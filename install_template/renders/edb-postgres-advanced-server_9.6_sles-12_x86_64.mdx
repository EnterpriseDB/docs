# Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server 9.6 on SLES 12 x86_64

This topic describes how to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server and includes steps for getting started with your cluster and creating a database.

There are three steps to completing an installation:

- Setting up the repository
- Installing the package
- Performing the initial configuration

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

To log in as a superuser:

```sh
sudo su -
```

## Setting up the Repository

1. To register with EDB to receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request)

### Install the repository configuration

```sh
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo
```

### Refresh the metadata

```sh
zypper refresh
```

### Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories

```sh
zypper install SUSEConnect
```

### Register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories

Replace 'REGISTRATION_CODE' and 'EMAIL' with your SUSE registration information

```sh
SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.4/x86_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.4/x86_64
```

### Install the following repository for PEM dependencies

```sh
zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache:/Modules/SLE_12_SP4/Apache:Modules.repo
```

### Refresh the metadata

```sh
zypper refresh
```

# Install OpenJDK (version 1.8) for Java based components

```sh
zypper -n install java-1_8_0-openjdk
```

## Installing the Package

```sh
zypper -n install edb-as96-server
```

## Initial Configuration

1. Initialize the database cluster:

   ```sh
   PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS="-E UTF-8" /usr/edb/as9.6/bin/edb-as-96-setup initdb
   ```

1. Start the database cluster:

   ```sh
   systemctl start edb-as-9.6
   ```

## Connecting to Your Database cluster

This section steps you through getting started with your cluster including logging in, ensuring the installation and initial configuration was successful, connecting to your cluster, and creating the user password.

1. To work in your cluster, login as `enterprisedb` user:

   ```sh
   su - enterprisedb
   ```

1. Connect to the database server using psql command line client:

   ```sh
   psql edb
   ```

   See [Managing Your Cluster > Connecting to Your Cluster], for more information including how to use pgAdmin4 to connect to your cluster using its graphical interface.

1. Then, assign a password to the database superuser `enterprisedb`:

   ```sh
   ALTER ROLE enterprisedb IDENTIFIED BY password;
   ```

## Creating a Database

This section steps you through creating and adding data to a simple database.

1. Create a database (named hr):

   ```sh
   CREATE DATABASE hr;
   ```

1. Connect to the new database and create a table (named dept):

   ```sh
   \c hr
   CREATE TABLE public.dept (deptno numeric(2) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT dept_pk
   PRIMARY KEY, dname varchar(14) CONSTRAINT dept_dname_uq UNIQUE, loc
   varchar(13));
   ```

1. Add data to the table:

   ```sh
   INSERT INTO dept VALUES (10,'ACCOUNTING','NEW YORK');
   INSERT into dept VALUES (20,'RESEARCH','DALLAS');
   ```

1. You can use simple SQL commands to query the database and retrieve information about the data you have added to the table:

   ```sh
   SELECT * FROM dept;
   deptno  |   dname    |   loc
   --------+------------+----------
   10      | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
   20      | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
   (2 rows)
   ```
