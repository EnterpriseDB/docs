title: Installing Failover Manager 4.4 on SLES 12 x86_64
---

To complete an installation:

- [Setting up the repository](#setting-up-the-repository)
- [Installing the package](#installing-the-package)
- [Initial configuration](#initial-configuration)

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

Before setting up the repository, you need to register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

## Setting up the repository

Setting up the repository is a one time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform these steps.

```shell
# Install the repository configuration and enter your EDB repository
# credentials when prompted
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
zypper install SUSEConnect

# Register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
# Replace 'REGISTRATION_CODE' and 'EMAIL' with your SUSE registration information
SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/x86_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/x86_64

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh
```

## Installing the package

```shell
zypper -n install edb-efm<4x>
```

Where `<4x>` is the version of Failover Manager you are installing.

## Initial configuration

If you are using Failover Manager to monitor a cluster owned by a user other than enterprisedb or postgres, see [Extending Failover Manager permissions](../04_configuring_efm/04_extending_efm_permissions/#extending_efm_permissions).

After installing on each node of the cluster:

1.  Modify the [cluster properties file](../04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#cluster_properties) on each node..
2.  Modify the [cluster members file](../04_configuring_efm/03_cluster_members/#cluster_members) on each node.
3.  If applicable, configure and test virtual IP address settings and any scripts that are identified in the cluster properties file.
4.  Start the agent on each node of the cluster. For more information, see [Controlling the Failover Manager service](../08_controlling_efm_service/#controlling-the-failover-manager-service).
