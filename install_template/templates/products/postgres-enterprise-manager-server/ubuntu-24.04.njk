{% block debianUbuntuNote %}!!! Note

      Ubuntu 20 changed the requirements for accepting certificates.

      - If you want to install the PEM agent on a machine with an old version of sslutils, then you must upgrade sslutils to 1.3. Version 1.3 has a 4096-bit RSA key and sha256 signature algorithm support added to it.
      - If you don't upgrade sslutils to 1.3, then PEM agent might fail to connect to the PEM backend database server, and it might log the error "ca md too weak."
