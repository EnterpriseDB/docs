Setting up the repository is a one time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform these steps.
```shell
# Install the repository configuration and enter your EDB repository
# credentials when prompted
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
zypper install SUSEConnect

# Register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
# Replace 'REGISTRATION_CODE' and 'EMAIL' with your SUSE registration information
SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/{{ platform.arch }}
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/{{ platform.arch }}

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh
```
