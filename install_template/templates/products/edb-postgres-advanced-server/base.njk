## Connecting to Your Database cluster

This section steps you through getting started with your cluster including logging in, ensuring the installation and initial configuration was successful, connecting to your cluster, and creating the user password.

1. To work in your cluster, login as `enterprisedb` user:

   ```sh
   su - enterprisedb
   ```
   
{% block connectdatabasecluster %}{% endblock connectdatabasecluster %}

1. Connect to the database server using psql command line client:

   ```sh
   psql edb
   ```
   See [Managing Your Cluster > Connecting to Your Cluster], for more information including how to use pgAdmin4 to connect to your cluster using its graphical interface.

1. Then, assign a password to the database superuser `enterprisedb`:

   ```sh
   ALTER ROLE enterprisedb IDENTIFIED BY password;
   ```

## Creating a Database

This section steps you through creating and adding data to a simple database.

1. Create a database (named hr):

   ```sh
   CREATE DATABASE hr;
   ```

1. Connect to the new database and create a table (named dept):

   ```sh
   \c hr
   CREATE TABLE public.dept (deptno numeric(2) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT dept_pk
   PRIMARY KEY, dname varchar(14) CONSTRAINT dept_dname_uq UNIQUE, loc
   varchar(13));
   ```

1. Add data to the table:

   ```sh
   INSERT INTO dept VALUES (10,'ACCOUNTING','NEW YORK');
   INSERT into dept VALUES (20,'RESEARCH','DALLAS');
   ```

1. You can use simple SQL commands to query the database and retrieve information about the data you have added to the table:

   ```sh
   SELECT * FROM dept;
   deptno  |   dname    |   loc
   --------+------------+----------
   10      | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
   20      | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
   (2 rows)
   ```
