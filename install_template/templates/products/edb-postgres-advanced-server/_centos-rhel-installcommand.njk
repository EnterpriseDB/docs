Installing the server package creates an operating system user named enterprisedb. The user is assigned a user ID (UID) and a group ID (GID). The user has no default password. Use the `passwd` command to assign a password for the user. The default shell for the user is `bash`, and the user's home directory is `/var/lib/edb/as{{ product.version }}`.
