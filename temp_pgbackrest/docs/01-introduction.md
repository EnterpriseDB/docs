## Introduction

pgBackRest is an easy-to-use backup and restore tool that aims to enable your organization to implement disaster recovery solutions for _Postgres_ databases. Taking an online hot backup of _Postgres_ and restoring it is now as easy as it could be!

pgBackRest [v2.32](https://github.com/pgbackrest/pgbackrest/releases/tag/release/2.32) is the current stable release. Release notes are on the [Releases](http://www.pgbackrest.org/release.html) page.

EDB collaborates with the community on this open-source software. The packages provided in EDB repositories are technically equivalent to the packages provided by the **PostgreSQL** community. All of the use cases shown in this document are fully tested and supported by **EDB Postgres Advanced Server**.
