EDB designs, establishes coding best practices, reviews, and verifies input validation for the logon UI for EDB Postgres product where present. EDB follows the same approach for additional input components, however, the nature of the product may require that it accepts freeform SQL, WMI, or other strings to be entered and submitted by trusted users for which limited validation is possible. In such cases it is not possible to prevent users from entering incorrect or otherwise dangerous inputs.

EDB reserves the right to add features to products that accept freeform SQL, WMI, or other potentially dangerous inputs from authenticated, trusted users in the future, but will ensure all such features are designed and tested to ensure they provide the minimum possible risk, and where possible, require superuser or equivalent privileges.
