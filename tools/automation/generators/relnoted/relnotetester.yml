- relnote: SDW support with Streaming Transaction
  component: bdr
  component_version: 5.6
  details: |
    One of the main advantages of streaming is that the WAL sender sends the partial transaction before it commits, which 
    reduces replication lag. Now, with streaming support, the WAL decoder does the same thing, but it streams to the LCRs
    segments. Eventually, the WAL sender will read the LCRs and mimic the same behavior of streaming large transactions
    before they commit. This provides the benefits of SDW, such as reduced CPU and disk space, as well as the benefits of
    streaming, such as reduced lag and disk space, since ".spill" files are not generated.

    The WAL decoder always streams the transaction to LCRs, but based on downstream requests, the WAL sender either 
    streams the transaction or just mimics the normal `BEGIN..COMMIT` scenario.

    In addition to the normal LCRs segment files, we create streaming files with the starting names 
    `STR_TXN_<file-name-format>` and `CAS_TXN_<file-name-format>` for each streamed transaction.
