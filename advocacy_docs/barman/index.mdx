Barman is a leading open source backup and recovery tool for PostgreSQL databases. We support it. 

<Attention>
    Looking for the official documentation for Barman? Head over to [pgbarman.org &rarr;](http://docs.pgbarman.org/)
</Attention>

Barman builds on the functionality provided by PostgreSQL's [pg_receivewal](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgreceivewal.html) and [pg_basebackup](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgbasebackup.html) tools, which are documented on postgresql.org. You'll also wish to be familiar with [configuring replication slots](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/warm-standby.html#STREAMING-REPLICATION-SLOTS) for the purpose of minimizing data loss.
