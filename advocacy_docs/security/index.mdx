<span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="advisories/cve20252506">Read Advisory</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Published: </span><span>2025/05/22</span>
<h4>pglogical 3.x, BDR/PGD 4.x and BDR/PGD 5.x allow unauthorized reads</h4>
<h5> All versions of pglogical 3.x, BDR/PGD 4.x and BDR/PGD 5.x prior to 3.7.26-ELS, 4.3.8-ELS and 5.8.0</h5>
</summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em>&nbsp;
When pglogical attempts to replicate data, it does not verify it is using a replication connection, which means a user with CONNECT access to a database configured for replication can execute the pglogical command to obtain read access to replicated tables. When pglogical runs it should verify it is running on a replication connection but does not perform this check. This vulnerability was introduced in the pglogical 3.x codebase, which is proprietary to EDB. The same code base has been integrated into BDR/PGD 4 and 5.

<h4>EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) authenticated file read permissions bypass using edbldr</h4>
<h5> All versions of EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) edbldr from 15.0 and prior to 15.7.0 and from 16.0 and prior to 16.3.0</h5>
</summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em>&nbsp;
All versions of EnterpriseDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) from 15.0 and prior to 15.7.0 and from 16.0 and prior to 16.3.0 may allow users using <code>edbldr</code> to bypass role permissions from <code>pg_read_server_files</code>. This could allow low privilege users to read files to which they would not otherwise have access.

<h4>EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) dbms_aq helper function may run arbitrary SQL as a superuser</h4>
<h5> All versions of EnterpriseDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) prior to 11.21.32, 12.16.20, 13.12.17, 14.9.0, 15.4.0</h5>

It contains the function _dbms_aq_move_to_exception_queue that may be used to elevate a user's privileges to superuser. This function accepts the OID of a table, and then accesses that table as the superuser by using SELECT and DML commands.

<h4>EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) UTL_FILE permission bypass</h4>
<h5> All versions of EnterpriseDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) prior to 11.21.32, 12.16.20, 13.12.17, 14.9.0, 15.4.0</h5>

<em>Summary:</em>&nbsp;

It may allow an authenticated user to bypass authorization requirements and access underlying implementation functions. When a superuser has configured file locations using CREATE DIRECTORY, these functions allow users to take a wide range of actions, including read, write, copy, rename, and delete.

<h4>Pgpool-II Authentication Bypass</h4>
<h5> All versions of EDB Pool prior to 4.5.1-4, PGPool-II versions prior to 4.6.1, 4.5.7, 4.4.12, 4.3.15, and 4.2.22</h5>
</summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em>&nbsp;
Pgpool-II contains an authentication bypass vulnerability that can be exploited under certain conditions. If an attacker exploits the vulnerability they may be able to log in to the system as an arbitrary user, which could allow them to read or tamper with data in the database, and/or disable the database.

<h4>PgBouncer "VALID UNTIL yesterday"</h4>
<h5> All versions of PGBouncer prior to 1.24.1, TPA prior to 23.38.0, PGAI Cloud Service prior to May 12, 2025</h5>
</summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em>&nbsp;
In PgBouncer, the <code>auth_query</code> mechanism does not consider the <code>VALID UNTIL</code> attribute set in PostgreSQL for user passwords.
This oversight allows users to authenticate using expired passwords, potentially granting unauthorized access. The flaw was fixed in [PgBouncer 1.24.1](https://www.pgbouncer.org/changelog.html#pgbouncer-124x).

<h4>PostgreSQL quoting APIs miss neutralizing quoting syntax in text that fails encoding validation</h4>
<h5> All versions of PostgreSQL, EPAS and PGE prior to 17.3, 16.7, 15.11, 14.16, and 13.19</h5>
</summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em>&nbsp;
Improper neutralization of quoting syntax in PostgreSQL libpq functions <code>PQescapeLiteral()</code>, <code>PQescapeIdentifier()</code>, <code>PQescapeString()</code>, and <code>PQescapeStringConn()</code> allows a database input provider to achieve SQL injection in certain usage patterns. Specifically, SQL injection requires the application to use the function result to construct input to psql, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal. Similarly, improper neutralization of quoting syntax in PostgreSQL command line utility programs allows a source of command line arguments to achieve SQL injection when client_encoding is <code>BIG5</code> and server_encoding is one of <code>EUC_TW</code> or <code>MULE_INTERNAL</code>. Versions before PostgreSQL 17.3, 16.7, 15.11, 14.16, and 13.19 are affected.

<h4>PostgreSQL relation replacement during pg_dump executes arbitrary SQL</h4>
<h5> All versions of PostgreSQL, EPAS and PGE prior to 16.4, 15.8, and 14.13</h5>
</summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em>&nbsp;
Time-of-check Time-of-use (TOCTOU) race condition in pg_dump in PostgreSQL allows an object creator to execute arbitrary SQL functions as the user running pg_dump, which is often a superuser. The attack involves replacing another relation type with a view or foreign table. The attack requires waiting for pg_dump to start, but winning the race condition is trivial if the attacker retains an open transaction. Versions before PostgreSQL 16.4, 15.8, 14.13, 13.16, and 12.20 are affected.

<h4>Restrict visibility of "pg_stats_ext" and "pg_stats_ext_exprs" entries to the table owner</h4>
<h5> All versions of PostgreSQL, EPAS and PGE prior to 16.3, 15.7, and 14.12</h5>
</summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em>&nbsp;
Missing authorization in PostgreSQL built-in views pg_stats_ext and pg_stats_ext_exprs allows an unprivileged database user to read most common values and other statistics from CREATE STATISTICS commands of other users. The most common values may reveal column values the eavesdropper could not otherwise read or results of functions they cannot execute. Installing an unaffected version only fixes fresh PostgreSQL installations, namely those that are created with the initdb utility after installing that version. Current PostgreSQL installations will remain vulnerable until they follow the instructions in the release notes, which are provided as a convenience in the below section. Within major versions 14-16, minor versions before PostgreSQL 16.3, 15.7, and 14.12 are affected. Versions before PostgreSQL 14 are unaffected.
