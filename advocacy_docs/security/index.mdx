<span>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<a href="advisories/cve20252506">Read Advisory</a>
&nbsp;&nbsp;Published: </span><span>2025/05/22</span>
<h4>pglogical 3.x, BDR/PGD 4.x and BDR/PGD 5.x allow unauthorized reads</h4>
<h5> All versions of pglogical 3.x, BDR/PGD 4.x and BDR/PGD 5.x prior to 3.7.26-ELS, 4.3.8-ELS and 5.8.0</h5>
</summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em>&nbsp;
When pglogical attempts to replicate data, it does not verify it is using a replication connection, which means a user with CONNECT access to a database configured for replication can execute the pglogical command to obtain read access to replicated tables. When pglogical runs it should verify it is running on a replication connection but does not perform this check. This vulnerability was introduced in the pglogical 3.x codebase, which is proprietary to EDB. The same code base has been integrated into BDR/PGD 4 and 5.

<h4>Unauthenticated gRPC API Access</h4>
<h5> Hybrid Manager (HM)</h5>
</summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em>&nbsp;
EDB Hybrid Manager contains a flaw that allows an unauthenticated attacker to directly access certain gRPC endpoints. This allows unauthorized access to critical internal gRPC APIs within a Hybrid Manager service due to missing authentication and authorization checks in the Istio Gateway configuration. This vulnerability has been remediated in EDB Hybrid Manager 1.3.3 and HM 2025.12, and customers should consider upgrading to the patched version as soon as possible.

<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em>&nbsp;
All versions of EnterpriseDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) from 15.0 and prior to 15.7.0 and from 16.0 and prior to 16.3.0 may allow users using <code>edbldr</code> to bypass role permissions from <code>pg_read_server_files</code>. This could allow low privilege users to read files to which they would not otherwise have access.

&nbsp;&nbsp;Updated: </span><span>2025/08/14</span>
<h4>PostgreSQL pg_dump newline in object name executes arbitrary code in psql client and in restore target server</h4>
<h5> All versions of Postgresql prior to 17.6, 16.10, 15.14, 14.19, 13.22 3.x, EDB Postgres Extended Server prior to 17.6.0, 16.10.0, 15.14.0, 14.19.0, 13.22, EDB Postgres Advanced Server prior to 17.6.0, 16.10.0, 15.14.0, 14.19.0, 13.22</h5>
</summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em>&nbsp;
Improper neutralization of newlines in pg_dump in PostgreSQL allows a user of the origin server to inject arbitrary code for restore-time execution as the client operating system account running psql to restore the dump, via psql meta-commands inside a purpose-crafted object name. The same attacks can achieve SQL injection as a superuser of the restore target server. pg_dumpall, pg_restore, and pg_upgrade are also affected.

<h4>PostgreSQL pg_dump lets superuser of origin server execute arbitrary code in psql client</h4>
<h5> All versions of Postgresql prior to 17.6, 16.10, 15.14, 14.19, 13.22 3.x, EDB Postgres Extended Server prior to 17.6.0, 16.10.0, 15.14.0, 14.19.0, 13.22, EDB Postgres Advanced Server prior to 17.6.0, 16.10.0, 15.14.0, 14.19.0, 13.22</h5>
</summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em>&nbsp;
Untrusted data inclusion in pg_dump in PostgreSQL allows a malicious superuser of the origin server to inject arbitrary code for restore-time execution as the client operating system account running psql to restore the dump, via psql meta-commands. 
pg_dumpall is also affected. pg_restore is affected when used to generate a plain-format dump. This is similar to MySQL CVE-2024-21096.

<h4>Pgpool-II Authentication Bypass</h4>
<h5> All versions of EDB Pool prior to 4.5.1-4, PGPool-II versions prior to 4.6.1, 4.5.7, 4.4.12, 4.3.15, and 4.2.22</h5>
</summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em>&nbsp;
Pgpool-II contains an authentication bypass vulnerability that can be exploited under certain conditions. If an attacker exploits the vulnerability they may be able to log in to the system as an arbitrary user, which could allow them to read or tamper with data in the database, and/or disable the database.

<h4>PgBouncer "VALID UNTIL yesterday"</h4>
<h5> All versions of PGBouncer prior to 1.24.1, TPA prior to 23.38.0, PGAI Cloud Service prior to May 12, 2025</h5>
</summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em>&nbsp;
In PgBouncer, the <code>auth_query</code> mechanism does not consider the <code>VALID UNTIL</code> attribute set in PostgreSQL for user passwords.
This oversight allows users to authenticate using expired passwords, potentially granting unauthorized access. The flaw was fixed in [PgBouncer 1.24.1](https://www.pgbouncer.org/changelog.html#pgbouncer-124x).

<h4>PostgreSQL quoting APIs miss neutralizing quoting syntax in text that fails encoding validation</h4>
<h5> All versions of PostgreSQL, EPAS and PGE prior to 17.3, 16.7, 15.11, 14.16, and 13.19</h5>
</summary>
<hr/>
<em>Summary:</em>&nbsp;
Improper neutralization of quoting syntax in PostgreSQL libpq functions <code>PQescapeLiteral()</code>, <code>PQescapeIdentifier()</code>, <code>PQescapeString()</code>, and <code>PQescapeStringConn()</code> allows a database input provider to achieve SQL injection in certain usage patterns. Specifically, SQL injection requires the application to use the function result to construct input to psql, the PostgreSQL interactive terminal. Similarly, improper neutralization of quoting syntax in PostgreSQL command line utility programs allows a source of command line arguments to achieve SQL injection when client_encoding is <code>BIG5</code> and server_encoding is one of <code>EUC_TW</code> or <code>MULE_INTERNAL</code>. Versions before PostgreSQL 17.3, 16.7, 15.11, 14.16, and 13.19 are affected.
