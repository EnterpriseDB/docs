## Summary

Summary

Improper neutralization of newlines in pg_dump in PostgreSQL allows a user of the origin server to inject arbitrary code for restore-time execution as the client operating system account running psql to restore the dump, via psql meta-commands inside a purpose-crafted object name. The same attacks can achieve SQL injection as a superuser of the restore target server. pg_dumpall, pg_restore, and pg_upgrade are also affected.
