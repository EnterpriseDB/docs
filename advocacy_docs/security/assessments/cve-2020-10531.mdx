## Important

This is an assessment of the impact of CVE-2020-10531 on EDB products and services. It links to and details the CVE and supplements that information with EDB's own assessment.

## Summary

The original vulnerability was an integer overflow leading to a heap-based buffer overflow in `UnicodeString::doAppend()` in ICU (International Components for Unicode) for C/C++ which existed up to (and including) version 66.1.

In the process of validating EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17, a release check identified the presence of a pre 67.1 version of the library being used.

It had been believed that existing versions of EPAS had been built with a later library version. 

While most EDB software builds against the operating system provided version of ICU, EDB Postgres Advanced Server can include EDB’s own build of ICU 66.1, specifically on RHEL7 on x86\_64/PPCLE, RHEL8 on x86\_64/PPCLE, SLES 12  x86\_64/PPCLE/s390x, and SLES 15 x86\_64/PPCLE/s390x. On RHEL9, the OS supplied library (version 67.1) is used.

EDB Postgres Extended and Postgres use the OS supplied ICU libraries, and are not affected by this vulnerability.

It has been established that EDB’s code does not use the vulnerable function.  
Assessment and mitigation: In the interests of ensuring that the vulnerable library doesn’t provide any surface for an attacker, we are releasing updated versions of all affected products.
