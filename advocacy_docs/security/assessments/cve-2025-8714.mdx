## Summary

Summary

Untrusted data inclusion in pg_dump in PostgreSQL allows a malicious superuser of the origin server to inject arbitrary code for restore-time execution as the client operating system account running psql to restore the dump, via psql meta-commands. 
pg_dumpall is also affected. pg_restore is affected when used to generate a plain-format dump. This is similar to MySQL CVE-2024-21096.
