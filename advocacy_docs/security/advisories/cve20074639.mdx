## Summary

EDB Postgres Advanced Server 8.2 (EPAS) does not properly handle certain debugging function calls that occur before a call to `pldbg_create_listener`, which allows remote authenticated users to cause a denial of service (daemon crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code via a SELECT statement that invokes a `pldbg_` function, as demonstrated by (1) `pldbg_get_stack` and (2) `pldbg_abort_target`, which triggers use of an uninitialized pointer.
