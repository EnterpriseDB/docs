## Summary

EDB Hybrid Manager contains a flaw that allows an unauthenticated attacker to directly access certain gRPC endpoints. This allows unauthorized access to critical internal gRPC APIs within a Hybrid Manager service due to missing authentication and authorization checks in the Istio Gateway configuration. This vulnerability has been remediated in EDB Hybrid Manager 1.3.3 and HM 2025.12, and customers should consider upgrading to the patched version as soon as possible.

The vulnerability is due to a misconfiguration in the Istio Gateway, which manages authentication and authorization for the affected endpoints. Certain APIs were previously not explicitly listed in the API gateway's security configuration, meaning an unauthorized user with network access to the HM environment could directly invoke these endpoints.
