After you've mastered the basics of securing your PostgreSQL database, you can dive deeper into intermediate topics.

These intermediate security techniques help to further safeguard your data, improve auditability, and reduce risks associated with more sophisticated attacks. By focusing on enhanced role management, encryption, fine-grained access control, auditing, and cloud-specific configurations, you can build a robust defense for your databases. 

Keep evolving your security posture by staying updated on emerging threats and security features in new PostgreSQL releases.

## Advanced role management and privileges

Effective management of roles and privileges is essential for maintaining a secure PostgreSQL environment.

- **Avoid using superuser roles.** Limit superuser privileges to only the most essential operations. Always create distinct, minimally privileged roles for day-to-day database tasks.

- **Create custom roles.** Create task-specific roles for finer privilege management. Rather than using a single, all-encompassing role, create custom roles for different functions like read-only, read-write, and admin tasks. This practice limits the scope of potential security breaches. For example:

```sql
CREATE ROLE read_only NOINHERIT;
GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA public TO read_only;
```

- **Establish role inheritance.** Use role inheritance to streamline privilege assignments and create hierarchies of roles that simplify privilege management. A parent role can be granted a specific set of privileges, which can then be inherited by child roles:

```sql
CREATE ROLE base_role;
CREATE ROLE admin_role INHERIT base_role;
```

- **Revoke public privileges.** Remove default permissions from the public role. By default, new databases and tables grant certain privileges to the public role. Best practice is to revoke these:

```sql
REVOKE ALL ON DATABASE mydb FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL ON SCHEMA public FROM PUBLIC;
```

## Fine-grained access control with row-level security

- **Enable row-level security.** Row-level security (RLS) provides fine-grained control over who can access specific rows in a table. This type of security is essential when different users need access to different subsets of data.

    Enforce RLS policies on sensitive tables. To activate RLS for a table, you first need to enable it:

```sql
ALTER TABLE employees ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
```

- **Define security policies.** Once RLS is enabled, you can create policies to specify which users can access or modify rows in the table. For example:

```sql
CREATE POLICY employee_policy ON employees
FOR SELECT
USING (employee_id = current_user);
```

### Database encryption

Encryption is critical for protecting data at rest and in transit. Intermediate PostgreSQL setups often leverage encryption to secure sensitive information.

- **Encrypt sensitive columns.** Use pgcrypto to encrypt sensitive data at the column level.  While PostgreSQL doesnâ€™t natively support column-level encryption, 
you can use client-side encryption libraries such as pgcrypto to encrypt and decrypt data. For example:

```sql
SELECT pgp_sym_encrypt('secret data', 'encryption key');
```
    Ensure that encryption keys are stored securely outside the database, such as in AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault, or other secure key management systems.

- **Use full disk encryption.** If column-level encryption isn't feasible, use full-disk encryption to secure the data directory. Encrypting the entire disk ensures that sensitive data is protected in the event of unauthorized physical access to the database server.

## pg_hba.conf advanced configurations

The `pg_hba.conf` file controls access to PostgreSQL at the network level. Intermediate configurations involve more complex filtering and control mechanisms.

- **Set granular network restrictions.** Configure specific IP ranges or hosts for different roles. Define access based on user, database, or IP address to create fine-grained network policies. For example, restrict administrative access to a specific IP range:

```bash
host    all    postgres    10.0.0.0/8    scram-sha-256
```

- **Separate roles by network.** Allow different roles based on their origin IP. You can create roles that have different levels of access based on their network of origin. For instance, you can create read-only users on a public network and read-write users on a private network:

```bash
host    all    read_only_user    0.0.0.0/0    scram-sha-256
host    all    read_write_user   10.0.0.0/8   scram-sha-256
```

## Database auditing and logging

Auditing is essential for identifying abnormal behavior and unauthorized access. It also helps in compliance with security standards like PCI-DSS and GDPR.

- **Enable pgaudit.** Use pgaudit for detailed logging of database activity. This extension provides detailed logging of SQL statements at various levels (DDL, DML, and more). To install and configure it:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pgaudit;
```

    To configure pgaudit to log SELECT statements:

```bash
pgaudit.log = 'read'
```

- **Configure fine-grained logging.** Customize logging configurations to capture DDL, DML, and more. PostgreSQL offers several levels of logging, but for performance reasons, fine-tune it.  
Enable specific logging for failed login attempts or DDL changes:

```bash
log_connections = on
log_disconnections = on
log_statement = 'ddl'
```

For more information on pgAudit, see the [pgAudit documentation](https://www.pgaudit.org).

## Monitoring and alerting

Intermediate PostgreSQL security requires robust monitoring and alerting. Several tools and configurations can help with this:

- **PostgreSQL monitoring tools.** Tools like pg_stat_statements, pgBadger, or third-party tools such as Prometheus and Grafana, provide insights into database activity and performance metrics.

- **CloudWatch for AWS Aurora.** For AWS Aurora PostgreSQL users, leverage CloudWatch to monitor database performance metrics and set up alarms for unusual patterns in CPU, memory, or I/O usage.

- **Alerts for suspicious activity.** Configure alerts for specific actions and abnormal behaviors, such as multiple failed login attempts, database role changes, or connections from unknown IP addresses. For example:

```bash
log_min_error_statement = 'ERROR'
log_min_duration_statement = 1000
```

## Database hardening

Hardening your PostgreSQL server is an intermediate security practice that reduces the attack surface by removing or disabling unnecessary features.

- **Remove unused extensions.** Extensions can increase the attack surface of PostgreSQL. Disable or remove any extensions you don't actively use. For example:

```sql
DROP EXTENSION IF EXISTS plperl;
```

- **Lock down data directory.** Ensure that the PostgreSQL data directory is accessible only by the PostgreSQL user. Use file system permissions (chmod 700) to lock down access:

```bash
chmod 700 /var/lib/postgresql/data
```

## Securing PostgreSQL on cloud providers

Cloud environments introduce additional layers of complexity. The following can help secure your PostgreSQL instances in the cloud:

- **AWS RDS encryption.** Use AWS RDS's built-in encryption for data at rest with KMS-managed keys. You can easily enable it while creating an RDS instance.

- **Network access restrictions.** Use cloud-level security groups or firewalls to restrict access to the PostgreSQL instance. Allow only trusted IPs or VPCs to connect to the database.

- **IAM authentication.** Use AWS IAM roles and policies to manage access to PostgreSQL instances. IAM authentication provides an extra layer of security, reducing the need for password management:

```bash
aws rds generate-db-auth-token --hostname <endpoint> --port 5432 --region <region> --username <db-user>
```

## Implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA)

Using MFA for database access further secures your system by requiring users to provide a second factor beyond a password. You can integrate PostgreSQL with an external identity provider (IdP) that supports MFA.

- **External identity providers.** For added security, integrate MFA with identity providers such as Okta, Google Identity, Azure AD, or AWS IAM.
