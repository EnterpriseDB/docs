The following are basic practices for securing your PostgreSQL installation.

## Install the latest version

- **Always use the most recent version.** Regularly update PostgreSQL to the latest stable release. For EDB releases, see the [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).

- **Apply security patches.** Ensure security patches are applied promptly. For EDB security vulnerabilities and advisories, see the [EDB Vulnerability disclosure policy](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/security/vulnerability-disclosure-policy/).

## Use strong authentication methods

PostgreSQL supports several authentication methods. Always use the most secure option available.

- **Password authentication.** Ensure that all users authenticate with strong passwords. Because it provides stronger hashing, use `scram-sha-256` for password hashing instead of `md5`.

- **LDAP/Kerberos/SSO.** Integrate centralized authentication systems like LDAP, Kerberos, or single sign-on (SSO) for enhanced security.

## Limit access with pg_hba.conf

PostgreSQL’s host-based access control file (`pg_hba.conf`) is your first line of defense for controlling who can connect to the database. To ensure security:

- **Restrict host connections.** Allow only trusted hosts.

- **Use CIDR notation.** Limit access to specific IP ranges in `pg_hba.conf`. Example:

```bash
host all all 192.168.1.0/24 scram-sha-256
```
- **Use local method.**  For connections from the same machine, use Unix domain sockets with peer authentication, limiting connections to system users.

## Enforce SSL/TLS connections

Encrypt traffic between the client and PostgreSQL server using SSL. This practice can prevent sensitive data (like passwords and query results) from being intercepted.

- **Enable SSL.** Ensure that `ssl = on` in `postgresql.conf`.

- **Use valid SSL certificates.** Use certificates for secure communication (self-signed or CA-signed).

- **Force SSL.** Ensure all connections use SSL via `pg_hba.conf`. Example:

```bash
hostssl all all 0.0.0.0/0 scram-sha-256
```

## Use role-based access control (RBAC)

PostgreSQL implements a robust role-based access control system. Some key practices include:

- **Principle of least privilege.** Grant roles the minimum permissions necessary.

- **Separate roles for users/applications.** Avoid using superuser accounts or the default postgres role for daily operations.

- **Use GRANT/REVOKE.** Assign specific privileges to roles. Example:

```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT ON my_table TO my_user;
```

## Use encrypted passwords

Make sure that passwords are stored using secure hashing methods (scram-sha-256 in modern PostgreSQL versions).

- **Enable scram-sha-256.** Configure PostgreSQL to store passwords securely by setting `password_encryption = 'scram-sha-256'` in your `postgresql.conf` file:

```bash
password_encryption = 'scram-sha-256'
```

## Audit and monitor database activity

Enable logging and auditing to keep track of database activity.

- **Enable logging.** Log all user connections and queries.

- **Track role changes.** Regularly audit role modifications and permissions to detect unauthorized changes.

- **Use pgAudit.** Third-party tools like pgAudit can enable detailed audit logging.

- **Enable connection and query logs.** Capture login attempts, successful connections, and queries executed using settings in `postgresql.conf`:

```bash
log_connections = on
log_disconnections = on
log_statement = 'all'
```

## Regular backups and secure backup storage

Backups are crucial, but they must also be secured. Be sure to:

- **Use encrypted backups.** Encrypt database backups to reduce the chance of unauthorized access.

- **Restrict backup access.** Allow only authorized personnel to access, view, or restore backups.

- **Test restores.** Regularly test backups to ensure they're complete and can be restored properly without any data integrity issues.

## Disable unnecessary features

Reduce your attack surface by disabling unused features:

- **Remove unused extensions.** Disable any extensions that aren't actively used.

- **Disable trust authentication.** Ensure `trust` authentication isn't used in production as it allows users to log in without a password.

- **Disable untrusted languages.** Prevent the use of languages that allow arbitrary code execution, such as PL/Python.

## Vulnerability scanning and penetration testing

- **Regularly scan for vulnerabilities.** Use security scanners to find vulnerabilities.

- **Penetration resting.** Test the security of your PostgreSQL instance. You may need to hire security professionals to test your database security periodically.

## Network security controls

Strengthen PostgreSQL’s security by securing the network it operates in.

- **Set firewall rules.** Restrict database access to necessary ports.

- **Limit network exposure.** Use VPNs or internal networks for database access. Avoid exposing PostgreSQL directly to the internet.

- **Use intrusion detection.** Use IDS tools to monitor for suspicious activity.

## Regularly review user permissions

- **Develop a review cadence.** Regularly review user and role permissions to ensure no unnecessary privileges were granted. 

- **Remove unnecessary privileges.** Periodically review and revoke unnecessary privileges. Remove access immediately when a user no longer needs it.

## Secure OS and file permissions

PostgreSQL runs on an operating system that also needs to be secured.

- **Restrict file access.** Ensure that only the PostgreSQL service user can access critical files such as the data directory and logs. Set restrictive permissions (700) on the data directory.

- **Harden the OS.** Apply operating system hardening practices, including disabling unnecessary services and ensuring regular OS updates.
