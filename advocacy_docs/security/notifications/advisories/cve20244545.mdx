## Summary

All versions of EnterpriseDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) from 15.0 and prior to 15.7.0 and from 16.0 and prior to 16.3.0 may allow users using `edbldr` to bypass role permissions from `pg_read_server_files`. This could allow low privilege users to read files to which they would not otherwise have access.

## Remediation

| Product | VRMF | Remediation/First Fix |
|---------|------|-----------------------|
| EPAS | All versions from 15.0 and prior to 15.7.0 | [Upgrade EPAS 15 to Minor release](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/15/upgrading/04_upgrading_an_installation_with_pg_upgrade/01_performing_an_upgrade/) |
| EPAS | All versions from 16.0 and prior to 16.7.0 | [Upgrade EPAS 16 to Minor release](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/16/upgrading/minor_upgrade/) |

!!! Warning
If impacted users are currently relying on non-superusers to run edbldr and read data from the server filesystem without any special permissions, the fixed versions of EPAS could break these workflows. It is recommended that users do one of the following:
* Grant such users the `pg_read_server_files` role
* Change the way data is being loaded into the database, such as loading files from standard input rather than specifying a pathname.
