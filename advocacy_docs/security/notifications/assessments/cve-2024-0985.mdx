Important: This is an assessment of the impact of CVE-2024-0895 on EDB products and services. It links to and details the CVE and supplements that information with EDB's own assessment.

## Summary 

Late privilege drop in REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY in PostgreSQL allows an object creator to execute arbitrary SQL functions as the command issuer. The command intends to run SQL functions as the owner of the materialized view, enabling safe refresh of untrusted materialized views. The victim is a superuser or member of one of the attacker's roles. The attack requires luring the victim into running REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW CONCURRENTLY on the attacker's materialized view. As part of exploiting this vulnerability, the attacker creates functions that use CREATE RULE to convert the internally-built temporary table to a view. Versions before PostgreSQL 15.6, 14.11, 13.14, and 12.18 are affected. The only known exploit does not work in PostgreSQL 16 and later. For defense in depth, PostgreSQL 16.2 adds the protections that older branches are using to fix their vulnerability.

!!! Note 
The exploit referred to in this CVE did not work on PostgreSQL 16. The
same defensive code as other releases has been added in PostgreSQL 16.2, EPAS
16.2 and PGE 16.2 to ensure strength in depth. We strongly recommend upgrading
your PostgreSQL 16, EPAS 16 and PGE 16 deployments to these versions.
