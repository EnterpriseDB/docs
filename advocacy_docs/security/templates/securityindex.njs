EDB is committed to a security first approach, from the products we build and the platforms we operate, to the services we provide our customers. Transparency is a core principle for the program and part of this effort includes welcoming incoming reports so that we can address concerns surfaced by our customers or security researchers. Youâ€™ll also find it in our advisories, which detail issues found and the required fixes or mitigations needed to keep your data and databases safe.

## Policies
