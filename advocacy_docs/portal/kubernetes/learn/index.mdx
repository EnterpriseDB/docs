title: Kubernetes at EDB
navTitle: Learning Resources
description: Understand how EDB leverages Kubernetes to deliver modern Postgres services, and how you can work with Kubernetes-based tools and practices across our platform.
---

Kubernetes has become the industry standard for deploying and operating modern container-based applications—including databases.

At EDB, Kubernetes is the infrastructure foundation that powers our next-generation Postgres platforms. It enables cloud-native practices such as automated deployment, self-healing services, portable environments, and declarative infrastructure management. Our products—such as Hybrid Manager and EDB Postgres AI—run directly on Kubernetes and depend on it to orchestrate Postgres clusters in cloud, on-prem, and hybrid environments.

We do **not** attempt to document or teach Kubernetes fundamentals here. Instead, this section focuses on:

-   How **Kubernetes is used within EDB platforms**
-   Best practices for running **Postgres on Kubernetes**
-   Role-specific guidance for developers, DBAs, SREs, and platform engineers
-   Integration points between EDB products and the Kubernetes ecosystem
-   Pointers to external Kubernetes learning resources

## This section is part of the [EDB Developer Portal](/portal).

## Kubernetes across EDB products

### Hybrid Manager

Hybrid Manager is EDB’s unified control plane for managing Postgres across environments—including cloud, on-prem, and hybrid. It is fully Kubernetes-native and uses a suite of Kubernetes operators and workloads to:

-   Create and manage Postgres clusters using Custom Resources
-   Perform lifecycle operations like backup, restore, upgrades, and failover
-   Integrate with monitoring and alerting systems via Prometheus and Grafana
-   Automate scaling and availability through Kubernetes-native primitives

Whether you're running in AWS, GCP, RHOS, or a private Kubernetes cluster, Hybrid Manager abstracts infrastructure complexity while giving you full Kubernetes visibility and control when needed.

### EDB Postgres® AI for CloudNativePG™ Global Cluster

A Kubernetes operator for deploying and managing **EDB Postgres Distributed** clusters in multi-cloud, multi-region, or hybrid environments. It supports:

-   Distributed HA topologies
-   Geo-redundancy and global replication
-   Active-active Postgres deployments

→ See the [Global Cluster documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/edb-postgres-ai/platforms-and-tools/kubernetes/)

### EDB Postgres® AI for CloudNativePG™ Cluster

An operator **based on** CloudNativePG™, this solution manages traditional Postgres clusters with added capabilities for enterprise needs, such as:

-   Compatibility with Oracle workloads
-   Expanded platform support including OpenShift and IBM Power
-   Enhanced high availability and lifecycle controls

→ See the [Cluster Operator documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/edb-postgres-ai/platforms-and-tools/kubernetes/)

* * *

### CloudNativePG™

CloudNativePG™ is an open source Kubernetes operator hosted by the CNCF and co-developed by EDB. It is a foundational building block for running Postgres natively in Kubernetes and is ideal for teams starting with open tools.
