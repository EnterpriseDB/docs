description: How to manage Kubernetes PersistentVolumes and storage for Hybrid Manager and managed Postgres services.
---

This how-to guide explains how to manage Kubernetes PersistentVolumes (PVs) and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs) that support Hybrid Manager and EDB-managed Postgres services.

**Important:** Storage behavior and capabilities differ across cloud service providers (CSPs) and Kubernetes platforms.
Before applying these procedures, review the platform-specific operator guidance for your environment.

- [GCP operator](/edb-postgres-ai/portal/kubernetes/learn/explained/gcp-operator)
- [AWS operator](/edb-postgres-ai/portal/kubernetes/learn/explained/aws-operator)
- [RHOS operator](/edb-postgres-ai/portal/kubernetes/learn/explained/rhos-operator)

For general storage architecture recommendations, see [Kubernetes storage best practices](/edb-postgres-ai/portal/kubernetes/learn/explained/hybrid-manager/k8s-storage-best-practices).

Hybrid Manager-managed Postgres clusters and platform services rely heavily on Kubernetes PVCs for data durability and reliability.
Correctly managing storage is critical for maintaining service availability and performance.

## Common storage management tasks

Typical storage management tasks for Hybrid Manager on Kubernetes include:

- Inspecting PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims
- Checking PVC capacity and usage
- Expanding PersistentVolumeClaims
- Validating StorageClass configuration
- Migrating PVCs between nodes or storage backends
- Troubleshooting storage-related issues

## Inspect PersistentVolumes and PersistentVolumeClaims

Start by reviewing PVCs in your Hybrid Manager and database namespaces.

Inspect PVCs:

- Identify PVCs associated with Postgres StatefulSets (often named like `<cluster-name>-<instance-id>` or with `-wal` for WAL volumes).
- Inspect PVC capacity, usage, and status.
- Verify PVCs are Bound and not stuck in Pending.

Inspect PersistentVolumes:

- Validate that PVs backing your PVCs are healthy.
- Check reclaim policy (usually `Delete` for dynamic provisioning).
- Monitor PV performance where possible.

## Check PVC capacity and usage

Monitor PVC usage:

- Monitor filesystem usage inside Postgres Pods (common cause of out-of-space errors).
- Set up Prometheus alerts for PVC nearing capacity (e.g. 80% full).
- Investigate high usage trends early to avoid disruption.

PVCs do not shrink automatically — monitor growth patterns and plan expansions proactively.

## Expand PersistentVolumeClaims

Expanding PVCs is supported when:

- The StorageClass used supports `allowVolumeExpansion`.
- The cloud provider or CSI driver supports volume expansion.

To expand a PVC:

- Edit the PVC resource to request a larger size.
- Kubernetes will resize the underlying volume if supported.
- Postgres Pods must detect the resized filesystem — in some cases, a Pod restart is required to recognize new space.

Validate expansion carefully — see [Expand Kubernetes storage](./expand-kubernetes-storage).

## Validate StorageClass configuration

Ensure that StorageClasses used for Hybrid Manager workloads:

- Use SSD-backed block storage (no NFS).
- Are configured with `WaitForFirstConsumer` for AZ alignment.
- Allow volume expansion.
- Use appropriate filesystem (ext4 or xfs).

Incorrect StorageClass configuration is a common source of performance or stability issues.

See full recommendations in [Kubernetes storage best practices](/edb-postgres-ai/portal/kubernetes/learn/explained/hybrid-manager/k8s-storage-best-practices).

## Migrate PVCs (advanced)

Migrating PVCs is sometimes needed during cluster upgrades or storage backend changes:

- Options include tools like Velero with Restic, or CSI snapshots and restore workflows.
- PVC migration requires careful validation to ensure data integrity.
- Test migration workflows in dev/test environments before using in production.

## Troubleshoot storage-related issues

Common issues to check:

- PVC stuck Pending → usually StorageClass or quota problem.
- PVC full → monitor usage, expand as needed.
- Volume mount errors → check node health, CSI driver status, cloud provider volume status.
- PVC performance issues → validate IOPS, latency, and backing disk health.

See [Troubleshooting Kubernetes](/portal/kubernetes/learn/how-to/troubleshooting-on-kubernetes) for general troubleshooting patterns.

## Summary checklist

- Regularly inspect PVC and PV status.
- Monitor PVC capacity and usage trends.
- Expand PVCs proactively when needed.
- Validate StorageClass configuration matches best practices.
- Plan and test PVC migration workflows carefully.
- Troubleshoot storage issues using layered analysis (PVC, PV, node, CSI driver, cloud provider).
