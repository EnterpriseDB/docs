This how-to guide explains how to back up Kubernetes PersistentVolumes (PVs) used by Hybrid Manager

For general storage architecture recommendations, see [Kubernetes storage best practices](/edb-postgres-ai/portal/kubernetes/learn/explained/hybrid-manager/k8s-storage-best-practices).
For troubleshooting guidance, see [Troubleshooting Kubernetes](./troubleshooting-on-kubernetes).

**Important:** Backup methods and tooling vary by Kubernetes platform and cloud provider.


## Understand backup requirements

Hybrid Manager Postgres clusters store critical data on Kubernetes PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).
Backups are required to meet disaster recovery (DR), compliance, and operational needs.

Typical backup goals:

- Protect Postgres data volume (PVC)
- Protect WAL volume (if used)
- Protect critical Hybrid Manager platform data (where applicable)

Important notes:

- **Use application-aware backups** whenever possible.
- Avoid relying on raw PVC snapshots alone unless coordinated with database quiesce.
- Hybrid Manager supports database-native backup pipelines → these should be your primary backup mechanism.
- PVC-level backups can be used as an additional DR safeguard.

## Backup methods

Common backup approaches for Kubernetes PVs:

- **Database-native backup (preferred)**
Use Hybrid Manager or Postgres Operator backup features to perform database-consistent backups to object storage.

- **Volume snapshot-based backup**
Use cloud-native or CSI snapshot capabilities to create point-in-time snapshots of PVs.

- **Filesystem-level backup**
Use Restic or similar tools to back up PVC content at the filesystem level.

Each method has trade-offs — see below.

## Database-native backup (preferred)

Hybrid Manager-managed Postgres clusters support:

- Scheduled backups to object storage (S3, GCS, Azure Blob)
- Point-in-time recovery where supported
- Consistent backups that avoid filesystem-level race conditions

**Always enable and test database-native backups first.**
PVC backups should complement, not replace, these backups.

## Volume snapshot-based backup

If using CSI snapshots:

- Verify that your StorageClass supports volume snapshots.
- Use Kubernetes VolumeSnapshot and VolumeSnapshotContent resources to manage snapshots.
- Coordinate snapshot timing to avoid capturing partial database writes.

Snapshot limitations:

- Not always supported on all platforms or storage backends.
- Not guaranteed to capture a crash-consistent Postgres state unless coordinated.

Use snapshots primarily for:

- Fast recovery within the same cluster
- Additional DR layer in conjunction with database-native backups

## Filesystem-level backup (Restic)

For advanced use cases:

- Use Restic or similar tools to back up PVC content via file-level copy.
- Requires running a temporary Pod with PVC mounted read-only.
- Requires careful coordination to avoid capturing inconsistent state.

Filesystem-level backup can be useful for:

- Off-cluster archival
- Backup of other types of PVCs (non-Postgres)
- Air-gapped environments

## Key considerations

When implementing any PVC backup:

- Validate backup consistency — perform test restores.
- Coordinate backup timing with database state.
- Monitor backup success and storage health.
- Validate retention policies and compliance requirements.
- Document restore procedures.

## Summary checklist

- Enable and test database-native backups first.
- Validate CSI snapshot support and configuration.
- Implement volume snapshot backup where appropriate.
- Implement filesystem-level backup for additional DR or specific needs.
- Coordinate and test all backup methods.
- Document and monitor backup and restore procedures.
