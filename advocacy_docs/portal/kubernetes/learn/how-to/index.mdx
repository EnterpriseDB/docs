Kubernetes is used as a foundational technology within the EDB Platformâ€”particularly in Hybrid Manager and EDB-managed Postgres services.
While EDB does not sell Kubernetes directly, we rely on it as the orchestration layer for many critical platform capabilities.

This section provides **task-focused procedures** to help you operate and troubleshoot Kubernetes environments that support EDB Platform services.
The goal is not to teach Kubernetes in depth, but to give you practical guidance on common operational tasks you may encounter when working with EDB Platform deployments.

## When to use this section

Use these guides when you need to:

-   Operate Kubernetes clusters supporting EDB Platform services (Hybrid Manager, managed Postgres)
-   Troubleshoot issues that affect EDB Platform services running on Kubernetes
-   Monitor cluster health and resource usage
-   Understand how Kubernetes operations may impact the EDB Platform

If you are new to Kubernetes, start with the [Kubernetes explained](/portal/kubernetes/learn/explained) section to build foundational understanding.
