# Manage Kubernetes networking

This how-to guide explains how to manage Kubernetes networking components that support Hybrid Manager and EDB-managed Postgres services.

For background on recommended networking architecture, see [Kubernetes networking best practices](../explained/hybrid-manager/manage-kubernetes-networking).
For troubleshooting guidance, see [Troubleshooting Kubernetes](./troubleshooting-on-kubernetes).

**Important:** Networking behavior differs across cloud providers and Kubernetes platforms.
Before managing networking in production environments, review platform-specific operator guidance:

-   [GCP operator](../explained/gcp-operator)
-   [AWS operator](../explained/aws-operator)
-   [RHOS operator](../explained/rhos-operator)

## Common networking management tasks

Typical networking tasks for Hybrid Manager on Kubernetes include:

-   Inspecting and managing Services (ClusterIP, LoadBalancer)
-   Managing Ingress resources
-   Applying and validating NetworkPolicies
-   Debugging connectivity issues
-   Monitoring service endpoints

## Inspect and manage Services

Hybrid Manager and Postgres services use Kubernetes Services for connectivity:

-   **ClusterIP Services** → internal communication (Postgres primary, replicas, Hybrid Manager components)
-   **LoadBalancer Services** → external access (UI/API endpoints if configured)

To inspect Services:

-   Use `kubectl get svc -n <namespace>` to list Services.
-   Verify `EXTERNAL-IP` is assigned correctly for LoadBalancer Services.
-   Check `Endpoints` to ensure correct Pods are attached.
-   Review Service annotations for cloud provider-specific behavior.

Managing Services:

-   Avoid manual edits to Services created by operators — these are managed declaratively.
-   Use Service annotations to control LoadBalancer behavior where supported.
-   Validate firewall rules and cloud SecurityGroups match Service exposure.

## Manage Ingress resources

Hybrid Manager can use Ingress to expose services:

-   OpenShift: Routes are used instead of Ingress.
-   EKS/GKE/AKS: NGINX Ingress or ALB Ingress commonly used.

Managing Ingress:

-   Inspect Ingress resources with `kubectl get ingress -n <namespace>`.
-   Validate Ingress controller health and configuration.
-   Check Ingress annotations for behavior tuning (timeouts, TLS settings, WAF integration).

Managing TLS:

-   Use cert-manager to automate TLS certificate management where possible.
-   Validate that Ingress resources correctly reference TLS secrets.

## Apply and validate NetworkPolicies

Use Kubernetes NetworkPolicies to control Pod-to-Pod and Pod-to-external traffic.

Managing NetworkPolicies:

-   Define NetworkPolicies per namespace or per component.
-   Test policies carefully to avoid blocking necessary traffic (especially replication and monitoring).
-   Validate NetworkPolicy enforcement using test Pods (e.g. busybox).

Typical patterns:

-   Allow Hybrid Manager components to communicate with each other and with Postgres.
-   Deny all unnecessary traffic by default.
-   Allow monitoring traffic from observability stack to Pods.

Validating policies:

-   Use tools like `kubectl get networkpolicy -n <namespace>` to inspect policies.
-   Test connectivity with simple tools (e.g. netcat, curl) inside Pods.

## Debug connectivity issues

When troubleshooting network issues:

-   Check Service `Endpoints` → missing endpoints often indicate Pod readiness problems.
-   Validate DNS resolution inside the cluster → use tools like `nslookup` or `dig` inside Pods.
-   Inspect Ingress controller logs for errors.
-   Validate cloud LoadBalancer health checks and status.
-   Check NetworkPolicies → look for unintentionally blocked traffic.

For detailed troubleshooting guidance, see [Troubleshooting Kubernetes](./troubleshooting-on-kubernetes).

## Monitor service endpoints

Best practices:

-   Monitor Kubernetes Service `Endpoints` for expected readiness.
-   Monitor LoadBalancer health status (cloud provider dashboards or metrics).
-   Validate Ingress availability and TLS validity.
-   Set up synthetic monitoring for key user-facing endpoints (Hybrid Manager UI/API).

Service-level monitoring complements Pod-level and infrastructure monitoring.

## Summary checklist

-   Regularly inspect and validate Services and Endpoints.
-   Manage Ingress and TLS carefully per platform conventions.
-   Apply and validate NetworkPolicies to enforce security boundaries.
-   Debug connectivity issues systematically across layers.
-   Monitor service availability continuously.
