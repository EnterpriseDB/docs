description: How to back up critical Hybrid Manager configuration components on Kubernetes.
---

This how-to guide explains how to back up **critical configuration components** for Hybrid Manager (HM) running on Kubernetes.

Backing up configuration is important for:

- Disaster recovery (DR)
- Re-creating environments in new clusters
- Migrating Hybrid Manager to new clusters or cloud environments
- Ensuring that platform settings and credentials can be restored if needed

**Important:** This guide focuses on backing up **Hybrid Manager platform configuration** — not EDB-managed Postgres database backups.
For Postgres backup guidance, see [Backup Kubernetes PersistentVolumes](/portal/kubernetes/learn/how-to/backup-kubernetes-pv) and your database operator documentation.

## What to back up

The following Kubernetes resources should be included in your configuration backup:

- **Secrets** containing:
- Object storage credentials (example: `edb-object-storage` Secret)
- Image pull secrets (example: `edb-cred`)
- TLS certificates used by Ingress / LoadBalancers (if applicable)
- Any additional platform-specific Secrets (check `upm-*` namespaces)

- **ConfigMaps** containing:
- Platform settings (if stored in ConfigMaps)
- Transporter or Beacon configuration (if present)
- Monitoring configuration overrides (if used)
- Any other configuration stored in ConfigMaps in `upm-*` namespaces or operator namespaces

- **Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs)** → typically not needed for regular config backup, but document operator versions and applied CRDs for full environment backup.

## How to back up Secrets

For each relevant namespace (example: `upm-ui`, `upm-api-*`, `postgresql-operator-system`, `transporter-*`, `storage-location-operator`):

1. List Secrets:

`kubectl get secrets -n <namespace>`

2. Export Secrets:

`kubectl get secret <secret-name> -n <namespace> -o yaml > <secret-name>.yaml`

3. Store exported YAML files securely — treat Secrets as sensitive data.

**Important:** Do not commit Secrets to source control without encryption.

## How to back up ConfigMaps

For each relevant namespace:

1. List ConfigMaps:

`kubectl get configmaps -n <namespace>`

2. Export ConfigMaps:

`kubectl get configmap <configmap-name> -n <namespace> -o yaml > <configmap-name>.yaml`

3. Store exported ConfigMap YAML files with other configuration backups.

## Backup automation

You may automate backup of Secrets and ConfigMaps using:

- Scheduled backup Jobs or CronJobs in Kubernetes
- Tools like Velero (supports backup of ConfigMaps, Secrets, CRDs)
- GitOps workflows (where safe and appropriate)

Always validate that your backup automation captures:

- Namespaces and resources relevant to Hybrid Manager
- Sensitive data handling (Secrets must be encrypted)

## Recommended backup cadence

- After initial Hybrid Manager deployment → full configuration backup
- After significant platform changes (new object storage credentials, new TLS certificates)
- Periodically (aligned with DR testing cadence)
- Before performing major cluster changes or migrations

## Restoring configuration

To restore:

- Apply backed up Secrets and ConfigMaps to the target cluster:

`kubectl apply -f <secret-or-configmap>.yaml`

- Validate that components start cleanly with restored configuration.
- Review documentation for component-specific behaviors on config restore (some may require Pod restart).

## Summary checklist

- Identify key Secrets and ConfigMaps for Hybrid Manager platform.
- Export and securely store configuration backups.
- Automate configuration backup where possible.
- Maintain backup cadence aligned with environment changes.
- Validate restore procedures regularly.
