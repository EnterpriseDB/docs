This how-to guide explains how to troubleshoot **Hybrid Manager (HM)** platform components running on Kubernetes.

This covers platform services such as:

-   Hybrid Manager UI and API services
-   Postgres operator
-   PGD operator
-   Transporter services
-   Storage location operator
-   Beacon and telemetry components
-   Other UPM platform services

For guidance on managing Postgres clusters, see [Troubleshooting Kubernetes](/portal/kubernetes/learn/how-to/troubleshooting-on-kubernetes)

## Understand Hybrid Manager component architecture

Hybrid Manager services are deployed across multiple namespaces:

-   `upm-ui` → UI service
-   `upm-api-*` → API services
-   `postgresql-operator-system` → Postgres operator
-   `pgd-operator-system` → PGD operator (if used)
-   `transporter-*` → Transporter services
-   `storage-location-operator` → Storage location services
-   `upm-beacon`, `upm-beaco-ff-base`, other `upm-*` namespaces → telemetry and support components

Each service typically runs as a Kubernetes Deployment with associated Pods.

## Common symptoms and investigation steps

### Hybrid Manager UI not responding

Symptoms:

-   UI unavailable or slow
-   5xx errors in browser

Investigation:

-   Check UI Pod status: `kubectl get pods -n upm-ui`
-   Check UI Pod logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name> -n upm-ui`
-   Check associated Ingress or LoadBalancer health
-   Validate API services are reachable — UI depends on API

### Hybrid Manager API issues

Symptoms:

-   API returns errors or is unreachable
-   UI shows partial data or errors

Investigation:

-   Check API service Pods: `kubectl get pods -n upm-api-*`
-   Check API Pod logs for errors: `kubectl logs <pod-name> -n <upm-api-*>`
-   Validate Service Endpoints are correct
-   Check Postgres operator health — API depends on operator state

### Operator errors

Symptoms:

-   Postgres clusters not provisioning
-   Cluster stuck in Pending or Error state
-   Operator reconciliation errors

Investigation:

-   Check Postgres operator Pods: `kubectl get pods -n postgresql-operator-system`
-   Check operator logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name> -n postgresql-operator-system`
-   Check Cluster CR status and Events
-   Validate associated PVCs and Services

### Transporter or backup issues

Symptoms:

-   Backups failing or not visible
-   Transporter jobs not running

Investigation:

-   Check Transporter Pods: `kubectl get pods -n transporter-*`
-   Check relevant Pod logs for errors
-   Validate IRSA or Workload Identity configuration
-   Check object storage access credentials

### Beacon and telemetry issues

Symptoms:

-   Monitoring not available
-   Missing metrics or events

Investigation:

-   Check `upm-beacon` and `upm-beaco-ff-base` Pods
-   Validate Fluent Bit → Loki pipeline (see [Use EDB observability stack](./use-edb-observability-stack))
-   Check Prometheus targets and scraping status

## Log locations and patterns

Component logs are typically available in:

-   **Kubernetes logs:** `kubectl logs`
-   **Grafana Explore → Loki:** logs aggregated across components

Common log patterns:

-   Operator reconciliation errors → in operator logs
-   API call errors → in API service logs
-   UI errors → in UI service logs
-   Backup errors → in Transporter or Beacon logs
-   Storage access errors → in Storage location operator logs

## When to restart components

If a component is consistently failing or stuck:

-   Follow [Restart Hybrid Manager components](./restart-hybrid-manager-components) procedure.
-   Monitor after restart to validate behavior.

## When to escalate

Escalate to support when:

-   Persistent errors remain after component restart
-   Operator unable to reconcile Cluster CR
-   Data integrity concerns arise
-   Multiple Hybrid Manager components are failing simultaneously

Capture relevant logs and Events before escalation.

## Summary checklist

-   Understand Hybrid Manager component architecture and namespaces.
-   Investigate Pods and logs for relevant component.
-   Validate networking, storage, and dependent services.
-   Use observability stack (Grafana, Loki) to correlate logs and metrics.
-   Restart components when appropriate.
-   Escalate complex issues with supporting data.
