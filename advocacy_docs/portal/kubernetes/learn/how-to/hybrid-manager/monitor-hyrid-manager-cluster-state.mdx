description: How to monitor Hybrid Manager cluster state and key components using the EDB observability stack and Kubernetes tools.
---

This how-to guide explains how to monitor the **state of the Hybrid Manager (HM) cluster** and its key components.

This is useful for:

- Understanding current system health
- Monitoring ongoing Hybrid Manager operations
- Establishing baseline cluster state
- Supporting troubleshooting workflows
- Performing periodic system checks

**Important:** This guide covers monitoring Hybrid Manager platform components — not the managed Postgres clusters.
For Postgres cluster monitoring, see [Monitoring Kubernetes clusters](/portal/kubernetes/learn/how-to/monitor-kubernetes-cluster).

## What to monitor

Monitor the following aspects of the Hybrid Manager environment:

- Hybrid Manager UI/API availability and responsiveness
- Operator health and reconciliation activity
- Backup agent and Transporter job status
- Storage location operator status
- Beacon and telemetry activity
- Log pipeline health (Loki / Fluent Bit)
- Kubernetes cluster resource health (nodes, Pods, PVCs, Services)

## Key tools and data sources

Use the following tools:

- **Grafana dashboards** → metrics and high-level system views
- **Prometheus** → raw metrics exploration
- **Loki (via Grafana Explore)** → component logs
- **kubectl** → Kubernetes component status and Events
- **Cloud provider dashboards** → LoadBalancer health, storage health (optional)

## Grafana dashboards to monitor

Recommended dashboards:

- **Kubernetes cluster dashboard** → node health, resource usage, Pod health
- **Hybrid Manager platform dashboard** → UI/API availability, operator metrics, Transporter metrics
- **Postgres operator dashboard** → operator health, reconciliation metrics
- **Transporter dashboard** → backup and data movement metrics
- **Beacon/Telemetry dashboard** → data flow to observability stack

Work with your platform team to validate and tune these dashboards.

## Key Kubernetes checks

Use `kubectl` to monitor component health:

- `kubectl get pods -A` → look for Pending, CrashLoopBackOff, Error states
- `kubectl get nodes` → validate node Ready status and resource pressure
- `kubectl get pvc -A` → monitor PVC capacity and binding status
- `kubectl get svc -A` → validate LoadBalancer and Service endpoints

## Key log checks

Use Loki and/or `kubectl logs`:

- Look for recent errors in API, UI, operator, Transporter, and Beacon logs.
- Validate regular reconciliation activity in operator logs.
- Validate successful backup and Transporter job completion.
- Look for errors in Fluent Bit or Loki components (log pipeline health).

## Recommended monitoring cadence

- **Ongoing** → dashboard and alert monitoring
- **Daily checks** → Pod health, node health, key component logs
- **Pre/post change** → baseline and compare component state
- **Periodic validation** → test full monitoring pipeline (logs, metrics, dashboards)

## Summary checklist

- Use Grafana dashboards to monitor overall Hybrid Manager platform state.
- Use Prometheus for detailed metric validation.
- Use Loki and `kubectl logs` for log-based troubleshooting.
- Monitor Kubernetes node, Pod, PVC, and Service health.
- Establish baseline state and monitor deviations.
- Perform regular cluster state validation to detect emerging issues.
