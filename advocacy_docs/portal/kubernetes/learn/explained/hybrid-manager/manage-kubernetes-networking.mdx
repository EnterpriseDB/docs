# Kubernetes networking best practices

Hybrid Manager runs on Kubernetes and depends on Kubernetes networking to provide reliable connectivity for platform components, managed databases, and user access.
A well-configured Kubernetes networking layer is essential for performance, resiliency, and security.

This page provides **networking best practices** for Kubernetes clusters that support Hybrid Manager and EDB-managed Postgres services. It complements the general [Minimum and recommended Kubernetes specs](./minimum-recommended-k8s-specs) and [Kubernetes storage best practices](./k8s-storage-best-practices).

For background on how Kubernetes is used in Hybrid Manager, see [Kubernetes in Hybrid Manager](../k8-in-hybrid-manager).

## Use multi-AZ networking for high availability

When deploying Kubernetes clusters across multiple Availability Zones (AZs), ensure your networking configuration supports:

- Multi-AZ node pools (with nodes in each AZ)
- Kubernetes network plugins (CNI) that support AZ-aware routing and failover
- Correct configuration of public/private subnets and associated route tables

Hybrid Manager components—including Postgres clusters—benefit from AZ-spread to improve availability.

## Manage Kubernetes Services types appropriately

Hybrid Manager uses Kubernetes Services to expose internal and external endpoints:

- ClusterIP Services are used for internal communication between platform components and databases.
- LoadBalancer Services expose public endpoints where needed (for example, UI/API access if configured).
- Ingress resources may be used depending on platform (e.g. OpenShift Routes, NGINX Ingress, ALB Ingress on EKS).

Best practices:

- Use ClusterIP Services for Postgres primary and replica Services.
- Use LoadBalancer or Ingress only where explicitly required for user or API access.
- Validate firewall rules and SecurityGroups align with expected exposure.

## Apply NetworkPolicies to control traffic

Kubernetes NetworkPolicies allow fine-grained control over Pod-to-Pod and Pod-to-external traffic.

Recommended patterns:

- Allow Hybrid Manager platform components to communicate with each other and with Postgres databases.
- Deny all unnecessary traffic by default; explicitly allow required traffic flows.
- Separate control plane and data plane traffic where applicable.

NetworkPolicies should be validated in all clusters used for Hybrid Manager to ensure consistent security posture.

## Configure DNS and service discovery

Hybrid Manager depends on Kubernetes DNS to resolve internal service endpoints.

Ensure that:

- Kubernetes CoreDNS or equivalent DNS service is deployed and healthy.
- Kubernetes DNS domain is configured consistently across environments.
- External DNS integrations (for LoadBalancer or Ingress endpoints) are configured with appropriate TTLs and monitored for updates.

## Optimize for database traffic

Managed Postgres clusters require stable, performant network paths:

- Prefer low-latency intra-cluster traffic for Postgres primary and replica communication.
- Avoid cross-AZ database replication traffic unless explicitly configured and validated.
- Monitor network latency and error rates between database Pods and consuming application Pods.

Postgres replication and HA performance is sensitive to network latency; validate networking setup accordingly.

## Monitor and validate networking health

Operational best practices:

- Monitor LoadBalancer and Ingress health and status.
- Monitor Service endpoints to ensure expected Pods are attached.
- Monitor DNS resolution times and error rates.
- Validate NetworkPolicy enforcement periodically using test Pods.
- Monitor key metrics such as network RTT, packet loss, and retransmits, especially for database traffic.

See [Monitoring Kubernetes clusters](../../how-to/monitor-kubernetes-cluster) and [Troubleshooting Kubernetes](../../how-to/troubleshooting-on-kubernetes) for additional guidance.

## Summary checklist

- Enable multi-AZ networking for availability.
- Use Service types appropriately (ClusterIP, LoadBalancer, Ingress).
- Apply NetworkPolicies to control traffic flows.
- Validate DNS and service discovery across environments.
- Optimize network paths for Postgres traffic.
- Monitor and validate networking health continuously.
