Hybrid Manager runs on Kubernetes, and effective troubleshooting of Kubernetes clusters is essential for diagnosing and resolving issues that impact Hybrid Manager components and EDB-managed Postgres services.

This page provides **troubleshooting best practices** and common patterns for investigating Kubernetes environments used with Hybrid Manager.
It complements the actionable [How to troubleshoot Kubernetes](/portal/kubernetes/learn/how-to/troubleshooting-on-kubernetes) guide, which provides specific commands and procedures.

For background on how Kubernetes is used in Hybrid Manager, see [Kubernetes in Hybrid Manager](../k8-in-hybrid-manager).

## Understand the layers involved

When troubleshooting Hybrid Manager on Kubernetes, be aware of the layered architecture:

- Cloud infrastructure layer (nodes, storage, networking)
- Kubernetes cluster layer (control plane, worker nodes, network policies, Services, Ingress)
- Hybrid Manager platform components (UI, API, operators, backup agents)
- Managed Postgres clusters (StatefulSets, PVCs, Services)
- External integrations (cloud storage, identity providers, observability stack)

Understanding where a failure occurs across these layers helps guide the troubleshooting process.

## Start with Kubernetes Events and Pod status

Most Hybrid Manager-related issues surface first in Kubernetes Pod status or Events.

Best practices:

- Check Pod status for all relevant namespaces, especially Hybrid Manager namespaces and Postgres namespaces.
- Review recent Kubernetes Events — they often reveal resource scheduling failures, volume mount errors, network policy issues, or image pull problems.
- Pay attention to Pods in Pending, CrashLoopBackOff, or Error states.

## Use layered troubleshooting

Troubleshooting should proceed in logical layers:

- **Infrastructure** → Node Ready status, node resource pressure, storage availability, network health
- **Control plane** → API server health, etcd health (if self-managed), controller logs
- **Workloads** → Hybrid Manager components and Postgres clusters → Pod status, Events, logs
- **Services** → Kubernetes Services and Ingress behavior, LoadBalancer status, DNS resolution
- **External integrations** → Storage access (IRSA, Workload Identity), IAM/IDP behavior, observability pipeline health

Following this layered flow reduces time spent chasing irrelevant causes.

## Validate storage first for stateful issues

Many issues affecting Postgres clusters or Hybrid Manager operators involve Kubernetes storage:

- PVC stuck Pending
- PVC full
- Volume mount errors
- Volume expansion failures
- Underlying cloud disk failures

Validate storage health and capacity early in any troubleshooting process involving databases.

## Validate networking for connectivity issues

Network misconfiguration is a common source of application errors:

- Validate Service endpoints and Pod readiness.
- Validate Ingress or LoadBalancer behavior.
- Validate DNS resolution inside the cluster.
- Validate NetworkPolicies are not overly restrictive.
- Check firewall rules and SecurityGroups for LoadBalancer services.

## Leverage observability stack

Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki provide key insights:

- Use dashboards to correlate resource usage spikes with incidents.
- Review component-level metrics and logs.
- Trace slow queries or network latency back to Kubernetes or infrastructure causes.

Observability data complements Kubernetes Events and CLI troubleshooting.

## Correlate Postgres behavior with Kubernetes signals

When troubleshooting database issues:

- Always cross-reference Postgres metrics and logs with Kubernetes Pod status and Events.
- Many Postgres behaviors (failover, replication lag, connection limits) can be impacted by Kubernetes-level issues like node pressure, network disruptions, or volume latency.

Use this correlation to avoid false root causes.

## Document and automate troubleshooting

Best practices:

- Maintain up-to-date runbooks for Hybrid Manager troubleshooting on Kubernetes.
- Automate routine checks and alert enrichment.
- Regularly review past incidents to identify recurring Kubernetes issues.

Automation and good documentation reduce mean time to resolution (MTTR) during production incidents.

## Summary checklist

- Understand layered troubleshooting model for Hybrid Manager on Kubernetes.
- Always start with Kubernetes Events and Pod status.
- Validate storage early for stateful workloads.
- Validate networking for connectivity and access issues.
- Leverage observability data alongside Kubernetes CLI troubleshooting.
- Correlate database behavior with Kubernetes signals.
- Maintain runbooks and automate common troubleshooting checks.
