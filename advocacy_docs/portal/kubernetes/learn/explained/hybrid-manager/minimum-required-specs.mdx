navTitle: Minimum and recommended specs
description: Understand minimum and recommended Kubernetes cluster specifications for running Hybrid Manager and supporting managed database services.
---

Hybrid Manager runs on Kubernetes and relies on it to provide a scalable, resilient platform for managing database services and platform components.
Choosing appropriate Kubernetes cluster specifications is critical for ensuring reliable performance and capacity when running Hybrid Manager.

This guide provides **minimum and recommended Kubernetes specs** specifically for supporting Hybrid Manager and EDB-managed Postgres database services.

> For background, see [Kubernetes in Hybrid Manager](/portal/kubernetes/learn/explained/k8s-in-hybrid-manager).

## Minimum supported Kubernetes version

Hybrid Manager requires a **certified Kubernetes distribution** (such as EKS, GKE, AKS, OpenShift, or upstream Kubernetes) that meets the following:

-   Kubernetes version: *Follow Hybrid Manager release notes for supported versions (typically N-1 or N-2 of current upstream).*
-   Control plane must support:
-   RBAC
-   NetworkPolicies (or equivalent)
-   CSI storage drivers
-   Ingress controller (ALB, Nginx, OpenShift Route, etc.)
-   Support for PodSecurityStandards or equivalent security controls

## Minimum node specs

| Node role                                                 | Minimum            | Recommended        |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------ |
| General node (Hybrid Manager UI, API services, operators) | 2 vCPU, 8 GiB RAM  | 4 vCPU, 16 GiB RAM |
| Database node (managed Postgres StatefulSets)             | 4 vCPU, 16 GiB RAM | 8 vCPU, 32 GiB RAM |

-   Database workloads benefit from higher memory and faster CPU.
-   Consider **storage throughput and IOPS** when sizing nodes — see [Kubernetes storage best practices](storage-best-practices/).
-   Use **multi-AZ node pools** where supported for availability.

## Recommended cluster sizing

| Cluster size              | Minimum nodes | Recommended nodes              |
| ------------------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Small test/dev cluster    | 3 nodes       | 3 nodes (multi-AZ if possible) |
| Small production cluster  | 3 nodes       | 4-6 nodes (multi-AZ)           |
| Medium production cluster | 6 nodes       | 8-12 nodes (multi-AZ)          |
| Large production cluster  | 12+ nodes     | Size based on workload demands |

Notes:

-   Hybrid Manager runs multiple platform components (UI, API, Operators, backup agents, observability stack).
-   Database Pods (StatefulSets) require **dedicated capacity** → avoid co-scheduling them on heavily loaded nodes.
-   Plan for **horizontal scaling** — it is better to start with conservative sizing and add node capacity as needed.

## Networking considerations

-   Plan for **cluster IP address space** large enough to accommodate:
-   Hybrid Manager services
-   Database services
-   Monitoring, logging components
-   Any additional workloads you deploy
-   Enable **multi-AZ networking** where supported (e.g. EKS VPC CNI, OpenShift SDN, GKE VPC-native).
-   Apply **NetworkPolicies** to control traffic as needed — see [Managing Kubernetes networking](./manage-kubernetes-networking).

## Storage considerations

-   Use **dedicated StorageClasses** for database PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs):
-   Volume type: SSD-backed block storage (e.g. gp3, io2 on AWS; pd-ssd on GCP; Azure Premium Disk)
-   VolumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer
-   Filesystem: ext4 or xfs
-   Plan for **volume expansion** → StorageClasses should support allowVolumeExpansion.

See detailed guidance in [Kubernetes storage best practices](storage-best-practices/).

## Summary recommendations

| Component          | Recommendation                                                    |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Kubernetes version | As per Hybrid Manager release notes (certified Kubernetes distro) |
| Nodes              | Multi-AZ, mixed node pools for DB vs. non-DB workloads            |
| Node sizing        | See table above; prioritize memory and IOPS for DB nodes          |
| Networking         | Multi-AZ support, NetworkPolicies in place                        |
| Storage            | SSD-backed block storage, expansion-capable StorageClasses        |
