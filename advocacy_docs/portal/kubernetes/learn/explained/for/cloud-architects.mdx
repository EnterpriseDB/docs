Kubernetes is a foundational building block for modern cloud-native architectures. As a cloud architect, you use Kubernetes to design systems that are scalable, portable, resilient, and aligned with cloud best practices.

This page explains how Kubernetes fits into the work of cloud architects and highlights common patterns, tools, and best practices.

## Why cloud architects use Kubernetes

Cloud architects use Kubernetes to:

- Enable consistent application platforms across cloud providers and hybrid environments
- Design scalable systems with automated recovery and resilience
- Support cloud portability and avoid vendor lock-in at the infrastructure level
- Provide a declarative, API-driven architecture for managing infrastructure and services
- Integrate Kubernetes with cloud-native services (networking, storage, identity, security)
- Support DevOps, GitOps, and CI/CD patterns for modern delivery pipelines
- Guide platform engineering and application teams toward architecture best practices

## What cloud architects manage in Kubernetes

As a cloud architect, you typically:

- Define Kubernetes architecture patterns (single cluster, multi-cluster, multi-region)
- Design cluster topology (node pools, Availability Zones, networking)
- Select Kubernetes distributions and manage cloud-specific tradeoffs
- Guide the design of Service Mesh, Ingress, and API Gateway patterns
- Define storage strategies (CSI drivers, performance tiers, backup/recovery)
- Integrate Kubernetes with cloud-native identity and access management
- Design observability pipelines (metrics, logs, traces) for platform and applications
- Collaborate on resource management and cost optimization practices
- Define organizational standards and best practices for Kubernetes architecture

## Common tools for cloud architects

- **Terraform / Pulumi**: Define Kubernetes clusters and supporting cloud infrastructure as code
- **Helm**: Manage reusable Kubernetes application charts
- **ArgoCD / Flux**: Implement GitOps-driven deployment workflows
- **Istio / Linkerd / Service Mesh Interface**: Design and manage service mesh for traffic control and security
- **Prometheus / Grafana / Loki**: Implement observability pipelines
- **Velero**: Manage backup and disaster recovery strategies
- **Crossplane**: Manage cloud infrastructure as Kubernetes resources
- **Cloud provider-native tools** (AWS EKS, GKE, AKS, OpenShift): Design around distribution-specific features and limitations

## Common questions cloud architects ask

- What Kubernetes architecture patterns best support our application and business goals?
- How should we manage multi-cluster and multi-region Kubernetes environments?
- How do we design Kubernetes networks to balance performance, security, and cost?
- How do we integrate Kubernetes with cloud-native identity and security services?
- How do we support reliable backup, restore, and disaster recovery for Kubernetes workloads?
- How do we design Kubernetes to support GitOps workflows and platform automation?
- How can we enable observability across applications and platform layers in Kubernetes?
- What tradeoffs do different Kubernetes distributions present?
- How do we ensure Kubernetes architecture aligns with cloud cost optimization goals?

## Best practices for cloud architects

- Design for resilience and availability across Availability Zones and regions
- Use declarative, API-driven management for both Kubernetes and cloud infrastructure
- Integrate cloud-native services where they add value, while preserving portability when needed
- Define standard architecture patterns for network, storage, and identity integration
- Support multi-cluster and multi-region patterns wher
