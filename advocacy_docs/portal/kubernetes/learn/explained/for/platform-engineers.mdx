As a platform engineer, you are responsible for designing, managing, and evolving the infrastructure that supports modern applications. Kubernetes plays a central role in this stack, providing a consistent and extensible platform for running containerized workloads.

This page explains how Kubernetes fits into the work of platform engineers and highlights common patterns, tools, and best practices.

## Why platform engineers use Kubernetes

Kubernetes helps platform engineers:

-   Provide a consistent application runtime across environments (on-premises, hybrid, multi-cloud)
-   Automate deployment and management of containerized workloads
-   Manage infrastructure as code through declarative APIs and GitOps practices
-   Enable self-service deployment models for developers
-   Support scalability and high availability for critical workloads
-   Integrate observability, security, and cost management into the platform

## What platform engineers manage in Kubernetes

As a platform engineer, you typically manage:

-   Kubernetes cluster lifecycle (provisioning, upgrades, scaling)
-   Node pools and infrastructure (compute, storage, networking)
-   Core platform services (Ingress, service mesh, monitoring, logging)
-   Storage integration (CSI drivers, StorageClasses)
-   Identity and access management (RBAC, cloud identity integration)
-   Network policies and Pod security standards
-   Backup and disaster recovery tooling
-   Cost optimization and cluster resource tuning

You also provide tooling and workflows that enable application teams to deploy and manage their workloads on Kubernetes.

## Common tools for platform engineers

-   **kubectl**: Core CLI for interacting with the cluster
-   **kustomize / Helm**: Manage Kubernetes manifests and releases
-   **Flux / ArgoCD**: Implement GitOps pipelines
-   **Prometheus / Grafana / Loki**: Observability stack for monitoring and logging
-   **Istio / Linkerd**: Service mesh for advanced networking and security
-   **Velero**: Backup and disaster recovery for Kubernetes resources and persistent volumes
-   **Cluster API** (CAPI): Declarative cluster lifecycle management
-   **Infrastructure as Code** (Terraform, Pulumi): Automate cloud infrastructure for Kubernetes clusters

## Common questions platform engineers ask

-   How do I provision and scale Kubernetes clusters securely?
-   How do I provide a good developer experience for application teams on Kubernetes?
-   How can I implement GitOps for Kubernetes resource management?
-   How can I monitor, alert, and troubleshoot Kubernetes workloads?
-   How can I manage cost and optimize resource usage across clusters?
-   How do I enforce network and security policies at the Kubernetes level?
-   How do I manage multi-cluster environments?

## Best practices for platform engineers

-   Automate cluster lifecycle and configuration as much as possible
-   Implement GitOps workflows for all cluster resources
-   Use observability tools to provide visibility into cluster and application health
-   Define standard, opinionated configurations for Ingress, StorageClasses, NetworkPolicies, and SecurityContexts
-   Regularly test and validate cluster upgrades in non-production environments
-   Design for multi-AZ high availability when supported by your cloud provider
-   Build clear documentation and self-service portals for developers consuming your Kubernetes platform
