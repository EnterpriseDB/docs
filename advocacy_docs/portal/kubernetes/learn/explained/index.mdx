description: Understand what Kubernetes is, why it is part of the EDB Platform architecture, and how different roles interact with it in cloud-native environments.

Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It has become the de facto standard for running modern cloud-native workloads across diverse environments—whether in public cloud, private cloud, on-premises data centers, or hybrid environments.

Kubernetes is a foundational technology used in the EDB Platform architecture.
While EDB does not sell Kubernetes itself, we rely on it to provide a consistent, resilient, and portable foundation for running core services, including Hybrid Manager and EDB-managed Postgres database services.
Kubernetes enables EDB to support flexible deployment models, allowing customers to run our platform in the cloud, on-premises, or across hybrid environments based on their needs.

This section of the documentation is provided to help you understand the core Kubernetes concepts and patterns that EDB’s platform builds upon.
It is not intended as a Kubernetes sales pitch, but as a helpful reference for understanding how Kubernetes is used under the hood—and what that means for how you operate and interact with EDB Platform services.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes helps you:

-   **Run and manage containers** at scale across multiple servers (Nodes)
-   **Automate deployment and scaling** of applications
-   **Maintain availability and recover from failures**
-   **Abstract infrastructure details** so workloads can run consistently across environments
-   **Integrate with cloud-native tools** for networking, monitoring, storage, and security

Kubernetes does this by letting you describe your desired system state through APIs and configuration files (YAML), and then actively manages that state for you.

## Why use Kubernetes?

Organizations adopt Kubernetes to:

-   **Increase automation** and reduce operational overhead
-   **Support DevOps and GitOps workflows**
-   **Improve resiliency and availability of applications**
-   **Enable portability across clouds and hybrid environments**
-   **Leverage the rich Kubernetes ecosystem of tools and extensions**

For EDB and our customers, Kubernetes enables Hybrid Manager to deliver scalable, cloud-agnostic services while supporting flexible deployment models.
Customers can run Hybrid Manager and EDB Postgres database services entirely on public cloud Kubernetes services (EKS, GKE, AKS), on-premises Kubernetes clusters, or across hybrid environments that blend both.

## Kubernetes and common roles

Different roles interact with Kubernetes in different ways. Understanding what Kubernetes offers for each role helps teams collaborate more effectively.

| Role                                                     | Typical interaction with Kubernetes                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Decision makers](./for/decision-makers)                 | Evaluate Kubernetes as part of platform strategy, assess TCO, align adoption with business outcomes                   |
| [Platform engineers](./for/platform-engineers)           | Design and manage Kubernetes clusters, automate CI/CD, integrate observability and security tools                     |
| [Software engineers](./for/software-engineers)           | Deploy applications to Kubernetes, define application configurations, manage scaling and observability                |
| [DBAs](./for/dbas)                                       | Manage database services on Kubernetes, monitor resource usage and storage, tune performance and backups              |
| [Site reliability engineers (SREs)](./for/sres)          | Observe cluster and application health, manage availability and capacity, automate recovery processes                 |
| [Security engineers](./for/security-engineers)           | Define access controls, enforce network and security policies, monitor security posture of Kubernetes workloads       |
| [Cloud architects](./for/cloud-architects)               | Design scalable, portable architectures leveraging Kubernetes, align Kubernetes use with cloud and hybrid strategy    |
| [Operations and support teams](./for/operations-support) | Monitor system state, respond to alerts, investigate issues using Kubernetes-native tools and observability pipelines |

## How Kubernetes fits into cloud-native platforms

Kubernetes is often part of a larger cloud-native platform stack.
By providing a consistent orchestration layer, it enables EDB and other organizations to build scalable, reliable platforms that integrate with modern cloud services and tooling.

Typical components in a Kubernetes-based stack include:

-   **GitOps-based deployment pipelines**
    Declarative, version-controlled application and platform configuration.

-   **Observability stacks**
    Metrics: Prometheus
    Dashboards: Grafana
    Logs: Loki or Fluent Bit
    Traces: OpenTelemetry

-   **Service mesh and advanced networking**
    Istio, Linkerd, or other service mesh technologies to provide fine-grained control over traffic flow and security.

-   **Cloud-native storage**
    CSI drivers and dynamic provisioning for block and file storage across Kubernetes environments.

-   **Secure workload management**
    RBAC, NetworkPolicies, PodSecurityStandards to enforce security controls across workloads.

In the EDB Platform, Kubernetes enables these patterns and provides the orchestration layer for Hybrid Manager’s core services—including UI, API services, Operators, database clusters, observability tooling, and backup/restore pipelines.
