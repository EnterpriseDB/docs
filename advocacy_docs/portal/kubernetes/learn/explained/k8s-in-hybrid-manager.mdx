---

Hybrid Manager uses Kubernetes as a foundational platform to orchestrate and manage many of its core services.

By running on Kubernetes, Hybrid Manager gains:

- Scalable and resilient deployment of control plane services
- Declarative configuration and lifecycle management of Hybrid Manager components
- Integration with cloud-native services across multiple cloud providers
- Consistent operational patterns for monitoring, logging, and backup
- Support for modern DevOps and GitOps workflows

## Key benefits

- **Portability**: Hybrid Manager can be deployed across multiple Kubernetes distributions (EKS, AKS, GKE, OpenShift, self-managed).
- **Resiliency**: Kubernetes enables automated recovery and scaling of critical Hybrid Manager services.
- **Observability**: Kubernetes-native monitoring and logging provide deep visibility into Hybrid Manager operations.
- **Automation**: Hybrid Manager leverages Kubernetes APIs for lifecycle automation of both platform services and managed databases.

## Kubernetes-managed components in Hybrid Manager

- Hybrid Manager core services (UI, API, Operators)
- Managed Postgres clusters (via Kubernetes operators)
- Backup and restore tooling
- Monitoring and observability stack
- Logging and telemetry pipelines
- Secure configuration and secret management
