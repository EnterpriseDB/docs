---

This page provides key Kubernetes terms and platform-specific concepts that are commonly used when running Kubernetes-based workloads. While some of these concepts are universal, others are specific to certain cloud providers or Kubernetes distributions.

## Universal Kubernetes concepts

These concepts apply to most Kubernetes distributions.

### Cluster

Primary control unit managing worker nodes and applications. Includes the control plane and data plane.

### Node

A worker machine (physical or virtual) where Pods run.

### Pod

The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes, consisting of one or more containers.

### Container

A lightweight package containing application code and dependencies.

### Service

Provides stable IP/DNS access to a set of Pods.

### Deployment

Manages stateless application Pods, ensuring availability and handling updates.

### StatefulSet

Manages stateful applications with stable identities and persistent storage.

### PersistentVolume (PV)

A piece of storage in the cluster provisioned manually or dynamically.

### PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC)

A request for storage made by an application.

### StorageClass

Defines storage classes used for dynamic volume provisioning.

### Container Storage Interface (CSI)

A standard API allowing storage vendors to create plugins for Kubernetes.

### ConfigMap

Stores non-confidential configuration data for applications.

### Secret

Stores sensitive data such as passwords or keys.

### Namespace

Partitions cluster resources into logical groups.

### Ingress

Manages external HTTP(S) access to Services.

### kubectl

Primary CLI tool for interacting with the Kubernetes API server.

## Platform-specific concepts and implementations

### AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)

**Managed Control Plane**
AWS manages the Kubernetes control plane.

**Managed Node Groups**
AWS manages lifecycle of worker nodes.

**VPC CNI (Container Network Interface)**
Assigns VPC IPs directly to Pods.

**IAM Roles for Service Accounts (IRSA)**
Allows Pods to access AWS services securely via IAM roles.

**EBS CSI Driver**
Manages AWS EBS volumes.

**AWS Load Balancer Controller (LBC)**
Provisions AWS ALBs and NLBs for external access.

### Red Hat OpenShift (RHOS)

**Security Context Constraints (SCCs)**
Controls Pod security settings.

**Routes**
Provides external HTTP(S) access, similar to Ingress.

**OpenShift Storage (e.g., ODF/Ceph)**
Storage options integrated with OpenShift.

**Service Accounts & Permissions**
Manages Kubernetes Service Accounts and their access permissions.

### Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)

**Workload Identity**
Allows Kubernetes Service Accounts to impersonate Google Cloud Service Accounts.

**Persistent Disk CSI Driver**
Manages GCE Persistent Disks.

**GKE Ingress / Cloud Load Balancers**
Provides external HTTP(S) access using Google Cloud Load Balancers.

### Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)

**Workload Identity / Pod Identity**
Allows Kubernetes Service Accounts to use Azure AD identities.

**Azure Disk / Azure File CSI Drivers**
Manages Azure Disk and Azure File storage.

**AKS Ingress**
Options include AGIC and Nginx-based Ingress controllers.

## Other terms

**VPC**
Virtual Private Cloud â€” defines the network environment for Kubernetes.

**Egress**
Outbound network traffic from the cluster.

**Ingress**
Inbound network traffic to the cluster.
