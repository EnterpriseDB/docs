---

This section shows following VisionX usage scenarios with EDB Postgres Advanced Server and EDB Postgres Extended Server.

1. FMB-based migration of an Oracle Forms application to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server / VisionX Low Code application
  - Part 1: FMB based application migration
  - Part 2: Oracle database to EDB Postgres Advanced Server migration
  - Part 3: Switch database connection to EDB Postgres Advanced Server
2. Data model-based migration of an Oracle Forms / APEX application to an EDB Postgres / VisionX Low Code application
  - Part 1: Data model based application migration
  - Part 2: Oracle database to EDB Postgres Advanced Server migration
  - Part 3: Switch database connection to EDB Postgres Advanced Server
3. Create a VisionX application that uses an EDB Postgres Advanced Server / EDB Postgres Extended instance as a data source
  - Create a screen that connects to an existing table from an EDB Postgres Advanced Server / EDB Postgres Extended instance
  - Create a screen that creates a table in the connected EDB Postgres Advanced Server / EDB Postgres Extended instance

## FMB-based migration of an Oracle Forms application to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server / VisionX Low Code application

This example shows how an Oracle Forms application is migrated to a VisionX low-code application using an FMB file (Oracle Forms source file). The first step is to migrate the application. In the second step, the Oracle database is migrated to EDB Postgres Advanced Server/EDB Postgres Extended Server using the usual tools such as EDBs MTK.
Then the migrated application is connected to EDB Postgres Advanced Server/EDB Postgres Extended Server.

### FMB based application migration

1. Open VisionX and create an application. The "Create a new Application" screen will then be opened.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration1.png">
</p>

2. At the “Choose Database” step, select “New Database User”. The default settings create a new database user in the Postgres database bundled with VisionX. Alternatively, an EDB / EDB Postgres Advanced Server/EDB Postgres Extended Server can be used here. The database user is used to create the tables for the migrated application’s standard VisionX user management. This is used instead of the Oracle Forms user management. Optionally, other authentication systems such as Windows AD or Open ID system can easily be integrated.

</p>

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration3.png">
</p>

3. At the “Create Admin User” step, provide the user name and password and click “Finish”.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration4.png">
</p>

4. A Task List screen will display the Application creation progress.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration5.png">
</p>

5. Once the application is created, the “New Application Screen” is opened, which allows the user to create a screen.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration6.png">
</p>

6. At the “Creation Mode” step, choose “Import an Oracle Forms (.fmb) module”.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration7.png">
</p>

7. At the next step (“Choose Database”), select “Existing Database User” and provide the credentials to the Oracle Database used by Oracle Forms.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration8.png">
</p>

8. At the “Choose Module” step, select the FMB file.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration9.png">
</p>

   In this example, VisionX analyzes the orders.fmb file and shows all included windows/canvases for the selection.
   The following screen shot shows the orders.fmb file in Oracle Forms Builder.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration10.png">
</p>

9. After the .fmb files is selected, a Task List screen displays the Oracle Forms migration progress.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration11.png">
</p>

   After the migrated screen is created, it is displayed in Design Mode in VisionX, where the user can adjust it according to the requirements.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration12.png">
</p>

   The VisionX Oracle Forms Migration Extension can migrate FMBs semi-automatically. All user interface elements (Windows/Canvas/Items) and the Oracle Forms Persistence (Blocks) can be migrated automatically. In a manual step, the Oracle Forms application logic (PL/SQL) is compiled into the database. The remaining UI Logic is then created in VisionX visually or manually with Java Code.

#### Add logic visually with actions in VisionX

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration13.png">
</p>

#### Modify or add any Java code using Eclipse

1. Import the application in Eclipse by clicking shift+alt in the VisionX main view and clicking the icon next to the application.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration14.png">
</p>

2. Select an UI element in VisionX and click the purple Eclipse button.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration15.png">
</p>

3. Eclipse navigates to the relevant Java Code. 

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration16.png">
</p>

4. Change the “Order Information” label in Eclipse.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration17.png">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration18.png">
</p>

   If you change the code outside of VisionX in Eclipse, the changes are pushed back into the VisionX visual development environment in real time! This enables 100% unlimited app development for Citizen Developers / Business Users and Pro Developers.

10. Open the screen in the VisionX Live Preview and change some of the data. The data will be updated in the Oracle Database.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration19.png">
</p>

### Oracle database to EDB Postgres Advanced Server migration

In the second step, the Oracle database is migrated to EDB Postgres Advanced Server/EDB Postgres Extended Server using the EDB's MTK migration tool.

The migration steps in connection with an Oracle Forms migration are not different from a pure Oracle to EDB database migration. Therefore, we do not discuss this topic in detail here.  Links to MTK

Refer to the [MTK documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_toolkit/latest/)

### Switch database connection to EDB Postgres Advanced Server

Switching from the Oracle database is a simple step in VisionX. In the migrated VisionX application, simply click on the VisionX Settings screen and choose the “Datasources” tab. Click “Edit” to change the database connection from Oracle to PostgresSQL.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration20.png">
</p>

## Data model-based migration of an Oracle Forms / APEX application to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server / VisionX Low Code application

This example shows how an Oracle Forms / APEX application is migrated to a VisionX low-code application using the existing data model. The first step is to migrate the application. In the second step, the Oracle database is migrated to EDB Postgres Advanced Server/EDB Postgres Extended using the usual tools such as EDBs MTK.

Then the migrated application is connected to EDB Postgres Advanced Server/EDB Postgres Extended Server.

### Data model based application migration

Steps 1 to 5 are the same as for an FMB-based application migration.

6. At the “Screen Infos” step, provide the required information for the screen.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration21.png">
</p>

7. At the ”Choose Layout” step, select the required layout for the screen.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration22.png">
</p>

8. At the next step (“Select Data Source”), select the “Use existing data from database tables” option, which allows the user to select the tables used in the original Oracle Forms / APEX screen. The screen will be migrated based on these tables.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration23.png">
</p>

9. At the “Choose Database” step, provide the connection information for the Oracle database that is used in the Oracle Forms / APEX application.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration24.png">
</p>

10. On the next screen, select the tables used in the original Oracle Forms / APEX screen. The screen will be migrated based on these tables. 

   Much of the typically manually created logic in Oracle Forms and APEX is automatically recognized in VisionX. All drop-down lists are recognized based on the Foreign Keys to the master data. If these are missing, they can be defined manually in VisionX. Furthermore, all relevant detail tables are offered for each master table. This makes it very easy to define the master detail relations in the screen.  We have selected the appropriate layout of the screen in the previous step. This layout can be changed in the in the UI Designer later.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration25.png">
</p>

   We choose s_Ord in this example because it is the master table of the Oracle Forms screen

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration26.png">
</p>

   The dropdown lists to S_Customer, A_Payment Type and S_Emp for the sales rep of the order are detected automatically.

   In the next step, we click on “More” and add the Master/Detail relationship to the S_Item table.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration27.png">
</p>

11. Once the screen is created, it will be displayed in Design Mode where the user can adjust it according to the requirements.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration28.png">
</p>

   To get the image for each product as in the original Oracle Form, we add the product table in the lower area using the "New Table" tab. Here we use the same steps as for the selection of the S_Ord table, except that we select the S_Product table instead. We choose S_Product because it is a detail to the S_Item table.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration29.png">
</p>

   Repeat the same for the S_Image table, because S_Image is a detail to the S_Product table.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration30.png">
</p>

   We then define the “Image” column as “Image” datatype by clicking on the datatype dropdown, so we can later position it on the screen as an image.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration31.png">
</p>

   Now we connect the S_Product table as a detail to the S_Item table. To do this, we select the S_Product table at the bottom of the editor and click on the “Edit” icon. Then we click on “More” and select the S_Item as Master Table.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration32.png">
</p>

   Repeat the same for the S_Image table, because S_Image is a detail to the S_Product.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration33.png">
</p>

   Select the screen’s detail area by clicking “Details” on the orange bar at the top of the “Orders” screen. Then select the S_Image table in the lower area and position the image editor on the top right corner of the screen using drag & drop.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration34.png">
</p>

12. Open the screen in the Live Preview. With a few steps we created the Oracle Forms screen in VisionX based on the current data model. We even created an additional list view with a search function.

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration35.png">
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img  alt="Create a new Application" src="Images/FMBMigration36.png">
</p>

### Oracle database to EDB Postgres Advanced Server migration

In the second step, the Oracle database is migrated to EDB Postgres Advanced Server/EDB Postgres Extended Server using the EDBs MTK migration tool.

The migration steps in connection with an Oracle Forms migration are not different from a pure Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server database migration. Therefore, we do not discuss this topic in detail here.  Links to MTK.

Refer to the [MTK documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_toolkit/latest/)

### Switch database connection to EDB Postgres

Switching from Oracle is a simple step in VisionX. In the migrated VisionX application, simply click on the VisionX Settings screen and choose the “Datasources” tab. Click on “Edit” to change the database connection from Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server.
