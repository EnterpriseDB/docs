### FSBasedBackupSet Backup and Restore

At this time there is a known issue with FSBased Restore that does not allow for proper restoration of the database. See the known issues section of the guide for more information.

#### Known Issues:
1. FSBaseBadkupSet Restore has an issue if the *:\Program files\edb has been deleted, after the restore is done, the permissions on the restored directories are not recovered, and it instead inherits the permissions from the parent directory which does not allow EDB Postgres Advanced Server services to start on the restored directory. We are working with Commvault to resolve the issue.
