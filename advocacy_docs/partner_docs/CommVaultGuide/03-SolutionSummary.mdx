Commvault enables your business to streamline management of its continuously evolving data environment, whether the data is on-premises or in the cloud.

Commvault PostgreSQL iDataAgent provides the flexibility to backup PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Advanced Server and EDB Postgres Extended Server databases in different modes and restore them when needed. You can perform a full/log backup or restore of database servers/individual databases/archive logs at any time and have full control over the process.

Managing your data means knowing that it is protected and being able to effectively report on success or failure.  Through an easy-to-use interface, you can quickly check on the progress of your jobs to ensure things are moving as expected.  You can also use pre-built reports in an on-demand fashion, or scheduled, to keep you in the know.
