Implementing Commvault Backup & Recovery with EDB Postgres Advanced Server requires the following components:

- EDB Postgres Advanced Server
- Commvault Backup & Recovery software

## Prerequisites

- A running EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance.
- Commvault Backup & Recovery installed.
- EDB Postgres Advanced Server application path and library directory path (e.g. c:\Program Files\edb\as13\bin and c:\Program Files\edb\as13\lib).
- The login credentials used to access the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database.
- EDB Postgres Advanced Server archive log directory configured.
