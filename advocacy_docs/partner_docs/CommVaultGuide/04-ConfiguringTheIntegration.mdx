Implementing Commvault Express with EDB Postgres Advanced Server requires the following components:

- EDB Postgres Advanced Server
- Commvault Express software

## Prerequisites

- A running EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) instance.
- Commvault Express installed.
- Obtain the EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) application path and library directory path.
- Obtain the credentials that are used to access the EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).
- Configure the EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) archive log directory.

## Configure Commvault Express for EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS)
