Implementing Commvault Backup & Recovery with an EDB database requires the following components:

- EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server
- Commvault Backup & Recovery software

## Prerequisites

- A running EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server instance.
- Commvault Backup & Recovery installed.
- EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server application path and library directory path (e.g. `c:\Program Files\edb\as13\bin` and `c:\Program Files\edb\as13\lib`).
- The login credentials used to access the EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server database.
- EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server archive log directory configured.

## Configure Commvault Backup & Recovery for EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server

### Setup a Disk Storage Pool and Database Server Backup Plan
1. Run the Core Setup Wizard from Commvault Backup & Recovery's Command Center from the Machine where Commvault Backup & Recovery is installed. The wizard helps to set up a disk storage pool and to modify the server backup plan according to your requirements.
2. Setup Storage Pool/Disk Storage: From the Welcome page, click `Let's get started`. On the `Disk` tab, in the `Name` box, enter a name for the storage pool.
3. In the `MediaAgent` box, accept the default value.
4. Click `Local` on the radio button for `Type`.
5. In the `Backup` location box, click `Browse` to assign a path where backups will be stored.
6. To enable deduplication on the storage, move the `Use` deduplication toggle key to the right, and in the `Deduplication DB` location box, browse to select the path to  the deduplication database.
7. To move to the next setup option, click `Save`.

8. Creating a Server Backup Plan in Core Setup: In order to create a server backup plan in Core Setup, define where the data is stored and how often must the data undergo a backup.
9. In the `Plan` name box,type the name of the plan e.g. `EPAS Server Plan`.
10. In the `Backup destinations` section, select the Storage and Retention Period.
11. In the `RPO` section, select the Backup frequency and Start time for the backup to start as per the backup frequency.

### Install a client on an EDB database
1. From the `Navigation` pane of the Commvault Backup & Recovery's Command Center, go to `Protect > Databases`.
2. Click `Add server`.
3. Select the database type for EDB database, which in this case is PostgreSQL.

4. In the `Database` server name box, enter the server name.
5. In the `Username` and `Password` boxes, enter the credentials to connect to the server.
6. From the Plan list, select the server plan created in step 8 under Setup a Disk Storage Pool and Database Server Backup Plan section for use with your EDB database.

7. Once the server is added, a Job will run to install a client on the Server. The screen shots below display the process from Job creation to software installation.

### Configure the EDB Database Instances to backup and protect
1. From the navigation pane, go to `Protect > Databases > DB Instances`.
2. Click `Add instance`, and then select `PostgreSQL`.

3. From the Server name list, select a server where you want to create the new instance.
4. In the `Instance Name` box, type the EDB database instance name.
5. From the `Plan` list, select the server plan created in step 8 under Setup a Disk Storage Pool and Database Server Backup Plan section for use with your EDB database.
6. Under `Connection details`, enter the following information.
   - In the `Database` user box, type the user name to access the EDB database instance.
   - In the `Password` box, type the EDB database user account password.
   - In the `Port` box, type the port to open the communication between the EDB database and the clients.
   - In the `Maintenance DB` box, type the name of a system database which is used as a maintenance database.
   - In the `PostgreSQL` section, enter paths for `Binary Directory`, `Lib Directory` and `Archive Log Directory`.
