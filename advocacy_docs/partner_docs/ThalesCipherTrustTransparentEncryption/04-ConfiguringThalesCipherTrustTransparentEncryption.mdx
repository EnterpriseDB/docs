The following diagram shows the basic flow of the CTE solution.

## Prerequisites

Implementing the CipherTrust Transparent Encryption (CTE) solution requires the following components:

  - Postgres server installed and operational
  - CipherTrust Manager installed and operational
  - A CTE agent installed on the Postgres host registered to the CipherTrust Manager

### Postgres host

- Make sure that the Postgres server is installed and running.

- For CentOS 7, you need to install the following repository:

```bash
sudo yum install -y lsof
```

### CipherTrust Manager

Make sure that CipherTrust Manager is installed and running.

## Configuring CipherTrust Manager

Log in to the CipherTrust Manager (CM) web UI. Then:

1. Create a registration token.

  1. Navigate to **Key and Access Management** and select **Registration Tokens**. This token is used for the CTE agent enrollment to CM. 

  1. To create a registration token, select **New Registration Token**. 

  The screenshot shows a registration token created with the name **edb**.

2. Create user sets.

  1. Navigate to **CTE** and select **Policies > Policy Elements > User Sets**. 

  1. To create the user set, select **Create User Set**. 
    
  1. Create the Postgres, EnterpriseDB, and Barman user sets as shown in the following screenshots.

3. Create the policies. Navigate back to **Policies** and select **Create Policy**.

The following screenshots show the live data transformation (LDT) policies postgres-policy, epas-policy, and barman-policy.

!!! Note
    The policies include the user sets Postgres and EnterpriseDB created in Step 2 and the same key rule for the policies:

### Installing CTE agent

Refer to the following guides from Thales for installing the CTE agent on the Postgres host:

- [CTE Agent Quick Start Guide](https://thalesdocs.com/ctp/cte/Books/Online-Files/7.0.0/CTE_Agent_Linux_Quick_Start_Guide_v7.0.0_Doc_v1.pdf)

- [CTE Agent Advanced Installation Guide](https://thalesdocs.com/ctp/cte/Books/Online-Files/7.0.0/CTE_Agent_Linux_Adv_Config_Integration_Guide_v7.0.0_Doc_v6.pdf)

!!! Note
    You need the registration token and host address of the CipherTrust Manager during the installation.

After the CTE agent is successfully installed, verify the Postgres host is registered with CM.
1. Log in to the CM web UI and navigate to **CTE**.
2. Select **Clients**. The client status appears as Healthy. (You might have to wait a few seconds for the status to update).

The screenshot shows clients registered with the CipherTrust Manager.
