## Prerequisites

!!! Note
     We refer to the EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Extended Server, and PostgreSQL Server products as the Postgres distribution. The specific distribution type depends on your needs and preferences.

Implementing Precisely Connect CDC with EDB Postgres Advanced Server requires the following components:

- Precisely supported source and target systems. The source, target, or both can be your Postgres distributions. The example uses EDB Postgres Advanced Server for both the source and target database.
- Precisely Connect CDC software.
- PostgreSQL management tool, such as pgAdmin or Postgres Enterprise Manager. The example uses pgAdmin to verify that the data is being replicated as expected.

## Configuring your PostgreSQL distribution

You need these components before integrating you PostgreSQL distribution with Precisely Connect CDC:

- Two running instances of EDB Postgres Advanced Server

- pgAdmin installed on the source and target EDB Postgres Advanced Server instances

- A running instance of Precisely Connect CDC

## Enable WAL archiving

Enable WAL archiving on the source EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance. WAL archiving is required for Precisely Connect CDC’s replication functionality.

1. Go to the installation directory of EDB Postgres Advanced Server, for example, `C:\Program Files\edb\as14\`.

2. In the data directory, open the `postgresql.conf` file.

3. Modify the following settings as per the given values.

```yaml
archive_mode = on
wal_level = logical
archive_command = 'copy "%p" "C:\\archive_wal_directory\\%f"'    
max_replication_slots = 20

```

4. Restart the EDB Postgres Advanced Server Source instance.

!!! Note
     Configuration, such as WAL archiving, isn't required on the target EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance.
