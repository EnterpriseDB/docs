5. Right-click **Enterprise Data Movement Model**, and select **Validate** to validate the model.

6. Right-click **Enterprise Data Movement Model**, and select  **Commit > Full**.

7. To create the model files, on the Commit Model screen, select **OK**.

## Execute replication using Connect CDC MonCon

Replication distribution replicates all the changes done on the source tables to the target tables.

1. Open Connect CDC MonCon.

2. As the model is updated in the Connect CDC Director, to add the Replication Distribution, select **Model Update**. This adds the replication distribution to the Connect CDC MonCon interface.

3. After the model updates successfully, the replication request is displayed.

4. In the **Request** section, select the distribution model created for replication. Right-click, and select **Start**.

![Distribution model](Images/distrmodel.png)

5. On the source instance, update the data to be replicated in the source tables.

6. On the target instance, check data in the target tables. The data is updated there.

## Data transformation

Precisely Connect CDC has options that let you modify the source data you're distributing or even create or derive the data you distribute. You can use predefined functions to accomplish these data transformations, or you can construct your own operations or functions.

For example, to express source currency values in terms of a different currency, you specify the transformation algorithm to use for that column mapping. For some common transformations, the algorithm is supplied as a predefined Connect CDC function.

The algorithms you specify are known in the Connect CDC Director as *expressions*. The Connect CDC Expression Handler parses them and then creates runtime code that calculates the result for the expressions.

In addition to or instead of calls to predefined functions, expressions can have an arbitrary number of constants, column references, and calculations on those constants, columns, and functions. Their results must be compatible  with the target column in type and length.

### Steps to demonstrate data transformations

To demonstrate data transformations:

1. Open Connect CDC Director.

2. Go to **Source DBMS Server > Tables > Sending Tables**.

3. Using the check boxes, select the tables to perform data transformation. Right-click, and select **Properties > Mapping**.

4. On the **Mapping** tab, you define the column mappings for each of your target tables with respect to the source tables. The **Mapping** tab displays the corresponding columns in the **Target Column** and **Source Data** columns in each row. Connect CDC Director maps target columns to source columns that have the same name.

  When the Connect CDC Director maps a source table to a same-named target table, it also associates individual source table columns with same-named target table columns. You then select:

  - The column pairings you want to include in your data distribution
  - The additional column pairings you want to arrange
  - The type of data transformation, if any, you want to assign to each column pairing

  The **Mapping** tab has the following options:

  - **Receiving server list**: The name of the target server is displayed.
  - **Receiving table list**: The name of the target table is displayed. If it doesn't, for example, because its name doesn't match your source table’s, select the target table from the **Receiving table** list. The list includes all tables in the list of available tables for the target server. Any table name with [M]preceding it is already mapped to a source table.
    
  The **Mapping** tab grid displays each target table column and its datatype as well as its default corresponding source column, if any. Copy column under Method in the grid means the source column value is to be distributed without any special handling or transformation.

  - **Target** column: Contains all the columns in the target table.
  - **Datatype**: Datatype of the column for both source and target tables as per the mapping defined between source and target table.
  - **Source Data**: Contains all the columns in the source table.
  - **DKey**: Identifies the distribution key. By default, **DKey** is marked for the primary key. You can clear the default and add as many check marks as necessary.
  - **Method**: Contains a list of data transformation functions.

5. For this example, from the **Method** list for the target column `loc`, select lower case. This data transformation converts the data in the `loc` column of the target table to lower case after the replication is done.

![Data Transformation](Images/datatransformation1.png)

6. Perform the replication from Connect CDC MonCon.

7. On the target instance, check the data in the target table `dept`. `data` is transformed for the column `loc` and is stored as lower case.
