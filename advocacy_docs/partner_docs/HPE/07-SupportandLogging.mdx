## Support

Both EDB and HPE provide technical support for the use of these products. To get support, you must have a support contract in place at both EDB and HPE. You can open a support ticket with either vendor to start the process. 

If the support ticket shows that resources from the other vendor are required, open a support ticket with that vendor through normal support channels. This approach allows both companies to work together to help you as needed.

## Logging

The log location depends on the product.

### EDB Postgres Advanced Server logs

Navigate to the `Data` directory in your chosen EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance. From there, you can navigate to `log` or `current_logfiles`. Alternatively, you can navigate to the `postgresql.conf` file, which you can use to customize logging options or enable `edb_audit` logs. 

An example of the full path to view EDB Postgres Advanced Server logs is `/var/lib/edb/as15/data/log`.

### EDB Postgres Extended Server logs

Navigate to the `Data` directory in your chosen EDB Postgres Extended Server instance. From there, you can navigate to `log`. Alternatively, you can navigate to the `postgresql.conf` file, which you can use to customize logging options. 

An example of the full path to view EDB Postgres Extended logs is `/var/lib/edb-pge/15/data/log`.

### PostgreSQL Server logs

The default log directories for PostgreSQL logs depend on the operating system:

- Debian-based system: `/var/log/postgresql/postgresql-x.x.main.log. X.x.`

- Red Hat-based system: `/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_log`

- Windows: `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.3\data\pg_log`

### HPE logs
