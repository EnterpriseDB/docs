This section will go through the menu items listed under a database in Quest Foglight to illustrate its monitoring capabilities.  After you have successfully created your EDB Postgres Advanced Server and/or EDB Postgres Extended Server agents to monitor via the steps in the Configure Quest Foglight for EDB Postgres Advanced Server and EDB Postgres Extended Server, you will then have 24/7 access to monitoring and performance tracking via the Quest Foglight web browswer.

To begin, navigate to the Quest Foglight Console either via the shortcut that was installed on your machine during initial installation or navigating to: http://localhost:8080/console and login using the credentials you set during installation.
*Where localhost is the name of the machine that has a running instance of the Management Server.*

Once you are logged in you will be directed to the main dashboard where you can see your EDB agents that you have created.  Click on one of the agent records for the database you want to examine.  You will be taken to an overview page for your EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server database.

### Overview

From the Overview screen you will be able to view and monitor a number of different areas of interest related to your selected database.  Below we have highlighted a few areas with a brief description.
- Databases
- Tables
- Connections
- BG Writer
- Locks
- Configuration
- Statements
- Tablespaces

This first screen is where you will find a general overview of your EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended server agent with graphs of data.
