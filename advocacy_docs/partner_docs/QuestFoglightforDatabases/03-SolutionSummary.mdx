Quest Foglight for databases is a tool that enables monitoring of health and performance issues for all database platforms, whether on-premise, hybrid, or in the cloud.  This tool enables the user to collect their database information in one place and monitor them simultaneously. It offers 24/7 unattended data collection with a straightforward deployment for monitoring.

DBA's can utilize Quest Foglight for Databases' PostgreSQL monitoring capabilities to detect, diagnose, and resolve performance issues on EDB Postgres Advanced and EDB Postgres Extended database servers.  Quest Foglight for Databases uses PostgreSQL 10.x and above, or EDB Postgres 10.x and above to connect their databases and collect and monitor data.  It is important to monitor your databases for health issues so when an issue occurs, you can diagnose and resolve it quickly.

Part of managing your data means monitoring the health of the database platforms it resides on.  It is critical to avoid database downtime or performance issues.  Instead of handling database issues after they happen, it is helpful to continuously monitor them for issues so that you can address them before any downtime can occur.  Reporting is also available to view root causes, and historical performance issues.
