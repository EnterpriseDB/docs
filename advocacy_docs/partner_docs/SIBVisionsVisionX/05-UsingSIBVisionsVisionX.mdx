These examples walk you though some of the common usage scenarios that can be used with EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server. These are examples to help get you started and show how the products can work together.

1. FMB-based migration of an Oracle Forms application to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server/SIB Visions VisionX Low Code application
    - Part 1: FMB-based application migration
    - Part 2: Oracle database to EDB Postgres Advanced Server migration
    - Part 3: Switch database connection to EDB Postgres Advanced Server
2. Data model-based migration of an Oracle Forms/APEX application to an EDB Postgres/SIB Visions VisionX Low Code application
    - Part 1: Data-model-based application migration
    - Part 2: Oracle database to EDB Postgres Advanced Server migration
    - Part 3: Switch database connection to EDB Postgres Advanced Server
3. Create a SIB Visions VisionX application that uses an EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server instance as a data source
    - Create a screen that connects to an existing table from an EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server instance
    - Create a screen that creates a table in the connected EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server instance

## FMB-based migration of an Oracle Forms application to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server/SIB Visions VisionX low-code application

This example shows how an Oracle Forms application is migrated to a SIB Visions VisionX low-code application using an FMB file (Oracle Forms source file). The first step is to migrate the application. In the second step, the Oracle database is migrated to EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server using the usual tools, such as EDB's Migration Toolkit. Then the migrated application is connected to EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server.

### FMB-based application migration

1. Open SIB Visions VisionX and create an application. The Create a New Application screen opens.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration1.png)

2. At the Choose Database step, select **New Database User**. The default settings create a database user in the Postgres database bundled with SIB Visions VisionX. Alternatively, you can use Postgres, EDB Postgres Advanced Server, or EDB Postgres Extended Server here. The database user is used to create the tables for the migrated application’s standard SIB Visions VisionX user management instead of the Oracle Forms user management. Optionally, other authentication systems, such as Windows AD or Open ID system, can easily be integrated.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration2.png)

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration3.png)

3. At the Create Admin User step, provide the user name and password and select **Finish**.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration4.png)

4. A Task List screen shows the application creation progress.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration5.png)

5. Once the application is created, the New Application Screen screen is opened, which allows you to create a screen.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration6.png)

6. At the Creation Mode step, select **Import an Oracle Forms (.fmb) module**.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration7.png)

7. At the next step (Choose Database), select **Existing Database User** and provide the credentials to the Oracle Database used by Oracle Forms.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration8.png)

8. At the Choose Module step, select the FMB file.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration9.png)

   In this example, SIB Visions VisionX analyzes the `orders.fmb` file and shows all included windows/canvases for the selection. 

   The following screenshot shows the `orders.fmb` file in Oracle Forms Builder.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration10.png)

9. After the `.fmb` file is selected, a Task List screen displays the Oracle Forms migration progress.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration11.png)

   After the migrated screen is created, it's displayed in design mode in SIB Visions VisionX, where you can adjust it according to the requirements.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration12.png)

   The SIB Visions VisionX Oracle Forms Migration Extension can migrate FMBs semi-automatically. All user interface elements (Windows/Canvas/Items) and the Oracle Forms Persistence (Blocks) can be migrated automatically. In a manual step, the Oracle Forms application logic (PL/SQL) is compiled into the database. The remaining UI logic is then created in SIB Visions VisionX visually or manually with Java Code.

#### Add logic visually with actions in SIB Visions VisionX

![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration13.png)

#### Modify or add any Java code using Eclipse

1. Import the application in Eclipse by pressing **shift+alt** in the SIB Visions VisionX main view and selecting the icon next to the application.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration14.png)

2. Select a UI element in SIB Visions VisionX and select the purple Eclipse button.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration15.png)

   Eclipse navigates to the relevant Java code. 

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration16.png)

3. Change the **Order Information** label in Eclipse.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration17.png)

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration18.png)

   If you change the code outside of SIB Visions VisionX in Eclipse, the changes are pushed back into the VisionX visual development environment in real time. This capabioity enables unlimited app development for Citizen Developers/Business Users and Pro Developers.

4. Open the screen in the SIB Visions VisionX Live Preview and change some of the data. The data is updated in the Oracle database.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration19.png)

### Oracle database to EDB Postgres Advanced Server migration

In the second step, the Oracle database is migrated to EDB Postgres Advanced Server/EDB Postgres Extended Server using EDB's Migration Toolkit.

The migration steps in connection with an Oracle Forms migration aren't different from a pure Oracle-to-EDB database migration. Therefore, this topic isn't discussed in detail here. Refer to the [Migration Toolkit documentation](/migration_toolkit/latest/).

### Switch database connection to EDB Postgres Advanced Server

Switching from the Oracle database is a simple step in SIB Visions VisionX. In the migrated SIB Visions VisionX application, select the SIB Visions VisionX Settings screen and select the **Datasources** tab. Select **Edit** to change the database connection from Oracle to PostgresSQL.

![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration20.png)

## Data-model-based migration of an Oracle Forms/APEX application to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server/SIB Visions VisionX low-code application

This example shows how an Oracle Forms/APEX application is migrated to a SIB Visions VisionX low-code application using the existing data model. The first step is to migrate the application. In the second step, the Oracle database is migrated to EDB Postgres Advanced Server/EDB Postgres Extended using the usual tools, such as EDBs Migration Toolkit.

Then the migrated application is connected to EDB Postgres Advanced Server/EDB Postgres Extended Server.

### Data model based application migration

First follow Steps 1 to 5 under [FMB-based application migration](#fmb-based-application-migration) before proceeding to step 1.

1. At the Screen Infos step, provide the required information for the screen.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration21.png)

2. At the Choose Layout step, select the required layout for the screen.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration22.png)

3. At the next step (Select Data Source), select the **Use existing data from database tables** option, which allows you to select the tables used in the original Oracle Forms/APEX screen. The screen is migrated based on these tables.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration23.png)

4. At the Choose Database step, provide the connection information for the Oracle database that's used in the Oracle Forms/APEX application.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration24.png)

5. On the next screen, select the tables used in the original Oracle Forms/APEX screen. The screen is migrated based on these tables. 

   Much of the typically manually created logic in Oracle Forms and APEX is automatically recognized in SIB Visions VisionX. All drop-down lists are recognized based on the foreign keys to the master data. If these are missing, they can be defined manually in SIB Visions VisionX. Furthermore, all relevant detail tables are offered for each master table. This makes it very easy to define the master detail relations in the screen.  The appropriate layout of the screen was selected in the previous step. You can change this layout in the UI Designer later.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration25.png)

   `s_Ord` was chosen in this example because it's the master table of the Oracle Forms screen.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration26.png)

   The dropdown lists for `S_Customer`, `A_Payment Type`, and `S_Emp` for the sales rep of the order are detected automatically.
  
   In the next step, select **More** and add the Master/Detail relationship to the `S_Item` table.
   
   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration27.png)

6. Once the screen is created, it's displayed in design mode where you can adjust it according to the requirements.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration28.png)

   To get the image for each product as in the original Oracle Form, add the product table in the lower area using the **New Table** tab. 
   
   Here, use the same steps as for the selection of the `S_Ord` table, except that you select the `S_Product` table instead. `S_Product` was chosen because it's a detail to the `S_Item` table.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration29.png)

   Repeat the same for the `S_Image` table because `S_Image` is a detail to the `S_Product` table.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration30.png)
   
   Then define the `Image` column as `Image` datatype by selecting the datatype dropdown. You can later position it on the screen as an image.

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration31.png)
   
   Next, connect the `S_Product` table as a detail to the `S_Item` table. To do this, select the `S_Product` table at the bottom of the editor and select the **Edit** icon. Then select **More** and select the `S_Item` as **Master Table**.
   
   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration32.png)
   
   Repeat the same for the `S_Image` table because `S_Image` is a detail to the `S_Product`.
   
   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration33.png)
   
   Select the screen’s detail area by selecting **Details** on the orange bar at the top of the Orders screen. Then select the `S_Image` table in the lower area and position the image editor on the top-right corner of the screen by dragging it.
   
   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration34.png)

7. Open the screen in the Live Preview. Just a few steps were needed to create the Oracle Forms screen in SIB Visions VisionX based on the current data model. An additional list view with a search function was also created.
   
   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration35.png)

   ![Create a New Application](Images/FMBMigration36.png)

### Oracle database to EDB Postgres Advanced Server migration

In the second step, the Oracle database is migrated to EDB Postgres Advanced Server/EDB Postgres Extended Server using EDB's Migration Toolkit.

The migration steps in connection with an Oracle Forms migration aren't different from a pure Oracle-to-EDB Postgres Advanced Server database migration. Therefore, this topic isn't discussed in detail here. Refer to the [Migration Toolkit documentation](/migration_toolkit/latest/).
