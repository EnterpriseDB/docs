Nutanix AHV hosts the virtual machines created so that you can deploy / redeploy them as needed.

To use Nutanix AHV:

1. Log in to Prism.

1. Go to the **Table** tab where you can view the virtual machines deployed via Nutanix AHV. For example, this screenshot shows VMs that host the following EDB products:

    - EDB Postgres Advanced (EPAS)
    - EDB Failover Manager (EFM)
    - Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM)
    - Backup Recovery Manager (Barman)
