Implementing Commvault Backup & Recovery with an EDB database requires the following components:

- EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server
- Commvault Backup & Recovery software

## Prerequisites

- A running EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server instance
- Commvault Backup & Recovery installed
- EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server application path and library directory path, for example, `c:\Program Files\edb\as13\bin` and `c:\Program Files\edb\as13\lib`
- The login credentials used to access the EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server database
- EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server archive log directory configured

## Configure Commvault Backup & Recovery for EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server

### Set up a disk storage pool 

1. From the machine where Commvault Backup & Recovery is installed, run the Core Setup wizard from the Commvault Backup & Recovery's Command Center. The wizard helps to set up a disk storage pool and to modify the server backup plan according to your requirements.
2. Set up storage pool/disk storage. From the Welcome page, select **Let's get started**. On the **Disk** tab, in the **Name** box, enter a name for the storage pool.
3. In the **MediaAgent** box, accept the default value.
4. For **Type**, select **Local**.
5. In the **Backup location** box, select **Browse** to assign a path to store backups.
6. To enable deduplication on the storage, move the **Use deduplication** toggle key to the right. In the **Deduplication DB location** box, browse to select the path to the deduplication database.
7. Select **Save**, which moves you to the next setup option.

### Set up database server backup plan

Next, create a server backup plan in Core Setup. To create a server backup plan in Core Setup, define where the data is stored and how often the data gets backed up.

1. In the **Plan name** box, enter the name of the plan, such as `EPAS Server Plan`.
1. In the **Backup destinations** section, select the storage and retention period.
11. In the **RPO** section, select the backup frequency and the time for each backup to start.

### Install a client on an EDB database

1. From the Navigation pane of the Commvault Backup & Recovery's Command Center, select **Protect > Databases**.
2. Select **Add server**.
3. Select the database type for EDB database, which in this case is **PostgreSQL**.

4. In the **Database server name** box, enter the server name.
5. In the **Username** and **Password** boxes, enter the credentials to connect to the server.
6. From the **Plan** list, select the server plan you entered in step 1 when you set up the database server backup plan.

7. After the server is added, a job runs to install a client on the server. The images show the process from job creation to software installation.

### Configure the EDB database instances to back up and protect

1. From the navigation pane, select **Protect > Databases > DB Instances**.
2. Select **Add instance**, and then select **PostgreSQL**.

3. From the **Server name** list, select the server where you want to create the new instance.
4. In the **Instance Name** box, enter the EDB database instance name.
5. From the **Plan** list, select the server plan you set up for use with your EDB database.
6. Under **Connection details**, enter the following information.
   - In the **Database user** box, enter the user name to access the EDB database instance.
   - In the **Password** box, enter the EDB database user account password.
   - In the **Port** box, enter the port to open the communication between the EDB database and the clients.
   - In the **Maintenance DB** box, enter the name of a system database that's used as a maintenance database.
   - In the **PostgreSQL** section, enter paths for **Binary Directory**, **Lib Directory**, and **Archive Log Directory**.
