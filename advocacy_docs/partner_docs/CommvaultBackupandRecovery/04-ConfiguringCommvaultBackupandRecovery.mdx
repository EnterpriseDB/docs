Implementing Commvault Backup & Recovery with an EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Extended Server, or PostgreSQL Server database requires the following components:

- EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Extended Server, or PostgreSQL Server
- Commvault Backup & Recovery software

!!! Note
    We refer to the EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Extended Server, and PostgreSQL Server products as the Postgres distribution. The specific distribution type depends on your needs and preferences.

## Prerequisites

- A running Postgres distribution
- Commvault Backup & Recovery installed
- Postgres distribution application path and library directory path, for example, `c:\Program Files\edb\as15\bin` and `c:\Program Files\edb\as15\lib`
- The login credentials used to access the Postgres distribution database
- Postgres distribution archive log directory configured

## Configure Commvault Backup & Recovery for Postgres distribution

### Set up a disk storage pool 

1. From the machine where Commvault Backup & Recovery is installed, run the Core Setup wizard from the Commvault Backup & Recovery Command Center. The wizard helps to set up a disk storage pool and to modify the server backup plan according to your requirements.
2. Set up storage pool/disk storage. From the Welcome page, select **Let's get started**. On the **Disk** tab, in the **Name** box, enter a name for the storage pool.
3. In the **MediaAgent** box, accept the default value.
4. For **Type**, select **Local**.
5. In the **Backup location** box, select **Browse** to assign a path to store backups.
6. To enable deduplication on the storage, move the **Use deduplication** toggle key to the right. In the **Deduplication DB location** box, browse to select the path to the deduplication database.
7. Select **Save**, which moves you to the next setup option.

### Set up database server backup plan

Next, create a server backup plan in Core Setup. To create a server backup plan in Core Setup, define where the data is stored and how often the data gets backed up.

1. In the **Plan name** box, enter the name of the plan, such as `EPAS Server Plan`.
1. In the **Backup destinations** section, select the storage and retention period.
11. In the **RPO** section, select the backup frequency and the time for each backup to start.

### Install a client on a Postgres distribution database

1. From the Navigation pane of the Commvault Backup & Recovery Command Center, select **Protect > Databases**.
2. Select **Add server**.
3. Select the database type for the Postgres distribution database, which in this case is **PostgreSQL**.

4. In the **Database server name** box, enter the server name.
5. In the **Username** and **Password** boxes, enter the credentials to connect to the server.
6. From the **Plan** list, select the server plan you entered in step 1 when you set up the database server backup plan.

7. After the server is added, a job runs to install a client on the server. The images show the process from job creation to software installation.

### Configure the Postgres distribution instances to back up and protect

1. From the navigation pane, select **Protect > Databases > DB Instances**.
2. Select **Add instance**, and then select **PostgreSQL**.

3. From the **Server name** list, select the server where you want to create the new instance.
4. In the **Instance Name** box, enter the Postgres distribution database instance name.
5. From the **Plan** list, select the server plan you set up for use with your Postgres distribution database.
6. Under **Connection details**, enter the following information.
   - In the **Database user** box, enter the user name to access the Postgres distribution database instance.
   - In the **Password** box, enter the Postgres distribution database user account password.
   - In the **Port** box, enter the port to open the communication between the Postgres distribution and the clients.
   - In the **Maintenance DB** box, enter the name of a system database that's used as a maintenance database.
   - In the **PostgreSQL** section, enter paths for **Binary Directory**, **Lib Directory**, and **Archive Log Directory**.
