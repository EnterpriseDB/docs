You can back up and restore a Postgres distribution database using Commvault Backup & Recovery.

## Using Commvault Backup & Recovery

Commvault provides two methods of taking the backup from a Postgres distribution database and restoring it:

-  DumpBasedBackupSet backup and restore
-  FSBasedBackupSet backup and restore

!!! Note
    At this time, there's a known issue with FSBased Incremental/PITR Restore that doesn't allow for proper restoration of the database using the defined process. See [Known issues](#known-issues) for more information and workarounds. 

### DumpBasedBackupSet backup and restore

Dump-based backup uses the pg_dump utility to take the backup.

## Taking a DumpBasedBackupSet backup 

1. Open the Commvault Backup & Recovery Command Center. From the navigation pane, select **Protect > Databases**.

2. Select the required instance.

3. In the **Backup sets** section, select **DumpBasedBackupSet**.

4. In the **Database groups** section, select the database group that you want to back up. In this case it's **default**.

5. In the **Backup** section, select **Back up now**.

   ![Backup Section](Images/Dumpbackup4.png)

6. In the Select Backup Level screen, select **Full**.

   A job is created to take the backup.

8. When the backup job is complete, its status changes to Completed.

## Restoring a DumpBasedBackupSet backup 

You can use DumpBasedBackupSet to restore the individual databases.

1. From the navigation pane, select **Protect > Databases**.
2. Select the instance that you want to restore.
3. In the **Recovery points** calendar, select **DumpBasedBackupSet**.

   ![Recovery Points Calendar](Images/Dumprestore1.png)

4. Select a date from the calendar, and then select **Restore**.
5. The Backup Content screen displays the databases to restore. Select the required database to restore, or select all of them to restore all.

   ![Backup Content Screen](Images/Dumprestore2.png)

6. Select **Restore**.
7. From the **Restore Options** screen, select the destination server and destination instance. Then select **Submit**.

   A job is created to restore the backup.

8. When the restore has completed successfully, log in to the Postgres distribution database and check that the restore operation recovered the data. This example connected to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance:

### FSBasedBackupSet backup and restore
A file system backup backs up data that resides on a Windows or UNIX computer.

## Taking a FSBasedBackupSet backup
1. Open the Commvault Backup & Recovery Command Center. From the navigation pane, go to **Protect > Databases**.

2. Select the required instance.

3. In the **Backup sets** section, select the **FSBasedBackupSet** backup set.

4. In the **Database groups** section, select the database group that you want to back up. In this case, it's **default**.

5. In the **Backup** section, select **Back up**.

6. In the **Select Backup Level** screen, choose between a full or incremental backup. This example uses an incremental backup.

   ![Select FSBased Backup Type](Images/SelectFSBasedBackupType.png)

7. A job is created to take the backup. View the job by selecting the **Job ID** for that backup.

   ![FSBased Backup Job](Images/FSBasedBackupJob.png)

8. When the job is complete, you can find the information about the job on the job's page.

   ![FSBased Backup Job Details](Images/FSBasedBackupJobDetails.png)

## Restoring a FSBasedBackupSet full backup
You can restore backed-up data for a subclient or an entire backup set using either an in-place restore, out-of-place restore, or, for a Linux file server, to a standalone file server.

1. Ensure that your Postgres distribution instance is stopped.

2. Delete or rename the WAL directory and data directory.

3. From the Commvault navigation pane, go to **Protect > Databases**.

4. Select the instance you want to restore.

5. In the **Recovery Points** calender, select **FSBasedBackupSet**.

6. Select a date when a full FSBasedBackupSet was taken and select **Restore**.

7. The Backup Content screen displays the databases to restore. Select the required database to restore, or select all of them to restore all.

   ![FSBased Backup Restore Databases](Images/FSBasedFullRestoreDatabases.png)

8. Select **Restore**.

9. From the Restore Options screen, select where you want the restore to complete: in-place, out-of-place, or restore to disk for a Linux server.

   ![FSBased Backup Restore Details](Images/FSBasedFullRestoreOptions.png)

10. Select the **Destination Server** and **Destination Instance**, and select **Submit**.

11. A job is created to restore the backup.

12. When the restore has completed successfully, Commvault starts the server using the pg_ctl utility.

    You can check that the server was started successfully with a command like, `"C:\Program Files\edb\as15\bin\pg_ctl" -U enterprisedb status -D "C:\Program Files\edb\as15\data"`. It returns a message that the server is running.

```bash
C:\Program Files\edb\as15>"C:\Program Files\edb\as15\bin\pg_ctl" -U enterprisedb status -D "C:\Program Files\edb\as15\data"
pg_ctl: server is running (PID: 20896)
C:/Program Files/edb/as15/bin/edb-postgres.exe "-D" "C:\Program Files\edb\as15\data"
```

14. If you want the server to be controlled by a Services utility, you need to stop it with the pg_ctl utility and start it again in your Services utility, for example, Services(Local) in Windows or systemctl in UNIX.

15. After you start the service using your utility of choice, log in to your EDB database and check that the restore operation recovered the data.

## Known issues

FSBaseBackupSet Incremental or Point-In-Time(PITR) Restore has issues with PostgreSQL server, EDB Postgres Advanced Server, and EDB Postgres Extended versions 13 and later. The behavior is due to a change that was made in Postgres version 13. From the release notes, `Generate an error if recovery does not reach the specified recovery target`. While Commvault does provide a time target for the recovery, the recovery is performed entirely by Postgres, and Postgres doesn't know how to reach that time target. Therefore, it fails. This can happen when there are no transactions between backup jobs.  

A workaround for this issue is to always introduce a transaction scenario, such as a create and drop database, before doing a log backup. Another workaround is to use `recovery_target_lsn` in the `postgresql.conf` file instead of using `recovery_target_time`. 

Commvault is aware of this error and is working on a fix.
