## Support

Technical support for the use of these products is provided by both EDB and Commvault. A support contract must be in place at both EDB and Commvault. You can open a support ticket with either company to start the process. If it's determined through the support ticket that resources from the other vendor are required, open a support ticket with that vendor through normal support channels. This approach allows both companies to work together to help you as needed.

## Logging

The following logs are available.

### EDB Postgres Advanced Server logs

Navigate to the `Data` directory in your chosen EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance. From there, you can navigate to `log` or `current_logfiles`. Or, you can navigate to the `postgresql.conf` file where you can customize logging options or enable `edb_audit` logs.

### EDB Postgres Extended Server logs

Navigate to the `Data` directory in your chosen EDB Postgres Extended Server instance. From there you can navigate to `log`, or you can navigate to the `postgresql.conf` file where you can customize logging options.  An example of the full path to view EDB Postgres Extended logs is `/var/lib/edb-pge/15/data/log`.

### PostgreSQL Server logs

The default log directories for PostgreSQL logs vary depending on the operating system:

- Debian-based system: `/var/log/postgresql/postgresql-x.x.main.log. X.x.`

- Red Hat-based system: `/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_log`

- Windows: `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.3\data\pg_log`

### Commvault logs

You can find Commvault logs using either of these methods:

- Look in the Content Store directory/folder in the Commvault folder on your system. For example, on a Windows system, the log file path is `C:\Program Files\Commvault\ContentStore\LogFiles`. There you can see all of the different types of logs Commvault collects.  

- Gather some job-specific logs in the Commvault interface:

  1. Open the Commvault Backup & Recovery Command Center. From the navigation pane, go to **Jobs > Job History**.

  2. Find the specific job you want to view logs for, and select **...** next to that job.

  3. Select **View Logs**.
