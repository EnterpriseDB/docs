Commvault enables your business to streamline management of its continuously evolving data environment, whether the data is on premises or in the cloud.

Commvault PostgreSQL iDataAgent provides the flexibility to back up PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Advanced Server, and EDB Postgres Extended Server databases in different modes and restore them when needed. You can perform a full/log backup or restore of database servers, individual databases, and archive logs at any time and have full control over the process.

Managing your data means knowing that it's protected and being able to effectively report on success or failure. Through an easy-to-use interface, you can quickly check on the progress of your jobs to ensure things are moving as expected. To keep you in the know, you can also use prebuilt reports either on demand or on a scheduled basis.
