### Prerequisites

- A running EDB Postgres Advanced (EPAS) instance.

2. Move the postgresql JAR to the Liquibase Pro directory.
3. Login to your Liquibase Hub account and click on the `Settings` icon on the left side of the page to access the API Key.
4. Copy the API key, which connects the information generated by your changelogs and other operations to your Liquibase Hub projects.

  a. Driver class path

  b. Database connection string

  c. User authentication information for the database you want to capture

  d. Liquibase Pro license key

  e. Liquibase Hub API key

See a sample [liquibase.properties](07-Appendix.mdx) file in the appendix for configuring Liquibase for EDB Postgres Advanced.
