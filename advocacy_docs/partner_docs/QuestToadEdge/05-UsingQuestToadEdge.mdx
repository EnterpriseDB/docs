After you connect an instance of EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended to Quest Toad Edge, you can access the capabilities of Toad Edge. 

# Sample user scenarios

3. Enter the username and password, and select **OK**.

  You're now connected to your database instance.

## Viewing tables and data

Using the appropriate SQL code, three tables (`AGENTS`, `CUSTOMERS`, and `ORDERS`) were created in the `edb` database and data was inserted to help visualize some basic functionality.

1. When you connect to the database, a SQL Editor area is open for your database. In this example, it's `edb`. If it isn't open, you can select **SQL Editor** at the top to open a new one.
