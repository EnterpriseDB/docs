VisionX is a flexible and independent low-code platform, enabling both business users and professional developers to visually develop web, desktop and native mobile applications extremely fast. These can be very simple applications that replace paper processes or Excel sheets, easy-to-use forms on ERP systems, dashboards, mobile apps, and even  highly complex billing applications, customer portals or trading systems. 

The VisionX low-code platform supports all major databases, such as Postgres, and EDB Postgres Advanced Server. VisionX is automatically bundled with a Postgres database and is a low-code platform for Postgres.

VisionX and its Oracle Forms Migration Extension is an efficient solution for semi-automated migration of Oracle Forms and Oracle APEX into modern web and mobile applications. Together with an Oracle database to EDB Postgres Advanced Server migration, it provides a fast, smooth, and reliable Oracle exit strategy.

With VisionX, you are 100% vendor independent and can create any web application, no matter how complex. You own the generated Java code, which only uses open source libraries. The created applications can be modified independently of VisionX in any Java IDE and run independently of VisionX in any cloud or on-premise environment. 

When you change code outside of VisionX in Eclipse, the changes are pushed back into the VisionX visual development environment in real time. This two-way synchronization enables 100% unlimited app development for Citizen Developers / Business Users and Pro Developers.
