## Support

Technical support for the use of these products is provided by both EDB and Veeam.  A proper support contract is required to be in place at both EDB and Veeam.  A support ticket can be opened on either side to start the process.  If it is determined through the support ticket that resources from the other vendor is required, the customer should open a support ticket with that vendor through normal support channels.  This will allow both companies to work together to help the customer as needed.

## Logging
