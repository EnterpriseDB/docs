Common backup/restore operations for PostgreSQL databases using Veritas NetBackup for PostgreSQL are:
- Performing backups - takes backup of the database and stores it in a predetermined location.
- Querying backups - lists available database backups.
- Performing restores - restores the database from a backup previously taken:
    - Local restore - database files are restored to the same host as the client.
    - Redirected restore - database files are restored to a different host than the client.


### Sample User Scenarios


**Performing Backups**

To take a backup of the database, enter the command on the NetBackup Client:

`/usr/NBPostgreSQLAgent/nbpgsql -o backup`


**Querying Backups**

To list available database backups, enter the command on the NetBackup Client:

`/usr/NBPostgreSQLAgent/nbpgsql -o query`

**Performing Restores**

Database restores can be performed in the following two scenarios:

- Local Restore.
- Redirected Restore.


**Local Restore**

In this scenario, the database files are restored on the original (source) database server host (default 
option). 

To perform a local restore, use the steps below: 

1. Stop the database server.

2. Create the target directory to store the database files to be used for the restore operation:

    `mkdir <target-directory>`

3. Determine the database backup id you want to use for the restore by querying available backups:

	`/usr/NBPostgreSQLAgent/nbpgsql -o query`

4. Restore the database files to the target directory:

    `/usr/NBPostgreSQLAgent/nbpgsql -o restore -t <target-directory> -id <db-backup-id>`

5. Once the restore operation is completed, replace the data directory (PGDATA) with the contents 
of the target directory.

6. Set the following parameters in `postgresql.conf` file:
    ```
    restore_command = 'cp /var/lib/edb/as13/data/pgarchive/%f %p'
    ```

7. Start the PostgreSQL server.



**Redirected Restore**

In this scenario, the database files are restored on a (target) database server host which is different from original (source) database server.

To perform a redirected restore, use the steps below: 

1. Stop the database server on the target host.

2. Create the target directory on the target host to store the database files to be used for the restore operation:

	`mkdir <target-directory>`

3. Determine the database backup id you want to use for the restore by querying available backups on the source host:

	`/usr/NBPostgreSQLAgent/nbpgsql -o query -C <source-db-server-host>`

4. Restore the database files to the target directory on the target host:

    `/usr/NBPostgreSQLAgent/nbpgsql -o restore -t <target-directory> -id <db-backup-id> -C <source-db-server-host>`

5. Once the restore operation is completed, replace the data directory `PGDATA` on the target host with the contents of the target directory.

6. Set the following parameters in postgresql.conf file on the target host:
    ```
    restore_command = 'cp /var/lib/edb/as13/data/pgarchive/%f %p'
    ```

7. Start the PostgreSQL server on the target host.
