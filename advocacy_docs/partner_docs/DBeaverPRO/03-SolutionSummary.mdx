DBeaver PRO is a SQL client software application and universal database management tool for EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Extended Server, and PostgreSQL. With DBeaver PRO, you can manipulate your data like you would in a regular spreadsheet. You can view, create, modify, save, and delete all Postgres data types. The features resemble those of a regular spreadsheet, as you can create analytical reports based on records from different data storages and export information in an appropriate format. DBeaver PRO also provides you with a powerful editor for SQL, data and schema migration, monitoring of database connection sessions, and other administration features.
