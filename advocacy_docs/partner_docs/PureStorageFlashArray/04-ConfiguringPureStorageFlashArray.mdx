Implementing Pure Storage FlashArray with EDB Postgres Advanced Server requires the following components:

- EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL server.
- Pure Storage FlashArray subscription.
- Additional hardware as described in the [Hardware Environment Requirements](https://support.purestorage.com/Solutions/PostgreSQL/Getting_Started/PostgreSQL_on_FlashArray_Implementation_and_Best_Practices) section of the Pure Storage Best Practices document.

## Prerequisites

- A running EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL instance.
- Linux or Windows File System Configuration as defined in the [FlashArray Implementation and Best Practices](https://support.purestorage.com/Solutions/PostgreSQL/Getting_Started/PostgreSQL_on_FlashArray_Implementation_and_Best_Practices) documentation.
- The hardware protocol for your instance.
- The layout defined for where the FlashArray volumes will be mounted.

## Configure Pure Storage FlashArray for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 

Configuring Pure Storage FlashArray for EDB Postgres Advanced server requires the following steps to be taken.

1. First you must select your OS (either Windows or Linux) and configure to your specifications according to the [PostgreSQL on FlashArray Implementation and Best Practices](https://support.purestorage.com/Solutions/PostgreSQL/Getting_Started/PostgreSQL_on_FlashArray_Implementation_and_Best_Practices) document.

2. Install [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/) or PostgreSQL.

3. Initialize your EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL instance.

There are best practices for both Linux and Windows servers for Flash Array and these can be found at [Linux Recommended Settings](https://support.purestorage.com/Solutions/Linux/Linux_Reference/Linux_Recommended_Settings) and [Validate Windows Server with Test-WindowsBestPractices Cmdlet](https://support.purestorage.com/Solutions/Microsoft_Platform_Guide/FlashArray_Connectivity/aaa11_Validate_Windows_Server_with_Test-WindowsBestPractices_Cmdlet) respectively.

## Selecting Pure Storage FlashArray Hardware Environment Requirements for EDB Postgres Advanced Server

In order to access your block storage on Pure Storage FlashArray, you must first define which protocol is best for your environment and then set up that protocol.  Listed below are the different types of protocols for FlashArray and their requirements.

More information on these protocols and their requirements can be found in the [PostgreSQL on FlashArray Implementation and Best Practices](https://support.purestorage.com/Solutions/PostgreSQL/Getting_Started/PostgreSQL_on_FlashArray_Implementation_and_Best_Practices) document.

!!! Note
    Note from Pure Storage: The recommendation for volumes from FlashArray is to mount a volume to the following locations with the correct permissions set before installing PostgreSQL:  
    *Microsoft Windows* - `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\` Permissions - PostgreSQL service account - READ Permissions on all directories leading up to the service directory, WRITE permissions are required only on the data directory  
    *Linux* - `/var/lib/pgsql` (Permissions - user postgres, group postgres, drwx------)


**For EDB Postgres Advanced Server instances the volumes mount points are as follows:**  
    *Windows*- `C:\Program Files/edb/as-"version"`  
    *Linux*- `/var/lib/edb/"version"`
