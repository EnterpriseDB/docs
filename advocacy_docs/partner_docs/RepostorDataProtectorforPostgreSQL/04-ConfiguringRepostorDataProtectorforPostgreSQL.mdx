## Prerequisites

- The database host with the EDB Postgres Advanced Server environment needs the following components:
    
  - IBM supported operating system for Spectrum Protect clients

  - IBM Spectrum Protect BA client (used for regular file backup)

  - IBM Spectrum Protect API client

  - EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 10 or later

  - Repostor Data Protector client


- A PostgreSQL user must be defined for use with the RDP.
    
  - This user must be able to connect to EDB Postgres Advanced Server and have sufficient permissions for
database backup and restore.

  - This user needs access to local Spectrum Protect files to read configuration files and to write to log files.

    !!! Note
        If the user isn't the same user that owns the PostgreSQL server process, make sure that the server process owner has the correct SP client file access so they can execute `archive_command`.

- A Spectrum Protect node must be defined in the Spectrum Protect server environment in a
management class that suits the needs of the DBA team.

- The Spectrum Protect client details for setting up connection to Spectrum Protect server must be
available, including the client Spectrum Protect password.


## Installing and configuring Repostor Data Protector for PostgreSQL

The high-level steps for installing and configuring the integration are:

1. [Configure local Spectrum Protect configuration files.](/#configure-local-spectrum-protect-configuration-files)
1. [Install Repostor Data Protector client.](#install-repostor-data-protector-client)
1. [Verify the connection to PostgreSQL psql.](/#verify-the-connection-to-postgresql-psql)
1. [Configure PostgreSQL `archive_command` to use logwriter.](#configure-postgresql-archive_command-to-use-logwriter)
1. [Set up a backup script.](#set-up-a-backup-script)

### Configure the local Spectrum Protect configuration files 

Configure the local Spectrum Protect configuration files with details needed to connect to
Spectrum Protect server.

1. Create a Spectrum Protect options file with the logical server name.

2. Edit the `dsm.sys` file by adding a section for the new logical server name for this Spectrum Protect node with
connection details.

3. Create soft links from the API directory to the ba clients `bin` directory for `dsm.sys` and `dsm.opt`. This example uses `dsm.postgres.opt` Spectrum Protect options for the filename:

   ``` 
    ln -s /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsm.sys
        /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin64/dsm.sys
    ln -s /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsm.postgres.opt
        /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/api/bin64/dsm.opt
   ```    

   Here's the listing (`ls -l` command) from the API directory for this example showing the links:

   ```    
    dsm.opt -> /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsm.postgres.opt
    dsm.sys -> /opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsm.sys
   ```    

4. Set the `DSMI_CONFIG` variable for the OS user that runs the RDP tools, preferably the same user
that owns the PostgreSQL server process.

5. Verify that the OS user can connect to Spectrum Protect server, which also verifies correct file access to local SP files:
    
   ``` 
   dsmc q session -se=XXX
   ``` 
  
  Where ‘XXX’ is your logical server name.
    

### Install the Repostor Data Protector client

1. Verify that IBM Spectrum Protect clients for API and BA are already installed. For example:

   ```    
    rpm -aq | grep TIV
    TIVsm-API64-8.1.8-0.x86_64
    TIVsm-BA-8.1.8-0.x86_64
   ```   

2. Install RDP. (Verify that you have the latest version on www.repostor.com.)
    ```   
    rpm -ivh rdp4Postgres-4.4.4.0-31.x86_64
    ```   
    If you're on Ubuntu, you need to prepare the package with the `alien` tool:
    
    ```
     sudo apt-get install alien
     sudo alien rdp4Postgres-4.4.4.0-31.x86_64.rpm
     sudo dpkg -I rdp4Postgres-4.4.4.0-31.deb
    ```


3. Install the license file. The `license.dat` file should be placed in the Repostor `/opt/repostor/rdp4Postgres/etc` directory. If no
license is available yet, a trial license is generated the first time you run a backup. This
trial license needs to be cleared with a special `UNLOCK` key before changing to a contract license.

4. Add the Repostor `bin` directory to the PATH. All users that run RDP commands need to have the PATH set to include the Repostor `bin` directory.
The path is `/opt/repostor/rdp4Postgres/bin`.

### Verify the connection to PostgreSQL psql

The user used with the `-u` option to the RDP commands must be able to connect to PostgreSQL and be
allowed to back up/restore databases.

For example, to verify the connection for user enterprisedb:

```
    psql -U enterprisedb -l
```
### Configure PostgreSQL `archive_command` to use logwriter

If your PostgreSQL environment has WAL activated and you plan to back up PostgreSQL on the instance
level (`-f` option with RDP), then you need to configure the PostgreSQL `archive_command` to run the
RDP `logwriter.script`.

For example, this is a sample specification of the `archive_command` in the `postgresql.conf` file:
```
    archive_command =
    ‘/opt/repostor/rdp4Postgres/bin/logwriter.script -v -S instName
    -s “%p” -d %f’
```
!!! note
    The instance name you specify with the `-S` option must be the same as the one you use with the RDP `postgresbackup`
    command. The `logwriter.script` is a script that calls the logwriter binary. It's a script to allow for local configuration if you want
    to set a specific environment before running the logwriter.

### Set up a backup script

If you run `postgresbackup` from a script that initiated from Spectrum Protect scheduler, set `LOGNAME`.

In this example, the paths and filenames are unique to each installation:

```
    #!/bin/bash
    #

    ### Set PATH & DSMI_CONFIG
    export PATH=$PATH:/opt/repostor/rdp4Postgres/bin
    export DSMI_CONFIG=/opt/tivoli/tsm/client/ba/bin/dsm.postgres.opt

    ### Set LOGNAME
    export LOGNAME=enterprisedb

    ### Run postgresbackup command, send output to logfile under /tmp
    postgresbackup -u enterprisedb -f -z -v >/tmp/postgresbackup.log 2>&1
```
