When you have configured your Kubernetes environment per the `Configuring` section you will then be able to start taking backups and completing restores.

## Launch a Backup

1. Launch your Kasten K10 interface.

2. Use Kasten K10 to launch a backup that creates two restore points, a local and a remote.

3. You now have a backup we can use to validate a restore in the next section.

!!! Note
    The Kasten by Veeam backup process is explained below:
    1. EDB elects a replica for the backup.
    2. Kasten will discover the replica.
    3. Kasten calls the EDB pre-backup command on the discovered replica.
    4. The replica becomes ready for the backup.
    5. Kasten takes the backup.
    6. Kasten calls the EDB post backup command on the replica.
    7. The replica leaves the backup mode.
    8. The backup is then over and is consistent for a restore.


## Restore Database

1. To get ready for Kasten K10 to complete a restore, we will remove the EDB namespace in this example.

```bash
kubectl delete ns edb
```

2. In the Kasten K10 interface go to your remote restore point.

3. On the remote restore point select `restore`.

4. After the restore is complete, all of your data will be present.
