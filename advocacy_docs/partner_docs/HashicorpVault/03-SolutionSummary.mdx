Hashicorp Vault is an identity-based secrets and encryption management system. Used in conjunction with EDB Postgres Advanced Server versions 15.2 and above, it allows users to control access to encryption keys and certificates, as well as perform key management. Using Hashicorp Vault’s KMIP secrets engine allows Vault to act as a KMIP server provider and handle the lifecycle of KMIP managed objects.

Hashicorp Vault’s KMIP secrets engine manages its own listener to service any KMIP requests that operate on KMIP managed objects. The KMIP secrets engine determines the set of KMIP operations that the clients can perform based on roles that are assigned.
