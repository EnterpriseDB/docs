Nutanix AHV hosts the virtual machines created so that you can deploy / redeploy them as needed.

To use Nutanix AHV:

1. Log in to Prism.

1. Go to the **Table** tab where you can view the virtual machines deployed via Nutanix AHV. For example, this screenshot shows VMs that host the following EDB products:

    - EDB Postgres Advanced Server
    - EDB Postgres Extended Server
    - Failover Manager
    - Postgres Enterprise Manager
    - Barman
