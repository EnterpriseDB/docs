EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Extended Server, EDB Failover Manager, Postgres Enterprise Manager, and Backup and
Recovery Manager can each be deployed on virtual machines created via the native Nutanix hypervisor,
AHV or VMWare ESXi. AHV represents a unique approach to virtualization that offers powerful capabilities needed
to deploy and manage enterprise applications. AHV complements the value of Hyper-converged infrastructure (HCI)
by integrating native virtualization along with networking, infrastructure, and operations management within
a single intuitive interface - Nutanix Prism.

The following diagram shows a high-level architecture of the Nutanix platform:
