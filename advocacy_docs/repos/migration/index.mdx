!!! Warning Repos 1.0 sunset
The Repos 1.0 repositories are due to be sunset by the end of 2024. After that, you will no longer have access to them. We recommend that you migrate to the Repos 2.0 repositories as soon as possible.
!!!

We recommend that you perform the two steps to this process in order. The first step is to remove the old Repos 1.0 repositories from your system. The second step is to add the new Repos 2.0 repositories to your system. 

It's possible to perform the steps in the reverse order. However, you must ensure that no processes are running during the migration that might attempt to update or install packages.

## Remove Repos 1.0 repositories

The first step in migrating is to remove the Repos 1.0 entry from your machine's repository list.

### Debian/Ubuntu

Run:

```
sudo su -c 'rm /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
```


### RHEL and derivatives

Run:

```
sudo rm /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
```


### SUSE

Run:

```
zypper rr https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo
```


## Add Repos 2.0 repositories

The next step is to add the Repos 2.0 repositories to your machine. You can use the instructions in the [Getting started](../getting_started). 

* For all other subscriptions and software, see [Getting started using repositories with the CLI](../getting_started/with_cli).
* If you want to use the web interface and have only an Enterprise subscription, see [Getting started using repositories on the web](../getting_started/with_web).
