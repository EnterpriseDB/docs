## Tokens and EDB accounts

To download EDB software, you need a token. 
This token is a string that identifies you and your eligibility to download software from EDB. 
If you have an account on EDB, you already have a token and can retrieve it.

If you don't have an account, [sign up for a free EDB account](https://www.edbpostgres.com/accounts/register). 
Signing up gives you a 60-day trial subscription to EDB's software repositories. 

## Getting your token

1. Go to the [EDB Repos 2.0](https://edbpostgres.com/repos-downloads) page.

    If you're not already logged in, log in to your EDB account to access this page. After you log in, go to the Account Profile page. On the Account Profile page, select **Repo Access**.

1.  On the EDB Repositories page, if it's your first visit, select **Request Access** to generate your Repos 2.0 token. 

1. To copy the token to the clipboard, select the **Copy Token** icon. Then store the token safely.

After you create your EDB account and generate your token, you can go to [edbpostgres.com/downloads](https://edbpostgres.com/repos-downloads/) and configure your system to use the EDB repositories.

## Next step

Next, [add the EDB repository to your system](add_your_repository).
