To get started, you need to have an Enterprise subscription to EDB software. The web-based version of the repository system currently supports only Enterprise subscriptions.

!!! Note
If you want to install software from other EDB repositories, such as `community360` or `postgres_distributed`, you need to use the command line interface. See [Getting started using repositories with the CLI](../with_cli).
!!!

To install packages from EDB repositories using the web-based interface, you need to: 

1. [Get your token](get_your_token).
1. [Add your repository](add_your_repository).
1. [Install the package you need](install_package).

## Next steps

Once you've mastered package installation, you can move on to [working with repositories](../../working_with_repos). Learn how to directly browse repositories and download packages, create local mirrors, handle air-gapped installations, and integrate with configuration management tools.
