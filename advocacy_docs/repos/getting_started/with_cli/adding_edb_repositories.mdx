description: How to add EDB repositories to your system using the command line
---

Using the command line to add repositories allows you more flexibility when adding EDB repositories to your system than using the website. The website currently supports only Enterprise subscriptions, but the CLI allows you to add any EDB repository, including `community360`, `standard`, `enterprise`, and `postgres_distributed`.

See [Repositories by name](/repos/reference/repositories_by_name) for a list of repositories and the subscriptions that can access them. If you don't know what your subscription is, contact your EDB account manager or support representative.

1. From your EDB account, [get your token](get_your_token).

1. Save your token in the environment variable `$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN`:

    ```bash
    export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=your_token_here
    ``` 

1. Save your required repository name in the environment variable `$EDB_REPO`:

    ```bash
    export EDB_REPO=your_repository_name_here
    ```

1. Depending on your operating system, run the appropriate curl command.

    **RHEL/AlmaLinux/RockyLinux/Oracle Linux and SUSE:**
        
    ```bash
    curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_REPO/setup.rpm.sh" | sudo -E bash
    ```

    **Ubuntu/Debian:**

    ```bash
    curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_REPO/setup.deb.sh" | sudo -E bash
    ```

1. You can now install packages from that EDB repository. Move on to [installing named packages](install_named_package) to install the packages you need.

!!! Note
    If you have any issues, see [Troubleshooting](../troubleshooting).
