To set up hosted JFrog Artifactory with EDB repositories, you need to create remote repositories in Artifactory, as described in the procedure that follows. The process is different for on-premises Artifactory.

## Get the base URLs

The process requires that you first get the base URLs to access the EDB repositories.

1. From your EDB account, [get your token](../../getting_started/with_cli/get_your_token).

1. Make a note of your token. For this example, the token is `xyz123`.

1. Select the repository you want to access, for example, `standard`.

1. Your base URL is then formed as:

    ```
    https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/<token>/<repository>/
    ```

    For the `standard` repository with the same token, the base URL is:

    ```
    https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/xyz123/standard/
    ```

1. Append the appropriate path for the repository type. 
   For example, for a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 on x86 architecture, to create the two base URLs, append `rpm/el/9/x86_64/`. Then separately append `rpm/el/9/noarch/` for the `noarch` packages. Using the same example token and repository, the base URLs are:

    ```
    https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/xyz123/standard/rpm/el/9/x86_64/
    https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/xyz123/standard/rpm/el/9/noarch/
    ```

## Set up Artifactory remote repositories

After you have your base URLs, you can create the remote repositories in Artifactory.

Use the Artifactory interface to create the two repositories (`x86_64` and `noarch`), one for each base URL. The `x86_64` repository will contain the `rpm` packages specifically for the `x86_64` architecture. The `noarch` repository will contain the `rpm` packages, which are for any architecture.

Starting with the `x86_64` base URL:

1. Select **Create Repository > Remote**.
1. Select **rpm** as the repository type.
1. Enter a unique name for the repository key, for example, `edb-x86_64`.
1. Enter the `x86_64` base URL, for example,  `https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/xyz123/standard/rpm/el/9/x86_64/`.
1. Select **Create Remote Repository**.

    A prompt to set up the yum client configuration appears. This client configuration is the configuration you use on your local server or VM to access the configured EDB repositories via Artifactory.

1.  On your local RHEL 9 server or VM, create the yum repository file `/etc/yum.repos.d/artifactory-edb.repo`.
    
1.  Add the text generated by Artifactory to the `/etc/yum.repos.d/artifactory-edb.repo` file. The generated text should resemble:
    
    ```
    [Artifactory]
    name=Artifactory
    baseurl=https://username%40domain:{artifactory_token}@username.jfrog.io/artifactory/edb-x86_64/<PATH_TO_REPODATA_FOLDER>
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0
    ```
    
    Remove `<PATH_TO_REPODATA_FOLDER>` from the baseurl. It's not needed.

    Also edit the name to be more descriptive and unique, as there are multiple repositories to add. For example, append `-edb-x86_64` to the name:

    ```
    [Artifactory-edb-x86_64]
    name=Artifactory-edb-x86_64
    baseurl=https://username%40domain:{artifactory_token}@username.jfrog.io/artifactory/edb-x86_64/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0
    ```

    Save the file.
    
1.  Repeat steps 1-7, to create an Artifactory remote repository for the `noarch` repository. After you generate the yum configuration text, add that text to the `/etc/yum.repos.d/artifactory-edb.repo` file you previously created. The file should now contain:

    ```
    [Artifactory-edb-x86_64]
    name=Artifactory-edb-x86_64
    baseurl=username%40domain:{artifactry_token}@username.jfrog.io/artifactory/edb-x86_64/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0
    
    [Artifactory-edb-noarch]
    name=Artifactory-edb-noarch
    baseurl=username%40domain:{artifactry_token}@username.jfrog.io/artifactory/edb-noarch/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0
    ```

## Check that the configuration works

On the local Linux server where the `/etc/yum.repos.d/artifactory-edb.repo` file resides, check that the repository's configuration is correct by running the following command:

```bash
dnf repolist | grep -i Art
```    

A correct configuration produces the following output:

```
Artifactory-edb-noarch                   Artifactory-edb-noarch
Artifactory-edb-x86_64                   Artifactory-edb-x86_64
```
    
This result indicates that the two repositories are configured. 

You can now check for a specific package, such as `postgresextended` in the Artifactory repository, using the `dnf list` command. 

The package name for this example is `edb-postgresextended15-server`, which is EDB Postgres Extended 15. To ensure that you don't get false positives from other repositories, disable all repositories using `--disable-repo=*`, and then enable only the `Artifactory-` prefixed repositories using `--enablerepo=Artifactory-*`:

```bash
dnf list edb-postgresextended15-server --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=Artifactory-*
```

If the repository is configured and working correctly the output resembles:

```

Available Packages
edb-postgresextended15-server.x86_64                                                                                     15.7-2.el9                                                                                     Artifactory-edb-x86_64
```    

The EDB package `edb-postgresextended15-server` is now available to install from the Artifactory repository.
