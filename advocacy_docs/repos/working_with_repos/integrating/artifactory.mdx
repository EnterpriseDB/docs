To set up JFrog Artifactory with EDB repositories, you need to create remote repositories in Artifactory. This article shows how to use JFrog Artifactory with EDB repositories.

## Get the base URLs

The process is requires a base URLs to access the EDB repositories.

1. From your EDB account, [get your token](../../getting_started/with_cli/get_your_token).

1. Make a note of your token, for our examples, the token will be `xyz123`:

1. Select the repository you want to access, for example, `standard`. :

1. Your base URL will is then formed as:

    ```
    https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/<token>/<repository>/"
    ```

    For the `standard` with our token, the repository, the base URL will be:

    ```
    https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/xyz123/standard/
    ```

1. Append the appropriate path for the repository type. 
   For example, for a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 on x86 architecture, append `rpm/el/9/x86_64/` and seperately append `rpm/el/9/noarch/` for the noarch packages, to create two base URLs. With our example, the base URLs will be:

    ```
    https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/xyz123/standard/rpm/el/9/x86_64/
    https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/xyz123/standard/rpm/el/9/noarch/
    ```

## Setup Artifactory remote repositories

With your base URLs, you can now create the remote repositories in Artifactory.

Use the Artifactory UI to create the 2 repositories (`x86_64` and `noarch`), one for each base URL. The `x86_64` repository will contain the `rpm` packages specifically for the `x86_64` architecture, and the `noarch` repository will contain the `rpm` packages which are for any architecture.

Starting with the `x86_64` base URL:

1. Select **Create Repository** and choose **Remote**.
1. Choose **rpm** as the repository type.
1. Enter a unique name for the repository key, for example, `edb-x86_64`.
1. Fill in the URL as `https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/xyz123/standard/rpm/el/9/x86_64/`.
1. Select **Create Remote Repository**.

At this point, a prompt to setup the `yum` client configuration appears. This client configuration is the configuration you use on your local server or VM to access the configured EDB repositories via Artifactory.

6.  On your local RHEL 9 server or VM create the yum repository file `/etc/yum.repos.d/artifactory-edb.repo`.
    
7.  Add the text generated by Artifactory to the `/etc/yum.repos.d/artifactory-edb.repo` file. The generated text should resemble:
    
    ```
    [Artifactory]
    name=Artifactory
    baseurl=https://username%40domain:{artifactory_token}@username.jfrog.io/artifactory/edb-x86_64/<PATH_TO_REPODATA_FOLDER>
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0
    ```
    
    Remove the `<PATH_TO_REPODATA_FOLDER>` from the baseurl. It's not needed.

    You should also edit the `Atrifactory` name to be more descriptive and unique as there are multiple repositories to add. For example, append `-edb-x86_64` to the name to give:

    ```
    [Artifactory-edb-x86_64]
    name=Artifactory-edb-x86_64
    baseurl=https://username%40domain:{artifactory_token}@username.jfrog.io/artifactory/edb-x86_64/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0
    ```

    Save the file.
    
8.  Repeat the process, steps 1-7, to create an Artifactory remote repository for the `noarch` repository. When you generate the **yum** configuration text, add that text to the `/etc/yum.repos.d/artifactory-edb.repo` file previously created. The file should now contain:

    ```
    [Artifactory-edb-x86_64]
    name=Artifactory-edb-x86_64
    baseurl=username%40domain:{artifactry_token}@username.jfrog.io/artifactory/edb-x86_64/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0
    
    [Artifactory-edb-noarch]
    name=Artifactory-edb-noarch
    baseurl=username%40domain:{artifactry_token}@username.jfrog.io/artifactory/edb-noarch/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0
    ```

## Check the configuration works

On the local Linux server where the `/etc/yum.repos.d/artifactory-edb.repo` file resides, check that the repositories configuration is correct by running the following command:


```bash
dnf repolist | grep -i Art
```    

The output returned should be:

```
Artifactory-edb-noarch                   Artifactory-edb-noarch
Artifactory-edb-x86_64                   Artifactory-edb-x86_64
```
    
As you can see the two repositories are now configured. 

You can now check for a specific package, such as `postgresextended` in the Artifactory repository, using the `dnf list` command. The package name for this example is `edb-postgresextended15-server` which is EDB Postgres Extended 15. To ensure that you don't get false positives from other repositories,  disable all repositories using `--disable-repo=*` and then only enable the `Artifactory-` prefixed repositories using `--enablerepo=Artifactory-*`:

```bash
dnf list edb-postgresextended15-server --disablerepo=* --enablerepo=Artifactory-*
```

If configured and working correctly the output should resemble:

```

edb-postgresextended15-server.x86_64                                                                                     15.7-2.el9                                                                                     Artifactory-edb-x86_64
```    

The EDB package `edb-postgresextended15-server` is now available to install from the Artifactory repository.
