<ForYourInfo>The vast majority of the discussion will focus on features, functionality, and techniques that apply equally to both PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS); however, it will also touch on a couple of features that are only available in EPAS. These will be clearly noted.</ForYourInfo>

In this section, we'll cover the basics of connecting to PostgreSQL from Java. You'll find JDBC and Hibernate mentioned frequently: as these underpin most Java data access strategies, let's take a moment to talk about their history...

In the beginning, there was JDBC, and it was good.

Well; it was better than ODBC, slightly. Serviceable. And it still is. If you're spinning up a simple app or want to create your own data access framework, you'll be happy with JDBC.

But... It requires you to manually adapt your software's strategies for handling data to the way in which a relational database handles data. This can be tedious; frustrating; error-prone. And so Object Relational Mapping (ORM) was created. Hibernate wasn't the first ORM, but it was the first widely-used - and arguably the first *usable* - Java ORM. And it set the benchmark for what came after: build your app, then map its data to the storage system (relational database or other).

Today, the core core ideas of Hibernate are baked into the Java platform via the Java Persistence API. Hibernate itself has matured, and provides fast and flexible tools with which to integrate Java applications with various databases.
