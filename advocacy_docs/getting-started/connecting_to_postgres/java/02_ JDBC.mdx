JDBC is the fundamental database connector framework for Java. To use it to access Postgres, you need a driver: https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download.html - just download it and put the .jar file in your [classpath](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/findingclasses.html) somewhere. For this example, it is convenient to just drop the driver into the directory where you save the class file, but in a more robust project you might wish to install it in a shared location where it could be used by multiple applications.

Recent versions of JDBC will automatically find and load the appropriate driver for a given connection, as long as the driver can be found via classpath.

```java
// save as Example.java
// run with: java Example.java

import java.sql.*;

public class Example
{
   public static void main(String[] args)
   {
      try
      {
         String url = "jdbc:postgresql://javadb:5432/coffee?user=postgres&password=password";
         Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(url);

         Statement st = conn.createStatement();
         ResultSet rs = st.executeQuery("select table_schema, table_name from information_schema.tables");
         while (rs.next()) 
         {
             System.out.format("%s: %s\n", rs.getString(1), rs.getString(2));
         }
         rs.close();
         st.close();
      } 
      catch (SQLException e)
      {
         System.err.println(e);
      }
   }
}
```

Note: EDB's Postgres Advanced Server offers a custom JDBC driver, with extensive Oracle compatibility options - details can be found in the [EDB Postgres Connectors JDBC Guide](/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-connectors/user-guides/jdbc-guide/11.0.3/toc.html)
