The Spring Framework is a collection of libraries, tools and practices aimed at easing the amount of work that needs to be done to write and configure applications built from components. For details, see [Core Technologies](https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/spring-framework-reference/core.html#beans) in the Spring documentation. 

[Spring Data](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data) is a satellite framework which allows the use of various data-access strategies to integrate smoothly into Spring applications. Like Hibernate, its fundamental goal is that of an ORM - mapping data stored in Java objects to some other data storage or transmission system. In fact, the [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jdbc) library can use Hibernate as an intermediary for storage or retrieval, but there are other Spring Data libraries such as [Spring Data JDBC](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jdbc) which impose less overhead and may be a preferable option for applications which do not require the full functionality that Hibernate / JPA provide. 

[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) is a set of tools and libraries which simplify the creation of standalone applications built on the Spring frameworks. Spring's core philosophies of inversion of control allow very flexible application design, but tend to impose a substantial amount of overhead in the code and configuration that must be written; when there are an infinite number of ways to accomplish a task, choosing one can be challenging... Spring Boot takes an "opinionated" approach for common application types, thus reducing the effort needed to get an application running quickly and simplifying the knowledge needed to modify existing applications. 

## Configuration

For both Spring Data JPA and Spring Data JDBC, there is only one essential setting required to connect to Postgres: `spring.datasource.url`. This is usually specified via Spring's `application.properties` configuration file:

```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://host:5432/database?user=username&password=password
```

Username and password can be specified separately, if desired:

```
spring.datasource.username=username
spring.datasource.password=password
```
