(First, [install psycopg2](/getting-started/connecting_to_postgres/python))

Call psycopg2.connect() to open a connection:

```python
import psycopg2

# can also use a standard URL format for the connection string: 
#   psycopg2.connect('postgres://username:password@host:port/database')
with psycopg2.connect(
                    user='username', 
                    password='password', 
                    host='localhost', 
                    port='5432', 
                    dbname='database') as connection:
    connection.autocommit = True

    with connection.cursor() as cursor:
    # list all tables in this database
    cursor.execute('select table_schema, table_name from information_schema.tables')
    results = cursor.fetchall()
    print(results)
```

See [the Psycopg2 documentation for details and other options](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/module.html#psycopg2.connect).
