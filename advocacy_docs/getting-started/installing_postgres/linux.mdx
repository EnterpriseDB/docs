description: Overview and instructions for installing Postgres on Linux-based systems

## Basic installation

You can quickly install Postgres on most Linux systems by configuring your system's package manager to reference the postgresql.org repositories.

Pre-built packages and instructions for most common Linux & Unix systems are available from postgresql.org: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

If you're installing EDB's Postgres Advanced Server, [instructions for Linux & Unix systems can be found on this site](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/installation-getting-started/installation-guide-for-linux/12/toc.html)

### Demonstrations

## Server installation details

A Linux-based Postgres server installation must accomplish the following tasks:

1. Installing the binaries, documentation, and data directory into the filesystem
2. Creating the `postgres` superuser to own the processes and initial [cluster](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/creating-cluster.html)
3. Configuring paths and environmental variables
4. Initializing the default database cluster with a default database (named `postgres`) and default template (`template1`)
5. Configure and start the `postgres` service for the default database cluster

The platform-native installation packages will accomplish all of the above. For additional tools, extensions and libraries (for instance, pgAdmin or PostGIS), additional packages will need to be installed.

## Client-only installation details

A client-only installation, suitable for connecting to an existing server, need only provide client libraries and tools, e.g. psql. If you already have a database server that you intend to use, installing a client package can save a bit of time and disk space. Otherwise, installing the full server package will still provide you the ability to connect to existing servers.

## Development installation details

To develop applications which connect to a Postgres server, you'll need libraries for this purpose. For details, see: [Connecting to Postgres](/getting-started/connecting_to_postgres).
