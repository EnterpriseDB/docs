## Basic installation

You can quickly install Postgres on most Linux systems by configuring your system's package manager to reference the postgresql.org repositories.

Pre-built packages and instructions for most common Linux & Unix systems are available from postgresql.org: https://www.postgresql.org/download/

If you're installing EDB's Postgres Advanced Server, [instructions for Linux & Unix systems can be found on this site](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/installation-getting-started/installation-guide-for-linux/12/toc.html)

## Server installation details

A Linux-based Postgres server installation must accomplish the following tasks:

1. Installing the binaries, documentation, and data directory into the filesystem
2. Creating the `postgres` superuser to own the processes and initial [cluster](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/creating-cluster.html)
3. Configuring paths and environmental variables
4. Initializing the default database cluster with a default database (named `postgres`) and default template (`template1`)
5. Configure and start the `postgres` service for the default database cluster

The platform-native installation packages will accomplish all of the above. For additional tools, extensions and libraries (for instance, pgAdmin or PostGIS), additional packages will need to be installed.

### Live tutorial

This tutorial will walk through the steps for installing a PostgreSQL server on Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS.

First, we need to add the Postgresql.org repository as a source for Ubuntu's APT package manager:

```shell
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'
```

The command `lsb_release -cs` retrieves the name of the installed OS version, in this case "bionic" - this ensures that we're pulling from the correct repository for this release of the operating system. Supported releases can be found on [the PostgreSQL wiki](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt). The resulting [sources file](https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList) looks like this:

> deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ bionic-pgdg main

APT won't trust the new source until we provide it with [a trusted key](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man8/apt-secure.8.html) - we can pull that from postgresql.org and add it with the apt-key utility:

```shell
wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc | sudo apt-key add -
```

With APT configured, we can update the list of packages and install the desired version of PostgreSQL:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install postgresql
```

If you desired a version other than the latest, you'd specify that instead - for instance, `sudo apt-get install postgresql-12`.

When the APT installation completes, you can log in as `postgres`...

```shell
su - postgres
```

...and try it out!

```shell
psql -c "select * from information_schema.tables;"
```

(press `q` to quit the pager if you don't feel like reading all the system tables)

You can also observe the directory structure created as described above:

```shell
ls -R /etc/postgresql/
ls -R /var/lib/postgresql
ls -R /usr/share/postgresql
ls -R /usr/lib/postgresql
ls -R /etc/postgresql-common
```

Aren't you glad you didn't have to worry about all that? APT is a great tool. But if you want to learn more about what's involved in a Postgres installation, peruse [Installation from Source Code](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/installation.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

## Client-only installation details

A client-only installation, suitable for connecting to an existing server, need only provide client libraries and tools, e.g. psql. If you already have a database server that you intend to use, installing a client package can save a bit of time and disk space. Otherwise, installing the full server package will still provide you the ability to connect to existing servers.

## Development installation details

To develop applications which connect to a Postgres server, you'll need libraries for this purpose. For details, see: [Connecting to Postgres](/getting-started/connecting_to_postgres).
