EDB supports a variety of open source projects, including PostgreSQL. All of those projects have vibrant communities all their own, with excellent documentation.

## PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is a powerful, open source object-relational database system that uses and extends the SQL language combined with many features that safely store and scale the most complicated data workloads. The origins of PostgreSQL date back to 1986 as part of the POSTGRES project at the University of California at Berkeley and has more than 30 years of active development on the core platform.

## PostgreSQL tools

PostgreSQL has been around a while, and has been gaining in popularity in recent years. One reason for that is the wide variety of tools that make PostgreSQL work for an ever expanding number of use cases. These are the PostgreSQL Tools supported by EDB:

1. [Pgpool-II](https://www.pgpool.net/): Middleware that works between PostgreSQL servers and a PostgreSQL database client
2. [PostGIS](https://postgis.net/): Spatial database extender for PostgreSQL object-relational database
3. [PgBouncer](https://www.pgbouncer.org/): Lightweight connection pooler for PostgreSQL
4. [Foreign Data Wrappers](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Foreign_data_wrappers): Standardized way of handling access to remote objects from SQL databases
