The Agent is a tool that provides database observability, migration assessment and usage reporting capabilities. Whether you integrate with Hybrid Manager to access its full suite of features, or deploy it standalone for targeted benefits, the Agent adapts to your environment.

## If you are using the Hybrid Manager

Configure the Agent on self-managed deployments that you connect to the Hybrid Manager to: 

-   Add observability and monitoring capabilities for *Postgres* databases through Hybrid Manager. Refer to [Monitoring self-managed deployments](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/) for more information on how to install and configure the agent to collect monitoring data for HM observability.

-   Collect basic usage data of *Postgres* databases to help EDB understand how customers are using our products and facilitate core-based licensing and entitlements. Refer to [Usage reporting for Hybrid Manager connected databases](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/configure_agent/usage_reporting/) for more information on how to enable usage reporting and send data to EDB.

-   Perform a migration assessment for *Oracle* databases through the Hybrid Manager, which provides: 

    -   A summarized view of database schema count, core count, migration complexity, and level of effort. It is available on the [**Migrations** tab](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migrations/) of the **Estate** page.

    -   A [detailed view](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migrations/migration_database_details_view/) with an expanded analysis of **Schemas**, a global and more detailed **Assessment**, as well as a **Migrations** hub that provides direct connections to other tools in the Console that will help you perform migrations.

-   Perform automatic schema extraction for *Oracle* databases through the Hybrid Manager. Refer to the [Oracle to Hybrid Manager](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migration_guides/oracle_to_hm_managed/) migration guide for more information on how to install an configure the agent to collect migration-related data and assessments of Oracle databases.

## If you have a standalone database 

Configure the Agent on self-managed deployments to: 

- Collect basic usage data to help EDB understand how customers are using our products and facilitate core-based licensing and entitlements. Refer to [Usage reporting for standalone databases](/tools/agent/stand_alone/) for more information.
