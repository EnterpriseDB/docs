The Agent is a tool that provides database observability, migration assessment and usage reporting capabilities. Whether you integrate with Hybrid Manager to access its full suite of features, or deploy it stand-alone for targeted benefits, the Agent adapts to your environment.

## If you are using the Hybrid Manager
 
Configure the Agent on self-managed deployments that you connect to the Hybrid Manager to: 

- Add observability and monitoring capabilities for _Postgres_ databases through Hybrid Manager. Refer to [Monitoring self-managed deployments](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/) for more information on how to install and configure the agent to collect monitoring data for HM observability.

- Collect basic usage data of _Postgres_ databases to help EDB understand how customers are using our products and facilitate core-based licensing and entitlements. Refer to [Usage reporting for Hybrid Manager connected databases](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/configure_agent/usage_reporting/) for more information on how to enable usage reporting and send data to EDB.

- Perform a migration assessment and automatic schema extraction for _Oracle_ databases through the Hybrid Manager. Refer to [Using the Agent Oracle Migration Readiness](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migration_guides/agent_for_oracle_readiness/) for more information on how to install an configure the agent to collect migration-related data and assessments of Oracle databases.

## If you have a stand-alone database 

Configure the Agent on self-managed deployments to: 

- Collect basic usage data to help EDB understand how customers are using our products and facilitate core-based licensing and entitlements. Refer to [Usage reporting for stand-alone databases](/tools/agent/stand_alone/) for more information.
