The Agent can provide valuable usage data, helping EDB understand how customers are using our products and facilitating core-based licensing and entitlements. This functionality is available regardless of whether you're using Hybrid Manager (HM) for monitoring or are running an on-premises database server.

Usage reporting with the Agent is an opt-in service. Data is only sent to EDB when you explicitly enable it. When enabled, the agent sends a new report every 12 hours by default, starting with the first time the agent runs.

## What type of data is collected?

When configured to send usage data, the Agent generates a small report containing environment metadata and resource usage. This includes information like:

- Operating system details
- Memory and CPU usage
- Installed database distribution (e.g., PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Extended Server) and version

!!!important
   This report does not include sensitive data or user-identifiable information.

## Where is the data sent to? 

When configured, reporting data goes to `https://pg-usage.enterprisedb.com`, an EDB-managed S3 bucket.

## How do I enable usage reporting with the Agent?

If you are using the Hybrid Manager for centralized observability and monitoring, you can enable reporting as part of your Agent's configuration. See [Enabling usage reporting in HM](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/configure_agent/usage_reporting/). 

If you have a standalone deployment of a database server (PostgreSQL, EPAS, PGE), and you don't wish to use the Hybrid Manager, see [Enabling usage reporting for standalone databases](/tools/agent/stand_alone/).

## How many Agents do I need to track several databases?

### If you are using the Hybrid Manager

The Agent can track multiple databases concurrently. For observability with Hybrid Manager (HM), registering every database in your organization with the Agent is recommended. This approach provides a centralized monitoring hub for all your databases within HM.

While a single Agent instance can track databases across different host machines, this setup provides limited host-level metrics for databases not on the same machine as the Agent. To leverage full host metrics, EDB recommends:

- Deploying one Agent per host machine with self-managed database clusters.
- Configuring a DSN string for each database on that host (this includes setting up DSN string for databases on different database server instances).

### If you have a standalone database

If you are using the Agent only for usage tracking, it is not necessary to configure it to connect to every database in your organization. Since this capability is limited to collecting basic host data, you only need to provide the Agent access to one database per database server instance.

- Deploying one Agent per host machine with self-managed database clusters.
- Configuring a DSN string for only one database per database server instance (not per database).
