The Agent can provide valuable usage data, helping EDB understand how customers are using our products and facilitating core-based licensing and entitlements. This functionality is available regardless of whether you're using Hybrid Manager for monitoring or are running an on-premises database server.

Usage reporting with the Agent is an opt-in service. Data is only sent to EDB when you explicitly enable it. When enabled, the agent sends a new report every 12 hours by default, starting with the first time the agent runs.

## What type of data is collected?

When configured to send usage data, the Agent generates a small report containing environment metadata and resource usage. This includes information like:

- Operating system details
- Memory and CPU usage
- Installed database distribution (e.g., PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Extended Server) and version

!!!important
   This report does not include sensitive data or user-identifiable information.

## Where is the data sent to? 

When configured, reporting data goes to `https://pg-usage.enterprisedb.com`, an EDB-managed S3 bucket.

## How do I enable usage reporting with the Agent?

If you are using the Hybrid Manager for centralized observability and monitoring, you can enable reporting as part of your Agent's configuration. See [Enabling usage reporting in HM](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/configure_agent/usage_reporting/). 

If you have a stand-alone deployment of a database server (PostgreSQL, EPAS, PGE), and you don't wish to use the Hybrid Manager, see [Enabling usage reporting for stand-alone databases](/tools/agent/stand_alone/).
