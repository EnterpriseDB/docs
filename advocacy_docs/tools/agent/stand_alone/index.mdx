For standalone database servers that you don't want to connect to the Hybrid Manager (HM), the Agent still offers a valuable function: usage reporting.

While monitoring and other advanced features are exclusive to the HM integration, the Agent can independently collect and send essential usage data. This allows EDB to better understand how our products are being used.

!!!info Already using the Agent for Hybrid Manager monitoring?
   This page details usage reporting for stand-alone databases (not connected to the Hybrid Manager). If you are already using the Agent for Hybrid Manager observability, and want to additionally report usage to EDB, refer to [Adding usage reporting for Hybrid-Manager monitored databases](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/configure_agent/usage_reporting/).

To configure usage reporting: 

1.  [Create an OS user to run the Agent](sa_agent_os_user).
1.  [Install the Agent](/tools/agent/installing).
1.  [Prepare your database for connection](sa_prepare_database).
1.  Configure and run the agent on [Internet-connected environments](/tools/agent/stand_alone/sa_config_agent_network/) or [air-gapped environments](/tools/agent/stand_alone/sa_config_agent_airgapped/).

Deploy one Agent per host machine with self-managed database clusters. Then, configure a DSN string for only one database per database server instance (not per database). Refer to [How many Agents do I need to track several databases](/tools/agent/usage_reporting/#how-many-agents-do-i-need-to-track-several-databases) for more information.
