For stand-alone database servers, meaning databases not connected to the Hybrid Manager (HM), the Agent offers a valuable function: usage reporting. 

While monitoring and other advanced features are exclusive to the HM integration, the Agent can independently collect and send essential usage data. This allows EDB to better understand how our products are being used.

!!!info
   If you want to enable usage reporting in the scope of Hybrid Manager observability, go to [Enabling usage reporting in Hybrid Manager](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/configure_agent/usage_reporting/).

To configure usage reporting: 

1.  [Create an OS user to run the Agent](sa_agent_os_user).
1.  [Installing the Agent](sa_install_agent).
1.  [Preparing your database for connection](sa_prepare_database).
1.  Configure and run the agent on [Internet-connected environments](/tools/agent/stand_alone/sa_config_agent_network/) or [air-gapped environments](/tools/agent/stand_alone/sa_config_agent_airgapped/).
