When configuring the Agent, you must specify a user that the agent will use to connect to the database.

```sql
CREATE USER agent_user WITH PASSWORD <password>;
```

You must ensure that the agent user can log in to any database:

```sql
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE postgres TO USER agent_user;
```

## Next steps

Configure and run the agent on [Internet-connected environments](/tools/agent/stand_alone/sa_config_agent_network/) or [air-gapped environments](/tools/agent/stand_alone/sa_config_agent_airgapped/).
