For stand-alone database servers, meaning databases not connected to the Hybrid Manager (HM), the Agent offers a valuable function usage reporting. 

While monitoring and other advanced features are exclusive to the HM integration, the Agent can independently collect and send essential usage data. This allows EDB to better understand how our products are being used.
