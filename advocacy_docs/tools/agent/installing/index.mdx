Install the Agent, your go-to tool for database monitoring, usage reporting, and migration assessment. Explore its full capabilities in [Agent](/tools/agent).

## Enable your system to download packages

Enable the system where you are planning on running the agent to download packages from the EDB repositories for EDB Postgres AI.

Locate your EDB subscription token on the [EnterpriseDB repos download page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).

Using the retrieved subscription token, set an environmental variable (`EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN`) to the token's value. Also set an environmental variable for your EDB subscription type (`EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TYPE`) to one of `standard` or `enterprise` depending on which plan you are signed up to:

```shell
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=<your-repos-token>
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TYPE=<your-subscription-type>
```

Depending on your operating system, run the following command to give your system the capacity to download packages from the EDB repositories:

<TabContainer syncKey="platform">
<Tab title="RHEL derivatives">

```shell
curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TYPE/setup.rpm.sh" | sudo -E bash
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="SLES">

```shell
curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TYPE/setup.rpm.sh" | sudo -E bash
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Debian or Ubuntu">

```shell
curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TYPE/setup.deb.sh" | sudo -E bash
```

</Tab>
</TabContainer>

## Install the Agent package

Install the `beacon-agent` package from EDB's repositories:

<TabContainer syncKey="platform">
<Tab title="RHEL derivatives">

```shell
sudo dnf install beacon-agent
```

Or if dnf isn't available:

```shell
sudo yum install beacon-agent
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="SLES">

```shell
sudo zypper install beacon-agent
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Debian or Ubuntu">

```
sudo apt install beacon-agent
```

</Tab>
</TabContainer>

## Install the Agent in air-gapped environments

[Installing in air-gapped environments](/repos/working_with_repos/installing_airgapped/) explains how to leverage [local mirrors](/repos/working_with_repos/building_local_mirrors/) to make a product's packages and dependencies available in environments without internet access.
