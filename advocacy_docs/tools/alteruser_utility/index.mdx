## Overview

The `alteruser` utility modifies an existing role in your EDB Postgres Advanced Server's clusters. It's a wrapper around the SQL command ALTER ROLE and is similar to the `createuser` utility. 

By default, the `alteruser` utility sends the password to the server in plain text, allowing the server to use the password verify function of the assigned password profiles to verify the passwords. It also prompts for the old password if necessary. Use the `--help` option to see all the supported options for modifying user credentials and privileges.

## Synopsis

```
alteruser [OPTION]... [ROLENAME] [CONNSTR]
```

## Options

Provide the options as arguments to the `alteruser` command.

`-c N` or `--connection-limit=N`  

 Sets a maximum number of connections for a role.

`-d` or `--createdb`            

 Assigns the CREATE DATABASE privilege to a role, so it can create databases.

`-D` or `--no-createdb`         

 Removes the CREATE DATABASE privilege from a role, so it can't create databases.

`-i` or `--inherit`             

 Assigns permission to a role to inherit privileges of roles it's a member of.

`-I` or `--no-inherit`          

 Removes permissions from a role to inherit privileges of roles it's a member of.
  
`-l` or `--login`               
 
 Assigns the LOGIN privilege to a role, so it can log in.

`-L` or `--no-login`            

 Removes the LOGIN privilege from a role, so it can't log in.
  
`-P` or `--pwprompt`            

 Assigns a password to a role.
  
`-r` or `--createrole`          

 Assigns the CREATEROLE privilege to a role, so it can create, alter, drop, comment on, and change the security label for other roles.
  
`-R` or `--no-createrole`       

 Removes the CREATEROLE privilege from a role, so it can't create new roles.
  
`-s` or `--superuser`           

 Assigns the SUPERUSER privilege to a role.
  
`-S` or `--no-superuser`        

 Removes the SUPERUSER privilege from a role.
  
`-v` or `--valid-until=TIMESTAMP`
                            
 Sets a date and time after which the role's password is no longer valid.
  
`-V` or `--version`             

 Prints the `alteruser` version information and exits.
  
`--interactive`             

 Prompts for the missing role name and attributes if none are specified on the command line.

`--bypassrls`               

 Allows a role to bypass row-level security (RLS) policy.
  
`--no-bypassrls`            
 
 Disallows a role to bypass row-level security (RLS) policy.
  
`--replication`             

 Assigns REPLICATION privilege to a role, so it can initiate the replication.
  
`--no-replication`          
 
 Removes REPLICATION privilege from a role, so it can't initiate replication.
  
`--account=MODE`            

 Allows a role to change the account mode. The mode can be LOCK or UNLOCK.
  
`--createdblink`            

 Assigns the CREATE DATABASE LINK privilege to a role, so it can create database links.
  
`--no-createdblink`         

 Removes the CREATE DATABASE LINK privilege from a role, so it can't create database links.

`--createpublicdblink`      

 Assigns the CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK privilege to a role, so it can create public database links.

`--no-createpublicdblink`   

 Removes the CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK privilege from a role, so it can't create public database links.
  
`--droppublicdblink`        

 Assigns the DROP PUBLIC DATABASE LINK privilege to a role, so it can drop public database links.

`--no-droppublicdblink`     

 Removes the DROP PUBLIC DATABASE LINK privilege from a role, so it can't drop public database link.
  
`--encrypt-password=METHOD`

 Assigns an encryption method for a password. Use this option with the `--pwprompt` option. The encryption method can be `"scram-sha-256"`, `"md5"`, `"server_encryption"`, or `"plain"` (default). If you select "server_encryption", the password encrypts using the server's `password_encryption` GUC value. If you select `"plain"`, the password isn't encrypted and is sent in plain text.

`--exemptaccesspolicy`      

 Exempts a role from access control (DBMS_RLS) policies.
  
`--no-exemptaccesspolicy`   

 Doesn't exempt a role from access control (DBMS_RLS) policies.
  
`--lock-time=TIMESTAMP`     

 A role's lock time.
  
`--passwordexpireat[=TIMESTAMP]`
                            
 A role's password expiration time. If you don't provide the timestamp value, the current timestamp is used for password expiration.
  
`--passwordsetat=TIMESTAMP`
                            
 A role's password setting time.
  
`--profile=NAME`            

 Assigns the profile to a role.
  
`--rename=ROLENAME`         

 Renames a role. Use the `--rename` option alone, without any other options.
  
`-?` or `--help`                

 Show help about `alteruser` arguments, and exit.


### Connection options

Provide the connection options to connect to a specific cluster where a role is residing. The connection options override the parameters from the connection string.

`-h` or `--host=HOSTNAME`       
 
 Database server host or socket directory.

`-p` or `--port=PORT`           

 Database server port number.

`-U` or `--username=USERNAME`   

 User name to connect as (not the one to alter).

`-w` or `--no-password`         

 Never prompt for password.

`-W` or `--password`            

 Force password prompt.
  
`--dbname=DBNAME`           

 Database to connect.

## CONNSTR

You can provide the database connection parameters in `CONNSTR`. It overrides the passed-in parameters with the values from the `CONNSTR`.

## Examples

This example shows how to alter a role on a localhost server running on port 5444:

```
./alteruser -h localhost -p 5444 -S -D -R joe
```

This example shows how to alter a role on the default database server in interactive mode:

```
./alteruser --interactive joe
__OUTPUT__
Shall the role be a superuser? (y/n) n
Shall the role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) n
Shall the role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n
```
