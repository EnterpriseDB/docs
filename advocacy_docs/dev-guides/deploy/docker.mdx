## Prerequisites

* Docker-compatible OS (macOS, Windows, Linux)

Using Docker for your local PostgreSQL development environment streamlines setup, ensures consistency, and simplifies management. It provides a flexible, isolated, and portable solution that can adapt to various development needs and workflows.

## Preparing Docker

### Install Docker: 

Make sure Docker is installed on your machine or download and install it from [Docker’s official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/).

* macOS: Download and install Docker Desktop from Docker’s official website.  
* Windows: Download and install Docker Desktop from Docker’s official website. Ensure WSL 2 is enabled if using Windows 10 or later.  
* Linux: Install Docker using your distribution’s package manager. For example, on Ubuntu:  

```
sudo apt update  
sudo apt install docker.io  
sudo systemctl start docker  
sudo systemctl enable docker  
sudo usermod -ag docker $USER  
newgrp docker
```


### Pull the PostgreSQL Docker image:

Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to pull the latest PostgreSQL image from Docker Hub:

```
docker pull postgres
```

## Running the PostgreSQL container

Run a new container with the PostgreSQL image using the following command:

```
docker run --name my_postgres -d postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -v my_pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data -p 5432:5432
```

#### `--name my_postgres`

The `--name` flag tells docker to creates a new container named `my_postgres`. 

#### `-d` 

The `-d` flag tells Docker to run the container in detached mode. This means the container runs in the background and does not block the terminal.

#### `postgres`

This is the name of the image to run. Docker uses this name to pull the image from Docker Hub if it is not already present on the local machine.  Note that if we had not pulled it, this command would automatically pull the PostgreSQL image.

#### `-e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword`

The `-e` flag sets an environment variable `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` to `mysecretpassword`. This is used the password for the default `postgres` user. You should use a different password.

#### `-v my_pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data`
Docker uses volumes to persist data in Docker containers. This flag mounts a volume named `my_pgdata` to persist data. 
The data in this case is whatever Postgres writes to the `/var/lib/postgresql/data` directory within the container. 
These writes are persisted outside the container in a docker volume; the command `docker volume inspect my_pgdata` will show you information about that volume. 

#### `-p 5432:5432`

The `-p` flag maps the container’s port 5432 to the host machine’s port 5432. Port 5432 is Postgres's default port for communications. By using this flag, it allows you to access the PostgreSQL database from your host machine.

## Verifying the container is running

To verify that the container is running, use the following command:

```
docker ps
```

This command lists all running containers. You should see the `my_postgres` container listed.

You now have a persistent, locally accessible Postgres database running in a Docker container.
You can now start using it.

## Access PostgreSQL with a client

To access the PostgreSQL database, without any additional tools, you can use the following command to open a PostgreSQL prompt:

```
docker exec \-it my\_postgres psql \-U postgres
```

This logs into the Docker container and runs the `psql` command as the `postgres` user from there.

The `psql` command is a powerful tool for interacting with PostgreSQL databases. You should install it on your local machine to interact with the PostgreSQL database running in the Docker container.

### macOS

You can install the PostgreSQL client using Homebrew:

```
brew install libpq
```

### Windows

Download the PostgreSQL client from the [official website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads).

### Linux

Use your distribution’s package manager to install the PostgreSQL client. For example, on Ubuntu:

```
sudo apt-get install postgresql-client
```

## Connecting other apps

You can also connect other applications to the PostgreSQL database running in the Docker container. You need to provide the following connection details:

* Host: `localhost`
* Port: `5432`
* Username: `postgres`
* Password: (whatever you set it to)
* Database: `postgres`

Or use the connection string:

```
postgresql://postgres:mysecretpassword@localhost:5432/postgres
```

## Verifying data persistence

1. Create a table and insert data.  
   Access the PostgreSQL instance and run the following SQL commands to create a table with columns and insert some data: 

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE employees (  
      id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,  
      first_name VARCHAR(50),  
      last_name VARCHAR(50),  
      email VARCHAR(100),  
      hire_date DATE  
   );  
      INSERT INTO employees (first_name, last_name, email, hire_date) VALUES  
      ('John', 'Doe','john.doe@example.com', '2020-01-15'),  
      ('Jane', 'Smith', 'jane.smith@example.com', '2019-03-22');
   ```

2. Stop and completely remove the container.  
   ```
   docker stop my_postgres  
   docker rm my_postgres
   ```

3. Recreate the container with the same volume.  

   ```
   docker run --name my_postgres -d postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=mysecretpassword -v my_pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data -p 5432:5432
   ```

4. Verify Data Persistence.  
   Access the PostgreSQL instance and check if the data still exists:  
     
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM employees
   ```

  If everything worked as expected, you should see the employee table with the data previously loaded still present.


## Stopping and removing the container

To stop and remove the container, use the following commands:

```
docker stop my_postgres  
docker rm my_postgres
```

## Deleting the volume

To remove the volume containing the database, use the following command (after stopping and removing the container):

```
docker volume rm my_pgdata
```

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you have set up a robust local development environment for PostgreSQL using Docker. This setup ensures data persistence and provides a flexible, isolated, and consistent environment for all of your development needs.
