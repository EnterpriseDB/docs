- Use Markdown "code fences" along with a language hint to demarcate code:

  ~~~markdown
  ```python  
  import psycopg2  
  ```
  ~~~

  produces:

  ```python
  import psycopg2  
  ```
- Avoid very long listings - if most of the code in the listing *isn't* being described in the article text, put it in a repository somewhere and provide a link to it. Then list *just* the code that you're writing about. 

- Try to keep lines short, to avoid horizontal scrolling on average-sized screens. Also, limit your indentation to between 2 and 4 characters when possible.
