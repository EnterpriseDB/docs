Every article here starts with a block of [Frontmatter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/adding-markdown-pages/#frontmatter-for-metadata-in-markdown-files) metadata (YAML format):

```yaml
---
title: #The full title of the article
navTitle: #(optional) 1-2 word title for the navigation sidebar
description: #(optional) summary description for links on the index page
product: #(optional) product the article is about (ex. postgres-advanced-server)
platform: #(optional) the platform which the article is about (ex. ubuntu)
tags: #list of relevant keywords (used for related articles) Ex.
    - postgresql
    - ubuntu
    - psql
    - live-demo
katacodaPages: #(optional) list of Katacoda scenarios linked in the page, Ex.
    - scenario: install-ubuntu
      account: enterprisedb
katacodaPanel: #(optional) definition of the Katacoda scenario to be embedded in the page, Ex.
    account: enterprisedb
    scenario: sandbox
    codelanguages: sql

```

Below the Frontmatter's closing dashes is the MDX (Markdown) formatted text of the article. MDX is based on [CommonMark](https://github.com/mdx-js/specification), which minimizes distracting markup - but JSX components or raw HTML may also be mixed in where needed:

```markdown
## Introduction

Briefly introduce the purpose of the article.
Level 2 headings (##) will be linked in the table of contents
generated automatically for the page.

## Step 1

Get into the *actual* information.

### Subsection

Break up long runs of text into subsections. 
Level 3 headings (###) will *not* appear 
in the table of contents.

## Demo

MDX allows including and referencing React components
as well, which is handy for things like Katacoda embeds:

<!-- button to launch a terminal panel at the bottom of the page 
    and make SQL code blocks executable in it -->
<KatacodaPanel />
<!-- this will create a link to the scenario described in 
    the Frontmatter at the top of this article -->
<KatacodaPageLink scenario="install-ubuntu" />
```

## A note on search engines

Readers may find your article from a search engine. If your article is split into separate pages, keep in mind that readers may view the pages out of order. It might be useful to alert them to important details that previous pages cover. To do so, we recommend using notes at the top of your article where prior context would be useful:

```markdown
!!! note
    Don't forget to [install prerequisite](/link/article) before trying to connect!
```
