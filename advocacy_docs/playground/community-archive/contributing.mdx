*Note: per [Github convention](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors), this content may move this project to a CONTRIBUTING.md file in this project's root directory.*

Got information that'd useful as a part of these docs? A link that's relevant to a topic here? An idea for a demo? Spot something that could be improved? We welcome all contributors!

## Thanks for contributing!

It's folks like you, working together, that make PostgreSQL such a great community to be a part of. We appreciate everyone's effort and time to help us make this documentation project the best that it can be, for people new to PostgreSQL, EDB customers, the good people who support those customers, and anyone else who uses PostgreSQL in anger and with love.

## How can I contribute?

There are lots of ways to contribute, and all of them involve Github. We love Github. For detailed instructions on pulling and building this repository locally, see [Authoring](/community/authoring)

### Fixing problems

Spot a typo? A bug in a code sample? Awkward or misleading phrasing? Submit a correction!

1. Click the "Edit this page" link at the top-right of the page where you spotted the problem. This will take you to GitHub (you may need to log in first).
2. Click the "Fork this project" button to create your own working copy of the docs. GitHub will open the relevant [MDX file](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/writing-pages/) for editing.
3. Make whatever corrections you see fit, then describe the reason for the changes in the text fields at the bottom of the page.
4. Click "Propose changes" - GitHub create a branch containing your change and show you a diff. At this point you can make further changes in your patch branch, or - if the changes are sufficient - submit a pull request for us to review.
5. Click "Create pull request" - GitHub will give you another chance to describe the reason for your changes; once you're satisfied, click "Create pull request" again.
6. We'll be notified of the pull request - if we have any questions or concerns, we'll comment on it, when it looks good we'll merge it in and build out the changes!

### Report bugs

See a problem, but not sure how it should be fixed? [Create an Issue on GitHub!](/community/feedback)

### Share ideas

The best way to share ideas for how we can improve EDB Docs is to use [Github Issues](/community/feedback). Please be open to discussion - the best ideas come from collaboration!

### Share knowledge

Have ideas for improving an existing topic? Maybe some examples to add, a better demonstration of a concept or technique, or corrections & clarifications? You can make a pull request (as described above) using the "Edit this page" link - we'll review your changes & merge them into the live site!

Have ideas for a *new* topic? Awesome! You can use a pull request for that too, but first let's talk about writing...

## Writing topics

You've got the knowledge and expertise to help - let's work together to share that with folks learning PostgreSQL! 

An effective topic reflects the needs of a specific group of people, its "**audience**". As a person progresses in learning and using PostgreSQL, their needs change and so do the topics that they look to for assistance:

- **Starting out:** topics that introduce terminology and foundational concepts
  *Formats:* [Tutorials](/community/contribute/planning/tutorial), [Live Demos](/community/contribute/planning/demo)
- **Digging in:** topics that solve real problems
  *Formats:* [HOWTOs](/community/contribute/planning/guide)
- **Stepping back:** topics that explain how individual tools and concepts fit into the larger system
  *Formats:* [Guides](/community/contribute/planning/guide)
- **Retrieving:** Topics that allow fast retrieval of detailed information on specific syntax, settings, capabilities, workflows.
  *Formats:* Reference documentation, [Guides](/community/contribute/planning/guide)

This is a simplification of course: one might be comfortably familiar with the practical tasks involved in configuring a system while still digging in when it comes to tasks such as querying or scaling; we should never assume that a beginner in one area is a beginner in *all* areas! 

So, **start by identifying your audience**, thinking about *who* you're writing for in addition to *what* you're writing about. These together will determine *how* you write!

Once that's done, 

1. [Plan your article](/community/contribute/planning)
2. [Write it up using Markdown / MDX](/community/contribute/style)
3. [Test it!](/community/contribute/planning/robustness)
4. [Submit a pull request](/community/authoring#how-to-make-changes-and-submit-pull-requests)
