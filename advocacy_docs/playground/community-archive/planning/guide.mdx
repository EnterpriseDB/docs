### Preface: Usage
The distinction in these guides between Guides, [HOWTOs](howto) and [Tutorials](tutorial) is drawn for the benefit of the authors and contributors; readers by and large will not care so long as they get the help they're looking for. Use your knowledge of your target audience to choose the format for your article, and title it according to the information it provides. 

## The goal of a Guide

Provide knowledge gained by experience to the reader, guiding them toward understanding the design and limitations of the system, tool or concept.

A Guide should be written as instructions on how to *think* about a given system, in contrast to a HOWTO or Tutorial which aim to teach the reader how to *use* the system.

## The nature of your target audience

You would write a Guide when your target audience has some hands-on experience with a given tool or platform, and desires a deeper understanding. For example, someone who finds themselves working with PostgreSQL indexes on a regular basis and wishes to gain the ability to intuit their effects on performance might seek out material that explains the purpose of various index types, their design goals, limitations, and contrasting storage requirements. 

## Tips

1. **Structure your outline** to avoid unnecessary backtracking; try to lay out each feature, problem or idea such that it builds on previously-introduced features, problems or ideas. It is easier to retain a narrative than a jumbled collection of ideas.
2. **Identify prerequisites up-front,** provide links to other guides, reference material, HOWTOs, etc. A reader who hasn't yet become proficient in the topic may wish to refer to them first, or in parallel with your article.
3. **Highlight the problem it solves** when introducing a new feature, function or idea. For example, "Range queries can be slow on b-tree indexes; BRIN indexes were created to speed up range query performance while reducing index size". This helps readers more easily recall the information when they most need it!

## Testing

- Build a collection of support questions concerned with the subject of the article, and compare them to the information you've presented:
    1. Is the point of confusion underlying the question addressed in the guide?
    2. Does the guide's language and terminology mirror that of the askers'?
    3. Are the general problems faced by the askers called out in the explanations included in the guide?
    4. Could the guide be cited in answers to the questions without becoming gratuitous?
    Add or adjust explanations to better match what you observe.
- Discuss the guide with support people and other experts in the subject. Adjust recommendations made by the guide to reflect practical concerns. 
- Compare each assertion in the guide to the canonical documentation. Correct any errors or omissions. This becomes increasingly important as the guide ages. 

## Usage

- Reference the Guide from HOWTOs and Tutorials covering the same tools, systems or platforms.
- Include as prerequisite reading for more advanced Guides.
- Reference the Guide when answering support questions.
