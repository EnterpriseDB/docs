<!-- Demo only: add top level section for "building/sql" to illustrate that too -->

## Start with something you want to demonstrate

The Katacoda format is ideal for step-by-step tutorials, but can also be used for demonstrating ad-hoc code or commands.

Write this out in Markdown format, and spend some time testing it out; Katacoda builds can take a long time, you don't want to have to spend a lot of time waiting on them to fix problems!

## Decide on the format

There are two ways of embedding Katacoda: 

1. Panel embeds ([example](/getting-started/installing_postgres/docker)) pop up a console at the bottom of the page, and allow execution of commands embedded within the rest of the page. 
   These allow a lot of flexibility and don't tie you to a strict step-by-step format - anything you want to demo that can be executed in the console can be included anywhere on the page.
2. Multi-pane embeds ([example](/getting-started/connecting_to_postgres/java/02_JDBC)) put the entire Katacoda environment inline on the page. They can thus include the file browser, editor, etc. as-needed.
   Interaction with the rest of the page is not really practical for this format.

The crucial decision here will generally boil down to whether or not you need an editor. Sure, you can use vim in the console... But that adds a certain level of friction for many readers. **So, if you need the reader to edit files, use the multi-pane embed; otherwise, go for the panel embed.**

## Panel embed format

1. [Pull the repository](https://github.com/rocketinsights/edb_docs_advocacy) and create a local working branch

2. Take your Markdown-formatted tutorial and [add the necessary Frontmatter metadata](../style)

3. Add a `katacodaPanel` key to the Frontmatter at the top of the page. The value will be key-value pairs for the account and scenario that will be used, along with the language(s) that will be executed in the terminal:

  ```yaml
  katacodaPanel:
    account: enterprisedb
    scenario: sandbox
    codelanguages: sql
  ```
   The scenario attribute defines the environment that will be used; `sandbox` is a custom PostgreSQL-on-Ubuntu image that Dave put together with the Pagila example database pre-installed, suitable for demonstrating SQL and some management. The property `codelanguages` specifies a comma-separated list of language names: code blocks highlighted in these languages will execute in the terminal when clicked. Specify the highlighting language for a code block next to the opening fence, e.g.

   ~~~
   ```sql
   Select * From films;
   ```
   ~~~

   Note: in some cases, you won't need a scenario, just a base environment (for example, demonstrating installation on Ubuntu needs only an Ubuntu environment). In these cases, omit the `account` property and specify the name of the environment in the `scenario` property. If no `codelanguages` value is specified, then code blocks marked with `shell` will be executable. 

   ```yaml
   # panel defintion suitable for demonstrating shell commands on ubuntu
   katacodaPanel:
     scenario: ubuntu1804
   ```

4. Make sure code blocks are marked with the language represented in them (sql, shell, etc)

5. Add a `<KatacodaPanel>` element - this will render a button that will allow the reader to load Katacoda in the page, based on the definition provided in the page's Frontmatter in step #3:

   ```markdown
   This is an interactive tutorial - you may launch a console
   in your browser to run the examples below.
   <KatacodaPanel />
   ```
   
6. Drop your file (with an mdx extension) in the relevant section of this repository

7. Test locally - see README for local build instructions

8. Commit, push your branch to remote, and create a PR

9. Let the remote branch build, and test that

10. Merge

11. View it live!

## Multi-pane embed format

1. Pull [the Katacoda repository](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/katacoda-scenarios) (for experimentation, you can create your own)

2. Use [the katacoda-cli tool](https://www.katacoda.com/cli) to create a new scenario 

   ```
   katacoda scenario:create
   ```

   Follow the prompts, and refer to the tutorial you started with for the number of steps you'll want.

3. The tool generates a .md file for each step and an `index.json` file to tie them all together: copy each step into its respective .md file, and edit the index.json to give them descriptive names.

   *You can also create custom environments by adding build scripts under the ./environments directory. See [the Katacoda docs](https://www.katacoda.community/custom-environment.html) for details. If using a custom environment, reference it from the backend.imageid value in `index.json`.

4. **Special markup**

   - To make code blocks clickable to execute in the terminal, add `{{execute}}` to the block's closing:

    ~~~
    ```shell
    ls /etc
    ```{{execute}}
    ~~~

   - To allow a code block to be copied to the clipboard, add `{{copy}}` to the blocks

    ~~~
    ```python
    print('hello')
    ```{{copy}}
    ~~~

   - To allow the reader to open a file in the editor, use inline code formatting and add `{{open}}` to the end:

    ~~~
    `index.json`{{open}}
    ~~~

   - To allow the reader copy an entire code block into the editor, replacing its current contents, with a single click... Wrap it in a specially-formatted `<pre>` element:

     ```
     <pre class="file" data-filename="Cheese.java" 
          data-target="replace">

     Cheese.say();

     </pre>
     ```
     Note: to avoid having to escape the contents, ensure there is a blank line at the start and end. If this is unworkable, ensure the contents are HTML-safe (ampersands, less-than signs escaped).

5. Commit changes & push to Katacoda repo

   (then wait for it to build)

6. [Pull the repository](https://github.com/rocketinsights/edb_docs_advocacy) and create a local working branch

7. Create article page (see [Format](../style) for details)

   Add a `kataCodaPages` key in the Frontmatter at the top of the page. The value will be a list of Katacoda scenario names with an associated Katacoda account for each.

   ```yaml
   katacodaPages:
    - scenario: install-ubuntu
      account: enterprisedb
    - scenario: java-jdbc
      account: shog9
   ```

   The scenario name will be used to refer to the scenario later in the page, *and* will be used in the path for the scenario page within the site; for this reason, avoid using the same scenario name across different accounts on the same page (this should never be necessary). 

   Once you've defined the relevant scenarios, you'll link to them within the article text using the `KatacodaPageLink` element:

   ```markdown
   <KatacodaPageLink scenario="java-jdbc"/>
   ```

   Include at least a short into / explanation for the link. A good place to start is the description defined in the scenario itself. Ex:

   > This tutorial demonstrates how to connect to an existing PostgreSQL database from Java using JDBC.

   Name the article with an .mdx extension and put it in the relevant section of this repository

8. Test locally - see README for local build instructions

9. Commit to branch, push and create PR

10. Live!
