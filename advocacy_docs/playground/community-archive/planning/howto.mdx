### Preface: Usage
The distinction in these guides between [Guides](guide), HOWTOs and [Tutorials](tutorial) is drawn for the benefit of the authors and contributors; readers by and large will not care so long as they get the help they're looking for. Use your knowledge of your target audience to choose the format for your article, and title it according to the information it provides. 

There is some small value in *calling* a HOWTO a tutorial, as this is a common search term.

## The goal of a HOWTO article

Walk a reader through the process of accomplishing **a practical task**, the outcome of which is of immediate use to them. A reader may seek out a HOWTO to remind them of the steps needed to complete an infrequently-performed task, or to provide safety when undertaking a complex task which they've never had to take on before. 

The format of a HOWTO is similar to that of a [Tutorial](tutorial), but a tutorial need not produce any useful outcome beyond that of increasing the reader's familiarity with the subject matter.

If you were cooking breakfast, you might refer first to a tutorial to learn how to crack eggs, and then a HOWTO to learn the steps involved in making a crepe.

## The nature of your target audience

You would choose to write a HOWTO when your target audience is already familiar with the platform and terminology, but not the steps involved in the specific task they wish to accomplish.

## Tips

1. **Perform the task yourself:** taking notes on each action you perform, how long it takes you, and the final result. If you find yourself looking up syntax for commands or other references while performing the task, make notes on these resources as well.
2. **Establish prerequisites:** Identify the desired outcome, prerequisite knowledge and estimated time to complete at the start of your article. Provide links to tutorials, guides or other resources for those who may lack the required familiarity with the target platform. 
3. **Record the actions:** each discrete action should be a step in the HOWTO. Keep each step compact so that they're easy to pick out for a distracted reader. 
4. **Describe the steps:** Be succinct, so as not to distract from the action itself. Link to additional reading (reference or [guide](guide)) for actions that may not be familiar to the audience.
5. **Highlight potential errors:** It won't be possible to anticipate *every* error, but when a step is known to fail in common situations, call this out and provide a work-around.
6. **Provide links to additional reading material:** Start with any references you used yourself in #1, add other material you linked from step descriptions.

## Testing

1. Work through the steps yourself, carefully taking no actions that aren't explicit in the article. Make corrections to address any errors or omissions you encounter.
2. Ask a friend or colleague to work through the HOWTO; observe them quietly if possible, noting any friction points, errors, or dead-ends.

In both cases, compare the final result of the test to the result you obtained when you started writing. If there are differences, try to figure out how they arose and adjust the steps as needed.
