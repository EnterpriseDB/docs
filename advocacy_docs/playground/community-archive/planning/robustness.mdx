No matter how useful an article might be when first written, there will be mistakes... And over time, information will become obsolete, inaccurate, or misleading. This is unavoidable - but we can make identifying and fixing problems easier!

## Test all code and commands 

All commands included in an article should be *run*; all code should be compiled and/or run. And the preceding text and code should be sufficient to allow someone else to create an environment in which to run them, successfully. If, at some later date, the code or command no longer runs successfully then it will be obvious that the article must be updated.

## Capture expected output

This is useful anyway: a reader who wishes to know if their command or code executed successfully can compare their results to those in the article. And it serves double-duty for maintenance: if the output changes, then the article is out of date.

For [live demos](demo) there's a third advantage: programmatically verifying that a step has been completed successfully before moving on to the next step.

## Include a link to a repository or project that contains the final, working code

This is primarily relevant for tutorials and HOWTOs: when the goal of the article is to allow the reader to produce a certain result, that result can be produced ahead of time: if it no longer functions, then either the repository is out of date, the article is out of date, or both are out of date.

Make sure to include a README file with the repository or project that links to the article's source, so that both can be updated at once when bugs are identified.

### Verify that the repository can be created from the instructions provided in the article

If you *started* with a test project, and then wrote a tutorial or HOWTO to document the steps required to create that, you should follow the steps in the article. Compare those results to what you started with, and ensure that what you're providing to readers matches what they can reasonably be expected to produce on their own!

## Ask someone else to test

It's hard to see your own blind spots - so ask someone else to test! A friend, co-worker, ideally someone in your target audience... Another set of eyes to help you see what your work looks like to others. If they can't successfully reproduce the results, then either the instructions are incorrect, or could use some clarification.
