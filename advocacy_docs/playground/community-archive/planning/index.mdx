So, you'd like to contribute an article to this repository? That's awesome! Below are a few tips that you might find useful. These are all just guidelines - use what you can, ignore what you cannot; you're here to share your knowledge, and we're here to help you do that!

## Core philosophy

This repository exists to make PostgreSQL easier to learn and use for people from myriad different backgrounds, possessing different levels of knowledge and understanding. Each article assumes a prerequisite level of knowledge and sets out to assist the reader in gaining more - thus allowing them to solve new problems, perform new tasks, and understand more advanced articles.

No one article can or should be equally useful to all people; each of us possesses unique sets of knowledge - you can be an expert in many things and still know nothing about many more. Every article should be written with the goal of [telling *someone* about *something* for the very first time](https://xkcd.com/1053/)!

## Identifying your audience

Every article has an intended audience, a group of 1 or more people that you, the author, wish to help. You probably don't know *everyone* in that group, but you've certainly interacted with at least a few of its members - folks you've worked with, talked with, or assisted in some way. Try to identify them, and keep them firmly in mind while writing; doing so will help you to stay focused, help you to avoid falling into the trap of writing an article that *no actual person needs to read!*

In particular, try to identify:

1. **What your audience needs to know, and why they need it.** What problems does this information allow them to solve? What new tasks will it allow them to perform? Which new opportunities for learning will understand the concepts you present open for them? 
2. **What your audience *already* knows.** There is a limit to how much you can convey in the space of a single article. By identifying the prerequisite knowledge up-front, you can guide readers who lack it to other resources, while providing encouragement to those who already possess the necessary background information that your article will suit them.

Your audience's needs should determine the nature of the article you write. If they're...

- ...Just getting started? [Write a Tutorial](tutorial) or a [Live Demo](demo)
- ...Seeking to perform a specific task? [Write a HOWTO](howto)
- ...Wanting to better understand a tool, system or concept? [Write a Guide](guide)

## Hang on to what you learned

The topic you're presenting was new to you at one point too... You may not remember every struggle you encountered along the way, but at least you may know what you've forgotten and had to look up again while preparing to write! Hang on to that, keep notes on resources you drew on to refresh your memory, new things you learned along the way, and anything that struck you as unexpectedly delightful or interesting - chances are, your readers will appreciate them too.

## Start with an outline

Even if your article seems fairly linear, an outline is useful to quickly present the summary, structure, and a rough idea of length. The system used to present these articles provides an outline in the form of the table of contents, built from the headings used within the document - as illustrated on this very page!

Starting with an outline can also help avoid mistakes, such as omitting important steps or sub-topics. And if you find your outline is growing unwieldy, you may wish to consider breaking it up into multiple articles.

## Create a test project

Whenever possible, the code and instructions presented in an article should be tested - both prior to publication, and regularly thereafter. Few things are more frustrating to a reader than diligently following instructions only to face an error!

Create a project that allows you to test each action described in your article, and use it (or recreate it) regularly as you write and test. For more on testing, see: [Creating and Maintaining a Robust Article](/community/contribute/planning/robustness).

## Keep notes on related and more advanced topics

Your article should not be a dead-end! Keep a list of related topics that you encounter as you write; work links into the text where immediately relevant, or include them in a "Further reading" section at the end of your article.

## Don't let the perfect become the enemy of the good

Every article here, including this one, is a living document: mistakes can be corrected, new information added, obsolete information removed. There's an "Edit this page" button at the top here, and there will be on your article as well - so don't worry about getting it perfect the first time, as you and others will be able to return to it as need-be. What's important is that we're able to work together and help someone learn.
