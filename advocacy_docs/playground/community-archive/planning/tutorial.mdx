### Preface: Usage
The distinction in these guides between [Guides](guide), [HOWTOs](howto) and Tutorials is drawn for the benefit of the authors and contributors; readers by and large will not care so long as they get the help they're looking for. Use your knowledge of your target audience to choose the format for your article, and title it according to the information it provides. 

There is some small value in *calling* a tutorial a tutorial, as this is a common search term.

## The goal of a Tutorial

Walk through the steps needed to accomplish some simple task in a system, introducing core concepts and terms along the way. A reader may seek out a tutorial to gain a basic understanding of a system before delving into more practical or advanced topics. They may even scan through a tutorial when evaluating a product, as a way to gauge the difficulty involved in using it.

Unlike a [HOWTO](howto), the end result of completing a Tutorial need not be of any practical use beyond that of providing the reader familiarity with the system and its terminology. 

Both Tutorials and HOWTOs are rote learning, akin to memorizing multiplication tables, playing scales, or following a recipe in a cookbook. They are a poor way of learning, but for people who are new to a topic they allow the learner to quickly demonstrate basic competency. By providing a foundation on which to build, a good tutorial enables self-learning! 

## The nature of your target audience

You would choose to write a Tutorial when your target audience has little or no past exposure to a given tool or platform and wishes to quickly gain enough familiarity to evaluate or research it.

## Tips

1. **Keep it short:** choose small tasks that can be accomplished in minutes, not hours. Err on the side of simplicity over practicality - remember, the goal is to introduce concepts not necessarily accomplish anything of practical use, though if you can do both so much the better!
2. **Perform the task yourself:** taking notes on each action you perform, how long it takes you, and the final result. If you find yourself looking up syntax for commands or other references while performing the task, make notes on these resources as well.
3. **Minimize the prerequisites** required to work through the tutorial, and note them explicitly at the top along with links to further reading. For example, a tutorial on basic SQL syntax should not require familiarity with `psql` commands or relational algebra, but may require the PostgreSQL client to be installed, a database to be configured, and a working knowledge of the bash shell. 
4. **Walk through the initial setup carefully**, introducing terms and tools as they're used. Always use correct terminology for your subject matter, and link to further information on each term or tool: the reader is here to learn, not to be patronized.
5. **Record the actions:** each logically-connected group of actions should be a step in the Tutorial. For example, a many-to-many relationship might involve creating several tables - include them all in a step so that you're able to explain the concept and the reader is able to associate each action with the term and result.
6. **Describe the steps:** Detail the work to be done before presenting the action. Avoid jargon that is not essential to describing the step, and take time to define new terminology upon first use. Link to additional reading (reference or [guide](guide)) for concepts, terms and actions that may not be familiar to the audience.
7. **Keep it short, but avoid "[lies to children](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie-to-children)"**, or otherwise-inaccurate explanations that will trip them up later; again, do not patronize the reader. In situations where you cannot fully explain a term or concept in a paragraph or two, note that your explanation is an approximation and provide the reader with a link for further study.
8. **Provide links to additional reading material:** Start with any references you used yourself in #1, add other material you linked from step descriptions.

## Testing

- Walk through the steps yourself, doing NOTHING that isn't spelled out as an action in the Tutorial. Make note of any errors or omissions and correct them.
- Skip steps or actions and note the resulting errors; if the cause isn't obvious, consider adding a note to the subsequent step that will allow the reader to recognize the error if they encounter it.
- Ask a friend or colleague to work through the Tutorial, ideally someone in your target audience. Observe them quietly if possible, and note all mistakes or errors encountered. Revise the steps to mitigate such errors.

In all cases, compare the final result of the test to the result you obtained when you started writing. If there are differences, try to figure out how they arose and adjust the steps as needed.

## Usage

- Tutorials can be a good starting point: reference them on introductory pages, and ensure they can be found by search engines.
- Link to Tutorials from articles on related topics - start with any guides or tutorials you included in your "Further reading" section.
