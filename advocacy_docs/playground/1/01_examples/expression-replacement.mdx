This functionality allows for writing documentation when the future (or current) name of a product is subject to change. It is based on the metadata in `src/constants/products.js` combined with product names and versions (defined via either filesystem or frontmatter) and allows multiple forms of a product name as well as transformations of semantic version numbers. 

## Example products.js data definition

```javascript
"Expression Replacement": {
  name: "Name and Version Expression Replacement Syntax",
  shortName: "Expression Replacement",
  abbreviation: "ExpRel",
  commonCommandName: "{{name().type}}",
}
```

## Examples of invocation

## Scope of {{name(Expression Replacement).short}}

Expressions should be parsed in all Markdown elements containing rendered content, including code blocks and inline code. Frontmatter-sourced version information is not currently available in code. 

Replacements in headings and code (inline and block) are currently limited as follows:

- version replacement cannot use frontmatter-sourced "precise" version or frontmatter-sourced product shortcode to determine context
- product replacement cannot use frontmatter-sourced product shortcode 

This effectively means that subsitution will not function in these contexts for "non-versioned" products unless the product shortcode is specified explicitly. E.g., `\{{name(product).ln}}`

Additionally, expressions will be replaced in certain frontmatter-defined values; initially, these include "title", "navTitle", "description" and "displayBanner".
