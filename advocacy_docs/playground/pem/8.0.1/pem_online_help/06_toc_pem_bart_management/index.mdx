Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) is designed to assist database administrators, system architects, and performance analysts when administering, monitoring, and tuning PostgreSQL and Advanced Server database servers.

The EDB Backup and Recovery Tool (BART) is an administrative utility providing simplified backup and recovery management for multiple local or remote EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL database servers. For more information about BART, please visit the EnterpriseDB website at:

> <https://www.enterprisedb.com/enterprise-postgres/edb-postgres-backup-and-recovery-tool>

From PEM version 7.10 onwards, you can manage a BART server through PEM console. PEM provides a user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your BART server and perform all the BART operations from PEM console.

Before you manage a BART server through PEM console, you must ensure that your system meets certain requirements. For more information, see:

You must add a BART server to the PEM console and then associate that BART server with the database server whose backup you want to manage with BART. For more information, see:

<div class="toctree">

</div>

After you associate the BART server with the database server, you will be able to view the details of the backups in the dashboard. You can perform operations such as scheduling a backup or restoring a backup. For more information, see:
