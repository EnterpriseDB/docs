Use the `Backup Server` dialog to create a plain-text script that will recreate the selected server. You can use the PEM `Query Tool` to play back a plain-text script, and recreate the server.

![Backup Server dialog - General tab](../images/backup_server_general.png)

Use the fields in the `General` tab to specify the following:

-   Enter the name of the backup file in the `Filename` field. Optionally, select the `Browser` icon (ellipsis) to the right to navigate into a directory and select a file that will contain the archive.
-   Use the `Encoding` drop-down listbox to select the character encoding method that should be used for the archive. **Note:** This option is visible only for database server greater than or equal to 11.
-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Role name` to specify a role with connection privileges on the selected server. The role will be used for authentication during the backup.

![Backup Server dialog - Dump Options tab - Types of Objects](../images/backup_server_objects.png)

-   Move switches in the **Type of objects** field box to specify details about the type of objects that will be backed up.

    > -   Move the switch next to `Only data` to the `Yes` position to limit the back up to data.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Only schema` to limit the back up to schema-level database objects.

![Backup Server dialog - Dump Options tab - Do not save options](../images/backup_server_do_not_save.png)

-   Move switches in the **Do not save** field box to select the objects that will not be included in the backup.

    > -   Move the switch next to `Owner` to the `Yes` position to exclude commands that set object ownership.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Privilege` to the `Yes` position to exclude commands that create access privileges.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Tablespace` to the `Yes` position to exclude tablespaces.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Unlogged table data` to the `Yes` position to exclude the contents of unlogged tables.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Comments` to the `Yes` position to exclude commands that set the comments. **Note:** This option is visible only for database server greater than or equal to 11.

![Backup Server dialog - Dump Options - Queries options](../images/backup_server_queries.png)

-   Move switches in the **Queries** field box to specify the type of statements that should be included in the backup.

    > -   Move the switch next to `Use Column Inserts` to the `Yes` position to dump the data in the form of INSERT statements and include explicit column names. Please note: this may make restoration from backup slow.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Use Insert commands` to the `Yes` position to dump the data in the form of INSERT statements rather than using a COPY command. Please note: this may make restoration from backup slow.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Include DROP DATABASE statement` to the `Yes` position to include a command in the backup that will drop any existing database object with the same name before recreating the object during a backup.

![Backup Server dialog - Dump Options tab - Disable options](../images/backup_server_disable.png)

-   Move switches in the **Disable** field box to specify the type of statements that should be excluded from the backup.

    > -   Move the switch next to `Trigger` (active when creating a data-only backup) to the `Yes` position to include commands that will disable triggers on the target table while the data is being loaded.
    > -   Move the switch next to `$ quoting` to the `Yes` position to enable dollar quoting within function bodies; if disabled, the function body will be quoted using SQL standard string syntax.

![Backup Server dialog - Dump Options tab - Miscellaneous options](../images/backup_server_miscellaneous.png)

-   Move switches in the **Miscellaneous** field box to specify miscellaneous backup options.

    > -   Move the switch next to `With OIDs` to the `Yes` position to include object identifiers as part of the table data for each table.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Verbose messages` to the `No` position to instruct `pg_dump` to exclude verbose messages.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Force double quotes on identifiers` to the `Yes` position to force the quoting of all identifiers.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Use SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION` to the `Yes` position to include a statement that will use a SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION command to determine object ownership (instead of an ALTER OWNER command).

Click the `Backup` button to build and execute a command based on your selections; click the `Cancel` button to exit without saving work.

![Backup Server dialog - Success Notification popup](../images/backup_server_messages.png)

Use the **Stop Process** button to stop the Backup process.

If the backup is successful, a popup window will confirm success. Click `Click here for details` on the popup window to launch the `Process Watcher`. The `Process Watcher` logs all the activity associated with the backup and provides additional information for troubleshooting.

![Backup Server dialog - Process Watcher](../images/backup_server_process_watcher.png)

If the backup is unsuccessful, review the error message returned by the `Process Watcher` to resolve any issue.

!!! Note
    You can click on the ![sm_icon](../images/sm_icon.png) icon in the process watcher window to open the file location in the Storage Manager. You can use the [Storage Manager](05_storage_manager/#storage_manager) to download the backup file on the client machine .
