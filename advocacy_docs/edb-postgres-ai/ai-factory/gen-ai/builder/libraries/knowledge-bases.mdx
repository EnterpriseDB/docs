## Who is this for

Platform users building AI applications with context-aware responses powered by Knowledge Bases.
Typical users include developers, AI architects, data engineers, and business owners managing critical content.

## What you will accomplish

You will learn how to create, view, and manage Knowledge Bases in Gen AI Builder.
Knowledge Bases enable you to organize content from Libraries and make it queryable by AI agents, powering semantic search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Why use Knowledge Bases

- Knowledge Bases enable AI models to access your organization's specific knowledge.
- They provide high-quality, context-rich answers by grounding LLMs in your data.
- They simplify the management and updating of content pipelines through integration with Libraries.

For foundational concepts, see:

- [Knowledge Bases explained](../../../learn/explained/knowledge-bases) <!-- We will generate this explainer -->
- [AI Factory Concepts](../../../learn/explained/ai-factory-concepts)
- [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](../../../learn/explained/rag)
- [Embeddings explained](../../../learn/explained/embeddings)
- [Structures explained](../../../learn/explained/structures)

To see how Knowledge Bases are used within **Hybrid Manager deployments**, visit:

- [Hybrid Manager: Using Gen AI Builder](../../../../../hybrid-manager/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder/index)

## How-to Guides

Use the following guides to configure and manage your Knowledge Bases:

- [Create a Knowledge Base](../how-to/create-knowledge-base)
- [Manage Knowledge Bases](../how-to/manage-knowledge-base)
- [Best practices for Hybrid Knowledge Bases](../how-to/hybrid-kb-best-practices)

Each guide provides:

- Who it is for
- What you will accomplish
- Why to use this approach
- Detailed step-by-step instructions
- Best practices and troubleshooting tips

## Next steps

Once your Knowledge Bases are configured:

- Connect AI agents and applications to your Knowledge Bases using Gen AI Builder.
- Design hybrid Knowledge Bases to combine structured and unstructured data.
- Implement RAG workflows with your Knowledge Bases.
