title: Working with Data Lake in Gen AI Builder
description: Understand what the Data Lake is in Gen AI Builder, why it matters, and how it fits into the AI Factory content pipeline.

## What is the Data Lake

The **Data Lake** is the foundational object storage layer for Gen AI Builder and the AI Factory.
It is where Griptape-powered services store:

- Uploaded files from Data Sources
- Indexed data and embeddings
- Griptape Structures and Tools
- Temporary artifacts used in AI workflows

Without a properly configured Data Lake, core features of Gen AI Builder — including Libraries, Knowledge Bases, and Retrievers — cannot function.

For a deep dive, see: [Data Lake explained](edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/explained/data-lake-explained).

## Why use a dedicated Data Lake

- **Separation of concerns:** Keeps Griptape data isolated from other object storage.
- **Performance:** Enables optimized patterns for AI workloads.
- **Security:** Simplifies permission scoping and CORS configuration.
- **Reliability:** Ensures the AI indexing and retrieval pipelines have guaranteed storage availability.

**Best practice:**
Use a dedicated bucket or container **only for Gen AI Builder / Griptape**.

## When to configure the Data Lake

- When setting up a new Griptape deployment.
- When connecting an external storage backend to Gen AI Builder.
- Before adding Data Sources or creating Knowledge Bases.

**Important:**
The Data Lake must be configured **before using Libraries or Knowledge Bases**.

## How does the Data Lake fit into the content pipeline

The Data Lake supports the entire AI Factory pipeline:

Data Sources → Data Lake → Libraries → Knowledge Bases → Retrievers → Assistants → AI Applications


The Data Lake is the persistent storage backend that powers:

- Data Sources of type **Data Lake**
- Content staging during Library and Knowledge Base creation
- Storage for Griptape Structures and Tools

## Getting started

To configure the Data Lake:

- Provision an object storage bucket (S3-compatible or GCS).
- Configure CORS to enable UI interaction.
- Obtain and provide required credentials to your deployment.

See [Configure the Data Lake](edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/how-to/gen-ai/configure-datalake) for the full step-by-step guide.
