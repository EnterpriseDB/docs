## Overview

Observability Drivers are used by [Observability](../structures/observability.mdx) to send telemetry (metrics and traces) related to the execution of an LLM application. The telemetry can be used to monitor the application and to diagnose and troubleshoot issues. All Observability Drivers implement the following methods:

-   `__enter__()` sets up the Driver.
-   `__exit__()` tears down the Driver.
-   `observe()` wraps all functions and methods marked with the `@observable` decorator. At a bare minimum, implementations call the wrapped function and return its result (a no-op). This enables the Driver to generate telemetry related to the invocation's call arguments, return values, exceptions, latency, etc.

## Observability Drivers

### Gen AI Builder

!!! info

    This driver requires the `drivers-observability-griptape-cloud` [extra](..#installing-optional-dependencies).

The Gen AI Builder Observability Driver instruments `@observable` functions and methods with metrics and traces for use with the Gen AI Builder.

!!! note

    For the Gen AI Builder Observability Driver to function as intended, it must be run from within either a Managed Structure on Gen AI Builder
    or locally via the [Skatepark Emulator](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#skatepark-emulator).

Here is an example of how to use the `GriptapeCloudObservabilityDriver` with the `Observability` context manager to send the telemetry to Gen AI Builder:

```python
from griptape.drivers.observability.griptape_cloud import GriptapeCloudObservabilityDriver
from griptape.observability import Observability
from griptape.rules import Rule
from griptape.structures import Agent

observability_driver = GriptapeCloudObservabilityDriver()

with Observability(observability_driver=observability_driver):
    agent = Agent(rules=[Rule("Output one word")])
    agent.run("Name an animal")

```

### OpenTelemetry

!!! info

    This driver requires the `drivers-observability-opentelemetry` [extra](..#installing-optional-dependencies).

The [OpenTelemetry](https://opentelemetry.io/) Observability Driver instruments `@observable` functions and methods with metrics and traces for use with OpenTelemetry. You must configure a destination for the telemetry by providing a `SpanProcessor` to the Driver.

Here is an example of how to use the `OpenTelemetryObservabilityDriver` with the `Observability` context manager to output the telemetry directly to the console:

```python
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor, ConsoleSpanExporter

from griptape.drivers.observability.open_telemetry import OpenTelemetryObservabilityDriver
from griptape.observability import Observability
from griptape.rules import Rule
from griptape.structures import Agent

observability_driver = OpenTelemetryObservabilityDriver(
    service_name="name-an-animal", span_processor=BatchSpanProcessor(ConsoleSpanExporter())
)

with Observability(observability_driver=observability_driver):
    agent = Agent(rules=[Rule("Output one word")])
    agent.run("Name an animal")

```
