## Overview

Web Search Drivers can be used to search for links from a search query. They are used by [WebSearch](../reference/tools/web_search/tool.mdx) to provide its functionality. All Web Search Drivers implement the following methods:

-   `search()` searches the web and returns a [ListArtifact](../reference/artifacts/list_artifact.mdx) that contains JSON-serializable [TextArtifact](../reference/artifacts/text_artifact.mdx)s with the search results.

You can use Web Search Drivers with [Structures](../structures):

    tools=[WebSearchTool(web_search_driver=DuckDuckGoWebSearchDriver()), PromptSummaryTool(off_prompt=False)],
)

agent.run("Give me some websites with information about AI frameworks.")

## Web Search Drivers

### Google

The [GoogleWebSearchDriver](../reference/drivers/web_search/google_web_search_driver.mdx) uses the [Google Custom Search JSON API](https://developers.google.com/custom-search/v1/reference/rest/v1/cse/list) for web searching.

```python
import os

from griptape.drivers.web_search.google import GoogleWebSearchDriver

driver = GoogleWebSearchDriver(
    api_key=os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"],
    search_id=os.environ["GOOGLE_API_SEARCH_ID"],
)

driver.search("griptape ai")

```

### DuckDuckGo

!!! info

    This driver requires the `drivers-web-search-duckduckgo` [extra](..#installing-optional-dependencies).

The [DuckDuckGoWebSearchDriver](../reference/drivers/web_search/duck_duck_go_web_search_driver.mdx) uses the [duckduckgo_search](https://github.com/deedy5/duckduckgo_search) SDK for web searching.

```python
from griptape.drivers.web_search.duck_duck_go import DuckDuckGoWebSearchDriver

driver = DuckDuckGoWebSearchDriver()

driver.search("griptape ai")

```

### Tavily

!!! info

    This driver requires the `drivers-web-search-tavily` [extra](..#installing-optional-dependencies), and a Tavily [api key](https://app.tavily.com).

```python
import os

from griptape.drivers.web_search.tavily import TavilyWebSearchDriver

driver = TavilyWebSearchDriver(api_key=os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"])

driver.search("griptape ai")

```

### Exa

!!! info

    This driver requires the `drivers-web-search-exa` [extra](..#installing-optional-dependencies),
    and an Exa [api key](https://dashboard.exa.ai/api-keys)

```python
import os

from griptape.drivers.web_search.exa import ExaWebSearchDriver

The [PerplexityWebSearchDriver](../reference/drivers/web_search/perplexity_web_search_driver.mdx) uses the [Perplexity Prompt Driver](./#perplexity) internally.

!!! info

    This driver requires a Perplexity Sonar [api key](https://www.perplexity.ai/settings/api)

Griptape is a modular Python framework for building AI-powered applications that securely connect to enterprise data and APIs[1][2]. It offers developers the ability to create AI systems that operate across two dimensions: predictability and creativity[2].

## Key Features

- **AI Agent Framework**: Griptape provides clean abstractions for building Gen AI Agents, Systems of Agents, Pipelines, Workflows, and RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) implementations[1].

- **Flexibility**: The framework allows developers to move between predictability and creativity dimensions according to their use case[2].

- **Structures**: Griptape uses structures like sequential pipelines and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) to enforce predictability[2].

- **Tools**: It facilitates creativity by safely prompting LLMs with Griptape Tools that connect to external APIs and data sources[2].

## Griptape Cloud

Griptape Cloud is a platform that extends the capabilities of the Griptape framework:

- **Data Connectors**: Allow users to bring their own data into the cloud for ingestion and transformation[4].

- **Knowledge Bases**: Organize multiple data sources and make them accessible for querying by AI applications[4].

- **Structures**: Custom Python applications powered by LLMs that can be deployed as hosted endpoints[4].

- **Threads**: Enable conversation memory for AI applications[4].

- **Rulesets and Rules**: Shape agent behavior and enhance responses[4].

## Getting Started

1. Install Griptape:
   ```bash
   pip install griptape-all
   ```

2. Set up your OpenAI API key:
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. Create a Python file (e.g., `app.py`) and import necessary modules from Griptape[3].

4. Build your AI application using Griptape's components such as agents, pipelines, and tools[3].

Griptape offers a powerful and flexible way to create AI-driven applications, from simple chatbots to complex multi-agent systems. Its modular approach allows developers to easily integrate custom tools and external resources, enhancing the capabilities of AI agents[3][4].
