Gen AI Builder is a Python framework designed to simplify the development of generative AI applications. It offers a set of straightforward, flexible abstractions for working with areas such as Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and much more.

1.  **Technology-agnostic**: Gen AI Builder is designed to work with any capable LLM, data store, and backend through the abstraction of Drivers.
2.  **Minimal prompt engineering**: It’s much easier to reason about code written in Python, not natural languages. Gen AI Builder aims to default to Python in most cases unless absolutely necessary.

## Why Consider a Framework?

If you're just beginning to experiment with generative AI, it's often best to start by building simple applications from scratch. However, as your project grows in complexity, a framework like Gen AI Builder can provide structure and best practices that help you maintain clarity and scalability.

Gen AI Builder strives to be transparent about the underlying AI techniques it uses. Nevertheless, having some foundational knowledge of LLMs and related technology will be helpful when building more sophisticated applications.

## Prerequisites

### 1. OpenAI API Key

By default, Gen AI Builder uses [OpenAI](https://openai.com/) for LLM interactions. We’ll learn how to change this via [Prompt Drivers](drivers) later. For now:

1.  Obtain an [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).
2.  Set it as an environment variable:
    ```bash
    export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-api-key"
    ```

!!! info

    Drivers are a primary building block of Gen AI Builder and Prompt Drivers handle all the details when prompting the model with input.

    Prompt Drivers are model agnostic, letting you switch out LLM providers without changing application code.

!!! tip

    To securely and easily manage environment variables, check out tools like [python-dotenv](https://pypi.org/project/python-dotenv/) or [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/environments/).

### 2. Install Gen AI Builder

Gen AI Builder can be installed via multiple methods. Below are two popular approaches:

#### Using Uv

[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) is a fast, user-friendly dependency manager. If you've used [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), `uv` is a similar project but with a focus on simplicity and speed.

1.  [Install `uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

2.  Initialize a new project:

    ```bash
    uv init griptape-quickstart
    ```

3.  Change into the new directory:

    ```bash
    cd griptape-quickstart
    ```

4.  Add Gen AI Builder as a dependency:

    ```bash
    uv add "griptape[all]"
    ```

5.  A [virtual environment](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/pip/environments/#python-environments) will be automatically created. Activate it:

    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

    !!! note

        If you use another shell (like `fish`), this command may differ.

    !!! tip

        If you’re using [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/), you can configure it to automatically [activate your virtual environment](https://mise.jdx.dev/lang/python.html#automatic-virtualenv-activation).

#### Using Pip

If `uv` isn’t your style, you can always install Gen AI Builder using `pip`:

```bash
pip install "griptape[all]" -U
```

#### Installing Optional Dependencies

Gen AI Builder provides optional dependencies that enable specific features and third-party integrations. If you're new to Gen AI Builder, consider installing `[all]` to unlock its full functionality. This ensures you have everything you need right from the start.

However, for a more streamlined setup or if you only need certain features, you have two primary options:

1.  **Core Dependencies**: These provide the minimal, foundational set of libraries for Gen AI Builder to run most default features.

2.  **Optional Dependencies**: These are additional, vendor-specific drivers (e.g., for Anthropic or Pinecone). Any driver requiring an extra will indicate this in the documentation.

For a core-only installation:

```bash
uv add griptape
```

To install specific optional dependencies such as Anthropic and Pinecone drivers—use:

```bash
uv add "griptape[drivers-prompt-anthropic,drivers-vector-pinecone]"
```

To see all available optional dependencies, see Gen AI Builder's [pyproject.toml](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape/blob/050d949ef423287f52c3307b18bc41703a8af953/pyproject.toml#L29).

## Prompt Task

With everything set up, let’s start building! One of Gen AI Builder’s core abstractions is a [Task](structures/tasks.mdx). We'll start with a [Prompt Task](structures/tasks.mdx#prompt-task) to prompt the LLM with some text.

Create a file named `app.py` and add:

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

```python
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask

task = PromptTask()

output = task.run("Hello there!")

print(output)

```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Logs">

```text
[03/13/25 21:07:24] INFO     PromptTask 5430ce6244cb4b379a66e3c6854ad0a6        
                             Input: Hello there!                                
                    INFO     PromptTask 5430ce6244cb4b379a66e3c6854ad0a6        
                             Output: Hello! How can I assist you today?         
Hello! How can I assist you today?

```

</Tab>
</TabContainer>

Then run:

```bash
python app.py
```

!!! tip

    Whenever you see a “Logs” tab in the Gen AI Builder documentation, you can click it to view logs and outputs.

If you got a response from the model, congrats! You’ve created your first generative AI application with Gen AI Builder.
This introductory guide sticks to the [Prompt Task](structures/tasks.mdx#prompt-task), but Gen AI Builder supports a wide range of [Tasks](structures/tasks.mdx). Explore them to see what else you can do.

## Changing Models

!!! info

    This example briefly demonstrates swapping out the underlying model. If you’d prefer to continue using the default OpenAI integration, feel free to skip ahead.

Gen AI Builder’s “Prompt Drivers” make switching model providers simple. For instance, to use [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/), follow the same steps you used for the OpenAI key, but this time set an [Anthropic API key](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys):

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="your-api-key"
```

Then import [Anthropic Prompt Driver](drivers#anthropic) and pass it to your Task:

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

```python
from griptape.drivers.prompt.anthropic import AnthropicPromptDriver
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask

task = PromptTask(prompt_driver=AnthropicPromptDriver(model="claude-3-7-sonnet-latest"))

task.run("Hello there!")

```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Logs">

```text
[03/13/25 21:09:25] INFO     PromptTask e9f1dd403e8b48998d7c42ec9afb5280        
                             Input: Hello there!                                
[03/13/25 21:09:26] INFO     PromptTask e9f1dd403e8b48998d7c42ec9afb5280        
                             Output: Hello! How can I assist you today? I'm here
                             to help with any questions or tasks you might have.
                             Feel free to let me know what you're looking for!  

```

</Tab>
</TabContainer>

Run the script again to see a similar output. Notice you didn’t have to change any of the application-level logic; you only changed the driver.

For the remainder of this guide, we’ll revert to the [OpenAI Chat Prompt Driver](https://docs.griptape.ai/stable/griptape-framework/drivers/prompt-drivers.mdopenai-chat):

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

```python
from griptape.drivers.prompt.openai_chat_prompt_driver import OpenAiChatPromptDriver
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask

task = PromptTask(prompt_driver=OpenAiChatPromptDriver(model="gpt-4.1"))

task.run("Hello there!")

```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Logs">

```text
[03/13/25 21:09:08] INFO     PromptTask 610c07a8855f471cb986eb6ffc8e10c6        
                             Input: Hello there!                                
[03/13/25 21:09:09] INFO     PromptTask 610c07a8855f471cb986eb6ffc8e10c6        
                             Output: Hello! How can I assist you today?         

```

</Tab>
</TabContainer>

If you’d like to keep using Anthropic, be sure to adjust code accordingly.

## Templating

Gen AI Builder uses the popular [Jinja](https://jinja.palletsprojects.com/en/stable/) templating engine to help create dynamic prompts. Let’s adapt our Prompt Task to utilize a Jinja template:

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

```python
from griptape.drivers.prompt.openai_chat_prompt_driver import OpenAiChatPromptDriver
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask

task = PromptTask(
    input="User said: {{ args[0] }}",
    prompt_driver=OpenAiChatPromptDriver(model="gpt-4.1"),
)

task.run("Hi there!")

```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Logs">

```text
[03/13/25 21:07:28] INFO     PromptTask 6583ebd5a8804ec48541f84a92bc1bb3        
                             Input: User said: Hi there!                        
[03/13/25 21:07:29] INFO     PromptTask 6583ebd5a8804ec48541f84a92bc1bb3        
                             Output: Hello! How can I assist you today?         

```

</Tab>
</TabContainer>

Here, `{{ args }}` is rendered at runtime, allowing you to dynamically insert data into the prompt.

!!! info

    `args` is a special attribute added to the Task’s context. Depending on the type of Task, it may also have access to additional context variables.

For static, key-value data, we can add `context` to our Task:

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

```python
from griptape.drivers.prompt.openai_chat_prompt_driver import OpenAiChatPromptDriver
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask

task = PromptTask(
    input="You are speaking to: {{ user_name }}. User said: {{ args[0] }}",
    prompt_driver=OpenAiChatPromptDriver(model="gpt-4.1"),
    context={"user_name": "Collin"},
)

task.run("Hi there!")

```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Logs">

```text
[03/13/25 21:09:46] INFO     PromptTask 26a4dc68df1b473ebe0a97cbbfb159a7        
                             Input: You are speaking to: Collin. User said: Hi  
                             there!                                             
[03/13/25 21:09:47] INFO     PromptTask 26a4dc68df1b473ebe0a97cbbfb159a7        
                             Output: Hello, Collin! How can I assist you today? 

```

</Tab>
</TabContainer>

These two methods allow you to build more versatile, data-driven prompts. Next, we’ll discuss steering the LLM’s output using Gen AI Builder’s Rule system.

## Rules

LLMs can be unpredictable. Getting them to follow specific instructions can be challenging. Gen AI Builder addresses this by providing [Rules and Rulesets](structures/rulesets.mdx), which offer a structured approach to steering the model’s output.

For example, we can create a simple Rule that gives the LLM a name:

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

```python
from griptape.drivers.prompt.openai_chat_prompt_driver import OpenAiChatPromptDriver
from griptape.rules import Rule
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask

task = PromptTask(
    input="You are speaking to: {{ user_name }}. User said: {{ args[0] }}",
    prompt_driver=OpenAiChatPromptDriver(model="gpt-4.1"),
    context={"user_name": "Collin"},
    rules=[Rule("Your name is Oswald.")],
)

task.run("Hi there, what's your name?")

```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Logs">

```text
[03/13/25 21:07:31] INFO     PromptTask 961d6f88ffff44318ef04ea8deacadee        
                             Input: You are speaking to: Collin. User said: Hi  
                             there, what's your name?                           
                    INFO     PromptTask 961d6f88ffff44318ef04ea8deacadee        
                             Output: Hi Collin, my name is Oswald. How can I    
                             assist you today?                                  

```

</Tab>
</TabContainer>

!!! info

    Rules are placed in the LLM’s [system prompt](https://promptengineering.org/system-prompts-in-large-language-models/), which typically yields the highest likelihood that the model will adhere to them.
    even so, LLMs still sometimes have minds of their own and will not follow Rules 100% of time

!!! tip

    While we typically recommend you stick to Rule-based steering, you can always [override the system prompt](structures/rulesets.mdx#overriding-system-prompts) with a custom one.
    Though pay close attention to the discussed tradeoffs that come with this approach.

Multiple rules can be grouped into `Ruleset`s. Let’s refactor our code to use more than one Ruleset:

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

```python
from griptape.drivers.prompt.openai_chat_prompt_driver import OpenAiChatPromptDriver
from griptape.rules import Rule, Ruleset
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask

task = PromptTask(
    input="You are speaking to: {{ user_name }}. User said: {{ args[0] }}",
    prompt_driver=OpenAiChatPromptDriver(model="gpt-4.1"),
    context={"user_name": "Collin"},
    rulesets=[
        Ruleset(
            name="Backstory",
            rules=[
                Rule("Your name is Oswald."),
            ],
        ),
        Ruleset(
            name="Behavior",
            rules=[
                Rule("Introduce yourself at the start of the conversation."),
            ],
        ),
    ],
)

task.run("Hi there!")

```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Logs">

```text
[03/13/25 21:09:49] INFO     PromptTask 5fdebd5f438b44149ed2cc32c2896335        
                             Input: You are speaking to: Collin. User said: Hi  
                             there!                                             
                    INFO     PromptTask 5fdebd5f438b44149ed2cc32c2896335        
                             Output: Hello Collin! My name is Oswald. How can I 
                             assist you today?                                  

```

</Tab>
</TabContainer>

!!! info

    Providing a `rules` list automatically creates a default `Ruleset`. This is great for getting started, but we recommend explicitly defining `Ruleset`s for more complex applications.

Gen AI Builder also includes a specialized Rule, [JsonSchemaRule](structures/rulesets.mdx#json-schema), which inserts a JSON Schema into the system prompt, ensuring the LLM attempts to return structured, machine-readable data:

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

```python
import json
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, cast

from griptape.drivers.prompt.openai_chat_prompt_driver import OpenAiChatPromptDriver
from griptape.rules import JsonSchemaRule, Rule, Ruleset
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from griptape.artifacts.text_artifact import TextArtifact

task = PromptTask(
    input="You are speaking to: {{ user_name }}. User said: {{ args[0] }}",
    prompt_driver=OpenAiChatPromptDriver(model="gpt-4.1"),
    context={"user_name": "Collin"},
    rulesets=[
        Ruleset(
            name="Backstory",
            rules=[
                Rule("Your name is Oswald."),
            ],
        ),
        Ruleset(
            name="Behavior",
            rules=[
                Rule("Introduce yourself at the start of the conversation."),
            ],
        ),
        Ruleset(
            name="Output Format",
            rules=[
                JsonSchemaRule(
                    {
                        "$schema": "https://json-schema.org/draft/2020-12/schema",
                        "type": "object",
                        "properties": {
                            "answer": {"type": "string"},
                        },
                        "required": ["answer"],
                    }
                )
            ],
        ),

</Tab>
</TabContainer>

!!! note

    The `typing.cast` usage is optional, but helps satisfy our type-checker, [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright). We’re actively working to improve Gen AI Builder’s type hints to avoid clunky casts like this.

Now let’s explore an even more robust way to enforce structured outputs.

## Structured Output

While a `JsonSchemaRule` can encourage the LLM to return structured data, it doesn’t provide guarantees, especially for complex schemas. For stronger enforcement, Gen AI Builder’s Prompt Drivers support [Structured Output](drivers#structured-output).

Structured Output uses the LLM provider’s built-in API features to produce outputs in a well-defined schema. It also simplifies parsing, so you can work directly with Python objects rather than manual JSON parsing.

Let’s update our Task to use Structured Output:

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

```python
from typing import cast

from pydantic import BaseModel

from griptape.drivers.prompt.openai_chat_prompt_driver import OpenAiChatPromptDriver
from griptape.rules import Rule, Ruleset
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask


class Output(BaseModel):
    answer: str


task = PromptTask(
    input="You are speaking to: {{ user_name }}. User said: {{ args[0] }}",
    prompt_driver=OpenAiChatPromptDriver(model="gpt-4.1"),
    context={"user_name": "Collin"},
    rulesets=[
        Ruleset(
            name="Backstory",
            rules=[
                Rule("Your name is Oswald."),
            ],
        ),
        Ruleset(
            name="Behavior",
            rules=[
                Rule("Introduce yourself at the start of the conversation."),
            ],
        ),
    ],
    output_schema=Output,
)

task_output_value = cast("Output", task.run("Hi there!").value)

print(task_output_value.answer)

```

Hello Collin! My name is Oswald. How can I assist you today?

```

</Tab>
</TabContainer>

The LLM response is not only formatted correctly, but automatically parsed into a Python object.

!!! tip

    You can use either [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) or [schema](https://github.com/keleshev/schema) to define your schemas. We recommend pydantic for its ease of use.

!!! info

    If your chosen model provider doesn’t natively support structured output, Gen AI Builder employs multiple [fallback strategies](drivers#prompttask). The final fallback is the `JsonSchemaRule`, which you saw earlier.

Now that we can generate structured responses, let’s make our Task more conversational using Gen AI Builder’s memory features.

## Conversation Memory

By default, each LLM call is stateless. If you want the model to recall previous interactions, use [Conversation Memory](structures/conversation-memory.mdx). It tracks Task run history, providing context for the current run.

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel

from griptape.drivers.prompt.openai_chat_prompt_driver import OpenAiChatPromptDriver
from griptape.memory.structure import ConversationMemory
from griptape.rules import Rule, Ruleset
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask


class Output(BaseModel):

!!! tip

    You can customize where the conversation is stored by providing a [Conversation Memory Driver](drivers/conversation-memory-drivers.mdx).

With that set up, the LLM will now remember our previous exchanges. Let’s move on to enabling the model to perform external actions through Tools.

## Tools

LLMs themselves cannot browse the internet or perform external actions. You can enable these abilities via [Tools](tools). A “Tool” is simply a Python class, and any method marked with the `@activity` decorator becomes available to the LLM.

Gen AI Builder comes with a collection of built-in Tools. Below is an example that uses a web search and scrape Tool:

                             flicking the edge of the board with your front foot
                             to make it spin.                                   
                             Jump and keep your body centered over the board,   
                             then catch it with your feet and land smoothly.

!!! info

    Many built-in Tools either provide general-purpose functions (e.g., [CalculatorTool](tools/official-tools#calculator)) or are Driver-based to support exchanging external providers (e.g., [WebSearchTool](tools/official-tools#web-search)).

Tools are a powerful method for extending the LLM’s capabilities. Consider [writing your own Tools](tools/custom-tools) to enable more specialized functionality.

At this point, we have a Task that can handle real-world operations. Now let’s look at orchestrating multiple Tasks.

## Structures

So far, we’ve only worked with individual Tasks. As your app becomes more complex, you may want to organize multiple Tasks that execute in sequence or in parallel.

Gen AI Builder provides three Structures:

-   **Agent**: A lightweight wrapper around a single `PromptTask`. Great for quick usage but still under the hood is just a `PromptTask`.
-   **Pipeline**: Executes Tasks in a specific, linear order.
-   **Workflow**: Creates highly parallel [DAGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph), allowing you to fan out and converge Tasks.

Of the three, `Workflow` is generally the most versatile. `Agent` and `Pipeline` can be handy in certain scenarios but are less frequently needed if you’re comfortable just orchestrating Tasks directly.

Let’s place our `project-research` Task into a `Workflow` so multiple Tasks can run in parallel:

                             ...

                             Litestar is rigorously typed, and it enforces      
                             typing. For example, if you forget to type a return
                             value for a route handler, an exception will be    
                             raised. The reason for this is that Litestar uses  
                             typing data to generate OpenAPI specs, as well as  
                             to validate and parse data. Thus, typing is        
                             essential to the framework.                        
                             Furthermore, Litestar allows extending its support 
                             using plugins.                                     
                             Litestar has a plugin system that allows the user  
                             to extend serialization/deserialization, OpenAPI   
                             generation, and other features.                    
                                                                                
                             It ships with a builtin plugin for SQL Alchemy,    
                             which allows the user to use SQLAlchemy declarative
                             classes "natively" i.e., as type parameters that   
                             will be serialized/deserialized and to return them 
                             as values from route handlers.                     
                             Litestar also supports the programmatic creation of
                             DTOs with a DTOFactory                             
                             class, which also supports the use of              
                             plugins.                                           
                             Litestar has custom logic to generate OpenAPI 3.1.0
                             schema, include optional generation of examples    
                             using the

                             inspired by pytest. You can define named

                             of the application, and then selective use or      
                             overwrite them.

                             to fill the parameters and directly interact with  
                             the API:

                             - The alternative documentation will also reflect  
                             the new query parameter and body:                  
                             In summary, you declare once the types of          
                             parameters, body, etc. as function parameters.     
                             You do that with standard modern Python types.     
                                                                                
                             You don't have to learn a new syntax, the methods  
                             or classes of a specific library, etc.             
                             Just standard Python.                              
                             For example, for an int                            
                             :                                                  
                             item_id: int                                       
                             or for a more complex Item                         
                             model:

                             ...and with that single declaration you get:

!!! warning

    Unlike `PromptTask.run()`, calling `Workflow.run()` returns the `Workflow` instance itself. To see final results, use `Workflow.output`.

!!! info

    Rulesets applied to a Structure are inherited by all child Tasks.

!!! note

    Notice that we've removed the explicit Conversation Memory setup. Structures automatically handle memory for their child Tasks.

A `Workflow` can handle complex branching and merging of Tasks. Next, we’ll look at automatically summarizing large amounts of text with minimal code changes.

!!! info

    Much of Gen AI Builder's current documentation uses Structures. In particular, the `Agent` Structure.
    We are in the process of updating the documentation to include more Task-centric examples.
    Until then, know that an `Agent` is nothing more than a Structure with a single Task, usually a `PromptTask`.

## Engines

Gen AI Builder’s Engines provide higher-level patterns for common generative AI tasks. A typical example is summarizing text that may exceed the LLM’s input limits. Gen AI Builder’s [PromptSummaryEngine](engines/summary-engines.mdx) automatically chunks text and merges the partial summaries into a final result.

\!!! question

```
*Couldn’t we just feed all the text into the LLM and say “summarize”?*

Yes, but LLMs have a token limit. `PromptSummaryEngine` helps you handle text that goes beyond that limit by processing it in smaller parts.

The role of an Engine is to provide you with a higher-level abstraction that simplifies common tasks ([summary](./engines/summary-engines.md), [RAG](./engines/rag-engines.md), [evals](./engines/eval-engines.md), [extraction](./engines/extraction-engines.md)).
```

### Directly Using PromptSummaryEngine

Engines can be used standalone or integrated into Tasks. To illustrate, let’s summarize the outputs of our Workflow:

                             Litestar is rigorously typed, and it enforces      
                             typing. For example, if you forget to type a return
                             value for a route handler, an exception will be    
                             raised. The reason for this is that Litestar uses  
                             typing data to generate OpenAPI specs, as well as  
                             to validate and parse data. Thus, typing is        
                             essential to the framework.                        
                             Furthermore, Litestar allows extending its support 
                             using plugins.                                     
                             Litestar has a plugin system that allows the user  
                             to extend serialization/deserialization, OpenAPI   
                             generation, and other features.                    
                                                                                
                             It ships with a builtin plugin for SQL Alchemy,    
                             which allows the user to use SQLAlchemy declarative
                             classes "natively" i.e., as type parameters that   
                             will be serialized/deserialized and to return them 
                             as values from route handlers.                     
                             Litestar also supports the programmatic creation of
                             DTOs with a DTOFactory                             
                             class, which also supports the use of              
                             plugins.                                           
                             Litestar has custom logic to generate OpenAPI 3.1.0
                             schema, include optional generation of examples

                             with middlewares to handle things such as          
                             - CORS

                             Litestar has an authorization mechanism called

                             , which allows the user to define guard functions

                             etc.) and validate the request before hitting the  
                             route handler

                             Litestar is fast. It is on par with, or

                             In summary, you declare once the types of          
                             parameters, body, etc. as function parameters.     
                             You do that with standard modern Python types.     
                                                                                
                             You don't have to learn a new syntax, the methods  
                             or classes of a specific library, etc.             
                             Just standard Python.                              
                             For example, for an int                            
                             :

                             or for a more complex Item                         
                             model:

                             ...and with that single declaration you get:

This produces a concise summary. But one strength of a Workflow is its ability to fan out and converge results. Let’s remove the direct `PromptSummaryEngine` usage and use a built-in summary Task instead.

### TextSummaryTask

The [TextSummaryTask](structures/tasks.mdx#text-summary-task) leverages the `PromptSummaryEngine` behind the scenes. We’ll have our project-research Tasks converge into one summary Task:

                             Django is a high-level Python web framework that   
                             encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic  
                             design. Built by experienced developers, it takes  
                             care of much of the hassle of web development, so  
                             you can focus on writing your app without needing  
                             to reinvent the wheel. It’s free and open source.

                             Django was designed to help developers take        
                             applications from concept to completion as quickly 
                             as possible.

                             developers avoid many common security mistakes.

                             10K+ developers. Other PDF SDKs promise a lot -    
                             then break. Laggy scrolling, poor mobile UX, tons  
                             of bugs, and lack of support cost you endless      
                             frustrations. Nutrient’s SDK handles billion-page  
                             workloads - so you don’t have to debug PDFs. Used  
                             by ~1 billion end users in more than 150 different 
                             countries.

                             /item?id=42379974)| 2024-12-10Disclaimer: I'm a    
                             co-founder of Hatchet                              
                             (https://github.com/hatchet-dev/hatchet), which is 
                             a Postgres-backed task queue that supports durable 
                             execution.                                         
                             > Because a step transition is just a Postgres     
                             write (~1ms) versus an async dispatch from an      
                             external orchestrator (~100ms), it means DBOS is   
                             25x faster than AWS Step Functions                 
                             Durable execution engines deployed as an external  
                             orchestrator will always been slower than direct DB
                             writes, but the 1ms delay versus ~100ms doesn't    
                             seem inherent to the orchestrator being external.  
                             In the case of Hatchet, pushing work takes ~15ms   
                             and invoking the work takes ~1ms if deployed in the
                             same VPC, and 90% of that execution time is on the 
                             database. In the best-case, the external           
                             orchestrator should take 2x as long to write a step
                             transition (round-trip network call to the         
                             orchestrator + database write), so an ideal        
                             external orchestrator would be ~2ms of latency     
                             here.                                              
                                                                                
                             There are also some tradeoffs to a library-only    
                             mode that aren't discussed. How would work that    
                             requires global coordination between workers behave
                             in this model? Let's say, for example, a global    
                             rate limit -- you'd ideally want to avoid          
                             contention on rate limit rows, assuming they're    
                             stored in Postgres, but each worker attempting to  
                             acquire a rate limit simultaneously would slow down
                             start time significantly (and place additional load
                             on the DB). Whereas with a single external         
                             orchestrator (or leader election), you can         
                             significantly increase throughput by acquiring rate
                             limits as part of a push-based assignment process. 
                             The same problem of coordination arises if many    
                             workers are competing for the same work -- for     
                             example if a machine crashes while doing work, as  
                             described in the article. I'm assuming there's some
                             kind of polling happening which uses FOR UPDATE    
                             SKIP LOCKED, which concerns me as you start to     
                             scale up the number of workers.

                             Litestar is rigorously typed, and it enforces      
                             typing. For example, if you forget to type a return
                             value for a route handler, an exception will be    
                             raised. The reason for this is that Litestar uses  
                             typing data to generate OpenAPI specs, as well as  
                             to validate and parse data. Thus, typing is        
                             essential to the framework.                        
                             Furthermore, Litestar allows extending its support 
                             using plugins.                                     
                             Litestar has a plugin system that allows the user  
                             to extend serialization/deserialization, OpenAPI   
                             generation, and other features.                    
                                                                                
                             It ships with a builtin plugin for SQL Alchemy,    
                             which allows the user to use SQLAlchemy declarative
                             classes "natively" i.e., as type parameters that   
                             will be serialized/deserialized and to return them 
                             as values from route handlers.                     
                             Litestar also supports the programmatic creation of
                             DTOs with a DTOFactory                             
                             class, which also supports the use of              
                             plugins.                                           
                             Litestar has custom logic to generate OpenAPI 3.1.0

                             Litestar has a simple but powerful DI system       
                             inspired by pytest. You can define named           
                             dependencies - sync or async - at different levels 
                             of the application, and then selective use or      
                             overwrite them.

                             Litestar supports typical ASGI middleware and ships
                             with middlewares to handle things such as          
                             - CORS

                             Litestar has an authorization mechanism called

                             , which allows the user to define guard functions

                             etc.) and validate the request before hitting the

                             Litestar supports request life cycle hooks,        
                             similarly to Flask - i.e. before_request           
                                                                                
                             and after_request                                  
                             Litestar is fast. It is on par with, or            
                             significantly faster than comparable ASGI          
                             frameworks.
