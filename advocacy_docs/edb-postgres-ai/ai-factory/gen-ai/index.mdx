**Gen AI Workloads** in **EDB Postgres® AI** (EDB PG AI) enable you to build trusted **AI applications** and intelligent **assistants** — powered by **your data**, running on **your databases and infrastructure**, with full **governance** and **auditability**.

Rather than relying on opaque external APIs, EDB PG AI helps you build **Sovereign AI** solutions — where your intellectual property, data, and AI stack are fully in your control:

- Run assistants, search, and AI APIs over **your Postgres data** and **your knowledge bases**
- Keep embeddings, documents, and models in **your data estate** (Postgres or object storage)
- Build, deploy, and govern **Gen AI apps** on Kubernetes and Hybrid Manager (EDB), or Postgres workloads with the appropriate licensing
- **Audit** and **trace** AI interactions and data flows

## Why Sovereign AI?

Sovereign AI means:

- No lock-in to external APIs
- No sensitive data leaving your data estate
- Full transparency over embeddings, search behavior, and model usage
- Control over where inference happens (on your clusters or governed cloud)

EDB PG AI makes this possible — combining:

- **Postgres-native vector search**
- Flexible **Knowledge Bases** with retrievers
- **Agent Studio** and **Gen AI Builder** to create and manage AI workloads
- Modular pipelines and **AI Accelerator** integrations

This allows you to run **Gen AI Workloads** with **trust** — across Hybrid Manager, on-prem, or licensed EDB workloads.

## Where Gen AI Workloads Run

Currently, **Gen AI Workloads** run within the **Hybrid Manager™** platform from EDB. This provides the underlying architecture for:

- Gen AI Builder
- Pipelines
- Vector Engine
- Agent Studio
- AI model serving and pipelines orchestration

For Hybrid Manager-specific architecture and configuration guidance, see:
[Gen AI Workloads in Hybrid Manager](/hybrid-manager/ai-factory/gen-ai/index.mdx)

EDB Postgres AI offerings are always focused on **Sovereign AI**, with your data estate at the center.

## What You Can Build

With Gen AI Workloads, you can:

- Create **Enterprise Knowledge Assistants** over your Postgres and unstructured data
- Power **RAG-based search portals** across structured + unstructured content
- Provide **Gen AI APIs** over your governed Knowledge Bases
- Run **secure search and similarity retrieval** over sensitive data
- Automate workflows with **intelligent agents** that use your systems
- Drive **composable AI pipelines** from Postgres and object storage

See our [Use Cases](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/use-cases.mdx) and [Solutions](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/solutions.mdx) for detailed patterns.

## Core Components

Explore the components that enable Gen AI Workloads:

### [Agent Studio](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/gen-ai/agent-studio/index.mdx)

Design, deploy, and manage intelligent **Gen AI Assistants**:

- Define assistant behavior with **rulesets**, **tools**, and **retrievers**
- Use **Knowledge Bases** and Pipelines as source data
- Expose assistants via API, chat UI, or internal tools
- Govern behavior and interactions with full auditability

### [Gen AI Builder](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder/index.mdx)

Prepare, govern, and orchestrate your AI knowledge stack:

- Build and manage **Knowledge Bases**
- Define and manage **retrievers** to unify structured and unstructured data
- Connect and manage **Data Lakes** with Pipelines
- Govern data preparation, embedding, and search flow

### [Vector Engine](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/vector-engine/index.mdx)

Extend Postgres with native **vector types** and **similarity search**:

- Store embeddings in Postgres or object storage
- Enable high-performance vector search with full SQL integration
- Drive RAG patterns with full transparency

## Where to Start

To begin building Gen AI Workloads:

- Follow the [AI Factory 101 Learning Path](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/paths/101.mdx)
- Explore the [Explained Concepts](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/explained/index.mdx) — Knowledge Bases, retrievers, Pipelines, and more
- Build your first Assistant in [Agent Studio](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/gen-ai/agent-studio/index.mdx)
- Deploy Knowledge Bases using [Gen AI Builder](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder/index.mdx)
- Try a [Tutorial](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/tutorials/index.mdx) to implement common patterns

## Build Trusted AI with EDB PG AI

EDB Postgres AI lets you deliver **trusted Gen AI Workloads** — built on your data, in your databases, with transparency.

- Use **your models** or models under your governance
- Run in **your environment** — Hybrid Manager (current), with future support for other EDB PG AI workloads
- Keep **your Knowledge Bases** and embeddings in your data estate
- Provide **full auditability** for compliance and trust

**Build intelligent applications — with your data, on your Postgres estate — today.**
