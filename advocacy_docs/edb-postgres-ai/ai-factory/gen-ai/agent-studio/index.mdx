## What is Agent Studio

**Agent Studio** in Gen AI Builder is where you create and manage the key components that bring your AI Factory applications to life.

Agent Studio enables you to:

- Build **Assistants** that interact with users.
- Package **Structures** that perform complex AI workflows.
- Define **Rulesets** to control Assistant behavior.
- Provide **Tools** to extend Assistant and Structure capabilities.
- Manage **Threads** to analyze conversation history and maintain state.

In short:
**Agent Studio is where you assemble, govern, and analyze the intelligent behaviors of your AI-driven applications.**

## Why use Agent Studio

- To create rich, interactive AI applications.
- To apply business logic and organizational rules to AI interactions.
- To integrate AI with external data and systems.
- To ensure controlled, compliant, and high-quality AI behavior.
- To gain visibility into conversations and continuously improve AI performance.

Agent Studio is the **workbench** for designing production-ready AI experiences.

## Core components

### [Assistants](assistants)

**AI agents** that converse with users, powered by LLMs, Knowledge Bases, Tools, Rulesets, and Memory.

Use Assistants to:

- Build chatbots and copilots.
- Implement internal and external virtual agents.
- Connect users with AI-driven business logic.

- Reference (placeholder): `gen-ai/reference/assistants`

---

### [Structures](structures)

**Griptape-powered agents, pipelines, and workflows** that encapsulate business logic for AI-driven tasks.

Use Structures to:

- Perform data transformations.
- Implement multi-step reasoning.
- Provide Tools and Data Source pipelines.

---

### [Rulesets](rulesets)

**Collections of behavioral rules** that guide how Assistants interact with users.

Use Rulesets to:

- Enforce compliance.
- Maintain brand tone.
- Implement conversational policies.

- Reference (placeholder): `gen-ai/reference/rulesets`

---

### [Tools](tools)

**Griptape Tools** that Assistants and Structures can call to perform external actions.

Use Tools to:

- Query APIs.
- Perform calculations.
- Fetch live data.
- Automate workflows.

* Learn more:

- Reference (placeholder): `gen-ai/reference/tools`

---

### [Threads](threads)

**Conversation history and context state** for each interaction with an Assistant.

Use Threads to:

- Audit Assistant behavior.
- Debug conversations.
- Analyze user interaction patterns.
- Manage conversation memory.

* Learn more:
- [Threads explained](edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/explained/threads-explained)
- [View and manage Threads](edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/how-to/gen-ai/view-threads)
