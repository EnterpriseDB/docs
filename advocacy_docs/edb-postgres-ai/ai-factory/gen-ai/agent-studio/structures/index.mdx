description: Build advanced AI workflows with Structures in AI Factory — integrate Tools, retrieval, business logic, and external systems.
---

**Structures** are the building blocks of advanced AI workflows in AI Factory.
They allow you to orchestrate **multi-step pipelines**, integrate **external APIs and systems**, run **data transformations**, and extend Assistants with **custom Tools and logic** — all under your governance.

Structures make it possible to go beyond basic chatbots and build **enterprise-grade AI applications** that combine reasoning, retrieval, action, and compliance.

## Key features of Structures

-   Based on **Griptape Python agents, pipelines, workflows**
-   Deployed from:
-   Data Lake zip file
-   GitHub repository
-   Provided samples
-   Configurable via:
-   Environment variables
-   Structure Config files (YAML / Python)
-   Executable via:
-   PG.AI Web Console
-   API
-   Third-party integrations

At runtime, Structures can run:

-   On demand via UI
-   Programmatically via API
-   Triggered by **Assistant Tools**
-   Embedded in **Data Source transformation pipelines**

## When to use Structures

Use Structures when:

-   You need **multi-step AI reasoning** and workflows
-   You want to call **external APIs** from an Assistant or a pipeline
-   You need to **transform data** at ingest time or pre-indexing
-   You want to implement **custom retrieval logic** beyond basic RAG
-   You want to build **domain-specific AI workflows** that reflect your business logic

Structures power **agentic behavior**, **complex pipelines**, and **production use cases** where advanced control is required.
