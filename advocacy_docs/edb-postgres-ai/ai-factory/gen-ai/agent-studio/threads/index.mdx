## What are Threads

**Threads** in Gen AI Builder represent **individual conversations** or interaction histories, typically with an AI Assistant.
They allow you to review past interactions, understand message flow, and analyze Assistant behavior.

A Thread captures:

- The entire sequence of messages between a user and an AI Assistant.
- Associated metadata (timestamps, IDs, context state).
- System-level details (Tools used, Rulesets applied, memory state).

In short:
**Threads provide the *conversation memory and history* that enables analysis, debugging, and state persistence in your AI Factory applications.**

For a deep dive, see: [Threads explained](../../../learn/explained/threads-explained).

## Why use Threads

- **Review conversation history:** Understand exactly what the user and Assistant said.
- **Debug behavior:** Analyze how Assistants behaved in specific interactions.
- **Analyze user needs:** See patterns of user queries and intents.
- **Support compliance audits:** Provide a record of AI responses.
- **Manage context state:** Track conversation state for Assistants with memory.

Threads are essential for **production-grade AI applications** where quality, compliance, and traceability matter.

## When to use Threads

Use Threads when you need to:

- Review recent interactions for QA or user support.
- Audit Assistant responses for compliance.
- Debug unexpected Assistant behavior.
- Identify points of friction or failure in conversations.
- Analyze common user questions and improve knowledge coverage.
- Manage or reset conversation context for long-running Assistants.

## How Threads fit into Gen AI Builder

```
User Input → Assistant → Retriever → Knowledge Bases → Retrieved Content
→ Rulesets → Behavioral Guidance
→ Tools → Action Execution
→ Memory → Context Maintenance
→ LLM → Response → User Output → Thread recorded
```


Every conversation with an Assistant:

- Creates or continues a **Thread**.
- Records:
- Messages
- Message metadata
- Tool calls and results
- Memory state (if applicable)

## Key features of Threads

- **Conversation history:** Full message log with timestamps.
- **Searchable:** Find Threads by name, alias, or content.
- **Thread metadata:** ID, created/updated times, Assistant association.
- **Message metadata:** Message ID, content, Tool calls.
- **Context state:** Memory and conversation context tracked across turns.
- **QA and debugging:** Inspect message flow and Assistant behavior.

## Typical patterns of use

### Conversation QA

- Review recent Threads to verify tone, accuracy, and compliance.

### Debugging

- Investigate specific user complaints or unexpected behaviors.

### Compliance auditing

- Provide conversation transcripts for audit purposes.

### Memory management

- Track and manage memory state across Threads.

### Conversation analytics

- Identify trends and common user questions across Threads.

## Getting started

See [View and manage Threads](../../../how-to/gen-ai/view-threads) for a full step-by-step guide.

Typical workflow:

1. Navigate to **Threads**.
2. Search or browse to find relevant Thread.
3. Open Thread and review:
- Conversation flow
- Assistant responses
- Tool invocations
- Context state
4. Take action:
- Edit or delete Thread (if needed).
- Export Thread for QA or audit.
- Use findings to improve Assistant configuration.
