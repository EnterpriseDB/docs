A Ruleset can be created to store sets of rules and pull them in dynamically for faster iteration on LLM behavior in a deployed environment. A Ruleset takes a list of Rules. A Ruleset can be given an `alias` so it can be referenced by a user-provided unique identifier:

```bash
export GT_CLOUD_API_KEY=<your API key here>
export ALIAS=<your ruleset alias>
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer ${GT_CLOUD_API_KEY}" "https://<your_hybrid_manager>/launchpad/apps/genai-builder/api/rulesets?alias=${ALIAS}"
```

where <your_hybrid_manager> is your Hybrid Manager Instance URL
