## Vector Engine

**Vector Engine** is part of **EDB Postgres® AI** (EDB PG AI), enabling advanced **vector search** and **hybrid search** capabilities directly in your Postgres databases.

It leverages the open source [PGvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension to provide efficient storage and similarity search for high-dimensional vector data — a foundational capability for **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **semantic search**, and intelligent applications.

**PGvector is an independent extension, maintained by the open source community.** EDB PG AI leverages PGvector as part of its stack:

- [Pipelines](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/pipeline) can automatically populate vector columns using embedding models.
- [Gen AI Builder](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder) and Knowledge Bases use PGvector-backed retrievals.
- You can also use PGvector independently — it is not a proprietary component.

## Why Vector Search in Postgres?

Traditional databases excel at structured data and transactional workloads. AI-powered applications increasingly rely on **vector embeddings** — numeric representations of unstructured content such as text, images, or audio.

Vector Engine enables you to:

- Store vector embeddings in your **Postgres clusters** — no separate vector database required
- Search and retrieve content by similarity, using **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)** indexes
- Combine **vector search + SQL search** for hybrid queries across structured and unstructured data
- Power **Sovereign Gen AI** — keeping embeddings, metadata, and results in your Postgres estate
- Audit and govern AI search and retrieval as part of your Postgres data platform

---

## Who Should Use Vector Engine?

Vector Engine is designed for:

- **Data teams** building RAG pipelines and semantic search on top of Postgres
- **Developers** building Gen AI assistants that integrate with existing Postgres data
- **Analytics teams** augmenting BI and analytics with vector-based search patterns
- **Architects** designing **Sovereign AI** solutions that must govern embeddings and results

If your application uses **vector embeddings** and you want to keep both the vectors and the source data in Postgres — Vector Engine provides a scalable, production-ready path.

## What Does It Provide?

At its core, Vector Engine — using PGvector — adds:

- The `vector` column type — to store high-dimensional vector data
- Distance functions:
- `vector <-> vector` — Euclidean distance (L2)
- `vector <#> vector` — inner product
- `vector <=> vector` — cosine distance
- Support for **Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN)** indexes:
- IVFFlat index type
- Tunable `lists` and `probes` for balancing accuracy vs. speed

**PGvector** itself is open source — EDB PG AI uses it to power:

- Retrieval in Knowledge Bases (via [Gen AI Builder](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder))
- Vector search in Pipelines-based RAG pipelines
- Hybrid AI + SQL query patterns in Postgres

## How Vector Engine Works

1. Install and enable PGvector in your Postgres database:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS vector;
```

1. Define vector columns in your tables:

```sql
ALTER TABLE documents ADD COLUMN embedding vector(768);
```

1. Index vector columns for fast similarity search:

```sql
CREATE INDEX ON documents USING ivfflat (embedding vector_l2_ops) WITH (lists = 100);
```

Use [Pipelines](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/pipeline) to generate embeddings

Or use any external embedding model and insert vectors manually

1. Query using similarity search:

```sql
SELECT id, content
FROM documents
ORDER BY embedding <-> '[0.12, 0.34, 0.56, ...]'::vector
LIMIT 5;
```

## When Should You Use Vector Engine?

Use Vector Engine when:

- You are building Gen AI or AI-powered applications that require grounding in your own data

- You want to perform semantic search across documents, web pages, knowledge bases

- You need a Sovereign AI architecture — embeddings and source data fully inside your Postgres clusters

- You want to support hybrid structured + unstructured search in a unified data platform

- You are developing RAG pipelines using EDB PG AI and AI Accelerator Pipelines


## Example Use Cases

- Enterprise RAG Assistants — combine knowledge base retrieval with LLMs
- Internal semantic search — search corporate content across multiple repositories
- Recommendation systems — similarity search for content or products
- Vision/audio similarity — image or audio embedding search
