**AI Factory Pipelines** is a core capability of **EDB Postgres® AI** (EDB PG AI), enabling intelligent, automated AI data workflows directly in your Postgres clusters — including **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, **Knowledge Bases**, and vector-powered applications.

Pipelines abstracts away complexity in preparing, managing, and serving AI data for Postgres — integrating with **Vector Engine** and enabling **Sovereign AI** patterns where your data stays inside your database or trusted object storage.

## Why Pipelines?

Modern AI workloads — especially RAG and Gen AI — require:

- Clean, preprocessed data
- Consistent embeddings
- Efficient vector indexes
- Real-time updates when source data changes

Manually managing these steps is complex and error-prone. Pipelines automates this lifecycle:

- Prepares and cleans data
- Runs embedding generation
- Maintains vector indexes
- Supports auto-processing and Knowledge Bases

Pipelines helps eliminate "hallucinations" from stale embeddings and makes building reliable Gen AI easier.

## What You Can Do

With Pipelines, you can:

- Automate **vector embedding pipelines** for text and image data
- Maintain **Knowledge Bases** with real-time or batch updates
- Perform **semantic and similarity search** using [Vector Engine](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/vector-engine)
- Integrate with **Gen AI Builder** and other AI Factory components
- Build fully auditable, controlled **Sovereign AI** systems on your data

## How It Works

### Preparers

Preparers define how source data is cleaned, chunked, and prepared for embedding. You can create preparers for:

- Postgres tables (`aidb.create_table_preparer()`)
- Object storage (S3-compatible) (`aidb.create_volume_preparer()`)

Once created, you can run:

- **Bulk processing** (`aidb.bulk_data_preparation()`)
- **Auto-processing** (`aidb.set_auto_preparer()`) to keep embeddings up to date automatically.

See [Preparer Concepts](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/pipeline/preparers) to learn more.

### Knowledge Bases

Knowledge Bases provide a simple abstraction for RAG:

- Define a Knowledge Base (`aidb.create_table_knowledge_base()`, `aidb.create_volume_knowledge_base()`)
- Automatically manage embeddings and vector indexes
- Use `aidb.retrieve_key()` and `aidb.retrieve_text()` for semantic search

Supports:

- Text and image data
- Multi-modal models (e.g., CLIP)
- Integration with Gen AI Builder’s retrieval flows

See [Knowledge Base Concepts](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/pipeline/knowledge_base).

### Auto-Processing

Pipelines supports flexible auto-processing modes:

- Sync or async
- Table or volume sources
- Configurable batch sizes and triggers

See [Auto-Processing](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/pipeline/capabilities/auto-processing.mdx) for details.

## Who Should Use Pipelines?

Pipelines is ideal for:

- Gen AI Builders creating **enterprise Knowledge Bases**
- Data Engineers building **semantic search pipelines**
- AI/ML teams needing **automated RAG pipelines**
- Architects implementing **Sovereign AI** in regulated environments

## When to Use Pipelines

Use Pipelines when you need to:

- Keep embeddings current with changing data
- Reduce RAG errors caused by stale or incomplete embeddings
- Power multi-modal Gen AI search across text and images
- Maintain full auditability and governance of embedding processes
