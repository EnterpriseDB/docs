Pipelines has a Postgres File System (PGFS) extension that allows you to access external storage. In particular, it allows you to store and retrieve files from either a public or private S3-compatible bucket or a local file system. The aidb extension addresses external storage mapped through PGFS as *storage locations* and abstracts away the details of the underlying storage.

PGFS is a key component of Pipelines, allowing you to work with data that isn't stored in the database, either because it's too large or because it isn't structured in a way that's suitable for a relational database.

PGFS is implemented as a foreign data wrapper (FDW) and installed as an extension. The extension provides a set of functions to interact with the file system from the database.


## PGFS storage locations and AIDB volumes
To use a PGFS storage location with AIDB, a `volume` must be created in AIDB:
* **PGFS storage location:** Represents an external storage provider with all necessary configuration like a path and credentials.
* **AIDB volume:** Connects a sotrage location to AIDB. Multiple volumes for the same storage location are possible. In a volume, you configure the data format in the destination and optionally, a sub-path.

## Installing the PGFS extension

See [Installing](../installing) to learn how to install the PGFS extension as part of the Pipelines installation.

## Using PGFS

See the [PGFS management functions](functions) reference for details on the functions available in the PGFS extension.
With these functions you can create and manage storage locations, to be later used through AIDB volumes.
