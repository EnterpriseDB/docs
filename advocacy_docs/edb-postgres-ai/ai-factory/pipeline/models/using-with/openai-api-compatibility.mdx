To make use of an OpenAI-compliant API, you can use the embeddings or completions model providers. A knowledge base needs to encode first, so you can only use the embeddings model provider with a knowledge base.

## Why use an OpenAI-compatible API?

Some examples of why you might want to use an OpenAI-compatible API include:

* If you have a local system running [Ollama](https://ollama.com) and you want that local system to handle embeddings. This assumes you've configured [Ollama as a server](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-do-i-configure-ollama-server).

* If you have access to a service that provides different or specifically tuned models, you can use it instead of other models.

## Creating the model

The starting point for this process is creating a model. When you create a model, you can pass `options` and `credentials` to the registration. The defaults point to the OpenAI service endpoint. By overriding the defaults, you can point to any service.

This example creates a model that uses a local Ollama server:

```sql
select aidb.create_model(
'my_local_ollama',
'embeddings',
'{"model":"llama3.2", "url":"http://llama.local:11434/v1/embeddings"}'::JSONB);
```

### Model name and model provider

The model name is the first parameter. For the example, it's set to `my_local_ollama`.

Specify the model provider as `embeddings`, which is the provider that defaults to using OpenAI servers. You can use the configuration parameter, to override this value to talk to any compliant server.

### Configuration

The next parameter is the configuration. This is a JSON string. When expanded, it has two parameters: the model and the url.

```json
'{"model":"llama3.2", "url":"http://llama.local:11434/v1/embeddings"}'::JSONB
```

In this case, we are setting the model to [“llama3.2”](https://ollama.com/library/llama3.2), a relatively new and powerful model. Remember to run `ollama run llama3.2` to pull and start the model on the server.

The next JSON setting is the important one, overriding the endpoint that the aidb model will use. In this example:

* The server is running on a machine called `llama.local`.
* It has port 11434 (the default port for Ollama) open to service requests over HTTP (not HTTPS in this case).
* The path to the endpoint on the server is `/v1/embeddings`, which is the same as OpenAI.

Putting those components together we get `http://llama.local:11434/v1/embeddings` as our end point.

That completes the configuration parameter.

If the endpoint requires an API key, that would be passed in the credentials parameter. As this is a local model, we don’t need to pass any credentials.

!!!Note Note
When using indexing in pgvector, consider the [pgvector indexing limitations](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector?tab=readme-ov-file#what-if-i-want-to-index-vectors-with-more-than-2000-dimensions). Aidb does not automatically configure an index today but if you add one manually, make sure it supports the number of dimensions your model uses.

## Using the model

Use the model name you created earlier to use the model just like any other Pipelines model. This example shows how to use the model to get an embedding:

```sql
select aidb.encode_text('my_local_ollama','I like it');
```

Pipelines takes care of all the connection management, freeing you to focus on your data and the model results.
