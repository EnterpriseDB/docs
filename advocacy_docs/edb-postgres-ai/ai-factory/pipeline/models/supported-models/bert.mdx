## About BERT

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based model that's used for natural language processing tasks such as text classification, text generation, and text completion. It's pre-trained on a large corpus of text data and is capable of performing a wide range of natural language processing tasks.

Read more about [BERT on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)) and at [Sentence Transformers](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers) on the Hugging Face website.

## Supported aidb operations

* encode_text
* encode_text_batch

## Supported models

* sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (default)

See more in the [Support Matrix](./support_matrix).

## Creating the default model

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model('my_bert_model', 'bert_local');
```

## Creating a specific model

You can specify a model and revision in the options JSONB object. This example creates a `sentence-transformers/all-distilroberta-v1` model with the name `another_bert_model`:

```sql
select aidb.create_model(
  'another_bert_model',
  'bert_local',
  '{"model": "sentence-transformers/all-distilroberta-v1", "revision": "main"}'::JSONB
)
```

## Model configuration settings

The following configuration settings are available for BERT models:

* `model` &mdash; The BERT model to use. The default is `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
* `revision` &mdash; The revision of the model to use. The default is `refs/pr/64`. This entry is a reference to the model revision in the Hugging Face repository. It's used to specify the model version to use, in this case [this branch](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/tree/refs%2Fpr%2F64).

## Model credentials

No credentials are required for the BERT models, as they run locally.
