## About Gemini

Google Gemini is a family of multimodal large language models developed by Google. The models are accessible via the Gemini API.

## Supported aidb operations

* decode_text
* decode_text_batch

## Supported models

Any text generation model that's supported by the provider. See a list of supported Gemini models [here](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models#model-variations)

## Creating a Gemini model

You can create any supported Gemini model using the `aidb.create_model` function.

This example creates a Gemini 2.5 Flash model with the name `my_gemini_model`:

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model(
  'my_gemini_model',
  'gemini',
  '{"model": "gemini-2.5-flash"}'::JSONB,
  '{"api_key": "AIzaSyBXnKr4yJG2lMhyvza81q3-WFuP7Tk3r8z"}'::JSONB 
);
```

## Running the model

```sql
SELECT aidb.decode_text('my_gemini_model', 'Why is the sky blue?');
```

## Model configuration settings

The following configuration settings are available for OpenAI models:

* `model` &mdash; The model to use.
* `url` &mdash; The URL of the model to use. This setting is optional and can be used to specify a custom model URL.  
* `max_concurrent_requests` &mdash; The maximum number of concurrent requests to make to the OpenAI model. The default is `25`.
* `thinking_budget` &mdash; The number of thinking tokens used to generate responses. This setting is optional. See more [here](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/thinking#set-budget).

## Model credentials

The following credentials may be required by the service providing these models.

* `api_key` &mdash; The API key to use for Bearer Token authentication. The api_key is sent in a header field as `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>`.
