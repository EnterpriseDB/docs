# AI Factory

**EDB AI Factory** provides an integrated, scalable platform to build and operationalize AI-powered applications and intelligent data products — all tightly integrated with your Postgres estate.

With AI Factory, you can combine:

- Gen AI agents and conversational applications
- Vector search and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
- Document intelligence and data pipelines
- Scalable model serving and GPU acceleration
- AI-driven database extensions and query patterns

AI Factory helps you build and deploy AI for real-world data and business needs, running on **Hybrid Manager**, **EDB Cloud Service**, or on-prem Kubernetes.

## What You Can Build

AI Factory enables broad solution patterns across industries and internal use cases:

- **Enterprise knowledge assistants** powered by vector search and private data
- **AI-powered search portals** across structured and unstructured data
- **Document processing pipelines** for OCR, summarization, classification
- **Conversational applications** for internal users or customers
- **ML/AI-driven data apps** with model-serving endpoints for search, recommendations, NLP, vision
- **Gen AI APIs** for trusted, governed model access integrated with Postgres
- **Intelligent automation** in internal systems, workflows, and user-facing experiences

See our [Use Cases](/ai-factory/learn/use-cases) and [Industry Solutions](/ai-factory/learn/solutions) for detailed ideas and patterns.

## Build Your AI Factory Solution

We recommend starting with one or more of the following:

- Build your first **Gen AI Assistant** using [Agent Studio](/ai-factory/gen-ai/agent-studio/index.mdx)
- Deploy a **Knowledge Base** using [Gen AI Builder](/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder/index.mdx) and integrate with RAG
- Launch your first **Model Serving InferenceService** with [Model Serving](/ai-factory/model/serving/index.mdx)
- Create **Data Pipelines** for document intelligence with [Pipeline Capabilities](/ai-factory/pipeline/index.mdx)
- Add **Vector Search** to Postgres using [Vector Engine](/ai-factory/vector-engine/index.mdx)

Explore [Use Cases](/ai-factory/learn/use-cases) and [Industry Solutions](/ai-factory/learn/solutions) for end-to-end examples.
