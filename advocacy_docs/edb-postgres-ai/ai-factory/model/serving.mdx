**Model Serving** in **EDB Postgres® AI** (EDB PG AI) enables you to deploy and scale AI model inference services — turning AI models into production-ready APIs and services.

> **Important:** Model Serving requires **Hybrid Manager** and the **Asset Library** to manage model images.
Serving is performed within your Hybrid Manager Kubernetes environment.

## What Is Model Serving?

Model Serving lets you take AI models — including large language models (LLMs), vision models, and embedding models — and deploy them as scalable, observable **Inference Services**:

- In-cluster or on-prem, controlled within your environment
- Integrated with EDB PG AI Pipelines, Knowledge Bases, and Gen AI Builder
- With full control over model lifecycle, scaling, and usage

EDB PG AI Model Serving is powered by the open source **KServe** engine and deeply integrated into Hybrid Manager.

## Why Use Model Serving?

Model Serving provides the backbone for operationalizing AI models:

- **Sovereignty** — Run models on your infrastructure, not external APIs
- **Governance** — Ensure models used in production are trusted and auditable
- **Scalability** — Automatically scale inference services based on load
- **Observability** — Monitor and troubleshoot model serving behavior
- **Integration** — Seamlessly connect Pipelines, Knowledge Bases, and Gen AI assistants to served models

## How It Works

Model Serving works in combination with Hybrid Manager and the Model Library:

- You register model images in the [Asset Library](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/asset-library)
- You create **InferenceServices** via Hybrid Manager or the API
- Hybrid Manager deploys the model as a containerized service using **KServe**
- EDB PG AI components (such as [Pipelines](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/pipeline), [Gen AI Builder](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder), and Knowledge Bases) connect to these InferenceServices at runtime

InferenceServices can support:

- Open **embedding models** for Pipelines and RAG
- Text generation models (LLMs) for Gen AI
- Vision models (CLIP, OCR, image embedding) for multi-modal Knowledge Bases

## When to Use

You should use Model Serving when:

- You want to run your own models, not rely on external API calls
- You need to ensure model inference runs where your data resides (Sovereign AI)
- You want to manage model lifecycle centrally across Pipelines, Knowledge Bases, and assistants
- You need scalable, observable model serving integrated with Hybrid Manager
