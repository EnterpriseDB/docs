title: Data Lake explained
description: Understand the role of the Data Lake in Gen AI Builder and how it supports AI Factory content pipelines.
---

## What is the Data Lake

The **Data Lake** in Gen AI Builder is the foundational object storage layer that supports the entire AI Factory content pipeline.
It provides persistent, scalable storage for:

- Uploaded files from Data Sources
- Indexed data and embeddings used in Libraries and Knowledge Bases
- Griptape Structures and Tools
- Temporary artifacts used in AI workflows

In short:
The Data Lake is where your AI system’s knowledge and operational data live.

## Why is the Data Lake required

Griptape-powered services rely on object storage to function correctly:

- **Data Sources** of type Data Lake store and retrieve files here.
- **Libraries** use the Data Lake to store processed and transformed content.
- **Knowledge Bases** are built from content staged in the Data Lake.
- **Structures and Tools** required by AI Agents and Pipelines are stored in the Data Lake.

Without a Data Lake:

- Data ingestion would fail.
- Libraries and Knowledge Bases could not be built.
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines would be non-functional.
- Structures and Tools would be unavailable to Agents and Assistants.

The Data Lake is a **core dependency** of AI Factory.

## How does the Data Lake fit into the content pipeline

The AI Factory pipeline flows through the Data Lake:

```Data Sources → Data Lake → Libraries → Knowledge Bases → Retrievers → Assistants → AI Applications ```

- **Data Sources** → Files are ingested into the Data Lake.
- **Libraries** → Processed content is staged and indexed via the Data Lake.
- **Knowledge Bases** → Built from the indexed content stored in the Data Lake.
- **Retrievers / Assistants** → Retrieve content ultimately powered by Data Lake-backed pipelines.

## When do you configure the Data Lake

- When deploying a new Griptape / Gen AI Builder instance.
- When connecting an external object storage backend.
- Before adding Data Sources or creating Knowledge Bases.
- Whenever you change your storage provider or bucket.

**Important:** The Data Lake must be configured **before using Libraries or Knowledge Bases**.

## Patterns of use

- **Dedicated bucket:** Best practice is to provision a dedicated object storage bucket solely for Griptape and Gen AI Builder.
- **Isolated permissions:** Object storage credentials should be scoped to this bucket only.
- **CORS configured:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) must be set to allow UI interaction with the Data Lake.
- **S3-compatible:** The Data Lake can be AWS S3, GCS with S3 interoperability, or any other compatible object storage service.

## Best practices

- Use a **dedicated bucket** per Gen AI Builder deployment.
- Follow the **principle of least privilege** for storage credentials.
- Configure **CORS** correctly to enable portal-based interactions.
- Regularly review bucket permissions and audit access.
- Monitor storage utilization and cost.
