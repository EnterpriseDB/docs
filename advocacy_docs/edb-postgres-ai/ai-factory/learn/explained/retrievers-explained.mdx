## What is a Retriever

A **Retriever** in Gen AI Builder is a specialized **Griptape Structure** that defines how an AI Assistant retrieves relevant information from one or more Knowledge Bases at query time.

Retrievers form the core of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines:

- They take the user’s question or Assistant task as input.
- They run semantic and optional structured search across configured Knowledge Bases.
- They return the most relevant "chunks" or documents.
- The Assistant passes this retrieved content to the Large Language Model (LLM) as part of its input context.

**In short:**
Retrievers connect your Assistant to your Knowledge Bases — grounding the AI in your organization’s content.

## Why use Retrievers

- **Ground AI responses:** Prevent hallucination by anchoring responses in trusted, current content.
- **Enable explainability:** Retrieved content can be shown or cited in AI responses.
- **Power multi-KB search:** Assistants can target multiple Knowledge Bases via a single Retriever.
- **Customize retrieval behavior:** Max Tokens, metadata, and Griptape Structure logic enable fine-tuning.

Without Retrievers, Assistants can only rely on their base model knowledge — which is static and cannot reflect your organization's current content.

## How do Retrievers work

Under the hood:

1. User asks a question.
2. Assistant sends this query to its assigned Retriever(s).
3. Retriever (Griptape Structure) runs:
- **Vector search** on unstructured content (using embeddings).
- **Structured filtering** (if Hybrid KB is used and filters are specified).
- **Ranking and selection** of relevant results.
4. Retriever returns results to the Assistant:
- Content is formatted as context for the LLM.
- Optionally, references and metadata can be passed along.
5. Assistant generates its response using the retrieved content.

This entire flow happens **at query time** — ensuring responses reflect the most current content in your Knowledge Bases.

## The role of Griptape Structures

Retrievers are implemented as **Griptape Structures** — making them highly customizable.

The core structure typically defines:

- Query preprocessing logic (if needed)
- Search logic (vector search + filters)
- Result post-processing and formatting
- Optional metadata injection

This architecture allows organizations to:

- Implement custom ranking strategies.
- Apply domain-specific filters.
- Enrich retrieved results with contextual tags.

See [Structures explained](structures) for more on Griptape Structures.

## Tuning and configuration points

### Knowledge Bases selection

- Select one or more Knowledge Bases to target.
- A Retriever can search across **multiple KBs** — useful for broad Assistants.

### Max Tokens

- Controls the total size of content passed to the LLM.
- Tuning guidance:
- Too low → insufficient context for high-quality answers.
- Too high → risk of LLM truncating the prompt or blowing past token limits.
- Typical values: 1000–3000 depending on use case and LLM in use.

### Metadata

- Optional JSON object.
- Use for:
- Internal tracking and versioning
- Configuring advanced search behavior (if supported by your Retriever Structure)
- Passing hints to Assistants

### Filters (Hybrid KB)

- If targeting a Hybrid Knowledge Base, structured filters can be applied (e.g., region, product, price).
- The Retriever Structure must support applying these filters.

## Patterns of use

### Single-KB Retriever

- Simple pattern — target one Knowledge Base.
- Example: `HR Policy Retriever` → queries `HR Policy KB`.

### Multi-KB Retriever

- Targets multiple Knowledge Bases.
- Useful when an Assistant covers broad domains.
- Example: `Support Assistant Retriever` → queries `Product Docs KB`, `Pricing Policies KB`, `Support FAQs KB`.

### Hybrid KB Retriever

- Targets Hybrid Knowledge Base.
- Supports structured filtering + semantic search.
- Example: `Product Catalog Retriever` → allows user to search `Product Catalog Hybrid KB` with filters for `Category`, `Price`, etc.

### Cross-domain Retriever

- Designed for Assistants that switch "personas" or tasks.
- Can be implemented as:
- Single Retriever with dynamic KB selection
- Multiple Retrievers assigned per task or Assistant persona

## Common tuning scenarios

| Goal                                 | Tuning action                  |
|--------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Limit long irrelevant documents      | Tune Max Tokens downward      |
| Retrieve rich multi-paragraph context| Tune Max Tokens upward        |
| Filter by structured fields          | Use Hybrid KB with filters    |
| Improve ranking quality              | Customize Griptape Structure |
| Enable multi-source RAG              | Target multiple Knowledge Bases |
