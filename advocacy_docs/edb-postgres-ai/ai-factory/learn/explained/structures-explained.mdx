## What is a Structure

A **Structure** in Gen AI Builder is a Griptape-powered agent, pipeline, or workflow that encapsulates advanced AI logic and business processes.
Structures are the building blocks that enable you to extend the capabilities of your AI Factory beyond simple conversation.

Structures can:

- Execute **complex AI workflows**.
- Transform data for Data Sources and Knowledge Bases.
- Act as **Tools** for Assistants.
- Implement **custom Data Sources** and **custom Retrievers**.
- Integrate external APIs and systems.

In short:
**Structures bring *custom AI logic* and *integration* to your AI Factory applications.**

Without Structures, your Assistants and RAG pipelines would be limited to basic retrieval + generation.

## Why use Structures

- To define **organization-specific business logic**.
- To enable **multi-step reasoning** and **workflows**.
- To support **task execution** via Tools.
- To enrich and transform incoming data.
- To implement **custom Retrieval** pipelines.
- To integrate AI with **external systems** (APIs, databases, services).

Structures make your AI applications **deeply extensible and production-capable**.

## How Structures work

A Structure is implemented as a Griptape agent, pipeline, or workflow:

- **Griptape agent** → conversational AI logic.
- **Griptape pipeline** → multi-step data transformation.
- **Griptape workflow** → complex orchestration across agents and tools.

Structures are:

- Packaged as Zip files or deployed from GitHub.
- Configured with:
- Structure Config file (YAML / Python)
- Environment variables (API keys, secrets, parameters)
- Executed:
- On demand via the Web Console.
- Programmatically via API.
- As Tools called by Assistants.
- In Data Source pipelines.

## Where Structures fit in the AI Factory pipeline
```Data Sources → Data Lake → Libraries → Knowledge Bases → Retrievers → Assistants
```

Structures can:
- Provide custom Data Sources
- Transform Data Sources
- Act as Tools in Assistants


## When to use Structures

Use Structures when you need:

- Advanced AI capabilities beyond basic chat.
- Data transformations (e.g., parsing documents, summarizing content, enriching data).
- Business workflows (e.g., categorizing transactions, routing requests).
- Task execution (e.g., API calls, system integrations).
- Specialized retrieval and ranking logic.

Typical use cases:

- **Transaction categorization** pipeline.
- **Data anonymization** for privacy.
- **Product catalog enrichment** workflow.
- **API calling agents** that fetch live data.
- **Complex summarization** agents.
- **Custom search** with ranking logic.

## Patterns of use

### Standalone Structure

- Structure is executed on demand via UI or API.
- Example: `Data Anonymizer`

### Structure as a Tool

- Structure is published as a Tool.
- Assistant can call Structure at runtime.
- Example: `Product Inventory Lookup` Tool.

### Structure as Data Transformer

- Structure used in **Data Source pipeline**.
- Transforms incoming data before indexing.
- Example: `PDF Parser + Metadata Enricher`.

### Structure as Custom Data Source

- Structure implements a **custom Retriever** or **custom Data Source**.
- Example: `Real-Time Pricing Retriever`.

## Best practices

- Package Structures cleanly:
- Clear Structure Config.
- Minimal external dependencies.
- Externalize configuration via **environment variables**.
- Implement **robust error handling**.
- Validate that Structures perform well in your production pipeline.
- Use **versioned Data Lake paths** to support Structure versioning.
- Monitor Structure execution performance.
- Follow Griptape best practices:
- Modular pipelines.
- Stateless agents where possible.
- Clear separation of transformation and orchestration logic.
