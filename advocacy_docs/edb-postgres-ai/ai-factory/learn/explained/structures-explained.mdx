**Structures** in **Gen AI Builder** are Griptape-powered agents, pipelines, and workflows that enable advanced AI logic, data processing, and system integration.

Structures are foundational to building **production-ready, intelligent applications** with **EDB Postgres® AI** (EDB PG AI):

- Execute complex **AI workflows**
- Transform and enrich data
- Implement custom **Tools** and **Retrievers**
- Integrate with external APIs and business systems

**Without Structures**, Assistants and RAG pipelines are limited to static retrieval and generation — Structures provide the **custom logic** that brings intelligence and business context to your AI Factory applications.

## Before you start

Prerequisites for understanding Structures:

- Familiarity with **Assistants** and **Knowledge Bases**
- Awareness of **Retrievers**, **Rulesets**, and **Tools**
- Basic understanding of **Griptape Structures** and **RAG pipelines**

## What is a Structure?

A **Structure** is a reusable component that encapsulates advanced AI behavior:

* AI agents and pipelines
* Data transformations
* API integrations
* Workflow orchestration
* Custom retrieval logic

Structures can be:

- Run on demand from the AI Factory Web Console
- Invoked programmatically via API
- Published as **Tools** for Assistants
- Integrated into **Data Source pipelines** and **Knowledge Base pipelines**

**In short:**
**Structures bring custom intelligence and business process integration to your AI Factory applications.**

---

## Why use Structures?

- Define **organization-specific business logic**
- Support **multi-step reasoning** and **workflow orchestration**
- Extend Assistants with **custom Tools**
- Enrich and transform incoming data
- Implement **custom retrieval** pipelines
- Integrate AI with **external systems** (APIs, databases, SaaS platforms)

**Structures make your AI applications extensible, compliant, and deeply integrated with enterprise systems.**

---

## How Structures work

Structures are implemented as:

- **Griptape Agents** → conversational AI logic
- **Griptape Pipelines** → multi-step data transformation
- **Griptape Workflows** → complex orchestration across agents and tools

A Structure includes:

- **Structure config** → YAML or Python definition
- **Structure code** → Python, packaged as Zip or GitHub repo
- **Environment variables** → for API keys, secrets, and parameters

Execution paths:

```Web Console → Structure Execution
API Call → Structure Execution
Assistant → Tool → Structure Execution
Data Source Pipeline → Structure Execution
```

---

## Where Structures fit in AI Factory pipelines

```Data Sources → Data Lake → Libraries → Knowledge Bases → Retrievers → Assistants
```

Structures can:

- Implement **custom Data Sources**
- Perform **Data Source transformations**
- Provide **Tools** for Assistants
- Enrich RAG pipelines with **custom retrieval logic**

---

## When to use Structures

Use Structures when you need:

- Advanced AI capabilities beyond simple Q&A
- Complex **data transformations**
- Business **workflow orchestration**
- **API integrations** and external lookups
- **Dynamic Tools** for Assistants
- **Custom search** with advanced ranking or filtering

**Typical use cases:**

- Transaction categorization and tagging
- Data anonymization for privacy compliance
- Product catalog enrichment
- API-driven Tools for Assistants (inventory, pricing, logistics)
- Complex summarization agents
- Custom hybrid retrieval logic for RAG pipelines

---

## Patterns of use

### Standalone Structure

- Executed on demand via UI or API
- Example: `Data Anonymizer` run manually or on schedule

### Structure as a Tool

- Published as a **Tool** in AI Factory
- Invoked by Assistants at runtime
- Example: `Product Inventory Lookup` Tool used by Support Assistant

### Structure as Data Transformer

- Integrated into **Data Source pipeline**
- Transforms raw data before indexing
- Example: `PDF Parser + Metadata Enricher` pipeline

### Structure as Custom Retriever / Data Source

- Implements a **custom Retriever** or **custom Data Source**
- Example: `Real-Time Pricing Retriever` that queries external pricing APIs and merges results with Knowledge Base content

### Structure as Business Workflow Orchestrator

- Executes multi-step business logic
- Example: `Order Processing Workflow` → fetch inventory, calculate shipping, update CRM, notify customer

---

## Best practices

- Package Structures cleanly:
- Clear Structure Config
- Minimal, isolated external dependencies
- Externalize secrets via **environment variables**
- Implement **robust error handling** and retries
- Validate performance for production use cases
- Use **versioned Data Lake paths** where applicable
- Monitor execution performance and success rates
- Follow Griptape best practices:
- Modular pipelines and workflows
- Stateless agents where possible
- Clear separation of transformation and orchestration logic
- Use **audit trails** for critical business workflows
- Maintain **governance** for any externally integrated APIs or data

---

## Sovereign AI alignment

Structures are a key enabler of **Sovereign AI** with EDB PG AI:

* Run **inside your infrastructure**
* Fully auditable and version-controlled
* Behavior and API integrations are transparent and governed
* No reliance on third-party "black box" plugins or agents
* Integrated observability and monitoring via Hybrid Manager

**Structures enable you to build intelligent, integrated, compliant AI workflows — fully under your control.**

---

## Summary

Structures make your AI Factory extensible and production-grade:

* Implement custom business logic
* Integrate with enterprise APIs and systems
* Transform and enrich data pipelines
* Extend Assistants with powerful Tools
* Enable Sovereign AI with full auditability and control

Without Structures, your AI Factory applications cannot fully reflect your business workflows or compliance requirements.
