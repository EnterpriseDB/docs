description: Understand the role of Threads in Gen AI Builder and how they provide conversation history, state persistence, and insights into Assistant behavior.

## What is a Thread

A **Thread** in Gen AI Builder represents a **single conversation history** — a sequence of interactions (messages) between a user and an AI Assistant.

Threads allow you to:

- Review entire conversations.
- Debug and analyze Assistant behavior.
- Persist and manage conversation context.
- Support compliance and audit requirements.

Each Thread stores:

- The full message flow.
- Tool invocations and results.
- Memory state (if applicable).
- System-level metadata.

In short:
**Threads are the *source of truth* for understanding what happened in an AI-powered conversation.**

## Why use Threads

- To **review conversation history** and verify behavior.
- To **analyze user interaction patterns** and improve Assistants.
- To **debug issues** reported by users.
- To support **compliance auditing** with conversation logs.
- To track and manage **conversation memory**.
- To enable **stateful experiences** that span multiple sessions.

Threads are essential for **production AI systems** where quality, traceability, and state persistence are required.

## How Threads work

At runtime:

1. User initiates a conversation → new **Thread** is created.
2. Each user input and Assistant response is added to the Thread.
3. If **Tools** are invoked, their results are recorded in the Thread.
4. If **memory** is enabled, context state is updated in the Thread.
5. The Thread persists across turns → enabling coherent multi-turn conversations.

Data flow:

```User Input → Assistant → LLM → Response
→ Message added to Thread → Memory updated → Tool results recorded
→ Next user input → repeat
```

Every Thread captures:

- Message sequence (user → Assistant → user ...).
- Tool calls and responses.
- Memory state across turns.
- Timestamps and metadata.

## When to use Threads

Use Threads when you need to:

- Perform **QA** on Assistant behavior.
- Debug reported issues.
- Analyze conversation flows to improve Assistants.
- Verify that **Rulesets** and **Knowledge Bases** are applied correctly.
- Support **compliance** with auditable conversation records.
- Implement stateful Assistants with long-term memory.

## Patterns of use

### Conversation QA

- Regularly review Threads for key Assistants.
- Spot tone issues, factual errors, Rule violations.

### Debugging

- Investigate specific user reports:
- Find the Thread.
- Trace conversation step-by-step.

### Compliance auditing

- Export Threads for regulated Assistants.
- Provide conversation logs for external audits.

### Conversation analytics

- Analyze common user questions.
- Identify gaps in Knowledge Bases.
- Inform content strategy.

### Stateful Assistants

- Implement Assistants with memory.
- Use Threads to maintain and review conversation state.

## Best practices

- Regularly **review Threads** as part of QA processes.
- Implement **naming conventions** or metadata to make Threads easily searchable.
- Use **Thread search and filtering** to quickly locate relevant conversations.
- Monitor **Tool usage** inside Threads — validate Tool call success and outputs.
- For **memory-enabled Assistants**, use Threads to monitor:
- Context flow.
- Summary accuracy.
- Memory window settings.
- For **compliance-sensitive Assistants**, implement automated export or archiving of Threads.
- Retain Threads according to **data retention policies**:
- Privacy requirements.
- Audit needs.
- Storage cost considerations.
