# Threads Explained

**Threads** in **Gen AI Builder** represent **persistent conversation history** — a complete sequence of interactions between a user and an AI Assistant.

Threads enable **traceability**, **observability**, and **state management** for AI-powered applications built with **EDB Postgres® AI** (EDB PG AI).

Each Thread stores:

* Full message flow
* Tool invocations and results
* Memory state (if enabled)
* System-level metadata and timestamps

**Without Threads**, Assistants would be stateless and untraceable — Threads provide the foundation for **production-grade, auditable, stateful AI experiences**.

## Before you start

Prerequisites for understanding Threads:

- Familiarity with **Assistants** in Gen AI Builder
- Understanding of **Memory** and **multi-turn AI conversations**
- Awareness of **Tools** and **Rulesets** in AI Factory

## Why it matters

Threads are essential for:

* **Traceability** — Review and audit AI behavior
* **Debugging** — Analyze issues and user reports
* **Compliance** — Maintain auditable conversation records
* **Analytics** — Improve Assistant quality and Knowledge Base coverage
* **Stateful experiences** — Enable multi-turn memory for personalized interactions

Without Threads, AI applications built with EDB PG AI would lack critical observability and governance features — **incompatible with enterprise AI and Sovereign AI requirements**.

## What is a Thread?

A **Thread** represents a persistent, versioned record of a conversation between a user and an AI Assistant.

Each Thread includes:

- Full sequence of messages (user → Assistant → user → ...).
- **Tool** invocations and responses.
- **Memory state** across turns (if enabled).
- System metadata:
- Timestamps
- Assistant configuration
- Knowledge Bases and Retriever used
- Rulesets applied
- Model serving runtime and version

**In short:**
**Threads are the single source of truth for understanding what happened in an AI conversation.**

---

## How Threads work

At runtime:

1. User initiates conversation → new **Thread** is created.
2. Each user input and Assistant response is recorded in the Thread.
3. **Tool** calls and responses are logged.
4. **Memory state** is updated and stored (if enabled).
5. Thread persists across turns → enabling coherent multi-turn conversations.
6. Thread can be:
- Reviewed via UI or API
- Exported for compliance or analysis
- Monitored as part of QA processes

**Data flow:**

```User Input → Assistant → LLM → Response
→ Message added to Thread → Memory updated → Tool results recorded
→ Next user input → repeat
```

## When to use Threads

Use Threads when you need:

* **Production AI deployments** — Trace and govern every interaction
* **Debugging workflows** — Investigate specific user reports
* **Compliance auditing** — Maintain long-term, auditable conversation history
* **Analytics and QA** — Analyze common questions, identify gaps, tune Assistants
* **Stateful experiences** — Implement Assistants with personalized memory

**Threads are required for any enterprise-grade AI Factory deployment — they are not optional for production use cases.**

## Patterns of use

### Conversation QA

- Regular review of Threads to:
- Identify tone/style issues
- Spot hallucination risks
- Validate Rule and Knowledge Base adherence

### Debugging

- Investigate specific user reports:
- Locate Thread
- Trace step-by-step what happened
- Verify memory and Tool behavior

### Compliance auditing

- Export Threads for:
- Regulated Assistants (finance, healthcare, legal)
- Internal compliance programs
- Third-party audits

### Conversation analytics

- Analyze Threads to:
- Understand user interaction patterns
- Identify content gaps in Knowledge Bases
- Tune Rulesets and Retriever settings
- Guide Assistant design improvements

### Stateful Assistants with Memory

- Enable Assistants to maintain context across turns and sessions:
- Personalization (name, preferences)
- Conversation continuity
- Contextual summarization for long-term memory

---

## Best practices

- Establish **Thread review processes** for production Assistants.
- Implement **Thread naming conventions** or metadata for easier search and filtering.
- Use **Thread filtering and search** tools to locate conversations by:
- Assistant
- User ID (where applicable)
- Date/time
- Rule / Knowledge Base / Retriever
- Monitor **Tool usage** inside Threads — validate that Tools perform reliably.
- For **memory-enabled Assistants**:
- Monitor summarization quality and memory window behavior.
- Regularly review multi-turn memory flow.
- Define and enforce **Thread retention policies**:
- Comply with privacy and data protection requirements.
- Meet audit and compliance needs.
- Balance storage costs with retention value.

## Sovereign AI alignment

Threads are a critical component of **Sovereign AI** with EDB PG AI:

* Stored and governed in **your infrastructure**
* Fully auditable and exportable
* Support for enterprise **compliance** requirements
* Enable robust **QA** and continuous improvement of Assistants
* Integrated with Hybrid Manager observability

**Without Threads, Sovereign AI is not possible — they provide the essential observability layer for AI-powered experiences.**

---

## Summary

Threads make AI Factory **production-capable**:

* Persistent, versioned conversation history
* Auditable for compliance
* Critical for debugging and QA
* Enable personalized, memory-driven experiences
* Aligned with Sovereign AI principles

**Threads are not just a log — they are the operational backbone of enterprise AI in EDB PG AI.**
