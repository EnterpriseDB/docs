description: Understand what Knowledge Bases are, their role in Gen AI Builder, and how they power AI applications in EDB PG AI.
---


**Knowledge Bases** are the **semantic core** of AI Factory — transforming your organizational content into a structured, queryable, AI-friendly layer.

They enable AI applications to **retrieve trusted, relevant information** at query time:

- Power **semantic search** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**
- Ground AI Agents and Assistants in **your organization’s knowledge**
- Support **hybrid structured + unstructured queries** for advanced AI workflows

Without Knowledge Bases, Gen AI Builder agents and Assistants would lack the ability to retrieve trusted, explainable knowledge.

## Before you start

Prerequisites for understanding Knowledge Bases:

- Basic understanding of **Embeddings** and **Vector Search**
- Familiarity with AI Factory **Data Sources** and **Libraries**
- Awareness of **Retrievers**, **Assistants**, and **RAG**

Suggested path:

- [AI Factory Concepts](ai-factory-concepts)
- [AI Factory 101 Path](../paths/101)

## What is a Knowledge Base?

A **Knowledge Base** is an indexed store of content optimized for:

- **Semantic search** — find relevant content by meaning, not keywords
- **RAG** — enrich LLM outputs with trusted, up-to-date knowledge
- **Hybrid queries** — combine metadata filtering with semantic search
- **Explainability** — trace responses back to original content sources

It acts as an **optimized layer between your raw content and your AI Agents / Assistants**.

### Pipeline flow:

```
Data Sources → Libraries → Knowledge Bases → Retrievers → Assistants → AI Applications
```

Components:

- **Data Sources** — Raw content (documents, web pages, APIs)
- **Libraries** — Processed and structured content collections
- **Knowledge Bases** — Indexed, query-optimized semantic layer
- **AI Applications** — Agents, Assistants, APIs, user-facing apps

---

## Why use Knowledge Bases?

Knowledge Bases enable you to:

- **Ground AI models** in your organization's knowledge
- Provide **explainable AI** with traceable, source-linked results
- Support **RAG pipelines** for domain-specific and compliant LLM applications
- Perform **semantic search** across trusted content
- Support **hybrid filtering** (structured metadata + semantic vectors)
- Enable **multi-source knowledge orchestration** (combine multiple Libraries)

---

## How Knowledge Bases work

### 1. Creation

You create a Knowledge Base and select one or more Libraries as its source:

- Ingests content from Libraries
- Creates vector embeddings for unstructured content
- Indexes structured metadata columns for hybrid queries

### 2. Querying

Knowledge Bases support:

- **Vector search** — semantic similarity matching
- **Hybrid search** — combine vector + structured filters
- **RAG** — retrieved content injected into LLM prompts at runtime
- **Explainability** — results linked back to source documents

### 3. Refresh & maintenance

When source Libraries change:

- Knowledge Bases can be **re-synced** to reflect latest content
- You can manage versioning and refresh cycles for consistency and governance

---

## Types of Knowledge Bases

AI Factory supports multiple Knowledge Base deployment options:

- **Fully managed vector store**
Cloud-based, optimized for semantic search and scalability

- **Self-managed Postgres with vector search**
Leverage Postgres + pgvector extension for in-database semantic search

- **Hybrid Knowledge Base**
Combine structured metadata with unstructured embeddings for advanced hybrid search patterns

---

## Patterns of use

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

- Power AI Agents and Assistants with trusted knowledge
- Inject retrieved context into LLM prompts
- Improve accuracy and reduce hallucination

### Knowledge search portals

- Build semantic search experiences on top of Knowledge Bases
- Combine with metadata filtering for enterprise knowledge discovery

### Explainable AI workflows

- Ensure responses can be traced back to source content
- Support regulatory, compliance, and audit requirements

### Multi-Knowledge Base orchestration

- Use multiple Knowledge Bases with weighted relevance
- Support multiple domains or languages
- Enable personalized or role-specific knowledge pipelines

---

## Best practices

- Carefully **design Hybrid Knowledge Bases** to align structured + unstructured content
- Organize **Libraries** thoughtfully — they define your Knowledge Base quality
- Maintain **clear governance** — version Libraries and Knowledge Bases
- Monitor **query performance** — tune retrievers and embeddings as needed
- Combine with **Rulesets** and **Memory** in Assistants to ensure coherent behavior

---

## Role in Hybrid and Sovereign AI

Knowledge Bases are central to AI Factory’s **Sovereign AI** vision:

- Content stays in **your infrastructure**
- AI applications use **your knowledge** and pipelines
- Knowledge Bases can run on:
- Fully managed vector store
- Self-managed Postgres
- Hybrid Manager (KServe + Postgres + object storage)
- Full **observability and control** through Hybrid Manager dashboards
- Knowledge governance and versioning are first-class features

## Lifecycle of a Knowledge Base

| Phase           | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| Creation        | Define Knowledge Base and connect Libraries |
| Population      | Index Library content and generate embeddings |
| Querying        | Support AI pipelines via Retriever interface |
| Refresh         | Re-sync Knowledge Base as Library content evolves |
| Maintenance     | Manage versioning, governance, and observability |
