## What is an Assistant

An **Assistant** in Gen AI Builder is an AI-powered agent designed to interact with users, perform tasks, access knowledge, and follow predefined behavioral guidelines.

Assistants unify:

- **Natural language interaction** via LLMs
- **Knowledge retrieval** via Knowledge Bases and Retrievers
- **Behavior control** via Rulesets
- **Task execution** via Tools
- **Conversation memory** to maintain context

In short:
**Assistants turn AI Factory components into interactive, useful applications.**

Assistants are the primary **deployment target** for most conversational and task-based AI use cases in Gen AI Builder.

## Why use Assistants

- To build **AI-driven user experiences** — chatbots, agents, copilots.
- To combine **retrieved knowledge** with **controlled behavior**.
- To enable **multi-step reasoning** and **task execution**.
- To enforce **compliance**, **brand tone**, and **organizational policies**.
- To provide **consistent memory and context** across conversations.

Without Assistants, your AI Factory content (Knowledge Bases, Rulesets, Tools) would remain static — Assistants activate these components.

## How Assistants work

At runtime:

1. The user submits input (text or other supported input).
2. The Assistant:
- Applies its assigned **Rulesets**.
- Retrieves relevant content from **Knowledge Bases** (via its Retriever).
- Applies **conversation memory**.
- Executes **Tools** if needed.
- Generates a response using its assigned **LLM**.

3. The response is returned to the user.

Assistant architecture:

```User Input → Rulesets → Retriever → Knowledge Bases → Retrieved Content
→ Tools → Action Execution
→ Memory → Context Maintenance
→ LLM → Response → User Output
```



## Core components of an Assistant

### LLM

- The Large Language Model that powers language understanding and generation.
- Example choices:
- GPT-4
- Claude 3 Sonnet
- Gemini Pro
- Custom models via KServe

### Knowledge Bases + Retriever

- Retrieve relevant content using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
- Retriever defines search behavior.
- Knowledge Bases provide indexed, trusted content.

### Rulesets

- Define **how** the Assistant should behave.
- Enforce tone, style, policy, and compliance.

### Tools

- Extend Assistant capabilities beyond language generation.
- Example Tools:
- API calls
- Calculators
- Internal system lookups
- External data retrieval

### Memory

- Controls **conversation context**:
- How many turns to remember
- How to summarize or truncate history
- Enables multi-turn coherent interactions.

## When to use Assistants

Use Assistants when you want to expose AI Factory capabilities through:

- **Conversational interfaces** (chatbots, support bots, advisors)
- **Internal productivity tools** (compliance checkers, knowledge agents)
- **Copilot-style assistants** (embedded in applications)
- **Custom API endpoints** driven by AI logic

Assistants are the **primary vehicle for production AI applications** in Gen AI Builder.

## Patterns of use

### Single Assistant per use case

- One Assistant → one primary interaction pattern.
- Example: `PG Financial Client Support AI`.

### Persona-based Assistants

- Different Assistants for different **personas** or roles.
- Example:
- `Wealth Management Advisor`
- `Marketing Copy Generator`
- `Internal Policy Checker`

### Shared Knowledge + Ruleset Assistants

- Multiple Assistants sharing Knowledge Bases and Rulesets.
- Useful for enforcing consistent behavior across applications.

### Memory-driven Assistants

- Assistants configured with advanced Memory settings.
- Useful for:
- Long-term user relationships.
- Complex multi-turn workflows.

## Best practices

- Always combine **Knowledge Bases** + **Rulesets** → for grounded, controlled behavior.
- Use Tools only where needed — avoid unnecessary Tool complexity.
- Start simple → iterate on:
- System prompt
- Rulesets
- Retriever tuning
- Memory configuration
- Test Assistants extensively before production.
- Monitor Assistant performance and refine over time.
