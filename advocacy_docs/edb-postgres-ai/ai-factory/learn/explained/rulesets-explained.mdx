## What is a Ruleset

A **Ruleset** in Gen AI Builder is a collection of natural language Rules that guide the behavior of Assistants and Structures.
Rulesets define *how* an AI should behave when generating responses — complementing the *what* that comes from Knowledge Bases and Retrievers.

Rulesets are written in natural language and provide clear instructions such as:

- Maintain a polite and professional tone.
- Do not mention competitors.
- Always include legal disclaimers when discussing financial advice.

In short:
**Rulesets shape the "voice" and compliance of your AI — ensuring consistent, brand-aligned, and policy-compliant behavior.**

## Why use Rulesets

- **Control tone and style:** Ensure Assistants match your organizational voice.
- **Enforce compliance:** Apply mandatory legal, ethical, or policy-driven behavior.
- **Support multiple personas:** Define distinct behavioral patterns for different Assistants.
- **Complement RAG:** Provide behavioral context that works alongside retrieved knowledge.

Without Rulesets, Assistants rely solely on base model behavior — which may not align with your organizational requirements.

## How Rulesets work

At runtime, the process is:

1. The user submits a query to the Assistant.
2. The Assistant forwards the query to its Retriever (if configured) and gathers relevant content.
3. The Assistant also applies its assigned **Ruleset**, which is passed to the underlying Griptape Structure that governs response generation.
4. The LLM receives:
- The user query
- Retrieved content (context)
- The **Ruleset** as behavioral instructions
5. The LLM generates a response **that adheres to the Ruleset** and is informed by the retrieved content.

Rulesets are implemented internally as **Griptape Structures**:

- Each Rule is a natural language instruction.
- The Ruleset defines which Rules apply to an Assistant.
- The Griptape runtime injects Ruleset instructions into the system prompt or preamble for the LLM.

See [Structures explained](structures) for more on Griptape Structures.

## When to use Rulesets

- **Always** when deploying Assistants in production.
- Whenever tone, style, or compliance matter.
- When building Assistants for different audiences:
- Support Agents
- Internal Knowledge Agents
- Sales and Marketing Assistants
- Executive Assistants
- When using different **personas** or Assistant "voices."

## Patterns of use

### Single Ruleset → One Assistant

- Simple pattern.
- One Ruleset defines the tone and policy for one Assistant.
- Example: `Polite Support Tone` Ruleset → assigned to `Customer Support Assistant`.

### Shared Ruleset → Multiple Assistants

- One Ruleset reused across multiple Assistants.
- Useful for enforcing organization-wide policies (e.g., legal disclaimers).
- Example: `Financial Advice Disclaimer` Ruleset → used by both `Wealth Management Bot` and `Internal Compliance Checker`.

### Layered persona Rulesets

- Use multiple Rulesets or composite Rulesets to create layered personas:
- Global compliance Ruleset
- Brand tone Ruleset
- Assistant-specific Ruleset
- Example:
- `Brand Tone` + `Legal Compliance` + `Executive Assistant Voice`

## Best practices

- Write Rules in **clear, unambiguous natural language**.
- Avoid conflicting or overlapping Rules.
- Test Assistants with Rulesets applied — adjust as needed.
- Use **Metadata** and **Alias** fields to support versioning and structured management.
- Keep global / reusable Rulesets modular (do not duplicate content across many Rulesets).
- Maintain an **audit trail** of Ruleset updates in regulated environments.
