# Learning Paths

AI Factory Learning Paths provide structured guidance to help you build **AI-powered features** and **intelligent applications** using AI Factory — with full control and governance.

Whether you're just starting or scaling **Sovereign AI** solutions in production, these paths guide you through key concepts, tools, and practical implementation — building on your experience as you progress.

## How to use the Learning Paths

Each path is **self-paced** and modular.

You can:

- Complete paths **sequentially** (101 → 201 → 301), or
- Dive into topics based on your **role** and **project needs**.

For each path:

- Review the **prerequisites** to ensure readiness.
- Follow the learning flow of:
- **Concepts → How-To Guides → Tutorials → Practice**
- Use your existing AI Factory environment or a sandbox project to practice hands-on.
