AI Factory Learning Paths provide structured guidance to help you build AI-powered features using AI Factory.

Whether you're just starting or scaling advanced AI workloads in production, these paths guide you through concepts, tools, and practical implementation — building on your experience as you progress.

---

## How to use the Learning Paths

Each path is designed to be self-paced. You can complete paths sequentially or dive into topics based on your role and project needs.

For each path, we recommend:
- Reviewing the **prerequisites** to ensure readiness.
- Following the learning flow of **Concepts → How-To Guides → Tutorials → Practice**.
- Using your existing AI Factory environment or a sandbox project to try the examples hands-on.
