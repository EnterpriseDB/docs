navTitle: Use Cases
description: Explore common technical use cases for building Sovereign AI applications and solutions with AI Factory.
---

AI Factory is designed to help you build **Sovereign AI** solutions — where your **data**, **models**, and **AI-driven applications** operate under your governance, in your infrastructure, with your trusted content.

These use cases highlight how AI Factory components work together to support **real-world, production-ready Sovereign AI applications** — across industries and solution patterns.

For industry-specific solution examples, see: [Industry Solutions](./solutions).

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**RAG** is a foundational pattern for Sovereign AI — it lets you deliver **accurate, grounded responses** by combining **LLMs** with your enterprise data.

### What

- Use AI models that **retrieve trusted content** from your Knowledge Bases, rather than relying only on opaque base models.
- Make responses **auditable** and **explainable** — key for Sovereign AI.

### Why

- Reduce hallucinations.
- Maintain compliance and traceability.
- Ensure AI answers reflect your latest business knowledge.

### How

- Build [Knowledge Bases](./how-to/gen-ai/create-knowledge-base) from your Data Sources.
- Implement tuned [Retrievers](./how-to/gen-ai/create-retriever) for semantic search.
- Power [Assistants](./how-to/gen-ai/create-assistant) and apps with RAG pipelines.

## Document Intelligence Pipelines

Automate the transformation of documents into **structured, queryable knowledge** that remains **inside your governance boundary**.

### What

- Apply **OCR**, **parsing**, **summarization**, and **metadata extraction**.
- Store results in [Knowledge Bases](./how-to/gen-ai/create-knowledge-base) or **Vector Engine**.

### Why

- Keep sensitive documents in your infrastructure — no third-party API calls required.
- Build explainable pipelines for compliance-heavy domains.

### How

- Use [Pipelines](../pipeline/gettingstarted).
- Leverage built-in [Preparers](../pipeline/preparers) (OCR, parse PDF, parse HTML).
- Index results for search or RAG.

## Conversational Assistants and Chatbots

Build Assistants that run **within your infrastructure**, use **your models**, and rely on **your Knowledge Bases** — with complete visibility and control.

### What

- AI Assistants powered by **Model Serving** and your **RAG pipeline**.
- Defined and governed with [Rulesets](./how-to/gen-ai/create-ruleset).

### Why

- Avoid relying on public API services for LLM responses.
- Control tone, style, compliance — essential for Sovereign AI.

### How

- Build [Assistants](./how-to/gen-ai/create-assistant) in [Agent Studio](../gen-ai/agent-studio/).
- Govern behavior with [Rulesets](./how-to/gen-ai/create-ruleset).
- Add [Tools](./how-to/gen-ai/create-tool) to safely integrate internal systems.

## Semantic Search Across Enterprise Content

Enable **natural language search** on your content — while ensuring embeddings and search data remain **inside your control**.

### What

- Vector-based search on **Knowledge Bases** or **Vector Engine**.
- Supports text, hybrid structured/unstructured data, images.

### Why

- Keep embeddings in your databases or object storage — not in third-party vector DBs.
- Maintain auditability and security.

### How

- Build [Knowledge Bases](./how-to/gen-ai/create-knowledge-base).
- Use [Retrievers](./how-to/gen-ai/create-retriever) to expose search to Assistants or apps.
- Use [Vector Engine](../vector-engine) for in-database search.

## Real-Time Model Inference APIs

Deploy and serve models **inside your Kubernetes clusters**, under your governance — not through opaque third-party APIs.

### What

- Serve LLMs, embeddings, vision models via **KServe-based Model Serving**.
- Models pulled from your [Model Library](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/model/library), deployed via [InferenceService](./how-to/model-serving/create-inferenceservice).

### Why

- Full control of model stack and model versions.
- Run inference in **GPU-accelerated, air-gapped environments** if needed.

### How

- Manage models in [Model Library](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/model/library).
- Deploy with [Model Serving](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/model/serving).
- Secure endpoints with Hybrid Manager controls.

## Automated AI-Powered ETL Pipelines

Keep **AI data pipelines** inside your controlled environment — with no data leakage.

### What

- Use [Structures](./how-to/gen-ai/create-structure) and Pipelines to run:
- AI categorization
- Document summarization
- Metadata extraction
- Data cleansing

### Why

- Avoid sending sensitive data to cloud APIs.
- Build reusable, explainable ETL components.

### How

- Build [Structures](./how-to/gen-ai/create-structure).
- Run as Tools in [Assistants](./how-to/gen-ai/create-assistant) or standalone Pipelines.
- Monitor and govern pipeline execution via Hybrid Manager.
