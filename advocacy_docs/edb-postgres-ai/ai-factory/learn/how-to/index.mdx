**EDB Postgres® AI** (EDB PG AI) enables you to build intelligent applications **on your data, in your Postgres estate, and under your governance**.

This section provides practical, step-by-step **How-to Guides** for building AI solutions with EDB PG AI, optimized for Hybrid Manager™ and Postgres workloads.

## Next Steps

You can combine these patterns to build production AI solutions:

- Assistants + Pipelines + Vector Search
- Model Serving + Pipelines + Gen AI
- Postgres + Vector Engine + Gen AI
- Hybrid Manager-deployed Pipelines and Serving

Explore [Use Cases](../use-cases.mdx) and [Solutions](../solutions.mdx) to see how these capabilities are applied in real-world scenarios.
