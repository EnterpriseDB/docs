## Who is this for

Platform users building advanced AI-powered applications in **Gen AI Builder** in **Hybrid Manager AI Factory**.
Typical users include developers, AI architects, and system integrators.

## What you will accomplish

You will create a **Tool** in Gen AI Builder by deploying a packaged component that enables Assistants and Structures to perform specific actions.

## Why create a Tool

- Tools allow Assistants and Structures to:
- Query external APIs.
- Perform calculations.
- Fetch live data.
- Interact with databases and internal services.
- Execute business logic.
- Tools extend AI Factory capabilities beyond text generation — enabling **true AI agents**.

For background, see:

- [Tools explained](edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/explained/tools-explained)
- [AI Factory Concepts](edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/explained/ai-factory-concepts)
- [Hybrid Manager: Using Gen AI Builder](edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder)

## Complexity and time to complete

- **Complexity**: Moderate
- **Estimated time**: 10–20 minutes

## When to create a Tool

- When you want Assistants to **fetch live data**.
- When AI agents need to **query APIs** or **run business logic**.
- When building reusable components for **multiple Assistants or Structures**.
- When implementing **process automation** or **integration patterns**.

## Pre-requisites

- Tool packaged as a **Zip file**:
- Includes Tool code and dependencies.
- Contains Tool configuration (typically YAML or Python).
- Uploaded to your configured **Data Lake**.

## How to create a Tool

### 1. Navigate to Tools

- In Gen AI Builder UI, go to **Tools**.

### 2. Create a new Tool

- Click **Create Tool**.

### 3. Select creation method

- Choose **Griptape Tool from Data Lake**.

### 4. Configure Tool fields

#### Name (required)

- Provide a clear, unique name.
- Example: `PG_Financial_Stock_Ticker`

#### Description (optional)

- Describe what the Tool does.
- Example: `Fetches live stock ticker prices from external API.`

### 5. Configure Data Lake parameters

#### Bucket Id (required)

- Select the **Data Lake bucket** where your Tool Zip file is stored.

#### Asset Path (required)

- Provide the full path to your Zip file inside the selected bucket.
- Example: `tools/stock_ticker_tool.zip`

### 6. Configure Tool Config parameters

#### Tool Config File (recommended)

- Enter the relative path inside the Zip to your Tool Config file.
- Example: `tool_config.yaml`

### 7. Configure environment variables (optional)

You can define environment variables that will be available to the Tool.

#### Add individual variables

- **Type:** Variable or Secret.
- **Name:** Example: `STOCK_API_KEY`
- **Value:** Example: `your_actual_api_key_here`

#### Import .env file

- Optionally paste contents of a `.env` file to bulk import variables.

### 8. Finalize creation

- Click **Create**.

The system will:

- Unzip your file.
- Set up the runtime environment.
- Make the Tool available in AI Factory.

### 9. Verify deployment

- Your Tool will appear in the **Tools** list.
- Monitor **deployment status**.
- You can now:
- Assign the Tool to Assistants.
- Use the Tool in a Structure.
- Test the Tool (if direct test is supported).

## Example scenario: Deploy a PG Financial FX Rate Tool

1. Package Griptape Tool `FxRateTool`.
2. Upload to Data Lake:
  - Bucket: `pgai-tools`
  - Path: `fx_rate_tool/fx_rate_tool.zip`
3. Create Tool:
  - Name: `PG_Financial_FX_Rate_Tool`
  - Description: `Fetches live FX rates from external API.`
  - Bucket Id: `pgai-tools`
  - Asset Path: `fx_rate_tool/fx_rate_tool.zip`
  - Tool Config File: `tool_config.yaml`
4. Add env variables:
  - Name: `FX_API_KEY`
  - Value: `your_key_here`
5. Click **Create**.

Next steps:

- Test the Tool.
- Assign the Tool to Assistants as needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Tool deploy fails

- Verify Zip file contents:
- Tool code is valid.
- Tool Config file is present and correctly referenced.
- Confirm the **Data Lake path** is correct and accessible.

### Environment variables not working

- Confirm variables are entered correctly.
- If using Secrets, ensure Secrets are properly configured.

### Tool not appearing for Assistant selection

- Verify the Tool implements proper interface and is published.
- Confirm the Tool status is active.

### Tool errors at runtime

- Review Tool logs in Gen AI Builder UI.
- Verify external API endpoints and credentials.
- Check Tool Config settings.

## Best practices

- Implement Tools as modular, single-responsibility components.
- Externalize API keys and credentials via environment variables.
- Implement **robust error handling**.
- Test Tools in isolation before assigning to Assistants.
- Monitor Tool usage and performance.
- Version your Tool artifacts in Data Lake.
