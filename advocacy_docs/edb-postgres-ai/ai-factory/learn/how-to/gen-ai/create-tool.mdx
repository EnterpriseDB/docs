description: How to create a Tool in Gen AI Builder by deploying a Griptape-powered Tool from a Zip file.
---

## Who is this for

Platform users building advanced AI-powered applications in Gen AI Builder using Griptape Tools.
Typical users include developers, AI architects, and system integrators.

## What you will accomplish

You will create a **Tool** in Gen AI Builder by deploying a Griptape-powered component that enables Assistants or Structures to perform specific actions.

## Why create a Tool

- Tools enable Assistants and Structures to:
- Query external APIs.
- Perform calculations.
- Fetch live data.
- Interact with databases and internal services.
- Tools extend AI Factory capabilities beyond simple text generation.

For background, see:

- [AI Factory Concepts](../../../learn/explained/ai-factory-concepts)
- [Hybrid Manager: Using Gen AI Builder](../../../../hybrid-manager/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder/index)

## Complexity and time to complete

- **Complexity**: Moderate
- **Estimated time**: 10â€“20 minutes

## Pre-requisites

- Griptape Tool packaged as a Zip file:
- Includes Tool code + dependencies.
- Includes Tool configuration (typically YAML or Python).
- Tool Zip file uploaded to Data Lake.

## How to create a Tool

### 1. Navigate to Tools

- Go to **Tools** in the Gen AI Builder UI.
This may appear under **TOOLS**, **APPS**, or a dedicated category.

### 2. Create a new Tool

- Click **Create Tool**.

### 3. Select creation method

- Use **Griptape Tool from Data Lake**.
- Click **Select**.

### 4. Configure Tool fields

#### Name (required)

- Label: **Name of your Tool**
- Action: Enter a unique and descriptive name.
Example: `PG_Financial_Stock_Ticker`

#### Description (optional)

- Label: **Description of your Tool**
- Action: Describe what the Tool does.
Example: `Fetches live stock ticker prices from external API.`

### 5. Configure Data Lake parameters

#### Bucket Id (required)

- Label: **Select a PG.AI Bucket**
- Action: Select the Data Lake bucket where your Tool Zip is stored.

#### Asset Path (required)

- Label: **your-folder/tool-code.zip**
- Action: Enter the full path to your Zip file inside the bucket.
Example: `tools/stock_ticker_tool.zip`

### 6. Configure Tool Config parameters

#### Tool Config File (recommended)

- Label: **Path to the tool configuration file in your zip file**
- Action: Enter relative path inside the Zip to the Tool Config file.
Example: `tool_config.yaml`

### 7. Configure environment variables (optional)

#### Add individual variables

- Instruction: Set environment variables that will be passed to the Tool.

For each variable:

- **Type:** Variable (or Secret if supported).
- **Name:** e.g. `STOCK_API_KEY`
- **Value:** e.g. `your_actual_api_key_here`

#### Import .env file

- Optionally paste `.env` file contents to bulk import variables.

### 8. Finalize creation

- Click **Create** to deploy the Tool.

Deployment steps:

- System unzips the file.
- Sets up runtime environment.
- Makes the Tool available for execution.

### 9. Verify deployment

- The new Tool will appear in the Tools list.
- Monitor deployment **Status**.
- You can:
- Assign the Tool to Assistants.
- Use the Tool in a Structure.
- Test the Tool if a direct interface is provided.

## Example: Deploy a PG Financial FX Rate Tool

1. Package Griptape Tool `FxRateTool`.
2. Upload to Data Lake:
- Bucket: `pgai-tools`
- Path: `fx_rate_tool/fx_rate_tool.zip`
3. Create Tool:
- Name: `PG_Financial_FX_Rate_Tool`
- Description: `Fetches live FX rates from external API.`
- Bucket Id: `pgai-tools`
- Asset Path: `fx_rate_tool/fx_rate_tool.zip`
- Tool Config File: `tool_config.yaml`
4. Add env variables:
- Name: `FX_API_KEY`
- Value: `your_key_here`
5. Click **Create**.

Next steps:

- Test Tool functionality.
- Assign Tool to Assistants where needed.

## Troubleshooting

### Tool deploy fails

- Verify Zip file contents:
- Tool code is correct.
- Tool Config file is present and correctly referenced.
- Check Data Lake path is correct and accessible.

### Environment variables not working

- Confirm variables are added correctly.
- If using Secret type, verify secrets are configured properly.

### Tool not appearing for Assistant selection

- Ensure Tool implements proper Griptape Tool class and is published.
- Verify Tool status is active.
