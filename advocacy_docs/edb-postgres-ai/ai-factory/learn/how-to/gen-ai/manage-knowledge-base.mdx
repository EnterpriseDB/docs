## Who is this for

Platform users managing Knowledge Bases for AI applications in Gen AI Builder.
Typical users include developers, AI architects, data engineers, and content managers.

## What you will accomplish

You will learn how to manage existing Knowledge Bases in Gen AI Builder.
You will perform common management tasks:

-   Viewing existing Knowledge Bases
-   Editing Knowledge Base settings
-   Refreshing or re-syncing Knowledge Bases
-   Deleting Knowledge Bases
-   Viewing Knowledge Base details

## Why manage Knowledge Bases

-   Keeping your Knowledge Bases up to date ensures AI applications deliver current and accurate responses.
-   Managing your Knowledge Bases helps control storage and cost by cleaning up unused or obsolete Knowledge Bases.
-   Monitoring Knowledge Base status and content improves reliability and performance in production AI workflows.

For background, see:

-   [AI Factory Concepts](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/explained/ai-factory-concepts)
-   [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/explained/terminology/#retrieval-augmented-generation-rag)

## Complexity and time to complete

-   **Complexity**: Low.
-   **Estimated time**: 2–5 minutes per Knowledge Base.

## Viewing existing Knowledge Bases

1.  Navigate to **Knowledge Bases** in the Gen AI Builder console.
2.  The Knowledge Bases list view displays:

-   **Name**: User-defined name (example: `docs-temp-hcp`).
-   **Created**: Creation date and time.
-   **Updated**: Last updated date and time.
-   **Status**: Operational status (example: `Succeeded`).
-   **Type**: Backend type (example: `GenAI Builder Vector` or `vector`).

3.  Use pagination controls to navigate large lists (example: `Rows per page: 5 1-5 of 8 < >`).

## Viewing Knowledge Base details

1.  Click on a Knowledge Base name or **View Details** icon to open its detail page.
2.  The detail view typically shows:

-   **Name** and **Description**
-   **Created** and **Updated** timestamps
-   **Status** and backend **Type**
-   **Linked Libraries** or **Data Sources**
-   **Indexing or sync status**
-   Recent activity or job history

## Editing a Knowledge Base

> **Note:** Edit capabilities may be limited after Knowledge Base creation, depending on type.

1.  In the Knowledge Bases list view, select the **Edit** action (typically from an actions menu or edit icon).
2.  You may be able to edit:

-   **Description**
-   In some cases, the set of Libraries or Data Sources (depends on type)
-   Configuration for Hybrid KB structured/unstructured columns (if supported)

3.  Save changes.

## Refreshing or re-syncing a Knowledge Base

1.  In the Knowledge Bases list view, select the **Refresh** or **Re-sync** action.
2.  The system will:

-   Pull the latest data from linked Libraries.
-   Re-index the Knowledge Base if necessary.

> Use this action when source Libraries have been updated and you want to propagate changes to the Knowledge Base.

## Deleting a Knowledge Base

> **Warning:** Deleting a Knowledge Base is irreversible. This will remove the Knowledge Base and its content from AI applications.

1.  In the Knowledge Bases list view, select the **Delete** action (typically from an actions menu or delete icon).
2.  Confirm the deletion when prompted.

> This will not delete the source Libraries — only the Knowledge Base.

## Troubleshooting

### Knowledge Base status shows "Error" or "Failed"

-   Click **View Details** and check the activity log or job history.
-   If the Knowledge Base is linked to an external database (Self-Managed PG.AI Database), verify that the database connection is healthy.

### Refresh operation does not update expected content

-   Verify that the linked Libraries have been refreshed and contain the latest data.
-   Re-run the Refresh / Re-sync action.
-   Check that Libraries are correctly configured with expected Data Sources and Transformations.

### Cannot edit certain fields

-   Some Knowledge Base types (especially Fully-Managed Vector Stores and Self-Managed DBs) restrict editing of certain configuration fields after creation.
-   To change these fields, you may need to create a new Knowledge Base.

## Example scenario

You want to refresh and check the status of a Knowledge Base used in production:

1.  Navigate to **Knowledge Bases**.
2.  Locate `Company Policy KB`.
3.  Click **View Details** → confirm recent Libraries were updated.
4.  Click **Refresh** → re-sync the Knowledge Base.
5.  Monitor status until **Succeeded**.
