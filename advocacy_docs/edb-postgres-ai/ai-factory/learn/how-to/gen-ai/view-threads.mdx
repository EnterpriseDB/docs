description: How to view and manage Threads in Gen AI Builder to analyze conversation history and Assistant behavior.
---

## Who is this for

Platform users who need to review and analyze **conversation history** for QA, compliance, debugging, or Assistant improvement.
Typical users include developers, QA teams, AI architects, and compliance officers.

## What you will accomplish

You will:

- Navigate to the **Threads** section.
- View existing Threads.
- Open individual Threads.
- Inspect message flow and Assistant behavior.
- Understand how to analyze and manage Threads.

## Why view Threads

- Threads provide the **complete conversation history** between users and Assistants.
- They allow you to:
- Verify Assistant behavior and tone.
- Audit conversations for compliance.
- Debug unexpected issues.
- Analyze user interaction patterns.
- Review Tool usage and memory state.

- [AI Factory Concepts](../../../learn/explained/ai-factory-concepts)
- [Hybrid Manager: Using Gen AI Builder](../../../../hybrid-manager/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder/index)

## Complexity and time to complete

- **Complexity**: Low
- **Estimated time**: 5–10 minutes

## Pre-requisites

- At least one existing Thread generated by an Assistant conversation.

## How to view Threads

### 1. Navigate to Threads

- Go to **Threads** in the Gen AI Builder UI.
This may appear under **TOOLS**, **APPS**, or a dedicated category.

### 2. View Threads list

You will see a list of existing Threads.
Each Thread displays:

- **Name:** User-defined or auto-generated.
- **Alias:** Unique Thread ID.
- **Created:** When Thread started.
- **Updated:** Last message timestamp.

Other UI elements:

- **Search bar:** Find Threads by name or alias.
- **Create Thread:** (Optional) Start new Thread if supported.
- **Pagination controls:** Navigate large lists.

### 3. Search for relevant Thread

- Use **Search** to locate a specific Thread.
- Common searches:
- User ID
- Assistant name
- Keywords from initial message
- Thread alias

### 4. Open a Thread

- Click on a Thread **Name** or **Alias** to open it.

### 5. Inspect Thread details

#### Thread header

- **Thread Name / Alias**
- **ID:** Copyable unique identifier.
- **Created / Updated** timestamps.

#### Actions menu

- Options may include:
- Edit Thread properties.
- Delete Thread.
- Export Thread.

#### Message list (left pane)

- Sequence of messages:
- Message ID
- Created / Updated timestamps
- Message index (order in Thread)

#### Message details (right pane)

- Select a message to view:
- Full content (user message or Assistant response)
- Message metadata
- Tool invocations (if any)
- Memory state impact (if applicable)

### 6. Analyze conversation flow

- Step through messages to verify:
- **Intent understanding** → Did the Assistant correctly understand the user?
- **Knowledge accuracy** → Was information correct and well-sourced?
- **Tone and compliance** → Did the Assistant follow Rulesets?
- **Tool usage** → Were Tools invoked correctly and results incorporated?
- **Memory handling** → If using memory, was conversation state maintained appropriately?

### 7. Take action

- Use **Actions** menu as needed:
- Edit or rename Thread.
- Delete unwanted or test Threads.
- Export Thread for QA or audit.

## Example: Review a PG Financial Support Thread

Scenario:

- User asked about opening a new savings account with **PG Financial Support Assistant**.

Steps:

1. Navigate to **Threads**.
2. Search: `savings account` or `PG Financial Support Assistant`.
3. Open Thread: `"Inquiry about new savings account"`.
4. Review messages:
- Confirm initial intent: User asked about savings account.
- Check Assistant responses:
- Provided correct product details.
- Maintained polite tone per Rulesets.
- Retrieved accurate content from Knowledge Base.
5. Verify memory handling:
- User asked follow-up questions → Assistant responded appropriately.
6. Document any findings:
- Gaps in Knowledge Base.
- Rule violations.
- Improvement opportunities.

## Troubleshooting

### Thread not found

- Check that conversation was completed (may take a moment to appear in list).
- Verify search terms.
- Confirm you have appropriate project / Assistant scope.

### Messages missing

- Verify that Thread was not truncated or deleted.
- Confirm Tool outputs were logged if expected.

### Assistant behavior incorrect

- Use Thread analysis to:
- Identify Ruleset gaps.
- Refine Retriever configuration.
- Improve Knowledge Base coverage.
- Debug Tool behavior.
