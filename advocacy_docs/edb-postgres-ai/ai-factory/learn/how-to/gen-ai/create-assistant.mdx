## Who is this for

Platform users building AI-driven Assistants in **Gen AI Builder** in **Hybrid Manager AI Factory**.
Typical users include developers, AI architects, conversational designers, and content owners.

## What you will accomplish

You will create an **Assistant** — an AI-powered agent that can:

-   Interact with users through natural language
-   Retrieve knowledge from Knowledge Bases
-   Follow behavioral guidelines using Rulesets
-   Optionally perform actions via Tools

You will configure the core components of an Assistant and prepare it for use in production or testing.

## Why create an Assistant

Assistants provide the **interactive layer** for your AI Factory content and capabilities — enabling trusted, conversational access to your organization’s knowledge and services.

They unify:

-   Large Language Models (LLMs)
-   Knowledge Bases
-   Rulesets
-   Tools
-   Memory (for context-aware interactions)

Assistants allow end users to interact with your AI in a **guided, governed, and useful way** — powering applications such as internal copilots, support agents, and knowledge assistants.
