description: How to create a Ruleset in Gen AI Builder and define Rules to guide Assistant behavior.
---

## Who is this for

Platform users building Assistants or Structures in Gen AI Builder who want to define and enforce consistent behavior and style.
Typical users include developers, AI architects, content designers, and compliance owners.

## What you will accomplish

You will create a **Ruleset** — a collection of Rules written in natural language that guide your Assistant’s behavior.
You will add one or more Rules and associate the Ruleset with an Assistant.

## Why create a Ruleset

- To define **behavioral guidelines** for Assistants and Structures.
- To enforce tone, style, and policy compliance.
- To support multiple personas with different behavioral patterns.
- To complement Knowledge Bases and Retrievers in the AI pipeline.

## Complexity and time to complete

- **Complexity**: Low
- **Estimated time**: 5–10 minutes

## Pre-requisites

- Gen AI Builder deployed with Assistant features enabled.

## How to create a Ruleset

### 1. Navigate to Rulesets

- Go to **Rulesets** in the Gen AI Builder UI.
This may appear under **TOOLS** or a similar category.

### 2. Create a new Ruleset

- Click **Create Ruleset**.

### 3. Configure Ruleset fields

#### Name (required)

- Label: **Your Ruleset Name**
- Action: Enter a clear, unique name.
Example: `Customer Service Tone Rules`

#### Description (optional)

- Label: **Describe your Ruleset**
- Action: Provide context about the Ruleset’s purpose or scope.
Example: `Guidelines for polite, professional responses in customer interactions.`

#### Rules (required)

- Label: **Select the Rules that will be used to populate this Ruleset.**
- Action: Select one or more existing Rules, or create new Rules directly in this dialog.

##### Creating a new Rule (if needed)

- In the Rules field, click **(Create new rule)**.

In the **Create New Rule** modal:

- **Name** (required):
Example: `Maintain Polite Tone`

- **Rule text** (required):
Example: `Always address the user respectfully. Use polite greetings and sign-offs.`

- Click **Create** to save the Rule.

You can repeat this process to add multiple Rules to the Ruleset.

#### Alias (optional)

- Label: **Your Ruleset Alias**
- Action: Provide an optional, user-friendly alias.
Example: `polite-support`

#### Metadata (optional)

- Label: **Metadata should be a valid JSON object.**
- Action: Provide optional metadata in JSON format.
Example: `{ "version": "1.0", "author": "support_team" }`

### 4. Finalize Ruleset creation

- Click **Create** to save the Ruleset.
- The new Ruleset will appear in the list of Rulesets.

## Example: Create a "Polite Support Agent" Ruleset

1. Navigate to **Rulesets**.
2. Click **Create Ruleset**.
3. Fill out Ruleset fields:
- Name: `Polite Support Tone`
- Description: `Ensures the assistant maintains a polite and professional tone during customer interactions.`
- Alias: `polite-support`
- Metadata: `{ "version": "1.0", "author": "support_team" }`
4. Add Rules:
- Click **(Create new rule)**.
- Rule 1:
- Name: `Use Formal Salutations`
- Rule: `Always begin responses with a polite greeting, such as "Hello," or "Good day,". Address the user respectfully if their name is known.`
- Click **(Create new rule)**.
- Rule 2:
- Name: `Offer Assistance Clearly`
- Rule: `Clearly state how you can assist the user. For example, "How may I help you today?" or "I can assist you with..."`

5. Click **Create** to finalize the Ruleset.

6. Next steps:
- Associate this Ruleset with an Assistant in its configuration.

## Troubleshooting

### Ruleset not visible when configuring an Assistant

- Ensure that the Ruleset has at least one Rule.
- Verify that the Ruleset was created successfully.

### Conflicting or ambiguous Rules

- Review Rule text carefully — avoid ambiguous phrasing.
- Test Assistants with the Ruleset applied and adjust Rules as needed.

### Ruleset updates not reflected

- If you update a Rule or Ruleset, verify that the Assistant has the latest version assigned.
- Some Assistants may require a re-sync or refresh to pick up updated Rules.
