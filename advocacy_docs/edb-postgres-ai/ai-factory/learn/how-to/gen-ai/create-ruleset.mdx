## Who is this for

Platform users building **Assistants** or **Structures** in **Gen AI Builder** in **Hybrid Manager AI Factory**.
Typical users include developers, AI architects, content designers, and compliance owners.

## What you will accomplish

You will create a **Ruleset** — a collection of **Rules** written in natural language to guide the behavior, tone, and compliance of your Assistants or Structures.

You will:

-   Define one or more Rules.
-   Package them into a Ruleset.
-   Make the Ruleset available for use in Assistants.

## Why create a Ruleset

-   Rulesets define **behavioral guidelines** and **governance** for AI-driven interactions.
-   They control tone, style, and compliance in responses.
-   They help implement different **Assistant personas**.
-   They enable consistent behavior across Assistants and applications.
-   They complement Knowledge Bases and Retrievers in the AI pipeline.

- [Hybrid Manager: Using Gen AI Builder](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder)

## Complexity and time to complete

-   **Complexity**: Low
-   **Estimated time**: 5–10 minutes

## When to create a Ruleset

-   When defining the **tone**, **voice**, or **policy constraints** for an Assistant.
-   When implementing Assistants for different personas or user audiences.
-   When ensuring compliance with **brand standards** or **regulatory guidelines**.
-   Before assigning an Assistant to a production environment.

## Pre-requisites

-   Gen AI Builder deployed with **Assistant features** enabled.

## How to create a Ruleset

### 1. Navigate to Rulesets

-   In Gen AI Builder UI, go to **Rulesets**.

### 2. Create a new Ruleset

-   Click **Create Ruleset**.

### 3. Configure Ruleset fields

#### Name (required)

-   Provide a clear, unique name.
-   Example: `Customer Service Tone Rules`

#### Description (optional)

-   Describe the Ruleset’s purpose or scope.
-   Example: `Guidelines for polite, professional responses in customer interactions.`

#### Rules (required)

-   Select one or more existing **Rules** to populate the Ruleset.
-   If needed, create new Rules during this step.

##### Creating a new Rule

-   In the **Rules** field, click **Create new rule**.
-   In the modal:
-   **Name**: `Maintain Polite Tone`
-   **Rule text**: `Always address the user respectfully. Use polite greetings and sign-offs.`
-   Click **Create** to save the Rule.
-   Repeat to add additional Rules.

#### Alias (optional)

-   Provide an optional **alias** — a user-friendly reference name.
-   Example: `polite-support`

#### Metadata (optional)

-   Provide optional metadata as a valid JSON object.
-   Example: `{ "version": "1.0", "author": "support_team" }`

### 4. Finalize Ruleset creation

-   Click **Create** to save the Ruleset.
-   The new Ruleset will appear in the **Rulesets** list.
-   It is now available to assign to Assistants.

## Associating a Ruleset with an Assistant

-   When configuring an **Assistant**, go to **Behavior and Rules** or **Advanced Options**.
-   Select one or more **Rulesets** to assign.
-   The Ruleset will be used as **behavioral guidance** during Assistant interactions.

**Tip:** Use modular Rulesets — combine **global**, **persona-specific**, and **compliance** Rulesets for layered behavior control.

## Example scenario

You want to create a Ruleset to enforce a polite, professional tone for a **Customer Support Assistant**.

Example configuration:

-   Name: `Polite Support Tone`
-   Description: `Ensures the Assistant maintains a polite and professional tone during customer interactions.`
-   Alias: `polite-support`
-   Metadata: `{ "version": "1.0", "author": "support_team" }`

Rules:

1.  **Use Formal Salutations**
    `Always begin responses with a polite greeting, such as "Hello," or "Good day,". Address the user respectfully if their name is known.`

2.  **Offer Assistance Clearly**
    `Clearly state how you can assist the user. For example, "How may I help you today?" or "I can assist you with..."`

After creation:

-   Assign the Ruleset to your **Customer Support Assistant**.

## Troubleshooting

### Ruleset not visible when configuring an Assistant

-   Ensure the Ruleset has at least one Rule.
-   Confirm the Ruleset was created successfully.

### Conflicting or ambiguous Rules

-   Review Rule text carefully — avoid **overlapping** or **contradictory** instructions.
-   Test Assistants with the Ruleset applied and refine as needed.

### Ruleset updates not reflected

-   Verify that the **Assistant configuration** references the latest Ruleset version.
-   Re-assign or refresh the Assistant if necessary.

## Best practices

-   Use **modular** Rulesets — separate compliance, tone, and persona guidelines.
-   Keep **Rules clear and unambiguous** — avoid conflicting instructions.
-   Implement **versioning** via Ruleset metadata.
-   Review Assistant responses regularly to validate behavior against assigned Rulesets.
