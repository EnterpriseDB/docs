description: How to create a Retriever in Gen AI Builder to control how your Assistants retrieve information from Knowledge Bases.
---

## Who is this for

Platform users who want to configure how their AI Assistants retrieve information from Knowledge Bases in Gen AI Builder.
Typical users include developers, AI architects, and conversational designers.

## What you will accomplish

You will create a **Retriever** in Gen AI Builder and configure it to target one or more Knowledge Bases.
You can then associate this Retriever with an Assistant to enable grounded, context-aware AI responses.

## Why create a Retriever

- Retrievers define **which Knowledge Bases** your Assistants search.
- They enable **semantic search** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
- They allow you to configure **token limits**, **metadata**, and more.
- Without a Retriever, an Assistant cannot access external content for grounding its responses.

For background, see:

- [Retrievers explained](../../../learn/explained/retrievers-explained)
- [Knowledge Bases explained](../../../learn/explained/knowledge-bases)
- [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](../../../learn/explained/rag)

## Complexity and time to complete

- **Complexity**: Low to moderate.
- **Estimated time**: 5–10 minutes.

## Pre-requisites

- One or more populated **Knowledge Bases** created in Gen AI Builder.

## How to create a Retriever

1. Navigate to **Retrievers** in the Gen AI Builder UI.
2. Select **Create Retriever**.

3. Configure the following fields:

### Name (required)

- Label: **Name your retriever**
- Action: Enter a clear, unique name.
Example: `Product Docs Retriever`

### Description (optional)

- Label: **Describe your retriever**
- Action: Add optional context about the Retriever’s purpose.
Example: `Retriever for product documentation and customer FAQs`

### Knowledge Bases (required)

- Label: **Select the knowledge bases that will be queried by this retriever.**
- Action: Select one or more existing Knowledge Bases.
Example: `PG Financial Product FAQs KB`, `PG Financial Account Services KB`

### Max Tokens (optional)

- Label: **Max Tokens**
- Action: Set a token limit for results returned by the Retriever.
Example: `2000`

**Note:**
Max Tokens controls how much content is passed to the LLM as context.

### Metadata (optional)

- Label: **Metadata should be a valid JSON object.**
- Action: Provide optional structured metadata in JSON format.
Example: `{"version": "1.0", "team": "AI Engineering"}`

## Finalizing creation

- Select **Create**.
- The Retriever will appear in the Retrievers list and is now available to assign to an Assistant.

## Associating a Retriever with an Assistant

- When configuring an Assistant, go to **Advanced Options**.
- Select one or more Retrievers to associate with the Assistant.
- This controls how the Assistant queries Knowledge Bases during operation.

## Example scenario

You want to create a Retriever for an Assistant that answers questions about product features and pricing.

Example configuration:

- Name: `Product Support Retriever`
- Description: `Fetches product specs and pricing from KBs`
- Knowledge Bases:
- `Product Catalog Hybrid KB`
- `Pricing Policies KB`
- Max Tokens: `2000`
- Metadata: `{"team": "Support AI"}`

## Troubleshooting

### Retriever not returning expected results

- Verify that the target Knowledge Bases contain relevant content.
- Check that your Max Tokens setting is appropriate (not too low).
- Review Assistant configuration — ensure the correct Retriever is assigned.

### Retriever not visible when configuring Assistant

- Confirm that the Retriever was created successfully.
- Ensure the target Knowledge Bases are accessible and indexed.

### Max Tokens impact

- Setting too high may exceed LLM context window and cause truncation.
- Setting too low may result in incomplete context.
