description: How to create a Retriever in Gen AI Builder to control how your Assistants retrieve information from Knowledge Bases.
---

## Who is this for

Platform users configuring **Retrievers** in **Gen AI Builder** in **Hybrid Manager AI Factory**.
Typical users include developers, AI architects, and conversational designers.

## What you will accomplish

You will create a **Retriever** to control **which Knowledge Bases** your Assistants query and **how** content is retrieved.

You will configure:

-   Target Knowledge Bases
-   Max Tokens limit
-   Optional metadata

Retrievers enable **grounded**, **context-aware** AI responses for your Assistants.

## Why create a Retriever

Retrievers are a key component of the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline:

-   Define which **Knowledge Bases** Assistants query.
-   Control **semantic search** and **context size** passed to the LLM.
-   Enable metadata injection for auditing, versioning, or custom logic.
-   Without a Retriever, an Assistant cannot retrieve content to ground its responses.

## Complexity and time to complete

-   **Complexity**: Low to moderate
-   **Estimated time**: 5–10 minutes

## When to create a Retriever

-   Before assigning **RAG capabilities** to an Assistant.
-   When tuning how an Assistant retrieves and prioritizes knowledge.
-   When combining content from **multiple Knowledge Bases**.
-   When customizing retrieval behavior for different personas or use cases.

## How to create a Retriever

### 1. Navigate to Retrievers

-   In Gen AI Builder UI, go to **Retrievers**.

### 2. Create a new Retriever

-   Click **Create Retriever**.

### 3. Configure Retriever fields

#### Name (required)

-   Provide a clear, unique name.
-   Example: `Product Docs Retriever`

#### Description (optional)

-   Describe the Retriever’s purpose or intended use.
-   Example: `Retriever for product documentation and customer FAQs.`

#### Knowledge Bases (required)

-   Select one or more existing **Knowledge Bases** to target.
-   Example: `PG Financial Product FAQs KB`, `PG Financial Account Services KB`

#### Max Tokens (optional)

-   Set the **Max Tokens** limit for context passed to the LLM.
-   Example: `2000`

**Guidance:**

-   Higher token limits → more context but larger LLM prompts.
-   Lower token limits → faster response but may miss needed content.
-   Typical range: **1000–3000**.

#### Metadata (optional)

-   Provide optional metadata as a valid JSON object.
-   Example: `{"version": "1.0", "team": "AI Engineering"}`

**Usage:**

-   Tag or version your Retriever configurations.
-   Drive advanced logic in custom Griptape Structures or Assistant templates.

### 4. Finalize creation

-   Click **Create**.
-   The new Retriever will appear in the **Retrievers** list.
-   It is now available to assign to one or more Assistants.

## Associating a Retriever with an Assistant

-   When configuring an **Assistant**, go to **Advanced Options**.
-   Select one or more Retrievers to associate.
-   This controls **which Knowledge Bases** the Assistant queries at runtime.

**Tip:** Use **different Retrievers** for different personas or Assistant use cases — enabling fine-grained RAG control.

## Example scenario

You want to create a Retriever for an Assistant that answers customer product questions:

-   Name: `Product Support Retriever`
-   Description: `Fetches product specs and pricing from KBs.`
-   Knowledge Bases:
-   `Product Catalog Hybrid KB`
-   `Pricing Policies KB`
-   Max Tokens: `2000`
-   Metadata: `{"team": "Support AI"}`

## Troubleshooting

### Retriever not returning expected results

-   Verify that the target **Knowledge Bases** contain relevant content.
-   Check your **Max Tokens** setting.
-   Confirm that the correct Retriever is assigned to the Assistant.

### Retriever not visible when configuring an Assistant

-   Ensure the Retriever was created successfully.
-   Verify that the selected Knowledge Bases are accessible and indexed.

### Token impact

-   Setting too high may exceed LLM context window → risk truncation.
-   Setting too low may result in incomplete or unhelpful responses.

**Tip:** Start with **2000 tokens** and adjust based on Assistant testing.
