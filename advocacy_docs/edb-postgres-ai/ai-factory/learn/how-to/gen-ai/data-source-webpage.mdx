description: How to configure a Web Page data source in Gen AI Builder to ingest content from publicly accessible websites.
---

## Who is this for

Platform users who want to bring web content into Gen AI Builder for use in Knowledge Bases and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. Typical users include developers, AI architects, and business owners working on contextual AI applications.

## What you will accomplish

You will configure a Web Page data source in Gen AI Builder to ingest selected web pages. The content will then be available for transformation and indexing into downstream Libraries and Knowledge Bases.

## Why use a Web Page data source

- Web pages often contain valuable, curated, and public-facing information that complements internal data sources.
- Adding relevant web content can enhance AI answers, RAG performance, and semantic search by expanding your Knowledge Base.
- Targeted ingestion of specific web pages ensures the system uses only high-quality and relevant external content.

For guidance on how Knowledge Bases and RAG applications use this content, see:

- [Knowledge Bases overview](../../../pipeline/knowledge_base)
- [Hybrid Manager Gen AI Builder overview](../../../../../hybrid-manager/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder)

## Key considerations

### Data relevance and quality

- Ingest web pages that contain useful, high-quality, and relevant content.
- Pages with structured and clearly written HTML are the most effective.
- Avoid dynamic pages that require JavaScript for key content.

### Scope of ingestion

- Target specific pages.
- Avoid adding entire websites or root-level URLs unless necessary, as this can result in large volumes of irrelevant data and higher processing costs.

### Compliance and terms of service

- Always respect the website's robots.txt file and terms of service.
- Ensure you are authorized to ingest the content for your intended use.

## How to configure a Web Page data source

1. In the interface where you manage data sources, select **+ Add New Data Source**.
2. Choose **Web Page** from the available data source types.
3. Configure the following fields:

- **Name**: Provide a clear and unique name. Example: `EDB Main Site FAQs`.
- **Description** (optional): Add descriptive context for future reference.
- **URLs**: Enter one or more full URLs of the web pages to ingest.
- Example: `https://www.enterprisedb.com/`
- Select **Add URL** to provide additional URLs.

4. (Optional) Configure advanced options:

- **Scheduled refresh**: Enable this option to automatically refresh the data on a schedule.
- Provide a cron expression. Example: `0 2 * * *` (daily at 2 AM).
- **Transform your data**: Enable this option to apply a PG.AI Structure that transforms the data during ingestion.
- Select an existing Structure from the list.

5. Select **Create** to add the Web Page data source.

## Supported content

- Text content from HTML pages.
- Limited support for client-side rendered content or heavily dynamic pages.

## Managing and refreshing the data source

Once created, the Web Page data source can be viewed and managed through the Data Sources interface.

Actions available:

- **Edit**: Modify the data source configuration.
- **Refresh**: Manually trigger a data ingestion job.
- **Delete**: Remove the data source.

You can also review the data job history to monitor ingestion performance and troubleshoot issues.

## Troubleshooting

### URL not accessible

- Check the URL for typos.
- Verify the page is public and not protected by login or access controls.

### No or incomplete content

- The page may rely on JavaScript for key content, which is not fully supported.
- Anti-scraping protections may block ingestion.
- Review the data job history. If 0 bytes were ingested, dynamic rendering may be the cause.

## Example scenario

You want to enrich your Knowledge Base with relevant articles from the public EDB website.

Example configuration:

- **Name**: `EDB Blog - Latest GenAI Articles`
- **URL**: `https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/category/genai`
- **Scheduled refresh**: `0 2 * * *` (daily at 2 AM)
- **Transform your data**: Use a Structure to strip unwanted boilerplate such as author bios.
