description: How to create a Knowledge Base in Gen AI Builder to organize content from your Libraries for AI applications.
---

## Who is this for

Platform users configuring **Knowledge Bases** in **Gen AI Builder** in **Hybrid Manager AI Factory**.
Typical users include developers, AI architects, and business owners managing Knowledge Bases for production AI applications.

## What you will accomplish

You will create a **Knowledge Base** by selecting one or more Libraries as its content source.

You can configure:

-   **Fully-managed vector stores**
-   **Self-managed Postgres vector stores**
-   **Hybrid Knowledge Bases** combining structured and unstructured data

You will prepare your Knowledge Base for use in:

-   AI Assistants
-   RAG pipelines
-   Semantic search applications

## Why use Knowledge Bases

Knowledge Bases provide the **queryable foundation** for Gen AI applications:

-   Power **semantic search** and **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**.
-   Enable LLM-based agents to retrieve content grounded in your data.
-   Combine structured metadata with rich unstructured text for advanced use cases.
-   Support refreshable pipelines — when source Libraries are updated, Knowledge Bases can be re-synced.

## Complexity and time to complete

-   **Complexity**: Low to moderate (depends on Knowledge Base type selected)
-   **Estimated time**: 5–15 minutes

## When to create a Knowledge Base

-   When preparing content for use in **Assistants**.
-   To enable **RAG pipelines**.
-   To deliver semantic search experiences.
-   To combine structured filters with AI-driven search (Hybrid KB).
-   After creating and validating **Libraries** with your source content.

## How to create a Knowledge Base

### 1. Navigate to Knowledge Bases

-   In Gen AI Builder UI, go to **Knowledge Bases**.

### 2. Create a new Knowledge Base

-   Click **Create Knowledge Base**.

### 3. Configure common fields

#### Name (required)

-   Provide a clear, unique name.
-   Example: `Company Policy KB`

#### Description (optional)

-   Describe the Knowledge Base’s purpose or intended use.

### 4. Select Knowledge Base type

Gen AI Builder supports **three Knowledge Base types**:

* * *

### PG.AI - Fully-Managed Vector Store

-   Create a vector-based Knowledge Base with a fully managed backend.
-   Optimized for unstructured text and general-purpose semantic search.

#### Configure:

-   **Libraries**: Select one or more Libraries.
-   Example: `HR Policy Documents Library`, `Employee Handbook Library`

#### Example

-   Name: `Company Policy KB`
-   Libraries selected: `HR Policy Documents Library`, `Employee Handbook Library`

* * *

### PG.AI Database - Self-Managed

-   Connect to your own Postgres-compatible database with AI/vector extensions.
-   Useful when you want full control over your vector store (ex: HCP-managed Postgres + AIDB).

#### Configure:

-   **Connection String**: Full connection string to your database.
-   Example: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`
-   **Password**: Database password.
-   **Libraries**: Select one or more Libraries.

#### Example

-   Name: `Tech Docs Self-Managed KB`
-   Connection String: `postgresql://user:password@host:5432/techdocs`
-   Password: `**********`
-   Library selected: `API Documentation Library`

* * *

### PG.AI Hybrid Database

-   Build a Hybrid Knowledge Base with both **structured filters** and **semantic search**.
-   Ideal for catalogs, customer profiles, and multi-attribute search experiences.

#### Configure:

-   **Libraries**: Select one or more Libraries (typically structured data sources such as CSV, Google Sheet).
-   **Structured Columns**:
-   Add columns used for filtering.
-   Define name, optional description, data type (Text, Number, Date, Boolean).
-   **Unstructured Columns**:
-   Add columns used for semantic search embeddings.
-   Define name and optional description.

#### Example

-   Name: `Product Catalog Hybrid KB`
-   Library selected: `Product CSV Library`
-   Structured Columns:
-   `SKU` (Text)
-   `Price` (Number)
-   Unstructured Columns:
-   `ProductName`
-   `Features`

* * *

### 5. Finalize creation

-   Click **Create**.
-   The system will build and populate your Knowledge Base from the selected Libraries.
-   Progress is visible in the **Knowledge Bases** list view.

## Example scenario

You want to build a Hybrid Knowledge Base to power product search and filtering in your AI Assistant.

Example configuration:

-   Name: `Product Catalog Hybrid KB`
-   Library selected: `Product CSV Library`
-   Structured Columns:
-   `SKU` (Text)
-   `Price` (Number)
-   Unstructured Columns:
-   `ProductName`
-   `Features`

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Libraries

-   Verify that your source Libraries are created and populated.
-   Hybrid Knowledge Bases require Libraries with defined schemas.

### Connection errors (Self-Managed)

-   Validate your database connection string and credentials.
-   Ensure required extensions (pgvector, AIDB) are installed.
-   Confirm that your database is reachable from Gen AI Builder.

### Incomplete indexing (Hybrid KB)

-   Verify correct columns were selected for structured and unstructured indexing.
-   Column names must match the Library schema.
