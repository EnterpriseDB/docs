description: How to create a Knowledge Base in Gen AI Builder to organize content from your Libraries for AI applications.
---

## Who is this for

Platform users who want to create Knowledge Bases to support AI applications that deliver context-aware responses.
Typical users include developers, AI architects, and business owners managing Knowledge Bases in production environments.

## What you will accomplish

You will create a Knowledge Base in Gen AI Builder by selecting one or more Libraries as its content source.
You can choose between fully managed vector stores, self-managed databases, or hybrid Knowledge Bases that combine structured and unstructured data.

## Why use Knowledge Bases

- Knowledge Bases provide a consistent, queryable foundation for AI applications.
- They power semantic search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by organizing embedded content.
- You can manage updates to Knowledge Bases by refreshing source Libraries and re-syncing Knowledge Bases.
- Hybrid Knowledge Bases let you combine structured metadata with rich unstructured text, supporting advanced AI use cases.

For background, see:

## Complexity and time to complete

- **Complexity**: Low to moderate (depends on Knowledge Base type selected).
- **Estimated time**: 5â€“15 minutes.

## How to create a Knowledge Base

1. Navigate to **Knowledge Bases** in the Gen AI Builder UI.
2. Select **Create Knowledge Base**.

### Common fields

- **Name**: Provide a clear, unique name. (Required.)
Example: `Company Policy KB`
- **Description**: Optional text to describe the Knowledge Base.

### Select the type of Knowledge Base

Gen AI Builder supports three Knowledge Base types:

### 1. PG.AI - Fully-Managed Vector Store

Use this option to create a vector-based Knowledge Base with a fully managed backend.

- **Data Sources**: Select one or more Libraries to populate the Knowledge Base.
- Example Libraries: `HR Policy Documents Library`, `Employee Handbook Library`

This is ideal for unstructured text content and general-purpose semantic search.

#### Example

- Name: `Company Policy KB`
- Libraries selected: `HR Policy Documents Library`, `Employee Handbook Library`

### 2. PG.AI Database - Self-Managed

Use this option to connect to an existing PostgreSQL-compatible database with AI/vector extensions.

- **Connection String**: Enter the full connection string for your database.
- Example: `postgresql://user:password@host:port/dbname`
- **Password**: Enter the password for the database user.
- **Data Sources**: Select one or more Libraries to populate the Knowledge Base.

This is suitable if you want to control your own database infrastructure, typically an HCP-managed Postgres instance with AIDB or pgvector.

#### Example

- Name: `Tech Docs Self-Managed KB`
- Connection String: `postgresql://user:password@host:5432/techdocs`
- Password: `**********`
- Library selected: `API Documentation Library`

### 3. PG.AI - Hybrid Database (for Structured/Unstructured Data)

Use this option when your source data is structured (CSV, Google Sheet) and you want to combine structured filters with unstructured semantic search.

- **Data Sources**: Select one or more Libraries (usually from structured sources).
- **Structured Columns**:
- Add one or more structured columns.
- Provide the column name, optional description, and select data type (Text, Number, Date, Boolean).
- **Unstructured Columns**:
- Add one or more unstructured columns (text fields to embed for semantic search).
- Provide the column name and optional description.

This is ideal for product catalogs, customer profiles, or any hybrid data scenario.

#### Example

- Name: `Product Catalog Hybrid KB`
- Library selected: `Product CSV Library`
- Structured Columns:
- `SKU` (Text)
- `Price` (Number)
- Unstructured Columns:
- `ProductName`
- `Features`

## Finalizing creation

After configuring the Knowledge Base:

- Select **Create**.
- The system will build the Knowledge Base and begin populating it from your selected Libraries.
- You can monitor progress in the Knowledge Bases list view.

## Troubleshooting

### Missing Libraries

- Ensure that the source Libraries you want to use have been created and are populated.

### Connection errors (Self-Managed)

- Verify that the database connection string and password are correct.
- Check that your database is configured with required extensions (pgvector, AIDB) and is reachable from Gen AI Builder.

### Incomplete indexing (Hybrid KB)

- Check that the correct columns were selected for structured and unstructured indexing.
- Verify column names match exactly with the source Library schema.

## Example scenario

You want to create a unified Knowledge Base for your product catalog.

Example configuration:

- Name: `Product Catalog Hybrid KB`
- Library selected: `Product CSV Library`
- Structured Columns:
- `SKU` (Text)
- `Price` (Number)
- Unstructured Columns:
- `ProductName`
- `Features`
