description: How to create a Structure in Gen AI Builder by deploying a Griptape-powered agent, pipeline, or workflow from a Zip file.
---

## Who is this for

Platform users building advanced AI workflows in Gen AI Builder using Griptape Structures.
Typical users include developers, AI architects, and data engineers.

## What you will accomplish

You will create a **Structure** in Gen AI Builder by deploying a Griptape-powered agent, pipeline, or workflow.
You will configure the Structure and prepare it for execution.

## Why create a Structure

- Structures enable **advanced AI workflows** beyond basic chat.
- They allow you to:
- Transform data in Data Sources.
- Act as Tools callable by Assistants.
- Implement custom Data Sources and Retrievers.
- Package and reuse business logic in AI Factory.

- [AI Factory Concepts](../../../learn/explained/ai-factory-concepts)
- [Hybrid Manager: Using Gen AI Builder](../../../../hybrid-manager/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder/index)

## Complexity and time to complete

- **Complexity**: Moderate
- **Estimated time**: 10â€“20 minutes

## Pre-requisites

- Griptape Structure packaged as a Zip file:
- Includes Structure code + dependencies.
- Includes Structure configuration (typically YAML).
- Structure Zip file uploaded to Data Lake.

## How to create a Structure

### 1. Navigate to Structures

- Go to **Structures** in the Gen AI Builder UI.
This may appear under **APPS**, **TOOLS**, or a dedicated category.

### 2. Create a new Structure

- Click **Create Structure**.

### 3. Select creation method

- Use **Create Structure from Zip file**.

### 4. Configure Structure fields

#### Name (required)

- Label: **Name of your Structure**
- Action: Enter a unique and descriptive name.
Example: `PGFT_TransactionCategorizer`

#### Description (optional)

- Label: **Description of your Structure**
- Action: Describe what the Structure does.
Example: `Categorizes financial transactions using PGFT business logic.`

### 5. Configure Data Lake parameters

#### Bucket Id (required)

- Label: **Select a PG.AI Bucket**
- Action: Select the Data Lake bucket where your Structure Zip is stored.

#### Asset Path (required)

- Label: **your-folder/structure-code.zip**
- Action: Enter the full path to your Zip file inside the bucket.
Example: `griptape-structures/transaction_categorizer.zip`

### 6. Configure Structure Config parameters

#### Structure Config File (recommended)

- Label: **Path to the structure configuration file in your zip file**
- Action: Enter relative path inside the Zip to the Structure Config file.
Example: `structure_config.yaml`

### 7. Configure environment variables (optional)

#### Add individual variables

- Instruction: Set environment variables that will be passed to the Structure.

For each variable:

- **Type:** Variable (or Secret if supported).
- **Name:** e.g. `API_KEY`
- **Value:** e.g. `your_actual_api_key_here`

#### Import .env file

- Optionally paste `.env` file contents to bulk import variables.

### 8. Finalize creation

- Click **Create** to deploy the Structure.

Deployment steps:

- System unzips the file.
- Sets up runtime environment.
- Makes the Structure available for execution.

### 9. Verify deployment

- The new Structure will appear in the Structures list.
- Monitor deployment **Status**.
- You can:
- Run Structure directly.
- Use it as a Tool in an Assistant.
- Use it in a Data Source pipeline.

## Example: Deploy a Transaction Categorizer Structure

1. Package Griptape Structure `TransactionCategorizer`.
2. Upload to Data Lake:
- Bucket: `pgai-structures`
- Path: `transaction_categorizer/transaction_categorizer.zip`
3. Create Structure:
- Name: `PGFT_TransactionCategorizer`
- Description: `Categorizes financial transactions.`
- Bucket Id: `pgai-structures`
- Asset Path: `transaction_categorizer/transaction_categorizer.zip`
- Structure Config File: `structure_config.yaml`
4. Add env variables:
- Name: `MODEL_API_KEY`
- Value: `your_key_here`
5. Click **Create**.

Next steps:

- Run Structure via UI or API.
- Assign Structure as Tool to an Assistant.

## Troubleshooting

### Structure deploy fails

- Verify Zip file contents:
- Structure code is correct.
- Structure Config file is present and correctly referenced.
- Check Data Lake path is correct and accessible.

### Environment variables not working

- Confirm variables are added correctly.
- If using Secret type, verify secrets are configured properly.

### Structure not appearing as Tool

- Ensure the Structure defines an appropriate Tool interface.
- Check that it is published and Tool-compatible.
