## Overview

Performing a Lakehouse Sync is a way to capture information from a transactional database at a point in time and sync that information to a Managed Store Location (MSL).

The Lakehouse sync process organizes the transactional database data into Lakehouse tables stored in the MSL. This process allows the data to be queried by a Lakehouse node, which is optimized for higher-performance queries using a vectorized query engine designed for Lakehouse tables.

## Performing a Lakehouse Sync

### Prerequisites

- a Postgres cluster hosted and managed by EDB Postgres AIÂ® Cloud Service

### Navigate to Lakehouse Sync

1. Go to the [EDB Postgres AI Console](https://portal.biganimal.com/beacon).

2. From the landing page, select the project with the database instance you want to sync. If it's not shown on the landing page, select the **View Projects** link in the **Projects** section and select your project from there.

3. Select the **Migrate** dropdown in the left navigation bar and then select **Migrations**.

4. Select the **Create New Migration** button.

### Define Lakehouse Sync

5. Give the sync a **Name**, then select a **Source Cluster** and the **Database** you want to sync.

6. If you have already created an MSL you want to use, select that MSL from the list of available MSLs and move on to [Selecting Tables](#selecting-tables) below. If not, select the **Create New Managed Storage Location** button to open the **Add Managed Storage Location** dialog.

7. Select the AWS region for the new MSL.

8. Set a location prefix in the form near the bottom of the **Add Managed Storage Location** dialog to complete the definition of the MSL. A location prefix is a unique name used to identify any resources and assets associated with the MSL.

9. Select the **Create Managed Storage Location** button.

### Selecting Tables

10. Select the **Tables** tab next to the **Get Started** tab near the top of the page and select which tables and columns you wish to be included in the migration.

### Start Lakehouse Sync

11. Select the **Start Lakehouse Sync** button.

12. If successful, you'll see your Lakehouse sync with the 'Creating' status under 'MOST RECENT' migrations on the Migrations page. The time taken to perform a sync can depend upon how much data is being synchronized and may take several hours. 

!!! Note
The first sync in a project will take a couple of hours due to the provisioning of the required infrastructure.
