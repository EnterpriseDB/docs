## Overview

Performing a Lakehouse Sync is a way to capture information from a transactional database at a point in time and sync that information to a Managed Store Location (MSL).

The Lakehouse sync process organizes the transactional database data into Lakehouse tables stored in the MSL. This process allows the data to be queried by a Lakehouse node which is optimized for higher-performance queries using a vectorized query engine designed for Lakehouse tables.

## Performing a Lakehouse Sync

### Prerequisites

- a Postgres® cluster running on your EDB Postgres AI® Cloud Service account

### Navigate to Lakehouse Sync

1. Go to the [EDB Postgres AI Console]().

2. From the landing page, select the project with the database instance you want to sync. If it is not shown on the landing page, select the **View Projects** link in the **Projects** section and select your project from there.

3. Select the **Migrate** dropdown in the left navigation bar and then select **Migrations**.

4. Select the **Create New Migration** button.

### Define Lakehouse Sync

5. Give the sync a **Name**, then select a **Source Cluster** and the **Database** you want to sync.

6. If you have already created an MSL you want to use, select that MSL from the list of available MSLs and skip to step 10. If not, select the **Create New Managed Storage Location** button to bring up the **Add Managed Storage Location** modal.

7. Select the radio button next to the AWS region in which you want to create your new MSL.

8. Define a location prefix in the form near the bottom of the modal to complete the definition of the MSL.

9. Select the **Create Managed Storage Location** button.

10. Select the **Tables** tab next to the **Get Started** tab near the top of the page and select which tables and columns you wish to be included in the migration.

### Start Lakehouse Sync

11. Select the **Start Lakehouse Sync** button.

12. If successful, you will see your Lakehouse sync start. Syncs can take as long as a few hours, especially the first time when creating a new migration in a project.
