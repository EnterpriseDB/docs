description: Understand how the EDB Postgres Lakehouse architecture supports fast, scalable analytics on modern data lake storage.

EDB Postgres® Lakehouse brings modern lakehouse architecture to Postgres-based analytics.

It enables fast SQL-based analytics on data stored in object storage (S3-compatible), using open table formats such as Apache Iceberg and Delta Lake.

For implementation and management in Hybrid Manager (HM), see [Lakehouse clusters in EDB Hybrid Manager](../hybrid-manager/analytics/lakehouse).

## What is the EDB Postgres Lakehouse

EDB Postgres Lakehouse is an architecture pattern and set of capabilities that:

- Integrate Postgres with modern lakehouse patterns
- Provide fast, scalable analytics on data in object storage
- Use vectorized query execution and columnar storage formats
- Leverage open table formats for interoperability and data governance

## Why Lakehouse matters for EDB analytics

Lakehouse enables Analytics Accelerator users to:

- Run fast SQL analytics on object storage — no data movement required
- Implement separation of storage and compute for cost efficiency
- Support interoperability with external tools (Spark, Trino, Flink, data science frameworks)
- Query PGD Tiered Tables offloaded to Iceberg seamlessly
- Enable unified OLTP + OLAP architectures with Postgres at the center

## How EDB implements Lakehouse architecture

Core components:

- **EDB Postgres Lakehouse Nodes**:
- Stateless analytical compute nodes
- Provisioned and managed via Hybrid Manager (HM) or self-managed
- **Vectorized query engine**:
- Powered by [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/)
- Processes data in Parquet and other columnar formats efficiently
- **PGAA**:
- Postgres extensions enabling Lakehouse behavior:
- External tables over Iceberg and Delta Lake
- Unified access to PGD hot data + offloaded cold data
- **PGFS**:
- Unified access layer to object storage
- Supports S3, GCS, MinIO, Azure Data Lake Storage, and compatible systems
- **Open table formats**:
- Apache Iceberg (full support including catalogs)
- Delta Lake (read-only support)
