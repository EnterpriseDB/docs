# EDB Postgres Lakehouse

EDB Postgres Lakehouse extends Postgres with scalable, high-performance analytics on data stored in cost-effective object storage. It combines modern data lakehouse architecture with the flexibility and power of Postgres.

This page provides an overview of EDB Postgres Lakehouse. For more detail, see [EDB Postgres Lakehouse: Detailed concepts and terminology](../reference/overview).

For deployment and management in Hybrid Manager (HM), see [EDB Postgres Lakehouse clusters in Hybrid Manager](../../hm_analytics_spoke_root_v2).

## Vision

EDB Postgres Lakehouse enables a unified data platform that bridges operational and analytical workloads.

Key goals:

- **Analytics on your terms:** Run analytical queries directly on or near operational data, reducing ETL overhead.
- **Performance at scale:** Leverage vectorized engines and columnar storage for high-speed analytics on large datasets.
- **Openness and interoperability:** Use open table formats (Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake) for flexibility and ecosystem compatibility.
- **Cost-effective data management:** Store large analytical datasets in object storage; separate compute and storage for cost efficiency.
- **Extending Postgres:** Continue using SQL, Postgres clients, and BI tools with enhanced analytical capabilities.

## Major components

### Lakehouse nodes

Specialized EDB Postgres instances (Advanced Server or Extended Server) act as compute engines for the Lakehouse.

Features:

- Vectorized query engine (Apache DataFusion)
- PGAA extensions for querying external object storage
- Stateless and scalable

### Lakehouse tables

Defined in your Postgres schema, but data resides in object storage (S3, GCS, etc.):

- Stored in columnar formats (Parquet)
- Managed with open table formats (Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake)

### Storage locations (PGFS)

The Postgres File System (PGFS) defines storage locations:

- Configures connection and path to object storage
- Enables Postgres to interact with Lakehouse tables

### Vectorized query engine

Lakehouse nodes process data using a vectorized engine (Apache DataFusion):

- Operates on columnar data in batches (vectors)
- Delivers significant query performance gains
