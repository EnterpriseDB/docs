_EDB Postgres Lakehouse extends the power of Postgres to analytical workloads,
by adding a vectorized query engine and separating storage from compute. Building
a Data Lakehouse has never been easier – just use Postgres._

## Rapid Analytics for Postgres

Postgres Lakehouse is a core offering of the EDB Postgres® AI platform, extending
Postgres to support analytical queries over columnar data in object storage,
while keeping the simplicity and ease of use that Postgres users love.

With Postgres Lakehouse, you can query your Postgres data with a Lakehouse Node,
an ephemeral, scale-to-zero compute resource powered by Postgres that’s optimized for
vectorized query execution over columnar data.

## Postgres Native

Never leave the Postgres ecosystem.

Postgres Lakehouse nodes run either EDB Advanced Server (EPAS) or EDB Postgres
Extended (PGE) as the Postgres engine, with data for analytics stored as
columnar tables in object storage using the open source Delta Lake protocol.

EDB Postgres Lakehouse is “just Postgres” – you can query it with any Postgres
client, and it fully supports all Postgres queries, functions and statements, so
there’s no need to change existing queries or reconfigure business
intelligence software.

## Vectorized Execution

Postgres Lakehouse uses Apache DataFusion’s vectorized SQL query engine to
execute analytical queries 5-100x faster (30x on average) compared to native
Postgres, while still falling back to native execution when necessary.

## Columnar Storage

Postgres Lakehouse is optimized to query "Lakehouse Tables" in object storage,
extending the power of open source database to open table formats. Currently,
it supports querying "Delta Tables" stored according to the Delta Lake protocol.

## Lakehouse Sync

You can sync your own data from tables in transactional sources (initially, EDB
Postgres AI Cloud Service databases) into Lakehouse Tables in Storage Locations
(initially, managed locations in S3 object storage).

## Fully Managed Service

You can launch Postgres Lakehouse nodes using the EDB Postgres AI Cloud
Service (formerly EDB BigAnimal). Point a Lakehouse Node at a storage bucket
with some Delta Tables in it, and get results of analytical (OLAP) queries in
less time than if you queried the same data in a transactional Postgres database.

Postgres Lakehouse nodes are available now for customers using
EDB Postgres AI - Hosted environments on AWS, and will be rolling out
to additional cloud environments soon.

## Try Today

It’s easy to start using Postgres Lakehouse. Provision a Lakehouse Node in five
minutes, and start qureying pre-loaded benchmark data like TPC-H, TPC-DS,
Clickbench, and the 1 Billion Row challenge.
