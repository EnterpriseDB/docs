# Analytics Accelerator

Use the **Analytics Accelerator** to explore the analytical capabilities built on EDB Postgres®. This accelerator helps you understand core concepts, explore key technologies such as EDB Postgres® Lakehouse, and learn how to implement analytics with EDB Hybrid Manager (HM).

We integrate modern data architectures and open standards with the reliability and flexibility of Postgres to help you unlock valuable insights.

## Navigating the analytics accelerator

The accelerator organizes content into four areas:

- **Conceptual foundations**
Build your understanding of analytics principles and EDB’s approach.

- **EDB core analytics technologies**
Learn about EDB solutions and technologies that power our analytics offerings.

- **Practical guidance and solutions**
Find use cases, persona-based guides, how-to articles, and tutorials.

- **Product-specific implementations**
Access documentation for how these analytics capabilities surface and are managed in EDB products, such as EDB Hybrid Manager.
