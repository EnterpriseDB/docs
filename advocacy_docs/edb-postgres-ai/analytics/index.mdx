EDB delivers Analytics capabilities for Postgres, enabling you to run analytical queries over large datasets and more. 
And EDB Analytics lets you do it all in the Postgres ecosystem wherever you need it.

## Concepts

- **Why?**: The need for analytics in Postgres arises from the growing demand for data-driven decision-making and the need to analyze large datasets efficiently.
- **Analytics Engine**: A vectorized SQL query engine that executes analytical queries over columnar data in object storage, built on Apache DataFusion and optimized for performance.
- **Lakehouse**: A data architecture that combines the best of data lakes and data warehouses, allowing you to store and analyze data in a single platform.
- **Storage locations**: The physical or logical locations where data is stored, such as S3 buckets or on-premises storage systems.
- **Catalog**: A metadata repository that stores information about the data stored in a Lakehouse, including table definitions, schemas, and data locations.
- **Tiered Tables**: A feature of EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) that allows you to store data in different storage locations based on its usage patterns, optimizing performance and cost.

## Use cases

- *Read-only analytics without a Catalog*
  - "I need to run analytical queries over S3 delta tables and I want to use Postgres"
  - "I need to run analytical queries over Iceberg data and I want to use Postgres"
- *Read-write analytics without a Catalog*
  - "I need to offload data to S3 while keeping it available for analytics"
  - "I need to offload tables data to S3 while keeping it available for queries and analytics"
- *Read-write analytics with a Catalog*
  - "I want to read and write data to a Catalog"
- *Lakehouse read-only analytics*
  - "I need a Managed Lakehouse to read and analyze data stored as Delta Tables, Iceberg or a Catalog"

EDB Postgres Lakehouse extends the power of Postgres to analytical workloads,
by adding a vectorized query engine and separating storage from compute. Building
a data Lakehouse has never been easier: just use Postgres.

## Rapid analytics for Postgres

Postgres Lakehouse is a core offering of the EDB Postgres® AI platform, extending
Postgres to support analytical queries over columnar data in object storage,
while keeping the simplicity and ease of use that Postgres users love.

With Postgres Lakehouse, you can query your Postgres data with a Lakehouse node,
an ephemeral, scale-to-zero compute resource powered by Postgres that's optimized for
vectorized query execution over columnar data.

## Postgres native

Never leave the Postgres ecosystem.

Postgres Lakehouse nodes run either EDB Advanced Server (EPAS) or EDB Postgres
Extended (PGE) as the Postgres engine, with data for analytics stored as
columnar tables in object storage using the open source Delta Lake protocol.

EDB Postgres Lakehouse is “just Postgres” – you can query it with any Postgres
client, and it fully supports all Postgres queries, functions and statements, so
there's no need to change existing queries or reconfigure business
intelligence software.

## Vectorized execution

Postgres Lakehouse uses Apache DataFusion's vectorized SQL query engine to
execute analytical queries 5-100x faster (30x on average) compared to native
Postgres, while still falling back to native execution when necessary.

## Columnar storage

Postgres Lakehouse is optimized to query "Lakehouse Tables" in object storage,
extending the power of open source database to open table formats. Currently,
it supports querying "Delta Tables" stored according to the Delta Lake protocol.
