# Analytics Accelerator

Use the **Analytics Accelerator** to explore the analytical capabilities built on EDB Postgres®. This accelerator helps you understand core concepts, explore key technologies such as EDB Postgres® Lakehouse, and learn how to implement analytics with EDB Hybrid Manager (HM).

We integrate modern data architectures and open standards with the reliability and flexibility of Postgres to help you unlock valuable insights.

## Navigating the analytics accelerator

The accelerator organizes content into four areas:

- **Conceptual foundations**
Build your understanding of analytics principles and EDB’s approach.

- **EDB core analytics technologies**
Learn about EDB solutions and technologies that power our analytics offerings.

- **Practical guidance and solutions**
Find use cases, persona-based guides, how-to articles, and tutorials.

- **Product-specific implementations**
Access documentation for how these analytics capabilities surface and are managed in EDB products, such as EDB Hybrid Manager.

- [HM Analytics Spoke (Analytics in EDB Hybrid Manager)](#) *(Coming soon)*
Access documentation for analytics features in EDB Hybrid Manager. This includes HM Lakehouse clusters, using Iceberg, Delta, and tiered tables in HM, and HM-specific tutorials.

## Where to start

- Start with [Generic analytics concepts](learn/explained/generic-concepts.mdx) and [Lakehouse overview](lakehouse) to understand core ideas.
- Explore practical guidance when available.
- Use product-specific documentation when working with EDB Hybrid Manager.

Postgres Lakehouse is built using a number of technologies:

-   PostgreSQL
-   [Seafowl](https://seafowl.io/), an analytical database
-   [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/), the query engine used by Seafowl
-   [Delta Lake](https://delta.io) (and specifically [delta-rs](https://github.com/delta-io/delta-rs)),
for implementing the storage and retrieval layer of Delta Tables

### Level 100

The most important thing to understand about Postgres Lakehouse is that it
separates storage from compute. This design allows you to scale them independently,
which is ideal for analytical workloads where queries can be unpredictable and
spiky. You wouldn't want to keep a machine mostly idle just to hold data on
its attached hard drives. Instead, you can keep data in object storage (and also
in highly compressible formats), and only provision the compute needed to query
it when necessary.

On the compute side, a vectorized query engine is optimized to query Lakehouse
tables but still fall back to Postgres for full compatibility.

On the storage side, Lakehouse tables are stored using highly compressible
columnar storage formats optimized for analytics.
