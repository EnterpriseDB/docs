description: Supported cloud providers and regions for Lakehouse
---

**AWS only**: Currently, support for all Lakehouse features (Lakehouse nodes,
Managed Storage Locations, and Lakehouse Sync) is limited to AWS.

**Hybrid Control Plane only**: Support is limited to
ONLY **EDB PostgresÂ® AI Hybrid Control Plane** environments on AWS.

This means you can select from one of the following regions:

* North America
  * US East 1
  * US East 2
  * US West 2
* Europe
  * EU Central 1
  * EU West 1
  * EU West 2
* Asia
  * AP South 1
* Australia
  * AP SouthEast 2

To be precise:

* Lakehouse nodes can only be provisioned on AWS regions of a Hybrid Control Plane deployment.  
* Managed Storage Locations can only be created in AWS regions.
* Lakehouse Sync can only sync from source databases in AWS regions.

These limitations will be removed as we continue to improve the product. Eventually, we will support Azure and GCP, for all Lakehouse use cases.
