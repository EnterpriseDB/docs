description: Supported cloud providers and regions for Lakehouse
---

**AWS only**: Currently, support for all Lakehouse features (Lakehouse nodes,
Managed Storage Locations, and Lakehouse Sync) is limited to AWS.

**EDB-hosted only**: "Bring Your Own Account" (BYOA) regions are NOT currently
supported for Lakehouse resources. Support is limited to
ONLY **EDB PostgresÂ® AI Hosted** environments on AWS (a.k.a. "EDB-Hosted AWS regions").

This means you can select from one of the following regions:

* North America
  * US East 1
  * US East 2
  * US West 2
* Europe
  * EU Central 1
  * EU West 1
  * EU West 2
* Asia
  * AP South 1
* Australia
  * AP SouthEast 2

To be precise:

* Lakehouse nodes can only be provisioned in EDB-hosted AWS regions
* Managed Storage Locations can only be created in EDB-hosted AWS regions
* Lakehouse Sync can only sync from source databases in EDB-hosted AWS regions

These limitations will be removed as we continue to improve the product. Eventually,
we will support BYOA, as well as Azure and GCP, for all Lakehouse use cases.
