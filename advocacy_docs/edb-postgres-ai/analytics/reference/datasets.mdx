description: Benchmarking datasets available for Lakehouse
---

When you provision a Lakehouse node, it comes pre-configured to point to a public
S3 bucket in its same region, containing sample benchmarking datasets.

You can query tables in these datasets by referencing them with their schema
name.

| Schema Name     | Dataset                      |
| --------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `tpcds_sf_1`    | TPC-DS, Scale Factor 1       |
| `tpcds_sf_10`   | TPC-DS, Scale Factor 10      |
| `tpcds_sf_100`  | TPC-DS, Scale Factor 100     |
| `tpcds_sf_1000` | TPC-DS, Scale Factor 1000    |
| `tpch_sf_1`     | TPC-H, Scale Factor 1        |
| `tpch_sf_10`    | TPC-H, Scale Factor 10       |
| `tpch_sf_100`   | TPC-H, Scale Factor 100      |
| `tpch_sf_1000`  | TPC-H, Scale Factor 1000     |
| `clickbench`    | ClickBench, 100 million rows |
| `brc_1b`        | Billion row challenge        |

!!!note Notes about ClickBench data:

Data columns (`EventData`) are integers, not dates.

You must quote ClickBench column names, because they contain uppercase letters,
but unquoted identifiers in Postgres are case-insensitive. For example:

✅ `select "Title" from clickbench.hits;`

🚫 `select Title from clickbench.hits;`
!!!
