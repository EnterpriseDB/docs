Postgres Lakehouse is fastest when it can "push down" your entire query to
DataFusion, the vectorized query used for handling queries when possible. (In the
future, this will be more fine-grained as we add support for partial pushdowns.)

Postgres Lakehouse can execute your query in two modes. First, it attempts to
run the entire query using Seafowl (a dedicated columnar database based on
DataFusion).  If Seafowl can't run the entire query, for example, because it
uses PostgreSQL-specific operations like JSON, then Postgres Lakehouse will fall
back to using the PostgreSQL executor, with Seafowl streaming full table
contents to it.

If your query is extremely slow, it's possible that's what's happening.

You can check which mode is being used by running an `EXPLAIN` on the query and
making sure that the top-most query node is `DirectScan`. For example:

```
explain select count from (select count(*) from tpch_sf_1.lineitem);
                                                                                                                               QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 Aggregate  (cost=167.52..167.55 rows=1 width=8)
   ->  Append  (cost=0.00..165.01 rows=1001 width=0)
         ->  CompatScan on "16529" lineitem_2  (cost=100.00..150.00 rows=1000 width=0)
               SeafowlPlan: logical_plan
                 TableScan:  tpch_sf_1.lineitem projection=[l_orderkey, l_partkey, l_suppkey, l_linenumber, l_quantity, l_extendedprice, l_discount, l_tax, l_returnflag, l_linestatus, l_shipdate, l_commitdate, l_receiptdate, l_shipinstruct, l_shipmode, l_comment]
(6 rows)
```


In this case, the query is executed by PostgreSQL and Seafowl is only involved when scanning the table (see `CompatScan` at the bottom). 
The fix in this case is to explicitly name the inner `COUNT(*)` column, since Seafowl gives it an implicit name `count(*)` whereas PostgreSQL calls it `count`:

```console
edb_admin=> explain select count from (select count(*) as count from tpch_sf_1.lineitem);
                             QUERY PLAN
--------------------------------------------------------------------
 DirectScan: logical_plan
   Projection:  COUNT(*) AS count
     Aggregate:  groupBy=[[]], aggr=[[COUNT(UInt8(1)) AS COUNT(*)]]
       TableScan:  tpch_sf_1.lineitem projection=[]
(4 rows)
```

Here, we can see the `DirectScan` at the top, which means that Seafowl is running the entire query.

If you're having trouble rewording your query to make it run fully on Seafowl, open a support ticket.
