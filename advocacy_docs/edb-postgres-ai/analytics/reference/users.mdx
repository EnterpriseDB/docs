When you provision a Lakehouse node, you must provide a password. We do not
save this password. You will need it to login as the `edb_admin` user. This is
not a superuser account, but it does have the ability to create users and roles
and grants. Thus, you can either share the credentials for `edb_admin` itself,
or you can create other users and distribute those.
