## Creating Delta Tables

* You can use the [deltalake](https://pypi.org/project/deltalake/) Python library
to create Delta Tables and write to the bucket
* You can also use the [`lakehouse-loader`](https://github.com/splitgraph/lakehouse-loader) utility
we created for this, to export data from an arbitrary Postgres instance to Lakehouse Tables
in a storage bucket.

For example, with the `lakehouse-loader` utility:

```bash
export PGPASSWORD="..."
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="..."
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="..."
# export other AWS envvars

./lakehouse-loader postgres-to-delta postgres://test-user@localhost:5432/test-db -q "SELECT * FROM some_table" s3://my-bucket/my_schema/my_table
```
