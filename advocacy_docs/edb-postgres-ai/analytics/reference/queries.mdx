description: Supported queries in Lakehouse and best practices when composing them

In general, **READ ONLY** queries are supported. You cannot write directly to
object storage. This includes all Postgres built-in functions, statements
and types. It also includes any of those provided by EPAS or PGE, depending on
which distribution you choose to deploy.

In general, you cannot insert, update, delete or otherwise modify data. You
cannot `CREATE TABLE`. You must load data into the bucket out-of-band, either
with your own ETL scripts or with Lakehouse Sync.  See "Advanced: Bring Your Own
Data" for more details. (In the future, we will be making this more usable with
a custom DDL).

One exception is Postgres system tables, such as those used for storing users,
roles, and grants. These tables are stored on the local block device, which is
included in backups and restores. So you can `CREATE USER` or `CREATE ROLE` or
`GRANT USAGE`, and these users/roles/grants will survive restarts and restores.

## Gotcha: Do not set `search_path`

Do not set `search_path`. Always reference fully qualified table names.

Using `search_path` makes Lakehouse fall back to PostgreSQL,
dramatically impacting query performance. To avoid this, qualify all table names
in your query with a schema.

For example:

**ðŸš« Do NOT do this!**

```sql
--- DO NOT DO THIS
SET search_path = tpch_sf_10;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM lineitem;
```

**âœ… Do this instead!**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tpch_sf_10.lineitem
```
