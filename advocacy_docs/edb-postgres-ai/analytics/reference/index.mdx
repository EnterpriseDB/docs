EDB Postgres® AI Lakehouse is an early product. Eventually, it will support deployment
modes across multiple clouds and on-premises. However, currently it's fairly
limited in terms of where you can deploy it and what data you can query with it.

To get the best experience with Lakehouse, you should follow the
"quick start" guide to query benchmarking data. Then you can try loading your
own data with Lakehouse Sync. If you're intrigued, reach out to us and
we can talk more about your use case and potential opportunities.

This section details some of the important things you should know.
