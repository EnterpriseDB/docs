EDB Postgres® AI Lakehouse is an early product. Eventually, it will support deployment modes across multiple clouds and on-premises. 
However, currently it's fairly limited in terms of where you can deploy it and what data you can query with it.

To get the best experience with Lakehouse, you should follow the [Quick start](../quick_start) to query benchmarking data.
Then you can try loading your own data with Lakehouse Sync or you can bring your own data and use [external tables](../external_tables).
If you're intrigued, reach out to us and we can talk more about your use case and potential opportunities.

This section details some of the important things you should know.
