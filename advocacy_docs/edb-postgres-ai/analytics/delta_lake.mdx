description: Understand how Apache Iceberg powers modern data lakehouses and how Analytics Accelerator integrates Iceberg into the EDB Postgres ecosystem.
---

Apache Iceberg is an open table format that brings database capabilities to data lakes, including ACID transactions, schema evolution, and scalable query performance.

EDB leverages Iceberg as a foundational component of the Analytics Accelerator to power Postgres-based analytics on object storage at scale.

For details on how Iceberg is used and managed within Hybrid Manager (HM), see [Working with Apache Iceberg in Hybrid Manager](../hybrid-manager/analytics/iceberg).

## What is Apache Iceberg

Apache Iceberg modernizes data lakes by providing:

- Open table format with rich metadata and versioning
- ACID guarantees across large-scale datasets in object storage
- Support for schema evolution and partition evolution
- High-performance querying with column pruning and predicate pushdown
- Interoperability across Postgres, Spark, Trino, Presto, Flink, and more
- Separation of storage and compute

## Why Iceberg matters for EDB analytics

Iceberg is a core component of the Analytics Accelerator because it enables:

- Cost-effective tiered storage with Iceberg as the cold data tier for PGD
- Lakehouse query performance at scale via Postgres Lakehouse nodes
- Versioned, governed data accessible to Postgres and other data engines
- Simplified interoperability across the modern data ecosystem

## How EDB leverages Apache Iceberg

The Analytics Accelerator integrates Iceberg through multiple components:

- PGD offloading uses Iceberg as the target format for tiered tables
- PGAA extension enables querying Iceberg tables from Postgres Lakehouse nodes
- PGFS provides storage abstraction for object storage access
- EDB provides both:
- Catalog-based Iceberg support (via REST-compatible catalogs such as Lakekeeper, Glue, Nessie, Polaris)
- Filesystem-based Iceberg access

Supported operations:

- Query existing Iceberg tables from Postgres Lakehouse
- Offload PGD tiered data to Iceberg format
- Manage Iceberg catalogs for interoperability and governance

## Common use cases

| Use case | Iceberg + Analytics Accelerator |
|----------|---------------------------------|
| Data tiering for Postgres | Offload cold PGD data as Iceberg tables |
| BI and reporting | Query Iceberg tables via Postgres Lakehouse with BI tools |
| Data science | Use Iceberg as a feature store or training data source |
| Data governance | Manage versioned, ACID-compliant data lake tables |
| Cross-platform interoperability | Query Iceberg data across Spark, Trino, and Postgres |
