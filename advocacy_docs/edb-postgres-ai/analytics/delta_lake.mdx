description: Understand how Delta Lake enhances modern data lakes and how Analytics Accelerator leverages it within the EDB Postgres ecosystem.
---

Delta Lake is an open-source table format and transaction layer that enhances modern data lakes with ACID guarantees, schema enforcement, time travel, and scalable performance.

EDB enables first-class support for querying Delta Lake tables as part of the Analytics Accelerator — allowing Postgres SQL to operate on large-scale lakehouse data.

For details on how Delta Lake is used and managed within Hybrid Manager (HM), see [Working with Delta Lake in Hybrid Manager](../hybrid-manager/analytics/delta_lake).

## What is Delta Lake

Delta Lake adds database-like reliability and consistency to object storage systems such as S3, GCS, and Azure Data Lake Storage.

Key characteristics:

- ACID transactions with strong data consistency
- Schema enforcement and schema evolution support
- Time travel for querying historical versions of data
- Batch and streaming support
- Open format built on [Apache Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) with a transaction log (`_delta_log`)

## Why Delta Lake matters for EDB analytics

Delta Lake support enables the Analytics Accelerator to:

- Query existing Delta Lake tables in place using Postgres SQL
- Support interoperable data architectures across Postgres, Spark, Trino, Presto, and more
- Eliminate unnecessary data duplication or movement between systems
- Provide governed, versioned data for analytical queries within Lakehouse clusters

## How EDB leverages Delta Lake

EDB Postgres Lakehouse clusters provide access to Delta Lake data through the PGAA extension:

- Define Delta Lake external tables using `CREATE TABLE ... USING PGAA WITH (pgaa.format = 'delta', ...)`
- Efficiently query Parquet-backed Delta Lake tables via vectorized execution with [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/)
- Benefit from Delta Lake features including schema evolution and time travel

Current primary support: querying existing Delta Lake tables.
PGD offload currently targets Iceberg; Delta read support enables integration with existing Delta-based data lakes.
