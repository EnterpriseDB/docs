description: Learn how to query Delta Tables in external buckets.
---

It's possible to query data in external buckets, assuming it's formatted correctly as Delta Tables and meets a few requirements.

This is an early feature, and there is one major caveat: this must be a public bucket.

We're working on support for private buckets, and will be shipping it shortly. In fact, we actually support it now, but it requires some manual action on our side, and your side, for managing IAM policies. We want to get this right without managing credentials.

## Requirements

These are the requirements

* Must be an S3 bucket
* Must be _publicly accessible_
* Must be formatted as Delta Tables in `schema/table` format, where `schema` and `table` are valid Postgres identifiers

## Loading Data

You can use `lakehouse-sdl` to load data into a storage location...

## Pointing to a Bucket

You can call `seafowl.set_bucket_location(...)`

## Resetting Bucket Location

You can call `seafowl.set_bucket_location(null)`
