description: Understand how Tiered Tables enable cost-efficient analytics and data management with EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) and the Analytics Accelerator.
---

Tiered Tables enable EDB PostgresÂ® to manage large, time-based datasets efficiently by automatically moving "cold" data to cost-effective object storage, while keeping "hot" data in primary transactional storage.

This pattern optimizes both performance and cost while preserving full analytical access to the entire dataset.

For details on how Tiered Tables are implemented and managed within Hybrid Manager (HM), see [Implementing Tiered Tables in Hybrid Manager](../hybrid-manager/analytics/tiered_tables).

## What are Tiered Tables

Tiered Tables are a native capability of EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD), supported by the Analytics Accelerator architecture.

They automatically offload older partitions of time-partitioned tables from PGD to object storage (Apache Iceberg format) using:

- PGD AutoPartition for automated partitioning and lifecycle control
- PGAA and PGFS for querying and accessing offloaded data
- Optional Iceberg catalogs for governance and interoperability

The result: seamless, transparent access to data across hot (PGD) and cold (object storage) tiers.

## Why Tiered Tables matter for EDB analytics

Tiered Tables help organizations:

- Keep PGD operational storage lean and performant
- Lower storage costs by offloading old data to object storage
- Maintain unified query access to the full dataset
- Support both OLTP and OLAP use cases on Postgres
- Implement lakehouse architectures for historical analysis

## How EDB implements Tiered Tables

Core components:

- PGD AutoPartition:
- Creates new time-based partitions automatically
- Defines `analytics_offload_period` to control offload timing
- PGFS:
- Provides access to object storage for offloaded data
- PGAA:
- Enables unified querying across PGD and Iceberg tiers
- Creates an offloaded view (`table_offloaded`) for cold data only
- Optional Iceberg catalog:
- Supports governance and cross-platform interoperability

Query behavior:

- Queries on the parent PGD table automatically access both hot and cold data.
- The PGD query planner pushes WHERE clauses to optimize access across storage tiers.

## Common use cases

| Use case | Tiered Tables + Analytics Accelerator |
|----------|---------------------------------------|
| IoT and telemetry | Manage large time-series datasets with automated offload |
| Regulatory and financial data retention | Cost-efficient storage of historical data with full auditability |
| Analytical reporting on historical data | Use Lakehouse nodes to query offloaded data at scale |
| Hybrid OLTP / OLAP patterns | Keep current data fast on PGD, analyze large history in Iceberg |
