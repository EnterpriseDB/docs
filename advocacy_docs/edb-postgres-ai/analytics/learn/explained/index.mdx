## AI/ML workloads and interoperability

The Analytics Accelerator supports general-purpose analytics and can also serve as a platform component in AI/ML pipelines. For example:

- Lakehouse nodes can provide efficient access to large datasets used in model training.
- Tiered data patterns and ELT pipelines can stage data for AI/ML processing.

For AI/ML-specific concepts and guidance, refer to the [AI Factory concepts](../../ai-factory/learn/explained/concepts).
