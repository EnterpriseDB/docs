# Analytics Accelerator concepts

Use this page to understand how EDB delivers modern analytics capabilities with the Analytics Accelerator and Hybrid Manager (HM). This page explains how EDB implements key industry concepts through its analytics offerings.

For general industry concepts, visit the [generic concepts](./explained/generic-concepts).

## EDB’s vision for analytics on Postgres

EDB implements modern analytics patterns through the Analytics Accelerator. The core vision includes:

- Using Postgres as a unified platform for both operational and analytical workloads
- Performing analytics close to operational data to reduce data movement
- Leveraging open formats, vectorized engines, and distributed architectures
- Optimizing costs through data tiering and separation of storage and compute
- Managing all components through Hybrid Manager (HM)

## Key EDB solutions and technologies

### EDB Postgres Lakehouse

EDB implements the lakehouse architecture through EDB Postgres Lakehouse:

- Lakehouse nodes query data in object storage using open table formats
- Vectorized query execution powered by [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/)
- Columnar storage formats such as Parquet
- Support for [Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) today, with future extensibility planned
- Decoupled storage and compute architecture

[Separation of storage and compute](./explained/generic-concepts#separation-of-storage-and-compute)
[Open table formats](./explained/generic-concepts#open-table-formats)

### Vectorized query optimization

Analytics Accelerator uses vectorized query optimization by embedding [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/) into Lakehouse nodes:

- Queries are processed as columnar batches
- SIMD instructions accelerate execution
- Well suited to Parquet-formatted data

### EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) and tiered tables

EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) enables data tiering and offloading:

- PGD AutoPartition supports tiered tables
- Cold data is offloaded to object storage as Lakehouse tables
- Hot data remains in transactional PGD nodes

Tiered tables optimize both storage cost and analytical performance.

[ETL / ELT](./explained/generic-concepts#etl-elt)

### Advanced query optimization

Analytics Accelerator enhances core Postgres with optimizations such as:

- Improved parallel query processing
- Enhanced join algorithms for analytical workloads
- Tight integration with vectorized query execution for analytical patterns

## Analytics and AI/ML workloads

The Analytics Accelerator is designed to support general-purpose analytics workloads and can also serve as a platform component for AI/ML data pipelines. For example:

- Lakehouse nodes can provide efficient access to large datasets used in model training.
- Data tiering and ELT patterns can stage data used in AI/ML workflows.

For more in-depth coverage of concepts specific to AI/ML and vector-based workloads, see [AI Factory concepts](../../ai-factory/learn/explained/concepts).

## How EDB implements analytics across products

### Hybrid Manager (HM)

Hybrid Manager provides the control plane for managing Analytics Accelerator components:

- Provision and manage Lakehouse clusters
- Configure and monitor tiered tables
- Manage storage locations and compute nodes

### EDB Postgres Advanced Server / Extended Server

EDB Postgres Advanced Server is continuously enhanced for analytics:

- Supports parallel query execution improvements
- Adds advanced data types and query capabilities useful in analytics contexts

### EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD)

PGD serves as the foundation for:

- High availability transactional workloads
- Data tiering and offloading patterns
- Scalable architectures that integrate with Lakehouse nodes
