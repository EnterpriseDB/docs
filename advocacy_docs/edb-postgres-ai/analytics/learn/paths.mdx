# Analytics Accelerator learning paths

Use these learning paths to build knowledge progressively, from foundational concepts to advanced implementations and optimization techniques.

## How to use these learning paths

Select the level that matches your current knowledge and goals. Each level links to curated guides with conceptual explanations, how-to articles, and practical tutorials. For advanced topics and certification, explore official EDB training programs.

## Learning path levels

### Level 101: Foundations of the Analytics Accelerator

**Target audience:** Users new to the Analytics Accelerator, those new to modern data analytics concepts, or users seeking a refresher.

**Focus:** Core ideas, key terminology, the Analytics Accelerator landscape, and reasons behind analytical approaches.

What you will learn:

- Fundamental concepts of data warehouses, data lakes, and the lakehouse paradigm
- Key terms such as columnar storage, vectorized query engines, and open table formats (Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake)
- Overview of the Analytics Accelerator vision with Postgres® and core solutions such as EDB Postgres Lakehouse
- Benefits of separating storage and compute for analytics
