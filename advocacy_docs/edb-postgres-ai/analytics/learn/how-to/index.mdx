# Analytics Accelerator how-to guides

Use this section to find step-by-step instructions for performing common tasks with the Analytics Accelerator.

These how-to guides focus on core EDB technologies and direct interactions, often via SQL.

For broader, learning-oriented walkthroughs, see the [Tutorials](../tutorials).
For Hybrid Manager (HM)-specific workflows, refer to [HM analytics how-to guides](../../hm_analytics_spoke_root_v2).

## Interacting with data in object storage (EDB Postgres Lakehouse)

### SQL only

- [Define a PGFS storage location and create a PGAA external table](./define-storage-location)
- [Configure an Iceberg REST catalog connection](./configure-iceberg-catalog)

### Hybrid Manager

See [HM analytics how-to guides](../../hm_analytics_spoke_root_v2).

## Managing data with EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD)

### SQL only

- [Enable analytics offload for a PGD table](./enable-analytics-offload)
- [Configure BDR AutoPartition for a time-series table](./configure-bdr-autopartition)
- [Convert an offloaded PGD table to access analytical storage directly (PGAA)](./convert-offloaded-pgd-table)

### Hybrid Manager

See [HM analytics how-to guides](../../hm_analytics_spoke_root_v2).

This index will grow as additional tasks and features are documented.

While these guides focus on core EDB technology commands and concepts, implementation within Hybrid Manager includes additional UI workflows and management considerations â€” see the [HM analytics how-to guides](../../hm_analytics_spoke_root_v2).
