This guide will teach you how to sync data from a transactional database to Lakehouse Tables in a Managed Storage Location.

## Assumptions and Goal

We have some tables in a transactional database, and we want to sync them to Lakehouse Tables in a Managed Storage Location.

Caveats, source database:

* Must be a Postgres cluster in EDB Postgres AI Cloud Database
* Must be a managed Postgres AI Cloud Database
* Must be in AWS
* Must be in an EDB Hosted AWS region (not "Bring Your Own Account")

Caveats, managed storage location:

* Must be in the same project
* Must be in the same EDB Hosted AWS region
* Must be a _Managed_ Storage location - support for "bring your own bucket" destinations is coming soon...
* You cannot delete data in the Managed Storage Location

Limitations:

* One time sync
* Updating data requires performing another Sync to Lakehouse

## Setup

Create a transactional database... single node okay for this demo...

## Create the migration

1. Go to the cluster
2. Create the migration
3. Wait for it to complete

## Start a Lakehouse Node

1. Start Lakehouse Node
2. Query tables as defined in the migration

## Start another Lakehouse Node

Any Lakehouse Node in the project can query any Lakehouse Tables in the project.
