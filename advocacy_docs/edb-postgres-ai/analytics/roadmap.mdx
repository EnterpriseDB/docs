description: Where are we going with all this?

This is an early product, and we want you to get excited about the performance and possibilities. However, there's still a lot of work to do, especially as it relates to laoding data...

Here are some of the things we're planning to support:

* Continuous replication
* On-premises deployment
* Private buckets
* "Bring Your Own Bucket" (not just set in each node)
* Catalogs
