description: How to suspend or delete regions for EDB hosted cloud account
---

!!! Note
   If you're using EDB Hosted Cloud Service, you don't need to activate regions. However, you can suspend and delete regions.

## Suspend, reactivate, or delete a region

Before you suspend or delete a region, you must delete all clusters in that region.

1. On the left panel, select **Regions**.

   A list of previously activated regions appears. 
     
1. Select the icons next to a region to: 
   - Suspend or delete an active region. 
   - Reactivate a suspended region.

## Region status reference

| Status | Description                                                                                                                                            |

| Activating       | You have activated the region, and Cloud Service is setting up the compute and networking resources to support the cluster you requested. Backups and logs aren't available yet.                                                                         | 
| Active       | Cloud Service has completed setting up the compute and networking resources. The region has at least one cluster, and you can create more. The region has backups and logs.                                                                  |
| Suspended    | You have deleted any active clusters. Cloud Service has removed the compute and networking resources. The backups and logs are still available. Cloud Service continues to maintain backups and logs based on the retention period set when the cluster was last active.  |
| Deleted      | You have deleted the clusters. Cloud Service has removed the compute and networking resources. The backups and logs are no longer available. Only account owners can delete a region.                                            |
| Error        | An error occurred while trying to activate or suspend the region. The cause might be a quota issue. See the topic for your cloud provider under [Checking your cloud readiness](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/preparing_cloud_account/) for information on checking whether requirements and resource limits are met and how to raise them, if needed. Contact [EDB Support](/biganimal/release/overview/support) if you need additional help troubleshooting the error.  |
