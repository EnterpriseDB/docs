title: Modify a faraway replica
---

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal portal](https://portal.biganimal.com/).

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the cluster with the replica you want to modify. In the **Overview** tab, you can see the cluster's replicas under **Faraway Replicas**.

1. Select the **Edit Cluster** icon next to the replica you want to modify. The Edit Faraway Replica page appears. 

1. In the **Cluster Settings** tab, in the **Cluster Name** field, enter the name for your replica.

1. In the **Password** field, enter a password for your replica. 
 
   In the **Database Type** section, you can see the Postgres type and Postgres version inherited from the source cluster. You can't edit the Postgres type and Postgres version. 

1. Skip the **Region** section. The region is inherited from the source cluster and you can't modify it. 

1. Select the instance type in the **Instance Type** section. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on instance type settings.

   !!! Note
       To avoid lag during replication, ensure that your replica instance type is at least as large as the source cluster's instance type.

1. Select the storage settings in the **Storage** section. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on the storage settings.

   !!! Note
       To avoid lag during replication, ensure that your replica storage type is at least as large as the source cluster's storage type.
 
1. In the **Networking** section, you specify whether to use private or public networking. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on the **Networking** settings.

1. On the **DB Configuration** tab, to avoid replication issues when running a replica (standby server), set the following database configuration parameters to the same or higher value than on the source cluster (primary server). Otherwise, queries aren't allowed in the replica. If you plan to increase these GUC values, we highly recommend that you set the same value for all faraway replicas first and then set the value on the source cluster. Conversely, if you plan to decrease these GUC values, we recommend setting the source cluster's value first and then the value for all faraway replicas.
