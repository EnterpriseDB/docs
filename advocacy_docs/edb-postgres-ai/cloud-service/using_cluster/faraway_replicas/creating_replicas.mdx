## Create a faraway replica

You can create faraway replicas in any active regions in your cloud. There's no limit on the number of faraway replicas each cluster can have. However, the added resources and data transfers can increase your cloud costs.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the **Create Replica** icon next to a cluster to create its faraway replica. The Create Faraway Replica page appears.   

1. You can't edit the **Cloud Provider** field. The cloud provider is inherited from the source cluster. Move to the **Cluster Settings** tab.

1. On the **Cluster Settings** tab, enter a name for your replica in the **Cluster Name** field.

1. Skip to the **Region** section and select an active region where you want to deploy your replica. You can also choose to deploy your replica in the same region as the source cluster. The password and database type values are inherited from the source cluster.
 
1.  Select the instance type in the **Instance Type** section. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on instance type settings.

1.  Select the storage settings in the **Storage** section. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on the storage settings.
 
1.  In the **Networking** section, specify whether to use private or public networking. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on the **Networking** settings.

1. On the **DB Configuration** tab, to avoid replication issues when running a replica (standby server), keep the inherited value or increase it for the following database configuration parameters: 
   - `max_connections`

   - `max_locks_per_transaction`
   - `max_prepared_transactions`
   - `max_wal_senders`
   - `max_worker_processes`

1. On the **Additional Settings** tab, 

   Under the **Backups** section, change the default replica backup retention period of 30 days using the **Retention Time** controls. You can configure the retention period as follows:
   - 1&ndash;180 days
   - 1&ndash;25 weeks
   - 1&ndash;6 months

   Enable the **Custom Maintenance Window** option and use the controls to set a weekly 60-minute maintenance window in which maintenance upgrades occur for the cluster. If you don't set a window, the updates are applied at EDB's discretion with prior notification.  

   !!! Note
   Typically, maintenance updates take only a few minutes to complete.
   !!!

   For more information, see [Periodic maintenance](/biganimal/release/overview/updates).

   Under the **Extensions** section, 
   - enable the **pgvector** extension to add support for vector storage and vector similarity search to Postgres.
   - enable the **PostGIS** extension to add support for storing, indexing and querying geographic data.

   Under the **Security** section, the **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)** option is enabled by default only when your primary cluster is TDE-enabled. It automatically enables TDE and allows you to select the encryption key from the available List.

   !!!Note
   The TDE key material for faraway replicas must be the same as the primary cluster encryption key. If you use different key material, the cluster provisioning will fail.
 
   EDB does not support enabling TDE when restoring non-TDE faraway replica clusters.
   !!!

1. To turn on the ability to log in to Postgres using your AWS IAM credentials, enable Identity and Access Management (IAM) Authentication. See [Access](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#access).

1. Select **Create Replica**. 












## Using the CLI to manage faraway replicas

See [Faraway replicas CLI commands](/biganimal/latest/reference/cli/using_features/#faraway-replicas-cli-commands) for information on CLI commands for managing faraway replicas.
