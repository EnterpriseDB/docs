title: Promote a faraway replica
---

You can promote a faraway replica to a full-fledged cluster, which makes it capable of accepting writes. The new cluster created is different from the source cluster, and it doesn't replace the source cluster.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the cluster with the replica you want to promote. In the **Overview** tab, you can see the cluster's replicas under **Faraway Replicas**.

1. Select the **Promote Faraway Replica** icon next to the replica you want to promote. The Promote Faraway Replica page appears. 

1. The cluster settings are populated with values inherited from the source cluster. You can edit the cluster settings while creating your cluster. 

   !!! NoteNotes
       - You can promote a faraway replica to a single node or high-availability cluster but not to a distributed high-availability cluster. 
       - While promoting a replica to a cluster, you can't modify the **Provider** and **Region** fields and the **Database Type** section or enable read-only workloads.

1. Select **Promote Replica**.
