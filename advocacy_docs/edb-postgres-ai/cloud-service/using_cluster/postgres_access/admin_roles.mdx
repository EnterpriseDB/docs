## pg_ba_admin

So that we can effectively manage the cloud resources and ensure users are protected against security threats, Cloud Service provides a special administrative role, pg_ba_admin. The edb_admin user is a member of the pg_ba_admin role. The pg_ba_admin role has privileges similar to a Postgres superuser. Like the edb_admin user, the pg_ba_admin role shouldn't be used for day-to-day application operations and access to the role must be controlled carefully. See [pg_ba_admin role](pg_ba_admin) for details.

## superuser

Superuser access in Cloud Service is available only where the users are in control of their infrastructure. When using your own cloud account, you can grant the edb_admin role superuser privileges for a cluster. See [Superuser access](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/creating_cluster/creating_a_cluster/#superuser-access). 

When granting superuser privileges, to avoid degrading service or compromising availability, ensure you limit the number of connections used by superusers. Cloud Service reserves and requires a few superuser connections for the readiness probe for these reasons:

-   To check if the database is up and able to accept connections
-   For creating specific roles required in PostgreSQL instances and some extensions 

!!! note

    Superuser privileges allow you to make Postgres configuration changes using `ALTER SYSTEM` queries. We recommend that you don't do this because it might lead to an unpredictable or unrecoverable state of the cluster. In addition, `ALTER SYSTEM` changes aren't replicated across the cluster. 

For EDB Hosted Cloud Service and distributed high-availability clusters, there's no superuser access option. Use the edb_admin role for most superuser level activities. Unsafe activities aren't available to the edb_admin role.

Distributed high-availability clusters also have a bdr_superuser role. This isn't a general superuser but a specific user/role that has privileges and access to all the bdr schemas and functions. For more information, see [bdr_superuser](/pgd/latest/security/roles/).

See the [PostgreSQL documentation on superusers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/role-attributes.html) for best practices. 

## Notes on the edb_admin role

-   Changes to system configuration (GUCs) made by edb_admin or other Postgres users don't persist through a reboot or maintenance. Use the Console to modify system configuration.

-   You have to remember your edb_admin password, as EDB doesn't have access to it. If you forget it, you can set a new one in the Console on the Edit Cluster page.

-   Don't use the edb_admin user or the edb_admin database in your applications. Instead, use `CREATE USER; GRANT; CREATE DATABASE.`

-   Cloud Service stores all database-level authentication securely and directly in PostgreSQL. The `edb_admin` user password is `SCRAM-SHA-256` hashed prior to storage. This hash, even if compromised, can't be replayed by an attacker to gain access to the system.
