You can test the fault tolerance of your cluster by deleting a VM to inject a fault. Once a VM is deleted, you can monitor 
the availability and recovery of the cluster.

## Requirements

Before using fault injection testing, ensure you meet the following requirements:

+ You've connected your BigAnimal cloud account with your Azure subscription. See [Setting up your Azure Marketplace account](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/02_azure_market_setup/) for more information.
+ You have permissions in your Azure subscription to view and delete VMs and also the ability to view Kubernetes pods via Azure Kubernetes Service RBAC Reader.
+ You have PGD CLI installed.  See [Installing PGD CLI](/pgd/latest/cli/installing_cli/#) for more information. 
+ You've created a `pgd-cli-config.yml` file in your home directory.  See [Configuring PGD CLI](/pgd/latest/cli/configuring_cli/) for more information.

## Fault injection testing steps

Fault injection testing consists of the following steps:

1. Verifying cluster health
2. Determining the write leader node for your cluster
3. Deleting a write leader node from your cluster
4. Monitoring cluster health

### Verifying cluster health

Use the following commands to monitor your cluster health, node info, raft, replication lag, and write leads: 

```shell
pgd check-health -f pgd-cli-config.yml
pgd verify-cluster -f pgd-cli-config.yml
pgd show-nodes -f pgd-cli-config.yml
pgd show-raft  -f pgd-cli-config.yml
pgd show-replslots –verbose -f pgd-cli-config.yml
pgd show-subscriptions -f pgd-cli-config.yml
pgd show-groups -f pgd-cli-config.yml
```

You can use `pgd help` for more information on these commands.

To list the supported commands, enter:

```shell
pgd help
```

For help with a specific command and its parameters, enter `pgd help <command_name>`. For example:

```shell
pgd help show-nodes
```


### Determining the write leader node for your cluster

This example shows the command for determining the write leader node for a cluster:

```shell
pgd show-groups -f pgd-cli-config.yml
__OUTPUT__
Group               Group ID         Type     Write Leader     
--------        ------------------   —---     ------------     
world           3239291720  global           p-x67kjp3fsq-d-1 
p-x67kjp3fsq-a  2456382099  data     world   p-x67kjp3fsq-a-1 
p-x67kjp3fsq-c  4147262499  data     world                    
p-x67kjp3fsq-d  3176957154  data     world   p-x67kjp3fsq-d-1
```
In this example, the write leader node is `p-x67kjp3fsq-a-1`.


## Deleting a write leader node from your cluster

To delete a write lead node from the cluster:
1. Log into BigAnimal.
2. In a separate browser window, log into your Microsoft Azure subscription.
3. In the left navigation of BigAnimal portal, select **Clusters**. 
4. Select the cluster to test fault injection with and copy the string value from the URL. The string value is located after the underscore.

5. To search for the data plane, in your Azure subscription, paste the string into the search and prefix it with `dp-`.  

6. From the results, select the Kubernetes service from the Azure region that your cluster is deployed in.

7. Identify the Kubernetes service for your cluster.

!!!Note
Don't delete the Azure Kubernetes VMSS here or sub resources directly.
!!!

7. To delete a chosen node, browse to the data plane, select **Workloads**, and locate the Kubernetes resources for your cluster.

### Monitoring cluster health

After deleting a cluster node, you can monitor the health of the cluster using the same PGD CLI commands that you used to verify cluster health.
