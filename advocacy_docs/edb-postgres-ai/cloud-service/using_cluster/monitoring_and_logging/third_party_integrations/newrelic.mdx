The New Relic integration is based on the OpenTelemetry Collector, shipping the metrics over the standard OLTP protocol to the New Relic cloud endpoint.

!!!note
New Relic integration doesn't install the New Relic agent. It sends telemetry to the New Relic API.

## Prerequisites

You need a New Relic account before you can use this integration.

## Enable New Relic

To enable the **New Relic** integration: 

1. From the **Projects** page, select an existing project.
2. Go to **Settings** on the left-side navigation.
3. From the **Settings** list, select **Integrations** .
4. Select **New Relic**. In the window, provide the details: 
   - **New Relic API Key** &mdash; For details, see [New Relic API Key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/). The API key is sensitive information. You can't retrieve it after you save it.
   - **New Relic API Key Name** &mdash; Assign a name for the API key. You can use the API Key ID name to check the configuration details.
   - **New Relic Account ID** &mdash; Provide the New Relic account ID.
   
5. Select **Save**.

Enabling this integration sends Cloud Service telemetry to your New Relic account.

!!! note "Important"
Generate a new API license key in New Relic to enable this integration in Cloud Service. This API key must be specific to this integration. Don't share the key. Whenever you disable this integration, revoke the API key using the New Relic interface. Revoking the key disables the New Relic ingestion and billable usage from the Cloud Service integration. Revoking the key doesn't impact the other services that use the New Relic API.

## Metrics

Cloud Service sends a subset of the OpenTelemetry Collector's metrics from the hostmetrics and kubeletstats receivers. It also sends Cloud Service custom metrics for the monitored Postgres instance.

You can see a list of metrics in the New Relic interface along with dimensions for each metric. 

To see a list of metrics, select **Metrics & Events**. Then select a metric to see the dimensions sent for that metric. 

The set of metrics delivered to New Relic is subject to change. Metrics with names that begin with `postgres.preview.` or `biganimal.preview.` might be renamed or removed in a future release. Other metrics might also be renamed, added, or removed to better integrate into the New Relic platform.

## Cost

After enabling the Cloud Service telemetry integration, check your billable New Relic usage and continue to monitor it over time.

Be aware of the following important cost considerations:

* *You are responsible for all costs* charged to your New Relic account by telemetry sent by the Cloud Service New Relic integration. Charges are based on usage, but they can also result from Cloud Service errors or oversights. Enable the New Relic integration only if you accept this responsibility.

* New Relic bills usage by bytes ingested and for data retention. You must monitor and configure alerts on your New Relic data ingestion to reduce the risk of unexpectedly large usage bills. Also check your retention settings. 

New Relic has features to limit usage and ingestion. Review your limits before enabling the Cloud Service integration. In New Relic, select **Administration > Data management > Limits**. Also see the following related topics in the New Relic documentation:

* [Understand and manage data ingest](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/manage-data/manage-data-coming-new-relic/)
* [Data ingest: Billing and rules](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/accounts/accounts-billing/new-relic-one-pricing-billing/data-ingest-billing/)
* [Understand New Relic data limits](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/manage-data/view-system-limits/)
* [Get more detail about your data limits](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/data-apis/manage-data/query-limits/)

To disable the New Relic integration for Cloud Service and ensure no further costs are incurred on your New Relic account, you must revoke the API key provided to Cloud Service. Disabling the integration on the Console doesn't prevent costs from being incurred.
