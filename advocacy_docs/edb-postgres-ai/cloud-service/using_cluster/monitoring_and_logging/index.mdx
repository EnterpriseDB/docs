With Cloud Service, you have a few options for monitoring and logging solutions:

- If you're using your own cloud, the default observability solution is viewing metrics and logs from your cloud service provider. For more information about viewing metrics and logs from your cloud provider, see:

  - [Viewing metrics and logs from Azure](monitoring_from_azure)

  - [Viewing metrics and logs from AWS](monitoring_from_aws)

  For details on the types and format of metrics available from Cloud Service in your cloud provider, see [Metrics details](metrics).

- Cloud Service provides a Prometheus-compatible endpoint you can use to connect to your own metrics infrastructure, such as your AWS Managed Grafana. It also provides the option to view logs from your cloud provider's blob storage solution. For more information, see [Other monitoring and logging solutions](other_monitoring). This ability is an optional solution when you're using your own cloud account but is the only option when using Cloud Service's account.

- Cloud Service provides Cloud Service Observability as another metric endpoint. It consolidates and exposes metrics in each data plane. It is an integrated monitoring and alerting solution in Cloud Service. It's designed to monitor performance of the Postgres clusters. See [Cloud Service Observability](monitoring_using_biganimal_observability) for more information.

- Existing Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) users who want to monitor Cloud Service clusters alongside self-managed Postgres clusters can use the remote monitoring capability of PEM. See [Remote monitoring](/pem/latest/monitoring_performance/pem_remote_monitoring/). 

  With remote monitoring, you have access to many PEM features, including the ability to profile the workloads on your Cloud Service clusters. See [Profiling workloads](/pem/latest/profiling_workloads) for more information.
