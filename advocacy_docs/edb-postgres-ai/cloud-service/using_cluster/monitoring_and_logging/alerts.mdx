title: "Setting real-time alerts in Azure"

---

Cloud Service provides a wide range of metrics for your clusters. For details, see [Metrics details](metrics/). You can use a Log Analytics query to trigger a real-time alerts based on these metrics. 

This example sets up an alert that's triggered when one of your cluster groups goes down. Assume that your cluster group has an ID = `p-gjlmcos8n7` and is on a subscription called `development`.

1.  In the Azure portal, search for and select **Alerts**. On the Alerts page, you can see the metrics that Cloud Service collects from your environment.

2.  Select **+ Create** and select **Alert rule** to create new alert rule.

3.  Select **+ Select scope**. Under **Select a resource**:

    1.  Select your Azure subscription (**development**) in the **Filter by subscription** field. 

    2.  Select **Log Analytics workspaces** in the **Filter by resource type** field.

    3.  Select the Azure region of your cluster in the **Filter by location** field. 

4.  Cloud Service creates a Log Analytics workspace for each region in your Azure subscription. Select the Log Analytics workspace for your region, and select **Done**. The right column shows the regions.

5.  In the **Condition** tab: 

    1.  To set when the alert rule is triggered, Select **Add condition**. 

    2.  To monitor the Log Analytics service, select **Custom log search**.

6.  To trigger an alert when the database cluster isn't detected, enter the following query:

    ```text
    DpMetrics_CL
    | where Message has "cnp_collector_up"
    | extend m = todynamic(Message)
    | where m.labels.role == "primary" and m.labels.postgresql == "p-gjlmcos8n7"
    ```

     The query programs the alert to check for the `cnp_collector_up` metric for the p-gjlmcos8n7 database cluster. 

7.  After running the query, select **Continue editing alert**.

8.  Design the alert logic based on the number of results. Under **Alert logic**:

    1.  Set **Operator** to **Equals to**. 
    2.  In the **Threshold value** field, enter **0**.

        The alert is triggered when the database cluster is unavailable and there are no metrics of `cnp_collector_up`. The alert can indicate a monitoring problem or a critical error.

9.  In the **Details** tab, create the alert rule name.

10. Select **Review + Create**.

11. Select **Create**.
