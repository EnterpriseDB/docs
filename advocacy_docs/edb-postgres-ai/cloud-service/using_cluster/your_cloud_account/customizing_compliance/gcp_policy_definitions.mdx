Google Cloud uses Assured Workloads and the Organization Policy Service to ensure compliance rules are respected. Assured Workloads monitoring scans your environment in real time and provides alerts whenever organization policy changes violate the defined compliance posture. The monitoring dashboard shows which policy is being violated and provides instructions for resolving the finding.

For more information, see:
- [Overview of Assured Workloads](https://cloud.google.com/assured-workloads/docs/overview)
- [Introduction to the Organization Policy Service](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/overview)

Cloud Service doesnâ€™t customize your Google Cloud compliance rules to prevent conflicts with external workloads.
