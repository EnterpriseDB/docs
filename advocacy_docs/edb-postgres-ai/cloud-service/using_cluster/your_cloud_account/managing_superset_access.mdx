!!!note

   If you're using EDB Hosted Cloud Service, you don't have access to Superset.

You control access to Superset data sources by using Superset roles and permissions. 

Superset has three roles mapped to Cloud Service roles:

-   Gamma
-   Alpha
-   Admin

Learn more about Superset roles, users, and permissions management in [Superset Security](https://superset.apache.org/docs/security). 

The Superset roles map to Cloud Service permissions.

| Superset role | Description                                                                                                            | Cloud Service permissions mapped to Superset role |

| Alpha         | All Superset Gamma privileges, plus the ability to add or modify data sources                                          | Project editor                                    |
| Admin         | All Superset Alpha privileges, plus access to SQL Lab and the ability to grant or revoke access to data to other users | Project owner                                     |

!!!Note Notes

   -   Access to Superset is currently limited to the initial default project set up by Cloud Service. The user needs to have a project role for the initial project to access Superset.
   -   While Admin users have access to all databases by default, both Alpha and Gamma users need to be given access by way of the Superset sql_lab role on a per-database basis. The sql_lab role grants access to SQL Lab. 

To assign Cloud Service user roles, see [Users](/edb-postgres-ai/console/using/organizations/users/#users).
