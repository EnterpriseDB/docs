AWS VPC endpoint (AWS Private Link) service is a network interface that securely connects a private IP address from your AWS VPC to an external service. You grant access only to a single cluster instead of the entire Cloud Service resource VPC, thus ensuring maximum network isolation. 

For more information, see [VPC endpoint services (AWS PrivateLink)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/endpoint-service.html).

The way you create a private endpoint differs when you're using your AWS account versus using EDB Hosted Cloud Service.

## Using EDB Hosted Cloud Service

When using EDB Hosted Cloud Service, you provide Cloud Service with your AWS account ID when creating a cluster (see [Networking](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#network-logs--telemetry-section)). Cloud Service, in turn, provides you with an AWS service name, which you can use to connect to your cluster privately.

1. When creating your cluster, on the **Cluster Settings** tab, in the **Network** section:
   1. Select **Private**.

   1. Enter your application's AWS account ID using just numbers (no hyphens), for example, 123456789012.

1. After the cluster is created, go to the cluster details to see the corresponding endpoint service name. You need the service name while creating a VPC endpoint.

1. Create a VPC endpoint in the client's VPC. The steps for creating a VPC endpoint in the client's VPC are the same whether you're using EDB Hosted Cloud Service or Your Cloud Account. The steps are available [here](#step-2-create-a-vpc-endpoint-in-the-clients-vpc).

1. In your application's AWS account, select **VPC**, and then select **Endpoints**. Select the endpoint you created previously, and use the service name provided in the details section in Cloud Service to access your cluster.

## Using your AWS account

Two different methods enable you to connect to your private cluster from your application's VPC in AWS. Each method offers different levels of accessibility and security. The VPC endpoint method is recommended and is most commonly used. However, you can also use the VPC peering connection method if required by your organization.

### AWS VPC endpoint (recommended)

AWS VPC endpoint (AWS Private Link) service is a network interface that securely connects a private IP address from your AWS VPC to an external service. You grant access only to a single cluster instead of the entire Cloud Service resource VPC, thus ensuring maximum network isolation. Other advantages include:

-   You need to configure the PrivateLink only once. Then you can use multiple VPC endpoints to connect applications from different VPCs.
-   There's no risk of IP address conflicts.

There's an associated cost of resources, however.

For more information, see [VPC endpoint services (AWS PrivateLink)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/endpoint-service.html).

#### Example
This example shows how to connect your cluster using VPC endpoints.

Assume that your cluster is on an account called `development` and is being accessed from a client on another account called `test`. It has the following properties:

-   EDB Postgres AI cluster:
    -   AWS account: `development`
    -   Amazon resource name (ARN): `arn:aws:iam::123456789123:root`
    -   Cluster ID: `p-mckwlbakq5` 
    -   Account ID: `brcxzr08qr7rbei1` 
    -   Organization's domain name: `biganimal.io`

-   Client:
    -   AWS account: `test`
    -   Resource group: `rg-client`
    -   VPC: `vpc-client`
    -   VPC subnet: `snet-client`

#### Prerequisites

To walk through an example in your own environment, you need:

- Your cluster URL. You can find the URL in the **Connect** tab of your cluster instance in the EDB Postgres AI Console.


#### Step 1: Create an endpoint service for your cluster

In the AWS account connected to EDB Postgres AI Console, create an endpoint service to provide access to your clusters from other VPCs in other AWS accounts. Perform this procedure for each cluster to which you want to provide access.

1. Open the [Amazon EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/). Ensure that the region where your cluster is deployed is selected in the upper-right corner of the console.

1. In the navigation pane, under **Load Balancing**, select **Load Balancers**.

1. Identify the load balancer that's tagged with the ID of the cluster to which you want to connect (`<cluster-id>-rw-internal-lb`), for example, `p-96fh28m3cb-rw-internal-lb`. Note the name of that network load balancer.

1. Open the [Amazon VPC console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/). 

1. From the navigation pane on the left, under **Virtual Private Cloud**, select **Endpoint Services**, and then select **Create endpoint service**.

1. Enter a suitable name for the endpoint service.

1. Select **Network** for the load balancer type.

1. Under **Available load balancers**, select the network load balancer of the cluster to which you want to connect. 
 
1. Leave all the other fields with their default values, and select **Create**. 

1. Under **Details**, note the **Service name** of the created endpoint service (for example, `com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0e123abc123198abc`). You need the service name while creating a VPC endpoint.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Endpoint Services**.

1. Select your endpoint service from the **Actions** list, and select **Allow principals**.
 
1. Add the AWS account with which you want to connect to the endpoint service by specifying the ARN for the principal. The ARN must be in this format:

 arn:aws:iam::&lt;AWS ACCOUNT ID&gt;:root


#### Step 2: Create a VPC endpoint in the client's VPC

Now that your endpoint service is created, you can connect it to the cluster VPC using a VPC endpoint. Perform this procedure in your application's AWS account. 

!!! Note
    In your application's AWS account, ensure that you allow your application's security group to connect to your cluster.

1. Open the [Amazon VPC console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/).

1. Ensure that the region where your cluster is deployed is selected in the upper-right corner of the console.

1. From the navigation pane on the left, under **Virtual Private Cloud**, select **Endpoints**, and then select **Create endpoint**.

1. Enter a suitable name for the endpoint service.

1. Under **Service category**, select **Other endpoint services**.

1. Under **Service Name**, enter the name of the endpoint service that you created earlier:
   
   -  If following the example using your AWS account: `com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0e123abc123198abc`
   -  If using EDB Hosted Cloud Service: the service name provided in your Cloud Service cluster's details 
   
   To verify whether you successfully allowed access to the endpoint, select **Verify service**.

1. Under VPC, select the client's VPC in which to create the endpoint. 

1. Under **Subnets**, select the subnets (availability zones) in which to create the endpoint network interfaces. Enable the endpoint in all availability zones used by your application.

1. Select **Create endpoint**.

#### Step 3: Accept and test the connection

1. In your AWS account connected to Cloud Service, select **VPCs**, and then select **Endpoint services**. 

1. Select the endpoint service instance you created previously, and accept the endpoint connection request under **Endpoint connections**. 

1. You can now successfully connect to your cluster.

 In your application's AWS account, select **VPC** and then select **Endpoints**. Select the endpoint you created previously and use the DNS name provided in the details section to access your cluster.
