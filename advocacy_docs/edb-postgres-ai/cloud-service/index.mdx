The EDB Postgres® AI Cloud Service is a holistic platform which includes hybrid data estate management, observability, analytics, and AI capabilities. 


## Overview

The EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service itself is a fully managed cloud service that provides a high-performance, scalable, and secure database platform for analytics and AI workloads. It also provides the platform for [EDB Postgres AI Analytics](../analytics/) and [EDB Postgres AIDB](../ai-ml/) services.

Cloud Service builds on the [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest) and [EDB Postgres Extended](/pge/latest) databases and it's designed to help organizations accelerate the development and deployment of AI and analytics applications.

Databases in the EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service can run on EDB's own cloud accounts or managed by EDB on your own cloud on your behalf. 

## EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service, Console, and Estate

You get full visibility of the databases from the [EDB Postgres AI Console](../console), which is a web-based interface that provides a single pane of glass for managing your databases, monitoring performance, and accessing logs and metrics.

The Console view isn't limited to managed or hosted database deployments. You can also deploy the databases yourself in your own cloud or on-premises, but still have them visible in your EDB Postgres AI Console as part of your [Estate](../console/estate) using the [Beacon Agent](/edb-postgres-ai/console/estate/agent/).
