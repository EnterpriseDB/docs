Cloud Service supports three cluster types: 
- [Single node](./single_node)
- [Primary/standby high availability](./primary_standby_highavailability)
- [Distributed high availability](./distributed_highavailability)

You choose the type of cluster you want on the [Create Cluster](https://portal.biganimal.com/create-cluster) page in the [Console](https://portal.biganimal.com).
