title: "Faraway replicas"
---

Faraway replicas are read-only replicas of Cloud Service clusters that you can provision in most supported regions. You can create faraway replicas of your single-node and high-availability clusters in different regions of your cloud. Database users and applications can read from a nearby faraway replica instead of the source cluster. This ability relieves some of the workload on the source cluster and frees it up to handle write traffic. 

In case of a failure, you can manually promote the faraway replica to a full-fledged Cloud Service cluster, making it capable of accepting writes. See [Managing replicas](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/using_cluster/faraway_replicas/).

In Cloud Service, faraway replicas use log shipping to replicate from their source clusters. This means that a replica cluster accesses the write-ahead log (WAL) of its source cluster and “replays” the changes described in it. 

A WAL is a file that logs any changes made to a database. Databases write the change to the WAL before actually making the change. This way, if the database goes down before the change can be applied, the WAL has a record of the intended changes. The replica pulls in the changes from the WAL every time a new WAL file is closed, so replication is asynchronous.

Faraway replicas are priced the same as single-node clusters.

## Advantages

-   **Disaster recovery** — You can create faraway replicas in different regions in your cloud. Deploying faraway replicas across regions can help you build a more solid disaster recovery (DR) plan.

-   **Improved read-query performance** — For an improved read-query performance, set up the faraway replica in the same region as your application. For example, applications can read the writes made to a cluster in the `us-east` region from a `us-west` replica.

-   **Flexibility** — Options you might not find anywhere else:
    -   Your choice of instance type and size
    -   Your choice of storage volume and properties
    -   No limit to the number of replicas you can create

## Limitations

-   **Manual intervention** — Unlike standby replicas, Cloud Service doesn't automatically promote faraway replicas to the source cluster in case of a failure.

-   **Replication lag** — Promoting a faraway replica to a Cloud Service cluster can result in loss of data. See [Replication lag  with faraway replicas](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/managing_your_cluster/backup_and_restore/#replication-lag-with-faraway-replicas).

## Examples

The diagram shows a three-node, high-availability cluster with two faraway replicas.
