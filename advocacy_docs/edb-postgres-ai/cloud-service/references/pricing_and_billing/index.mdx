The costs include database pricing for EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service and the associated costs from other providers. You can also view usage and metering information. 

Cloud Service calculates the estimated monthly price for your cluster and displays it at the bottom of the page while you're [creating a cluster](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/creating_cluster/creating_a_cluster/). This estimate includes database costs. If you're using Cloud Service's cloud account, it also includes infrastructure costs.

## Database pricing

Pricing is based on the number of virtual central processing units (vCPUs) provisioned for the database software offering. Consumption of vCPUs is metered hourly. 

### Single-node and primary/standby high-availability pricing

When primary/standby high-availability configurations are enabled, to calculate the full price for all resources used, multiply the number of vCPUs per instance by the number of replicas configured. 

This table shows the cost breakdown.

| Database type                | Hourly price   | Monthly price\* |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| PostgreSQL                   | $0.0856 / vCPU | $62.49 / vCPU   |
| EDB Postgres Extended Server | $0.1655 / vCPU | $120.82 / vCPU  |
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server | $0.2568 / vCPU | $187.46 / vCPU  |

\* The monthly cost is approximate and assumes 730 hours in a month. 

### Distributed high-availability pricing

When distributed high-availability configurations are enabled, to calculate the full price for all resources used, multiply the number of vCPUs per instance by the number of data nodes configured. You aren't charged for the database price for witness nodes or groups in distributed high-availability configurations, just the infrastructure resources, such as compute. Distributed high-availability clusters are powered by [EDB Postgres Distributed](/pgd/latest).

This table shows the cost breakdown.

| Database type                | Hourly price   | Monthly price\* |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| EDB Postgres Extended Server | $0.2511 / vCPU | $183.30 / vCPU  |
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server | $0.3424 / vCPU | $249.95 / vCPU  |

\* The monthly cost is approximate and assumes 730 hours in a month. 

## Cloud infrastructure costs

If you're connecting directly to Cloud Service through your Microsoft Azure AWS, or Google Cloud account, EDB doesn't bill you for cloud infrastructure, such as compute, storage, data transfer, monitoring, and logging.

Your cloud provider bills you directly for the cloud infrastructure provisioned according to the terms of your account agreement. 

-   Microsoft Azure provides invoice and usage information on the Microsoft Azure Portal billing page. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/).
-   AWS provides invoice information on the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/account-billing/index.html).
-   Google Cloud provides invoice information on your Cloud Billing account. [Learn more](https://cloud.google.com/billing/docs).

## Management costs

If you deploy a large number of clusters in a single region, for example, more than 30, EDB might deploy additional management infrastructure to support your workloads. In addition, EDB provisions a number of other free resources in your account to help with management. 

If you want to remove management resources provisioned from your cloud provider, contact [Support](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/support_services/).

## Apache Superset costs

Enabling [Apache Superset](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/using_cluster/your_cloud_account/analyze_with_superset/) to analyze your data has an added cost. In most cases the costs are approximately $150 per month, based on your cloud provider, instance and storage type selections, and other factors.

## PgBouncer costs

Enabling [PgBouncer](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/creating_cluster/creating_a_cluster/#pgbouncer) to pool your connections incurs additional costs that depend on your cloud provider. In addition to the cloud provider costs, PgBouncer connects to your primary server and requires an IP address. Cloud Service provisions up to three instances per PgBouncer-enabled cluster to ensure that performance is unaffected, so each availability zone receives its own instance of PgBouncer. The extra VM costs are the 2vcpu SKU times the number of PgBouncer instances. For AWS, the instance type is c5.large. For Azure, the instance type is F2s_v2.
