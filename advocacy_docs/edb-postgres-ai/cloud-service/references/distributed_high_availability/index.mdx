When running a distributed high-availability cluster on Cloud Service, you can use the [PGD CLI](/pgd/latest/cli/) to manage cluster operations. Examples of these operations include switching over write leaders, performing cluster health checks, and viewing various details about nodes, groups, or other aspects of the cluster.
