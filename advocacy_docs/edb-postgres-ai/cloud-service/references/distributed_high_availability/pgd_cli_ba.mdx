When running a distributed high-availability cluster on Cloud Service, you can use the [PGD CLI](/pgd/latest/cli/) to manage cluster operations. 
Examples of these operations include switching over write leaders, performing cluster health checks, and viewing various details about nodes, groups, or other aspects of the cluster.

## Installing the PGD CLI

To [install the PGD CLI](/pgd/latest/cli/installing/), for Debian and Ubuntu machines, replace `<your-token>` with your EDB subscription token in the following command:

```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/&lt;your-token&gt;/postgres_distributed/setup.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash
sudo apt-get install edb-pgd5-cli
```

For RHEL, Rocky, AlmaLinux, or Oracle Linux machines, make the replacement in this command:

```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/&lt;your-token&gt;/postgres_distributed/setup.rpm.sh' | sudo -E bash
sudo yum install edb-pgd5-cli
```

## Connecting to your Cloud Service cluster

### Discovering your database connection string

To connect to your distributed high-availability Cloud Service cluster using the PGD CLI, you need to [discover the database connection string](/pgd/latest/cli/discover_connections/). From your Console:

1.  Log in to the [Cloud Service clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) view.
2.  To show only clusters that work with PGD CLI, in the filter, set **Cluster Type** to **Distributed High Availability**.
3.  Select your cluster.
4.  In the view of your cluster, select the **Connect** tab.
5.  Copy the read/write URI from the connection info. This is your connection string.

### Using the PGD CLI with your database connection string

!!!Important

PGD doesn't prompt for interactive passwords. Accordingly, you need a [`.pgpass` file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html) properly configured to allow access to the cluster. Your Cloud Service cluster's connection information page has all the information needed for the file. 

Without a properly configured `.pgpass`, you receive a database connection error when using a PGD CLI command, even when using the correct database connection string with the `--dsn` flag.
!!!

To use the PGD CLI with your database connection string, use the `--dsn` flag with your PGD CLI command:

```bash
pgd nodes list --dsn "<your_connection_string>"
```

## PGD commands in Cloud Service

The examples that follow show the most common PGD CLI commands with a Cloud Service cluster.

### `pgd cluster show --health`

`pgd cluster show --health` provides statuses with relevant messaging regarding the clock skew of node pairs, node accessibility, the current raft leader, replication slot health, and versioning consistency:

```
pgd cluster show --health --dsn "postgres://edb_admin@p-mbx2p83u9n-a.pg.biganimal.io:5432/bdrdb?sslmode=require"
__OUTPUT__
Connections
-----------
Checks if all BDR nodes are accessible.

Result: Ok, all BDR nodes are accessible


Raft
----
Raft Consensus status. Checks if all data and witness nodes are participating
in raft and have the same leader.

Result: Ok, raft Consensus is working correctly


Replication Slots
-----------------
Checks if all PGD replication slots are working correctly.

Result: Ok, all PGD replication slots are working correctly


Clock Skew
----------
Clock drift between nodes. Uses raft leader as reference node to calculate
clock drift. High clock drift can affect conflict resolution and potentially
cause inconsistency.

Result: Ok, clock drift is within permissible limit


Versions
--------
Checks if all nodes are running the same PGD version.

Result: Ok, all nodes are running the same PGD version      
```

### `pgd nodes list`

`pgd nodes list` returns all the nodes in the distributed high-availability cluster and their summaries, including name, node id, group, and current/target state:

```
pgd nodes list--dsn "postgres://edb_admin@p-mbx2p83u9n-a.pg.biganimal.io:5432/bdrdb?sslmode=require"
__OUTPUT__
Node Name Group Name   Node Kind Join State Node Status
--------- ------------ --------- ---------- -----------
kaboom    dc1_subgroup data      ACTIVE     Up         
kaftan    dc1_subgroup data      ACTIVE     Up         
kaolin    dc1_subgroup data      ACTIVE     Up    
```

### `pgd show-groups`

`pgd groups show` returns all groups in your distributed high-availability Cloud Service cluster. 

```
pgd groups show --dsn "postgres://edb_admin@p-mbx2p83u9n-a.pg.biganimal.io:5432/bdrdb?sslmode=require"
__OUTPUT__
Group Name   Parent Group Name Group Type Nodes
------------ ----------------- ---------- -----
democluster                   global     0    
dc1_subgroup democluster      data       3   
```

### `pgd group set-leader`

`pgd group set-leader` manually changes the write leader of the group and can be used to simulate a [failover](/pgd/latest/quickstart/further_explore_failover).

```
pgd group world set-leader kaftan --dsn "postgres://edb_admin@p-mbx2p83u9n-a.pg.biganimal.io:5432/bdrdb?sslmode=require"
__OUTPUT__
Command executed successfully
```

See the [PGD CLI command reference](/pgd/latest/cli/command_ref/) for the full range of PGD CLI commands and their descriptions.
