When running a distributed high-availability cluster on Cloud Service, you can use the [PGD CLI](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/) to manage cluster operations.
Examples of these operations include switching over write leaders, performing cluster health checks, and viewing various details about nodes, groups, or other aspects of the cluster.

## Installing the PGD CLI

To [install the PGD CLI](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/installing/), for Debian and Ubuntu machines, replace `<your-token>` with your EDB subscription token in the following command:

```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/<your-token>/postgres_distributed/setup.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash
sudo apt-get install edb-pgd5-cli
```

For RHEL, Rocky, AlmaLinux, or Oracle Linux machines, make the replacement in this command:

```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/<your-token>/postgres_distributed/setup.rpm.sh' | sudo -E bash
sudo yum install edb-pgd5-cli
```

## Connecting to your Cloud Service cluster

### Discovering your database connection string

To connect to your distributed high-availability Cloud Service cluster using the PGD CLI, you need to [discover the database connection string](/pgd/latest/cli/discover_connections/). From your Console:

1. Log in to the [Cloud Service clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) view.
2. To show only clusters that work with PGD CLI, in the filter, set **Cluster Type** to **Distributed High Availability**.
3. Select your cluster.
4. In the view of your cluster, select the **Connect** tab.
5. Copy the read/write URI from the connection info. This is your connection string.

### Using the PGD CLI with your database connection string

!!!Important

PGD doesn't prompt for interactive passwords. Accordingly, you need a [`.pgpass` file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html) properly configured to allow access to the cluster. Your Cloud Service cluster's connection information page has all the information needed for the file. 

Without a properly configured `.pgpass`, you receive a database connection error when using a PGD CLI command, even when using the correct database connection string with the `--dsn` flag.
!!!

To use the PGD CLI with your database connection string, use the `--dsn` flag with your PGD CLI command:

```bash
pgd nodes list --dsn "<your_connection_string>"
```

## PGD commands in Cloud Service

The examples that follow show the most common PGD CLI commands with a Cloud Service cluster.

### `pgd cluster show --health`

`pgd cluster show --health` provides statuses with relevant messaging regarding the clock skew of node pairs, node accessibility, the current raft leader, replication slot health, and versioning consistency:

```
pgd cluster show --health --dsn "postgres://edb_admin@p-w75f4ib1pu-a.vmk31wilqpjeopka.biganimal.io:5432/bdrdb?sslmode=require"
__OUTPUT__
Check             Status Details
----------------- ------ -----------------------------------------------
Connections       Ok     All BDR nodes are accessible
Raft              Ok     Raft Consensus is working correctly
Replication Slots Ok     All PGD replication slots are working correctly
Clock Skew        Ok     Clock drift is within permissible limit
Versions          Ok     All nodes are running the same PGD version
```

### `pgd nodes list`

`pgd nodes list` returns all the nodes in the distributed high-availability cluster and their summaries, including name, node id, group, and current/target state:

```
pgd nodes list --dsn "postgres://edb_admin@p-w75f4ib1pu-a.vmk31wilqpjeopka.biganimal.io:5432/bdrdb?sslmode=require"
__OUTPUT__
Node Name        Group Name     Node Kind Join State Node Status
---------------- -------------- --------- ---------- -----------
p-w75f4ib1pu-a-1 p-w75f4ib1pu-a data      ACTIVE     Up
p-w75f4ib1pu-a-2 p-w75f4ib1pu-a data      ACTIVE     Up
p-w75f4ib1pu-a-3 p-w75f4ib1pu-a data      ACTIVE     Up
```

### `pgd groups show`

`pgd groups show` returns all groups in your distributed high-availability Cloud Service cluster. 

```
pgd groups show --dsn "postgres://edb_admin@p-w75f4ib1pu-a.vmk31wilqpjeopka.biganimal.io:5432/bdrdb?sslmode=require"
__OUTPUT__
Group Name     Parent Group Name Group Type Nodes
-------------- ----------------- ---------- -----
world                            global     0
p-w75f4ib1pu-a world             data       3
```

### `pgd group set-leader`

`pgd group set-leader` manually changes the write leader of the group and can be used to simulate a [failover](/pgd/latest/quickstart/further_explore_failover).

```
pgd group p-w75f4ib1pu-a set-leader p-w75f4ib1pu-a-2 --dsn "postgres://edb_admin@p-w75f4ib1pu-a.vmk31wilqpjeopka.biganimal.io:5432/bdrdb?sslmode=require"
__OUTPUT__
Command executed successfully
```

See the [PGD CLI command reference](/pgd/latest/cli/command_ref/) for the full range of PGD CLI commands and their descriptions.
