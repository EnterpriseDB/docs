description: "How Cloud Service supports the major Postgres versions."
---

We support the major Postgres versions from the date they're made available until the version is retired by EDB (generally five years). See [Platform Compatibility ](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#epas) for more details on support dates for PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Advanced Server, and EDB Postgres Extended Server. See [End-of-life policy](#end-of-life-policy) for details on our policy for retiring deprecated versions.

## Supported Postgres types and versions

|    Postgres distribution     |                      Versions                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PostgreSQL                   | 12-16 for (single, high-availability) clusters                                                |
| EDB Postgres Extended Server | 12-16 for (single, high-availability), 14-16 for (distributed high-availability) clusters     |
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server | 14-16 for all cluster types (single, high-availability, distributed high-availability)        |

## End-of-life policy

Cloud Service deprecates support for Postgres versions following the same timeline as PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Advanced Server, and EDB Postgres Extended Server follow the same timelines. We recommend that you take action and upgrade your Postgres databases running on the deprecated version to a later version as soon as possible. 

Six months before the PostgreSQL deprecation date, Cloud Service doesn't allow you to create new instances with the deprecated database version. 

Six months after the PostgreSQL deprecation date, Cloud Service forces a major version upgrade to all clusters running the deprecated database version.

The only exception is customers who purchased Extended Life Support (ELS) prior to that date. To purchase Extended Life Support, contact EDB Sales.

## Key dates 

While PostgreSQL officially deprecated version 11 on November 9, 2023, Cloud Service deprecated PostgreSQL 11 on November 20, 2023 in alignment with the broader EDB portfolio. 

On November 20, 2023, Cloud Service deprecated support for PostgreSQL 11 and EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11 using the following schedule. We recommend that you take action and upgrade your Postgres databases running on major version 11 to a later version, such as PostgreSQL version 15.

Cloud Service automatically upgrades your Postgres 11 instances to a later version at the end of six months. Customers who purchased Extended Life Support are exempt. To purchase Extended Life Support, contact Sales. Cloud Service reserves the right to upgrade sooner in case of a security issue.
