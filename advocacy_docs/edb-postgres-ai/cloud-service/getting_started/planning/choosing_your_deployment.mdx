You have two deployment options with EDB Postgres AI. You can deploy clusters using EDB Hosted Cloud Service, or you can deploy using Your Cloud Account.

To learn about the pricing of these two deployment options, see [Pricing and billing](/biganimal/latest/pricing_and_billing/).

## EDB Hosted Cloud Service

EDB Hosted Cloud Service offers a seamless deployment option and deploys your cluster instantly. 

To deploy clusters using EDB Hosted Cloud Service: 

- Choose what [Postgres distribution](/biganimal/latest/planning/choosing_postgres_distro) available on the Cloud Service best meets your needs.

- Select appropriate regions from the [EDB Hosted Cloud Service regions]() to place your cloud resources closest to your users. 

- Evaluate how EDB Postgres AI charges you for [cloud infrastructure costs](/biganimal/latest/pricing_and_billing/#biganimals-cloud-account).


~~!!! Note
Currently, when you deploy in EDB Hosted cloud service, you can use AWS or Google Cloud as your cloud provider. If you want to use your cloud account's Identity and Access Management (IAM) service for database authentication, you must deploy clusters in your own cloud account. If you deploy using EDB Hosted cloud service, the underlying cloud provider is hidden, so you can't manage IAM access.

## Your Cloud Account

When deploying in your cloud account, you need to set up your cloud service provider. You can use your AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud account. In this deployment model, you are responsible for managing your cloud resources and connecting your cloud to EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service. To set up your cloud service provider, see [Checking your cloud readiness](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/preparing_cloud_account/).
