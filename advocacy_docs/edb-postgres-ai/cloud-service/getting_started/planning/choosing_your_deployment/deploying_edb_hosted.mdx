To deploy clusters using BigAnimal's cloud account: 

- Choose what [Postgres distribution](/biganimal/latest/planning/choosing_postgres_distro) available on the BigAnimal cloud best meets your needs.
- Review the [supported regions](/biganimal/latest/overview/03a_region_support/#biganimals-cloud-account) in which you can create clusters for BigAnimal's cloud account, enabling you to locate your cloud resources close to your customers, both internal or external.
