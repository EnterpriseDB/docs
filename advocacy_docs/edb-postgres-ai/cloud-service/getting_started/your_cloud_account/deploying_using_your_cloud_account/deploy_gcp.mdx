To use Google Cloud as your cloud account:

- Sign in for the first time with your EDB account, and then either use the EDB Postgres AI Console as your identity provider or [set up your own provider](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/identity_provider/) afterward. 
- Check the [readiness of your Google Cloud account](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/preparing_cloud_account/preparing_gcp/) before deploying. 
- [Connect your Google Cloud account](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/02_connecting_to_your_cloud/connecting_gcp/) to EDB Postgres AI Console using Google Cloud Shell. 
- [Connect your cluster from Google Cloud](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/02_connecting_your_cluster/connecting_from_gcp/) to EDB Postgres AI Console using Google Cloud's Private Service Connect. 
- [Review the supported Google Cloud regions](/biganimal/latest/overview/03a_region_support/#google-cloud-regions) where you can create clusters for the Google Cloud account, enabling you to locate your cloud resources close to your customers.
