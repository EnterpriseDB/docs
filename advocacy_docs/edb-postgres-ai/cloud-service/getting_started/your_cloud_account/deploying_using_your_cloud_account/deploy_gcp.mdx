To use Google Cloud as your cloud account:

-   Sign in for the first time with your EDB account, and then either use the EDB Postgres AI Console as your identity provider or [set up your own provider](/edb-postgres-ai/console/using/organizations/identity_provider/) afterward. 
-   Check the [readiness of your Google Cloud account](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/your_cloud_account/preparing_cloud_account/preparing_gcp/) before deploying. 
-   [Connect your Google Cloud account](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/your_cloud_account/connecting_to_your_cloud/connecting_gcp/) to EDB Postgres AI Console using Google Cloud Shell. 
-   [Connect your cluster from Google Cloud](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/using_cluster/connecting_your_cluster/connecting_from_gcp/) to EDB Postgres AI Console using Google Cloud's Private Service Connect. 
-   [Review the supported Google Cloud regions](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/references/supported_regions/#google-cloud-regions) where you can create clusters for the Google Cloud account, enabling you to locate your cloud resources close to your customers.
