To use Azure as your cloud account:

-   Sign in for the first time with your EDB account, and then either use the EDB Postgres AI Console as your identity provider or [set up your own provider](/edb-postgres-ai/console/using/organizations/identity_provider/) afterward. 
-   [Connect your Azure Marketplace account](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/your_cloud_account/azure_market_setup/) to Cloud Service.  
-   Check the readiness of [your Azure subscription](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/your_cloud_account/preparing_cloud_account/preparing_azure/) before deploying.  
-   [Connect your Azure cloud](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/your_cloud_account/connecting_to_your_cloud/connecting_azure/) to Cloud Service. 
-   [Connect to Cloud Service](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/using_cluster/connecting_your_cluster/connecting_from_azure/) from your application's virtual network in Azure. 
-   [Review the supported Azure regions](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/references/supported_regions/#azure-regions) where you can create clusters for the Azure account, enabling you to locate your cloud resources close to your customers.
-   [View metrics and logs](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/using_cluster/monitoring_and_logging/monitoring_from_azure/) sent from Cloud Service in your Azure account. 
-   [Configure Azure](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/using_cluster/monitoring_and_logging/alerts/) to trigger real-time alerts based on the metrics in Cloud Service.
