To use AWS as your cloud account:

-   Sign in for the first time with your EDB account, and then either use the EDB Postgres AI Console as your identity provider or [set up your own provider](/edb-postgres-ai/console/using/organizations/identity_provider/) afterward. 
-   [Check the readiness of your AWS account](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/your_cloud_account/preparing_cloud_account/preparing_aws/) before deploying. 
-   [Connect your AWS cloud](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/your_cloud_account/connecting_to_your_cloud/connecting_aws/) to Cloud Service. 
-   [Connect to Cloud Service](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/using_cluster/connecting_your_cluster/02_connecting_from_aws/) using AWS VPC endpoint service. 
-   [Review the supported AWS regions](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/references/supported_regions/#aws-regions) where you can create clusters for the AWS account, enabling you to locate your cloud resources close to your customers. 
-   [View metrics and logs](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/using_cluster/monitoring_and_logging/monitoring_from_aws/) sent from Cloud Service with AWS CloudWatch.
