## What's next

### Log in

You can log in to your BigAnimal account using your Azure AD identity.

### Invite users

You can invite new users by sharing the link to the BigAnimal portal and having them log in with their Microsoft Azure Active Directory account. New users aren't assigned any roles by default. After they log in the first time, you see them in the User Management list and can assign them a role with permissions to BigAnimal. See [Users](/biganimal/release/administering_cluster/01_portal_access/#users) for instructions.

!!! Note
    Azure AD email domain is likely different from the email domain regularly used by your organization.
