description: How to activate, suspend, or delete regions for Your Cloud Account.

!!!note

   If you're using EDB Hosted Cloud Service, you don't need to activate regions. However, you can suspend and delete regions.

## Activate a new region from the Regions page

When you activate a region, Cloud Service prepares the compute and networking resources required to deploy clusters. These added resources can increase your cloud costs. 

You must activate a region before creating or restoring a cluster. 

Each region you activate displays a status. The status is available on the Create cluster and Restore cluster pages and the Regions page. For more information on the different region statuses, see [Region status reference](#region-status-reference).

You can activate a region ahead of time using the Regions page. 

1.  To activate a region before creating a cluster, go to the Regions page.
     

2.  If you haven't set up your cloud server provider (CSP), you're prompted to do so. See [Connecting your cloud](connecting_to_your_cloud/).

    When your cloud server provider is set up, you see a list of regions associated with it on the Regions page.

3.  Select **Activate New Region**, and select your cloud provider and the region you want to activate. You can activate multiple regions where you plan on adding clusters. 

4.  Select **Activate Region(s)**.

## Suspend, reactivate, or delete a region

Before you suspend or delete a region, you must delete all clusters in that region.

1.  On the left panel, select **Regions**.

    A list of previously activated regions appears. 
      
2.  Select the icons next to a region to: 
    -   Suspend or delete an active region. 
    -   Reactivate a suspended region.

| Activating | You have activated the region, and Cloud Service is setting up the compute and networking resources to support the cluster you requested. Backups and logs aren't available yet.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Active     | Cloud Service has completed setting up the compute and networking resources. The region has at least one cluster, and you can create more. The region has backups and logs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Suspended  | You have deleted any active clusters. Cloud Service has removed the compute and networking resources. The backups and logs are still available. EDB Postgres AI continues to maintain backups and logs based on the retention period set when the cluster was last active.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Deleted    | You have deleted the clusters. Cloud Service has removed the compute and networking resources. The backups and logs are no longer available. Only account owners can delete a region.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Error      | An error occurred while trying to activate or suspend the region. The cause might be a quota issue. See the topic for your cloud provider under [Checking your cloud readiness](preparing_cloud_account/) for information on checking whether requirements and resource limits are met and how to raise them, if needed. Contact [EDB Support](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/support_services/) if you need additional help troubleshooting the error. |
