!!! note
    Cloud Service is deployed in a VPC in your cloud service provider (CSP). To make changes or modify your Cloud Service clusters, use the EDB Postgres AI Console, API, or CLI to manage and execute the activity. You can also open a Support case if you need help. Making changes in the resources in those dedicated VPCs can affect EDB's ability to deliver service.


## Prerequisites

Ensure you have at least the following combined roles:
- roles/iam.serviceAccountCreator
- roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin
- roles/iam.roleAdmin
- roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin
- roles/compute.viewer

Alternatively, you can have an equivalent single role, such as:
- roles/owner

## Connecting your cloud

!!! tip
    If you're using Cloud Shell, add the `./` prefix to the `biganimal` command (`./biganimal`).
    
To connect your cloud:

1. Open Google Cloud Shell in your browser.

1.  Create a Cloud Service CLI credential:

   ```shell
   biganimal credential create --name <cred> 
   ```

1. To set up your cloud provider, run the `setup-csp` command:

   ```shell
    biganimal cloud-provider setup  
   ```
   The command checks for cloud account readiness and displays the results. 

1. If the following cloud readiness checks pass for your cloud service provider, your cloud account is successfully set up: 

   - Is the Google Cloud CLI configured to access your Google Cloud account?

   - Is the limit on the number of vCPUs and network load balancers (NLBs) in your region enough for your clusters?

   If the readiness checks aren't met, see [Configure your Google Cloud account](/biganimal/release/getting_started/preparing_cloud_account/preparing_gcp/#configure-your-google-cloud-account) to manually configure your cloud.
    
1.  Connect your cloud account to Cloud Service:

   ```shell
   biganimal cloud-provider connect --provider gcp --project <project-name>
   ```
 After your cloud account is successfully connected to Cloud Service, you and other users with the correct permissions can create clusters.
