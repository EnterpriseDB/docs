Use these techniques to connect to your cloud account.

## Cloud Service access requirements

Cloud Service needs access to your cloud to perform maintenance. Cloud Service CLI commands used for connecting your cloud to the Cloud Service set some of these permissions for you. For details on these and other permissions or policies required by Cloud Service, refer to the corresponding topic for your cloud provider.

Cloud Service also requires permissions to run Kubernetes cluster services for PostgreSQL workloads and the associated storage services. It requires a set of supporting permissions:

-   Services for monitoring and logging to produce service telemetry information

-   To set up networking so PostgreSQL workloads are reachable by customer applications and telemetry data is collected

-   To provision vaults for safe storage of data at rest encryption keys

-   To create workload identities and manage their permissions

-   A small set of supporting permissions to ensure access to the services above and availability of cloud account information

The scope of these permissions is limited to the associated cloud account. 

## Prerequisites

In your cloud provider shell, make sure that your environment is running:

-   Bash shell version 4.0 or above.
        
-   Cloud Service CLI version 2.0 or later. For details, see [Installing the CLI](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/using_cluster/cli/#installing-the-cli).

For additional cloud provider-specific requirements, see [Setting up specific cloud providers](#setting-up-specific-cloud-providers).

## Overview of connecting your cloud

!!! tip

    If you're using Cloud Shell, add the `./` prefix to the `biganimal` command (`./biganimal`).

1.  Open your cloud provider shell in your browser.

2.  Create a Cloud Service CLI credential:

    ```shell
    biganimal credential create --name <cred> 
    ```

3.  To set up your cloud provider, run the `cloud-provider setup` command :

    ```shell
    biganimal cloud-provider setup 
    ```

    !!! Important

        Don't delete the `ba-passport.json` file created in your working directory. It contains important identity and access management information used by `cloud-provider connect` while connecting to your cloud.

4.  If the cloud readiness checks pass, your cloud account is successfully set up. Connect your cloud account to Cloud Service:

    ```shell
    biganimal cloud-provider connect --provider  <cloud-service-provider> --project <project-name>
    ```

    Once your cloud account is successfully connected to Cloud Service, you and other users with the correct permissions can create clusters.
