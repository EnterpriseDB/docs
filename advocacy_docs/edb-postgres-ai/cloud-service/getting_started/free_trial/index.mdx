When you first sign up for BigAnimal, you'll have $300 in free credits to experience all the features and capabilities of BigAnimal.

## Create an account

To get started with BigAnimal, you'll need to [create an EDB account](detail/create_an_account). 

Registering an account on [enterprisedb.com](https://www.enterprisedb.com/) gives you access to BigAnimal, as well as EDB's training and software downloads. 
Accounts are free, and registration takes less than a minute.

## Start using BigAnimal

Once you have set up your account, you can log in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal with full access to all its features and capabilities. See [Quick start](quickstart) for a walkthrough of configuring a cluster and ideas for further exploration.

## What happens when you use up your free credits? 

If you want to keep your cluster live after your free credits run out, simply add a credit card or payment method (see [Payments and billing](/biganimal/latest/pricing_and_billing/#payments-and-billing)). If you donâ€™t add a credit card or payment method, your clusters and their backup data are deleted within seven days.
