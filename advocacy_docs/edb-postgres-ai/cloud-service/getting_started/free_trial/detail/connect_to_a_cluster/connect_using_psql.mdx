!!! Note
    You can find all of the parameters you need to connect on the portal by selecting the name of your cluster on the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page and then selecting the **Connect** tab.


[psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html) is the standard PostgreSQL [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop) 
and an all-around useful tool for working with PostgreSQL databases. In addition to letting you submit SQL and view the results, it offers quite a few built-in commands for
inspecting and managing the database that make light work of even complex tasks.

You can find an example of connecting to a BigAnimal cluster by way of psql right on your cluster's **Overview** tab on the portal. For example:

```shell
psql -W "postgres://edb_admin@p-xxxxxxxxxxx.pg.biganimal.io:5432/edb_admin?sslmode=require"
```

The URI is all that's necessary for psql. While you _can_ pass each element of that URL individually 
(pulling the information from the **Connect** tab on the portal, for instance), psql will parse it out for you and prompt for the password.

In case you're unfamiliar with PostgreSQL's URI format, you can find it documented [on postgresql.org](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#id-1.7.3.8.3.6).


!!! Note EDB Postgres Advanced Server enhancements
    If your cluster is running EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you might want to install the version of psql that ships with it. It includes a few nice additions, such as tab completion for Oracle database-compatible syntax. However, the standard PostgreSQL client works with EDB Postgres Advanced Server as well.
