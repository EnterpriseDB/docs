!!! note
    The BigAnimal CLI commands used for connecting your cloud to BigAnimal register an application with Azure AD and create a service principal to delegate identity and access management functions to Azure Active Directory (AD). For more information, see for [Azure EDB cloud utilities](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-utilities/tree/main/azure) in GitHub.

!!! note
    BigAnimal is deployed in a dedicated VNET in your cloud service provider (CSP). To make changes or modify your BigAnimal clusters, use the BigAnimal portal, API, or CLI to manage and execute the activity. You can also open a Support case if you need help. Making changes to the resources in those dedicated VPCs can affect EDB's ability to deliver service.
    

## Prerequisites
Before connecting to your cloud, make sure that you're assigned either the Global Administrator role or the Privileged Role Administrator role in Azure AD and that you have the Owner role for your BigAnimal Azure subscription.

## Connecting your cloud

!!! tip
    If you're using Cloud Shell, add the `./` prefix to the `biganimal` command (`./biganimal`).
    
To connect your cloud:

1. Open the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) in your browser.

1.  Create a BigAnimal CLI credential:

   ```shell
   biganimal credential create --name <cred> 
   ```

1. To set up your cloud provider, run the `cloud-provider setup` command:

    ```shell
    biganimal cloud-provider setup 
    ```
  The command checks for cloud account readiness and displays the results. 

1. If the following readiness checks aren't met, see [Configure your Azure subscription](/biganimal/release/getting_started/preparing_cloud_account/01_preparing_azure#configure-your-azure-subscription) to manually configure your cloud:

    - Are the necessary Azure resource providers registered for your subscription?

    - Is there a restriction on SKUs for the standard Esv3 family and standard D2_v4 VM size?
    - Is the limit on the number of vCPU and public IP addresses in your region enough for your clusters?

  If the cloud readiness checks pass, your cloud account is successfully set up. 
  
  !!! Note
      At this point, you can't change the Azure subscription, as you have already provided the Azure subscription ID.
  
1. Connect your cloud account to BigAnimal:

   ```shell
   biganimal cloud-provider connect --provider azure --project <project-name>
   ```

After your cloud account is successfully connected to BigAnimal, you and other users with the correct permissions can create clusters.
