Follow this quick walkthrough to configure a Postgres cluster on BigAnimal. 

## Step 1: Create an account and sign into the portal

If you haven't done so already, you'll need to [create your EDB account](detail/create_an_account). 

Registering an account on [enterprisedb.com](https://www.enterprisedb.com/) gives you access to BigAnimal, as well as EDB's training and software downloads. 
Accounts are free, and registration takes less than a minute.

Then, use your newly created account to access the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal.

## Step 2: Create a cluster 

1. On the overview page, select **Create New Cluster**.

    You should now find yourself at the [Create Cluster page](https://portal.biganimal.com/create-cluster).

1. Select the options for your cluster. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/) for more information.

## Step 3: Connect to your new cluster

1. Select your cluster to get an overview of how it has been configured. Select the **Connect** tab to see more information about how to connect to your cluster.

2. Select the **Overview** tab and copy the **Quick Connect** command. Paste it into a terminal where psql is installed. It will prompt for your password and put you on a SQL command line. For example:

   ```shell
   psql -W "postgres://edb_admin@p-qzwv2ns7pj.pg.biganimal.io:5432/edb_admin?sslmode=require"
   Password:
   __OUTPUT__ 
   psql (15.2) 
   SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, compression: off)
   Type "help" for help.

   edb_admin=> 
   ```

!!! Note
While psql is a good all-around option for working with Postgres databases, you can use the client of your choice. See [Connect to a cluster](detail/connect_to_a_cluster) for more ideas.

## Explore using your cluster

### Create a new database

We're going to create some sample math data, so we're going to create a database called `math`. We could use the default `edb_admin` database, but best practice is to isolate data.

1. Create a new `math` database.

   ```sql
   create user math with password 'math_password';
   create database math;
   ```

2. Grant the `math` role to edb_admin.
   
   ```sql
   grant math to edb_admin;
   ```
2. Connect to the `math` database. You're prompted for the edb_admin password you provided in Step 2.

   ```sql
   \connect math
   ```

### Populate a table and query it

We're going to use temporary tables to calculate prime numbers using a [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).

1. Create a table called `primes` for storing prime numbers.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE primes (
     num INTEGER,
     PRIMARY KEY (num)
   );
   ```

2. Populate the table with all prime numbers up to 1000. (This code is based on [code from David Fetter](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).)

   ```sql
   -- Based on https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes
   
   WITH RECURSIVE
   t0(m) AS (
       VALUES(1000)
   ),
   t1(n) AS (
       VALUES(2)
   UNION ALL
       SELECT n+1 FROM t1 WHERE n < (SELECT m FROM t0)
   ),
   t2 (n, i) AS (
       SELECT 2*n, 2
       FROM t1 WHERE 2*n <= (SELECT m FROM t0)
   UNION ALL
       (
           WITH t3(k) AS (
               SELECT max(i) OVER () + 1 FROM t2
           ),
           t4(k) AS (
               SELECT DISTINCT k FROM t3
           )
           SELECT k*n, k
           FROM
               t1
           CROSS JOIN
               t4
           WHERE k*k <= (SELECT m FROM t0)
       )
   )
   INSERT INTO primes (
     SELECT n FROM t1 EXCEPT
     SELECT n FROM t2
     ORDER BY 1
   );
   ```

3. Select the largest prime number less than 1000.

   ```sql
   SELECT max(num)
   FROM primes
   WHERE num < 1000;
   ```

!!! note
If you want to keep your cluster live after your free credits run out, simply add a credit card or payment method (see [Payments and billing](/biganimal/latest/pricing_and_billing/#payments-and-billing)). If you donâ€™t add a credit card or payment method, your clusters and their backup data are deleted within seven days.
