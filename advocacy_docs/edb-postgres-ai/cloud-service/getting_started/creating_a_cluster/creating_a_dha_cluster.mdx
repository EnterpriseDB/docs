!!!Note "When using your cloud"
Before creating your cluster, make sure you have enough resources. Without enough resources, your request to create a cluster fails. 
- If your cloud provider is Azure, see [Preparing your Azure account](/biganimal/release/getting_started/preparing_cloud_account/01_preparing_azure).
- If your cloud provider is AWS, see [Preparing your AWS account](/biganimal/release/getting_started/preparing_cloud_account/02_preparing_aws).
- If your cloud provider is Google Cloud, see [Preparing your Google Cloud account](/biganimal/release/getting_started/preparing_cloud_account/preparing_gcp).
- Activate a region before cluster creation. See [Activating regions](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/activating_regions).
!!!

!!!note "When using BigAnimal's cloud"
The following options aren't available when creating your cluster:
- AWS IAM authentication
- Superuser access
- PgBouncer 
!!!


1.  Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal.

1.  On the **Overview** or **Clusters** page, select **Create New** > **Database cluster**.
1.  On the **Create Cluster** page, start with the **Cluster Info** tab.

## Cluster Info tab 

1. Select the type of cluster to deploy. 

    -  [Distributed High Availability](../../overview/02_high_availability/distributed_highavailability/) creates a cluster, powered by EDB Postgres Distributed, with up to two data groups spread across multiple cloud regions to deliver higher performance and faster recovery.<br/><br/>
    
    If you want to create a single-node or primary/standby high-availability cluster, follow the [Single Node or Primary/Standby High Availability](.) page.
    
    See [Supported cluster types](/biganimal/latest/overview/02_high_availability/) for more information about the different cluster types.

    !!!Note
       You can't switch from a single-node or primary/standby high-availability cluster to a distributed high-availability cluster or vice versa. 

1. Select the type of cloud account for your cluster. You can choose BigAnimal's cloud account or set up your own. For more information, see [Deployment options](../../planning/deployment_options).

    !!! Note
         If you use BigAnimal's cloud account, your estimated cloud infrastructure costs are calculated into your cluster's estimated monthly price shown at the bottom of the page. 

1. Select **Next: Cluster Settings**

## Cluster Settings tab

1.  In the **Cluster Name** field, enter the name for your cluster.

1.  In the **Password** field, enter a password for your cluster. This is the password for the user edb_admin.

1.  Under **Tags**, select **+**.

1.  To assign an existing tag, in the search bar under **Tags**, enter a tag name. To add a new tag, instead select **+ Add Tag**.

1.  Select **Next: Data Groups**.

## Data Groups Tab

1.  Go to the **Node Settings** tab for the first Data Group. In the **Nodes** section, select **Two Data Nodes** or **Three Data Nodes**.  

     For more information on node architecture, see [Distributed high availability](../../overview/02_high_availability/distributed_highavailability/).

1.  In the **Provider & Region** section, select the cloud provider and region where you want to deploy your cluster.

    !!! Tip
        For the best performance, we strongly recommend that this region be the same as your other resources that communicate with your cluster. For a list of available regions, see [Supported regions](../../overview/03a_region_support). If you're interested in deploying a cluster to a region that isn't currently available, contact [Support](/biganimal/latest/overview/support/). 
 
1.  In the **Database Type** section:

    1. Select the type of Postgres you want to use in the **Postgres Type** field:

        -  **[EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/)** is EDB's Oracle-compatible database offering. View [a quick demonstration of Oracle compatibility on BigAnimal](../../using_cluster/06_demonstration_oracle_compatibility).

        - **[EDB Postgres Extended Server](/pge/latest/)** is EDB's advanced logical replication, PostgreSQL-compatible database offering.  
  
    1.  In the **Postgres Version** list, select the version of Postgres that you want to use. 

1.  In the **Instance Type** section: 

    1. Select the category that works best for your applications and workload: 
       - Memory optimized for large data sets
       - Compute optimized for compute bound applications
       - General purpose if you don't require memory or compute optimization 
    1. Select the instance series and size. See [Sizes for virtual machines in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes), [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/), or the [Google Cloud Machine families resource and comparison guide](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-resource) for information to help you choose the appropriate instance type. 
       !!!note
          When provisioning a cluster, some CPU and memory resources are reserved for use by BigAnimal and your cloud provider. For example, when using Kubernetes, provisioning a server with 8GB of memory yields only about 6GB of memory after accounting for the requirements of Kubernetes and BigAnimal.
       
       !!!tip
          To maximize your disk size for AWS, select R5b as your instance and then io2 Block Express as your storage to get a maximum disk size of 64 TB and 256,000 IOPS.
  
1.  In the **Storage** section:

    !!!tip
       When choosing your storage options, for most workloads, consider using at least 20GB of storage. 

    By default, the **Database Storage** volume stores the Postgres data and the write-ahead logs (WAL) together. If you want to improve write performance for WAL files, you can allocate separate storage volume for the WAL files. To allocate separate storage volume for WAL files, select **Use a separate storage volume for Write-Ahead Logs**. Then select the volume type, size, IOPS, and disk throughput separately for **Database Storage** and **Write-Ahead Logs Storage**. If you allocate separate storage volume for the WAL files, you have to pay cloud infrastructure costs for the second volume. Once separate storage volume is allocated for WAL files, you can't remove it from the cluster settings later on.

    From the **Volume Type** list, select your volume type. 

    <details><summary>Azure</summary>
    
    For Azure, in **Volume Type**, select **Premium SSD** or **Ultra Disk**. Compared to Premium SSD volumes, ultra disks offer lower-latency, high-performance options and direct control over your disk's input/output operations per second (IOPS). For BigAnimal, we recommend using ultra disks for workloads that require the most demanding performance. See [Using Azure ultra disks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-enable-ultra-ssd?tabs=azure-portal) for more information. 
    
       - For Premium SSD, in **Volume Properties**, select the type and amount of storage needed for your cluster. See [Azure Premium SSD storage types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types#premium-ssds) for more information. 

       - For ultra disk, in **Volume Properties**, select the disk size and IOPS for your cluster. BigAnimal calculates disk throughput based on your IOPS settings, but you have the option of updating the value. 

    !!!important
       While setting the required IOPS for the disk that you selected, consider the VM limits that are tied to the VM size that you selected. See [Ultra disk IOPS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types#ultra-disk-iops) for more information.
    
    </details>

    <details><summary>AWS</summary>

    For AWS, in **Volume Type**, select **General Purpose SSD (GP3)**, **io2**, or **io2 Block Express**.
      
    !!!Note
       io2 Block Express is available for selected instance types, such as R5b. However, you can't switch between io2 and io2 Block Express after creating your cluster.
     
    In **Volume Properties**, select the disk size for your cluster, and configure the IOPS.

    </details>

    <details><summary>GCP</summary>

    For Google Cloud, in  **Volume Type**, select **SSD Persistent Disk**. 
         
    In **Volume Properties**, select the disk size for your cluster.

    </details>
    <br/>

    !!!note Note for all cloud providers
       When provisioning database storage, not all of the storage space you specify is available for holding your data. Some space is reserved for other purposes. For a full explanation of the structure of a Postgres data directory, see [Database File Layout](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-file-layout.html). You can make more storage space available for data if you specify separate storage for WAL. 

1.  In the **Networking** section:

    In **Connectivity Type**, specify whether to use private or public networking. Networking is set to **Public** by default. Public means that any client can connect to your cluster's public IP address over the internet. Optionally, you can limit traffic to your public cluster by specifying an IP allowlist, which allows access only to certain blocks of IP addresses. To limit access, select **Use allowlists** and add one or more classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) blocks. CIDR is a method for allocating IP addresses and IP routing to a whole network or subnet. If you have any CIDR block entries, access is limited to those IP addresses. If none are specified, all network traffic is allowed. 

    Private networking allows only IP addresses in your private network to connect to your cluster.  

    If you're using private networking and you're using BigAnimal's cloud account, you must enter your cloud service provider's account information. BigAnimal uses it to auto-approve your private endpoints and also to provide access for logging and telemetry. To enable you to create your private endpoint, BigAnimal provides you with the corresponding service name, which you can use to connect to your cluster privately. 
    
    See [Cluster networking architecture](01_cluster_networking) for more information. 

1.  To take the snapshot backups, enable **Volume Snapshots**. The snapshot backups are stored on the disk in the same region without degrading the performance. Enabling **Volume Snapshots** might increase the storage costs on your cloud service provider. By default, the snapshot backups are stored on the disk for 30 days.

1.  In the **Backups** section:

    Change the default database backup retention period of 30 days using the
    **Retention Period** controls. You can configure
    the retention period to a number of days, weeks, or months. The retention
    period must be between 1-180 days, 1-25 weeks, or 1-6 months.

    BigAnimal deletes backups older than the retention period.

1.  In the **Maintenance** section:

    The **Custom Maintenance Window** is enabled and set for a weekly 60-minute maintenance window in which maintenance upgrades occur for the cluster. You can change the maintenance window to a time that works best for you.

    !!! Note
        Typically, maintenance updates take only a few minutes to complete.

    For more information, see [Periodic maintenance](/biganimal/release/overview/updates).

1.  In the **Connections** section: 
    
    When enabled, the **Read-only Workloads** option configures a connection string you can use for read-only operations to lighten the workload on the write leader and improve the cluster's performance.

    See [Read-only workloads](../../overview/02_high_availability/distributed_highavailability/#read-only-workloads) for more information.

1.  Select **Next: DB Configuration**

1.  In the **Parameters** section on the **DB Configuration** tab, you can update the value of the database configuration parameters for the data group as needed.

    To update the parameter values, see [Modifying your database configuration parameters](../../using_cluster/03_modifying_your_cluster/05_db_configuration_parameters).

1.  Select **Create: Data Group**. The data group preview appears. 

1.  If you want to create a second data group, select **Add a Data Group**. To finish creating your cluster, select **Create Cluster**. 

## Creating a second data group

After creating the first data group, you can create a second data group for your distributed high-availability cluster by selecting **Add a Data Group** before you create the cluster. 

By default, the settings for your first data group populate the second data group's settings. However, you can change certain settings if you want to. Just know that your changes can change the settings for the entire cluster. That being said, the database type and cloud provider must be consistent across both data groups. 

The data groups and the witness group must all be in different regions. Otherwise, you can choose the second data group's settings as needed. 

When choosing the number of data nodes for the second data group, see [Distributed high availability](../../overview/02_high_availability/distributed_highavailability/) for information on node architecture.

!!! Note
     To maintain high availability, BigAnimal doesn't allow the maintenance windows of data groups to overlap.
