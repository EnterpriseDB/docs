BigAnimal provides two options for setting up and accessing a cloud account for your new database:

- [Using BigAnimal's cloud account](#getting-started-using-a-biganimal-cloud-account)

- [Using your own cloud account with BigAnimal](#getting-started-using-your-own-cloud-account)

## Getting started using a BigAnimal cloud account 

Use the following high-level steps to set up a BigAnimal account and begin using your new database.

1. Create an EDB account. For more information, see [Create an EDB account](../free_trial/detail/create_an_account/). After setting up the account, you can access all of the features and capabilities of the BigAnimal portal. 

1. Create a cluster. When prompted for **Where to deploy**, select **BigAnimal**. See [Creating a cluster](../creating_a_cluster/). 

1. Use your cluster. See [Using your cluster](../using_cluster/).

## Getting started using your own cloud account

Use the following high-level steps to connect BigAnimal to your own cloud account and begin using your new database. 

1. Ensure you have the correct access permissions for your cloud account. 

    - Azure &mdash; Global Administrator or Privileged Role Administrator, and you must be a Subscription Owner.

    - AWS &mdash; IAMFullAccess policy and ServiceQuotasFullAccess policy.

    - Google Cloud &mdash; roles/owner or at least the following combined roles:

        - roles/iam.serviceAccountCreator

        - roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin

        - roles/iam.roleAdmin

        - roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin
        
        - roles/compute.viewer

1. Create an EDB account. See [Create an EDB account](../free_trial/detail/create_an_account/).

    1. Go to [https://portal.biganimal.com](https://portal.biganimal.com).

    1. Select **EDB Account**.

    1. Under the login boxes, select **Create EDB account**. 

    1. On the next page, complete the required information.
        After providing the account request information, you will receive an email from EDB. Finish your account activation by selecting the activation link in the email. The activation link expires in 72 hours.

    1. When prompted, create a password for your new EDB account. 
    
  
1. Set up your own identity provider. For more information see [Setting up your identity provider](identity_provider/).
    
1. Set up a CLI. See [Using the BigAnimal CLI](../reference/cli/). 
   Although we recommend using a CLI, it isn't required.

1. Prepare your cloud to work with BigAnimal. You must do this every time you create a new cluster. The required steps vary by cloud provider. See:

    - [Preparing your Azure account](preparing_cloud_account/01_preparing_azure/).

    - [Preparing your AWS account](preparing_cloud_account/02_preparing_aws/).

    - [Preparing your Google Cloud account](preparing_cloud_account/preparing_gcp/).

1. Connect to your cloud. See [Connecting to your cloud](02_connecting_to_your_cloud/).

1. Activate and manage regions. See [Managing regions](activating_regions/). 

1. Create a cluster. When prompted for **Where to deploy**, select **Your Cloud Account**. See [Creating a cluster](../creating_a_cluster/). 

1. Use your cluster. See [Using your cluster](../using_cluster/).

1. Optionally, set up private networking to allow you to connect to your cluster from other applications. The steps depend on your cloud service provider. See:

    - [Connecting from Azure](../using_cluster/02_connecting_your_cluster/01_connecting_from_azure/)

    - [Connecting from AWS](../using_cluster/02_connecting_your_cluster/02_connecting_from_aws/)

    - [Connecting from Google Cloud](../using_cluster/02_connecting_your_cluster/connecting_from_gcp/)

1. Provide access to other users. See [Managing user access](../administering_cluster/01_portal_access/).
