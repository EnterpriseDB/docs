EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service provides hosted and managed Postgres database clusters within the EDB Postgres AI platform. 

## Get an EDB Account

To get started with EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service databases you will need an EDB Postgres AI account.

Create an EDB account. For more information, see [Create an EDB account](../../console/using/introduction/#accessing-the-edb-postgres-ai-console). After setting up the account, you can access all of the features and capabilities of the EDB Postgres AI console. 

EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service can host your database for you on AWS, GCP, or Azure managing the infrastructure and billing in one place - this is using EDB Hosted Cloud Service - or you can use your own cloud account to have databases deployed into your own cloud - this is using Your Cloud Account.

If you want to use your cloud account, go to our [Getting Started with your cloud account](your_cloud_account/getting_started_with_your_cloud_account) section which covers the steps needed to prepare your cloud account for Cloud Service clusters.

For the rest of this Getting Started section, we will use EDB Hosted Cloud Service databases, because they are easy to deploy and do not require any management work on the cloud provider. The same steps apply to both EDB Hosted and Your Cloud Account databases.

## Creating a database cluster

From the Console, navigate to a project. From within the Project overview, select **Create New** and then select **Database Cluster**.

This will take you to the Create Cluster page. For more details on the options available here, See the [Creating a cluster](../getting_started/creating_cluster/) section. 

## Using your cluster

See the [Using your cluster](../using_cluster/) section.
