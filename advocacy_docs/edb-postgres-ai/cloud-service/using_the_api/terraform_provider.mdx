title: EDB Cloud Service Terraform provider
---

The [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/EnterpriseDB/biganimal/latest/docs) of EDB Postgres AIÂ® Cloud Service is an infrastructure-as-code service that allows you to provision cloud resources with the Terraform CLI and incorporate those resources into your existing EDB Cloud Service infrastructure workflows.  

The current version of the Terraform provider offers resources and data sources for creating, reading, updating, and deleting clusters and regions.

The current version of the Terraform provider offers resources and data sources for:

-   Creating, updating, and deleting clusters.
-   Creating, updating, and deleting faraway replicas. Promoting faraway replica isn't supported in the current version.
-   Activating and deactivating regions.
-   Creating projects. Connecting the cloud service provider isn't supported in the current version.

The Terraform provider is licensed under the [MPL v2](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/).

!!!note

   We provide support for the Cloud Service Terraform provider and not for the underlying environment. 
   To report suspected defects or to submit feature requests, open a GitHub issue using the guidance found [here](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/terraform-provider-biganimal/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#report-an-issue).

## Prerequisites

To use Terraform with Cloud Service, you need: 

-   An EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service account with an organization set up. If you don't already have an account, see [Getting started with Cloud Service](/biganimal/latest/free_trial).

-   [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) (version 0.13*x* or later) downloaded and installed.

-   A Cloud Service API token for use within the Terraform application. See [Getting an API Token](#getting-an-api-token).

## Example usage

```hcl
# Configure the Provider for Cloud Service
provider "biganimal" {
  ba_bearer_token = "<redacted>"
  // ba_access_key: if set, this will be used instead of the ba_bearer_token above.
  // This can also be set as an environment variable. If it is set both here and
  // in an environment variable then the access key set in the environment variable
  // will take priority and be used
  ba_access_key = "<redacted>"
}
# Manage the resources
```

## Environment Variables

Credentials can be provided by using the `BA_BEARER_TOKEN` or `BA_ACCESS_KEY` environment variables.

## Schema

### Optional

-   `ba_access_key` (String) Cloud Service Access Key
-   `ba_bearer_token` (String) Cloud Service Bearer Token

## Getting an API token

To use the Cloud Service API, fetch an API bearer token and export it into your environment. (For additional information about using the Cloud Service API, see [here](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/using_the_api/).) Optionally, credentials can be provided by using the `BA_API_URI` environment variable.

1.  Access the script located [here](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-utilities/blob/main/api/get-token.sh).
2.  Open the script in `Raw` format.
3.  Copy the script and save it locally with the name `get-token.sh`.
4.  Modify permissions for the script in your local shell.
5.  Run the script locally using a command like the following:
    ```
     sh <local path>/get-token.sh
    ```
    The resulting output instructs you to log in to a URL with an 8-digit user code. For example: 
    ```
     Please login to https://auth.biganimal.com/activate?user_code=JWPL-RCXL with your Cloud Service account
    ```
6.  In a browser, access the URL, confirm, and reauthenticate if necessary. 
    A notice lets you know that the code was verified.
7.  In your local shell, a prompt asks:
    ```
     Have you finished the login successfully. (y/n)
    ```
8.  Enter `y`. The shell responds with output that provides the access token, refresh token, scope, expiration period, and token type.
9.  Export the access token into your environment as follows, replacing `<REDACTED>` with the access token:
    ```bash
    export BA_BEARER_TOKEN=<REDACTED>
    ```
    Rather than export the token, you can alternatively use the token to set the value of the `ba_bearer_token` when configuring the Cloud Service provider, as shown in [Example usage](#example-usage).  
10. Now you can follow along with the [examples](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/terraform-provider-biganimal/blob/main/examples/README.md) in the Terraform repository.
