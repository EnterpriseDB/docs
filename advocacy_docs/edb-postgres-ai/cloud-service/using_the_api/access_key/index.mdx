title: "Access key for API"

An access key provides an authentication process for Cloud Service users to access the Cloud Service API directly, without the `OAuth2` authorization flow. The access key links to only one user. Each access key link is immutable since its creation. Each access key has an expiration time you specify, ranging from 1 to 365 days.

An access key belongs to only one organization. An access key can be created for a [machine user](/edb-postgres-ai/console/using/organizations/machine_users/) or for a normal user. A normal user can't use their access key across the organizations. The key is managed by an organization owner for the machine user, whereas the normal user manages their own access key. Once the access key expires, you must create a new one. Also, if you lose the access key, you have to delete it and create a new one.

An access key can be revoked from a user. Revoking the key doesn't affect the role or any other authentication process of the linked user.

## Create your personal access key

To create an access key:

1.  Log in to the EDB Postgres AI Console.
2.  From the menu next to your organization name in the top right of the portal, select **My Account**.
3.  From the My Account page, select the **Access Keys** tab.
4.  From the **Access Keys** tab, select **Create New Key**.
5.  Provide the **Access Key Name**.
6.  Provide the **Expiry days** in the range of 1 to 365.

    The generated access key is provided for the user. 

Copy this access key and save it in a secure location. The access key is available only when you create it. If you lose your access key, you must delete it and create a new one. 

You can enable in-app inbox or email notifications so that you're alerted when your personal key is about to expire. For more information, see [Managing notifications](/edb-postgres-ai/console/using/notifications/#managing-notifications).

## Manage access key

You can manage the access keys for a machine user from the **Users** home page. 

To view details about a user's access keys:

1.  From the menu next to your organization name in the top right of the portal, select **Users Management** .
2.  Select the **Username** from the list.
3.  View the **Access Keys** tab on the user's home page. Each row provides the access key details:
    -   **Name** — Access key name.
    -   **Access Key** — Access key in half encrypted format.
    -   **Expiry at** — The expiry date for the access key.
    -   **Created at** — The creation date for the access key.

To delete a specific key, select **Delete** next to the key. You're prompted to confirm the deletion.

To create a key, select **Create New Key** at the top-right corner of the **Access Keys** tab.

## Using the access key

The Cloud Service API detects if the caller is using an access key in the request. If the caller uses the access key, the API checks:

-   The validity of the key
-   The organization of the user requesting access
-   The user permissions

It then authorizes the access. For more information, see [Using the Cloud Service API](../api.mdx).
