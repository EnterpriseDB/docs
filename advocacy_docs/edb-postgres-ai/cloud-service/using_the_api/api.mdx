---

!!!important "Deprecation notice"

EDB released v3 of Cloud Service API in January 2023. v2 of Cloud Service API goes out of support on June 30, 2023. To see the changes in v3, see the [Change log](https://portal.biganimal.com/api/docs/v3migration.html). Update your applications accordingly.
!!!

Use the Cloud Service API to integrate directly with Cloud Service for management activities such as cluster provisioning, deprovisioning, and scaling.

The API reference documentation is available from the [Console](https://portal.biganimal.com). To access the documentation directly, go to [API docs](https://portal.biganimal.com/api/docs/).

## Prerequisite

Before calling API, create an access key. For more information, see [Access key](access_key/).

## Call the API

To call the Cloud Service API, your application must pass the retrieved access key as a bearer token in the `x-access-key` header of your HTTP request. For example:

```shell
curl --request GET \
  --url "https://portal.biganimal.com/api/v3/projects" \
  --header "x-access-key: $ACCESS_KEY"
```

Where the `ACCESS_KEY` variable is the access key's text copied from the BigAnimal UI.

Example response:

```json
{
    "projectId": "prj_abcd1234",
    "projectName": "Test project",
    "clusterCount": 4,
    "userCount": 10,
    "cloudProviders": [
    {
       "cloudProviderId": "aws",
       "cloudProviderName": "AWS"
    },
    {
       "cloudProviderId": "azure",
       "cloudProviderName": "Azure"
    }
  ]
}
```
