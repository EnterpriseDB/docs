## Viewing your Support cases

After you create your Support case, you can view the case and the case history and monitor the status of your case at the [My activities](https://support.biganimal.com/hc/en-us/requests) page in the [Support portal](https://support.biganimal.com/hc/en-us). Select your image in the top-right corner of the Support portal, and then select **My Activities** from the menu.

If your login account has your email address, or if you submit the case by email or the Support web widget, you receive the case information by email. The case request number displays in the email subject line.

A case can have one of the following statuses: 
-   **Open:** A new case or reopened case.
-   **Awaiting your reply:** Cloud Service Support has responded to your case and is asking for more information or letting you know that the case is resolved and asking for you to confirm.
-   **Resolved:** The case is resolved. 

## Updating your Support cases

You can update your case at the bottom of the request page in **Add to conversation**. You can view BigAnimal Support's case updates at the request page. 

If your login account has your email address, or you submit the case by email or the Support web widget, you can update the case or receive the case updates from Support by email.

## Searching for Support cases

From the **My requests** list at the [My activities](https://support.biganimal.com/hc/en-us/requests) page in the [Support portal](https://support.biganimal.com/hc/en-us), you can search for all of your Support cases using the search bar. You can also filter the cases by status.

## Reopening Support cases

You can reopen the case after it's set to **Solved** by responding with a new comment. You can reopen your Support case up to seven calendar days after case resolution. 

If your login account has your email address, or you submit the case by email or Support web widget, you can reopen the case by replying to the last email of the case prior to the survey email.

You can't reopen Support cases that are in the resolved state for more than seven calendar days. However, you can create a follow-up from the original case. To create a follow-up, select the link at the bottom of the case. The follow-up creates a new case linked to the original case.

## Resolving a Support case

You can resolve the case by adding a new comment and selecting **Mark as solved**. Our Support team changes the status of the case to Resolved after receiving your confirmation.  

## Case survey

The BigAnimal Support team asks that you provide feedback on your experience by completing the survey on the request page. The survey is available one day after the case is resolved. The survey remains open for six days. 

If your login account has your email address, or you submit the case by email or Support web widget, you receive the survey email. You can select the survey link in the email to submit a survey.

Our Support team reviews the survey results to improve the support experience and appreciates your feedback.
