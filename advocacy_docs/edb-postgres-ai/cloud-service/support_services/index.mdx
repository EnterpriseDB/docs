If you have problems with Cloud Service, you have several options to get help from EDB's Support team. If you have a Cloud Service account, you can go directly to the Support portal or the Console to open a Support case, or you can leave Support a message using the Support Case widget. 

If you can’t log in to your account or are having issues using the widget, send us an email at [cloudsupport@enterprisedb.com](mailto:cloudsupport@enterprisedb.com).

See [Managing your Support cases](01_case_management) for more information.
