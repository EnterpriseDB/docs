If you have problems with Cloud Service, you have several options to get help from EDB's Support team. If you have a Cloud Service account, you can go directly to the Support portal or the Console to open a Support case, or you can leave Support a message using the Support Case widget. 

If you canâ€™t log in to your account or are having issues using the widget, send us an email at [techsupport@enterprisedb.com](mailto:techsupport@enterprisedb.com).


## Case severity level

| Level      | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Severity 1 | The cloud service is down, or there's an error with critical impact on your production environment. Covers urgent problems including database service outage, data loss, and cluster provisioning failure.                                 |
| Severity 2 | There's a cloud service error or an issue significantly impacting your production environment. The system is functioning but in a severely reduced capacity. Covers problems including database service interruption and backup failures. |
| Severity 3 | There's an error or issue that doesn't have a significant impact on your production environment. Covers problems including API issues, monitoring metrics, and logging issues.                                                            |
| Severity 4 | General questions, inquiries, or nontechnical requests.   

## Best practices

- Have at least two account owners assigned to your Cloud Service and cloud service provider accounts.

- Add techsupport@enterprisedb.com to your email allowed list to avoid missing emails from the Cloud Service Support team.
