With Schema Ingestion enabled, the following information gets sent to the EDB Postgres AI control plane and included within your Estate:

* Schema names
* Table names
* Table types
* Column names
* Column types
* Column default values
* Column nullablity
* Table description (from comments)
* Column description (from comments)

The schema ingestion process is secure and doesn't collect any data from the tables themselves. If the schema information contains personally identifying information (PII), such as customer names as a column name, then that PII will be ingested into the Estate.
