The **Activity Log** displays the a table view of the activity that has taken place in the project over a specified time. The activity log shows the date and time of the activity, the user who performed the activity, the activity type and a description of the activity. At the top of the table is a filter bar allowing you to focus on particular activity types. 

There are also options to control the sort order of the table and to download the activity log as a CSV file.

You can display the Activity Log page by selecting the **Activity Log** option from the project's menus. This menu item is only available to users with the **Project owner** or **Project editor** roles.
