description: How to view self-managed Postgres clusters in your EDB Postgres AI Estate.
---

Monitoring the database assets that you manage on your own infrastructure is a key part of managing your EDB Postgres AI Estate. 

You can include self-managed Postgres clusters installed both on-premises and in the cloud as part of your EDB Estate view by using an agent. The agent collects metrics from an associated cluster and feeds it to the EDB Estate. Itâ€™s in this pane that the information appears.

## Configuring Self-managed Postgres

The **Configure Agent** button takes you through the steps needed to configure the Estate to receive data from an agent. See the [Agent](../../estate/agent/) documentation for more details and in particular [Install Agent](../../estate/agent/install-agent/) on how to install the agent on your platform.
