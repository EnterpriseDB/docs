Clusters includes any Postgres cluster created by and managed by EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service. EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service can host these clusters on any supported cloud service provider (AWS, Azure, GCP), or it can host them using your own account on any cloud service provider. 

Also included in this view are EDB Postgres AI Lakehouse analytics clusters, managed as part of the Cloud Service. 

## Clusters view in the single pane of glass

The single pane of glass view shows a color-coded snapshot of the clusters, along with a textual description of which cloud service providers are in use and how many are Cloud Service clusters, Cloud Hosted, or Self Managed clusters.

Selecting **View Estate** takes you to the full estate view.

## Full Clusters view

In the full clusters view, you can see all the clusters in your Estate. The view is similar to the project view but includes an additional **Project** column to show which project the cluster belongs to. You can select a cluster's project to go directly to the project view.

Selecting a clusters name brings up a cluster details view that shows:
* Cluster name
* Performance metrics including memory, CPU, storage, transaction rate and database size
* An overview of the cluster's configuration including:
  * Cluster type
  * Number of nodes
  * Deployment type
  * Cloud service provider
  * Region
  * Postgres type and version
  * Provisioned instance type and size
  * Provisioned storage volume type and properties
  * Backup retention policy
* A psql command to connect to the cluster

Clusters with a green circle are running, those with a red circle are paused and those with a blue circle are recently deleted.

Running clusters have an ellipsis menu button that when selected, provides the following options:

| Option                                       | Description                                      |
|----------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|

## Creating a new cluster

The **Create New** button allows you to create a new Database cluster or Lakehouse analytics cluster in any of your projects. First, select between creating a Database cluster or a  Lakehouse analytics node. 

If you only have one project, the creation operation automatically uses it. If you have more than one project, a menu of available projects to create your cluster in pops-up for you to select which project the cluster should appear in.

After selecting the project you are taken to the Cloud Service's [Create Cluster](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/creating_cluster/) page where you can configure the cluster.
