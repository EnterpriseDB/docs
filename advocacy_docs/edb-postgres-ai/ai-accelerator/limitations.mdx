### Blocking Operations

* Pipelines currently does not support asynchronous operations. All pipeline operations are blocking and take place in the foreground.
The impact of this depends on what type of pipeline is being performed.
  * When executing bulk data preparation or bulk embedding, the system will be blocked until the operation is complete for all the items currently in the database or storage.
  * When using auto-embedding, the system will be blocked until the embedding is complete for each item being inserted or updated.

### Observability

* Observability is currently limited to the logs and metrics provided by the underlying components. There is no single pane of glass for monitoring the entire system.

* Monitoring progress of initial pipeline execution is also not currently available. We recommend using the system logs to track progress.

### Data Filtering

* While Pipelines can use SQL filters and views based on the content of rows to limit embedded documents, the system does not currently support the ability to similarly filter on data in S3 storage. It is limited to using sub-paths and prefix filtering.

### Load Balancing for Models

* There is currently no load balancing mechanism for model access.

### Data Formats

* Retriever Pipelines currently only supports Text and Image formats. Other formats, including structured data, video, and audio, are not currently supported.

### Auto-Embedding for Images

* Auto-Embedding is only supported for text data. Image data embeddings can be manually computed.

### Auto-Data Preparation

* Auto-Data Preparation is not currently supported. Data can be manually prepared in bulk for embedding.

### Upgrading

When upgrading the aidb and pgfs extension, there is currently no support for Postgres extension upgrades. You must therefor drop and recreate the extensions when upgrading to a new version of the extensions.

```sql
DROP EXTENSION aidb CASCADE;
DROP EXTENSION pgfs CASCADE;
CREATE EXTENSION aidb CASCADE;
CREATE EXTENSION pgfs CASCADE;
```
