## What is PGvector

PGvector is an extension for Postgres that enables efficient storage and similarity search of high-dimensional vector data, commonly used for machine learning models, recommendation systems, and natural language processing applications.

PGvector is not a vector database, but rather an extension that provides a data type and functions to store and manipulate vector data in Postgres. It is used by the AI Accelerator Pipelines extension, which provides a set of functions to run AI/ML models in the database.

## Installation

The extension is included with AI Accelerator's Pipelines and installed automatically when Pipelines is installed.

## Further information

For more information on the PGvector extension, see the [PGvector repository](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector).
