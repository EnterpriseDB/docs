## What is PGvector

PGvector is an extension for Postgres that enables efficient storage and similarity search of high-dimensional vector data, commonly used for machine learning models, recommendation systems, and natural language processing applications.

### Part of the EDB Postgres AI platform

EDB Postgres AI with PGvector delivers a flexible solution for enterprise AI, integrating seamlessly with existing Postgres environments. It outperforms standalone vector databases with 4.22X faster queries and eliminates data silos via integrations with 18X cost-efficient object storage. This unified platform accelerates AI deployment, simplifies management, and ensures up to 99.999% availability, enabling businesses to innovate rapidly and future-proof their data infrastructure without disrupting current operations.

### Native Vector Data Type Support

PGvector on EDB Postgres AI enables storage of AI/ML model embeddings as first-class data types, allowing efficient indexing and querying of large volumes of AI data stored in object storage, seamlessly integrated with traditional relational data.

### Advanced 4.22X Vector Query

Extends standard SQL with vector-specific operators and functions, enabling complex queries that combine vector operations, relational data, and full SQL capabilities, going far beyond simple similarity searches to support sophisticated AI-driven applications.

### High-performance Indexing 

With real-time indexing, storage, and querying of AI data, PGvector enables efficient vector similarity search on embeddings from various LLMs, while leveraging Postgres transactionality for consistent handling of mixed workloads.

### Integrated Vector Data Platform

PGvector unifies vector database capabilities with EDB Postgres AI's mature enterprise features, ensuring high availability, robust backup/recovery, strong security, and ACID data integrity, all within a single vendor solution for comprehensive data management and AI workloads.

## Installation

The extension is included with AI Accelerator's Pipelines and installed automatically when Pipelines is installed.
