## What is PGvector?

PGvector is an extension for Postgres that enables efficient storage and similarity search of high-dimensional vector data. This type of data is commonly used for machine-learning models, recommendation systems, and natural-language processing applications.

PGvector isn't a vector database but an extension that provides a data type and functions to store and manipulate vector data in Postgres. It's used by the AI Accelerator Pipelines extension, which provides a set of functions to run AI/ML models in the database.

## Installation

The extension is included with AI Accelerator Pipelines and installed as part of the Pipelines installation.
