Preparers are used to perform common preprocessing steps on source data from either a table or volume source. The processed data is stored in a destination table and can be used by other preparers or by retrievers for embedding generation.

## Concepts

### Data preparation operation

The data preparation operation is how the preparer will transform the source data. The supported operations are encoded as variants of the [`aidb.DataPreparationOperation`](../reference/preparers#aidbdatapreparationoperation) enum.

!!! Note
Each operation has its own set of parameters that are used to customize the operation. Learn more in [Primitives](./primitives).

### Data sources

A data source is the input data for the data preparation operation. The aidb extension supports two types of data sources for preparers:

* Table: a column in a table in the PG database.
* Volume: a PGFS "volume," which is a wrapper for accessing an S3 object store or local file system.

### Execution

Primitive functions help with testing operations and their configurations on individual inputs with minimal setup. This is useful for quick experimentation before scaling up with a preparer for bulk data preparation.

Bulk data preparation performs a preparer's associated operation for all of the preparer's source data.
