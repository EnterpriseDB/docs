Preparers are used to perform common pre-processing steps on source data from either a Table or Volume source. The processed data is stored in a destination table and can be used by other Preparers, or by Retrievers for embedding generation.

## Concepts

### Data preparation operation

The data preparation operation is what how the Preparer will transform the source data. The supported operations are encoded as variants of the [`aidb.DataPreparationOperation`](../reference/preparers#aidbdatapreparationoperation) enum.

!!! Note
Each operation has its own set of parameters that are used to customize the operation. Learn more in the [primitives](./primitives) section.
!!!

### Data sources

A data source is the input data for the data preparation operation. The aidb extension supports two types of data sources for preparers:

* Table: a column in a table in the PG database.
* Volume: a PGFS "volume" which is a wrapper for accessing an S3 object store or local file system.

### Execution

Primitive functions facilitate the testing of operations and their configurations on individual inputs with minimal setup. This is useful for quick experimentation before scaling up with a Preparer for bulk data preparation.

Bulk data preparation performs a Preparer's associated operation for all of the Preparer's source data.
