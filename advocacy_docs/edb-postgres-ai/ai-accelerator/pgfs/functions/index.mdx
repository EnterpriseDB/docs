## Creating a storage location

Start with creating a storage location. A storage location is a reference to a location in an external file system. You can create a storage location with the `pgfs.create_storage_location` function:

```sql
select pgfs.create_storage_location('storage_location_name', 'protocol://path', options => '{}'::JSONB, credentials => '{}'::JSONB);
```

### Storage provider types
Detailed instructions for the supported storage providers can be found here:

- [S3-compatible storage](s3)
- [Local file system](local)

### Creating a storage location with options and credentials

Using the `options` and `credentials` parameters allows a range of settings to be passed.

The `options` parameter is a JSON object that can be used to pass additional options to the storage location.
The `credentials` parameter is a JSON object that can be used to pass credentials to the storage location.

The difference between `options` and `credentials` is that options remain visible to users querying the extension while credentials are hidden to all users except superusers and the user that creates the storage location.

### Testing storage locations and using them with AIDB
To use a storage location with aidb, you need to create a volume from the storage location. To do that, see [Creating a volume](../../volumes).

## Listing storage locations

You can list all storage locations with the `pgfs.list_storage_locations` function:

```sql
select * from pgfs.list_storage_locations();
```

This command returns a table of currently defined storage locations. Credentials are shown only if the user has the necessary permissions. Otherwise the column is NULL.

## Getting a storage location

You can get the details of a specific storage location with the `pgfs.get_storage_location` function:

```sql
select * from pgfs.get_storage_location('my_storage');
```

This command returns the details of the storage location named `my_storage`.

## Updating a storage location

You can update a storage location with the `pgfs.update_storage_location` function:

```sql
select pgfs.update_storage_location('my_storage', 's3://my_bucket', null, '{"region": "eu-west"}'
```

## Deleting a storage location

You can delete a storage location with the `pgfs.delete_storage_location` function:

```sql
select pgfs.delete_storage_location('my_storage');
```

This command removes the storage location named `my_storage` from the database.
