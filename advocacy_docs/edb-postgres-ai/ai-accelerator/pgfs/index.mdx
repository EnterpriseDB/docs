Pipelines has a "Postgres File System" (PGFS) extension that allows you to access external storage. In particular, it allows you to store and retrieve files from either a public or private S3-compatible bucket or a local file system. The aidb extension addresses external storage mapped through pgfs as "storage locations" and abstracts away the details of the underlying storage.

PGFS is a key component of Pipelines, allowing you to work with data which is not stored in the database, either because it is too large or because it is not structured in a way that is suitable for a relational database.

PGFS is implemented as a foreign data wrapper (FDW) and is installed as an extension. The extension provides a set of functions to interact with the file system from within the database.

## Installing the PGFS extension

See [Installing](../installing) for instructions on how to install the PGFS extension as part of the Pipelines installation.

## Using PGFS

There are two approaches to using PGFS. 

* (Recommended) Use the [PGFS functions](functions) to create and delete storage locations

* Use SQL commands such as `CREATE SERVER` command to create a server object that creates the storage location.

### Using the PGFS functions

See the [PGFS functions](functions) reference for details on the functions available in the PGFS extension.

## Using PGFS with SQL

See the [PGFS SQL](sql) reference for details on how to use PGFS with SQL commands.
