!!! Note
    This feature is available in EDB Postgres AI - AI Accelerator Pipelines. We recommend you
    use the functionality of the [pgfs functions](../functions) to configure a storage location.

 ## Using PGFS with SQL

### Using the `CREATE SERVER` command

You can also use the `CREATE SERVER` command to create a server object that connects to the storage location. You can then create a foreign table that is associated with the server.

Here is an example of creating a server object that connects to an S3-compatible bucket:

```sql
CREATE SERVER my_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER pgfs OPTIONS (url 's3://my_bucket');
```

### Options and Credentials

There are various options and credentials that you can pass to the storage locations.
The options and credentials are specific to the type of storage location you are using.

- [S3-compatible storage](s3)
- [Local file system](local)
