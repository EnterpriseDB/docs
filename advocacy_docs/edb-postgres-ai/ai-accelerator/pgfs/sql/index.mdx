!!! Note
    This feature is available in EDB Postgres AI - AI Accelerator Pipelines. We recommend that you
    use the [PGFS functions](../functions) to configure a storage location.

## Using PGFS with SQL

### Using the `CREATE SERVER` command

You can use the `CREATE SERVER` command to create a server object that connects to the storage location. You can then create a foreign table that's associated with the server.

This example creates a server object that connects to an S3-compatible bucket:

```sql
CREATE SERVER my_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER pgfs OPTIONS (url 's3://my_bucket');
```

### Options and credentials

You can pass options and credentials to the storage locations.
The options and credentials are specific to the type of storage location you're using.

- [S3-compatible storage](s3)
- [Local file system](local)
