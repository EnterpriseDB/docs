!!! Note
    This feature is available in EDB Postgres AI - AI Accelerator Pipelines. We recommend that you
    use the [PGFS functions](../functions) to configure a storage location.

PGFS uses the `s3:` prefix to indicate an S3-compatible storage system. You can use the `s3:` prefix to access files on an S3-compatible storage system.

## Using S3-compatible storage through PGFS with SQL

This example uses S3-compatible storage:

```sql
CREATE SERVER images_s3 FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER pgfs OPTIONS (url 's3://my-bucket', , skip_signature 'true');
```

This command creates a server object called `images_s3` that connects to the S3-compatible storage system at `my-bucket`. With no credentials provided, the server assumes the S3 storage system is open to the public. For a public bucket, ensure that you include the `skip_signature` option and set it to `true`.

You can then create a foreign table that's associated with the server:

```sql
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE images (id INT, name TEXT) SERVER images_s3;
```

This foreign table is associated with the `images_s3` server object and can be used to access the files in the `my-bucket` directory.

You can also use the `s3:` prefix to access files on the S3-compatible storage system when you create a foreign table. For example:

```sql
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE images (id INT, name TEXT) SERVER images_s3 OPTIONS (filename 's3://my-bucket/image1.jpg');
```

This foreign table is associated with the `images_s3` server object and can be used to access the file `my-bucket/image1.jpg`.

## Supported options with S3-compatible storage

The following options are supported when you create a storage location with S3-compatible storage.

| Option          | Description                                                                 |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `skip_signature` | Skip the signature when connecting to the S3-compatible storage system.     |
| `region`        | The region of the S3-compatible storage system.                             |
| `endpoint`      | The endpoint of the S3-compatible storage system.                           |
| `credentials`   | The credentials for the S3-compatible storage system.                       |
