!!! Note
    This feature is available in EDB Postgres AI - AI Accelerator Pipelines. We recommend that you
    use the [PGFS functions](../functions) to configure a storage location.

PGFS uses the `file:` prefix to indicate a local file system. You can use the `file:` prefix to access files on the local file system.

## Using local file storage through PGFS and SQL

This example uses local file storage:

```sql
CREATE SERVER images_local FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER pgfs OPTIONS (url 'file:///var/lib/edb/pipelines/images');
```

This command creates a server object called `images_local` that connects to the local file system at `/var/lib/edb/pipelines/images`.

You can then create a foreign table that's associated with the server:

```sql
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE images (id INT, name TEXT) SERVER images_local;
```

This foreign table is associated with the `images_local` server object and can be used to access the files in the `/var/lib/edb/pipelines/images` directory.

You can also use the `file:` prefix to access files on the local file system when you create a foreign table. For example:

```sql
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE images (id INT, name TEXT) SERVER images_local OPTIONS (filename 'file:///var/lib/edb/pipelines/images/image1.jpg');
```

This foreign table is associated with the `images_local` server object and can be used to access the file `/var/lib/edb/pipelines/images/image1.jpg`.
