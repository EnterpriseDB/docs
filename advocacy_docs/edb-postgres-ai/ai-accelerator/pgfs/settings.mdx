## About PGFS settings

The PGFS extension has a settings which control how the extension is able to access data. These settings are GUCs (Grand Unified Configuration) which can be set using the Postgres `SET` command.

## PGFS settings

### `pgfs.allowed_local_fs_paths`

By default, PGFS is only able to access files in `/tmp/pgfs` in the local filesystem. This is a security measure to prevent the extension from accessing files it shouldn't.

If you want to allow PGFS to access files in other locations, you need to add those locations to a GUC setting, `pgfs.allowed_local_fs_paths`. This is a colon-separated list of paths that PGFS is allowed to access.

| `pgfs.allowed_local_fs_paths` value | Description                                                              |
|:------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `'/tmp/pgfs'`                       | The default location for PGFS to access files.                           |
| `'/tmp/pgfs:/tmp/other'`            | PGFS is able to access files in both `/tmp/pgfs` and `/tmp/other`.       |
| `'/'`                               | PGFS is able to access all files on the system. This is not recommended. |
| `''`                                | PGFS is not able to access any local files.                              |

Use the Postgres `SET` command to change the setting. For example, to allow PGFS to access files in `/tmp/pgfs` and `/tmp/other`, you would run:

```sql
SET pgfs.allowed_local_fs_paths = '/tmp/pgfs:/tmp/other';
```
