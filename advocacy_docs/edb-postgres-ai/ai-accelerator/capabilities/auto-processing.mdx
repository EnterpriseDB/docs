## Overview
Pipeline Auto-Processing is designed to keep source data and pipeline output in sync. Without this capability, users would have to
manually trigger processing or provide external scripts, schedulers or triggers:
- **Full sync:** Insert/delete/update are all handled automatically. No lost updates, missing data or stale records.
- **Change detection:** Only new or changed records are processed. No unnecessary re-processing of known records.
- **Batch processing:** Records are grouped into batches to be processed concurrently. Reducing overhead and achieving optimal performance e.g. with GPU-based AI model inference tasks.
- **Background processing:** When enabled, the pipeline runs in a background worker process so that it doesn't block or delay other DB operations. Ideal for processing huge datasets.
- **Live processing for Postgres tables:** When the data source is a Postgres table, live trigger-based auto processing can be enabled so that pipeline results are always guaranteed up to date.
- **Quick turnaround:** Once a batch has finished processing, the results are immediately available. No full listing of the source data is needed to start processing. This is important for large external volumes where a full listing can take a long time.

### Example for Knowledge Base Pipeline
A knowledge base is created for a Postgres table containing products with product descriptions.
The user configures background auto-processing to always keep embeddings in sync without blocking or delaying any operations on the products table.

The pipeline will process any pre-existing product records in the background, the user can query the statistics table to see the progress.

The background process will run when new data is inserted, existing data modified or deleted.

Queries on the Knowledge Base (i.e. retrieval operations) will always return accurate results within a small background processing delay.


### Supported pipelines
The Knowledge Base pipeline supports all capabilities listed here.

The Preparer pipeline does not yet support batch processing and background auto-processing

## Auto-Processing modes
We offer the following Auto-Processing modes to suit different requirements and use-cases.

!!! Note
Live auto-processing is only available for table sources. Not for volume sources.
!!!

### Live
We set up Postgres Triggers on the source table to immediately process any changes. Processing happens within the trigger function.
This means it happens within the same transaction that modifies the data, guaranteeing up to date results.

#### Considerations
- Transactional guarantee / immediate results. Pipeline results are always up to date with the source data.
- Blocks / delays operations on the source data. Modifying transactions on the source data are delayed until processing is complete.

### Background
We start a Postgres background worker for each pipeline TODO


!!! Note
Make sure Postgres allows running enough background workers for the number of pipelines where you wish to use this processing mode.

### Disabled

## Observability
We provide detailed status and progress output for all auto-processing modes.

A good place to get an overview is the statistics table.
Look up the view `aidb.knowledge_base_stats` or use its short alias `aidb.kbstat`. The table shows all configured knowledge base pipelines,
which processing mode is set, and statistics about the processed records:
```sql
SELECT * from aidb.kbstat;

The [change detection](#change-detection) mechanism is central to how auto-processing works. It is different for volume and table sources.
For this reason, the stats table has different columns for these two source types.

* `table: unprocessed rows`: How many unique rows are listed in the backlog of change events.
  * If auto-processing is disabled, no (new) change events are captured.
* `volume: scans completed`: How many full listings of the source have been completed so far.
* `count(source records)`: How many records exist in the source for this pipeline.
  * for table sources, this number is always accurate.
  * for volume sources, we can only update this number after a full scan has completed.
* `count(embeddings)`: How many embeddings exist in the vector destination table for this pipeline.



## Configuration
Auto-processing can be configured at creation time:
- With [`aidb.create_table_knowledge_base`](../reference/knowledge_bases#aidbcreate_table_knowledge_base)
- With [`aidb.create_volume_knowledge_base`](../reference/knowledge_bases#aidbcreate_volume_knowledge_base)

As well as for existing pipelines:
- With [`aidb.set_auto_knowledge_base`](../reference/knowledge_bases#aidbset_auto_knowledge_base)

## Batch processing
In Background and Disabled modes, (auto) processing happens in batches of configurable size. Within each batch,

## Change detection
AIDB auto-processing is designed around change detection mechanisms for table and volume data sources. This allows it to only
process data when necessary.

### Table sources
When background auto-processing is configured, Postgres triggers are set up on the source table to detect changes. These triggers are very lightweight.
They only record change events and insert them into a "change events" table. No actual processing happens in the trigger function.

The background worker will then process these events asynchronously.

!!! Notice
When auto-processing is disabled, no change detection on tables is possible. This means the manual `bulk_embedding()` operation has to process
all source records.
!!!


### Volume sources
This source type provides a `last_modified` timestamp for each source record. The system keeps track of those timestamps in a "state" table.
In each pipeline execution, the system lists the contents of the volume and compares it to the timestamps to see whether any records have changed or were added.

This mechanism works in disabled and in background auto-processing.

The system detects deleted objects after a full listing is complete. Only then can it be certain that a previously processed record is no longer present in the source.

Unfortunately, object stores (and other external storage locations supported by our volumes) have limited query capabilities. This means:
!!! Note
Change detection for volumes is based on polling i.e., repeated listing. This might be an expensive operation when using cloud object stores like AWS S3.
You can use a long `background_sync_interval` (like one per day) on pipelines with volume sources to control this cost.
