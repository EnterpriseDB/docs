### Installing the AI Database extension

The AI Database extension is an extension that provides a set of functions to run AI/ML models in the database. The extension is installed using the `CREATE EXTENSION` command.

```sql
ebd=# CREATE EXTENSION aidb CASCADE;
NOTICE:  installing required extension "vector"
CREATE EXTENSION
edb=#
```

### Installing the File System extension

The File System extension is an extension that provides a set of functions to interact with the file system from within the database. The extension is installed using the `CREATE EXTENSION` command.

```sql
edb=# create extension pgfs;
CREATE EXTENSION
```

### Validating the installation

You can check the extensions have been installed by running the `\dx` command in `psql`.

```sql
edb=# \dx
__OUTPUT__
                                     List of installed extensions

------------------+---------+------------+------------------------------------------------------------
 aidb             | 1.0.1   | aidb       | aidb: makes it easy to build AI applications with postgres
 pgfs             | 1.0.2   | pgfs       | pgfs: enables access to filesystem-like storage locations
