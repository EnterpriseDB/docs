Pipelines has a model registry that manages configured instances of models. Any Pipelines functions that use models, such as embedding and retrieving, must reference a registered model.

* Learn how to [register models](./using-models) in Pipelines.
* Discover the [primitives](./primitives) that can be used to interact with models.
* See the [supported models](./supported-models) that come with Pipelines.

## Next Steps

Once you are familiar with Models, move on to learn how to use those models with [Retrievers](../retrievers).
