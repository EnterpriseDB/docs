Pipelines has a "Postgres File System" (PGFS) that allows you access external storage. In particular, it allows you to store and retrieve files from either a public or private S3-compatible bucket or a local file system.

PGFS is a key component of Pipelines, allowing you to work with data which is not stored in the database, either because it is too large or because it is not structured in a way that is suitable for a relational database.

pgfs is implemented as a foreign data wrapper (FDW) and is installed as an extension. The extension provides a set of functions to interact with the file system from within the database.

## Installing the PGFS extension

See [Installing](../installing) for instructions on how to install the PGFS extension as part of the Pipelines installation.

## Using PGFS

Depending on where the data is stored, you will need to create a server object to connect to the storage location. The server object is created using the `CREATE SERVER` command.
