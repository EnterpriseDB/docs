<table class="table w-100"><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th width="10%">Addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><details><summary>Renamed retrievers to knowledge bases and renamed preparer functions.</summary><hr/><p>The retriever pipeline has been renamed to the knowledge base pipeline.</p>
<p>The functions <code>aidb.create_retriever_for_table()</code> and <code>aidb.create_retriever_for_volume()</code> have been renamed to <code>aidb.create_knowledge_base_for_table()</code> and <code>aidb.create_knowledge_base_for_volume()</code>, respectively.</p>
<p>Also renamed is the <code>aidb.delete_retriever</code> function (to <code>aidb.delete_knowledge_base()</code>) and the <code>aidb.RetrieverSourceDataFormat</code> enum has been renamed to <code>aidb.PipelineDataFormat</code>.</p>
<p>For consistency, the preparer pipeline functions have also been renamed. The <code>aidb.create_preparer_for_table()</code> function has been renamed to <code>aidb.create_table_preparer()</code> and <code>aidb.create_preparer_for_volume()</code> has been renamed to <code>aidb.create_volume_preparer()</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>aidb.retrievers</code> view is now the <code>aidb.knowledge_bases</code> view. Aliases for the <code>aidb.knowledge_bases</code> and <code>aidb.preparers</code> views have also been added as <code>aidb.kbs</code> and <code>aidb.preps</code> respectively.</p>
<p>The older functions and view names are still available but marked as deprecated. They will be removed in a future release.</p>

<tr><td><details><summary>The aidb.rerank_text() function now returns results as a rich table</summary><hr/><p>The <code>aidb.rerank_text()</code> function used to rerank a list of texts based on a ranking query, now returns its results in a table, one row per text. The table includes columns for the raw logit_score, the text itself and the index from the input.
This makes it much easier to use the result in larger SQL query e.g. by joining with other data or sorting the rows by logit_score.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Improved debugging capabilities for AI models accessed over HTTP APIs</summary><hr/><p>AIDB now prints rich debugging output for any errors encountered when using external models via API. This includes NIM models and OpenAI API compatible models.
The HTTP status code, error response content, and request content are logged to help users debug issues like incorrect endpoints, incorrect model configuration or incorrect credentials, among others.</p>
