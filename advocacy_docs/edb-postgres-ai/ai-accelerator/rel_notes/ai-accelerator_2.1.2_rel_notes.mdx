Released: 21 February 2025

In this maintenance release, we fix two bugs and improve the model provider listing output.

## Highlights

- Model provider output now contains descriptions of the providers.

## Enhancements

<table class="table w-100"><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th width="10%">Addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><details><summary>Added model provider descriptions</summary><hr/><p>The model provider view <code>select * from aidb.model_providers;</code> now includes a description column detailing the purpose and capabilities of each model provider.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Fixed the volume listing command</summary><hr/><p>The <code>aidb.list_volumes();</code> call is now functional. A bug prevented this call from succeeding (without affecting any other functionality).</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Fixed the search path handling</summary><hr/><p>Some internal commands used to append <code>aidb</code> to the search_path. This failed in certain cases depending on the contents of the existing search path. We changed the implementation to no longer modify the search_path in order to avoid this issue. This also means that the existing search_path no longer gets modified by AIDB.</p>
