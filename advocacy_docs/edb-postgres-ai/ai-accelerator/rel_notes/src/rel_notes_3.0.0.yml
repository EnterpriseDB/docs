version: 3.0.0

intro: |
  In this release, we're adding auto-processing support to the new Preparer Pipeline and make a breaking change to the return type of two batch processing functions.

  As always, we also include enhancements to existing functionality. 
highlights: |
 - The new Data Preparation Pipeline now supports Live auto processing when the data source is a table.

- relnote: Model encode/decode batch functions now return rows instead of an array of results.
  details: |
    The two functions `aidb.decode_text_batch()` and `aidb.encode_text_batch()` now return a set of rows as their result, instead of a single row containing an array. 
    This change was made based on customer feedback. In the case of the encode function, the return type is a list of vector embeddings. These are arrays themselves (arrays of floating point numbers). 
    By returning this set of vectors as an array, we end up with a two-dimensional array. These kinds of arrays are not well supported in Postgres and get flattened in the return type of the function.
    Complicated parseing of the flattened array was required to work with the return type.
    This was less of an issue with the decode function but we decided to change both to retain consistency in the return types.
    Now, the batch functions return a set of rows, one row for each input value.
