relnotes:
 - relnote: Change the tracking of "run IDs" for volume knowledge bases from a PG sequence to a PG table column
   details: |
     Knowledge bases with volume source need to assign an incrementing ID to each listing done on the source.
     This is necessary to detect when a listing is complete and recognize which previously seen objects were not encountered any more.
     In this release the method for tracking run IDs is changed to a table column since the Postgres sequence used before did not
     work on Postgres Distributed (PGD) clusters.
