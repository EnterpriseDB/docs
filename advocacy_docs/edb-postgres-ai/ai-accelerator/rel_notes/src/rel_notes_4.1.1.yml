product: AI Accelerator - Pipelines
version: 4.1.1
date: 28 May 2025
intro: |
  This is a minor release that includes bug fixes.
  Note: this release depends on the new PGFS version 2.0.2. If you're using PGFS together with AIDB, please update PGFS as well.
highlights: |
  - Bug fixes and UX enhancements.
relnotes:
 - relnote: Change the tracking of "run IDs" for volume knowledge bases from a PG sequence to a PG table column
   details: |
     Knowledge bases with volume source need to assign an incrementing ID to each listing done on the source.
     This is necessary to detect when a listing is complete and recognize which previously seen objects were not encountered any more.
     In this release the method for tracking run IDs is changed to a table column since the Postgres sequence used before did not
     work on Postgres Distributed (PGD) clusters.

 - relnote: Support AIDB volumes in arbitrary Postgres schemas
   details: |
     Volumes for AIDB can be created in arbitrary schemas in Postgres either by exlicitly passing a schema to the create function, or by
     setting a "current schema" via the search path. When using volumes in AIDB pipelines, the volume reference needs to be stored.
     AIDB will now store and explicitly use a schema when later executing a pipeline. Previously, the search path was used to find volumes.

 - relnote: Background worker dispatcher is no longer persistent
   details: |
     When background workers are enabled for AIDB, a root-worker will start a database dispatcher for each database within the Postgres instance.
     This database dispatcher checks if AIDB is installed in the DB and if any pipelines need to be run in the background.
     The database dispatcher is now no longer a permanent process by default. When a database does not use AIDB, the database dispatcher
     exits and will be re-started to check for AIDB every 2 minutes.
     This avoids holding a permanent connection to the DB that would block e.g. "drop table" commands.
     If AIDB is installed in the DB, then the database dispatcher worker will keep running. Users can drop the extension in order to release the connection.
