product: AI Accelerator - Pipelines
version: 4.0.1
date: 9 May 2025
intro: |
  This is a minor release that includes a few bug fixes and enhancements to the knowledge base pipeline.
highlights: |
   - Bug fixes and performance enhancements.
   - Simplified model integration for HCP.
relnotes:
- relnote: Bug fixes for knowledge base and preparer pipeline schema handling.
  details: |
    The knowledge base and preparer pipeline now support arbitrary Postgres schemas for source and destination tables/volumes.
    A bug prevented users for configuring explicit schemas via Postgres qualified identifiers (`schema.name`) when referencing source or destination tables/volumes in the create pipeline calls. This bug is now fixed.

- relnote: Simplified model integration for HCP.
  details: |
    External models, running on the HCP Model Serving infrastruction, can now be listed and integrated into AIDB with new helper functions `aidb.get_hcp_models()` and `aidb.create_hcp_model()`.

- relnote: Performance enhancement for embeddings processing with external models.
  details: |
    When using external models for embeddings (e.g. with the nim_embeddings model adapter), AIDB performs additional API calls in order to probe the model service for the response type.
    These calls are now skipped in most situation to reduce the overhead to a minimum when running embedding processing. AIDB will now use actual results to determine the response type.
