  details: |
    The retriever pipeline has been renamed to the knowledge base pipeline. 
    
    The functions `aidb.create_retriever_for_table()` and `aidb.create_retriever_for_volume()` have been renamed to `aidb.create_knowledge_base_for_table()` and `aidb.create_knowledge_base_for_volume()`, respectively. 
    
    Also renamed is the `aidb.delete_retriever` function (to `aidb.delete_knowledge_base()`) and the `aidb.RetrieverSourceDataFormat` enum has been renamed to `aidb.PipelineDataFormat`.

    For consistency, the preparer pipeline functions have also been renamed. The `aidb.create_preparer_for_table()` function has been renamed to `aidb.create_table_preparer()` and `aidb.create_preparer_for_volume()` has been renamed to `aidb.create_volume_preparer()`.
    
    The `aidb.retrivers` view is now the `aidb.knowledge_bases` view.Aliases for the `aidb.knowledge_bases` and `aidb.preparers` views have also been added as `aidb.kbs` and `aidb.preps` respectively. 
    
    The older functions and view names are still available but marked as deprecated. They will be removed in a future release.
