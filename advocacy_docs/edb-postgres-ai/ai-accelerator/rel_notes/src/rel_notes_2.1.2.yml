- relnote: Fixed the volume listing command
  details: |
    The `aidb.list_volumes();` call is now functional. A bug prevented this call from succeeding (without affecting any other functionality).

  type: Bug Fix
  impact: High
- relnote: Fixed the search path handling
  details: |
    Some internal commands used to append `aidb` to the search_path. This failed in certain cases depending on the contents of the existing search path. We changed the implementation to no longer modify the search_path in order to avoid this issue. This also means that the existing search_path no longer gets modified by AIDB.

  type: Bug Fix
  impact: High
- relnote: Credentials are now completely optional for OpenAI compatible models
  details: |
    Previously the `aidb.create_model()` function required a key with an empty value to be passed for the api-key. It now allows you to omit the `credentials` parameter.
