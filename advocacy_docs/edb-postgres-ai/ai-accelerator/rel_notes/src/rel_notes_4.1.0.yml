- relnote: Automatic unnesting of Preparer results for operations that transform the shape of data.
  details: |
    The preparer pipeline for operations that transform the shape of their input data with an additional dimension now unnest their result collections.
    This allows the output of preparers to be consumed much more easily by other preparers or knowledge bases.
    Unnested results are returned with a new `part_id` column to track the new dimension. There is also a new `unique_id` column to unqiuely identify the combination of the source key and part_id.
