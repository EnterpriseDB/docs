- relnote: Adds handler for the FDW (foreign data wrappers) used for the model registry

    The handler has no functionality but it satisfied the FDW handler interface. This avoids certain issues with PG system calls that happen when FDWs don't have any handlers.

- relnote: Adds schema support / fully qualified identifiers to the retriever pipeline.
  details: |
     For retrievers with table sources, the source table and vector table can now be in any schema in the PG database. The schema can either be passed during retriever creation (fully qualified identifier) or can be omitted. If the schema is omitted, we resolve and store the applicable schema.
