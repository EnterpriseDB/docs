<tr><td><details><summary>Change the tracking of &quot;run IDs&quot; for volume knowledge bases from a PG sequence to a PG table column</summary><hr/><p>Knowledge bases with volume source need to assign an incrementing ID to each listing done on the source.
This is necessary to detect when a listing is complete and recognize which previously seen objects were not encountered any more.
In this release the method for tracking run IDs is changed to a table column since the Postgres sequence used before did not
work on Postgres Distributed (PGD) clusters.</p>
