### Installing the AI Database extension

The AI Database extension is an extension that provides a set of functions to run AI/ML models in the database. The extension is installed using the `CREATE EXTENSION` command.

```sql
ebd=# CREATE EXTENSION aidb CASCADE;
NOTICE:  installing required extension "vector"
CREATE EXTENSION
edb=#
```

#### Proxy settings

If you are using a HTTP proxy, you may need to set the `HTTP_PROXY` and `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variables in Postgres's environment. You can do this by adding the following lines to the `environment` file in the `main` directory of the Postgres data directory.

For example, on Ubuntu with Community Postgres, the `environment` file is located at `/etc/postgresql/16/main/environment`. Run the following commands to add the proxy settings to the `environment` file and restart the Postgres service.

```bash
echo "HTTP_PROXY = 'http://<yourproxysettings>/'" | sudo tee -a /etc/postgresql/16/main/environment
echo "HTTPS_PROXY = 'http://<yourproxysettings/'"  | sudo tee -a /etc/postgresql/16/main/environment
sudo systemctl restart postgresql@16-main
```

Replace `<yourproxysettings>` with your proxy settings. If you are using a different version of Postgres, replace `16` with your version number. Consult the documentation for your Postgres distribution for the location of the `environment` file.

Airgapped environments are not supported.

### Installing the File System extension

The File System extension is an extension that provides a set of functions to interact with the file system from within the database. The extension is installed using the `CREATE EXTENSION` command.

```sql
edb=# create extension pgfs;
CREATE EXTENSION
```

### Validating the installation

You can check the extensions have been installed by running the `\dx` command in `psql`.

```sql
edb=# \dx
__OUTPUT__
                                     List of installed extensions
       Name       | Version |   Schema   |                        Description
------------------+---------+------------+------------------------------------------------------------
 aidb             | 2.1.1   | aidb       | aidb: makes it easy to build AI applications with postgres
 pgfs             | 1.0.6   | pgfs       | pgfs: enables access to filesystem-like storage locations
 vector           | 0.8.0   | public     | vector data type and ivfflat and hnsw access methods
```

Typically, there will be other extensions listed in this view. The `aidb`, `pgfs`, and `vector` extensions should be listed.
