### Installing the AI Database extension

The AI Database extension provides a set of functions to run AI/ML models in the database. Install the extension using the `CREATE EXTENSION` command:

```sql
ebd=# CREATE EXTENSION aidb CASCADE;
NOTICE:  installing required extension "vector"
CREATE EXTENSION
edb=#
```

### Installing the Postgres File System extension

The Postgres File System (PGFS) extension provides a set of functions to interact with the file system from the database. Install the extension using the `CREATE EXTENSION` command:

```sql
edb=# create extension pgfs;
CREATE EXTENSION
```

### Validating the installation

You can check whether the extensions were installed by running the `\dx` command in psql:

```sql
edb=# \dx
__OUTPUT__

------------------+---------+------------+------------------------------------------------------------
 aidb             | 2.1.1   | aidb       | aidb: makes it easy to build AI applications with postgres
 pgfs             | 1.0.6   | pgfs       | pgfs: enables access to filesystem-like storage locations
 vector           | 0.8.0   | public     | vector data type and ivfflat and hnsw access methods
