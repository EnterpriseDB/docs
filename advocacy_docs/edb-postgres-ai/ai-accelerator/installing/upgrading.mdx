Currently Piplelines does not support in-place upgrading with the ALTER EXTENSION command. To upgrade to a new version, you must first uninstall the existing version and then install the new version.

## To upgrade Pipelines, follow these steps:
!!!Note
This will not delete any managed data. It will just ensure that no dangling references (e.g. Triggers) remain while AIDB is uninstalled, and allows you to do a clean setup after upgrading.
!!!

### 1. Delete all configured Pipelines
Get a list of all the Retriever and Preparer Pipelines you have configured: `SELECT name FROM aidb.retrievers;` and `SELECT name FROM aidb.preparers;`. Then delete all Retrievers and Preparer by calling `SELECT aidb.delete_retriever('name');` and `SELECT aidb.delete_preparer('retriever__5887');`.

You can use this SQL code to do both in one operation:
```sql
WITH names AS (SELECT name FROM aidb.retrievers)
  SELECT aidb.delete_retriever(name) FROM names;


WITH names AS (SELECT name FROM aidb.preparers)
  SELECT aidb.delete_preparer(name) FROM names;
```

### 2. Uninstall the old version of the extension
```sql
ebd=# DROP EXTENSION aidb CASCADE;
DROP EXTENSION
edb=#
```

### 3. Install the new version of the extension in your environment
Follow the same steps you took to install the old version: [Manually installing pipelines packages](packages).

### 4. Create the extension in your Postgres Database
```sql
ebd=# CREATE EXTENSION aidb CASCADE;
NOTICE:  installing required extension "vector"
CREATE EXTENSION
edb=#
```

### 5. Re-create the Pipelines you want to use
Run the same commands you originally ran to create the Pipelines.
