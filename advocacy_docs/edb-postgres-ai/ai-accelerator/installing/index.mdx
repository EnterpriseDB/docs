Pipelines is delivered as a set of extensions. Depending on how you're deploying Pipelines, these extensions can be installed by your deployment platform (such as EDB Cloud Service). If you deploy your own Postgres server, you need to install them manually.

- [Manually installing pipelines packages](packages)

Once the packages are installed, you can [complete the installation](complete) by activating the extensions in Postgres.
