## Installing the extension packages

There are three extension packages that are required to use the AI Accelerator Pipelines:

- `aidb` - The AI Database extension
- `pgfs` - The PGFS (Postgres File System) extension
- `vector` - The PGvector extension

### Prerequisite

This guide assumes you have a PostgreSQL server running. You can install AI Accelerator Pipelines on a Community PostgreSQL server, an EDB Postgres Advanced Server, or an EDB Postgres Extended server. Consult the installation guides for those products if you need help setting up a server. When you install the server, make a note of the package name used as it will be needed to install the AI Accelerator Pipelines packages.

- For Community PostgreSQL, the package name is `postgresql-<version>`.
- For EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the package name is `edb-as<version>` followed by `-server`.
- For EDB Postgres Extended, the package name is `edb-postgresextended-<version>` followed by `-server`.

Once you have established the package name, you can install the server using the package manager for your operating system.

### Installing the packages

Once the server is running, there will be a number of packages that need to be installed. The packages are available in the EDB repository, and can be installed using the appropriate package manager for your operating system. You will need to use either:

- `apt` for Debian/Ubuntu based systems with .deb packages
- `dnf` for Red Hat based systems with .rpm packages

Depending on your operating system. The packages are:

#### For Community PostgreSQL

- `edb-pg<version>-aidb` - The AI Database extension
- `edb-pg<version>-pgfs` - The File System extension

and for the Vector extension either:

- rpm-based systems: `edb-pg<version>-pgvector0`
- deb-based systems: `edb-pg<version>-pgvector-0`

#### For EDB Postgres Advanced Server

- `edb-as<version>-aidb` - The AI Database extension
- `edb-as<version>-pgfs` - The File System extension

and for the Vector extension either:

- rpm-based systems: `edb-as<version>-pgvector0`
- deb-based systems: `edb-as<version>-pgvector-0`

#### For EDB Postgres Extended

- `edb-pgextended-<version>-aidb` - The AI Database extension
- `edb-pgextended-<version>-pgfs` - The File System extension

and for the Vector extension either:

- rpm-based systems: `edb-postgresextended<version>-pgvector0`
- deb-based systems: `edb-postgresextended<version>-pgvector-0`


!!! Note Example
Installing the packages on Ubuntu 22.04, with EDB Postgres Advanced Server 16 would look like this:

```shell
sudo apt-get install edb-as16-aidb edb-as16-pgfs edb-as16-pgvector-0
```

With the packages installed, you can now connect to the database and [complete the installation the extensions in Postgres](complete).
