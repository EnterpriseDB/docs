Pipelines has a model registry that manages configured instances of models. Any Pipelines functions that use models, such as embedding and retrieving, must reference a model in this registry. 

## Discover the preloaded models

Pipelines comes with a set of pre-created models that you can use out of the box. 

To find them, you can run the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM aidb.list_models();
```

This will return a list of all the models that are currently created in the system. If you have not created any models, you'll see the default models that come with Pipelines.

```text
         name          |     provider      |              options
-----------------------+-------------------+-----------------------------------
 bert                  | bert_local        | {"config={}"}
 clip                  | clip_local        | {"config={}"}
 t5                    | t5_local          | {"config={}"}
 dummy                 | dummy             | {"config={}"}
```

The `bert`, `clip`, and `t5` models are all pre-created and ready to use. The `dummy` model is a placeholder model that can be used for testing purposes.

## Creating a Model

You can also create your own models. To do this, you can use the `aidb.create_model` function. Here is an example of how to create a model:

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model('my_model', 'bert_local');
```

This will create a model named `my_model` that uses the default `bert_local` model provider. But, this is essentially the same as using the bert model thats already created.

## Discovering the Model Providers

You can also find out what model providers are available by running the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM aidb.model_providers;
__OUTPUT__
    server_name     | server_options
--------------------+----------------
 t5_local           |
 openai_embeddings  |
 openai_completions |
 bert_local         |
 clip_local         |
 dummy              |
```

This will return a list of all the model providers that are currently available in the system. You can find out more about these providers and their capabilities in the [Supported Models](./supported-models) section.

## Creating a Model with a Configuration

You can also pass options to the model when creating it. For example, you can specify the model configuration:

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model('my_model', 
                            'bert_local', 
                            '{"model": "sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2",
                             "revision": "main"}'::JSONB);
```

This will create a model named `my_model` that uses the `bert_local` model provider and the `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` model from HuggingFace. The `revision` option specifies the version of the model to use. The options are passed as a JSONB object, with a single quoted string that is then cast to JSONB. Within the string are the key-value pairs that define the model configuration in a single JSON object.

## Creating a Model with Configuration and Credentials

This is where the other [supported models](./supported-models) come in. You can create a different model by specifying the model name in the configuration. The `OpenAI Completions` and `OpenAI Embeddings` models are both models which you can create to make use of OpenAI's completions and embeddings APIs.

You need to provide more information to the `aidb.create_model` function when creating a model like this. Completions has a number of options, including selecting which model it will use on OpenAI. Both Completions and Embeddings require API credentials. Here is an example of how to create the OpenAI Completions model:

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model(
  'my_openai_model',
  'openai_completions',
  '{"model": "gpt-4o"}'::JSONB,
  '{"api_key": "sk-abc123xyz456def789ghi012jkl345mn"}'::JSONB
  };
```

You should replace the `api_key` value with your own OpenAI API key. Now you can use the `my_openai_model` model in your Pipelines functions and, in this example, leverage the GPT-4o model from OpenAI.

You can also create the OpenAI Embeddings model in a similar way.

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model(
  'my_openai_embeddings',
  'openai_embeddings',
  '{"model": "text-embedding-3-large"}'::JSONB,
  '{"api_key": "sk-abc123xyz456def789ghi012jkl345mn"}'::JSONB
  };
```

This will create the `text-embedding-3-large` model with the name `my_openai_embeddings`. You can now use this model in your Pipelines functions to generate embeddings for text data.

## Using models with OpenAI compatible APIs

These OpenAI models work with any OpenAI compatible API. This allows you to connect and use an even wider range of models, just by passing the appropriate API endpoint to the `url` option in the `aidb.create_model` function's options.

For more information about the OpenAI models, see the [OpenAI Completions](./supported-models/openai-completions) and [OpenAI Embeddings](./supported-models/openai-embeddings) pages.
