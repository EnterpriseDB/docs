Pipelines has a model registry that manages configured instances of models. Any Pipelines functions that use models, such as embedding and retrieving, must reference a model in this registry.

## Discover the preloaded models

Pipelines comes with a set of pre-configured models that you can use out of the box.

To find them, run the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM aidb.models;
```

This query returns a list of all the models that are currently created in the system. If you haven't created any models, you'll see the default models that come with Pipelines.

```text
         name          |     provider      |              options
-----------------------+-------------------+-----------------------------------
 bert                  | bert_local        | {"config={}"}
 clip                  | clip_local        | {"config={}"}
 t5                    | t5_local          | {"config={}"}
 dummy                 | dummy             | {"config={}"}
```

The `bert`, `clip`, and `t5` models are all pre-configured and ready to use. The `dummy` model is a placeholder model that can be used for testing purposes.

!!! note First use of local models
The first time you use any of the local models, the model will be downloaded from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/).  The model is then run locally.
Subsequent uses of the model will be faster, as the model will be cached locally.

If you use a proxy, ensure that it is [configured on the Postgres server](../installing/complete#proxy-settings).

## Creating a model

You can create your own models. To do this, you can use the `aidb.create_model` function. This example shows how to create a model:

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model('my_model', 'bert_local');
```

This command creates a model named `my_model` that uses the default `bert_local` model provider. Because this example doesn't use any additional parameters, `my_model` is the same the `bert_local` model that came preloaded. To configure the model when you create it, see [Creating a model with a configuration](#creating-a-model-with-a-configuration).

## Discovering the model providers

You can find the model providers that are available by running the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM aidb.model_providers;
__OUTPUT__
    server_name     |                                          server_description                                          | server_options

 completions        | For any model that implements the OpenAI completions API.                                            | 
 openai_embeddings  | For any embeddings model on the OpenAI platform                                                      | 
 openai_completions | For any completions model on the OpenAI platform.                                                    | 
 nim_completions    | For any model that implements the OpenAI completions API on NVIDIA NIM.                              | 
 nim_embeddings     | For any model that implements the OpenAI embeddings API on NVIDIA NIM.                               | 
 nim_clip           | Vision/text model, ideal for encoding text and images, runs on NVIDIA NIM.                           | 
 nim_reranking      | Reranking model, runs on NVIDIA NIM.                                                                 | 
 bert_local         | Simple language model, ideal for encoding text, runs locally.                                        | 
 clip_local         | A vision/text model, ideal for encoding text and images, runs locally.                               | 
 dummy              | Provides fake data, ideal for testing.                                                               | 
(12 rows)
```

This query returns a list of all the model providers that are currently available in the system. You can find out more about these providers and their capabilities in [Supported models](./supported-models).

## Creating a model with a configuration

You can pass options to the model when creating it. For example, you can specify the model configuration:

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model('my_model', 
                            'bert_local', 
                            '{"model": "sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2",
                             "revision": "main"}'::JSONB);
```

This command creates a model named `my_model` that uses the `bert_local` model provider and the `sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2` model from HuggingFace. The `revision` option specifies the version of the model to use. The options are passed as a JSONB object, with a single quoted string that's then cast to JSONB. In the string are the key-value pairs that define the model configuration in a single JSON object.

## Creating a model with configuration and credentials

Using a configuration and credentials is where the other [supported models](./supported-models) come in. You can create a different model by specifying the model name in the configuration. The `openai-completions` and `openai-embeddings` models are both models that you can create to make use of OpenAI's completions and embeddings APIs. Similarly, the `nim-completions` and `nim-embeddings` models are models that you can create to make use of NVIDIA's completions and embeddings APIs.

You need to provide more information to the `aidb.create_model` function when creating a model this way. Completions has a number of options, including selecting the model it will use on OpenAI. Both completions and embeddings require API credentials. This example shows how to create the OpenAI completions model:

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model(
  'my_openai_model',
  'openai_completions',
  '{"model": "gpt-4o"}'::JSONB,
  '{"api_key": "sk-abc123xyz456def789ghi012jkl345mn"}'::JSONB
  );
```

Replace the `api_key` value with your own OpenAI API key (Read more about credential handling under [supported models](./supported-models)). Then you can use the `my_openai_model` model in your Pipelines functions and, in this example, leverage the GPT-4o model from OpenAI.

Creating the OpenAI embeddings model is similar to creating the completions model:

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model(
  'my_openai_embeddings',
  'openai_embeddings',
  '{"model": "text-embedding-3-small"}'::JSONB,
  '{"api_key": "sk-abc123xyz456def789ghi012jkl345mn"}'::JSONB
  );
```

This command creates the `text-embedding-3-small` model with the name `my_openai_embeddings`. You can then use this model in your Pipelines functions to generate embeddings for text data.

Where models do use credentials, the credentials set in the first use of `create_model` for the model provider are used with all subsequent uses of that model. You can't use different credentials for different models that use the same provider.

If you need to change the credentials, you can use the `replace_credentials` option when creating a new model. That option updates the credentials for the model provider.

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model(
  'my_new_openai_model',
  'openai_completions',
  '{"model": "gpt-4o"}'::JSONB,
   '{"api_key": "sk-ngl234meh789ski1111bid011i"}'::JSONB,
   replace_credentials => true
  );
```

If you only needed to change the credentials, you can delete the new model using `SELECT aidb.delete_model('my_new_openai_model')`.

## Using models with OpenAI-compatible APIs

The completions and embeddings models work with any OpenAI-compatible API. This compatibility allows you to connect and use an even wider range of models. Pass the appropriate API endpoint to the `url` option in the `aidb.create_model` function's options.

For more information about the models, see [Completions](./supported-models/completions) and [Embeddings](./supported-models/embeddings).
