Pipelines has a model registry that manages configured instances of models. Any Pipelines functions that use models, such as embedding and retrieving, must reference a created model.

* How to [create models](./using-models) in Pipelines.
* Discover the [primitives](./primitives) that can be used to interact with models.
* See the [supported models](./supported-models) that come with Pipelines.
* Using [models with OpenAI API-compatible services and Nvidia NIM](using-with) with Pipelines.

## Next steps

Once you are familiar with models, you can learn how to use those models with [knowledge bases](../knowledge_bases).
