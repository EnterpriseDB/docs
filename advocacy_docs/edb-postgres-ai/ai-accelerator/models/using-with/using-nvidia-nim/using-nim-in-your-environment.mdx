To use a NVIDIA NIM that's hosted in your own environment, you first need an instance of the model. This tutorial shows how to configure an AWS-hosted instance with the NVIDIA NIM model. It uses the NVIDIA NIM model llama3-8b-instruct.

## Prerequisites

* A system capable of running NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit. For this tutorial, we recommend using an **EC2 g5.8xlarge instance** with **1024 GB of gp3 storage** running **Ubuntu 24.04 LTS**, although smaller instance sizes may also work.
* A NVIDIA NGC account. (If you don't have one, you can create one [here](https://build.nvidia.com/explore/discover/).)

## Configuring the system

### 1. Install NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit

Download and install the CUDA Toolkit from [NVIDIA's official page](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads?target_os=Linux&target_arch=x86_64&Distribution=Ubuntu&target_version=24.04&target_type=deb_local).

### 2. Install Docker

If your system doesn't have Docker installed, download and install it:

-  Instructions for Ubuntu are [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).
-  Instructions for other Linux platforms are [here](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/).

### 3. Generate an NGC API Key

Obtain an API key from [NVIDIA NGC](https://org.ngc.nvidia.com/setup/api-key). This example refers to this key as `<NGC API KEY>`.

Log in to the NGC container registry:

```shell
docker login nvcr.io
```

Use the following credentials:

* Username: `$oauthtoken`
* Password: `<NGC API KEY>`

### 4. Install NVIDIA NGC CLI

Download and install the NVIDIA NGC CLI from [here](https://org.ngc.nvidia.com/setup/installers/cli).

### 5. Run the NIM Model

Save the following script as a shell script and execute it. (For more information, see [NVIDIA's documentation](https://docs.nvidia.com/nim/large-language-models/latest/getting-started.html#serving-models-from-local-assets).) Remember to substitute `<NGC API KEY>` with the API key you generated.

```shell
# Choose a container name
export CONTAINER_NAME=Llama3-8B-Instruct
NGC_API_KEY="<NGC API KEY>"
# Define the repository and image
Repository=nim/meta/llama3-8b-instruct
export IMG_NAME="nvcr.io/${Repository}:latest"
# Set local cache path
export LOCAL_NIM_CACHE=~/.cache/nim
mkdir -p "$LOCAL_NIM_CACHE"
# Start the LLM NIM container
docker run -it --rm --name=$CONTAINER_NAME \
--runtime=nvidia \
--gpus all \
--shm-size=16GB \
-e NGC_API_KEY=$NGC_API_KEY \
-v "$LOCAL_NIM_CACHE:/opt/nim/.cache" \
-u $(id -u) \
-p 8000:8000 \
$IMG_NAME 
```

### 6. Test the deployment

To verify the model is working, run the following command:

```shell
curl -X POST "http://0.0.0.0:8000/v1/chat/completions" \
    -H "Accept: application/json" \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model": "meta/llama3-8b-instruct",
        "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Tell me a story"
        }
        ]
    }'
```

Once you've verified the model is working, you can use it with EDB Postgres AI Accelerator.

Record the public IP address of the EC2 instance, as you'll need it to connect to the model from EDB Postgres AI Accelerator. This example refers to this address as `<NIM_HOST>`.

## Integrating the model with AI Accelerator

### 1. Enable AI Accelerator in EDB Postgres AI

With EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Extended Server, or a community Postgres instance running, connect to the database. Then enable the AI Accelerator extension by running the following SQL commands:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION aidb CASCADE;
```

### 2. Register the model

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model(
'my_nim_llm',
'nim_completions',
'{"model": "meta/llama-3.3-70b-instruct", "url": "http://<NIM_HOST>:8000/v1/chat/completions"}'::JSONB
);
```

### 3. Run the model

To interact with the model, execute the following query:

```sql
SELECT aidb.decode_text('my_nim_llm', 'Tell me a short, one sentence story');
__OUTPUT__
                                          decode_text                                       
    ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
     As the clock struck midnight, a single tear fell from the porcelain doll's glassy eye.
```

Your output may vary. You've successfully used NVIDIA NIM models via the EDB AI Accelerator.
