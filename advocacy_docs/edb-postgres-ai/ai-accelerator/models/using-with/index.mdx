description: How to use OpenAI-compatible and Nvidia NIM models with AI Accelerator Pipelines.
---

In this section we look at some particular ways to use models with AI Accelerator Pipelines.
These techniques show how to use API compatible services, running locally or in the cloud, with Pipelines and how to make use of Nvidia NIM models.

* [OpenAI API-compatible services](openai-api-compatibility) with Pipelines.
* [Nvidia NIM models](using-nvidia-nim) with Pipelines.
  * [In the Nvidia cloud](using-nvidia-nim/using-nim-in-nvidia-cloud)
  * [In your environment](using-nvidia-nim/using-nim-in-your-environment)
