---

This section describes some particular ways to use models with AI Accelerator Pipelines.
These techniques show how to use API-compatible services, running locally or in the cloud, with Pipelines and how to make use of NVIDIA NIM models.

* [OpenAI API-compatible services](openai-api-compatibility) with Pipelines.
* [NVIDIA NIM models](using-nvidia-nim) with Pipelines.
  * [In the NVIDIA NGC](using-nvidia-nim/using-nim-in-nvidia-ngc)
  * [In your environment](using-nvidia-nim/using-nim-in-your-environment)
