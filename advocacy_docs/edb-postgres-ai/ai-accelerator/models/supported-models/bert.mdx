## About BERT

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a transformer-based model that is used for natural language processing tasks such as text classification, text generation, and text completion. It is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data and is capable of performing a wide range of natural language processing tasks.

## Supported aidb operations

* encode_text
* encode_text_batch

* sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (default)
* sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v1
* sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L12-v1

## Creating the default model

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model('my_bert_model', 'bert_local');
```

## Creating a specific model

You can specify a model and revision in the options JSONB object. In this example, we are creating a `sentence-transformers/all-distilroberta-v1` model with the name `another_bert_model`:

```sql
select aidb.create_model(
  'another_bert_model',
  'bert_local',
  '{"model": "sentence-transformers/all-distilroberta-v1", "revision": "main"}'::JSONB 
)
```

## Model configuration settings

The following configuration settings are available for CLIP models:

* `model` - The BERT model to use. The default is `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`.
* `revision` - The revision of the model to use. The default is `refs/pr/64`. This entry is a reference to the model revision in the HuggingFace repository, and is used to specify the model version to use, in this case [this branch](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/tree/refs%2Fpr%2F64).

## Model credentials

No credentials are required for the BERT models as they run locally.
