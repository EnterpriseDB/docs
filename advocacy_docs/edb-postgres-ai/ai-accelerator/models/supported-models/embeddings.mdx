## About embeddings

OpenAI embeddings is a text-embedding model that enables use of any OpenAI API-compatible text-embedding model. It's suitable for text classification, clustering, and other text-embedding tasks.

Based on the name of the model, the model provider sets defaults accordingly:

* When invoked as `embeddings` or `openai_embeddings`, the model provider defaults to using the OpenAI API.

* When invoked as `nim_embeddings`, the model provider defaults to using the NVIDIA NIM API.

## Supported aidb operations

* encode_text
* encode_text_batch

## Supported models

* Any text-embedding model that's supported by the provider.

### Supported OpenAI models

* Any text-embedding model that's supported by OpenAI. This includes `text-embedding-3-small`, `text-embedding-3-large`, and `text-embedding-ada-002`. See a list of supported OpenAI models [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings#embedding-models).
* The default is `text-embedding-3-small`.

### Supported NIM models

* [nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5) (default)

## Creating the default with OpenAI model

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model('my_openai_embeddings', 
                            'openai_embeddings',
                            credentials=>'{"api_key": "sk-abc123xyz456def789ghi012jkl345mn"'::JSONB);
```

As this example is defaulting the model to `text-embedding-3-small`, you don't need to specify the model in the configuration. But you do need to pass an OpenAI API key in the credentials. For that, you must pass credentials as a named parameter.

## Creating a specific model

You can create any supported OpenAI embedding model using the `aidb.create_model` function. This example creates a `text-embedding-3-large` model with the name `my_openai_model`:

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model(
  'my_openai_model',
  'openai_embeddings',
  '{"model": "text-embedding-3-large"}'::JSONB,
  '{"api_key": "sk-abc123xyz456def789ghi012jkl345mn"}'::JSONB 
);
```

Because this example is passing the configuration options and the credentials, unlike the previous example, you don't need to pass the credentials as a named parameter.

## Model configuration settings

The following configuration settings are available for OpenAI models:

* `model` &mdash; The OpenAI model to use.
* `url` &mdash; The URL of the model to use. This value is optional and can be used to specify a custom model URL.  
  * If `openai_completions` (or `completions`) is the `model`, `url` defaults to `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`. 
  * If `nim_completions` is the `model`, `url` defaults to `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/chat/completions`.
* `max_concurrent_requests` &mdash; The maximum number of concurrent requests to make to the OpenAI model. The default is `25`.

## Model credentials

The following credentials are required for OpenAI models:

* `api_key` &mdash; The OpenAI API key to use for authentication.
