## About Embeddings

OpenAI Embeddings is a text embedding model that enables use of any OpenAI API complatible text embedding model. It is suitable for text classification, clustering, and other text embedding tasks.

Depending on the name of the model, the model provider will set defaults accordingly.

When invoked as `embeddings` or `openai_embeddings`, the model provider will default to using the OpenAI API.

When invoked as `nim_embeddings`, the model provider will default to using the NVIDIA NIM API.

## Supported aidb operations

* encode_text
* encode_text_batch

## Supported models

* Any text embedding model that is supported by the provider.

### Supported OpenAI models

* Any text embedding model that is supported by OpenAI. This includes `text-embedding-3-small`, `text-embedding-3-large`, and `text-embedding-ada-002`. See a list of supported OpenAI models [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings#embedding-models).
* Defaults to `text-embedding-3-small`.

### Supported NIM models

* [nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5) (default)

## Creating the default with OpenAI model

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model('my_openai_embeddings', 
                            'openai_embeddings',
                            credentials=>'{"api_key": "sk-abc123xyz456def789ghi012jkl345mn"'::JSONB);
```

As we are defaulting the model to `text-embedding-3-small`, we do not need to specify the model in the configuration. But we do need to pass an OpenAI API key in the credentials, and for that we have to pass credentials as a named parameter.

## Creating a specific model

You can create any supported OpenAI embedding model using the `aidb.create_model` function. In this example, we are creating a `text-embedding-3-large` model with the name `my_openai_model`:

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model(
  'my_openai_model',
  'openai_embeddings',
  '{"model": "text-embedding-3-large"}'::JSONB,
  '{"api_key": "sk-abc123xyz456def789ghi012jkl345mn"}'::JSONB 
);
```

Because we are passing the configuration options and the credentials, unlike the previous example, we do not need to pass the credentials as a named parameter.

## Model configuration settings

The following configuration settings are available for OpenAI models:

* `model` - The OpenAI model to use.
* `url` - The URL of the model to use. This is optional and can be used to specify a custom model URL.  
  * If `openai_completions` (or `completions`) is the `model`, `url` defaults to `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`. 
  * If `nim_completions` is the `model`, `url` defaults to `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/chat/completions`.
* `max_concurrent_requests` - The maximum number of concurrent requests to make to the OpenAI model. Defaults to `25`.

## Model credentials

The following credentials may be required by the service providing these models:

* `api_key` - The OpenAI API key to use for authentication.
