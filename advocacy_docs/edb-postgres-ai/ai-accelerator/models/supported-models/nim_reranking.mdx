## About reranking

Reranking is a method in text search that sorts results by relevance to make them more accurate. It gives scores to documents using cross-attention mechanisms, improving the initial search results.

## Supported aidb operations

* rerank_text

## Supported models

### NVIDIA NGC

* nvidia/llama-3.2-nv-rerankqa-1b-v2 (default)



## Creating the default model

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model(
    'my_nim_reranker', 
    'nim_reranking',
    credentials=>'{"api_key": "<API_KEY_HERE>"'::JSONB
);
```

There's only one model, the default `nvidia/nvclip`, so you don't need to specify the model in the configuration. 

## Model configuration settings

The following configuration settings are available for NIM models:

* `model` &mdash; The NIM model to use. The default is `nvidia/llama-3.2-nv-rerankqa-1b-v2` and is the only model available.
* `url` &mdash; The URL of the model to use. This setting is optional and can be used to specify a custom model URL. The default is `https://ai.api.nvidia.com/v1/retrieval`.

## Model credentials

The following credentials are required if executing inside NVIDIA NGC:

* `api_key` &mdash; The NVIDIA Cloud API key to use for authentication.
