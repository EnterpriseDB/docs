## About reranking

Reranking is a method in text search that sorts results by relevance to make them more accurate. It gives scores to documents using cross-attention mechanisms, improving the initial search results.

## Supported aidb operations

* rerank_text

## Supported models

### NVIDIA NGC

* nvidia/llama-3.2-nv-rerankqa-1b-v2 (default)


## Example
The function accepts a string as the "rerank query" and an array of texts to rerank.
The `id` column in the output refers to the index of the text in the input array.

```sql
aidb=# SELECT * from aidb.rerank_text('my_nim_reranker', 'how can I open a door?', '{Ask for help, Push the handle, Lie down and wait, Shout at it}'::text[]) ORDER BY logit_score DESC;
       text        | logit_score  | id
-------------------+--------------+----
 Push the handle   | -3.697265625 |  1
 Ask for help      |   -6.2578125 |  0
 Shout at it       |  -7.39453125 |  3
 Lie down and wait |      -11.375 |  2
(4 rows)
```


## Creating the default model

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model(
    'my_nim_reranker',
    'nim_reranking',
    '{"url":"http://nim-nv-rerankqa-llama-l-1xgpu-g6-predictor.default.svc.cluster.local/v1/ranking", "model": "nvidia/llama-3.2-nv-rerankqa-1b-v2"}'
    );
```

This example uses a locally deployed NIM model that does not require credentials. Credentials and other configuration can be provided as described in [using models](../using-models).

## Model configuration settings

The following configuration settings are available for NIM models:

* `model` &mdash; The NIM model to use. The default is `nvidia/llama-3.2-nv-rerankqa-1b-v2` and is the only supported model.
* `url` &mdash; The URL of the model to use. This setting is optional and can be used to specify a custom model URL. The default is `https://ai.api.nvidia.com/v1/retrieval`.

## Model credentials

The following credentials are required if executing inside NVIDIA NGC:

* `api_key` &mdash; The NVIDIA Cloud API key to use for authentication.
