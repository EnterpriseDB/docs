## About T5

T5 is a text-to-text transformer model that converts input text to output text. It's based on the Transformer architecture where an encoder processes the input and a decoder then generates the output. It's pre-trained on a large corpus of text data and is capable of performing a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as chatbots, translation, summarization, and question answering.
