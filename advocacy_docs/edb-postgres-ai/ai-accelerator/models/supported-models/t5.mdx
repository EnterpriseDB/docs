## About T5

T5 is a text-to-text transformer model that converts input text into output text. It is based on the Transformer architecture where encoder processes the input and a decoder then genrates the output. It is pre-trained on a large corpus of text data and is capable of performing a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as chatbots, translation, summarization, and question answering.

## Creating the default model

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model('my_t5_model', 't5_local');
```

## Creating a specific model

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model(

  't5_local',
  '{"model": "t5-large", "revision": "main"}'::JSONB 
)
```

## Model configuration settings
