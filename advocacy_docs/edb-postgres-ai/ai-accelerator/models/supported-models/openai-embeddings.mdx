## About OpenAI Embeddings

OpenAI Embeddings is a text embedding model that enables use of any supported OpenAI text embedding model. It is suitable for text classification, clustering, and other text embedding tasks.

See a list of supported OpenAI models [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings#embedding-models).

## Supported aidb operations

* encode_text
* encode_text_batch

## Supported models

* Any text embedding model that is supported by OpenAI. This includes `text-embedding-3-small`, `text-embedding-3-large`, and `text-embedding-ada-002`.
* Defaults to `text-embedding-3-small`.

## Creating the default model

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model('my_openai_embeddings', 
                            'openai_embeddings',
                            credentials=>'{"api_key": "sk-abc123xyz456def789ghi012jkl345mn"'::JSONB);
```

As we are defaulting the model to `text-embedding-3-small`, we do not need to specify the model in the configuration. But we do need to pass an OpenAI API key in the credentials, and for that we have to pass credentials as a named parameter.

## Creating a specific model

You can create any supported OpenAI embedding model using the `aidb.create_model` function. In this example, we are creating a `text-embedding-3-large` model with the name `my_openai_model`:

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model(
  'my_openai_model',
  'openai_embeddings',
  '{"model": "text-embedding-3-large"}'::JSONB,
  '{"api_key": "sk-abc123xyz456def789ghi012jkl345mn"}'::JSONB 
);
```

Because we are passing the configuration options and the credentials, unlike the previous example, we do not need to pass the credentials as a named parameter.

## Model configuration settings

The following configuration settings are available for OpenAI models:

* `model` - The OpenAI model to use.
* `url` - The URL of the OpenAI model to use. This is optional and can be used to specify a custom model URL. Defaults to `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`.
* `max_concurrent_requests` - The maximum number of concurrent requests to make to the OpenAI model. Defaults to `25`.
