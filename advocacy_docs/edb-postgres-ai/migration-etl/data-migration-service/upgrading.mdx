EDB recommends upgrading the EDB DMS Reader when it is not performing a streaming migration. However, you can also temporarily stop a migration to perform an upgrade.
The EDB DMS Reader components are designed to terminate and restart gracefully.

To upgrade the software:

1. If the EDB DMS reader is currently running, stop the process.

1. Install and start a new version of the EDB DMS Reader.

1. Continue the migration by restarting the EDB DMS Reader with the updated software.
