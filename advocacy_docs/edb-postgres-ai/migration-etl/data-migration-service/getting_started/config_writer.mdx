This step is optional. Configure and run the EDB DMS Writer only if the destination for your migration is a self-managed Postgres database.

## Getting credentials

Create migration credentials to enable the EDB DMS Writer on your [auxiliary machine](../terminology/#auxiliary-machine) to connect to the Hybrid Manager (HM) for migrations. You need one set of credentials per destination [HM project](../../../hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/projects/).

For example, if you are using a single Hybrid Manager (HM) project for all migrations, you only need one set of credentials on your auxiliary machine.

1.  On the HM Console, select the project you are using for your migration activities.

2.  Within your project, select **Migrate** > **Credentials**.

3.  Select **Create Migration Credential**, enter a name for your credentials, and select **Create Migration Credential**.

4.  After the credentials are generated, select **Download Credential**.

    !!!note

        This is the only opportunity you have to download the credentials. If you don't download them at this time, you will have to revoke them and create new credentials.

5.  Unzip the downloaded zip file and copy the generated folder to the host where the writer is installed.

## Configuring the writer

1.  Ensure your machine has Java/OpenJDK 17 or later installed.

2.  Open the EDB DMS Writer located in `/opt/cdcwriter/run-cdcwriter.sh` and ensure you have write permissions.

3.  Set the variables according to your environment. Uncomment the lines as you edit or review them, the DMS can only perform migrations when all necessary values are provided. See [parameters](config_writer.mdx#parameters) for further guidance. The script is reproduced below.

```shell
#!/bin/bash -e

## Parameters

### DMS Writer general configuration

These parameters define the information the EDB DMS Writer requires to access the HM instance and project that you are using for the migration.

#### `DBCONFIG_ID`

This is the name you assign to identify a destination. This name will later appear as a *destination* in the **Migrate** > **Destinations** section of the HM Console.

Consider the following ID guidelines:

-   The maximum character length for the ID is 255 characters.
-   You can use lowercase and uppercase characters, numbers, underscores(\_) and hyphens(-) for the ID. Other special characters are not supported.
-   The ID must be unique within a project. Do not use the same ID for two or more destinations in the same project.

#### `CLOUD_PROVIDER`

Only required in HM versions 1.1 and earlier. Set to `appliance`.

#### `RW_SERVICE_HOST`

Specifies the URL of the service that will host the migration. Set `RW_SERVICE_HOST` to the domain name or host associated with the HM ingress.

Derive `RW_SERVICE_HOST` from the `TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME` that was assigned by the administrators or installers of your HM instance via the `values.yaml` file. Alternatively, derive `RW_SERVICE_HOST` from the URL you use to access the HM Console. 

For example, if the URL for an HM Console is:

`https://portal.foo-bar.enterprise.network`

The `RW_SERVICE_HOST` will be: 

`https://transporter-rw-service.foo-bar.enterprise.network/transporter`

where you replace `portal` with `transporter-rw-service` and add `/transporter` at the end of the endpoint.

#### `TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`

Directory path to the `client-key.pem` private key you downloaded from the HM Console.

The HTTP client of the EDB DMS Writer uses it to perform mTLS authentication with the `transporter-rw-service`.

#### `TLS_CERTIFICATE_PATH`

Directory path to the X509 `client-cert.pem` certificate you downloaded from the HM Console.

The HTTP client of the EDB DMS Writer uses it to perform mTLS authentication with the `transporter-rw-service`.

#### `TLS_CA_PATH`

Directory path to the `int.cert` Certificate Authority you downloaded from the HM Console.

It signs the certificate configured in `TLS_CERTIFICATE_PATH`.

#### `APICURIOREQUEST_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_LOCATION`

Directory path to the `client-keystore.p12` keystore location file you downloaded from the HM Console.
It is created from the private key and certificate configured in `TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` and `TLS_CERTIFICATE_PATH`.

The Apicurio client uses it to perform mTLS authentication with the `transporter-rw-service`.

#### `APICURIOREQUEST_TRUSTSTORE_LOCATION`

Created from the Certificate Authority configured in `TLS_CA_PATH`.

The Apicurio client uses it to perform mTLS authentication with the `transporter-rw-service`.

#### `KAFKASECURITY_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_LOCATION`

Directory path to the `client-keystore.p12` keystore location file you downloaded from the HM (same path as `APICURIOREQUEST_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_LOCATION`).

This will be required for Kafka client authentication later when the HM creates Kafka pods to perform the migration.

#### `KAFKASECURITY_TRUSTSTORE_LOCATION`

Directory path to the `int.truststore.p12` location file you downloaded from the HM (same path as `APICURIOREQUEST_TRUSTSTORE_LOCATION`).

This will be required for Kafka client authentication later when the HM creates Kafka pods to perform the migration.

### DMS Writer object storage configuration

These optional parameters (that start with `AWS_`) provide the EDB DMS Writer with information it requires to use object storage to improve performance for migrations. If one or more of your tables contain a row with data larger than 1 MB, the EDB DMS Writer won't be able to continue writing to the destination, as it lacks resources to do so.

Currently (HM version 1.1), configuring object storage for the reader is a manual process. This configuration, which involves specifying details for an existing AWS S3 bucket or other S3-compatible storage (like MinIO) already set up for HM, is an installer/administrator task. Users needing to configure these `AWS_` values must contact their HM installer/administrator.

In later HM versions, an autodiscovery mechanism will automatically use the same object storage an installer/administrator configured for the HM. In this case, you won't need to provide any of the `AWS_` values.

Contact the installer/administrator to obtain all of the following `AWS_` values: 

#### `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`

1) If your environment is using AWS S3, set this value to the access key ID that has read and write permissions for the S3 bucket.

2) If your environment is using S3-compatible storage, like MinIO, set this value to the access key for your object storage.

#### `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`

1) If your environment is using AWS S3, set this value to the secret access key that has read and write permissions for the specified S3 bucket.

2) If your environment is using S3-compatible storage, like MinIO, set this value to the secret key for your object storage.

#### `AWS_REGION`

1) If your environment is using AWS S3, set this value to the region specified in `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3`.

2) If your environment is using S3-compatible storage, such as MinIO, this setting is not required.

#### `AWS_CA_BUNDLE` (Optional)

Set this value only if your environment is using a self-signed certificate for object storage. Set this value to the path to the CA bundle file.

This setting is not required if your environment is using AWS S3 or S3-compatible storage with publicly trusted certificate authorities (CAs).

#### `AWS_ENDPOINT_URL_S3`

1) If your environment is using AWS S3, set this value to the endpoint URL. See AWS documentation: [AWS S3 Endpoints](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html).

2) If your environment is using S3-compatible storage, like MinIO, set this value according to the object storage configuration.

#### `BUCKET_NAME`

Specify the name of the bucket the environment administrator has made available for the migration. The bucket must be created before starting the migration.

### DMS Writer destination database configuration

These parameters (`DBCONFIG_DATABASES` section) define a list of destination database information you require for the EDB DMS Writer to be able to write to the correct destination database for the migration.

You can configure the EDB DMS Writer to migrate multiple databases. The `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__TYPE` section delimits the information for the first database. You can use `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_1__TYPE` to provide data for a second database. Add more sections to the EDB DMS Writer (`DBCONFIG_DATABASES_2__TYPE`, `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_3__TYPE`) by increasing the index manually.

#### `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__TYPE`

This is the destination database type. EDB DMS Writer supports `POSTGRES`.

#### `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__HOSTNAME`

The hostname of the destination database.

#### `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__PORT`

The port of the destination database.

#### `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__CATALOG`

The database name in the destination database server.

#### `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__USERNAME`

The database username of the destination database.

#### `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__PASSWORD`

The password for the database username of the destination database.

## Running the EDB DMS Writer

1.  Start the migration:

    ```shell
    cd /opt/cdcwriter
    ./run-cdcwriter.sh
    ```

2.  Go to the HM Console, and verify that a destination with the `DBCONFIG_ID` name is displayed in **Migrate** > **Destinations**.

You can select this destination for your [migration](create_migration.mdx).
