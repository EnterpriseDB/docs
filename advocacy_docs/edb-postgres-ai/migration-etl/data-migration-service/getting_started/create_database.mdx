title: "Creating a database cluster"

You can use an existing EDB PostgresÂ® AI cluster or create a new cluster for the target of the database migration. 

To use an existing cluster as a target for the migration, ensure the tables you migrate and the load generated on target doesn't interfere with existing workloads.

1.  Access the [EDB Postgres AI Console](https://portal.biganimal.com) and log in with your EDB Postgres AI Database Cloud Service credentials.

1.  Select the project where you want to create the database cluster.

    See [Creating a project](/biganimal/latest/administering_cluster/projects/#creating-a-project) if you want to create one.

1.  Within your project, select **Create New** and **Database Cluser** to create an instance that will serve as target for the EDB Data Migration Service (EDB DMS).

    See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/release/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/) for detailed instructions on how to create a single-node or a primary/standby high availability cluster.

    See [Creating a distributed high-availability cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/creating_a_dha_cluster/) for detailed instructions on how to create a distributed high availibility cluster.

1.  In the **Clusters** page, select your cluster, and use the **Quick Connect** option to access your instance from your terminal.

1.  Create a new empty database that you will use as a target for the migration. Alternatively, you can use the default database `edb_admin`.
