You can use existing databases (HCP-managed or self-managed) as destinations for migrations. To use an existing instance as a destination for the migration, ensure the tables you migrate and the load generated on the destination don't interfere with existing workloads.

If you don't have a destination database yet, this page shows you how to create a new database, either on an HCP-managed cluster or on a self-managed database.

## Create a new database cluster in HCP

If you don't have a destination database cluster on the HCP yet, create one that the HCP can use as destination for migrations:

1.  In the HCP Portal, select the project where you want to create the database cluster.

    See [Creating a project](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/edb-postgres-ai/console/using/projects/managing_projects/#creating-a-new-project) if you want to create one.

2.  Within your project, select **Create New** and **Database Cluster** to create an instance that will serve as destination for the EDB Data Migration Service (EDB DMS).

    See [Creating a cluster](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/creating_cluster/creating_a_cluster/) for detailed instructions on how to create a single-node or a primary/standby high availability cluster.

    See [Creating a distributed high-availability cluster](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/creating_cluster/creating_a_dha_cluster/) for detailed instructions on how to create a distributed high availibility cluster.

3.  In the **Clusters** page, select your cluster, and use the **Quick Connect** option to access your instance from your terminal.

4.  Create a new empty database that you will use as a destination for the migration. Alternatively, you can use the default database `edb_admin`.

## Create a new database on a self-managed instance

If you don't have a self-managed destination database yet, create one that the EDB DMS Writer can connect to for HCP migrations. This example assumes you have configured your self-managed Postgres instance already.

1.  Connect to the destination Postgres server:

    ```shell
    psql -p <PG_PORT> -U <PG_USERNAME>
    ```

2.  Create an empty destination database that you'll use as a destination for the migration. 

    In this example, the destination database is called `tr_target`: 

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE tr_target;
    ```
