title: Installing EDB Data Migration Service Writer on RHEL 8 or OL 8 x86_64
navTitle: RHEL 8 or OL 8

---

Before you begin the installation process:

-   Set up the EDB repository.

    Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

    To determine if your repository exists, enter this command:

    `dnf repolist | grep enterprisedb`

    If no output is generated, the repository isn't installed.

    To set up the EDB repository:

    1.  Go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).

    2.  Select the button that provides access to the EDB repository.

    3.  Select the platform and software that you want to download.

    4.  Follow the instructions for setting up the EDB repository.

## Install the package

Install the EDB DMS Writer (packaged as `cdcwriter`):

```shell
sudo dnf install cdcwriter
```
