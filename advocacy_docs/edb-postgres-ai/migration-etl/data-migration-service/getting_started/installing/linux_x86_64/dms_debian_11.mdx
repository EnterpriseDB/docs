navTitle: Debian 11
title: Installing the EDB DMS Reader on Debian 11 x86_64
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the EDB repository.

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

  To determine if your repository exists, enter:

  `apt-cache search enterprisedb`

  If no output is generated, the repository isn't installed.

  To set up the EDB repository:

  1. Go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).

  1. Select the button that provides access to the EDB repo.

  1. Select the platform and software that you want to download.

## Install the package

Install the EDB DMS Reader (packaged as `cdcreader`):

```shell
sudo apt-get install cdcreader
```
