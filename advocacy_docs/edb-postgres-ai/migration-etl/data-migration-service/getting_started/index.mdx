Creating a migration from an Oracle or Postgres database to EDB Postgres AI involves several steps.

**Prerequisite**: Ensure you have Java 17 or later installed.

1.  **[Create a destination Postgres database cluster](create_database.mdx)**: Ensure you have created and configured a destination database. This can be a database in an HM-managed cluster, or in a self-managed Postgres instance.

2.  **[Prepare the source database schema](prepare_schema.mdx)**: In your source machine, prepare the source database by exporting it and excluding unsupported constraints. Then, import the adapted schema to the destination database.

3.  **[Install the EDB DMS Reader(Only applicable to HCP with versions <= 1.2.0)](installing)**: In your source machine, install the EDB DMS Reader from the EDB repository.

4.  **Optional** - [Install the EDB DMS Writer(Only applicable to HCP with versions <= 1.2.0)](installing2): Perform this step only if you want to migrate data to a destination database outside of the Hybrid Manager. In your destination machine, install the EDB DMS Writer from the EDB repository.

5.  **[Install the EDB DMS Agent(For HCP with versions > 1.2.0)](installing_agent)**: In your source or destination machine, install the EDB DMS Agent from the EDB repository. DMS Agent is the package that will install the DMS Reader and DMS Writer together on your machine.

6.  **[Prepare your Oracle or Postgres database](preparing_db)**: In your source/destination machine, prepare the database by altering settings and creating users that are required for the migration. Ensure your database can accept SSL connections.

7.  **[Configure the EDB DMS Reader(Only applicable to HCP with versions <= 1.2.0)](config_reader.mdx)**: In the Hybrid Manager Console, download dedicated migration credentials. In your source machine, configure the EDB DMS Reader by exporting environment variables that allow the Reader to connect to the source. Execute the Reader.

8.  **Optional - [Configure the EDB DMS Writer(Only applicable to HCP with versions <= 1.2.0)](config_writer.mdx)**: Perform this step only if you want to migrate data to a destination database outside of the Hybrid Manager. In your destination machine, configure the EDB DMS Writer by exporting environment variables that allow the Writer to connect to the destination. Execute the Writer.

9. **[Configure the EDB DMS Agent(For HCP with versions > 1.2.0)](config_agent)**: In the Hybrid Control Plane portal, download dedicated migration credentials. In your source or destination machine, configure the EDB DMS Agent by exporting environment variables that allow the Agent to connect to the source and destination databases. Execute the Agent.

10.  **[Create a new migration](create_migration.mdx)**: In the EDB Postgres AI Console, create a new migration by selecting the source generated by the Reader in the Console, and selecting the destination database you created for this purpose.

11.  **[Mark the Migration as completed](mark_completed.mdx)**: In the EDB Postgres AI Console, mark the migration as completed to stop the streaming process.

12. **[Reapply any excluded constraints](apply_constraints.mdx)**: Apply the constraints you excluded from the schema migration in the new database.

13. **[Verify the migration completed successfully](verify_migration.mdx)**: Use LiveCompare to ensure the destination database has the same data as the source database.
