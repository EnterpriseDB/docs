After you use the EDB DMS Reader to read the source database, create a new migration in the EDB PostgresÂ® AI Console. 
This establishes a sync between the source database and a target cluster in the EDB Postgres AI Console. 

1.  Access the [EDB Postgres AI Console](https://portal.biganimal.com) and log in with your EDB Postgres AI Database Cloud Service credentials.

1.  Select the project where you created the database cluster. 

1.  Within your project, select **Migrate** > **Migrations**. 

1.  In the **Migrations** page, select **Create New Migration** > **To Managed Postgres**.

1.  In the **Create Migration** page, assign a **Name** to the migration. 

1.  Select the **Source** of the migration. The ID for the EDB DMS Reader is listed in the drop-down menu.

1.  Under **Destination**, select a target cluster for the migration and enter the name of the database where you want the migration to copy data and select **Next**. 

1.  Select the tables and columns to migrate. Modify the table and column names if needed.

1.  Select **Create Migration**.
