---

After you have configured the EDB DMS Reader (and Writer, for migrations into external databases) to establish connections to the HCP, create a new migration in the HCP Portal. A migration establishes a sync between the source database and a destination database with the help of EDB DMS.

1.  In the HCP Portal, select the project from which you want to manage the migration.

2.  Within your project, select **Migrate** > **Migrations**. 

3.  In the **Migrations** page, select **Create New Migration**. 

4.  In the **Create Migration** page, assign a **Name** to the migration. 

5.  Select the **Source** of the migration. The ID for the EDB DMS Reader is listed in the drop-down menu.

6.  Select the migration type, [**Snapshot**](../terminology.mdx#snapshot-migration) or [**Snapshot + Streaming**](../terminology.mdx#snapshot-streaming-migration).

7.  Under **Destination Type**, select a destination for the migration. This can be a [**Managed Postgres**](../terminology.mdx#managed-postgres) or [**External Postgres**](../terminology.mdx#external-postgres) instance. Select the destination cluster and database accordingly and select **Next**.

8.  Select the tables and columns to migrate. Modify the table and column names if needed.

9.  Select **Create Migration**.

The Hybrid Control Plane portal now displays a new migration.

If you chose the **Snapshot + Streaming** option, the EDB DMS Reader is constantly streaming data when the migration displays the **Running** state. Changes to data are replicated from the source to the destination database as long as the migration is running. 

!!!note

    The EDB DMS Reader streams data changes. It does not stream changes in the DDL objects.
