title: "Creating a migration"
---

After you use the EDB DMS Reader to read the source database, create a new migration in the EDB PostgresÂ® AI Console. 
This establishes a sync between the source database and a target cluster in the EDB Postgres AI Console. 

1.  Access your Hybrid Control Plane portal and log in with your EDB Postgres AI credentials.

1.  Select the project from which you want to manage the migration.

1.  Within your project, select **Migrate** > **Migrations**. 

1.  In the **Migrations** page, select **Create New Migration**. 

1.  In the **Create Migration** page, assign a **Name** to the migration. 

1.  Select the **Source** of the migration. The ID for the EDB DMS Reader is listed in the drop-down menu.

1.  Select the migration type, [**Snapshot**](/edb-postgres-ai/migration-etl/data-migration-service/terminology/#snapshot-migration) or [**Snapshot + Streaming**](/edb-postgres-ai/migration-etl/data-migration-service/terminology/#snapshot--streaming-migration).

1.  Under **Destination Type**, select a target for the migration. This can be a [**Managed Postgres**](/edb-postgres-ai/migration-etl/data-migration-service/terminology/#managed-postgres) or [**External Postgres**](/edb-postgres-ai/migration-etl/data-migration-service/terminology/#external-postgres) instance. Select the destination cluster and database accordingly and select **Next**.

1.  Select the tables and columns to migrate. Modify the table and column names if needed.

1.  Select **Create Migration**.

The Hybrid Control Plane portal now displays a new migration.

If you chose the **Snapshot + Streaming** option, the EDB DMS Reader is constantly streaming data when the migration displays the **Running** state. Changes to data are replicated from the source to the target database as long as the migration is running. 

!!!note 
   The EDB DMS Reader streams data changes. It does not stream changes in the DDL objects.
