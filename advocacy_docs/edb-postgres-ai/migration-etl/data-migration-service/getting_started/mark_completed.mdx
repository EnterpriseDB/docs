title: "Mark migration as completed"
---

The EDB DMS Reader will continue to stream any data updates performed on the source database to the target database until you mark the migration as completed. Check that your data is present in the target database before you mark it as completed. 

1.  In the [EDB Postgres AI Console](https://portal.biganimal.com), in your project, select **Migrate** > **Migrations**.

1.  Select the **check icon** next to your migration to mark the migration as completed. This stops the streaming procedure.
