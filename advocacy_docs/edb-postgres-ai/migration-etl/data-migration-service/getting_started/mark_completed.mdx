title: "Mark migration as completed"
---

If you selected the [**Snapshot + Streaming**](/edb-postgres-ai/migration-etl/data-migration-service/terminology/#snapshot--streaming-migration) option during [Migration creation](create_migration), the EDB DMS Reader will continue to stream any data updates performed on the source database to the target database until you mark the migration as completed (for example, to perform a cutover).

If you selected the [**Snapshot**](/edb-postgres-ai/migration-etl/data-migration-service/terminology/#snapshot-migration) option, you can skip this step, as the DMS will automatically mark the migration as completed after it finishes copying the entire snapshot to the destination.

## Stop the streaming process

For [**Snapshot + Streaming**](/edb-postgres-ai/migration-etl/data-migration-service/terminology/#snapshot--streaming-migration) migrations only. 

It is important that you carefully select the best time to stop the data migration stream. Ensure no new inserts are executed in the source and verify that the last known inserts have been synchronized in the target.

After checking that your data is present in the target database you can stop the stream by marking the migration as completed.

1.  In the Hybrid Control Plane portal, in your project, select **Migrate** > **Migrations**.

1.  Select the **check icon** next to your migration to mark the migration as completed. This stops the streaming procedure.
