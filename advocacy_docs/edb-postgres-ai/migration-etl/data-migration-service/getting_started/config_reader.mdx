Create migration credentials to enable the EDB DMS Reader on your [auxiliary machine](../terminology/#auxiliary-machine) to connect to the Hybrid Manager for migrations. You need one set of credentials per destination [Hybrid Manager project](../../../hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/projects/). 

For example, if you are using a single Hybrid Manager project for all migrations, you only need one set of credentials on your auxiliary machine.

1.  On the Hybrid Manager Portal, select the project you are using for your migration activities.

2.  Within your project, select **Migrate** > **Credentials**.

3.  Select **Create Migration Credential**, enter a name for your credentials, and select **Create Migration Credential**.

4.  After the credentials are generated, select **Download Credential**.

    !!!note

        This is the only opportunity you have to download the credentials. If you don't download them at this time, you will have to revoke them and create new credentials.

5.  Unzip the downloaded zip file and copy the generated folder to the host where the reader is installed.

## Configuring the reader

1.  Ensure your machine has Java/OpenJDK 17 or later installed.

2.  Open the EDB DMS Reader located in `/opt/cdcreader/run-cdcreader.sh` and ensure you have write permissions.

3.  Set the variables according to your environment and uncomment the edited lines. See [parameters](config_reader.mdx#parameters) for further guidance. The script is reproduced below.

```shell
#!/bin/bash -e
# run_cdcreader.sh
#
# This script provides a convenient place to specify
# environment variables used to configure the
# EDB Data Migration Service Reader.
#
# After env exports, `java` is called to start the
# software.

## Parameters

### DMS Reader general configuration

These parameters define the information the EDB DMS Reader requires to access the Hybrid Manager instance and project that you are using for the migration.

#### `DBCONFIG_ID`

This is the name you assign to identify a source. This name will later appear as a *source* in the **Migrate** > **Sources** section of the EDB Postgres AI Console.

Consider the following ID guidelines:

-   The maximum character length for the ID is 255 characters.
-   You can use lowercase and uppercase characters, numbers, underscores(\_) and hyphens(-) for the ID. Other special characters are not supported.
-   The ID must be unique within a project. Do not use the same ID for two or more sources in the same project.

#### `RW_SERVICE_HOST`

Specifies the URL of the service that will host the migration. Set `RW_SERVICE_HOST` to the domain name or host associated with the Hybrid Manager ingress.

Derive `RW_SERVICE_HOST` from the `TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME` that was assigned by the administrators or installers of your Hybrid Manager instance via the `values.yaml` file. Alternatively, derive `RW_SERVICE_HOST` from the URL you use to access the Hybrid Manager Console. 

**Example:** If the URL for the Hybrid Manager Console is `https://portal.foo-bar.enterprise.network`, the `RW_SERVICE_HOST` will be `https://transporter-rw-service.foo-bar.enterprise.network/transporter` where you replace `portal` with `transporter-rw-service` and add `/transporter` at the end of the endpoint.

#### `TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`

Directory path to the `client-key.pem` private key you downloaded from the EDB Postgres AI Console.

The HTTP client of the EDB DMS Reader uses it to perform mTLS authentication with the `transporter-rw-service`.

#### `TLS_CERTIFICATE_PATH`

Directory path to the X509 `client-cert.pem` certificate you downloaded from the EDB Postgres AI Console.

The HTTP client of the EDB DMS Reader uses it to perform mTLS authentication with the `transporter-rw-service`.

#### `TLS_CA_PATH`

Directory path to the `int.cert` Certificate Authority you downloaded from the EDB Postgres AI Console.

It signs the certificate configured in `TLS_CERTIFICATE_PATH`.

#### `APICURIOREQUEST_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_LOCATION`

File path to the `client-keystore.p12` keystore location file you downloaded from the Hybrid Manager.
It is created from the private key and certificate configured in `TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` and `TLS_CERTIFICATE_PATH`.

The Apicurio client uses it to perform mTLS authentication with the `transporter-rw-service`.

#### `APICURIOREQUEST_TRUSTSTORE_LOCATION`

Created from the Certificate Authority configured in `TLS_CA_PATH`.

The Apicurio client uses it to perform mTLS authentication with the `transporter-rw-service`.

#### `KAFKASECURITY_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_LOCATION`

File path to the `client-keystore.p12` keystore location file you downloaded from the Hybrid Manager (same path as `APICURIOREQUEST_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_LOCATION`).

This will be required for Kafka client authentication later when the Hybrid Manager creates Kafka pods to perform the migration.

#### `KAFKASECURITY_TRUSTSTORE_LOCATION`

File path to the `int.truststore.p12` location file you downloaded from the Hybrid Manager (same path as `APICURIOREQUEST_TRUSTSTORE_LOCATION`).

This will be required for Kafka client authentication later when the Hybrid Manager creates Kafka pods to perform the migration.

### DMS Reader source database configuration

These parameters (`DBCONFIG_DATABASES` section) define a list of source database information you require for the EDB DMS Reader to be able to read the correct source database information for the migration.

You can configure the EDB DMS Reader to migrate multiple databases. The `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__TYPE` section delimits the information for the first database. You can use `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_1__TYPE` to provide data for a second database. Add more sections to the EDB DMS Reader (`DBCONFIG_DATABASES_2__TYPE`, `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_3__TYPE`) by increasing the index manually.

#### `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__TYPE`

This is the source database type. EDB DMS reader supports `ORACLE` and `POSTGRES`.

#### `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__HOSTNAME`

The hostname of the source database.

!!!note

    For RDS databases, ensure the `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__HOSTNAME` value points to the RDS endpoint you can find under the **Connectivity & security** in the AWS Console. A redacted example is `foo_database.cb7asw1xxxxx.eu-west-0.rds.amazonaws.com`.

#### `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__PORT`

The port of the source database.

#### `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__CATALOG`

The database name in the source database server.

#### `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__USERNAME`

The database username of the source database.

#### `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__PASSWORD`

The password for the database username of the source database.

#### `FIPS_MODE`

If you need to comply with FIPS standards, enable FIPS mode for the DMS Reader by setting the environment variable to true: `export FIPS_MODE=true`.

## Running the EDB DMS Reader

1.  Start the migration:

    ```shell
    cd /opt/cdcreader
    ./run-cdcreader.sh
    ```

2.  Go to the Hybrid Manager Console, and verify that a source with the `DBCONFIG_ID=` name is displayed in **Migrate** > **Sources**.

You can select this source for your [migration](create_migration.mdx).
