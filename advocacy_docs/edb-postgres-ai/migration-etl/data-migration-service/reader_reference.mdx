## DMS Reader general configuration

These parameters define the information the EDB DMS Reader requires to:

- Connect to the source database and collect data
- Access the Hybrid Manager (HM) instance and project that you are using for the migration

### DBCONFIG_ID

This is the name you assign to identify a source. This name will later appear as a *source* in the **Migrate** > **Sources** section of the HM Console.

Consider the following ID guidelines:

-   The maximum character length for the ID is 255 characters.
-   You can use lowercase and uppercase characters, numbers, underscores(\_) and hyphens(-) for the ID. Other special characters are not supported.
-   The ID must be unique within a project. Do not use the same ID for two or more sources in the same project.

### RW_SERVICE_HOST

Specifies the URL of the service that will host the migration. Set `RW_SERVICE_HOST` to the domain name or host associated with the Hybrid Manager ingress.

Derive `RW_SERVICE_HOST` from the `TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME` that was assigned by the administrators or installers of your Hybrid Manager instance via the `values.yaml` file. Alternatively, derive `RW_SERVICE_HOST` from the URL you use to access the Hybrid Manager Console. 

**Example:** If the URL for the Hybrid Manager Console is `https://portal.foo-bar.enterprise.network`, the `RW_SERVICE_HOST` will be `https://transporter-rw-service.foo-bar.enterprise.network/transporter` where you replace `portal` with `transporter-rw-service` and add `/transporter` at the end of the endpoint.

### TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH

Directory path to the `client-key.pem` private key you downloaded from the EDB Postgres AI Console.

The HTTP client of the EDB DMS Reader uses it to perform mTLS authentication with the `transporter-rw-service`.

### TLS_CERTIFICATE_PATH

Directory path to the X509 `client-cert.pem` certificate you downloaded from the EDB Postgres AI Console.

The HTTP client of the EDB DMS Reader uses it to perform mTLS authentication with the `transporter-rw-service`.

### TLS_CA_PATH

Directory path to the `int.cert` Certificate Authority you downloaded from the EDB Postgres AI Console.

It signs the certificate configured in `TLS_CERTIFICATE_PATH`.

### APICURIOREQUEST_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_LOCATION

File path to the `client-keystore.p12` keystore location file you downloaded from the Hybrid Manager.
It is created from the private key and certificate configured in `TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` and `TLS_CERTIFICATE_PATH`.

The Apicurio client uses it to perform mTLS authentication with the `transporter-rw-service`.

### APICURIOREQUEST_TRUSTSTORE_LOCATION

Created from the Certificate Authority configured in `TLS_CA_PATH`.

The Apicurio client uses it to perform mTLS authentication with the `transporter-rw-service`.

### KAFKASECURITY_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_LOCATION

File path to the `client-keystore.p12` keystore location file you downloaded from the Hybrid Manager (same path as `APICURIOREQUEST_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_LOCATION`).

This will be required for Kafka client authentication later when the Hybrid Manager creates Kafka pods to perform the migration.

### KAFKASECURITY_TRUSTSTORE_LOCATION

File path to the `int.truststore.p12` location file you downloaded from the Hybrid Manager (same path as `APICURIOREQUEST_TRUSTSTORE_LOCATION`).

This will be required for Kafka client authentication later when the Hybrid Manager creates Kafka pods to perform the migration.

## DMS Reader source database configuration

These parameters (`DBCONFIG_DATABASES` section) define a list of source database information you require for the EDB DMS Reader to be able to read the correct source database information for the migration.

You can configure the EDB DMS Reader to migrate multiple databases. The `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__TYPE` section delimits the information for the first database. You can use `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_1__TYPE` to provide data for a second database. Add more sections to the EDB DMS Reader (`DBCONFIG_DATABASES_2__TYPE`, `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_3__TYPE`) by increasing the index manually.

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__TYPE

This is the source database type. EDB DMS reader supports `ORACLE` and `POSTGRES`.

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__HOSTNAME

The hostname of the source database.

!!!note

    For RDS databases, ensure the `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__HOSTNAME` value points to the RDS endpoint you can find under the **Connectivity & security** in the AWS Console. A redacted example is `foo_database.cb7asw1xxxxx.eu-west-0.rds.amazonaws.com`.


### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__PORT

The port of the source database.

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__CATALOG

The database name in the source database server.

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__USERNAME

The database username of the source database.

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__PASSWORD

The password for the database username of the source database. You can set an environment variable for the password without specifying it in the script, but the variable must follow the format: `export DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__PASSWORD=password`

### FIPS_MODE

If you need to comply with FIPS standards, enable FIPS mode for the DMS Reader by setting the environment variable to true: `export FIPS_MODE=true`.
