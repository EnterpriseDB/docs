The EDB Data Migration Service (EDB DMS) is currently a public preview capability that is only available to users of EDB Postgres AI Hybrid Control Plane.

## Supported source databases

The following database versions are supported.

| Database version   | Supported source |
| ------------------ | ---------------- |
| PostgreSQL 12 - 17 | Y                |
| EPAS 12 - 17       | Y                |
| Oracle 19c         | Y                |
| Oracle 21c (\*)    | Y                |
| Oracle 23ai (\*)   | Y                |

The supported Postgres source databases only include externally-managed (self-managed) databases.

!!!note

    (\*) The Data Migration Service Reader and Writer support migrating Oracle 21c and 23ai databases. However, Migration Portal doesn't. This means that to migrate 21c and 23ai databases, you must manually perform the schema migration.

### Oracle

The EDB DMS stack requires the Oracle database to have archive log mode enabled and supplemental logging data enabled at the table and database level. For details, see [Preparing Oracle source databases](getting_started/preparing_db/preparing_oracle_source_databases.mdx).

Container databases (CDB/PDB) and non-CDB sources are supported.

### Postgres

When migrating from Postgres towards Postgres, cross-version and cross-distribution migrations as supported, for example from PostgreSQL 16 to 17 or from PostgreSQL 17 to EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17.

Source Postgres instances can be self-managed instances on bare metal machines, virtual machines, or they can be hosted by a cloud service provider like AWS (RDS or Aurora databases).

Postgres sources require a database role or user that can manage replications. For details, see [Preparing Postgres source databases](getting_started/preparing_db/preparing_postgres_source_databases.mdx).

## Supported destination databases

Data Migration Service supports migrating to both HM-managed databases (on clusters created with EDB Postgres AI Hybrid Control Plane) and self-managed databases running Postgres.

| Database version   | Supported destination |
| ------------------ | --------------------- |
| PostgreSQL 11 - 17 | Y                     |
| EPAS 11 - 17       | Y                     |
| PGE 11 - 17        | Y                     |

!!!note

    If the destination is an HM-managed database, AWS must be the provider for the Hybrid Control Plane cluster. Other Cloud Service providers are currently not supported.

### Oracle

The EDB DMS doesn't support migrations to Oracle destinations yet.

### Postgres

When migrating from Postgres towards Postgres, cross-version and cross-distribution migrations as supported, for example from PostgreSQL 16 to 17 or from PostgreSQL 17 to EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17.

Postgres destinations require a database role or user that can manage replications. For details, see [Preparing Postgres source databases](getting_started/preparing_db/preparing_postgres_source_databases.mdx).

## Supported operating systems

Both Reader and Writer run on Linux. For details, see [Installing EDB DMS Reader](getting_started/installing) or [Installing EDB DMS Writer](getting_started/installing2).
