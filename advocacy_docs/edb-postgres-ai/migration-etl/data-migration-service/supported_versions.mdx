## Supported source databases

The following database versions are supported.

| Database version | Supported |
|------------------|-----------|
| Postgres 11 - 16 | Y         |
| EPAS 11 - 16     | Y         |

### Oracle

The EDB DMS stack requires the Oracle database to have archive log mode enabled and supplemental logging data enabled at the table and database level. For details, see [Preparing Oracle source databases](getting_started/preparing_db/preparing_oracle_source_databases).

Container databases (CDB/PDB) and non-CDB sources are supported.

### Postgres/EDB Postgres Advanced Server

Postgres and EDB Postgres Advanced Server sources require a database role or user that can manage replications. For details, see [Preparing Postgres source databases](getting_started/preparing_db/preparing_postgres_source_databases).

## Supported target databases 

Data Migration Service supports migrating to EDB Postgres AI Cloud Services. The target Postgres database cluster must meet the following requirements:

-   The cluster was deployed with the [EDB Hosted Cloud Service](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/planning/choosing_your_deployment/edb_hosted_cloud_service/).

-   AWS is the provider for the EDB Hosted Cloud Service cluster. 

!!!note
   Other Cloud Service providers and [Your Cloud Account](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/planning/choosing_your_deployment/your_cloud_account/) deployments are currently not supported.
