## EDB PostgresÂ® AI migrations powered by EDB Data Migration Service

EDB Data Migration Service (DMS) offers a secure and fault-tolerant way to migrate database data to the EDB Postgres AI platform. Using change data capture or CDC and event streaming, source database row changes are replicated to the migration destination. You can select a subset of your schemas' tables to migrate including support for schema, table, and column name remapping.

EDB Data Migration Service is built on Apache Kafka and the open-source Debezium CDC platform.

To migrate self-managed database sources you must download and configure the EDB DMS  Reader.
