**EDB Postgres® AI migrations powered by EDB Data Migration Service**

!!!note Notice
  Data Migration Service capabilities are now only available as part of the EDB Postgres AI Hybrid Control Plane, which is currently in tech preview.

EDB Data Migration Service (DMS) offers a secure and fault-tolerant way to migrate database data to the EDB Postgres AI platform. Using change data capture or CDC and event streaming, source database row changes are replicated to the migration destination. You can select a subset of your schemas' tables to migrate including support for schema, table, and column name remapping.

EDB DMS is currently a public preview capability that is available for use with EDB Hosted EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service deployments on AWS.

EDB Data Migration Service is built on Apache Kafka and the open-source Debezium CDC platform.

To migrate self-managed database sources, see [Getting started](./getting_started/).
