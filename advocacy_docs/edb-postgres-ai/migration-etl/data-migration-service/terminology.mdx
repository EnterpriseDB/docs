description: Learn some basic concepts associated with EDB Data Migration Service. 
---

This terminology is important to understand EDB Data Migration Service (DMS) functionality.

## Analytics Sync

EDB PostgresÂ® AI Analytics Sync is a type of replication/migration supported by EDB Data Migration Service. EDB Postgres Advanced Server and Postgres source database snapshots are transformed into Delta Lake format in CSP Object Storage. This object storage is exposed as Storage Locations in the EDB Postgres AI Console.

## Change Data Capture (CDC)

CDC is a set of software design patterns used to determine and track changes in data sets by calculating *deltas*. EDB Data Migration Service uses CDC to stream changes from a database cluster to another. 

## EDB DMS Reader

The [EDB Data Migration Service Reader](./getting_started/installing/), packaged as `cdcreader`, uses Debezium to perform CDC operations on the source database and Kafka to produce messages containing the change events.

Install and configure the DMS Reader when performing any type of migrations, as it allows you to connect to and read the source. If the target for your migration is an HCP-managed database, you don't need to install the [DMS Writer](#edb-dms-writer). If the target is another self-managed database, install the [DMS Writer](#edb-dms-writer).

## EDB DMS Writer

The [EDB Data Migration Service Writer](./getting_started/installing2/), packaged as `cdcwriter`, uses Debezium to perform CDC operations on the destination database and Kafka to produce messages containing the change events.

Install and configure the DMS Writer on your destination machine when performing migrations to self-managed destination databases, as it allows you to connect to self-managed destinations. Additionally install the [DMS Reader](#edb-dms-reader) for any type of migrations.

### Apache Kafka

[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is an open-source, distributed-event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications. EDB Data Migration Service uses Kafka to manage data streaming from the source to the target database.

### Debezium

[Debezium](https://debezium.io/) is a Java-based, open-source platform for CDC that is supported by the Red Hat community. The EDB DMS Reader uses Debezium to perform reading operations and capture data changes on the source database.
