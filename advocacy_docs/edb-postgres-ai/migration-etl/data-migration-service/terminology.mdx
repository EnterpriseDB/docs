description: Learn some basic concepts associated with EDB Data Migration Service. 
---

This terminology is important to understand EDB Data Migration Service (DMS) functionality.

## Analytics Sync

EDB PostgresÂ® AI Analytics Sync is a type of replication/migration supported by EDB Data Migration Service. EDB Postgres Advanced Server and Postgres source database snapshots are transformed into Delta Lake format in CSP Object Storage. This object storage is exposed as Storage Locations in the EDB Postgres AI Console.

## Change Data Capture (CDC)

CDC is a set of software design patterns used to determine and track changes in data sets by calculating *deltas*. EDB Data Migration Service uses CDC to stream changes from a database cluster to another. 

## EDB DMS Reader

The [EDB Data Migration Service Reader](./getting_started/installing/), packaged as `cdcreader`, uses Debezium to perform CDC operations on the source database and Kafka to produce messages containing the change events.

### Apache Kafka

[Apache Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/) is an open-source, distributed-event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications. EDB Data Migration Service uses Kafka to manage data streaming from the source to the target database.

### Debezium

[Debezium](https://debezium.io/) is a Java-based, open-source platform for CDC that is supported by the Red Hat community. The EDB DMS Reader uses Debezium to perform reading operations and capture data changes on the source database.
