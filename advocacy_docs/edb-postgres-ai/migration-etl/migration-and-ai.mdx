EDB PostgresÂ® AI Tools Migration Portal offers an [AI copilot](/migration_portal/latest/03_mp_using_portal/mp_ai_copilot/) to assist users who are migrating their databases to EDB Postgres. 
The AI copilot is an AI-driven chatbot tool that helps users with the migration process. 
The AI copilot is designed to help users with the following tasks:

- **General migration assistance**: The AI copilot can help users with general migration questions. 
  For example, users can request information about available tools, and source and target database compatibility.
- **Migration planning**: The AI copilot can help users plan their migration, and obtain an overview of the end-to-end migration paths.
- **Migration assessment**: The AI copilot can help users assess their migration readiness. 
  For example, if there are compatibility issues between source and target databases, the AI Copilot can suggest compatible query alternatives. 

The AI copilot is designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. Users can interact with the AI copilot using natural language and improve the quality of answers with [good prompting](/migration_portal/latest/03_mp_using_portal/mp_ai_copilot/ai_good_prompts/). The AI copilot is also designed to be context-aware, so it can provide users with relevant information based on the context of the conversation.
