This section shows how you can use your [newly installed pgai tech preview](../install-tech-preview/) to retrieve and generate AI data in Postgres.

* [Working with AI data in Postgres](working-with-ai-data-in-postgres) details how to use the pgai extension to work with AI data stored in Postgres tables.
* [Working with AI data in S3](working-with-ai-data-in-S3/) covers how to use the pgai extension to work with AI data stored in S3 compatible object storage.
* [Standard encoders](additional_functions/#supported-encoders) goes through the standard encoder LLMs that are supported by the pgai extension.
