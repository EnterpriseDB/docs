At the heart of EDB Postgres AI is the EDB Postgres AI database. This builds on Postgres's flexibility and extends its capability to include store the vector data of embeddings.

## What is vector data?

To be able to deterimine similarity between things, we need to be able to represent them in a way that allows us to compare them. This is where vector data comes in, as it reduces the complexity of an thing to a set of numbers that can be compared. Those numbers could  be derived from a set of images of the thing, a set of words about it or even a set of sounds. Each number exists on a dimension of the vector and vectors can have as many dimensions at they need to fully repreent a thing.

## What are embeddings?

These sets of values for the dimensions are called embeddings. Once we have embeddings for real world object, or images or text, we can compare them to see how similar they are across all the aspects represented by the embeddings dimensions. This comparison a core operation performed by machine learning and artificial intelligence models to work out connections between things.

## How are embeddings created?

Embeddings can be created manually, by experts who understand the thing to be represented. This is expensive and doesn't scale. The other option is for it to be created automatically by machine learning models, which can be initially trained by experts. These models are then trained on a set of data that represents the thing to be embedded, and then the model is used to generate the embeddings. The model is tuned by adjusting the values of the embeddings until the model can predict the thing accurately.

## How are embeddings stored in a database?

Embeddings, as sets of numbers, are not easily stored in a traditional relational database. They are best stored in a database that is designed to handle them. This is where EDB Postgres AI comes in. Building on the popular PG/Vector extension, EDB Postgres AI extends the capabilities of Postgres to handle vector data, and then provides the tools and utilties you need to build and deploy machine learning and artificial intelligence models.

## What can I do with EDB Postgres AI?

In the coming months, we'll be adding more content to this site to help you get started with EDB Postgres AI. We'll be covering how to create embeddings, how to train models and how to deploy them. We'll also be covering how to use the models in your applications, and how to monitor and manage them. We'll also be covering how to scale your models and how to use them in a production environment.
