description: How Model Library works within Hybrid Manager and how to manage model images.
---

Hybrid Manager uses **Model Library**, powered by the HCP Image Library, to manage and deploy AI model images.

You can use the Model Library to:

- Discover available NIM models.
- Integrate your own private registries.
- Manage metadata for model images.

---

## Hybrid Manager considerations

- Model Library in Hybrid Manager overlays **HCP Image Library**.
- Images can be deployed as KServe InferenceServices within your project.
- Repository configuration is project-scoped.
- You can add your own image registries:
