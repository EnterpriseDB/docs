The **AI Factory workload** in Hybrid Manager brings scalable AI, machine learning, and Gen AI capabilities to your Hybrid Manager platform. It enables you to operationalize AI across your Hybrid Manager-managed clusters and data — with deep integration across Postgres, vector search, model serving, and AI assistants.

With AI Factory in Hybrid Manager, you can:

- **Deploy Gen AI assistants and agents** for internal or external-facing use
- **Serve AI models at scale** with integrated KServe-powered inferencing and GPU acceleration
- **Create Knowledge Bases** and perform **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** with vector search
- **Manage your model library** and deploy trusted models under Hybrid Manager governance
- **Integrate AI features** directly into your applications and data pipelines

For in-depth architecture and core concepts, see the [AI Factory Hub](/ai-factory).

## Example AI Solutions You Can Build

AI Factory in Hybrid Manager enables solutions across many domains:

- **Enterprise search and knowledge assistants**
Build RAG-based assistants that integrate with corporate documents, databases, and intranet content.

- **Customer support chatbots**
Deploy assistants powered by your own data and domain-specific models, combining conversational AI with Knowledge Bases.

- **AI-driven data apps**
Expose AI-powered endpoints for apps — semantic search, recommendations, similarity search, or natural language querying.

- **Operational AI for internal tools**
Build AI agents and tools to assist with DevOps, customer success, HR automation, sales enablement, and more.

- **Domain-specific model serving**
Serve proprietary or fine-tuned models (LLMs, embedding models, ranking models) as scalable inference services within your Hybrid Manager cluster.

You can start small — with a single assistant or model endpoint — and scale to full AI-powered applications using the AI Factory architecture.
