**Agent Studio** in Hybrid Manager provides an integrated way to create and manage AI Assistants.

You can use Agent Studio to build agents that access models, knowledge bases, and tools—all running within the Hybrid Manager project infrastructure.

## How it works in Hybrid Manager

- Assistants run in your project’s Kubernetes cluster.
- Assistants can call **models deployed via Model Serving**.
- Assistants can retrieve data from **Knowledge Bases** built within the same project.
- Assistants can call **Tools** implemented in your environment.
