**Gen AI Builder** in **Hybrid Manager** enables you to build advanced **agentic AI applications** — fully aligned with your **Sovereign AI** architecture — with complete control over data, models, and application behavior.

Builder applications run as containers in your project’s Kubernetes cluster and interact with:

- **KServe-powered Model Serving** endpoints
- **Knowledge Bases** built in your Hybrid Manager project
- **Tools** and **Structures** for executing business logic and accessing external systems

> For a deeper background, see the [Gen AI Builder concepts page](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/explained/ai-factory-concepts) in the AI Factory hub and [Gen AI Builder hub reference](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder).

## How Gen AI Builder works in Hybrid Manager

- Gen AI Builder applications run in your project’s **Kubernetes cluster** — no external compute dependencies required.
- Builders can call **models deployed via Model Serving** — see [Model Serving](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/model/serving).
- Builders retrieve content from **Knowledge Bases** built in your Hybrid Manager project — see [Knowledge Bases explained](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/explained/knowledge-bases-explained).
- Builders invoke **Tools** implemented within your project — see [Tools explained](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/explained/tools-explained).
- Builders manage **Threads** to enable stateful, auditable conversations — see [Threads explained](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/explained/threads-explained).
- Builders can leverage **Rulesets** to enforce governance and behavioral consistency — see [Rulesets explained](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/explained/rulesets-explained).

## Key Hybrid Manager considerations

- Builder applications run on **GPU-enabled infrastructure** when required for high-performance inference — [Update GPU Resources](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/how-to/model-serving/update-gpu-resources).
- Builders access **KServe-based Model Serving** endpoints deployed within your Hybrid Manager project — [Deploy AI Models](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/how-to/model-serving/deploy-nim-container).
- Builders can access **Knowledge Bases** that are created within the project — see [AI Accelerator Knowledge Base page](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/pipeline/knowledge_base/)
- Builders operate entirely within your Hybrid Manager environment — supporting **Sovereign AI** principles:
- Your data
- Your models
- Your AI pipelines
- Full observability and control

See [Sovereign AI explained](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/explained/sovereign-ai).

## Typical Gen AI Builder flow in Hybrid Manager

1. Build or deploy **Tools** — [How-To: Create a Tool](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/how-to/gen-ai/create-tool).
2. Create and configure **Knowledge Bases** — [How-To: Create a Knowledge Base](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/how-to/gen-ai/create-knowledge-base).
3. Deploy supporting **models** via Model Serving — [How-To: Deploy a NIM container](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/how-to/model-serving/deploy-nim-container).
4. Configure **Rulesets** as needed — [How-To: Create a Ruleset](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/how-to/gen-ai/create-ruleset).
5. Build **Assistants** and/or **agent workflows** using Gen AI Builder — [Gen AI Builder hub reference](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder).
6. Monitor **Threads** and tune behavior — [How-To: View Threads](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/how-to/gen-ai/view-threads).
