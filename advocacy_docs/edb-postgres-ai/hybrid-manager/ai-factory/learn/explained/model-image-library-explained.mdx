description: Understand the Image and Model Library in Hybrid Manager, powering both database images and AI model images through a unified architecture.
---

The **Image and Model Library** is a core capability of the Hybrid Manager (HM).
It provides a unified, governed repository for managing container images across your entire Hybrid Manager environment.

This includes:

- **Database images** → for PostgreSQL cluster provisioning.
- **AI model images** → for Model Serving (via AI Factory Model Library).

## Why a single library?

Using a unified Image and Model Library ensures:

- **Governance** → all images (DB or AI model) pass through the same approval flow.
- **Consistency** → the same agent-driven sync pulls images from container registries.
- **Security** → private registry integration applies equally to all image types.
- **Flexibility** → both database and AI teams can manage images within a common framework.

## What is the difference between Image Library and Model Library?

| Capability                    | Image and Model Library (Hub)                   | Model Library (AI Factory)                     |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Scope                         | All container images used in HCP                | Subset: AI model images used for Model Serving |
| Primary Users                 | DB admins, platform teams, AI teams             | AI Factory users, AI engineers                 |
| Backed by Container Registry? | Yes                                             | Yes (via Image Library)                        |
| Supports Private Registries?  | Yes                                             | Yes (via Image Library)                        |
| Source of Truth               | Container Registry → Image Library              | Filtered view of Image Library                 |
| Usage                         | Postgres cluster provisioning, AI model serving | AI model serving only                          |
| UI Location                   | Image Library (HCP Portal)                      | Model Library (AI Factory UI)                  |

**Summary:**
→ The Model Library is powered by Image Library.
→ All images pass through Image Library first → Model Library presents a user-friendly view of AI model images.

## Architecture flow

```text
Container Registry → Image and Model Library →
→ Postgres Provisioning / AI Model Serving
→ Model Library UI → Model Serving
```

* Postgres provisioning consumes database images from Image Library.
* AI Factory Model Library consumes model images → curated from Image Library.

## Key Concepts

| Concept          | Meaning                                                      |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Repository       | A collection of images (ex: postgresql, meta/llama-3.3-49b)  |
| Tag              | A version of an image (ex: 17.4-2503310734, 1.8.5, latest)   |
| HCP Tags         | Organizational tags applied to image repos in HCP            |
| Repository Rules | Define which repos/tags to sync from connected registries    |
| Private Registry | Any customer-provided container registry integrated into HM |
| Beacon Agent     | Agent that pulls image metadata into Image Library           |

## Use Cases

### Database images

Provision new Postgres clusters using curated database images.

Support for:

- PostgreSQL Community.
- EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).
- EDB Postgres Extended Server (PGE).

Manage extensions via OCI annotations.

### AI model images

Deploy AI models using AI Factory → Model Serving (powered by KServe).

Support for:

- NVIDIA NIM model images.
- Future: customer-provided model images.

Model Library surfaces a curated view of AI model images from Image Library.

## Governance flow

Connect container registries → private or public.
Define Repository Rules → which repos/tags to sync.
Beacon Agent pulls images → Image Library populated.

Image Library available to:

- Postgres Provisioning flows.
- Model Library (for AI model serving).

Model Library filters Image Library → only AI models shown.

## Benefits

* Single governance model for all images.
* No bypass of security or compliance policies.
* Private registry integration → works equally for database and AI model images.
* Teams can manage their own repositories but operate within platform-wide visibility.
