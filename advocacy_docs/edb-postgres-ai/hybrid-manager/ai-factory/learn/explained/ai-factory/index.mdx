navTitle: AI Factory in Hybrid Manager Explained
description: How AI Factory features are implemented and used within Hybrid Manager, with links to deep conceptual content and Hybrid Manager-specific guidance.
---

This section explains how key **AI Factory** capabilities work in the context of **Hybrid Manager**.

Hybrid Manager delivers AI Factory as a managed **AI workload** within your Hybrid Manager (HCP) project.
This allows you to run **agentic AI applications**, deploy and serve **AI models**, and integrate **vector and knowledge-based search** — all with Kubernetes-native control and security.

---

## What this section covers

This section provides **Hybrid Manager-specific explanations** of AI Factory capabilities:

- How they run within HCP project Kubernetes clusters
- How they interact with other AI Factory features (Model Serving, Knowledge Bases, Agent Studio)
- How they interact with **Hybrid Manager features** (image management, GPU management, observability, user and project scopes)
- Where to find deep conceptual content in the **AI Factory Hub**
