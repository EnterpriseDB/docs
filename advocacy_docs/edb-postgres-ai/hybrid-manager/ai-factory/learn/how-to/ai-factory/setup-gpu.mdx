description: How to provision and configure GPU resources in Hybrid Manager to support Model Serving.
---

Use this guide to prepare GPU resources in your Hybrid Manager (HCP) Kubernetes cluster to support Model Serving with KServe.

You provision GPU-enabled nodes, configure them for KServe, and store required secrets for deploying NVIDIA NIM models.

## Goal

Prepare your HCP cluster to run GPU-based Model Serving workloads using KServe.

## Estimated time

20â€“40 minutes (provisioning might take longer depending on your cloud provider).

## What you accomplish

- Provision GPU node groups or node pools in your HCP cluster.
- Label and taint GPU nodes correctly.
- Deploy the NVIDIA device plugin DaemonSet.
- Store your NVIDIA API key as a Kubernetes secret.
- Enable your cluster to run NIM model containers in KServe.

## What this unlocks

After you complete this procedure, you can deploy supported GPU-accelerated models through Model Serving:

- For AIDB Knowledge Bases.
- For GenAI Builder assistants.
- For custom model-based applications.

## Prerequisites

- Access to an HCP Kubernetes cluster with appropriate permissions.
- Administrative access to provision node groups (AWS EKS / GCP GKE / RHOS).
- NVIDIA API key for accessing NIM models.
- Familiarity with basic `kubectl` usage.

## Provision GPU nodes

Provision GPU node groups (EKS) or node pools (GKE / RHOS) in your HCP cluster:

- Use instances with L40S or A100 GPUs (for example, `g6e.12xlarge` on AWS or `a2-highgpu-4g` on GCP).
- Recommended: Provision at least one node with four GPUs to support large models such as Llama 70B.

## Label and taint GPU nodes

Apply the following Kubernetes label and taint to GPU nodes.

Label:

```shell
kubectl label node <gpu-node-name> nvidia.com/gpu=true
````

Taint:

```shell
kubectl taint nodes <gpu-node-name> nvidia.com/gpu=true:NoSchedule
```

This ensures that KServe model pods are scheduled correctly and that Postgres clusters do not land on GPU nodes.

## Deploy the NVIDIA device plugin

Deploy the NVIDIA device plugin DaemonSet.

```shell
kubectl create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin/v0.14.1/nvidia-device-plugin.yml
```

Verify that the plugin is running.

```shell
kubectl get ds -n kube-system nvidia-device-plugin-daemonset
```

The plugin exposes GPU resources to Kubernetes and KServe.

## Store NVIDIA API key as Kubernetes secret

Generate an NVIDIA API key from the NGC Catalog portal.

Create a Kubernetes secret.

```shell
kubectl create secret generic nvidia-nim-secrets --from-literal=NGC_API_KEY=<your_NVIDIA_API_KEY>
```

This secret is required when deploying `ClusterServingRuntime` resources for NIM models.
