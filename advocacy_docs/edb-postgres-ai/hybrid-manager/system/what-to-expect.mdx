description: Understand the key milestones from system delivery through workload deployment and lifecycle support.

This page outlines the experience of receiving, setting up, and operating your Sovereign AI and Data Factory system during the first 90 days—from delivery through active use and support.

## Days 0–21: Site readiness and installation

After your order is confirmed, you'll complete a site readiness survey to guide installation. The survey includes:

- Power, rack, and cabling details
- Networking and security preferences
- Physical access and contact coordination

### What happens:

- Supermicro ships the full system to your selected data center.
- EDB and Supermicro teams perform on-site racking, power-up, and validation.
- Configuration is completed based on your preferences.
- You receive login credentials and URL access to the Hybrid Manager portal.

## Days 21–28: Deploying your first workloads

Once the system is live, you can immediately begin launching workloads. All operations take place through the Hybrid Manager interface.

### What you can do:

- Deploy a high-availability 3-node Postgres cluster.
- Launch embedding jobs and vector pipelines using Postgres and pgvector.
- Use GPU nodes to serve models locally via NVIDIA NIM containers.
- Create RAG-style applications and internal chatbots.

You don’t need to access Kubernetes directly—everything is managed through the UI.

## Days 28–90: Lifecycle management and scaling

As workloads evolve, the system is ready to scale and update with full lifecycle support from EDB and Supermicro.

### What’s included:

- Regular OS and software updates, including Postgres and AI tools.
- Optional expansion by adding compute or GPU nodes.
- Firmware, BIOS, and system health checks by Supermicro.
- Built-in observability and diagnostics across all layers.

You can continue operating the system through Hybrid Manager while both software and hardware remain covered under joint support agreements.
