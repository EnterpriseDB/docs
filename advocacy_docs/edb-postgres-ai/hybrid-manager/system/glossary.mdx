These key terms and architectural components are used throughout the Sovereign AI and Data Factory documentation.

### Administration node

The central control node of the system. Hosts the Hybrid Manager interface, authentication services, and orchestration logic.

### AI node

A GPU-enabled server used for model inference, vector processing, and agentic execution. Part of the optional AI workload configuration.

### Agentic workflow

A multi-step automation pattern where AI agents perform tasks independently using internal tools, memory, and feedback loops. Often built on top of LLMs and vector data.

### Control plane

The set of three Hybrid Manager nodes responsible for cluster scheduling, monitoring, lifecycle operations, and access control. Operates independently of data workloads.

### Compute node

A general-purpose high-performance node used for running Postgres clusters, analytics, or vector pipelines. Can be scaled out as needed.

### Embedding

The process of converting structured or unstructured data into vector representations suitable for AI workflows such as retrieval and classification.

### EDB Hybrid Manager

EDB’s management layer for orchestrating database and AI workloads in Kubernetes environments. Used to deploy clusters, monitor systems, and manage lifecycle operations.

### Inference

The act of generating output from a machine-learning model. In this system, inference is performed on dedicated GPU nodes using KServe and NVIDIA NIM containers.

### KServe

An open-source model serving framework used to run inference workloads. Integrated into Hybrid Manager and GPU nodes for serving LLMs and embedding models.

### Lifecycle services

Ongoing support and management for both hardware and software, including security patches, OS updates, Postgres upgrades, and firmware management.

### EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD)

EDB’s multi-node, high-availability Postgres solution. Optional for customers who require globally distributed or synchronous multi-region clusters.

### Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

A workload pattern where structured data (often in Postgres) is retrieved and passed to an LLM to generate natural language responses. Requires embedding and inference capabilities.

### Sovereign AI

An AI deployment model where all data, models, and execution environments remain physically and logically within a customer-controlled space that's fully air-gapped if needed.

### Vector store

A database or index that stores embedding vectors and supports similarity search. Postgres and pgvector are used in this system for local vector storage.
