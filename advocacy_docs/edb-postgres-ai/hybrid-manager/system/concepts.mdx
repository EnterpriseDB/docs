description: Key architecture concepts and components that make up the Sovereign AI and Data Factory system.
---


Sovereign AI and Data Factory combines physical infrastructure, orchestration software, and lifecycle automation into a single system, preassembled and installed in your data center.

Understanding the system architecture and core roles helps clarify how Postgres workloads and AI pipelines are deployed, managed, and scaled.

## Node types and roles

The system includes several node roles—each with distinct responsibilities and configurations.

### Administration node

The Administration Node is the entry point and control surface for your system. It hosts:

- The EDB Hybrid Manager web interface
- Authentication services
- Cluster orchestration
- Licensing and support tooling

All user access to Hybrid Manager flows through this node.

### Hybrid Manager nodes

Three Hybrid Manager nodes form a high-availability control plane. They manage Kubernetes scheduling, cluster lifecycle, observability, and API services.

Functions include:

- Managing database cluster deployments
- Monitoring 200+ metrics from Postgres, OS, and GPU workloads
- Coordinating updates and patches
- Serving configuration UIs and APIs

These nodes are not used for running data workloads.

### Compute nodes

Compute Nodes are used to run Postgres databases, analytics pipelines, or vector workloads. These nodes support:

- EDB Postgres Advanced Server or Extended Server
- EDB Postgres Distributed (optional)
- Lakehouse formats such as Apache Iceberg
- Python-based embedding or transformation pipelines

Storage is high-speed NVMe, with dual 100Gbps NICs for intra-node bandwidth.

### AI nodes (optional)

AI Nodes are GPU-enabled servers that support large-scale model inference and agentic execution. The system includes two types:

- **2-GPU Nodes** for mid-scale model serving (NVIDIA Ada L40S)
- **8-GPU Nodes** for LLM and agent runtime (NVIDIA HGX with B200 GPUs)

These nodes integrate with KServe to provide on-premises model serving and inference routing.

## Orchestration and lifecycle

The system runs a preinstalled Kubernetes cluster managed by Hybrid Manager. Customers do not directly access Kubernetes.

Instead, Hybrid Manager provides a web-based interface to:

- Deploy Postgres clusters (with high availability)
- Install and monitor vector pipelines or AI workflows
- Scale workloads to additional nodes
- Monitor performance and resource usage

EDB provides lifecycle services for both software and hardware:

- Major and minor version upgrades
- Security patches
- Hardware firmware and BIOS updates
- Automated cluster rebalancing and restart handling

## What is "sovereign"?

Sovereign in this context means:

- All data and models reside in your physical environment
- No external cloud dependencies or data sharing
- You own the hardware, and control network access
- Fully audit-ready, isolated environment for regulated industries

Sovereign AI and Data Factory is suitable for:

- Government or national data infrastructure
- Financial services subject to local data regulations
- Enterprises with strict cloud restrictions or sensitive IP

## Supported workload patterns

Each configuration supports a range of use cases:

Workload | Description | Core Compute | Advanced AI
---------|-------------|--------------|-------------
High availability Postgres | Run 3-node HA clusters | ✅ | ✅
Embeddings | Convert internal data into vector form | ❌ | ✅
Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) | Combine Postgres + LLMs | ❌ | ✅
Inference | Serve models locally using GPUs | ❌ | ✅
Agentic workflows | Build AI agents that act autonomously | ❌ | ✅

For configuration details, see [System Specifications](./specs).
