Selecting the right Postgres database cluster type when creating new clusters in the Hybrid Manager (HM) is crucial for optimizing your database environment. EDB offers a range of options, each tailored to different needs, from basic single-node deployments to highly resilient, distributed solutions.

## Distributed High Availability

Distributed High Availability (DHA) clusters are powered by EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) and leverage multi-master logical replication. This architecture enables true active-active solutions across multiple regions, providing the highest levels of availability and resilience.

**Who should pick this option?**

- Organizations requiring ultra-high availability and near-zero downtime.
- Applications that demand distributed deployments with low latency access for users.
- Businesses with mission-critical applications where continuous operation and data consistency across multiple active nodes are paramount.
- Scenarios requiring uninterrupted online database maintenance and in-place major version upgrades without impacting availability.

## Advanced High Availability

Advanced High Availability (AHA) focuses on delivering robust HA solutions beyond basic primary/standby setups, aiming for higher uptime guarantees and more sophisticated recovery mechanisms. This can encompass various enhanced HA configurations, often utilizing EDB's specialized tools and expertise to provide superior resilience. Unlike Distributed High Availability clusters, Advanced High Availability clusters use a single region and are designed to provide high availability within that region.

**Who should pick this option?**

- Teams preferring a simpler setup than Distributed High Availability that still leverages advanced EDB Postgres Distributed features and allows for future migration to full Distributed High Availability.
- Businesses that require a balance between complexity and high uptime, offering stronger resilience without the full multi-master distributed architecture.
- Enterprises needing enhanced high availability that surpasses standard primary/standby configurations.
- Organizations seeking to minimize downtime for planned maintenance and unplanned outages with more flexible deployment options.

## High Availability 

High availability (HA) primary/standby configurations typically involve a primary database server and one or more standby (replica) servers. The standby server(s) continuously receive data changes from the primary, ready to take over if the primary fails. This setup uses physical streaming replication.

**Who should pick this option?**

- Applications that require data durability and continuous service with minimal downtime, but where strict active-active multi-master is not a requirement.
- Use cases where read-heavy workloads can benefit from offloading queries to hot standby replicas.

## Single node

A single-node deployment consists of a single PostgreSQL database instance running without any standby or replica servers. This is the simplest configuration and is suitable for non-critical workloads or development environments.

**Who should pick this option?**

- Development and testing environments where high availability is not a concern.
- Non-critical applications that can tolerate downtime for maintenance, upgrading or in case of failure.
- Users who prioritize simplicity and minimal infrastructure cost above all else.
- Small-scale applications with low traffic and data volume.
