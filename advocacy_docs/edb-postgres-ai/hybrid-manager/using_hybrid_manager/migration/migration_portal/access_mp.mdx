The Migration Portal application of the Hybrid Manager offers two different workspaces, that are accessed differently depending on how you want to use it.

## Project-scoped workspace vs. user's workspace

When you deploy the Hybrid Manager, it automatically includes a built-in instance of Migration Portal. This instance, however, has two type of workspaces that vary depending on how you want to use it. They are also accessed differently.

-   The *project-scoped workspace* in the Migration Portal is where you manage Migration Portal (MP) projects created with the Hybrid Manager Console for schemas loaded by the [Agent](../migration_guides/agent_for_oracle_readiness.mdx).

    This shared portal environment aligns your MP projects directly with your Hybrid Manager (HM) projects. Here, you'll see all MP projects created by both yourself and other users who are part of the same HM project. You won't, however, see MP projects from migrations performed in other HM projects.

-   The *user's workspace* in the Migration Portal is where you create and manage migration projects for external schemas that you manually upload for analysis, conversion and migration. 

    This is not a shared environment, only your user will have access to the Migration Portal projects created in this workspace.

This separation allows the Migration Portal to cater to different types and scales of migration efforts: organized, large-scale, enterprise-driven projects (project-scoped) versus more flexible, smaller-scale, or individual-driven migrations (user's workspace).

## Accessing

A Migration Portal has two type of workspaces. How you access them depends on how you want to use the Migration Portal. 

-   To create and manage projects for schemas loaded into the Hybrid Manager by the Agent, see [Assessing schemas for HM projects](hm_schema_migration.mdx). This uses the project-scoped access to MP.

-   To manually upload externally-provided DDL files and assess schemas with the Migration Portal, see [Assessing schemas for external projects](external_schema_migration.mdx). This employs the user's workspace access to MP.
