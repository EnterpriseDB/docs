Migration Portal is a service that helps you assess, analyze, convert, and migrate Oracle database schemas to EDB Postgres Advanced Server. It is available as a web-based service or as an application in the Hybrid Manager. This documentation focuses on its usage as part of the Hybrid Manager.

## Hybrid Manager Migration Portal vs web-based Migration Portal 

Some features within the Hybrid Manager deployment of Migration Portal are unique or function differently compared to the web-based version.

### AI Copilot

!!!note

    You must manually enable this feature in the Hybrid Manager Migration Portal, whereas in the web-based version it's included out-of-the-box.

AI Copilot is an AI-driven chatbot tool, designed to assist you with issues that can occur during the schema assessment and conversion in the Migration Portal. It uses third-party AI services and is trained on both EDB's product documentation and support knowledge base to deliver use-case-specific solutions.

Unlike the Migration Portal, the AI Copilot is not enabled by default in the Hybrid Manager. 

-   To use the AI Copilot for Migration Portal queries, request the Hybrid Manager administrator to [enable and configure it with the AI/LLM of your organization](../../enabling_migration_copilot.mdx).

-   See [AI Copilot](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_portal/latest/03_mp_using_portal/mp_ai_copilot/) for more information.

### Project collaboration

!!!note

    The project collaboration feature is only available in the Hybrid Manager Migration Portal.

Migration Portal supports collaborative DDL editing, enabling multiple users in the same Hybrid Manager project to work on the same schema file simultaneously. If another user (user B) modifies a DDL you're also editing, your changes (user A) will trigger a conflict resolution view. This view displays user B's update in an **Update** view and your own edit in a **Target** view. You can then choose to **Use Updated** to adopt user B's fix or **Reassess** to apply and save your own changes, overwriting the previous update. This ensures efficient, concurrent schema compatibility adjustments.

### Portal access 

Accessing the Migration Portal interface differs based on the version you're using.

- The web-based Migration Portal is accessed through the [EDB portal](https://www.enterprisedb.com/accounts/login). 

- The Migration Portal built into the Hybrid Manager is accessed directly within the product. 
  - Use [project-scoped access](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migration_portal/hm_schema_migration/) to migrate schemas loaded by the Agent.
  - Use the [user's workspace access](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migration_portal/external_schema_migration/) to migrate externally provided schemas. 

### User permissions and role-based access

- The web-based Migration Portal provides each EDB account with a dedicated workspace, meaning projects cannot be shared with other users.

- The Migration Portal built into Hybrid Manager offers project-scoped, collaborative access. Users with access to a specific Hybrid Manager (HM) project automatically gain access to its associated Migration Portal project.

- In Hybrid Manager, Migration Portal user permissions are managed directly through Hybrid Manager. For instance, a user with **Viewer** permissions won't be able to migrate schemas or reassess DDL.
