Migration Portal is a service that helps you assess, analyze, convert, and migrate Oracle database schemas to EDB Postgres Advanced Server. It is available as a web-based service or as an application in the Hybrid Manager. This section focusses on its usage as part of the Hybrid Manager.

## Features

Some features within the Hybrid Manager deployment of Migration Portal are unique or function differently compared to the web-based version.

### AI Copilot

!!!note

    You must manually enable this feature in the Hybrid Manager Migration Portal, whereas in the web-based version it's included out-of-the-box.

AI Copilot is an AI-driven chatbot tool, designed to assist you with issues that can occur during the schema assessment and conversion in the Migration Portal. It uses third-party AI services and is trained on both EDB's product documentation and support knowledge base to deliver use-case-specific solutions.

Unlike the Migration Portal, the AI Copilot is not enabled by default in the Hybrid Manager. 

-   To use the AI Copilot for Migration Portal queries, request the Hybrid Manager administrator to [enable and configure it with the AI/LLM of your organization](../../enabling_migration_copilot.mdx).

-   See [AI Copilot](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_portal/latest/03_mp_using_portal/mp_ai_copilot/) for more information.

### SPL Check

!!!note

    This function is included in the Hybrid Manager Migration Portal. The web-based Migration Portal will include it in a future release as well.

SPL Check is a code analysis tool that identifies potential runtime errors in your Oracle procedural code. It's an important part of the assessment process when you're migrating to EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).

All schemas that are assessed with the Hybrid Manager version of Migration Portal are analyzed by SPL Check. This function, which is based on the [EDB SPL Check](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pg_extensions/spl_check/) extension, detects execution time errors within `FUNCTION`, `PROCEDURE`, `PACKAGE BODY`,`TYPE BODY`, and `TRIGGER` object types.

After the schemas are assessed, any objects that don't pass the check are marked as *failed* in the Migration Portal project, alongside other compatibility issues. This lets you resolve these problems before importing your objects into the destination database, preventing runtime errors later on.

You can distinguish SPL Check errors from other incompatibilities because they are prefixed with `[spl_check]`. After you modify an affected object to fix an issue, select **Reassess** to rerun the check and confirm your edits have resolved the problem.

### Project collaboration

!!!note

    This function is included in the Hybrid Manager Migration Portal. The web-based Migration Portal will include it in a future release as well.

Migration Portal supports collaborative DDL editing, enabling multiple users in the same Hybrid Manager project to work on the same schema file simultaneously. If another user (user B) modifies a DDL you're also editing, your changes (user A) will trigger a conflict resolution view. This view displays user B's update in an **Update** view and your own edit in a **Target** view. You can then choose to **Use Updated** to adopt user B's fix or **Reassess** to apply and save your own changes, overwriting the previous update. This ensures efficient, concurrent schema compatibility adjustments.
