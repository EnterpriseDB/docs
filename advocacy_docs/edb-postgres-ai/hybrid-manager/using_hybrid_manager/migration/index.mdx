How to migrate your database clusters.

-   For migrations from Oracle, use the Migration Portal instance built into the Hybrid Manager to [manage and convert schemas for HM migrations](migration_portal/hm_schema_migration.mdx). For migrations from Postgres, use Migration Toolkit, an external tool, to manage the [schema migration](migration_guides/self_managed_pg_to_hm_managed/migrating_schema.mdx). 

-   Use the [Data Migration Service](../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service) to perform either a snapshot or streaming replication of a self-managed database, and migrate it to an HM-managed database. 

See [Migration Guides](migration_guides) for end-to-end migration examples from Oracle, self-managed Postgres, AWS RDS and more.
