One of the main features of the Hybrid Manager is that it facilitates database migrations.

The **Migrations** tab that is accesible through the **Estate** page displays a list of external databases you have registered with the [Agent](../../monitoring#enabling-database-monitoring). 

This is your first stop when migrating external databases to the Hybrid Manager.

## Migrations table

### Default columns

The default view of the table contains the following information for each analyzed database: 

**Database Name:** Name of the assessed database.

**Database Type:** Database type. See [Compatibility](compatibility.mdx) for currently supported database types.

**Resource ID:** Resource ID or `databases.resource_id` you assigned to a database in the `beacon_agent.yaml` configuration. See the Agent's [Parameter reference](../../monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/configure_agent.mdx#parameter-reference) for more information.

**Version:** Database version. See [Compatibility](compatibility.mdx) for currently supported versions.

**# of Schemas:** Number of schemas in the assessed database that the DSN user has access to and, contains at least one table on which the DSN user has `SELECT` privileges. The DSN user is the source database user you specified during the configuration of the Agent.

!!!note s

   -   In Oracle databases, built-in `SYS` and `SYSTEM` schemas are excluded from the column count.

   -   The DSN user's schema is usually excluded if it has no tables, but a known issue can cause it to be included when the DDL extractor creates temporary tables during extraction.

   -   The Agent detects schema changes to tables and columns while running. However, changes to views or procedures won't be detected until you restart the Agent.

**# or Cores:** Number of cores allocated to the Oracle database.

**Complexity:** Level of complexity to migrate the database to the Hybrid Manager. Possible values are Very Easy, Easy, Medium, Hard, and Very Hard.

-   **Very Easy:** The Oracle schema doesn't contain incompatible features or objects, and the data model is fully compatible with EDB Postgres Advanced Server. 

-   **Easy:** The migration is relatively straightforward. The database structure and features are compatible, and require minimal adjustment. 

-   **Medium:** Requires moderate migration effort. Some database structures or features may require modification to get similar functionality in EDB Postgres Advanced Server. 

-   **Hard:** Requires significant effort and expertise. The database structures, features or custom code in Oracle have significant differences or complexities that will need to be addressed during the migration. 

-   **Very hard:** The migration is highly complex and demanding. Substantial differences in structures, features, and custom code between the Oracle and EDB Postgres Advanced Server databases require expertise so data, objects, and statements can be transformed. The code might have to be rewritten, or architectural redesign may be required.

**Migration LoE:** Level of effort, in 8-hour working days, required to convert the schema and migrate data to the Hybrid Manager. The estimation corresponds to the effort applied by members of EDBâ€™s professional services who specialize in Oracle to Postgres migrations. This value considers database and schema-level assessments that include database features, schema complexity, data volume and other factors to estimate the number of days.

### Other columns

You can use the gear icon to display additional columns: 

**Last assessed:** Period of time that has transcurred since the database was last assessed to determine if the analysis is up-to-date.

**Management:** Shows whether the database is managed by yourself (self-managed), by a clud service provider or by the Hybrid Manager.

**Project Name:** Project that was used for the configuration of the agent. It is the project you assign to an agent in `agent.project_id`. See the Agent's [Parameter reference](../../monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/configure_agent.mdx#parameter-reference) for more information.

**Tags:** Labels assigned to the migration of a specific database in `databases.tags`. See the Agent's [Parameter reference](../../monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/configure_agent.mdx#parameter-reference) for more information.

**TDS:** Total database size in GB. This includes database data only. Plan some additional space in the migration destination databases for metaobjects, temp and log files, etc.

## Viewing and filtering the migrations table view

The **Estate** > **Migration** tab displays a table-based analysis of all databases that you can migrate with the Hybrid Manager after registering it with the agent. To customize how assessment results are displayed or filter databases, you can:

-   Enter a keyword to search for specific databases. The **Search** function uses the keyword to display databases with matching **Resource ID**, **Project Name** and **Database Type** values.

-   Use the **Filter** selector to display databases by **Postgres Version** and **Project Name**.

-   Order the results by newest to oldest, oldest to newest, and also alphabetically.

-   Choose how often to refresh the table with the lightning icon. If disabled, the table won't be updated unless you manually refresh it. If **Auto refresh** is enabled, it will update the table every 30 seconds. Alternatively, you can select one of the preconfigured intervals.

-   Customize the columns displayed in the **Migrations** tab using the gear icon. You can also reset the columns to the default state. 

-   Adjust the size of the table to your screen.
