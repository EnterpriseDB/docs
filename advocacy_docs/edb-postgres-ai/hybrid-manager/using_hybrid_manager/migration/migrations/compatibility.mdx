Currently, the Hybrid Manager supports the assessment of these **Oracle** databases: 

-   Oracle 11g
-   Oracle 12c
-   Oracle 18c
-   Oracle 19c

Later versions (e.g., 21c, 23c) might also be assessed, but these versions have not been certified yet. 

**Postgres** databases are also displayed in the **Estate** > **Migrations** view, however, assessments arenâ€™t supported yet.
