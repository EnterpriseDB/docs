_Destinations_ are databases you connected to the Hybrid Manager using the EDB DMS Writer so you can use them for migrations.

To verify a destination has been recognized by the EDB DMS Writer and is available for a migration: 

1.  In your HM Console, select the project you are using for the current migration. 

1.  From the left navigation menu, select **Migrate** > **Destinations**.

Each destinations's view shows the database name, database type, `cdcwriter` ID, the current status, the destination type, and more.
