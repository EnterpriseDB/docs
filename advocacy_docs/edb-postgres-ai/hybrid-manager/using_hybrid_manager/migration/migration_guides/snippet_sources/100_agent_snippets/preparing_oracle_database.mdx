Registering an Oracle database with the Agent provides migration assessment and schema extraction capabilities.

To assess an Oracle database, the Agent needs an Oracle user with access to the database and the necessary permissions to retrieve assessment data. These permissions are required for automated schema extraction and database migration assessment. The Agent will still function if these roles arenâ€™t assigned, however, the agent will function in reduced feature capacity.

1.  Ensure the Oracle user you'll use to perform the assessment has access to these resources:

    ```
    V$VERSION
    V$INSTANCE
    V$LICENSE
    sys.all_tables
    sys.all_tab_privs
    ```

1.  The user must have `CREATE TABLE` permission, and it must also have _at least one_ of the following permissions:

    ```
    SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE
    SELECT ANY DICTIONARY
    ```

You will later specify this user in the `provider.onprem.databases.dsn` section of the Agent configuration file.
