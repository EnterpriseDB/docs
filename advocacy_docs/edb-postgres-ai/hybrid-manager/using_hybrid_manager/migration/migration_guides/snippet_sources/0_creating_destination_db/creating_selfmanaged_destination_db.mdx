You can use existing databases as destinations for migrations. To use an existing instance as a destination for the migration, ensure the tables you migrate and the load generated on the destination don't interfere with existing workloads.

If you don't have a self-managed destination database yet, create one that the EDB DMS Writer can connect to for HM migrations. This example assumes you have installed the Postgres database distribution of your choice and initilized the server.

1.  Connect to the destination Postgres server:

    ```shell
    psql -p <PG_PORT> -U <PG_USERNAME>
    ```

1.  Create an empty destination database that you'll use as a destination for the migration. 

    In this example, the destination database is called `tr_target`: 

    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE tr_target;
    ```
