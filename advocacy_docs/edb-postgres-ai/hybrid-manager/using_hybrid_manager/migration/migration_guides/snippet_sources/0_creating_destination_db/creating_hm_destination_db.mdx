## Create new database

If you don't have a destination database cluster on the HM yet, create one that the HM can use as destination for migrations:

1.  In the HM Console, select the [project](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/projects/#creating-projects) where you want to create the database cluster.

1.  Within your project, select **Create New** and **Database Cluster** to [create an instance](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/creating_cluster/) that will serve as destination for the EDB Data Migration Service (EDB DMS).

1.  In the **Clusters** page, select your cluster, and use the **Quick Connect** option to access your instance from your terminal.

1.  Create a new empty database that you will use as a destination for the migration. Alternatively, you can use the default database `edb_admin`.

## Use existing database

Alternatively, you can use an existing HM-managed database as destination for your migration. Before you use an existing instance as a destination for the migration, ensure the tables you migrate and the load generated on the destination don't interfere with existing workloads.

If you want to use an existing HM-managed database as destination, you can continue with the next step.
