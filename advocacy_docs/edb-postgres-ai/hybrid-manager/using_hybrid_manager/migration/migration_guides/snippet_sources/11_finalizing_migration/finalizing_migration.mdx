navTitle: Finalizing migration

---

If you selected the [**Snapshot + Streaming**](/edb-postgres-ai/migration-etl/data-migration-service/terminology/#snapshot--streaming-migration) option when creating a migration, the EDB DMS Reader will continue to stream any data updates performed on the source database to the destination database until you mark the migration as completed (for example, to perform a cutover).

If you selected the [**Snapshot**](/edb-postgres-ai/migration-etl/data-migration-service/terminology/#snapshot-migration) option, you can skip this page, as the DMS will automatically mark the migration as completed after it finishes copying the entire snapshot to the destination.

## Stop the streaming process

For [**Snapshot + Streaming**](/edb-postgres-ai/migration-etl/data-migration-service/terminology/#snapshot--streaming-migration) migrations only. 

It is important that you carefully select the best time to stop the data migration stream. Ensure no new inserts are executed in the source and verify that the last known inserts have been synchronized in the destination.

After checking that your data is present in the destination database you can stop the stream by marking the migration as completed.

1.  In the HM Console, in your project, select **Migrate** > **Migrations**.

2.  Select the **check icon** next to your migration to mark the migration as completed.

    Alternatively, select the migration from the list to open the [Migration details page](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migrations/migration_database_details_view/), and select **Mark as Completed**.

This stops the streaming procedure.
