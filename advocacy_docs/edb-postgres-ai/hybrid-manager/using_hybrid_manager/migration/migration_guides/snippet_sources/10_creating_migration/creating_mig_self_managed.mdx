navTitle: Creating migration

---

After you have configured the EDB DMS Reader and Writer to establish connections to Hybrid Manager (HM), create a new migration in the HM Console. A migration establishes a sync between the source database and a destination database with the help of EDB DMS.

1.  In the HM Console, select the project from which you want to manage the migration.

2.  Within your project, select **Migrate** > **Migrations**. 

3.  In the **Migrations** page, select **Create New Migration**. 

4.  In the **Create OLTP Migration** page, assign a **Name** to the migration. 

5.  Select the **Source** of the migration. The ID for the EDB DMS Reader is listed in the drop-down menu.

6.  Select the migration type, [**Snapshot**](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/terminology/#snapshot-migration) or [**Snapshot + Streaming**](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/terminology/#snapshot--streaming-migration).

7.  Under **Destination Type**, select a self-managed instance as destination for the migration. Then, select **Next**.

8.  Select the tables and columns to migrate. Modify the table and column names if needed.

9.  Select **Create Migration**.

The HM Console now displays a new migration.

If you chose the **Snapshot + Streaming** option, the EDB DMS Reader and Writer are constantly streaming data when the migration displays the **Running** state. Changes to data are replicated from the source to the destination database as long as the migration is running. 

!!!note

    The EDB DMS Reader streams data changes. It does not stream changes in the DDL objects.
