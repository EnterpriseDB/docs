navTitle: Agent for Oracle Migration Readiness

---

Before starting a migration from an Oracle database source, connect it to the Hybrid Manager with the Agent. Registering the Oracle database with the Agent gives you access to the following resources: 

-   A migration assessment, which provides a summarized view of database schema count, core count, migration complexity, and level of effort. It is available on the [**Migrations** tab](../migrations/) of the **Estate** page. 

-   A migration database [detailed view](../migrations/migration_database_details_view.mdx), which provides an expanded analysis of **Schemas**, a global and more detailed **Assessment**, as well as a **Migrations** hub that provides direct connections to other tools in the Console that will help you perform migrations. These resources are available when you select a specific Oracle database from the **Estate** page > **Migrations** tab.

-   Automatic schema DDL extraction that you can leverage to perform schema migrations with the built-in Migration Portal.

## Prepare the Oracle database

The Agent needs an Oracle user with access and necessary permissions to the source database to assess an Oracle database, extract schemas and other information needed for the migration.

See [Prepare your Oracle instance](../../monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/prepare_database.mdx#prepare-your-oracle-instance) for instructions.

## Create a machine user

The Agent requires a machine user to ingest data into the Hybrid Manager. 

See [Creating a machine user](../../monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/create_machine_user.mdx) for instructions.

## Install the Agent

[Install the Agent](../../monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/install_agent.mdx) on a machine that has access to the Oracle database.

## Configure the Agent

[Configure the Agent](../../monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/configure_agent.mdx) to allow your Oracle database to connect to your Hybrid Manager and fetch migration data from the source database, as well as schema DDL.

## Run the Agent

Once the Agent has been installed and configured, you can proceed to [running the Agent](../../monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/run_agent.mdx) and [running it as a service](../../monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/run_as_service.mdx). 

To maintain an uninterrupted connection to Hybrid Manager, you should run the Agent as a service. While manual execution can sustain a connection as long as the host machine is operational, running the Agent as a service ensures automatic system startup and restarts after unforeseen shutdowns.

If you don't set up the agent as a service, it will only perform assessments and stream schema data when you manually run it. Furthermore, by default, your database will disappear from the Hybrid Manager's **Estate** 72 hours after the agent stops streaming.

!!!important

    The Agent detects schema changes to tables and columns while running. However, changes to views or procedures won't be detected until you restart the Agent.

## Next steps

Once your Agent is running, refer to [Migrate your Oracle database to the Hybrid Manager](oracle_to_pg.mdx) for next steps.
