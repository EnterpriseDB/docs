navTitle: Postgres to HM-managed Postgres

To migrate a self-managed Postgres database to a database cluster created with the PG AI Hybrid Manager: 

1.  [Deploy the EDB DMS Reader](pg_to_pg.mdx#deploy-the-edb-dms-reader)
2.  [Create a destination database cluster managed by the PG AI Hybrid Manager](pg_to_pg.mdx#create-a-destination-database-cluster-managed-by-the-pg-ai-hybrid-manager)
3.  [Prepare the Postgres source databases so the EDB DMS Reader can access data](pg_to_pg.mdx#prepare-the-postgres-source-databases-so-the-edb-dms-reader-can-access-data)
4.  [Configure the EDB DMS Reader](pg_to_pg.mdx#configure-the-edb-dms-reader)
5.  [Run the EDB DMS Reader](pg_to_pg.mdx#run-the-edb-dms-reader)
6.  [Prepare the source schema and import it to the target database](pg_to_pg.mdx#prepare-the-source-schema-and-import-it-to-the-target-database)
7.  [Create a migration](pg_to_pg.mdx#create-a-migration)

## Deploy the EDB DMS Reader

Deploying the EDB DMS Reader on an a machine that has access to your database server allows the Reader to perform a connection between the Postgres database and the PG AI Hybrid Manager so it is recognized as a source for migration.

See [Installing the Data Migration Service Reader](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/getting_started/installing) for more information.

## Create a destination database cluster managed by the PG AI Hybrid Manager

When you migrate a database to the PG AI Hybrid Manager, you need to create an EDB Postgres Advanced Server database cluster. You'll target this database later when performing the [schema migration](pg_to_pg.mdx#prepare-the-source-schema-and-import-it-to-the-target-database), as this cluster will serve as a migration destination.

For more information, see [Creating a database cluster](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/getting_started/create_database.mdx).

## Prepare the Postgres source databases so the EDB DMS Reader can access data

See [Preparing Postgres source databases](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/getting_started/preparing_db/preparing_postgres_source_databases.mdx) for more information.

## Configure the EDB DMS Reader

To configure the EDB DMS Reader so the PG AI Hybrid Manager has access to source database data, you need to fill in some values in the reader script that give it access to both the source and target databases for migration. 

1.  Obtain credentials from the **PG AI Hybrid Manager Console** as explained in [Getting credentials](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/getting_started/config_reader.mdx#getting-credentials).

2.  Perform the steps in the [Configuring the reader](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/getting_started/config_reader.mdx#configuring-the-reader) section, but ensure you set the following variables set in the reader script:

    ```shell
    export CLOUD_PROVIDER=appliance
    export RW_SERVICE_HOST=<transporter-rw-service-host>
    ```

    !!!note

        Set `RW_SERVICE_HOST` to the domain name or host associated with the PG AI Hybrid Manager ingress.

        Derive `RW_SERVICE_HOST` from the `TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME` you assigned to your instance via the `values.yaml` file during installation and add `/transporter`.

        Alternatively, derive `RW_SERVICE_HOST` from the URL you use to access the PG AI Console. For example, if the URL is `https://portal-transporter.foo.network`, get the domain name, and add `/transporter` at the end.

        In this example, you'd have to set:

        `export RW_SERVICE_HOST=transporter.foo.network/transporter`

## Run the EDB DMS Reader

[Execute the EDB DMS Reader](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/getting_started/config_reader.mdx#running-the-edb-dms-reader) to start reading the source database. This doesn't perform a migration yet, only ensures the DMS has access and can read the source database.

## Prepare the source schema and import it to the target database

This step is not dependent on the previous steps, so it can be performed at any time before creating a migration. You must ensure the schema is converted and migrated to the target database before you [create a data migration](pg_to_pg.mdx#create-a-migration).

There are many tools EDB offers to prepare the schema. For migrations from self-managed Postgres instances, we recommend using EDB Migration Toolkit (MTK). [MTK's offline migration](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_toolkit/latest/07_invoking_mtk/08_mtk_command_options/#offline-migration-options) capability provides an easy way to extract a database's schema and separate constraints.

!!!note

    Ensure you exclude foreign key, check, and exclusion constraints from the DDL before importing the schema to the target database. Review [Schema integrity and performance considerations](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/getting_started/prepare_schema.mdx#schema-integrity-and-performance-considerations) to learn more about why constraints must be disabled and to review other considerations. 

## Create a migration

In the PG AI Console: 

1.  [Create a migration](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/getting_started/create_migration.mdx). 

2.  Verify that the migration was successful. You can perform spot checks of tables, rows, schemas, etc., with psql, or compare both databases with [LiveCompare](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/livecompare/latest/).

3.  If you selected a **Snapshot + Replication** migration, [mark the migration as completed](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/getting_started/mark_completed.mdx). Otherwise, skip this step.

4.  [Re-apply any excluded constraints](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/getting_started/apply_constraints.mdx).
