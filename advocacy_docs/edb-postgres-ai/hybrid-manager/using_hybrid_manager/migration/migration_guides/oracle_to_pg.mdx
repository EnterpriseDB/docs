Migrating a self-managed Oracle database to a HM-managed cluster involves several procedures. This guide collects all procedures in a single place, with links to the instructions for each procedure.

## Register your Oracle database

Registering the Oracle database with the Agent provides a migration assessment, as well as DDL schema extraction to be used by the Migration Portal.

Refer to [Using the Agent for Oracle Migration Readiness](agent_for_oracle_readiness.mdx) to register your Oracle database.

## Prepare the Oracle source databases

You prepared your Oracle database to allow the Agent to fetch monitoring metrics, migration statistics and schemas. Now you'll have to prepare it to allow the DMS Reader to fetch database data and perform migrations. See [Preparing Oracle source databases](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/getting_started/preparing_db/preparing_oracle_source_databases.mdx) for more information.

## Create an HM-managed destination

When migrating a database to an HM-managed database cluster, we recommend choosing EDB Postgres Advanced Server due to its superior Oracle compatibility. If your schema has minimal compatibility issues, you can also opt for PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Extended Servers. You'll choose destination this database later when performing the schema migration, as this cluster will serve as a migration destination.

[Creating a database cluster](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/getting_started/create_database.mdx) walks you through creating an HM-managed cluster.

## Prepare and import the source schema

Prepare the source schema and import it to the destination database. This step is not dependent on the previous steps, so it can be performed at any time before creating a migration. You must ensure the schema is converted and migrated to the destination database before you [create a data migration](oracle_to_pg.mdx#create-a-migration).

There are many tools EDB offers to prepare the schema, but for migrations from Oracle, the Hybrid Manager includes a Migration Portal integration. Refer to [Assessing schemas for HM projects](../migration_portal/hm_schema_migration.mdx) to use the integration to import the schema.

## Deploy the EDB DMS Reader

Deploying the EDB DMS Reader on an a machine that has access to your source database server allows the Reader to perform a connection between the Oracle database and the Hybrid Manager so it's recognized as a source for migration.

See [Installing the Data Migration Service Reader](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/getting_started/installing) for more information.

## Configure the EDB DMS Reader

To configure the EDB DMS Reader so the Hybrid Manager has access to source database data, you must configure the reader script to allow it to connect to both the source and destination databases for migration. 

Get credentials from the Hybrid Manager **Console** and configure the reader as explained in [Configuring and running Reader](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/getting_started/config_reader.mdx). 

## Run the EDB DMS Reader

[Run the EDB DMS Reader](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/getting_started/config_reader.mdx#running-the-edb-dms-reader) to start reading the source database. This doesn't perform a migration yet, only ensures the DMS has access and can read the source database.

## Create a migration

After you have configured the EDB DMS Reader to establish connections to the Hybrid Manager, create a new migration in the Console. A migration establishes a sync between the source database and a destination database with the help of EDB DMS.

See [Creating a migration](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/getting_started/create_migration.mdx) for instructions.

## Complete the migration

If you selected the **Snapshot** option, you can skip this step, as the DMS will automatically mark the migration as completed after it finishes copying the entire snapshot to the destination.

If you selected the **Snapshot + Streaming** option during Migration creation, the EDB DMS Reader will continue to stream any data updates performed on the source database to the destination database until you mark the migration as completed.

See [Stop the streaming process](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/getting_started/mark_completed.mdx) for instructions.

## Apply constraints

Before migrating data with the EDB Data Migration Service, you [prepared and imported the schema](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/getting_started/prepare_schema.mdx) of your source database while excluding constraints. 

Now, connect to the destination database and [re-apply the constraints](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/getting_started/apply_constraints.mdx) that were excluded from the schema and data migration.

## Verify migration

Compare the source and destination databases to verify that all data was migrated.
