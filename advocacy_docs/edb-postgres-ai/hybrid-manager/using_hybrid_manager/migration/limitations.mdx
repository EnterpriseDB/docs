These are the known issues, limitations, and notes for:

-   [General EDB Data Migration Service limitations](limitations.mdx#general-edb-data-migration-service-limitations)

-   [Oracle limitations](limitations.mdx#oracle-limitations)

-   [Postgres limitations](limitations.mdx#postgres-limitations)

## General EDB Data Migration Service limitations

-   **Case sensitivity in object names**: EDB DMS doesnâ€™t currently support migrating schemas, tables, and columns that have case-sensitive names.

-   **HM-managed destinations**: For migrations to HM-managed destinations, you must ensure `edb_admin` is the owner of the destination database, schema, and table in Hybrid Manager (HM) environments 1.1 and earlier. Otherwise, the migration will fail. This limitation will be fixed in HM versions 1.2 and later.

## Oracle limitations

### Unsupported Oracle data types

A limited number of Oracle data types and features aren't supported by EDB Data Migration Service (EDB DMS).

See the [Debezium documentation](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/3.2/connectors/oracle.html#oracle-data-type-mappings) for detailed comments on supported data types.

Unsupported Oracle data types include:

-   BFILE
-   LONG
-   LONG RAW
-   RAW
-   UROWID
-   User-defined types (REF, Varrays, Nested Tables)
-   ANYDATA
-   XMLTYPE
-   Spatial

EDB DMS supports replicating Oracle tables that contain BLOB, CLOB, or NCLOB columns only if these also have the primary key constraint. If the tables don't have the primary key constraint, the streaming replication will only support INSERT operations.

`BINARY_FLOAT` and `BINARY_DOUBLE` types in Oracle that might contain `Nan`, `+INF`, and `-INF` values are not supported by EDB DMS.

EDB DMS does not support values containing a null character (0x00) for text field types like `VARCHAR` and `CLOB` in Oracle.

### Oracle 21c databases

The Data Migration Service Reader and Writer support migrating Oracle 21c databases. However, Migration Portal doesn't. This means that to migrate 21c databases, you must manually perform the schema migration.

## Postgres limitations

### Unsupported domain type definitions in columns

The EDB DMS doesn't support migrating tables with columns that have user-defined domains as data types for the following data type domains:

-   DATE
-   TIME
-   TIMESTAMP
-   INTERVAL
-   UUID
-   ENUM
-   JSON
-   XML
-   POINT
-   LTREE
-   TSVECTOR

### TSVECTOR type migration workaround

Although we don't support the migration of `TSVECTOR` type columns, you can apply this workaround to enable their migration. For example, this `messages` table in source database contains a `TSVECTOR` column:

```sql
CREATE TABLE messages (
    title       text,
    body        text,
    tsv         tsvector
);
```

Before starting the migration, you need to create a table in the target database without the `TSVECTOR` column like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE messages (
    title       text,
    body        text,
);
```

When you perform the migration, you must exclude the `TSVECTOR` column in the UI when you review the tables on the `Review your Tables` page by unchecking the `tsv` column.

After the migration finishes, you will get the `title` and `body` columns migrated to the target database. Now you can add the `TSVECTOR` column to the target table like this:

```sql
ALTER TABLE messages ADD COLUMN tsv TSVECTOR DEFAULT NULL;
```

And then you need to run the following `UPDATE` statement to populate the column for all migrated data:

```sql
UPDATE messages SET tsv = to_tsvector('english', CONCAT(title, ' ', body)) WHERE tsv IS NULL;
```
