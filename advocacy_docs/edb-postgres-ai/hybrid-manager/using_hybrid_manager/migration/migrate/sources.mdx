title: Sources

---

Sources are databases you connected to HCP using the [Data Migration Service or DMS](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/) so you can use them as sources for migrations. For a database to appear in this view, you must install, configure, and run the [EDB DMS Reader](../../../../migration-etl/data-migration-service/getting_started/installing/).

This view displays all the configured sources in the project.

Each source's view shows the database name, database type (Postgres or Oracle), `cdcreader` ID, the current [status](sources.mdx#status), the source type, and more.

## Status

HCP can display the following statuses for a source.

| Status                         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Creating                       | The database source connection is being initialized. This is a transitional state.                                                                                                                     |
| Waiting for tables metadata    | The EDB DMS Reaader is retrieving information about the tables (for example, names, columns, data types). If the source is stuck in this state, there might be connectivity issues with the database.  |
| Ready to start a new migration | The EDB DMS Reader can successfully read the source database and you can use it for a migration.                                                                                                       |
| Running                        | A migration process using this source is currently active and data is being transferred.                                                                                                               |
| Paused                         | An ongoing migration process that's using this source was temporarily stopped.                                                                                                                         |
| Stopping                       | A currently running migration for this source is in the process of being terminated.                                                                                                                   |
| Connectivity error             | The EDB DMS Reader can't establish a connection to the externally managed database. This can be due to incorrect connection details (host, port, database name, username, password) or network issues. |
| Error                          | Unspecified problem. Investigate `cdcreader` logs to understand the specific cause.                                                                                                                    |

!!!note

    You can't use a source or destination that's part of an active migration (in any state, including running or paused) for another migration. The existing migration must be completed or deleted before you can reuse the source or destination.
