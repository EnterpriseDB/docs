description: Learn about creating migration credentials to prepare for database migrations to PG AI Hybrid Manager.

Credentials are required so you can perform migrations. Before you can add a source or destination for a migration to the Hybrid Manager (HM), you must create migration credentials. You can then use them to allow the EDB DMS Reader or Writer to connect to the HM. 

The **Credentials** view shows all the credentials in the project in a table format. The entry for each credential displays its name, status, when it was created, and expiry date.

### Creating migration credentials

See [Getting credentials](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migration_guides/self_managed_pg_to_self_managed_pg/creating_project_credentials/) for instructions on how to create and download migration credentials.

The decompressed credentials folder contains these files: 

-   `int.crt`
-   `int.truststore.p12`
-   `client.keystore.p12`
-   `client-key.pem`
-   `client-cert.pem`
