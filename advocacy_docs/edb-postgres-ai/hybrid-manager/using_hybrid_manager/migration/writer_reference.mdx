## DMS Writer general configuration

These parameters define the information the EDB DMS Writer requires to access the HM instance and project that you are using for the migration.

### DBCONFIG_ID

This is the name you assign to identify a destination. This name will later appear as a *destination* in the **Migrate** > **Destinations** section of the HM Console.

Consider the following ID guidelines:

-   The maximum character length for the ID is 255 characters.
-   You can use lowercase and uppercase characters, numbers, underscores(\_) and hyphens(-) for the ID. Other special characters are not supported.
-   The ID must be unique within a project. Do not use the same ID for two or more destinations in the same project.

### CLOUD_PROVIDER

Only required in HM versions 1.1 and earlier. Set to `appliance`.

### RW_SERVICE_HOST

Specifies the URL of the service that will host the migration. Set `RW_SERVICE_HOST` to the domain name or host associated with the HM ingress.

Derive `RW_SERVICE_HOST` from the `TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME` that was assigned by the administrators or installers of your HM instance via the `values.yaml` file. Alternatively, derive `RW_SERVICE_HOST` from the URL you use to access the HM Console. 

For example, if the URL for an HM Console is:

`https://portal.foo-bar.enterprise.network`

The `RW_SERVICE_HOST` will be: 

`https://transporter-rw-service.foo-bar.enterprise.network/transporter`

where you replace `portal` with `transporter-rw-service` and add `/transporter` at the end of the endpoint.

### TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH

Directory path to the `client-key.pem` private key you downloaded from the HM Console.

The HTTP client of the EDB DMS Writer uses it to perform mTLS authentication with the `transporter-rw-service`.

### TLS_CERTIFICATE_PATH

Directory path to the X509 `client-cert.pem` certificate you downloaded from the HM Console.

The HTTP client of the EDB DMS Writer uses it to perform mTLS authentication with the `transporter-rw-service`.

### TLS_CA_PATH

Directory path to the `int.cert` Certificate Authority you downloaded from the HM Console.

It signs the certificate configured in `TLS_CERTIFICATE_PATH`.

### APICURIOREQUEST_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_LOCATION

Directory path to the `client-keystore.p12` keystore location file you downloaded from the HM Console.
It is created from the private key and certificate configured in `TLS_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH` and `TLS_CERTIFICATE_PATH`.

The Apicurio client uses it to perform mTLS authentication with the `transporter-rw-service`.

### APICURIOREQUEST_TRUSTSTORE_LOCATION

Created from the Certificate Authority configured in `TLS_CA_PATH`.

The Apicurio client uses it to perform mTLS authentication with the `transporter-rw-service`.

### KAFKASECURITY_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_LOCATION

Directory path to the `client-keystore.p12` keystore location file you downloaded from the HM (same path as `APICURIOREQUEST_CLIENT_KEYSTORE_LOCATION`).

This will be required for Kafka client authentication later when the HM creates Kafka pods to perform the migration.

### KAFKASECURITY_TRUSTSTORE_LOCATION

Directory path to the `int.truststore.p12` location file you downloaded from the HM (same path as `APICURIOREQUEST_TRUSTSTORE_LOCATION`).

This will be required for Kafka client authentication later when the HM creates Kafka pods to perform the migration.

## DMS Writer destination database configuration

These parameters (`DBCONFIG_DATABASES` section) define a list of destination database information you require for the EDB DMS Writer to be able to write to the correct destination database for the migration.

You can configure the EDB DMS Writer to migrate multiple databases. The `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__TYPE` section delimits the information for the first database. You can use `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_1__TYPE` to provide data for a second database. Add more sections to the EDB DMS Writer (`DBCONFIG_DATABASES_2__TYPE`, `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_3__TYPE`) by increasing the index manually.

#### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__TYPE

This is the destination database type. EDB DMS Writer supports `POSTGRES`.

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__HOSTNAME

The hostname of the destination database.

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__PORT

The port of the destination database.

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__CATALOG

The database name in the destination database server.

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__USERNAME

The database username of the destination database.

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__PASSWORD

The password for the database username of the destination database.
