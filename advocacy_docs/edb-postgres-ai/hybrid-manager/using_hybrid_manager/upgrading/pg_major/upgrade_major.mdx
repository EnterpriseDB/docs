description: Learn how to do a major version upgrade on a single node or High Availability cluster on Hybrid Manager.

---

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites to get started are to have a cluster created with HM up and in a healthy state.

To ensure the cluster is in a healthy state, from the cluster's main page, select the **Monitoring** tab.
Now check the cluster and database metrics and make sure everything is operating and all metrics are within the defined acceptable parameters.

## Rollback considerations

!!! Note
There is no automatic rollback available on major upgrades on HM. 
To ensure that you can recover in the event of a failed upgrade, perform the following steps before attempting the major version upgrade on your cluster.
!!!

1. Take an on demand backup of the cluster targeted for the upgrade.
1. Restore a Postgres cluster from that backup.
  1. This restored cluster serves as the fallback if the upgrade fails.
  1. Confirm that the restore completes successfully and that the cluster is healthy.
1. Route application traffic to this restored fallback cluster.
1. Proceed with the major version upgrade on the original cluster by following the steps in the next section.

If the upgrade **fails**, your applications are already running against the healthy, restored cluster. 
If the upgrade **succeeds**, you can choose to:
  * Decomission the restored (non-upgraded) cluster, or
  * Route traffic back to the upgraded cluster after verifying its health status, and delete the restored cluster as appropriate.

## Upgrade the PG major version of an existing cluster created with HM

1.  First, from the cluster's main page, select **Quick Action>Upgrade Cluster** and then choose **Major Upgrade**.

1.  The **Upgrade Cluster &mdash; Major** dialogue window opens.

1.  Select your preferred new major version image.

1.  Review the upgrade path and confirm by selecting the **Continue** button.

1. The dialogue window now shows the specific package changes to be expected with the upgrade.
   Review these and select **Upgrade Cluster** if everything looks as correct.

1.  The upgrade is applied automatically. 
    You can then use the **Monitoring**, and **Logs** tabs to monitor the process and/or troubleshoot any unexpected behavior.

!!! Note

    On rare occasions, additional steps might be recommended after the major upgrade is completed for certain product release. 
    Consult the Release notes for the product in question to see if this is necessary in your case.
