---

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites to get started are to have a cluster created with HM up and in a healthy state.

To ensure the cluster is in a healthy state, from the cluster's main page, select the **Monitoring** tab.
Now check the cluster and database metrics and make sure everything is operating and all metrics are within the defined acceptable parameters.

## Upgrade the PG major version of an existing cluster created with HM

1.  First, from the cluster's main page, select **Quick Action>Upgrade Cluster** and then choose **Major Upgrade**.

1.  The **Upgrade Cluster &mdash; Major** dialogue window opens.

1.  Select your preferred new major version image.

1.  Review the upgrade path and confirm by selecting the **Continue** button.

1. The dialogue window now shows the specific package changes to be expected with the upgrade.
   Review these and select **Upgrade Cluster** if everything looks as correct.

1.  The upgrade is applied automatically. 
    You can then use the **Monitoring**, and **Logs** tabs to monitor the process and/or troubleshoot any unexpected behavior.

!!! Note

    On rare occasions, additional steps might be recommended after the major upgrade is completed for certain product release. 
    Consult the Release notes for the product in question to see if this is necessary in your case.

## Rollback considerations

Rollback after a major version upgrade is not possible with these types of clusters.  To undo the major upgrade, 
create a logical dump of your databases using the `pg_dump` or `pg_dumpall` tools, create a new cluster using 
the desired Postgres version, use `pg_restore` to load the logical dump into it, and switch application workloads 
over to the new cluster.

You can then delete the upgraded cluster or troubleshoot it further.
