---

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites to get started are to have a cluster created with HM up and in a healthy state.

To ensure the cluster is in a healthy state, from the cluster's main page, select the **Monitoring** tab.
Now check the cluster and database metrics and make sure everything is operating and all metrics are within the defined acceptable parameters.

## Upgrade the PG major version of an existing cluster created with HM

For major upgrades of Advanced High Availability or Distributed High Availability clusters (those with multiple data groups), you must upgrade all data and witness groups sequentially. While the order of groups isn't critical, ensure each groups' upgrade completes entirely before starting the next.

1.  From the cluster's main page, next to the first data group you want to upgrade, select the three-dot menu, **Upgrade Data Group** and then choose **Major Upgrade**.

    The **Upgrade Cluster &mdash; Major** dialogue window opens.

1.  Select your preferred new major version image.

1.  Review the upgrade path and confirm by selecting the **Continue** button.

1. The dialogue window now shows the specific package changes to be expected with the upgrade.
   Review these and select **Upgrade Cluster** if everything looks as correct.

1.  The upgrade is applied automatically. 
    You can then use the **Monitoring**, and **Logs** tabs to monitor the process and/or troubleshoot any unexpected behavior.

1.  After the first data group is successfully upgraded and healthy, proceed to upgrade the remaining data and witness groups one by one until the entire cluster is on the new version.

!!! Note
    On rare occasions, additional steps might be recommended after the major upgrade is completed for certain product release. 
    Consult the Release notes for the product in question to see if this is necessary in your case.

## Rollback considerations

There is no automatic rollback available with this approach and performing a downgrade is not recommended. 
To undo the minor upgrade, restore from the latest backup in a new cluster running the preferred minor version and switching application workloads over to the new cluster.
You can then delete the PG minor upgraded cluster or troubleshoot it further.
