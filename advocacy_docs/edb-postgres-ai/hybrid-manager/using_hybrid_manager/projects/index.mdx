In Hybrid Manager, you use projects to associate organizationally related resources together. Projects simplify adminstering and accessing these resources.

To view a list of projects, select the **Projects** tab. Each project card shows:

- The project name
- The number of clusters in the project
- The number of users with access to the project
- A control for adding tags to the project, key-value pairs that help you to organize your resources
- Logs of active cloud service providers (CSPs) configured in the project.

An ellipses menu in each card gives you quick access to the functions you can perform when viewing the [project details](#project-details).

If you have owner privileges, from this view you also can create projects. 

## Creating projects

1. Select the **Projects** tab.
1. Select **Create New Project**.
1. Enter a name for the project. 
1. Optionally, add tags to the project.
1. Select **Create New Project**.

After you create the project, you see the project details. You're the owner of the new project, and you can start to add resources.

## Project details

The detailed view of the project is where you perform your project management tasks. To open the detailed view, either create a project or select a project from the list of projects on the **Projects** page. This view includes a description of each cluster in the project and metrics including, memory usage, CPU usage, storage usage, disk IOPS and transaction rate, and the database size.

![Project Overview](../../images/project-overview.png)

In a project, you can:

- [Create, view, and manage clusters](../cluster_management/).
- [Manage storage locations](storage-locations.mdx).
- Add catalogs.
- [View and manage the users in the project](../monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/create_machine_user.mdx).
- View and download the activity log. The activity log is a record of all the actions that were performed in the current project, such as cluster creation and deletion and software installation.
- [Manage project settings](settings/index.mdx), including notifications, security, and alerts.
- [View a usage report](usage-report.mdx).
- [View and manage database migrations](migrate/index.mdx).


For each cluster, using the ellipsis menu in the upper-right corner of the card, you can also:

- Select **Edit Cluster** to [edit the cluster](../cluster_management/manage-clusters/edit-clusters.mdx).
- Select **Credential Information to see the connection details for the cluster, including the connection URL, username, and the database name. You can use these details to connect to the cluster from a Postgres client. Passwords aren't shown, but you can reset the password if you need to. For more information, see [Credentials](migrate/credentials.mdx).

## Managing projects

You can rename and delete projects. See [Managing projects](managing.mdx).
