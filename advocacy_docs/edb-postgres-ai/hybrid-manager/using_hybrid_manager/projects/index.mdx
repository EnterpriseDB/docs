In the overview view of projects, you can see the name of each project, an option to add tags, the number of clusters in the project, and the number of users who have access to that project.

Select **View Projects** to open the **Projects** tab for a full view.

If you have owner privileges, you can create projects. Select **Create New Project**, enter a name and, optionally, select tags for the new project. Then select **Create New Project** to create the project. 

After you create the project, the Project view opens. You're the owner of the new project, and you can start to add resources.

## Overview

The overview page is the default view when selecting a project. It shows your name, the project name, the number of resources in the project, and the status of the top three resources in the project.

For each project, in the default view, you are able to see a description of the cluster. Below that's a selection of metrics for the cluster including, memory usage, CPU usage, storage usage, disk IOPS and transaction rate and the database size.

To the right of the cluster's information is an ellipsis menu button, which when selected offers the following options:

| Option                 | Description                                              |
| :--------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------- |
| Credential Information | Show the credentials and URLs for accessing this cluster |
| Edit Cluster           | Edit the cluster details and configuration               |

**Edit Cluster** takes you to the appropriate page to edit the cluster details, depending on the type of cluster, database or Lakehouse. The page you go to is similar to the Create page used to create that type of cluster.

The **Credential Information** option shows you the connection details for the cluster, including the connection URL, username, and the database name. You can use these details to connect to the cluster from a Postgres client. Passwords aren't shown in the UI, but you can reset the password if you need to.
