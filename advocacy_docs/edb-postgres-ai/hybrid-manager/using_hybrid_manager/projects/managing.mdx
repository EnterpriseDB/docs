You can view and manage projects in EDB Postgres AI using several methods.

### Creating a project

All accounts have a default project.

You can create projects in the single-pane-of-glass view of projects and in the **Projects** tab. Both views have a **Create New Project** button.

Select the button to open a page where you can enter a project name and, optionally, add tags to the project. Enter a name and select **Create New Project** to create an empty project that your user owns.

### Renaming a project

You can rename a project in the single-pane-of-glass view of projects and in the **Projects** tab. To rename a project:

1.  Locate the project you want to rename.
2.  From the ellipses menu to the right of the project name, select **Edit**. 
3.  Enter the new project name and select **Update Project**.

### Deleting a project

You can delete a project in the single-pane-of-glass view of projects and in the **Projects** tab. 

To delete a project:

1.  Locate the project you want to delete.

2.  From the ellipsis menu to the right of the project name, select **Delete**.

    A dialog box prompts you to confirm the deletion.

3.  If there are any clusters in the project, you must delete them before you can delete the project. The display shows any remaining clusters with a check box next to each one. Select the check box for each cluster you want to delete, or select **Select All**. 

4.  After you select the clusters to delete, you must enter `delete clusters` in the text box to confirm the deletion. Entering this text enables the **Delete All Clusters** button.

5.  Select **Delete All Clusters** to permanently delete the selected clusters.

6.  When there are no clusters in the project, a dialog box appears listing the project name with a check box. Select the check box and enter `delete project` in the text field that appears. Entering this text enables the **Delete Project** button. 

7.  Select **Delete Project** to completely delete the project.
