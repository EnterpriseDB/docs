You can configure project-specific settings like notifications, security, and alerts. Use the **Settings** menu to access these settings.

-   Profile — Select **Profile** to change your project's name at any time. Project names must be unique in a Hybrid Manager instance.

-   [Notifications](notifications.mdx) — Select **Notifications** to configure how the project’s notifications are send.

-   Security — Select **Security** to add externally-managed keys for transparent data encryption (TDE) to this project. You can use these keys later during cluster creation to add data encryption. Refer to [Enabling Key Management Systems for TDE](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/kms_for_tde/) for KMS-specific instructions.

-   [Alerts](alerts.mdx) — Select **Alerts** to see the alert settings of the project and control how and when they're sent.
