navTitle: HM-managed database

---

You can use existing databases as destinations for migrations. To use an existing instance as a destination for the migration, ensure the tables you migrate and the load generated on the destination don't interfere with existing workloads.

If you don't have a destination database cluster on the HM yet, create one that the HM can use as destination for migrations:

1.  In the HM Console, select the project where you want to create the database cluster.

    See [Creating a project](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/projects/#creating-projects) if you want to create one.

1.  Within your project, select **Create New** and **Database Cluster** to create an instance that will serve as destination for the EDB Data Migration Service (EDB DMS).

    See [Creating a cluster](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/creating_cluster/creating_a_cluster/) for detailed instructions on how to create a single-node or a primary/standby high availability cluster.

    See [Creating a distributed high-availability cluster](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/creating_cluster/creating_a_dha_cluster/) for detailed instructions on how to create a distributed high availibility cluster.

1.  In the **Clusters** page, select your cluster, and use the **Quick Connect** option to access your instance from your terminal.

1.  Create a new empty database that you will use as a destination for the migration. Alternatively, you can use the default database `edb_admin`.
