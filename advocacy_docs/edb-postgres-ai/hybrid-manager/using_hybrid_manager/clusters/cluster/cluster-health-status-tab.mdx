You can see the **Health Status** tab only where a cluster with replication is operating. This includes primary/standby clusters and distributed high-availability clusters. The tab provides a summary of the health status of the cluster in terms of replication between the nodes in the cluster.

## Health status for a primary/standby cluster

The health status for a primary/standby cluster shows the replication status of the cluster. For example:

### Health summary

The health summary includes the following information:

-   **Replication slot status** — Replication slots tracks the status of streaming replication, ensuring continuous data availability and minimizing replication lag.

-   **Clock skew** — Clock skew status monitors and reports any discrepancies in time synchronization among distributed instances to ensure data consistency and reliability.

-   **Node status** — Node status indicates the availability of the individual nodes in a cluster for ensuring high availability. You can also see the number of nodes versus the number of nodes expected in the cluster.

-   **Transaction rate** — Shows the number of transactions per second for each Postgres node.

### Node health

Under **Node Health**, you can see the status of each node in the cluster, including the cluster status, cluster name, and the number of available and expected nodes in the cluster. The list of the nodes in the cluster includes the following information for each node:

-   **Node status and name** — The status of the node shown in a colored circle. The color indicates the status of the node: green for up and running and red for down.
    Labels that appear below the node status denote any role the node is playing. For primary/standby clusters, the **Primary** label shows on the current primary node.

-   **Connections** — The number of connections between client applications and the node. You can see this number versus the maximum connections setting of the node.

-   **WAL size** — The current write-ahead log (WAL) size for the node.

-   **Memory** — The current memory usage for the node, displayed as a percentage of the total memory available to the node.

-   **Storage** - The current storage usage for the node, displayed as a percentage of the total storage available to the node.

### Replication status

The replication status between the nodes in the cluster appears as a matrix of source and target nodes. A primary/standby cluster has one source and multiple standby replicas. For each target and source, the matrix shows the status of the replication between the two nodes.

You can display replication lag in terms of time or size of lag. Use the controls under **Replication Status** to select how you want to display lag. The default is time.

Use the radio button to view these other metrics related to the replication status:

-   **Write** — (Default) The difference in bytes from the last WAL location written to disk by this standby server or the time elapsed between flushing recent WAL locally and receiving notification that this standby server wrote to it.
-   **Replay** — The difference in bytes from the last WAL location replayed into the database on this standby server or the time elapsed between flushing recent WAL locally and receiving notification that this standby server flushed and applied it.
-   **Flush** — The difference in bytes from the last WAL location flushed to disk by this standby server or the time elapsed between flushing recent WAL locally and receiving notification that this standby server wrote and flushed it.
-   **Sent** — The difference in bytes from the last WAL location sent on this connection. There's no time equivalent for this metric.

## Health status for a distributed high-availability cluster

The health status for a distributed high-availability cluster shows the replication status of the cluster. For example:

### Health summary

The health summary displays the following information:

-   **Raft status** — Raft status provides a real-time overview of the consensus algorithm health and synchronization state for high availability and fault tolerance. Raft is key to ensuring that all nodes in the cluster agree on the current state of the system, which is crucial for maintaining data integrity and availability.

-   **Replication slot status** — Replication slots track the status of streaming replication, ensuring continuous data availability and minimizing replication lag.

-   **Clock skew** — Clock skew status monitors and reports any discrepancies in time synchronization among distributed instances to ensure data consistency and reliability.

-   **Proxy status** — Connections to the cluster are made through a proxy. The proxy status shows the status and availability of the proxies. Each data group has one or two proxies. You can also see the number of proxies versus the number of proxies expected in the cluster.

-   **Node status** — Node status indicates the availability of all the individual nodes in a cluster for ensuring high availability. You can also see the number of nodes versus the number of nodes expected in the cluster.

-   **Transaction rate** — Shows the number of transactions per second for each Postgres node.

### Group health

View the **Group Health** information to see the status of each group in the cluster. Each group, data group, or witness group is listed. Each group section shows the group status, name, and the number of available and expected nodes in the cluster. 

The list of the nodes in the group shows the following information for each node:

-   **Node status and name** — The status of the node is shown in a colored circle. The color indicates the status of the node: green for up and running and red for down.
    Labels might also appear that denote any role the node is playing. For distributed high-availability clusters, the labels are:

    ```
    * **Global Raft Leader**: The node is the leader of the cluster for Raft consensus.
    * **Global Write Leader**: The node is the leader of the cluster for write operations.
    * **Raft Leader**: The node is the leader of the group for Raft consensus.
    * **Write Leader**: The node is the leader of the group for write operations.
    * **Witness**: The node is a witness node in the group.
    ```

-   **Connections** — The number of connections between client applications and the nodes displayed versus the maximum connections setting of the node.

-   **WAL size** — The current write-ahead log (WAL) size for the node.

-   **Memory** — The current memory usage for the node, displayed as a percentage of the total memory available to the node.

-   **Storage** — The current storage usage for the node, displayed as a percentage of the total storage available to the node.

-   **Replication status** — The replication status between the nodes in the cluster appears as a matrix of source and target nodes. In a distributed high-availability cluster, every node replicates to every other node. For each target and source, the matrix shows the status of the replication between the two nodes.

      You can display replication lag in terms of time or size of lag. Use the controls under **Replication Status** to select how you want to display lag. The default is time.

      Use the radio buttons to view these other metrics related to the replication status:

    -   **Write**: (Default) The difference in bytes from the last WAL location written to disk by this standby server or the time elapsed between flushing recent WAL locally and receiving notification that this standby server wrote to it.
    -   **Replay**: The difference in bytes from the last WAL location replayed into the database on this standby server or the time elapsed between flushing recent WAL locally and receiving notification that this standby server flushed and applied it.
    -   **Flush**: The difference in bytes from the last WAL location flushed to disk by this standby server or the time elapsed between flushing recent WAL locally and receiving notification that this standby server wrote and flushed it.
    -   **Sent**: The difference in bytes from the last WAL location sent on this connection. There's no time equivalent for this metric.
