title: Configuring SAML
navTitle: SAML
description: Set up SAML with Okta to manage your organization's users.
---

Configure SAML to work with Dex authentication to enable end users to log in to the Console using SAML server credentials. This example uses Okta for SAML configuration. 

## Creating a SAML application

1.  Log in to Okta, and create a new app integration.   

1.  Select **SAML 2.0**.   

1.  Assign an app name and other **General Settings** and select **Next**.    

1.  Enter the Dex callback URL in both the **Single sign-on URL** (ACS URL) and **Audience URI** fields. The format is `https://<hybrid_manager_URL>/auth/callback`.  

1.  Map the **Attribute Statements** for username and email, for example: 

    | Name  | Name format | Value                              |
    |:------|:------------|:-----------------------------------|
    | name  | Unspecified | “user.firstName+” “+user.lastName” |
    | email | Unspecified | user. email                           |

1.  After the application is created, assign the users or groups you want to have access to the Hybrid Manager to the created app integration. You can do this on the **Assignments** tab. 

## Configuring Dex to connect to Okta via SAML connector

Add an entry for the Okta SAML configuration where you specify the Okta and Dex endpoints for communication. Add the entry either in your `values.yaml` file or `HybridControlPlane` custom resource, depending on the installation method you use.

```shell
  portal:
    authentication:
      clientSecret: "edb-postgres-ai-secret"
      idpConnectors:
        - type: saml
          name: Okta
          id: okta
          config:
            ssoURL: <https://saml.example.com/sso>
            redirectURI: <https://<hybrid_manager_URL>/auth/callback>
            usernameAttr: name
            emailAttr: email
            groupsAttr: groups
            caData: <dNekV4TURSYUZ3MHpOREV3T01Rc3dDUVlEVlFRR1CRU=>
      staticPasswords:
        - [...]
```

## Parameters 

This section covers the essential identity provider settings within the `portal.authentication` configuration. It focuses only on the parameters you must customize for your environment. Any other parameters not detailed here can be configured as shown in the provided example.

| Parameter                           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
|:------------------------------------|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `clientSecret`                      | Client secret for the Hybrid Manager authentication, use the default `edb-postgres-ai-secret`.                                                                                                                        |
| `idpConnectors`                     | Enter an array of data per IdP connector you want to use for authentication. Refer to the official [Dex SAML documentation](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/saml/#configuration) for more guidance.               |
| `idpConnectors.config.ssoURL`       | The Single Sign-On URL is the endpoint where Dex will send authentication requests. You can obtain it from your Okta Sign On configuration.                                                                         |
| `idpConnectors.config.redirectURI`  | ACS URL of Hybrid Manager, which is the endpoint where the Okta SAML instance will send replies to. Same as the Dex callback URL you provided when creating the SAML application.                                   |
| `idpConnectors.config.usernameAttr` | Tells Dex which attribute of the reply contains the user’s username. Value must match the attribute names you specified when creating the SAML application.                                                         |
| `idpConnectors.config.email`        | Tells Dex which attribute of the reply contains the user’s email. Value must match the attribute names you specified when creating the SAML application.                                                            |
| `idpConnectors.config.groupsAttr`   | Tells Dex which attribute of the reply contains information about to which groups a user’s belongs.                                                                                                                 |
| `idpConnectors.config.caData`       | Certificate from your Okta application’s SAML configuration. It allows the Hybrid Manager to authenticate replies from the SAML server. You can obtain it from your Okta Sign On configuration, SAML setup options. |

## Applying Dex configuration

After changing the authentication settings, you'll need to reconcile the Dex configuration and restart the Dex services for your changes to take effect. See [Applying Dex](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/managing_users/apply_dex_config/) for instructions. 

## Assigning new owner and disable native user 

After assigning a new organization owner in the Hybrid Manager Console, disable the native user. For this, refer to [Disabling a native user](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/managing_users/native_users/disable_native_user/).
