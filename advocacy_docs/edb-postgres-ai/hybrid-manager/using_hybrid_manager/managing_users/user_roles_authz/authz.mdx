description: See what the predefined Hybrid Manager user roles are authorized to access.

Authorization of these user roles follows a Role-based Access Control (RBAC) model with the restrictions applying to a specific scope&mdash;either within one project or within one account.

The following list does not cover Postgres cluster database authorization. 

As of now, you cannot create custom roles. There are only these 11 predefined roles available:
