description: See what the predefined Hybrid Manager user roles are authorized to access.

Authorization of these user roles follows a role-based access control (RBAC) model with the restrictions applying to a specific scope&mdash;either within one project or within one account.

The following list doesn't cover Postgres cluster database authorization. 

Currently, you can't create custom roles. Only these 11 predefined roles are available.
