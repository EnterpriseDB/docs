To avoid unauthorized access to your environment, change the password of the default native user during deployment or immediately after deployment. You can change the password for native users you manually added in the same way.

1.  Create a new bcrypt-hashed password. To generate this value, use:

    ```shell
    echo ${password} | htpasswd -BinC 10 admin | cut -d: -f2
    ```

    Where the new password is stored behind the `${password}` variable.

    The output prints the new hashed password, for example, `$2y$10$YDHMEnc8VZKnhvze538ePOLKol7dFH.S7IgpqC3.X3R/3P2Q9zRcG`.

1.  Replace the hash for the existing user: `owner@mycompany.com` in this example. Replace this value either in your `values.yaml` file or `HybridControlPlane` custom resource, depending on the installation method you use.

    ```yaml
    portal:
      authentication:
        staticPasswords:
          - email: "owner@mycompany.com"
            hash: "$2y$10$YDHMEnc8VZKnhvze538ePOLKol7dFH.S7IgpqC3.X3R/    3P2Q9zRcG"
            username: "owner@mycompany.com"
            userID: "c5998173-a605-449a-a9a5-4a9c33e26df7"
    ```

1.  If you're installing Hybrid Manager (HM), continue performing the installation. If you're modifying the parameter in an already deployed installation, [apply the DEX configuration](../apply_dex_config/) to populate the changes.
