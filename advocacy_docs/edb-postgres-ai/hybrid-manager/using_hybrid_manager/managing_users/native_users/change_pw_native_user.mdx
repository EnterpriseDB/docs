description: Change the password of native users.

Change the password of the default native user during deployment or immediately after deployment to avoid unauthorized access to your environment. You can change the password for native users you have manually added in the same way.

1.  Create a new bcrypt-hashed password. To generate this value, use:

    ```shell
    echo ${password} | htpasswd -BinC 10 admin | cut -d: -f2
    ```

    Where the new password is stored behind the `${password}` variable.

    The output prints the new hashed password, e.g. `$2y$10$YDHMEnc8VZKnhvze538ePOLKol7dFH.S7IgpqC3.X3R/3P2Q9zRcG` 

1.  Replace the hash for the existing user, in this example, `owner@mycompany.com`. You will have to replace this value either in your `values.yaml` file or `HybridControlPlane` custom resource, depending on the installation method you use.

    ```yaml
    portal:
      authentication:
        staticPasswords:
          - email: "owner@mycompany.com"
            hash: "$2y$10$YDHMEnc8VZKnhvze538ePOLKol7dFH.S7IgpqC3.X3R/    3P2Q9zRcG"
            username: "owner@mycompany.com"
            userID: "c5998173-a605-449a-a9a5-4a9c33e26df7"
    ```

1.  If you are installing the Hybrid Manager, continue performing the installation. If you are modifying the parameter in an already deployed installation, [apply the DEX configuration](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/managing_users/apply_dex_config/) to populate the changes.
