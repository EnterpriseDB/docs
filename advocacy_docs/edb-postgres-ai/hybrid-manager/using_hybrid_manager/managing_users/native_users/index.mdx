description: Create and manage additional native users for testing purposes or remove native users after configuring an IdP.
---

For testing or demo environments, you can use native users to simplify operations. To manage the lifecycle of native users you can:

- [Change the password of a native user](change_pw_native_user).
- [Create additional native users](create_native_user).

For production deployments, we strongly recommend [configuring an external IdP](../byo_idp/). After configuring an IdP, you can: 

- [Disable native user login](disable_native_user)
