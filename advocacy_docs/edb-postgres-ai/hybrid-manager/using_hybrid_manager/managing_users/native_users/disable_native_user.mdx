Before disabling the native user, confirm that at least one other user has the **organization owner** role. If you haven't assigned a new organization owner yet:

## Assign a new organization owner 

1.  Log in as the new administrator user to the Hybrid Manager Console at least once. This ensures the Console indexes the new user. Afterward, log out.

1.  Log in as the current owner of the Hybrid Manager (for example, the native owner@mycompany.com user).

1.  From the top-right profile menu, select **User management**. Verify the new administrator user is in the list.   

1.  Edit the new administrator user and assign them the “owner” role.

## Disable native users

1.  To disable the native user login, unset the `staticPasswords` configuration by setting `portal.authentication.staticPasswords` to `[]`:

    ```
    portal:
      authentication:
        staticPasswords: []
    ```
1.  [Apply the DEX configuration](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/managing_users/apply_dex_config/) again to populate the changes.
