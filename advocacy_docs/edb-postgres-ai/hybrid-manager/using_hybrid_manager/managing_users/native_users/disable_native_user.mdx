description: After configuring an external IdP, disable native user login.
---

Before disabling native user login, confirm that at least one other IdP user has the **organization owner** role. Assign a new organization owner if you haven't done that yet.

## Assign a new organization owner 

1.  Log in to the Hybrid Manager Console as the IdP user that will become the organization owner at least once. This ensures the Console indexes the new user. Afterward, log out.

1.  Log in as the current native owner of the Hybrid Manager (for example, `owner@mycompany.com`).

1.  From the top-right profile menu, select **User management**. Verify the user that will become the new owner is in the list.   

1.  Edit the user and assign them the “owner” role.

## Disable native users

1.  To disable native user login, unset the `staticPasswords` configuration by setting `portal.authentication.staticPasswords` to `[]`:

    ```
    portal:
      authentication:
        staticPasswords: []
    ```
1.  [Apply the DEX configuration](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/managing_users/apply_dex_config/) again to populate the changes.
