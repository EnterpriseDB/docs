The Hybrid Manager uses [Dex](https://dexidp.io/docs/) for user authentication in the Console, acting as a proxy between the Hybrid Manager and any native users or external user management systems (Identity Providers or IdPs) like LDAP and SAML. 

During the initial bootstraping of the Hybrid Manager, an administrator sets up a native super-user for Console access. Use this native super-user to sign in to the Console for the first time.

For testing or demo environments, you can simplify operations by adding more native users as needed. 

- See [Creating native users](native_users/create_native_user) for more information.

For production deployments, we strongly recommend configuring an external IdP like LDAP, SAML, or another [supported connector](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/). This ensures robust and secure user management. After configuring your chosen IdP and adding new administrators for the organization, you should disable the native user login.
