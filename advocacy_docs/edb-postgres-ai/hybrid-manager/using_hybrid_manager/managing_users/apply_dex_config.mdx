After modifying the user authentication settings, you'll need to reconcile the Dex configuration and restart its services for your changes to take effect. The method for reconciling these updates depends on how you installed the Hybrid Manager: either via a Helm chart or using the EDB Operator.

## Helm chart installations 

On Hybrid Manager instances that were installed using the Helm chart method, apply the Dex modifications as follows:

1.  Reapply the helm chart with the updated `values.yaml`. See [Install Hybrid Manager using the Helm chart](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/install/rhos/installing/installhelm/#install-hybrid-manager-using-the-helm-chart) for an example on how to do this on a RHOS installation.

1.  Restart Dex to reload and add the new users:

    ```
    kubectl rollout restart deploy upm-dex -n upm-dex
    ```

## Operator installations

On Hybrid Manager instances that were installed using the operator method, apply the DEX modifications as follows: 

1.  Reapply the `HybridControlPlane` Custom Resource (CR). See [Install Hybrid Manager using Operator](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/install/rhos/installing/installop/#install-hybrid-manager-on-rhos) for an example on how to do this on a RHOS installation.

1.  Restart Dex to reload and add the new users:

    ```
    kubectl rollout restart deploy upm-dex -n upm-dex
    ```
