While the connection to the underlying repositories is configured by the system administrator, you can manage the repositories that are available in the Asset Library.

This is achieved by allowing the system to include repositories and tagged images that match a specific pattern or patterns, with each pattern defined as a rule. This then allows you to control which repositories are included in the Asset Library and which images are available for use in your Hybrid Manager clusters.

By default, the asset library includes all the official Hybrid Manager repositories and all the tagged images within those repositories.

For more control over the repositories and images available in the Asset Library, you can manage your own private repository, which can be hosted on a private registry. This gives you complete control over what the registry contains and allows you to add your own images and manage them as needed. Whichever route you choose, the Asset Library's repository inclusion rules still operate to control what is available in the Asset Library.

## Manage Repositories

The **Manage Repositories** page allows you to add, edit or delete repositories registrations that are available in the Asset Library. This page is accessed by clicking the **Manage Repositories** button in the **Container Images** tab of the Asset Library.

The screen displays a table of the repositories that are currently registered in the Asset Library, with the following columns:

-   **Repository Name Regex**: The regular expression that the name of the repository must match.
-   **Number of Rules**: The number of rules that are associated with this repository registration.
-   **Created**: The date and time when the repository registration was created.

On each row, when populated, there is also an **Edit** button that allows you to edit the repository registration and a **Delete** button that allows you to delete the repository registration.

There is also a search field that allows you to search for a specific repository registration by name and a sort control that allows you to sort the table by the repository name or created date.

In the top right corner of the screen, there is a button to **Register New Repository**. Clicking this button opens a dialog that allows you to add a new repository registration.

## Register New Repository

When you click the **Register New Repository** button, a dialog opens that allows you to enter the details of the new repository registration.

The dialog contains the following fields:

-   **Repository Name Regex**: A regular expression that matches the name of the repository. This is used to filter which repositories are included in the Asset Library.

This field needs to match the name of the repository (or repositories) that you want to include in the Asset Library. For example, if you want to include all repositories that start with `pgaihm-`, you would enter `^pgaihm-.*$` as the regular expression. You can enter plain text but it will be treated as a regular expression, but it is recommended to use a regular expression to ensure that the repository name matches the pattern you want.

-   **Rules**: A list of rules that are associated with this repository registration. Each rule consists of a regular expression that matches a tag that is associated with the image. The rules are used to filter which images are included in the Asset Library. For example if you want to include all images with the tag `latest`, you would enter `^latest$` as the regular expression. You can enter plain text but it will be treated as a regular expression, but it is recommended to use a regular expression to ensure that the tag eactly matches the pattern you want.

You can add multiple rules by clicking the **Add Rule** button, which will add a new row to the list of rules. You can also delete a rule by clicking the **Delete** button next to the rule.

Once you have entered the details of the new repository registration, click the **Register Repository** button to save the registration. The new repository registration will then be added to the list of registered repositories and will be available in the Asset Library. This may take a few minutes to complete as the system will need to scan the repository for images that match the rules you have defined.

You can also cancel the registration by clicking the **Cancel** button, which will close the dialog without saving any changes.

You will be returned to the **Manage Repositories** page, where you can see the new repository registration in the list of registered repositories.

Return to the [Asset Library](asset-library.mdx) to see the effect of new repository rules and the images that are now available in the Asset Library.
