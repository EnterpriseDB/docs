The Asset Library is divided into two main sections: **Container Images** and **Knowledge Base**. Each section allows you to view and manage the assets available for use in your Hybrid Manager clusters.

## Container Images

The **Container Images** section of the Asset Library is where you can view and manage the container images available for use in your Hybrid Manager clusters. This includes the ability to search for specific images, filter the list of images by various criteria, and view detailed information about each image. Read the [Container Images](container-images.mdx) guide for more information on how to use this tab.

## Knowledge Bases

A model in the Knowledge Bases is an AI model that can be used in Hybrid Manager. These models can be trained on specific datasets and can be used to perform various tasks, such as natural language processing, image recognition, and more. Read the [Knowledge Bases](knowledge-bases.mdx) guide for more information on how to use this tab.
