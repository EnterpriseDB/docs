The **Container Images** section of the asset library is where you can view and manage the container images available for use in your Hybrid Manager clusters.

## Container images

A container image is a configuration of the database that includes various extensions. Each image is identified by its name and an image tag.

For each name, there can be multiple image tags representing different versions and different combinations of extensions loaded in the image.

For example, official HM images have an image name `postgresql` and image tag `17.4-2503191025` that represents a community PostgreSQL image for version 17.4. The `2503191025` is the build date and time of the image (2025/03/19 10:25). The postfix `-full` indicates that this image includes all the extensions available in the HM Postgres distribution.

This tag format is specific to the official HM images and may differ for other images. The image name is used to identify the type of image, such as a particular flavor of Postgres, and the image tag is used to identify the specific version of the image.

## Image statistics

A summary of the number of images available in the library is listed by type. The types of images are:

-   **Total Image Tags**: The total number of image tags available in the library, where a tag represents a specific version of an image.
-   **PostgreSQL Images**: The number of Postgres images available in the library.
-   **AI Model Images**: The number of AI model images available in the library.

## Container images search and filter bar

In this view, use the **Search** field to enter a search term that's part of the name or description of the image repository. Use the **Filter** field to filter the repositories by the type (Postgres or AI Model).

Use the **Sort** field to sort the repositories by name, by description, by type, or by the date the repository was updated.

On the search and filter bar, select **Manage Repositories** to manage the repositories that are available in the library. The the dialog box to add, edit, or delete repositories. In the **Manage Repositories** page, you can manage the repositories and images that are available in the asset library. For more information on how to manage repositories, see [Manage repositories](manage-repositories.mdx).

## Container images cards

Each image repository is displayed in a card format with the following information:

-   **Name**: The name of the image repository.
-   **Description**: A short description of the image repository.
-   **Tags**: Hybrid Manager tags associated with this image repository. If no tags are associated with the image repository, **Add Tag** appears.
-   **Updated**: The number of days since the image repository was last updated.

!!! Warning "Hybrid Manager tags"
    HM tags aren't asset/image tags. HM tags are created in HM to identify and organize HM resources. You create and manage them using the **Tags** menu item in your user menu in the top-right corner of the console. HM tags aren't related to the image tags used to identify the version of an image.

Select the name of an image repository to go to the page with the details of that image.

## Image details

The **Image Details** page for an image has two tabs: **Overview** and **Image Tags**. An **Add Tag** button lets you add an HM tag to the image repository. Any existing tags are displayed before the button, and you can select a tag to view its details.

### Overview tab

The **Overview** tab provides a summary of the image repository, including:

-   **README**: A textual description of the image repository, which can include any relevant information about the image, such as how to use it, what it contains, and other useful details.
-   **Recent Image Tags**: The 10 most recently created image tags for this image repository. You can select each tag to go to the **Image Tag Details** page for that tag.

The **Clusters Using This Image** section lists any clusters in the estate that are using an image from this repository. If no clusters are using this image, the message "No Data" appears.

Use the search and filter bar to search for clusters. Use the **Search** field allows to enter a search term that's part of the name or description of the cluster. Use the **Filter** field to filter the clusters by their attributes (cluster type, cluster architecture, Postgres flavor, and Postgres version). Use the **Sort** field to display clusters to sort by name, description, or the date the cluster was created.

Select a cluster name to go to the **Cluster Details Overview** page for that cluster.

### Image tags

Select the **Image Tags** tab to see a list of all the image tags associated with this image repository.

Each tag is displayed in a table format with the following information:

-   **Name**: The name of the image tag.
-   **Created**: The date and time when the image tag was created.
-   **Last Pushed**: The date and time when the image tag was pushed to the repository.
-   **Platform Architecture**: The platform architectures for which the image tag is available, such as X86, AMD64, ARM64, PPC64LE, or S390X.
-   **SHA**: The SHA256 hash of the image, which is a unique identifier for the image. You can use it to verify the image against other repositories. The last 8 digits of the hash are displayed. Hover over those digits to see the full hash. You can copy the full hash using the Copy button.

To navigate through the list of image tags, you can use the search and filter bar at the top of the table. In the **Search** field, enter a search term that's part of the image tag name. Use the **Filter** field to filter the image tags by their attributes (EDB Official Release, Location Available, Platform Architecture). Use the **Sort** field to sort the image tags by version, date created, or last pushed date.

Select the name of an image tag to go to the **Image Tag Details** page for that tag.

## Image tag details

The **Image Tag Details** page shows the most detailed information about a specific image tag.

At the top of the page is the name of the image tag. Below that are any Hybrid Manager tags associated with this image tag, which can include the EDB Official tag, the Transparent Data Encryption tags generated by the platform, and any tags you created. Select **Add Tag** to add or remove tags to the image tag and create new tags if needed.

Next are the following:

-   **README**: A textual description of the image repository, which can include any relevant information about the image, such as how to use it, what it contains, and any other details that may be useful.
-   An image attributes panel that displays the following information:
    -   **Version**: The version of the image tag.
    -   **Base Image**: The underlying OS image the image is based on.
    -   **Image SHA**: The SHA256 hash of the image.
    -   **Platform Architecture**: The platform architectures for which the image tag is available, such as X86, AMD64, ARM64, PPC64LE or S390X.
    -   **Last Pushed**: The date and time when the image tag was pushed to the repository.
    -   **Created**: The date and time when the image tag was created.
    -   **Platform Architecture**: The platform architectures for which the image tag is available, such as X86, AMD64, ARM64, PPC64LE or S390X.
    -   **Transparent Data Encryption**: Indicates whether the image tag supports Transparent Data Encryption (TDE).

A field labeled **Deployment Locations** lists the locations where the image tag is available. 

A table shows the extensions that are included in this image tag. Each extension is displayed with its name, version, and description. Use the Search field to search for a specific extension by name or description. You can sort this table by name.

The **Clusters Using This Image Tag** section lists any clusters in the estate that are using this image tag.
