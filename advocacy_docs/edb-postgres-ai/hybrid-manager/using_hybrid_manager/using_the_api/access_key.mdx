title: Access Key

---

An access key provides authentication for users to interact directly with the HCP API. Each access key is linked to a single user and is immutable after creation.

You can create an access key for a machine user or a normal user. The organization owner can manage the access key for a machine user and normal user can manage his own access key.

Each key must have an expiration period between 1 and 365 days, set at creation time. Once an access key expires or if it is lost then you must delete it and create a new one.

| Machine user | 2                | Two access keys, created while the [creating a machine user](../using-hybrid-manager/monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/create_machine_user.mdx). Optionally, can be individually added from **Access keys** tab on machine user's details page using **Create New Key** option. |
| Normal user  | 1                | One access key, [created](<>) and managed by user from their home page.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

An access key can be revoked from user. Revoking the key doesn't affect the role or any other authentication process of the linked user.

## Create your personal access key

1.  Log in to the HCP portal.
2.  From the drop down menu, next to your organization name in the top right of the portal, select **My Account**.
3.  From the My Account page, select the **Access Keys** tab.
4.  From the Access Keys tab, select **Create New Key**.
5.  Provide the **Access Key Name**.
6.  Provide the **Expiry days** in the range of 1 to 365.
7.  Select **Create Key**.

The generated access key is provided to the user.

Copy this access key and save it in a secure location. The access key is available only when you create it. If you lose your access key, you must delete it and create a new one.

You can enable in-app inbox or email notifications so that you're alerted when your personal key is about to expire. For more information, see [Managing notifications](<>).

## Manage access key

You can manage the access keys for a machine user from the **Users** home page.

To view the details of a access key:

1.  From the drop down menu, next to your organization name in the top right of the portal, select **Users Management**.
2.  Select the **Edit** button for the user in the list.
3.  View the **Access Keys** tab on the user's home page. Each row provides the access key details:
    1.  **Name** — Access key name.
    2.  **Access Key** — Access key in half encrypted format.
    3.  **Expiry at** — The expiry date for the access key.
    4.  **Created at** — The creation date for the access key.

To delete a specific key, select **Delete** next to the key. You're prompted to confirm the deletion.

To create a key, select **Create New Key** at the top-right corner of the **Access Keys** tab.

## Use the access key

The HCP API detects if the caller is using an access key in the request. If the caller uses the access key, the API checks:

-   The validity of the access key.
-   The organization of the user requesting access.
-   The user permissions

It then authorizes the access. For more information, see
