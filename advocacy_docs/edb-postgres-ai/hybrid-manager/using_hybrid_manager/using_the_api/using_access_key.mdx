description: How to use the Access key to authenticate the requests.
---

To interact with the GenAI Builder API, you must authenticate your requests using an access key. This key can be provided in the request header as either a bearer token or an `x-access-key`.

## 1. Generate an Access Key

[Create an access key](access_key.mdx) in Hybrid Manager via the UI or CLI.

**Important:** Store the key securely, as it won't be shown again after generation.

## 2. Use the Access Key in API Requests

The base URL for the GenAI Builder API endpoints is typically structured as `${BASE_URL}/launchpad/apps/genai-builder/api`. Here `${BASE_URL}` represents the domain or IP address of your Hybrid Manager instance.

You can use tools like `curl` to test your API access. The access key must be sent in the HTTP header in one of two ways:

- **As a Bearer Token:** `Authorization: Bearer ${access_key}`
- **As an x-access-key:** `x-access-key: ${access_key}`

Here's an example using the `x-access-key` header to retrieve a list of users:

```bash
curl -H "x-access-key: ${access_key}" \
     -k "${BASE_URL}/launchpad/apps/genai-builder/api/users"
```

Where, 
- `${access_key}` is your actual access key.
- `${BASE_URL}` is your domain or IP address of your Hybrid Manager instance.
  
**Note:** The `-k` option allows `curl` to work with self-signed TLS certificates. Remove it if you're using a trusted certificate.

Example API Response: Retrieving Users

Upon a successful request to the users endpoint as shown in the `curl` example above, you might receive a JSON response similar to this:

```JSON
{
    "users": [
        {
            "user_id": "d9e03312-638d-52b6-8d6f-f5b99f5f2480",
            "created_at": "2025-06-25T19:27:32.642823Z",
            "updated_at": "2025-06-26T08:50:42.122521Z",
            "organizations": [
                "060e360b-0364-47b6-adc2-f62ac0feae41"
            ],
            "name": "owner@mycompany.com",
            "email": "owner@mycompany.com"
        }
    ]
}
```
