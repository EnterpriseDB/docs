`edbctl` is a command line tool to manage HM resources and perform database cluster operations. 

## Prerequisites

To use `edbctl` you must download the package from  `pgai-platform` repository.

Before you begin the installation process:

### Set up the pgai-platform repository.

Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

To determine if your repository exists, enter this command:

dnf repolist | grep pgai-platform

If no output is generated, the repository isn't installed.

To set up the `pgai-platform` repository:

1. Go to [repositories page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos).

1. Select the button that provides access to the repository.

1. Select the platform and software that you want to download.

1. Follow the instructions for setting up the repository.

 
The command to install the edbctl package:

```
<package-manager> install edbctl
```

Where `<package-manager>` is the package manager used with your operating system.

| Package manager | Operating system                 |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| dnf             | RHEL 8/9 and derivatives         |
| yum             | RHEL 7 and derivatives, CentOS 7 |
| apt-get         | Debian and derivatives           |

For example, to install `edbctl` on RHEL 8 platform:

```
sudo dnf -y install edbctl
```

After installing the package, configure an access key using the "credential" command to proceed using this tool. These credentials allows you to access the supported HM resources and manage them using the edbctl CLI. The CLI supports various commands for managing projects, clusters, backups, credentials, and more.

## Examples

```
edbctl credential import-access-key --name user1 --access-key baak_xyz --address http://localhost:8080
edbctl config set context_project "Adaptable Chameleon"
```
