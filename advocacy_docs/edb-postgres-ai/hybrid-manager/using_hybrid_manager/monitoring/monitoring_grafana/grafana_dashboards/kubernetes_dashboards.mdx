description: Learn how to monitor Kubernetes using dashboards with Hybrid Manager.
---

These dashboards provide insights into the health and performance of the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure that powers the Hybrid Manager. 

These are prebuilt dashboards called [Kubernetes mixins](https://github.com/kubernetes-monitoring/kubernetes-mixin) from Grafana's official library.

## Kubernetes / API server

!!!note

    This dashboard only displays data for on-premises Hybrid Manager (HM) deployments, as Grafana requires node-level access to the API server.

**Description:** Monitors the performance and availability of the Kubernetes API server, a critical component for all interactions with the cluster. 

**Metrics** These metrics include read and write availability, work queue latency, read and write errors, resource utilization, among others.

**Usage:** Use this to identify API latency issues or availability problems.

## Kubernetes / Compute Resources / \*

![Compute Resources by Node and Pods](../../../../images/k8s_compute_dashboard.png)

Compute resources are displayed in multiple dashboards that provide different views: **Cluster** , **Namespace (Pods)**, **Namespace (Workloads)**, **Node (Pods)**, **Pod** or **Workload**.

-   **Cluster** displays resource utilization for the entire Kubernetes cluster, as well as utilization per namespace. 

-   **Namespace (Pods)** displays resource utilization that you can filter by Kubernetes namespaces, focusing on pod/service consumption.

-   **Namespace (Workloads)** displays resource utilization that you can filter by Kubernetes namespaces and by workload type (deployments, daemonsets, StatefulSets, etc.), focusing on individual workload consumption.

-   **Node (Pods)** shows resource utilization that you can filter by individual Kubernetes nodes, broken down by the pods running on them. 

-   **Pod** provides detailed resource usage for individual Kubernetes pods in a specific namespace. 

-   **Workload** shows detailed resource usage for a specific Kubernetes workload (e.g., a deployment workload) in a specific namespace. 

**Description:** Shows the resource utilization at the Kubernetes cluster level. Each of the subdashboards presents the data differently, focussing on different Kubernetes levels, while offering different filtering options.

**Metrics:** Metrics include CPU, memory, bandwith, packet rates, IOPS, throughput, and more.

**Usage:** Use these dashboards to understand the resource consumption across all workloads, identify resource-intensive applications or teams, understand the resource footprint of specific workloads in an aplication, of specific pods in a node, troubleshoot performance issues with specific application instances, monitor the performance of a particular application component.

## Kubernetes / Kubelet

![Kubelet dashboard](../../../../images/k8s_kubelet_dashboard.png)

**Description:**  Monitors the health and performance of the [Kubelet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/) service running on each Kubernetes node, responsible for managing containers. You can see the aggregated performance of all kubelets, filter by kubelet instance and drill down into specific kubelet operations.

**Metrics:** Metrics include kubelet count, pods count, countainers count, operation rates, operations durations, pod lifecycle operation rates, operation error rates, and more.

**Usage:** Use this to identify node-level agent activity, operation behavior, latency and troubleshoot performance issues on a particular node.

## Kubernetes / Networking / \*

![Networking overall cluster dashboard](../../../../images/k8s_networking_cluster_dashboard.png)

Networking resources are displayed in multiple dashboards that provide different views: **Cluster** , **Namespace (Pods)**, **Namespace (Workloads)**, **Pod** or **Workload**.

-   **Cluster** displays network utilization for the entire Kubernetes cluster, as well as per namespace.

-   **Namespace (Pods)** shows network traffic metrics that you can filter by Kubernetes namespaces, focusing on the pods within that namespace. 

-   **Namespace (Workloads)** shows network traffic metrics that you can filter by Kubernetes namespaces and by workload type (deployments, daemonsets, StatefulSets, etc.), focusing on individual workload traffic.

-   **Pod** provides detailed network traffic metrics for individual Kubernetes pods in a specific namespace.

-   **Workload** shows detailed network traffic metrics for a specific Kubernetes workload (e.g., a deployment workload).

**Description:** Shows the network usage at the Kubernetes cluster level. Each of the subdashboards presents the data differently, focussing on different Kubernetes levels, while offering different filtering options.

**Metrics:** Metrics include rates of bytes received and transmitted, rates of packets received and transmitted, receive and transmit bandwith, and more.

**Usage:** Use these dashboards to understand overall network communication patterns, traffic, throughput and potential bottlenecks, analyze network patterns for specific applications, understand the resource footprint of specific workloads in an aplication, troubleshoot network connectivity issues with specific pods in an application, or monitor the network performance of a particular application component.

## Kubernetes / Persistent Volumes

![Persistent Volumes dashboard](../../../../images/k8s_persistentvolumes_dashboard.png)

**Description:** Monitors the usage and performance of persistent volumes ([PVs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)) in the Kubernetes cluster. You can filter the results per namespace and persistent volume claim ([PVCs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)).

**Metrics:** Metrics include free and used space.

**Usage:** Use this to identify storage bottlenecks, capacity issues, plan for storage expansions and monitor storage costs.

## Kubernetes / StatefulSets

![StatefulSets dashboard](../../../../images/k8s_stateful_dashboard.png)

**Description:** Provides specific monitoring for Kubernetes [StatefulSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/), which manage stateful applications. You can filter results by namespace (=application) and StatefulSet name.

**Metrics:** Metrics include CPU, memory, and network consumption, as well as replicas.

**Usage:** Use this to monitor the stability, performance and resource consumption of your stateful applications, as well as track whether your stateful applications have met their desired replicas.

## Kubernetes CoreDNS

![CoreDNS dashboard](../../../../images/k8s_coreDNS_dashboard.png)

**Description:** Monitors the performance and health of the CoreDNS service, which provides DNS resolution within the Kubernetes cluster, enabling communication within the pods and services.

**Metrics:** The metrics include DNS request rates by protocol, by query type, by DNS zone, by size, by response code, by response duration, by response size, among others.
**Usage** Use this to monitor the reliability and efficiency of the CoreDNS component and identify any discovery and communication issues among services.
