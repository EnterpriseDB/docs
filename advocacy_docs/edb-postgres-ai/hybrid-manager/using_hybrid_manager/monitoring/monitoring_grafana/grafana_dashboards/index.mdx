The Grafana service shipped with Hybrid Manager (HM) comes with a number of default dashboards designed to monitor different Hybrid Manager resources. Alternatively, create your own custom dashboard to display specific data that serves your organization's requirements.

## Default Grafana dashboards

The Grafana service shipped with Hybrid Manager comes with a number of default dashboards that are grouped into the following categories: 

-   [Kubernetes dashboards](kubernetes_dashboards.mdx)
-   [Loki dashboards](loki_dashboards.mdx)
-   [Postgres dashboards](postgres_dashboards.mdx)
-   [Telemetry dashboards](telemetry_dashboards.mdx)
-   [Other dashboards](other_dashboards.mdx)

!!!note

    The dashboard descriptions offer a generalized and exemplified overview of the default dashboards included with Hybrid Manager's Grafana. The availability of specific metrics depends on your environment.

## Custom dashboards

See Grafana's documentation to [create your own dashboard](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/build-dashboards/create-dashboard/).

!!!warning

    Ensure you have a backup of any customized Grafana dashboards and/or have them stored on a version control repository. Any customized Grafana dashboards are deleted whenever the Grafana instance is updated or redeployed, for example, due to a Hybrid Manager upgrade, node Kubernetes version upgrade or general node failure.
