## Power Consumption: Power Usage & Carbon Footprint

![Power usage and carbon footprint dashboard](../../../../images/power_emission_dashboard.png)

**Description:** Monitors the energy consumption and estimated carbon footprint of the Hybrid Manager (HM) infrastructure. Use this for tracking and potentially optimizing environmental impact.

This dashboard was designed by EDB following a similar procedure as re:cinq's [Cloud CPU Energy Consumption](https://re-cinq.com/blog/cloud-cpu-energy-consumption) calculation methology and uses the freely available power measurements from [TEADS dataset](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DqYgQnEDLQVQm5acMAhLgHLD8xXCG9BIrk-_Nv6jF3k/edit?gid=504755275#gid=504755275) as source data.

**Metrics:** Power consumption (in Watts or Kilowatts), estimated carbon footprint and estimated power cost, broken down into graphs for the last hour, 24 hours, or 30 days.

**Usage:** Allows you to visualize the environmental impact of the HM infrastructure, track trends in energy usage, and potentially identify areas for optimization to reduce costs and environmental impact.

## Infrastructure: cert-manager

![Cert-manager dashboard](../../../../images/cert-manager_dashboard.png)

**Description:** Monitors the health and performance of [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/), a Kubernetes add-on to automate the management and issuance of TLS certificates. Use this to ensure the proper functioning of certificate management within Hybrid Manager.

**Metrics:** Number of issued certificates, certificate request status (pending, ready, failed), expiry times of certificates, and more.

**Usage:** Helps ensure that TLS certificates within Hybrid Manager are being managed correctly and that applications relying on them have valid and up-to-date certificates. Identify potential issues with certificate issuance or renewal before they cause outages.

## Infrastructure: Velero Stats

![Velero dashboard](../../../../images/velero_dashboard.png)

**Description:** Monitors the health and performance of [Velero](https://velero.io/docs/v1.7/), a backup and restore tool for Kubernetes resources and persistent volumes. Use this to track the status and success of your backups within the HM.

**Metrics:** Number of backups created, number of restores performed, status of backup and restore operations (completed, failed, in progress), backup size, restore duration, errors encountered during backups or restores, schedule status.

**Usage:** Provides visibility into the backup and restore operations within Hybrid Manager. Allows you to verify the success of backups, monitor restore processes, and identify any issues with your disaster recovery strategy.
