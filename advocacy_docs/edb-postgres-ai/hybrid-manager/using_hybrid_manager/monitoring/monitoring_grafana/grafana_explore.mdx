Grafana offers an **Explore** option which allows you to query logs gathered by Loki.

To query the logs from a specific cluster: 

1.  Obtain your [cluster's ID and namespace](../../cluster_management/manage-clusters/trace-clusters.mdx#using-hm-to-collate-the-cluster-to-its-namespace), select `cnp_instance_id` 

2.  In the **Label filters** dropdown, select **cnp_instance_id**. 

3.  In the **Select value** dropdown, select the pods ID. 

4.  Craft your query to look for certain key words in that instance's logs, for example "error" or "exception.
