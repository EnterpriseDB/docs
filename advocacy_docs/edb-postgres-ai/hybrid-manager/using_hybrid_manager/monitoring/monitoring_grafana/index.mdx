Grafana allows you to visualize and analyze metrics about PG AI Hybrid Manager deployments, HM-managed database clusters and any other external clusters connected to the Hybrid Manager.
You can monitor performance, troubleshoot issues, and gain insights into resource utilization.

For HM-managed clusters, Grafana gathers metrics out of the box. For external clusters, you must first install the PG AI Agent as explained in [Monitoring external databases](../mon_ext_dbs).

## Grafana support

Grafana dashboards are supported as follows:

-   HM-managed clusters &mdash; full support out of the box.

-   Self-managed clusters &mdash; partial support after the cluster is connected via the PG AI Agent. 

-   CNP clusters &mdash; partial support after the cluster is connected via the PG AI Agent.

-   RDS clusters &mdash; partial support after the cluster is connected via Kubernetes secret.

## Accessing Grafana

You can access the built-in Grafana instance via the [Launchpad](../../hm_overview/using-portal/#launchpad).

## Filtering results

Every cluster managed by the Hybrid Manager has an ID, which can be traced back to a namespace and its pods. You can filter and analyze metrics on Grafana by cluster ID (equivalent to a namespace), or by pod name to perform troubleshooting and resource planning operations. 

See [Tracing clusters back to their Kubernetes resources](../../cluster_management/manage-clusters/trace-clusters.mdx) to understand how Kubernetes infrastructure relates to your cluster. More specifically: 

-   Understand how to obtain the [ID and namespace for a cluster](../../cluster_management/manage-clusters/trace-clusters/#using-hm-to-collate-the-cluster-to-its-namespace).
-   Understand how to recognize the [pods](../../cluster_management/manage-clusters/trace-clusters/#pods) in a cluster/namespace.
