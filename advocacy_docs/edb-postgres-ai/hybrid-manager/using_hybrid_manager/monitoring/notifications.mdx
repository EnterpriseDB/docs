title: Notifications

---

With EDB Postgres AI, you can customize the types of notifications you want to receive. There are two types of notification channels:

**User notifications** channels &mdash; you can receive notifications via email, in-app inbox, or both. These notifications are for all users who have enabled them and if their role allows it.

**System notifications** channels &mdash; you can receive notifications via email (mail group), webhook, pager duty, or any combination. These notifications are designed to be triggered once per event, primarily to automate tasks within your organization.

The user's role in the Hybrid Manager determines the extent of their access to notification preferences. The notifications are categorized into the following preference sections:

-   Account &mdash; only for user notification channels
-   Global &mdash; for both user and system notification channels
-   Projects &mdash; for both user and system notification channels

The notifications under the Account preference section are:

-   New project role assigned to you
-   Project role unassigned from you
-   The personal access key is about to expire

The notifications under the Global preference section are:

-   New project created
-   The machine access key is about to expire

!!! note

    This section is visible only to the organization owner.

The notifications under the Projects preference section are:

-   Active cluster paused
-   Paused cluster reactivated

## Configuring Notifications

Project owners/editors and organization owners/admins can enable/disable notifications for the events visible to them. They can receive notifications in the in-app inbox, by email, or both.

Notification settings made by a user apply only to that user. If an email notification is enabled, the email is sent to the email address associated with the user's login.

System notification channels can be configured at the global level by the organisation owner or at the project level by the project owner. By default, each organisation's project inherits the global-level system notifications channel. However, you can enable/disable or re-configure the system notifications channel at the project level to override the default settings.

These steps show how to configure the system notification channels at Organization-level:
