You can monitor your Amazon Web Service (AWS) Relational Database Service deployments with your EDB AI Hybrid Manager (HM).

## Prerequisites

You must have access to the Kubernetes environment where the HM resides, and also have sufficient administrator privileges to change the settings on the entire HM cluster.

This is different than other external database monitoring situations with HM, such as [self-managed](../mon_with_agent) deployments of Postgres, where less privileges are required.

You must also ensure that the user credentials stored in the Kubernetes secret (beacon-csp-credentials) have sufficient permissions for the AWS RDS environment being monitored. Without these permissions, the system cannot retrieve all available metrics.

To do this, you need to obtain an AWS access key of an IAM user with the following minimal permissions:

```
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "AllowInstanceAndLogDescriptions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
                "rds:DescribeDBLogFiles"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:rds:*:*:db:*"
            ]
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowMaintenanceDescriptions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "rds:DescribePendingMaintenanceActions"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowGettingCloudWatchMetrics",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "cloudwatch:GetMetricData"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowRDSUsageDescriptions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "rds:DescribeAccountAttributes"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowQuotaDescriptions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "servicequotas:GetServiceQuota"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowInstanceTypeDescriptions",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "AllowInstanceFilterByTags",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "tag:GetResources"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Setting up the Agent to monitor AWS RDS deployments on Hybrid Manager

The process of setting up the Agent to monitor all your AWS RDS deployments on Hybrid Manager (HM) involves the following steps.

!!! Note

    Once you register an RDS region, the system adds every database you have in that RDS region. This could result in several resources being added to your Estate. They are all under one project, so you either have access as a user to all the RDS databases or not.

1.  Add your `beacon-csp-credentials` secret.

    Add your beacon-csp-credentials secret in your HM's Kubernetes cluster's `upm-beacon` namespace:

    ```
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
    name: beacon-csp-credentials
    namespace: upm-beacon
    stringData:
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: replace_with_your_access_key_id
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: replace_with_your_secret_access_key
    AWS_REGION: example-us-east-1
    BEACON_PROVIDER_AWS_CONSTANT_REGIONS: example-us-east-1
    BEACON_PROVIDER_AWS_CONSTANT_PROJECT_ID: your_project_id
    BEACON_AGENT_PROVIDERS: appliance,aws
    BEACON_PROVIDER_AWS_MODE: constant
    BEACON_PROVIDER_AWS_CONSTANT_SERVICES: rds
    EOF
    ```
2.  Restart the Agent and external metrics receiver:

    ```
    kubectl -n upm-beacon rollout restart deployment upm-beacon-agent-k8s
    kubectl -n upm-beacon rollout restart deployment upm-beacon-external-metrics-receiver
    ```

You now see your AWS RDS deployments on your **Estate** page.
After the databases start populating, you are presented with a total of five metrics:

-   CPU

-   Network Throughput

-   Connections

-   Disk IOPS

-   Disk throughput

## Disabling AWS RDS Monitoring in Hybrid Manager

You can turn off the monitoring of your AWS RDS deployments using the following steps.

1.  Delete your `beacon-csp-credentials` secret:

    ```
    kubectl -n upm-beacon rollout restart deployment upm-beacon-agent-k8s
    ```

2.  Restart the Agent and external metrics receiver:

    ```
    kubectl -n upm-beacon rollout restart deployment upm-beacon-agent-k8s
    kubectl -n upm-beacon rollout restart deployment upm-beacon-external-metrics-receiver
    ```

You are now no longer seeing your AWS RDS deployments on your Estate and are no longer monitoring them with HM.
