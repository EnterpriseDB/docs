To monitor self-managed external Postgres instances from the **PG AI Hybrid Manager** that are deployed on bare metal or virtual machines, you must first install the PG AI Agent. The agent provides monitoring and observability metrics to your PG AI Hybrid Manager.

On completing this guide you will have Monitoring, Query Diagnostics and Recommendations for your self-managed Postgres instance.

1.  [Create an OS user to run the Agent](agent_os_user.mdx)
2.  [Prepare your database](prepare_database.mdx)
3.  [Create a machine user](create_machine_user.mdx)
4.  [Install the Agent](install_agent.mdx)
5.  [Configure the Agent](configure_agent.mdx)
6.  [Run the Agent](run_agent.mdx)
7.  [Configure the Agent to run as a service](run_as_service.mdx)

For extra help with the necessary administrative tasks needed to configure the agent, see [Administrative tasks](admin_tasks.mdx).

See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.mdx) for help with general troubleshooting and [Data security and sovereignity](data_sovereignity.mdx) to understand how your data is stored by the Agent.
