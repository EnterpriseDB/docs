---

We recommend that you create a dedicated operating system user to configure and run the agent.
This is a security best practice because it avoids granting permissions to the agent that are not necessary for its function.

!!! Note Testing and Development

    Running the agent as either the root user or the Postgres user can be convenient for testing and development because both these users have all the permissions the agent needs.
    However, the root user has full access to your operating system and the Postgres user has full access to all your Postgres data as well as superuser access to Postgres itself.
    As such, running as either of these users in long-lived or production environments is strongly discouraged.

To create a new user:

```shell
sudo useradd <agent_os_user>
```

We recommend that the agent OS user is added to the Postgres user's group.
This facilitates granting the agent access to the Postgres log files later in this guide.

```shell
usermod -aG postgres <agent_os_user>
```
