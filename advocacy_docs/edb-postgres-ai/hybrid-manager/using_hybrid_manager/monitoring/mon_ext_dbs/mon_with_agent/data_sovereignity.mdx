title: Data security and sovereignity

---

When you deploy the Agent to monitor your external databases with the Hybrid Manager, you retain control over the data collected for monitoring and assessment, aligning with your security and compliance requirements.

## Limited data collection

The Agent gathers the following data:

-   general database metadata to display metrics in the **Estate** view.

    For Postgres databases:

-   database logs and metrics to provide observability features via the [Console](../../monitoring_console) and [Grafana](../../monitoring_grafana).

    For Oracle databases:

-   database data to generate the automatic assessment of migration complexity and level of effort displayed in **Estate** > **Migrations**.

-   schema DDL for eventual retrieval and use by Migration Portal if you decide to use that tooling for schema conversion.

!!!note

    Currently, migration assessment data and schema DDL data are collected only for Oracle databases. Subsequent releases will also gather migration assessment and schema DDL data for external Postgres and cloud service provider databases.

We don't collect data beyond what is strictly necessary for these purposes.

## Data storage location

Your collected data stays within your chosen environment. The Hybrid Manager respects your data sovereignty. For example, if you have deployed the Hybrid Manager on your own premises, all collected data from your monitored databases remains within your on-premise infrastructure. If your Hybrid Manager instance is deployed on a cloud platform like EKS, the collected data will reside securely within your specific cloud environment.
