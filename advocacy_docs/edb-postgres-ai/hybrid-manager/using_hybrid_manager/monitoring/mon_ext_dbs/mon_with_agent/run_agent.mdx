Run the agent using the following command: 

```
beacon-agent
```

The agent will start sending data to the EDB Postgres AI Hybrid Manager. Follow the logs to monitor the data ingestion process.

After a few minutes, you should see the data from the agent in the EDB Postgres AI Platform with Hybrid Control Plane. Navigate to the **Estate** page to see the data from the agent.

    The Agent detects schema changes to tables and columns while running. However, changes to views or procedures won't be detected until you restart the Agent.

For production usage you should [configure the agent to run as a service](run_as_service.mdx).
