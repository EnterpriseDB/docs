Install and configure the Agent to monitor databases in your **Estate** page in the Hybrid Manager.

## Prerequisites

-   You created a machine user and access key with the `estate ingester` role assigned to it. See [Creating a machine user](create_machine_user.mdx).
-   You need the project ID for the project where you want to monitor the database. To obtain the ID, navigate to your project and fetch the ID from the URL displayed in the browser.

## Enable your system to download packages

Enable the system where you are planning on running the agent to download packages from the EDB repositories for EDB Postgres AI.

Locate your EDB subscription token on the [EnterpriseDB repos download page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).

Using the retrieved subscription token, set an environmental variable (`EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN`) to the token's value. Also set an environmental variable for your EDB subscription type (`EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TYPE`) to one of `standard` or `enterprise` depending on which plan you are signed up to:

```shell
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=<your-repos-token>
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TYPE=<your-subscription-type>
```

Depending on your operating system, run the following command to give your system the capacity to download packages from the EDB repositories:

For RHEL-like or SLES:

```shell
curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TYPE/setup.rpm.sh" | sudo -E bash
```

For Debian or Ubuntu:

```shell
curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TYPE/setup.deb.sh" | sudo -E bash
```

## Install the Agent package

Install the `beacon-agent` package from EDB's repositories:

For RHEL-like:

```shell
dnf install beacon-agent
```

Or if dnf isn't available:

```shell
yum install beacon-agent
```

For SLES:

```shell
zypper install beacon-agent
```

For Debian or Ubuntu:

```
apt install beacon-agent
```
