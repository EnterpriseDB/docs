navTitle: Fine-tuning

The template provided in [Configuring the Agent](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/configure_agent/#prepare-a-configuration-file) enables all monitoring features. You can fine-tune which features are enabled.

## Time-series metrics (the "Monitoring" tab)

The `general.metrics.push` section of the configuration file controls the pushing of time series metrics back to the Prometheus instance in the Hybrid Manager.
These metrics populate the **Monitoring** tab. You can disable this by setting `general.metrics.push.enabled` to `false`.

## Postgres logs (the "Logs" tab)

!!!Warning Known issue: viewing logs in Hybrid Manager
Logs collected using the agent do not currently display correctly on the "Logs" tab.
However, they are stored correctly, and they can be accessed through Grafana or downloaded from the "Logs" tab.

A partial workaround for this issue is to configure `log_destination = 'stderr'` in `postgresql.conf. 
This will cause log content to appear in the UI, but log entries containing line breaks will appear as multiple log entries in the UI.
!!!

The collection of logs is enabled by setting `general.metrics.push.include_logs` to `true` and can be disabled at the agent level by setting this value to `false`.
In addition, `logs.disabled` must be set to `false` for each entry in `provider.onprem.databases` for which you wish to collect Postgres logs.

By default, the agent attempts to discover the location of the log files by calling the Postgres function `pg_current_logfile()`.
If you wish to explicitely specify the location of the log files because, for example, you configured your Postgres instance to store logs at a different location, substitute `<logs_directory>` with the path to the directory where you are storing log files.

For example, to collect logs with the extension `.log` from filepath `/var/log/postgres-lc` you can use the pattern `/var/log/postgres-lc/*.log`

```yaml
databases:
  - resource_id: selfmanaged_postgres_1
  ...
  logs:
    disabled: false
    mode: file
    file:
      paths: <logs_directory>/*log
```

## Diagnostics ("Query Diagnostics" and "Recommendations" tabs)

The `metrics.stats` section under each entry in `provider.onprem.databases` controls the collection of more detailed diagnostic data for query analysis and optimization.

You can disable all such data collection by setting `metrics.stats.enabled` to `false`. Alternatively you can enable or disable each individual element by setting the appropriate `enabled` parameter.

-   `metrics.stats.wait_states` controls the collect of query data based on sampling the session state from EDB Wait States.
-   `metrics.stats.query_text` controls the collection of query statistics from EDB Stat Monitor. 

If both options above are disabled, the **Query Diagnostics** tab will be disabled.

-   `metrics.stats.recommendations` controls the collection of index and statistics recommendations from EDB Query Advisor. If disabled the **Recommendations** tab will be blank.
-   `metrics.stats.query_text` controls the collection of query texts from both EDB Wait States and EDB Stat Monitor. If disabled, no query texts will be collected and you will only see query ID in **Query Diagnostics**.
