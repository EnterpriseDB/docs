navTitle: Adding usage reporting

---

You can complement your monitoring efforts by providing EDB with valuable insights into product usage, all from a unified Agent deployment. When enabled, the Agent collects basic usage data to enable EDB to better understand our customers. It doesn't send any data to EDB until you enable it.

!!!info Not using the Hybrid Manager?
   This page is for users who have their databases monitored by Hybrid Manager. If you are not using Hybrid Manager and need to configure usage reporting for a stand-alone database, refer to [Enabling usage reporting for stand-alone databases](/tools/agent/stand_alone/).

## In Internet-connected environments

1.  In the [agent configuration example](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/configure_agent/#prepare-a-configuration-file), the `beacon_agent.yaml` file already has `general.metrics.usage.output.file.enabled` set to `true`. This allows the agent to save a local copy of the usage data in a file, `beacon_usage.json`.

1.  Review this file to ensure that the information is accurate and does not contain any data you are not happy to share with EDB.

1.  Enable reporting to EDB by setting `general.metrics.usage.output.http.enabled` to `true`. 

## In air-gapped environments 

1.  In the [agent configuration example](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/configure_agent/#prepare-a-configuration-file), the `beacon_agent.yaml` file already has `general.metrics.usage.output.file.enabled` set to `true`. This allows the agent to save a local copy of the usage data in a file, `beacon_usage.json`.

1.  Review this file to verify that the information is accurate and does not contain any data you are not happy to share with EDB.

1.  Copy the `beacon_usage.json` report file to a machine that has internet access.
