navTitle: Usage reporting

---

The agent collects basic usage data to enable EDB to better understand our customers. It doesn't send any data to EDB until you enable it.

Once the agent is running, the `general.metrics.usage.output.file.enabled` setting (set to `true` in the template above) allows the agent to save a local copy of the usage data in a file, `beacon_usage.json`.

Review this file to verify that the information is accurate and does not contain any data you are not happy to share with EDB. Then, enable reporting to EDB by setting `general.metrics.usage.output.http.enabled` to `true`.
