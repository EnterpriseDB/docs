description: Learn how to configure the beacon agent for monitoring with PG AI Hybrid Manager.
---

Configure the agent (deployed as `beacon-agent`) to allow it to connect to your Hybrid Manager and fetch monitoring data from the source database.

You can also use the agent to [get your Oracle database ready](../../../../migration/migration_guides/agent_for_oracle_readiness.mdx) for migration and extract schemas for conversion.

Change to the [OS user you previously created](../agent_os_user.mdx) to perform the agent configuration.

## Set environment variables

Ensure that following environment variables are available in your configuration.
These environment variables must be permanently available as they are required each time the agent starts.

!!! Info

    It is possible to set these values directly in the config files, but as they contain secrets it is generally advisable to handle them as environment variables managed through a secrets manager.

1.  Set `BEACON_AGENT_ACCESS_KEY` to the access key you obtained from the console when you [created a machine user](../create_machine_user.mdx).

2.  Set `$DSN` to the Data Source Name (DSN) to which you wish to connect.
    For example, to connect as user `postgres` authenticated with password `password` to a database `hr` on port 5432 you would specify:

    ```
    postgresql://postgres:password@localhost:5432/hr
    ```

    If you plan to connect to more than one database with this agent, you can specify multiple such variables, for example $DSN1, $DSN2. 
    You can use any name you wish for these variables because they will be referenced by name in the configuration file.

## Prepare a configuration file

1.  Create a Beacon configuration directory in your home directory:

    ```shell
    mkdir ${HOME}/.beacon
    ```

    !!!Note
    If the location specified above is not convenient, you also use either:

    - `/etc/beacon`
    - The directory from which you execute any `beacon-agent` command. 
    
    The agent looks for its configuration file starting with `/etc/beacon`, then `${HOME}/.beacon`. As a final fallback, it searches the directory from which it's executed.
    !!!

2.  Inside this directory, create a new file `beacon_agent.yaml`

    ```shell
    touch .beacon/beacon_agent.yaml
    ```

3.  Copy and paste the following template into the new file. This template is designed to enable all monitoring options.

    ```yaml

    The placeholders denoted by `<>` should be replaced with appropriate values.
    Refer to [Parameter reference](../configure_agent.mdx#parameter-reference) for explanations of each parameter and how to obtain the appropriate value.

## Validate the configuration file

Run the following command. 
This will validate the credentials provided in the previous steps by making a test connection to the Hybrid Manager server and print a summary of your configuration.

```shell
beacon-agent config 
```

If the connection succeeds a summary of the connection details will be printed. 
If any error are shown in the output, it must be resolved before proceeding.

!!! note

    If the **Connectivity** check fails with a message like `failed to verify certificate x509...` this likely means that the system on which you are running the agent does not trust the certificate used to sign the server certificate.
    This is likely symptomatic of an issue with root certificate distribution and should be raised with the team that manages your infrastructure.
    If you have a copy of the root certificate, you can provide the path to the root certificate by setting `agent.root_ca_path` and `general.metrics.push.root_ca_path`.
    Re-run `beacon-agent config` after setting these parameters to check the the issue is resolved.

    If the the **Connectivity** check fails with a message like `connection reset by peer` this generally means the agent cannot reach the specified `<beacon-server>` because the URL is incorrect or there is a firewall preventing connection.

**The agent is now configured, you may proceed to [run the agent](../run_agent.mdx) or [configure the agent to run as a service](../run_as_service.mdx).** Once your agent is running, consider [configuring usage reporting](usage_reporting.mdx).
