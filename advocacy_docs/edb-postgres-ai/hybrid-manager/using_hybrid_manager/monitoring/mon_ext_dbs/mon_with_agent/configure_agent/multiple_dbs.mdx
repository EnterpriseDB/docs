To leverage full observability capabilities, EDB recommends deploying one Agent per host machine with self-managed database clusters. 

Then, you can configure the Agent to connect to multiple databases on the same host by adding a dedicated database enty to the list.

```yaml
databases:
      - resource_id: selfmanaged_postgres_1
        disable_host_association: false
        dsn: "$DSN1"
        ...
      - resource_id: selfmanaged_postgres_2
        disable_host_association: true
        dsn: "$DSN2"
        ...
```

While a single Agent instance can track databases across different host machines, that setup would provide limited host-level metrics for databases not on the same machine as the Agent.

!!! Note

    Currently monitoring data is only collected from the database specified in the DSN. For example if you specify the `postgres` database then the database size will only reflect the size of this database.
    To monitor other databases within the same Postgres instance you must specify them individually in the same way as specifying multiple instances.
