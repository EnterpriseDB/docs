title: Running the Agent as a service
navTitle: Configure Beacon Agent to run as a service

---

For continuous metric streaming and to ensure your database remains visible in your Hybrid Manager estate, configure the agent to run as a service. This allows it to start automatically on system startup and restart after any errors.

If you don't set up the agent as a service, it will only stream metrics when you manually run it. Furthermore, your database will disappear from your Hybrid Manager's **Estate** 72 hours after the agent stops streaming. 

Ensure you've completed agent installation and configuration before setting it up as a service.

!!!note

    Future versions of the agent package may set this up automatically.

This example configures Beacon Agent to run on an RHEL 9 machine. However, we provide operating system aids so you know when to replace the values.

\!!! Environment variables
    You must ensure that any environment variables referenced in the agent configuration file are accessible to the service at runtime.

1.  Create a new file using your text editor of choice. This example command uses the vi editor:

    ```
    sudo vi /usr/lib/systemd/system/beacon-agent.service
    ```

    Other default system directories on AWS EC2 instances are: 

    | Operating system | Default system directory                     |
    | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
    | RHEL             | /usr/lib/systemd/system/beacon-agent.service |
    | Rocky Linux      | /usr/lib/systemd/system/beacon-agent.service |
    | AlmaLinux        | /usr/lib/systemd/system/beacon-agent.service |
    | Ubuntu           | /etc/systemd/system/beacon-agent.service     |
    | Debian           | /lib/systemd/system/beacon-agent.service     |

2.  Paste the following template into the created `beacon-agent.service` file and replace the information in placeholders `< >`.

    ```
    # TEMPLATE 

    [Unit]
    Description=Beacon Agent

    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple

    User=<user>

    WorkingDirectory=</home/user/>

    ExecStart=</usr/local/bin/beacon-agent>

    Restart=on-failure
    RestartSec=60

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    | Service settings    | Placeholder to replace          | Guidelines                                                                                                        |
    | ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `User=`             | `<user>`                        | Provide the name of the system user which will run the Beacon Agent.                                              |
    | `WorkingDirectory=` | `</home/user/>`                 | Set the working directory to where you stored the `.beacon` directory. The path depends on the operating system.  |
    | `ExecStart=`        | `</usr/local/bin/beacon-agent>` | Provide the path to the directory where the Beacon Agent was installed. The path depends on the operating system. |

3.  Run the following commands to reload, enable, and start your new service. These commands apply to all mentioned operating systems:

    ```
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable beacon-agent.service
    sudo systemctl start beacon-agent.service
    ```

4.  Your agent should now be running as a service. Check on the logs by running the following command:

    ```
    journalctl -u beacon-agent.service
    ```
