If you are having issues configuring the agent or are getting errors when trying to run it, this page will help you troubleshoot. Test the agentâ€™s functionalities in an isolated way to narrow down the source of the issue. 

## Testing connectivity from the Agent to HCP

To ensure there's a connection between the Agent and the Hybrid Control Plane, run the Beacon Agent:

```
beacon-agent setup
```

If the output displays no errors, your connection to the Hybrid Control Plane is working properly, and the issue could have to do with the connection to your databases. 

If the output displays errors, your connection to the Hybrid Control Plane is not working properly. Check the syntax of the YAML file, the access key, the CA path and contents, DSN string, project ID one after the other to ensure the settings are correct.
