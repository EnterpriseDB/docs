## Restoring a Postgres backup

You can use any of the following options to perform a restore:

-   The PGAIHM web UI
-   The API
-   The CLI

Use the following steps to restore a Postgres cluster:

## Restoring from the PGAIHM web UI cluster restore feature

1.  Select the **Backups** tab to view existing backup that you can restore from.  The following fields are available:

| Name       | Description                                        |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Status     | The current status of the backup.                  |
| Name       | The name of the backup.                            |
| Start Time | The time the backup started.                       |
| Stop Time  | The time the backup stopped.                       |
| Duration   | The amount of time it took to complete the backup. |
| Location   | The location of the backup.                        |
| Method     | The method by which the backup was taken.          |

2.  Choose a backup to restore from.
3.  Choose a cluster type to restore to.
4.  [Optional] Select **Restore Cluster** for a full restore without changing any configuration.
5.  In the **Cluster Settings**, provide a unique name for the restored cluster.
6.  For **Restore Type**, choose **Fully Restore** or **Point In Time Restore**.  If you choose **Point In Time Restore**, use the date picker to select a point in time to restore to.
7.  For **DB Configuration**, and **Additional Settings**, select your preferred database configuration.
8.  Select **Restore Cluster** once you're ready to restore the cluster from a backup.  The restored cluster will appear in the **Clusters** list in the console.

## Restoring from the API

To restore with the API, the following are required:

-   A JSON file to specify the restore configuration.
-   A shell script that uses curl to call the JSON file.

!!! Tip

    You can obtain the file templates for point in time restores in the [EDB GitHub repository](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/PGAIHM-demos).  The templates for restores are named `pitr_`.

Use the following steps to restore to a point in time using the API.

1.  In your JSON file, supply the following parameters:

**`projectID`**:   Obtain the `projectID` from the URL of your cluster.  For example, if the URL is <https://portal/projects/prj_6EOsaHpfS8RLshWH/clusters>, the `projectID` is **prj_6EOsaHpfS8RLshWH**.

**`source_cluster_id`**:  Obtain the `source_cluster_id` from the URL of your cluster.  For example, if the URL is <https://portal/projects/prj_6EOsaHpfS8RLshWH/clusters/p-nubw4gnbv9>, the `source_cluster_id` is **p-nubw4gnbv9**.

**`point_in_time`**:   Provide a timestamp value for the point in time that you want to restore the cluster to.

Supply additional information for the other configuration parameters as appropriate for the cluster you want to restore.  For example:
![PGAIHM Restore via API JSON file](../../operations/images/PGAIHM-restores-pitr-api-1.png)

2.  Create a shell script that will call the JSON file.  For example:
    ![PGAIHM Restore via API shell file](../../operations/images/PGAIHM-restores-pitr-api-2.png)

3.  Execute the shell script.  If the script returns a **clusterID** as output, the restored cluster will appear in the **Clusters** list in the console.  For example:

![PGAIHM Restore via API shell file conf](../../operations/images/PGAIHM-restores-pitr-api-3.png)

## Restoring from the CLI

Use the following steps to restore to a point in time using the CLI.

To restore with the CLI, the following are required:

-   A YAML file to specify the restore configuration.
-   Use of `edbctl` at the CLI to call the YAML file.

1.  In your YAML file, supply the following parameters:

![PGAIHM Restore via CLI YAML file](../../operations/images/PGAIHM-restores-pitr-cli-1.png)

!!! note

    For more information on the expected parameters when using the restore command, use `edbctl cluster restore -h` in the CLI to view the help file.

1.  Execute the CLI command by pointing it to your YAML file.  A message will be returned to indicate the cluster restore has started. For example:

![PGAIHM Restore via CLI YAML file](../../operations/images/PGAIHM-restores-pitr-cli-2.png)
