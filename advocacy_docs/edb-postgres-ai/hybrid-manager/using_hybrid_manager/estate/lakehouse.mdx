title: Lakehouse

---

This view is functionally equivalent to the clusters table in the [Postgres view](postgres.mdx). You can view your Lakehouse clusters, and you can apply filters to narrow your results.

Select **Lakehouse** to open the **Lakehouse** tab of the full estate view. From the **Lakehouse** tab, you can see the number of Lakehouse clusters you have access to and the metadata and metrics for the cluster.

To add a Lakehouse cluster to your estate, from the **Quick Actions** menu, hover over **Add New Lakehouse Cluster** and select a project to associate with the new cluster. The **Create Analytics Cluster** page opens, which offers two ways to add a cluster: build from a template or create a custom build:

-   To build from a template, if no templates are available, select **Create New Template** to create one. To use an existing template, select **Use Template**.
-   To create a custom build, select **Start from Scratch**.

The template creation workflow and custom build workflow for analytic clusters are the same as the regular cluster creation workflow.

To learn more about how to use the Analytics/Lakehouse feature of EDB Postgres AI HCP, see the Analytics/Lakehouse [guide](../../../analytics).
