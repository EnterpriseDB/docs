title: HashiCorp Vault

---

Before you can create TDE-enabled clusters with a HashiCorp Vault key, an administrator must install and configure Vault for the Hybrid Manager instance.

This example installs a customized version of Vault on the same Kubernetes environment as the Hybrid Manager, configures the Vault provider, and then uses the key to enable TDE for provisioning a new database cluster with encryption enabled.

If you're aiming for a vendor-neutral key management solution, it can be practical to use HashiCorp Vault, as it provides consistent, centralized key management across diverse cloud providers and on-premises environments, preventing vendor lock-in.

## Installing Vault

[Install HashiCorp Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/kubernetes/kubernetes-raft-deployment-guide) on the same Kubernetes environment where you have deployed the Hybrid Manager. Ensure you install it on its own `vault` namespace.

1.  Set up the Helm repository: 

    ```shell
    helm repo add hashicorp https://helm.releases.hashicorp.com
    ```

2.  Create a customization override for the installation to ensure Vault is installed on the Hybrid Manager's control plane, port 8200: 

    ```yaml
    cat > helm-vault-raft-values.yml <<EOF
    injector:
     tolerations: |
       - key: "edbaiplatform.io/control-plane"
         effect: 'NoSchedule'
         operator: Equal
         value: "true"


     affinity: |
       nodeAffinity:
         preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
         - preference:
             matchExpressions:
             - key: 'edbaiplatform.io/control-plane'
               operator: Exists
           weight: 1
    server:
     tolerations: |
       - key: "edbaiplatform.io/control-plane"
         effect: 'NoSchedule'
         operator: Equal
         value: "true"


     affinity: |
       nodeAffinity:
         preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
         - preference:
             matchExpressions:
             - key: 'edbaiplatform.io/control-plane'
               operator: Exists
           weight: 1
     ha:
         enabled: true
         raft:
            enabled: true
            setNodeId: true
            config: |
               cluster_name = "vault-integrated-storage"
               storage "raft" {
                  path    = "/vault/data/"
               }


               listener "tcp" {
                  address = "[::]:8200"
                  cluster_address = "[::]:8201"
                  tls_disable = "true"
               }
               service_registration "kubernetes" {}
    EOF
    ```

3.  Install Vault using the override: 

    ```shell
    helm install -n vault vault hashicorp/vault --values helm-vault-raft-values.yml  --create-namespace
    ```

4.  Wait until all pods reach the "Healthy" status before proceeding: 

    ```shell
    kubectl -n vault get pods
    ```

Now you have to initialize your Vault instance using your base64-encoded public PGP key or Keybase username and unseal it with the master key. See Vault's documentation to [Initialize and unseal Vault](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/kubernetes/kubernetes-raft-deployment-guide#initialize-and-unseal-vault).

## Configuring Vault and creating a key

Enable communication between the Vault service and the Hybrid Manager: 

1.  Access the pod where Vault is installed: 

    ```shell
    kubectl -n vault exec --stdin=true --tty=true vault-0 -- /bin/sh
    ```

2.  Enable Kubernetes communication for the vault instance: 

    ```shell
    vault auth enable kubernetes
    ```

3.  Update Vault to authenticate with the Kubernetes cluster and allow the Hybrid Manager to use Vault: 

    ```shell
    vault write auth/kubernetes/config \
      token_reviewer_jwt="$(cat /var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token)" \
      kubernetes_host=https://${KUBERNETES_PORT_443_TCP_ADDR}:443 \
      kubernetes_ca_cert=@/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/ca.crt
    ```

4.  Enable the *Transit* secrets engine to activate key management capabilities:

    ```shell
    vault secrets enable transit
    ```

5.  Create a new file that contains the Vault policy definition for the keys: 

    In this example the file with the policy is called `tde.txt`.

    ```shell
    cat > /tmp/tde.txt << EOL
    path "transit/*" {
      capabilities = ["create", "read", "update", "patch", "delete", "list"]
    }
    EOL
    ```

6.  Use the created file to update HashiCorp Vault's security policy: 

    ```shell
    vault policy write tde /tmp/tde.txt
    ```

7.  Review the default parameter values for the Transit engine (e.g. around key rotation, encryption method, etc.) and [adjust according to your requirements](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/secret/transit#parameters). Alternatively, can use the [vault write](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs/commands/write) command during key creation in the following step to override the default values for a specific key.

8.  Create a new key that uses the transit engine: 

    Replace `<my-tde-key>` with a key name of your choice.

    ```shell
    vault write -f transit/keys/<my-tde-key>
    ```

9.  Create a role called `tde` that maps Vault policies to Kubernetes service accounts: 

    ```shell
    vault write auth/kubernetes/role/tde \
      bound_service_account_names="p-*" \
      bound_service_account_namespaces="p-*" \
      policies=tde \
      ttl=72h
    ```

    !!!note

        You can configure a different `ttl` value to specify how often an application will have to re-authenticate. See Vault's documentation on [token metadata](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/tutorials/get-started/introduction-tokens#token-metadata) for more information.

10. Exit the pod: 

    ```shell
    exit 
    ```

Now that you have configured Vault and created a key, add it to a project in the PG AI Console.

## Assigning the Vault key to a project

Add the created key to a project in the PG AI Hybrid Manager using the PG AI Console:

1.  On the Console, go to the project under which you'll create TDE-enabled clusters. 
    You can use a key for several clusters in a project, but we recommend setting up a new key per additional Hybrid Manager project. 

2.  On the left-side navigation, select **Settings** â–º **Security**, and then **+ Add a key**. 

3.  Select a location to configure the key.

4.  Select **HashiCorp Vault** under **Select key management system provider**.

5.  In **Vault Address**, enter the HashiCorp Vault server endpoint.

    If Vault was installed in the `vault` namespace, and in the same Kubernetes environment as the Hybrid Manager, the default Kubernetes endpoint for Vault will be `http://vault.vault.svc.cluster.local:8200/`. If your setup is different, infer the endpoint from your environment like this: `<pod_name>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.<host>:<port_configured_for_vault>`. 

6.  In **Vault Role**, enter the name of the role you you created earlier, namely `tde`. 

7.  In **Vault Key**, enter the name of the key you created earlier (`<my-tde-key>`).

8.  If desired, you can enter an alternative key name that is easy to remember in **(Optional) Enter a friendly name for your key**.

9.  Select **Add Key**.

You can now use this key if you want to enable encryption when you create clusters. The added key will appear as an option when you [enable TDE during cluster creation](../cluster_management/create-clusters/additional-settings/#security).
