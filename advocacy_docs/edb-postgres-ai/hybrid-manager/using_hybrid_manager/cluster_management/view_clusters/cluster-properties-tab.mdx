description: Learn how to view cluster properties like configuration settings and resource allocations for a PG AI Hybrid Manager cluster.
---

The **Properties** tab provides a comprehensive overview of the configuration settings and resource allocations for the selected PostgreSQL cluster. This tab is essential for users who need to review the technical specifications or validate setup parameters before performing cluster operations such as scaling, editing, or troubleshooting.

## Purpose

This tab serves as a single point of reference for all static properties related to a cluster, including compute resources, storage configuration, network access, and PostgreSQL version. It helps database administrators, support engineers, and developers:

- Understand the cluster’s capacity and limitations
- Verify that the environment meets workload requirements
- Facilitate compliance and audit checks
- Identify configuration mismatches or deployment errors

The properties tab provides detailed information about cluster configuration settings with the following properties:

| Property                | Description                                                                     |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cluster Type          | Indicates whether the cluster is single-node or high-availability (HA).         |
| Instances             | Number of PostgreSQL instances deployed in the cluster.                         |
| PgType                | Specifies the database type (e.g., PostgreSQL).                                 |
| PostgreSQL Version    | Version of PostgreSQL currently installed in the cluster.                       |
| Image                 | The container or VM image tag used for provisioning the cluster.                |
| CPU Cores             | Total number of virtual CPU cores allocated to the cluster.                     |
| Memory                | Total memory assigned to the cluster.                                           |
| Primary Storage Class | The underlying storage class used by the persistent volume claim (e.g., `gp3`). |
| Primary Storage Size  | Size of the storage volume attached to the primary instance.                    |
| Network Access        | Indicates whether the cluster is accessible publicly or privately.              |
| Connections           | Describes the connection mode (e.g., `Read/write`).                             |
| Retention Period      | Duration for which backups and logs are retained (e.g., 30 days).               |

### Additional features

- **Edit Cluster**: Clicking the “Edit Cluster” link allows users to modify editable cluster properties such as resource allocation or network configuration. Some properties may require a restart or re-provisioning of the cluster.
- **Quick Actions**: Access context-aware options relevant to the cluster, such as scaling or deletion.
