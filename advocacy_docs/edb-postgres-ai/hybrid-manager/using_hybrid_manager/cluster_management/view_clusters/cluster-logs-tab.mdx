The Logs tab for a selected cluster in the Hybrid Manager provides real-time and historical insights into the clusterâ€™s internal operations, system events, and extension-level activities. It is a critical tool for debugging, diagnostics, and monitoring the health of individual pods in the cluster.

## Purpose

Logs tab serves as a centralized logging interface that enables users to trace events, warnings, and system activity for each pod within a cluster. It helps database administrators and Kubernetes operators quickly identify operational issues, such as misconfigured extensions, heartbeat failures, or missing components.

## Key features

- **View Pod-Level Logs**
  
  Displays logs per pod, making it easy to isolate issues affecting specific parts of the cluster.

- **Filter by Time Range**

  Use the date selector to filter logs within a specific time frame, improving focus during incident investigation.

- **Search & Filter Events**
  
  Easily locate relevant log entries by filtering on event type or keyword.

- **Log Level Indicators**

  Quickly assess the severity of each event through labels like Info or Warn.

- **Detailed Error Descriptions**

  Logs include detailed error messages such as missing extensions or failed queries, which help in root cause analysis.

The logs tab displays a detailed information of the logs with the following cloumns:

| Column    | Description                                                                                                                                                   |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Timestamp | Indicates when the log event occurred (UTC).                                                                                                                  |
| Pod       | The pod where the event originated.                                                                                                                           |
| Event     | A brief description of the event, such as extension errors or heartbeat checks. Also provides the level of severity label like info, warn, etc. of the event. |

## Usability

- Verifying if monitoring extensions (like query_advisor, edb_stat_monitor) are active and correctly configured.

- Investigating errors related to missing or non-functional database extensions.

- Tracking regular system-level events such as pod heartbeats.

- Auditing recent changes or anomalies in cluster behavior.
