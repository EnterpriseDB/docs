Use the **Cluster Connect** tab to get the connection information for the cluster and a user with the edb_admin role to connect to the `edb_admin` database in the cluster.

If the cluster is a distributed high-availability cluster, the connection information is provided for each data group in the cluster.

## Connection information

You can see the following connection information:

-   **Read/Write URI**:
      The connection string for connecting to the cluster with read/write access. This is the same as the psql command line in the **Quick Connect** section.
-   **Dbname**:
      The name of the database to connect to. This is always `edb_admin`.
-   **Read/write Host**:
      The hostname or IP address of the cluster for read/write access.
-   **Port**:
      The port to connect to. This is always `5432`.
-   **User**:
      The user to connect as. This is always edb_admin.

You can copy each of these fields to use for starting connection attempts to the database.

## `.pgpass` blob

You can copy and paste a `.pgpass` blob into your `.pgpass` file so you can connect to the cluster without entering a password. This is useful for automating connections to the cluster, such as in scripts or applications. Replace the placeholder with the actual password. To prevent unauthorized access, ensure that you have the correct permissions set on the `.pgpass` file. Set the permissions to `0600` (read and write for the user only). 

For more information about the `.pgpass` file, see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html).

## `.pg_service.conf` blob

You can copy and paste a `.pg_service.conf` blob into your `.pg_service.conf` file so you can connect to the cluster by referring to it by a *service name*. Doing so makes it easier to remember connections to the cluster. In combination with the `.pgpass` blob, you can connect by specifying the service name. For more information about the `.pg_service.conf` file, see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgservice.html).

The `pgpass` and `.pg_service.conf` files are supported by any Postgres client application that uses libpq.
