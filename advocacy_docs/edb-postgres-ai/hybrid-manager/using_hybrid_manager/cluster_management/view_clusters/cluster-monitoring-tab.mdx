The **Monitoring** tab provides a detailed view of node and cluster health.

## Monitoring

Review the **Monitoring** section for a summary of the cluster's health status. Use the monitoring control at the top of the table to control what the table shows.

You can specify when you want the displayed data to start. The default is 15 minutes, which means to display data from the last 15 minutes. You can specify a value between 15 days and 5 minutes. Alternatively, use the date and time pickers to select a custom time range to sample the monitoring data from. You can select time ranges only where data for the cluster is available. Select a time from the first menu clears any date and time you specified.

You can also specify whether to display the data as an aggregate of all the nodes in the cluster (**Cluster level**) or for each node (**Node level**). The default is to show the data at the cluster level.

At the cluster level, each ring chart is a single ring showing the average of the data for all nodes in the cluster and graphs are based on a similar aggregation.

At the node level, each chart is a concentric ring chart. Each ring represents a node in the cluster. Graphs are displayed separately for each node.

## Active alerts

The summary of active alerts displays the number of active alerts in three categories: high severity, medium severity, and low severity.

In the searchable table view of alerts, the search/filter bar lets you:

-   Filter by a text search term. Enter a value in the **Search** box.
-   Filter by a time range. Select the **From** and **To** date/time pickers.
-   Filter by severity. Select **Filter > Severity** and then one or more of the available severities.
-   Sort by start time, severity, or alert in ascending or descending order.
-   Select auto-refreshing by selecting the lightning icon.
-   Select the displayed columns. Select the cog and then, from the menu, select the columns to display in the table.
-   Download the currently displayed alerts in CSV format. Select the download icon.

## Host

- **Tuples Out** &mdash; Total number of tuples fetched and returned per second for Postgres nodes.
- **Transaction Rate** &mdash; Total number of committed/rolled-back/total transactions per second for Postgres nodes
- **Buffer Cache Hit Ratio** &mdash; Average buffer cache hit percentage across all Postgres nodes in the cluster.
- **Longest Running Transaction** &mdash; Total number of longest running transactions per second for Postgres nodes.

## Queries

- **Query Rate** &mdash; Total number of queries per second for Postgres nodes.
- **Query Latency** &mdash; Average query latency in milliseconds across all Postgres nodes in the cluster.
  
## Storage

- **Autovacuum Stats** &mdash; Total number of autovacuum operations per second for Postgres nodes.
- **Time Since Last Checkpoint** &mdash; Time since the last checkpoint in seconds for Postgres nodes.
- **Checkpoint Stats** &mdash; Total number of checkpoints per second for Postgres nodes.
- **Time Since Last Successful WAL Archive** &mdash; Time since the last successful WAL archive in seconds for Postgres nodes.
