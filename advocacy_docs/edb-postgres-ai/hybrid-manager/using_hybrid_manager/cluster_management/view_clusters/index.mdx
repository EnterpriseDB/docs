The Cluster view provides a detailed overview of the cluster, including its configuration, health, monitoring, query diagnostics, backups, logs, and other properties. To open the Cluster view, select a cluster from the Clusters table.

The Cluster view displays the name of the cluster, the creation time, the type of cluster, the Postgres distribution used, and the version of the Postgres distribution. (The creation time shows when the cluster was created relative to the current time.) Select the cluster name to open the cluster's connection information page. 

Tags are used to group clusters for easier management. On the Cluster view, the tags appear as a list of links. Select a tag to open a detailed view that shows all the resources that have that tag. 

To add or remove tags, select **+**. In the dialog box, you can add and create tags and remove tags from the cluster.

The tabs in the cluster view are:

-   [Overview](cluster-overview-tab.mdx) — A brief overview of the cluster.
-   [Connect](cluster-connect-tab.mdx) — Connection information for the cluster.
-   [Monitoring](cluster-monitoring-tab.mdx) — Monitoring information for the cluster.
-   [Query Diagnostics](cluster-query-diagnostics-tab.mdx) — Query diagnostics information for the cluster.
-   [Backups](cluster-backups-tab.mdx) — Backup information for the cluster.
-   [Logs](cluster-logs-tab.mdx) — Logs for the cluster.
-   [Properties](cluster-properties-tab.mdx) — Properties of the cluster.
