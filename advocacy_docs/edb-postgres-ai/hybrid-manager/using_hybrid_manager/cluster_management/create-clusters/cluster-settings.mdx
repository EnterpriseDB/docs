title: Cluster setup

---

Configure cluster settings like name and password in the **Cluster Settings** tab.

**Cluster Name** — Enter the name for your cluster.

**Password** — Enter a password for your cluster. This is the password for the user edb_admin. This password is needed to connect to the database and isn't stored on HCP.

**Tags** — Optionally, select **+ Add Tag** to add tags to your cluster. Tags are key-value pairs that help you organize your resources. 

-   To assign an existing tag, in the search bar under **Tags**, start to type the tag name until the tag you want to assign appears. Select the tag you want to assign to the cluster.

-   To add a new tag, enter the full tag name and select **+ Add `<tagname>`**. Then select a color for the tag and select **Create**. The new tag is assigned to the cluster.

## Settings for single-node and high-availability clusters

The following options appear on this tab only for single-node and high-availability clusters.
You set these options in the [Data Groups](data-groups.mdx) tab for other cluster types. (If you're creating a distributed high-availability or advanced high-availability cluster, select **Next: Data Groups** to move to that tab.)

**Deployment Location** — Select the location for the cluster to be deployed into. The default location is in the Kubernetes cluster hosting the EDB Postgres AI service. Where HCP has been configured in a multi-HCP environment, you can select the location for the cluster to be deployed into.

**Database Type** — Select the type of Postgres you want to use:

1.  In the **Postgres Type** field, select the type of Postgres you want to use:

    -   **[EDB Postgres Advanced Server]\(**TODO**)** is EDB's Oracle-compatible database offering. View [a quick demonstration of Oracle compatibility on EDB Postgres AI](**TODO**). EDB Postgres Advanced Server is compatible with all three cluster types.

    -   **[EDB Postgres Extended Server]\(**TODO**)** is EDB's PostgreSQL-compatible database offering that uses advanced logical replication.

    -   **[PostgreSQL]\(**TODO**)** is the open-source, object-relational database management system. PostgreSQL is compatible with single-node and high-availability cluster types.

2.  In the **Postgres Version** list, select the version of Postgres that you want to use.

3.  HCP supports multiple images of each Postgres database, stored in the image library. Each image is a configuration of the database that includes various extensions. Select the image that you want to use for your cluster. See [Asset library](/guide/image-management/image-library.mdx) for more information. Generally, with no `-full` at the end of the name, the image has no extensions. With \`-full" at the end of the name, the image has all available extensions.

**Instance Size** — Select the number of CPUs and the amount of memory for your cluster. The number of CPUs and the amount of memory you can select depends on available resources in your Kubernetes cluster.

### Storage

You can specify the following storage settings:

**Use a separate storage volume for Write-Ahead Logs** — By default, HCP uses a separate storage volume for database storage and write-ahead logs (WAL) files. This default gives best performance and reliability. Clear the check box to store WAL files on the same volume as the database storage.

By default, HCP uses a separate storage volume for database storage and Write-Ahead Logs (WAL) files. This default gives best performance and resilience. If you deselect it, WAL files will be stored on the same volume as the database storage.

**Database Storage** — Under **Database Storage** you can select the database storage class (gp2 or gp3) and size of the database storage volume in GiB (default is 1).

**Write-Ahead Logs Storage** — Under **Write-Ahead Logs Storage**, you can select the WAL storage class (gp2 or gp3) and size of the WAL storage volume in GiB (default is 1).

### Networking

For **Connectivity Type**, select whether to use private networking (the default) or public networking.

-   **Private** networking allows only IP addresses in your private network to connect to your cluster. 

-   **Public** networking means that any client can connect to your cluster’s public IP address over the internet.
