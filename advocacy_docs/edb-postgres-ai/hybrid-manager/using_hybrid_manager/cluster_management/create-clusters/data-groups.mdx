description: Learn about creating data groups when creating a PG AI Hybrid Manager cluster.
---

The **Data Groups** tab is available when you create or edit a distributed high-availability or advanced high availability cluster. Use it to create and manage *data groups* for advanced and distributed high-availability clusters. A data group is typically a regionally close group of data nodes that are configured to replicate data within the group and respond to application queries. A distributed high-availability cluster can be made of one or more data groups that also replicate to each other, enabling geodistributed clusters.

## Creating data groups

1.  With **Advanced High Availability** or **Distributed High Availability** selected on the **Cluster Info** tab, select the **Data Groups** tab.

2.  Select the [**Node Settings**](data-groups.mdx#node-settings) tab and fill out the required information.

3.  Select the [**DB Configuration**](data-groups.mdx#database-parameter-configuration) tab and modify parameters as needed. 

4.  Select **Create Data Group**.

    The new data group is listed in the **Data Groups** tab. Expand the cluster architecture diagram to see a summary of the data group. 

To add another data group, select **Add Data Group**.

!!! Note

    If you create two data groups, a witness group is automatically added. You can edit the witness group as you can the data groups, though the options are more limited. You can set the name of the group, deployment location, database type, version, image and instance size.

## Node settings

Use the **Node Settings** tab to set up the data group.

**Nodes** — Select a configuration of nodes in the group.

You can select the recommended three-data-node configuration or a two-data-node configuration. For advanced high-availability clusters, you can create a one-node configuration. For more information on the node architectures see, [Distribution high availability](../../../overview/database_types/distributed_highavailability.mdx).

**Deployment Location** — Select the location for the cluster to be deployed into. The default location is in the Kubernetes cluster hosting the EDB Postgres AI service. Where Hybrid Manager (HM) has been configured in a multi-HM environment, you can select the location for the cluster to be deployed into.

**Database Type** — Select the type of Postgres you want to use:

1.  In the **Postgres Type** field, select the type of Postgres you want to use:

    -   EDB Postgres Advanced Server is EDB's Oracle-compatible database offering. EDB Postgres Advanced Server is compatible with all the cluster types.

    -   EDB Postgres Extended Server is EDB's PostgreSQL-compatible database offering that uses advanced logical replication.

    -   PostgreSQL is the open-source, object-relational database management system. PostgreSQL is compatible with single-node and high-availability cluster types.

2.  In the **Postgres Version** list, select the version of Postgres that you want to use.

3.  HM supports multiple images of each Postgres database, stored in the image library. Each image is a configuration of the database that includes various extensions. Select the image that you want to use for your cluster. See [Asset library](../../image-management/asset-library.mdx) for more information. Generally, images without `-full` at the end of the name have no extensions. With `-full` at the end of the name, the image has all available extensions except PostGIS.

**Instance Size** — Select the number of CPUs and the amount of memory for your cluster. The number of CPUs and the amount of memory you can select depends on available resources in your Kubernetes cluster.

### Storage

You can specify the following storage settings:

**Use a separate storage volume for Write-Ahead Logs** — By default, HM uses a separate storage volume for database storage and write-ahead log (WAL) files. This default gives best performance and reliability. Clear the check box to store WAL files on the same volume as the database storage.

**Database Storage** — Under **Database Storage** you can select the database storage class (gp2 or gp3) and size of the database storage volume in GiB (default is 1).

**Write-Ahead Logs Storage** — Under **Write-Ahead Logs Storage**, you can select the WAL storage class (gp2 or gp3) and size of the WAL storage volume in GiB (default is 1).

### Networking

For **Connectivity Type**, select whether to use private networking (the default) or public networking.

-   **Private** networking allows only IP addresses in your private network to connect to your cluster. 

-   **Public** networking means that any client can connect to your cluster’s public IP address over the internet.

### Backups

Change the default database backup retention period of 30 days using the
**Retention Period** controls in the **Backups** section. You can configure the
retention period in days, weeks, or months. Set a retention period
between 1 and 180 days, 1 and 25 weeks, or 1 and 6 months.

### Security

This section appears after you select **EDB Postgres Advanced Server** or **EDB Postgres Extended Server** as the database type and select the version and image. Changes here are applied to all data groups.

Enable **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)** to use your own encryption key. This option is available for EDB Postgres Advanced Server and EDB Postgres Extended Server for version 15 and later.

Enable **TDE** by selecting the **Enable TDE** check box.

To learn more about TDE support, see [Transparent Data Encryption](https://enterprisedb.com/docs/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/security/security/#your-own-encryption-key---transparent-data-encryption-tde).

## Database parameter configuration

Select the **DB Configuration tab** to configure the parameters for the database.

In the **Parameters** section, you can update the value of the database configuration parameters as needed.

The database parameters listed on the **DB Configuration** tab are also referred to as Grand Unified Configuration (GUC) variables. See [What Is a GUC Variable?](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/what-guc-variable) for more information.

The list of parameters is populated based on the type of database you selected on the **Cluster Settings** tab when you created your cluster. For more information about the parameters for your database type:

-   For PostgreSQL parameters, see [Setting Parameters](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/config-setting.html) and [Server Configuration](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config.html) in the Postgres documentation.

-   For EDB Postgres Advanced Server, see [Summary of configuration parameters](https://enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/reference/database_administrator_reference/02_summary_of_configuration_parameters/) and [Configuration parameters](https://enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/database_administration/01_configuration_parameters/).

-   For more information on the types of values the parameters accept, see [Parameter Names and Values](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/config-setting.html#CONFIG-SETTING-NAMES-VALUES). The types apply to both PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server parameters.

!!! note

    You can make changes to database or server parameters after cluster creation is complete. Changing some parameters requires a restart.

### Modifying a parameter

1.  Find the parameter you want to modify using these methods:
    -   Search for a specific parameter using the search field. 
    -   Filter the parameters that are listed by select8hg an option in the **Show only** list:
        -   **Custom Values** — Shows only parameters that changed from the default values, either in the current session or modified in a previous session and applied to the cluster.
        -   **Currently Edited Values** — Shows only parameters that changed during the current editing session.

2.  Enter the new value in the parameter value field. Your entry can be a literal value or a [formula](../manage-clusters/formula.mdx) that calculates the value based on other parameters.

    !!! Warning

        Parameters identified with a yellow exclamation point icon trigger a restart when you save your changes. The restart terminates all open connections and takes a few minutes to complete. It takes a few more seconds for the new connection to establish. During this process, you can't connect to the database.

## Managing data groups

You can duplicate, edit, and delete data groups:

-   To duplicate a group, select **Duplicate**. Then edit the new group to differentiate it from the original.

-   Select **Edit** to make adjustments to the data group.

-   Select **Delete** to delete a data group. You're prompted to confirm the deletion.

-   To add a data group, select **Add Data Group**.
