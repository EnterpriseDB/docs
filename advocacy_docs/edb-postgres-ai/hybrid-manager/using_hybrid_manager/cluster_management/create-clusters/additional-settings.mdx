title: Backup and security settings

---

On the **Additional Settings** tab, you can specify the backup retention period and some security features.

## Backups

Change the default database backup retention period of 30 days using the
**Retention Period** controls in the **Backups** section. You can configure the
retention period in days, weeks, or months. Set a retention period
between 1 and 180 days, 1 and 25 weeks, or 1 and 6 months.

## Security

You can [encrypt your cluster's data](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/tde/latest/about/what/), if required.

This option is available for EDB Postgres Advanced Server and EDB Postgres Extended Server for versions 15 and later.

Use the **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)** toggle to enable TDE. 

!!!Note

    You can't enable, disable, or modify the TDE configuration after the cluster is created.
    

You can set the following options:

-   **Enter a Passphrase**. This [secures the data encryption key created by the Hybrid Manager](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/tde/latest/secure_key/#choosing-a-mechanism-to-protect-the-data-encryption-key) with a passphrase when you create a TDE-enabled cluster.

-   If the administrator of your Hybrid Manager instance previously [enabled a key from a key management system](../../kms_for_tde/adding_kms_support.mdx), you can also select **Customer Key Management**. Then select one of the configured keys to secure the data encryption key created by the Hybrid Manager.
