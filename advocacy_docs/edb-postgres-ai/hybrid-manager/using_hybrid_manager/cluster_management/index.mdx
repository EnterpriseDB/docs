You can use Hybrid Manager (HM) to create and manage database clusters. The databases can be based on any of the following Postgres types:

- EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS)

- EDB Postgres Extended Server (PGE)

- PostgreSQL

Cluster management includes creating new clusters, controlling access, monitoring cluster performance, and managing lifecycle operations such as editing, restoring, or deleting clusters. You can also create reusable templates to simplify future cluster creation.

## What can you do?

- [Creating a cluster](./create-clusters/)

  Learn how to create a new database cluster from a predefined template or configure one from scratch.

- [Managing a Cluster](./manage-clusters/)

  Perform key management tasks such as modifying configuration, restoring backups, deleting clusters, and creating templates.

- [Managing Database Access](./managing_db_access/)

  Set up users, roles, and permissions to control who can access and connect to your clusters.

- [Viewing Clusters](./view_clusters/)

  Monitor and review the status, configuration, and activity of all your database clusters.
