You can use HM to create database clusters. The database can use any of these Postgres types: EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Extended Server, or PostgreSQL.

To learn about creating clusters, see [Creating a database cluster](create-clusters).

Either as part of cluster creation or after your cluster is creating, you might need to perform some related tasks. For example, you might need to manage your clusters (editing, restoring, and deleting) or understand how they're performing. You might also want to create a template to use as the basis for future clusters you create. 

To learn about these cluster management tasks, see [Managing clusters](manage-clusters).
