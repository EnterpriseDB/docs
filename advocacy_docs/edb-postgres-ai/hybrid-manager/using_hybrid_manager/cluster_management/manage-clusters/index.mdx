Several management tasks are associated with clusters in the Hybrid Manager.

## Cluster creation tasks

As part of the cluster creation process, you might want to:

-   [Create a cluster template](create-cluster-template.mdx) that you can use as the basis for new templates.
-   [Create a formula](formula.mdx) to use as a value for certain configuration parameters.

## Working with existing clusters

After you [create a cluster](../create-clusters), you can use the three-dot menu to the right of the cluster name to:

-   [Edit the cluster](edit-clusters.mdx) to make changes to most of its configuration.
-   Change a cluster password.
-   [Delete a cluster](delete-clusters.mdx).
-   Upgrade a cluster. You can perform a minor upgrade or a major upgrade.
-   [Restore a deleted cluster](restore-clusters.mdx).

The menu includes only the options the available to the current project user.

## Analyze how your Postgres cluster's running

While your cluster is running, you may need to look at the status of the Kubernetes infrastructure your Postgres clusters are running on. You can do this by [tracing the cluster back to its Kubernetes resources](trace-clusters.mdx). For example, you can use Grafana to better understand how resources are being used.
