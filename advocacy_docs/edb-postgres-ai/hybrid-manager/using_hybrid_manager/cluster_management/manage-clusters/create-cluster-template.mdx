You can create a cluster template to use as the basis for future clusters. Creating a template is similar to creating a cluster. You need to specify all the same information.

## Starting point

The starting point is the landing page of the project you want to create the template in. To get there, from the **Projects** page, select the project.

In the project page, in the left navigation, select **Clusters > Cluster Templates**.

The **Cluster Templates** page lists any templates in the project, including Lakehouse Analytics templates.

Select **Create Template > Create Database Cluster Template**.

From this point, specifying the cluster configuration is the same as it is for creating a cluster. You can step through the tabs in order using **Next**, or you can select the tab you want to work on. For details see:

-   [Cluster types to create](../create-clusters/cluster-info.mdx)
-   [Cluster setup](../create-clusters/cluster-settings.mdx)
-   [Database configuration parameters](../create-clusters/db-configuration.mdx)
-   [Backup and security settings](../create-clusters/additional-settings.mdx) 
-   [Creating data groups](../create-clusters/data-groups.mdx) (for advanced or distributed high-availability clusters)

When you've finished configuring your cluster template, select **Create Template**.

The new template is added to the list of templates.

## Deleting templates

You can delete a template from the **Cluster Templates** page if you no longer need it.

!!! Warning
    You can't recover or restore a deleted template.

1.  On the page for the project whose template you want to delete, in the left navigation, select **Clusters > Cluster Templates**.
2.  Next to the template you want to delete, select the **Delete** icon.
3.  Type `delete template` in the confirmation box and select **Delete**.

For information on using the template, see [Creating a cluster from a template](../create-clusters/create-clusters-with-templates.mdx)
