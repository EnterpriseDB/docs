You can start editing the cluster from the **Postgres Clusters** page or from the detailed view of the cluster:

-   On the **Postgres Clusters** page, next to the cluster you want to edit, select **Edit**.

-   To get to the detailed view of the cluster, on the **Postgres Clusters** page, select the cluster name. On the **Cluster Details** page, select **Quick Actions > Edit Cluster**.

!!! note
    You can make changes to database or server parameters after cluster creation is complete. Changing some parameters requires a restart.

## Editing a cluster

The **Edit Cluster** page is similar to the **Create Cluster** page. Select the tab you want to work on, or step through the tabs in order using **Next**:

-   [**Cluster Info**](../create-clusters/cluster-info.mdx)
-   [**Cluster Settings**](../create-clusters/cluster-settings.mdx)
-   [**DB Configuration**](../create-clusters/db-configuration.mdx) (optional)
-   [**Additional Settings**](../create-clusters/additional-settings.mdx) (optional)  
-   [**Data Groups**](../create-clusters/data-groups.mdx) (for distributed high-availability clusters)

!!! Note
    When editing a cluster, you can't switch between a single-node or high-availability cluster and an advanced or distributed high-availability cluster

## Saving and confirming edits

When you have completed your changes to the cluster configuration, select **Save**.

If the configuration is valid, a list of the changes to be made to the cluster appears. A warning might also appear saying the changes may trigger a server restart. Select **Confirm Changes** to apply the changes to the cluster and return to the page you started from.

!!! Note
    Selecting the **Back** arrow at the top of the page abandons your changes and returns to the page you started from.
