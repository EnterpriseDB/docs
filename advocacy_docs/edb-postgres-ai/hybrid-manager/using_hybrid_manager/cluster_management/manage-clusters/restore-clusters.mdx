You can restore a deleted cluster from a backup. The backup must be in the same project as the cluster you're restoring. The restore process technically creates a new cluster with the same configuration as the deleted cluster. Because it's actually a new cluster, you need to give it a new name and a new password.

The restored cluster is created in the same project as the deleted cluster. You can restore a deleted cluster for as long as the backup is available. The backup remains available for the retention period set for each cluster. After the retention period passes, the backup is deleted.

## Restoring a cluster from a backup

1.  Select **Clusters > Postgres Clusters**.

2.  Select the **Deleted** tab.

3.  Next to the deleted cluster you want to restore, select the **Restore** icon. 

4.  In the **Restore Cluster** dialog box, select the backup you want to restore and select **Restore**.

    The **Restore Cluster** page opens. This page is similar to the **Create Cluster** page. It displays the cluster name, cluster type, and the backup you selected to restore. You can change the cluster name and cluster type if you want.

5.  Enter a new password.

6.  On the **Cluster Settings** tab, you can optionally change cluster settings. Under **Restore Type** select the type of restore you want to perform:

    -   **Fully Restore** — Restore the entire cluster from the last full backup of the database. After you select this option, you can select the backup you want to restore from the list below it.

    -   **Point In Time Restore** — Restore the cluster to a specific point in time. Select a date and time within the retention period of the backup. The range appears under the date and time picker.

7.  Use the other tabs as needed. For details, see [Cluster creation settings](../create-clusters/cluster-settings.mdx)

8.  Select **Restore Cluster**. 

    The **Postgres Clusters** page opens, and you can see the progress of the restore operation. The restored cluster will be in the same project as the original cluster. It has the same configuration as that cluster but a new name and password.
