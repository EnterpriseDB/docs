Several management tasks are associated with clusters in HCP.

## Cluster creation tasks

As part of the cluster creation process, you might want to:

-   [Create a cluster template](create-cluster-template.mdx) that you can use as the basis for new templates.
-   [Create a formula](formula.mdx) to use as a value for certain configuration parameters.

## Working with existing clusters

After you [create a cluster](../create-clusters), you can:

-   [Edit the cluster](edit-clusters.mdx) to make changes to most of its configuration.
-   [Delete a cluster](delete-clusters.mdx).
-   [Restore a deleted cluster](restore-clusters.mdx).

## Analyze how your Postgres cluster's running

While your cluster is running, you may need to look at the status of the Kubernetes infrastructure your Postgres clusters are running on. You can do this by [tracing the cluster back to its Kubernetes resources](trace-clusters.mdx). For example, you can use Grafana to better understand how resources are being used.
