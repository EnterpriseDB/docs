In Hybrid Control Plane, the *estate* refers to all the resources you have access to. Any resource you add becomes part of your estate and appears on the **Estate** page.

Rather than grouping resources by project, the overview groups by types of resources. Each resource shows its type, the number of instances of that resource, and a graphical representation or breakdown of those instances, which appears on the right pane.

## Viewing your estate

The HCP console is a centralized location for viewing, monitoring, and managing the lifecycle of databases.

### Tabs

Primarily, the **Estate** page provides monitoring of your Postgres clusters, Migrations, Lakehouse deployments and more:

-   [**Postgres**](postgres.mdx)
-   [**Migrations**](migrations)
-   [**Lakehouse**](lakehouse.mdx)

The **Estate** page also has a **Quick Actions** menu you can use to perform the following actions:

-   **Create EDB Postgres AI Cluster** — Create an EDB Postgres AI cluster in an existing project.
-   **Add New Lakehouse Cluster** — Add a Lakehouse cluster to an existing project.
-   **Add Self-managed Cluster** — Add a new self-managed cluster to an existing project.
