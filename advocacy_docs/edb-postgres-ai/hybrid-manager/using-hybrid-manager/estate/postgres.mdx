title: Postgres

---

The **Postgres** view is the main estate view. It displays some summary statistics at the top of the page followed by a searchable table of all the clusters across all the projects of your account.

## Summary statistics cards

You can view the following cards:

-   The **Active Alerts** card shows the aggregated number of high-, medium-, and low-severity alerts across all of the Postgres clusters monitored in your estate.

-   The **Top CPU Usage** card shows up to the top nine clusters with the most CPU usage across all of your Postgres clusters monitored in your estate. 
    Each card page shows three clusters. Up to three pages are available.

-   The **Resource Usage** card shows the aggregated CPU, memory, and storage usage across all of your Postgres clusters monitored in your estate.

## Clusters table

The clusters table provides a list of all of the available Postgres clusters across your projects.

### Selecting columns to display

By default, the table shows these columns:

-   **Project Name** — Project that the cluster belongs to.
-   **Cluster** — Cluster name.
-   **Management** — How the cluster is managed: by appliance or self-managed.
-   **Cluster Type** — The type of cluster: PGD, single-node, or HA.
-   **Status** — Current status of the cluster: OK, Error, Caution, or Working.
-   **Engine** — Current Postgres distribution type this cluster is running: Postgres, EDB Postgres Advanced Server, or EDB Extended Server.
-   **Version** — Major version of Postgres distribution the cluster is running: 13, 14, 15, 16, or 17.
-   **Alerts** — Count of high-, medium-, and low-severity alerts for the cluster.
-   **TPS** — Transactions per second being made by the cluster and a line graph summarizing recent trends.
-   **CPU**  — Percentage of CPU currently used by the Postgres cluster in the hosting node and a line graph summarizing recent trends.
-   **Memory** — Percentage of memory currently used by the Postgres cluster in the hosting node and a line graph summarizing recent trends.
-   **Disk** — Percentage of disk space currently used by the Postgres cluster in the hosting node and a line graph summarizing recent trends.
-   **Tags** — Tags associated with the cluster.

To reset the columns to this default set, from the gear menu, select **Reset Columns**.

You can also select the columns to display. Select the gear to open a menu with a search field at the top. Use the search field to filter columns to show using text matching. See [Filtering clusters](postgres.mdx#filtering-clusters).

Each column name has a check box next to it. Columns with a selected check box are currently displayed in the table.

In addition to the columns that are displayed by default, you can select the following columns to display in the table:

-   **# of Alerts** — Total number of alerts for the cluster.
-   **# of Cores** — Total number of cores used by the cluster.
-   **Conn. Usage** — Connection usage as a percentage.
-   **IO Wait %** — Percentage of the wait events of type Input/Output.
-   **IOPS** — Number of input/output operations per second for the cluster.
-   **Kernel Version** — Platform type of a self-managed instance.
-   **Last Backup** — ISO 8601 timestamp of the last time the cluster was backed up.
-   **OS Version** — Operating system version of a self-managed instance.
-   **Provider** — ID of the CSP provider.
-   **Region** — Locationid for an appliance cluster.
-   **Rep. Lag** — Replication lag in milliseconds.
-   **TDS** — Total database size in gibibytes.

### Filtering clusters

You can filter cluster results by text using the table's search bar. For example, you can search for a cluster by name.

You can also filter show results by these cluster properties:

-   **Cluster Type**:
    -   **Distributed High Availability** — Postgres Distributed (PGD) clusters.
    -   **PSR** — Single and high-availability (HA) clusters (non-PGD).

### Filtering clusters

You can filter cluster results further by text using the table's **Search** bar. For instance, you can search for a cluster by name. 
You can also filter displayed results by various cluster properties:

-   **Cluster Type**:
    -   **Single Node or HA**: Select to show Single Node and High Availability clusters.
    -   **Advanced High Availability (AHA)**: Select to show Advanced High Availability clusters.
    -   **Distributed High Availability (PGD)**: Select to show Postgres Distributed clusters.
-   **Engine**:
    -   **EDB Postgres Advanced Server** — Clusters running EDB Postgres Advanced Server.
    -   **EDB Postgres Extended Server** — Clusters running EDB Postgres Extended Server.
    -   **PostgreSQL** — Clusters running community PostgreSQL.
-   **Include Deleted Clusters** — Clusters that were deleted.
-   **Location** — Clusters belonging to a specific location.
-   **Postgres Version** — Clusters of a specific major Postgres version.
-   **Project Name** — Clusters belonging to a specific project.
-   **Resource Type**:
    -   **Appliance** — Clusters managed by EDB Hybrid Control Plane.
    -   **Self Managed Postgres** — Clusters that are self-managed.
    -   **Self Managed Postgres Databases** — Clusters with databases that are self-managed.
-   **Status**:
    -   **OK** — Clusters that are healthy and stable.
    -   **Error** — Clusters that have an error.
    -   **Caution** — Clusters that have warnings.
    -   **Working** — Clusters that are currently doing work to get to a healthy status.

You can sort results by name, status, engine, and location.

### Monitoring data staleness

The data in the table is refreshed every 30 seconds. A message under the table shows the last time the table was updated with new data.
