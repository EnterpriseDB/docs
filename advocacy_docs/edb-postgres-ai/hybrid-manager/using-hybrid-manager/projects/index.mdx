In the overview view of projects, you can see the name of each project, an option to add tags, the number of clusters in the project, and the number of users who have access to that project.

Select **View Projects** to open the **Projects** tab for a full view.

If you have owner privileges, you can create projects. Select **Create New Project**, enter a name and, optionally, select tags for the new project. Then select **Create New Project** to create the project. 

After you create the project, the Project view opens. You're the owner of the new project, and you can start to add resources.
