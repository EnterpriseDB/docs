title: Clusters

---

Under **Clusters**, you can choose to view your Postgres clusters, model clusters, or cluster templates. 

Select **Clusters > Postgres Clusters** to list the Postgres clusters in the project. The list shows the:

-   Cluster name
-   Creation time (or, for a paused cluster, when it was paused and when it will resume)
-   Postgres version
-   Type of cluster
-   Provisioned instance type

Selecting a cluster in the table opens the detailed view of the cluster with the **Cluster overview** tab open. The Overview tab lets you select a quick-connect connection string, view active alerts on the cluster, and see a summary of recent activity on the cluster. Other tabs provide more detailed information about the cluster, including the full connection information, monitoring, query diagnostics, backups, logs, and other properties of the cluster.

Select **Create New** to create a cluster in the project. This selection opens the [Create Cluster](../../../cluster-management/create-clusters) page.

## Cluster actions

Next to the cluster information select the lock to see the credential information for the cluster. Select the pen to edit the cluster. Use the ellipsis menu to perform the following cluster management tasks.
