title: Alerts

---

You can configure alerts on database clusters using the alert controls. When a threshold you specify is breached, an alert is triggered and a [notification](notifications.mdx) is sent to the specified destinations.

The list of alerts includes:

-   A switch to enable or disable the alert.
-   The name of the alert control, which indicates what the control is monitoring. 
-   The type of alert.
-   A severity indicator that shows how the alert is classified. The severity levels are high, medium, and low. The severity level indicates the urgency of the alert when a notification is sent.
-   The **Notify After** field, which shows how long the alert condition must be met before an alert is triggered. 
-   The **Threshold** field, which shows the value that triggers the alert. 

To edit an alert, select the pen next to the alert. When you edit an alert, you can:

-   Enable or disable it.
-   Specify the **Notify After** value. This field is useful for preventing false positives from triggering alerts. Enter a number and select a time unit (seconds, minutes, or hours) to specify the time to wait before the alert is triggered.
-   Specify a threshold value. Use the slider or enter a value in the text box. The units depend on the type of alert.
