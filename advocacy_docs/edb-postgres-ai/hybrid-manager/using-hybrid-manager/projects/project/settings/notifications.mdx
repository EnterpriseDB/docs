Use the **Notifications** settings to configure whether the projectâ€™s notifications arrive by email, PagerDuty, or a webhook.

## Configuring notifications

Project owners and editors can enable or disable notifications for the events visible to them. They can receive notifications in the application's inbox, by email, or both.

Notification settings a user specifies apply only to that user. If email notification is enabled, the email is sent to the email address associated with the user's login.

The project owner can configure system notification channels at the project level. By default, each project inherits the global-level system notifications channel. However, you can enable, disable, or reconfigure the system notifications channel at the project level to override the default settings.

Read more about notifications in [Notifications](../../../monitoring/notifications.mdx).
