You can view projects in EDB Postgres AI using any of these methods.

## Projects in the single-pane-of-glass view

The single-pane view of projects shows the top three active projects in your organization. To see more projects, select **View All Projects**, which opens the [Projects tab](viewing.mdx#projects-in-the-projects-tab).

In this view, you can see the project name, the number of resources in the project, the number of users with roles in the project, and tags associated with that project, if any are set. You can also optionally add tags to a project. 

The ellipses menu next to each entry gives access to the actions available to the current user for that project.
