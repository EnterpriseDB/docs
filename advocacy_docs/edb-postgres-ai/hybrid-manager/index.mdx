The landscape of database management has grown increasingly complex as organizations move from single-server setups to distributed systems. Kubernetes has become a cornerstone for managing modern distributed applications, offering scalability, resilience, and automation for containerized workloads. However, while Kubernetes is well-suited for stateless applications, managing stateful workloads, such as databases, has required additional tools and innovations. Most notable are persistent volumes and database-specific operators like CloudNative Postgres.

Even with these advancements, *setting up and managing a complete data ecosystem remains a significant challenge*. The PG AI platform's Hybrid Manager (HM) addresses this by providing a unified interface for provisioning and managing PostgreSQL clusters, including Postgres Distributed (PGD). Built on Kubernetes, HM simplifies database operations by being flexible enough for on-premise deployments, as well as cloud environments such as AWS's EKS and Google Cloud's GKE.
