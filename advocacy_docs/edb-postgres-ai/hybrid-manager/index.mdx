**EDB Postgres AI Hybrid Manager** is the control plane of the EDB Postgres AI Platform—a **sovereign AI, analytics, and Postgres management solution** that runs anywhere you run Kubernetes. It offers a unified experience for deploying databases, running GenAI workloads, and scaling Postgres-native analytics across **cloud**, **on-prem**, or **hybrid environments**.

It works on the follow Kubernetes distributions: **Amazon EKS**, **Google GKE**, and **Red Hat OpenShift (RHOS)**.

## One platform, full control

EDB Hybrid Manager brings together the infrastructure, data, and application layers required to support modern Postgres-based data platforms:

- **Sovereign AI** — Build and serve AI-powered workloads using your own infrastructure, with full control over GPU resources and GenAI pipelines.
- **Postgres-native analytics** — Offload to open data formats like Iceberg and Delta Lake while preserving Postgres compatibility and control.
- **Operational excellence** — Simplify backup, scaling, monitoring, and cluster lifecycle management for Postgres clusters.

Whether deployed in the cloud or on-premises, Hybrid Manager ensures **observability, governance, and resilience** across your data and AI stack.

## What you can do

| Area | Capabilities |
|------|--------------|
| **Database Management** | Provision, upgrade, and operate PostgreSQL and Distributed Postgres clusters across your Kubernetes environments. |
| **AI Integration** | Serve models using NVIDIA NIM, build knowledge bases, and connect AI pipelines—all governed and observable. |
| **Analytics Tiering** | Push cold data to object storage, query via Iceberg or Delta Lake, and combine transactional and analytical use cases. |
| **Kubernetes-Native Monitoring** | Track resource usage, query diagnostics, alerts, and cluster health using built-in dashboards (Prometheus, Grafana, Loki). |
| **Security and Access** | Connect with your identity provider, enforce least-privilege roles, and manage project-level access across teams. |
