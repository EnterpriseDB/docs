navTitle: Known issues 1.2

---

These are the currently known issues in Hybrid Manager (HM) 1.2.
These known issues are tracked in HM's ticketing system and are expected to be resolved in a future release.

* When creating AHA cluster from cluster template, there’s a Cluster Architecture Diagram section in the bottom of the screen. The diagram correctly shows the 2-node and 3-node scenario, but shows empty for 1-node. Moreover, there’s no such section in the screen if you create a cluster from project quick action.

* Provisioning into RHOS with insufficient provisioned compute, but with additional compute provisioning possible, may fail due to a failure of RHOS machines to scale out.

* Node level charts can show duplicate metrics in `kube_pod_metrics` when a primary node is force deleted.

* Cluster creation UI for numeric fields allows clicking the down arrow resulting in values below zero. Please don't use these negative values.

* Istio is part of the HM deployment and the Istio version can be upgraded. In this case, existing pods with the `istio-proxy` sidecar keeps using the old `istio-proxy` version. The incompatible version issue will not cause functional problems, however Istio does not recommend doing this.

* When you delete an external cluster being observed by HM, the cluster still shows in the HM Estate for 72 hours, in case of a temporary outage, then disappears.

* 

* Asset Library may be unable to serve a list of images resulting in errors like, "No images are available in this location. Please select another location." There are two reasons for this:
    1. HM is under maintenance, meaning an upgrade is being applied whihc will temporarily affect the service, as Asset Library may be synchronizing new Postgres images.
    2. The upstream container registry may be responding slowly.

    Please wait a few minutes after the upgrade completes and revisit the Asset Library. If there are issues connecting to the registry, then resolve and retry connecting.
