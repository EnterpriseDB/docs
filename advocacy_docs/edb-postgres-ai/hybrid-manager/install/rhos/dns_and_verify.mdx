After you've completed the Helm or Operator install, update your DNS zone records and verify that Hybrid Manager is working as expected.

## Update DNS zone records

1.  Retrieve the hostname of the portal service.
    This hostname represents the ingress endpoint for your Hybrid Manager.

    ```bash
    kubectl get svc -n istio-system istio-ingressgateway -o yaml | yq '.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname'
    ```

1.  Create CNAME records in your DNS zone for the following domain names and point them to the retrieved hostname.

    -   `PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME`
    -   `TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME`
    -   `BEACON_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME`

Each CNAME record maps a user-facing domain name to the ingress hostname.

Now you can [connect to the portal](portalconnection.mdx) and verify the installation.
