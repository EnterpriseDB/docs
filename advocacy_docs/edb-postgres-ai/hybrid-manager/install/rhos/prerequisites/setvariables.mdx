The HM cluster needs access to certain user domains during the installation.

## Set domain variables

1. Set the variable that defines the default ingress domain name for the RHOS cluster:

   ```
   export DEFAULT_INGRESS_DOMAIN=<rhos default ingress domain name> # rhos default ingress domain
   ```

   !!! Important

       `DEFAULT_INGRESS_DOMAIN` is the default ingress domain name of the cluster.
       You can query it using the following command:

       ```
       oc get ingresses.config/cluster -o jsonpath={.spec.domain}
       ```

       The ingresses.config/cluster object is created during the installation.

       See [the OpenShift documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.17/html/networking/configuring-routes#nw-creating-a-route_route-configuration) for more.

1. Set the variable that defines the domain name to access the OpenShift Console:

   ```
   export OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_DOMAIN_NAME=<openshift console domain name> # Domain name to OpenShift console
   ```

1.  Define the variable for the Hybrid Manager's domain name. This domain will serve as the public URL for accessing the HM Console.

    ```bash
    export PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME=<your-hm-portal-domain-name>
    ```
    
    For example, if your company's name is **Example Company** and top level domain is `examplecompany.com`, EDB recommends your portal domain name follows a similar pattern as in these examples:

    ```bash
    portal.examplecompany.com               
    portal-dev.examplecompany.com           
    portal.hm001.examplecompany.com         
    portal-hm-us-east-001.examplecompany.com
    ```

1. Set the variable for the Data Migration Service domain name (internally called `transporter`): 

   ```bash
   export TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME=dms<your-hm-portal-domain-name> # Customer domain name for the EDB Postgres AI Platform Transporter RW Service
   ```

   EDB recommends deriving the DMS service domain name from your portal domain name, as this consistency facilitates managing your services, for example, by replacing `portal` with `dms`. Following the previous examples:

    ```bash
    dms.examplecompany.com               
    dms-dev.examplecompany.com           
    dms.hm001.examplecompany.com         
    dms-hm-us-east-001.examplecompany.com
    ```

   !!! Important
   
       `PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME` and `TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME` must be:
   
       -   distinct from each otherâ€”do not use the same name for both
       -   distinct from `OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_DOMAIN_NAME`

1. Set the variables that define the domain name for the EDB Postgres AI Beacon Service and the namespace where `cert-manager` is installed:

   ```
   export BEACON_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME=<beacon service domain name> # Customer domain name for the EDB Postgres AI Beacon Service
   export CERT_MANAGER_NAMESPACE=<cert-manager namespace> # Customer namespace in which cert-manager is installed as pre-requirements
   ```

## Set storage class variable

The HM cluster requires a predefined storage class:

```
export STORAGE_CLASS=<storage class> # Customer storage class on OpenShift Container Platform
```

## Set authentication variables

Some authentication values are needed for installing HM:

```
export AUTHENTICATION_EMAIL=<email> # The email address of the user.
export AUTHENTICATION_HASH=<password hash>  # The hashed password of the user obtained for example as: echo "mypassword" | htpasswd -BinC 10 admin | cut -d: -f
export AUTHENTICATION_USERNAME=<Owner MyCompany> # The username of the user
export AUTHENTICATION_USER_ID="c5998173-a605-449a-a9a5-4a9c33e26df7" # A unique identifier for the user must not be changed since the first time installation.
```

## Optional: set FIPs mode Transporter Data Operator

Optionally, you can set FIPS mode for Transporter Data Operator:

```
export TRANSPORTER_FIPS_ENABLED=true # Enable FIPS mode for Transporter Data Operator
```
