The HM cluster needs access to certain user domains during the installation.

## Set domain variables

```
export DEFAULT_INGRESS_DOMAIN=<rhos default ingress domain name> # rhos default ingress domain
```

!!! Important

    `DEFAULT_INGRESS_DOMAIN` is the default ingress domain name of the cluster.
    You can query it using the following command:

    ```
    oc get ingresses.config/cluster -o jsonpath={.spec.domain}
    ```

    The ingresses.config/cluster object is created during the installation.

    See [the OpenShift documentation](https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/openshift_container_platform/4.17/html/networking/configuring-routes#nw-creating-a-route_route-configuration) for more.

```

export OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_DOMAIN_NAME=<openshift console domain name> # Domain name to OpenShift console
export PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME=<portal domain name> # Customer domain name for the EDB Postgres AI Platform Portal
export TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME=<transporter rw service domain name> # Customer domain name for the EDB Postgres AI Platform Transporter RW Service
```

!!! Important

    `PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME` and `TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME` must be:

    -   distinct from each otherâ€”do not use the same name for both
    -   distinct from `OPENSHIFT_CONSOLE_DOMAIN_NAME`
    -   formatted as `<app-name>.<cluster-domain>`

```
export BEACON_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME=<beacon service domain name> # Customer domain name for the EDB Postgres AI Beacon Service
export CERT_MANAGER_NAMESPACE=<cert-manager namespace> # Customer namespace in which cert-manager is installed as pre-requirements
```

## Set storage class variable

The HM cluster requires a predefined storage class:

```
export STORAGE_CLASS=<storage class> # Customer storage class on OpenShift Container Platform
```

## Set authentication variables

Some authentication values are needed for installing HM:

```
export AUTHENTICATION_EMAIL=<email> # The email address of the user.
export AUTHENTICATION_HASH=<password hash>  # The hashed password of the user obtained for example as: echo "mypassword" | htpasswd -BinC 10 admin | cut -d: -f
export AUTHENTICATION_USERNAME=<Owner MyCompany> # The username of the user
export AUTHENTICATION_USER_ID="c5998173-a605-449a-a9a5-4a9c33e26df7" # A unique identifier for the user must not be changed since the first time installation.
```

## Optional: set FIPs mode Transporter Data Operator

Optionally, you can set FIPS mode for Transporter Data Operator:

```
export TRANSPORTER_FIPS_ENABLED=true # Enable FIPS mode for Transporter Data Operator
```
