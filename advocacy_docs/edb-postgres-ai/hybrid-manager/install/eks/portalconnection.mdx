To verify that your [installation](installing.mdx) of the EDB Software Deployment platform was successful, connect to the HCP Portal using your browser. 

Connect to the portal by entering the URL in your browser:

```shell
https://portal.foo.network/
```

In this configuration, the https doesn;t validate, as the hostname doesn't exist on the wider internet. Accept the certificate warning to proceed to the portal.

At the login screen, you can enter the username and password generated with the [bootstrap installation](installing.mdx#obtain-the-bootstrap-kit). See [Managing users](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/managing_users/) for more information.

After you've logged in, you can [create a database cluster](../../using_hybrid_manager/cluster_management/create-clusters/).
