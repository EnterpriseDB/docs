title: Creating an EKS cluster
navTitle: Create EKS cluster

---

After you have [installed your system](installsystem.mdx) and [configured your AWS account](awsaccount.mdx), you can create an EKS cluster using the AWS Management Console.

## Step 1: Log in to the AWS Management Console

Log in with your account credentials at <https://aws.amazon.com/console/> to get to the management console.

Enter `EKS` in the search bar and select **Elastic Kubernetes Service** from the search results.

## Step 2: Obtain the bootstrap kit

You install Hybrid Manager (HM) using a bootstrap kit. This kit is a collection of scripts and Helm charts that are used to install the EDB Software Deployment platform.

You need the following files:

-   [eks-fix-auto.sh](../assets/eks-fix-auto.sh)

Copy the file to a directory on your local machine and `cd` into that directory.

Then, using the AWS Management Console:

1.  Select the AWS region you want to create the cluster in.

2.  Make a note of the region you select. You will need this later in the process.

3.  Go to the EKS page. Enter `EKS` in the search bar and select **Elastic Kubernetes Service** from the search results.

4.  On the EKS page, select **Create Cluster**.

## Step 3: Configure the cluster

In the configuration options:

-   Select **Quick configuration (with EKS Auto Mode) - *new***.

-   In the **Cluster name** field, enter a name for your cluster and make a note of it.

-   In the **Kubernetes version** field, select the version you want to use. (The default is 1.31 for EKS Auto Mode.)

-   In the **Cluster IAM Role** field, leave the value `AmazonEKSAutoClusterRole`.

-   In the **Node IAM Role** field, leave the value `AmazonEKSAutoNodeRole`.

### Select or create a VPC for your cluster

You need to provide a VPC for your cluster. You can either create a VPC or use an existing one.

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Create a simple public VPC">

1.  Select **Create VPC**.

2.  On the **Create VPC** page, under **Resources to create**, select **VPC and more**.

3.  Enter the following information:

    -   Under **Name tag auto-generation**, enter a name for your VPC.

    -   Under **Number of Availability Zones**, select 3.

    -   Under **Number of public subnets**, ensure that 3 is selected.

    -   Under **Number of private subnets**, ensure that 3 is selected.

    -   Under NAT gateways, select **In 1 AZ**

4.  Select **Create VPC**. The **Create VPC workflow** page appears and steps through creating the VPC. When complete, select **View VPC**.

In the view of the VPC, for each public subnet in the resource map:

1.  Hover over the subnet and select the square box with arrow icon that appears. A page opens where you can edit the subnet.

2.  Select **Actions > Edit subnet settings**.

3.  Select **Auto-assign public IPv4 address > Enable auto-assign public IPv4 address**.

4.  Select **Save**.

Add tags for each public subnet:

1.  Select the **Tags** tab.
2.  Select **Manage Tags**
3.  Select **Add Tag**
4.  Enter `kubernetes.io/role/elb` in the **Key** field, and `1` in the **Value** field.
5.  Select **Save**
6.  Close the tab/window and return to the VPC view.

Add tags for each private subnet in the resource map:

1.  Hover over the subnet and select the square box with arrow icon that appears.
2.  Select the **Tags** tab.
3.  Select **Manage Tags**
4.  Select **Add Tag**
5.  Enter `kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb` in the **Key** field, and `1` in the **Value** field.
6.  Select **Save**
7.  Close the tab/window and return to the VPC view.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Select an existing VPC">

If you have an existing VPC you want to use, select it from the dropdown.

The VPC must have at least two public subnets and two private subnets in different availability zones 
and must have the following tags:

Public subnets:

-   `kubernetes.io/role/elb`: `1` 

Private subnets:

-   `kubernetes.io/role/internal-elb`: `1`

</Tab>
</TabContainer>

### Return to the EKS cluster creation page

If you created a new VPC, you need to refresh the EKS cluster creation page. To refresh the dropdown so you can select the VPC you just created, select the circular arrow icon next to **Create VPC**. 

1.  Select the subnets for your cluster. You must select at least two private subnets in different availability zones.

    !!! Note

        These subnets must be private, not public, as their purpose is to facilitate communication between the Kubernetes control plane and the Kubernetes worker nodes.
        Public subnets could leave the cluster internals open to unnecessary security threats.
        The subnet tagging informs EKS to create the ingress load balancers on the correct subnets.

2.  Select **Create**.

The cluster is now being created. This can take a few minutes. You can monitor the creation on the EKS console by selecting **Clusters** in the breadcrumb at the top of the page.

## Step 4: Configure kubectl

After you create the cluster, you need to configure kubectl to interact with it.

Open your terminal and run:

```shell
aws eks --region <REGION> update-kubeconfig --name <CLUSTER-NAME>
```

Where:

-   `<REGION>` is the region in which you created the cluster. 
-   `<CLUSTER-NAME>` is the name you gave the cluster. 

!!! Note

    If you haven't set the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable, include the `--profile <profile-name>` option in the command.

You can now interact with your EKS cluster. To test, run:

```shell
kubectl get pods -A
```

## Step 5: Create an S3 bucket and connect it to the cluster

HM requires an S3 bucket to store backups and other data. Create an S3 bucket and connect it to the cluster.

### Create an S3 bucket

1.  Open the S3 service in the AWS Management Console. Enter `S3` in the search bar and select **S3** from the search results.

2.  Select **Create bucket**.

3.  Enter a name for the bucket name field. This must be globally unique.

4.  Select **Create Bucket**.

### Create the role for access

1.  Return to the EKS dashboard. Enter `EKS` in the search bar and select **Elastic Kubernetes Service** from the search results.

2.  Select the cluster you created.

3.  In the **Details** section of the overview, copy the OpenID Connect provider URL.

4.  Open the IAM service in the AWS Management Console. enter `IAM` in the search bar and select **IAM** from the search results.

5.  In the left menu, select **Identity Providers**.

6.  Select **Add Provider**.

7.  On the **Configure Provider** page, select **OpenID Connect**, then paste the URL you copied into the **Provider URL** field.

8.  In the audience field, enter `sts.amazonaws.com`.

9.  Select **Add Provider**.

    A green banner displays the message `Provider created successfully` and an **Assign Role** button appears. 

10. Select **Assign Role**.

11. Under **Role Options**, select **Create a New Role**. Select **Next**.

Select a trusted entity:

1.  On the **Select trusted entity** page, select **Web identity**.

    In the **Web identity** section, the **Identity Provider** field shows the provider you just created. 

2.  Select `sts.amazonaws.com` in the **Audience** field and select **Next**.

Grant permissions to the new role:

1.  On the **Add Permissions** page, enter `s3full` to the search field. Select the `AmazonS3FullAccess` policy and select **Next**.

2.  Enter a role name, such as `<clustername>-s3access`, and select **Create Role**.

    A green banner displays with the message `Role created successfully` and a **View Role** button appears. 

3.  Select **View Role**.

4.  In the view of the role, copy the role's **ARN** value.

### Create the secret

You must create the secret in the default namespace (`-n default`) for it to function correctly.

In your terminal, run:

```shell
 kubectl create secret generic -n default edb-object-storage \
     --from-literal auth_type=workloadIdentity \
     --from-literal aws_region=<REGION> \
     --from-literal aws_role_arn=<ROLE-ARN> \
     --from-literal bucket_name=<BUCKET-NAME>
```

Where:

-   `<REGION>` is the region where you are creating the cluster.
-   `<ROLE-ARN>` is the ARN of the role you created.
-   `<BUCKET-NAME>` is the name of the bucket you created.

## Step 6: Add the EBS CSI driver and CSI snapshot controller

The PGAIHM requires two AWS CSI-related drivers to manage snapshots correctly: the EBS CSI driver and CSI snapshot controller.

### AWS EBS CSI driver

The EBS CSI diver allows Kubernetes clusters to dynamically provision and manage storage resources using AWS services like Elastic Block Store (EBS) and Elastic File System (EFS).
The integration helps Kubernetes workloads seamlessly use AWS storage services as persistent storage.

To install the EBS CSI driver:

1.  In the EKS cluster page of the EKS cluster you're installing PGAIHM on, select the **Add-ons** tab.

2.  Select **Get More Addons**.

3.  On the **Add-ons** page, on the tile for EBS CSI Driver, select the check box, then select **Next**.

4.  On the **Configure** page, select **Next**. 

5.  On the **Review** page, select **Create**.

The EBS CSI add-on driver is added to your cluster.

### AWS CSI snapshot controller

The CSI snapshot controller is a Kubernetes controller that manages volume snapshots.

To install the CSI snapshot controller:

1.  In the EKS cluster page of the EKS cluster you are installing PGAIHM on, select the **Add-ons** tab.

2.  Select **Get More Addons**.

3.  On the **Add-ons** page, on the tile for CSI Snapshot Controller, select the check box, then select **Next**.

4.  On the **Configure** page, select **Next** 

5.  On the **Review** page, select **Create**.

The CSI snapshot controller add-on is added to your cluster.

## Step 7: Update the cluster for compatibility

The EKS cluster created by the AWS Management Console isn't fully compatible with HM, so you need to make some changes to the cluster. A script is available to make those changes for you.

Download the [eks-fix-auto.sh](../assets/eks-fix-auto.sh) script and run it in your terminal.

```shell
$SHELL eks-fix-auto.sh
```

The script replaces the default nodepool and storage classes with ones more appropriate for the workload and configures a few other settings.

## Step 8: Install Hybrid Manager

Next, [Install the Hybrid Manager on EKS](../installing.mdx).
