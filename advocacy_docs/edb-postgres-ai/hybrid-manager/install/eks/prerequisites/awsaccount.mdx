To install a Hybrid Manager cluster, you need an AWS account with privileges to create the necessary resources.

## Required permissions

To create an EKS cluster, you need an AWS account with the following permissions:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "eks:*",
                "sts:AssumeRole",
                "iam:CreateRole",
                "iam:DeleteRole",
                "iam:GetRole",
                "iam:GetRolePolicy",
                "iam:PutRolePolicy",
                "iam:PassRole",
                "iam:ListPolicies",
                "iam:ListRolePolicies",
                "iam:ListAttachedRolePolicies",
                "iam:ListRoleTags",
                "iam:TagRole",
                "iam:GenerateServiceLastAccessedDetails",
                "iam:ListInstanceProfilesForRole",
                "iam:ListOpenIDConnectProviders",
                "iam:GetOpenIDConnectProvider",
                "iam:CreateOpenIDConnectProvider",
                "iam:TagOpenIDConnectProvider",
                "iam:GetServiceLastAccessedDetails",
                "iam:AttachRolePolicy",
                "ec2:TerminateInstances",
                "iam:deleteOpenIDConnectProvider",
                "iam:detachRolePolicy",
                "iam:DeleteRolePolicy"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
```

We recommend that you create a role with the above permissions and add it to your existing permissions by attaching it to your user. We also recommend that you review these permissions with your security team to ensure they're appropriate for your use case.

## Create an AWS account

If you don't already have an AWS account, you can create one on the [AWS website](https://aws.amazon.com/). Select **Create an AWS Account** and follow the instructions.

## Create an IAM user

1.  Log in to the [AWS Management Console](https://aws.amazon.com/console/). 

2.  Navigate to the IAM service by searching for **IAM** in the search bar.

3.  In the IAM dashboard, in the left menu, select **Users**, then select **Add user**.

4.  Enter a username for the new user and select the **Programmatic access** check box. 

5.  Select **Next: Permissions**.

6.  Attach a policy. In the **Set permissions** step, select **Attach existing policies directly** and search for the AdministratorAccess policy. Select the policy and select **Next: Tags**.

7.  If you want, add tags to the user and select **Next: Review**.

8.  Review the user details. To create the IAM user, select **Create user**.

!!! note

    Record the access key ID and secret access key. You will need them to configure the AWS CLI.

## Configure the AWS CLI

To configure the AWS CLI, you first need the AWS CLI installed on your local machine. (You perform this step as part of the [Install system](installsystem.mdx) prerequisite).

To configure the CLI, run:

```bash
aws configure
```

## Next steps

After you configure the AWS CLI, you can [create an EKS cluster](ekscluster.mdx).
