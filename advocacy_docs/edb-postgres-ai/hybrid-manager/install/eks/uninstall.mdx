Uninstalling Hybrid manager from an EKS cluster is dependent on how you installed it.

## Uninstalling using the bootstrap installed Hybrid Manager

If you installed Hybrid Manager using the bootstrap installation, you can uninstall it by running the following command:

```bash
helm uninstall -n edbpgai-bootstrap edbpgai-bootstrap edbpgai/edbpgai-bootstrap
```

This command will remove the Hybrid Manager components that were installed using the bootstrap method.

## Uninstalling using the Hybrid Manager Operator


To uninstall the Hybrid Manager Operator, you can run the following commands:

```bash
# by default, EDB Postgres AI is protected from the deletion, disable the protection first
kubectl annotate hybridcontrolplane edbpgai biganimal.enterprisedb.io/deletion-protect=disabled --overwrite
# uninstall the EDB Postgres AI
kubectl delete hybridcontrolplane edbpgai --wait=false
# monitor the uninstallation process
kubectl get hybridcontrolplane edbpgai -o yaml
```

This will remove the Hybrid Manager Operator and all associated resources from your EKS cluster.

## Post uninstallation

Note that after uninstalling Hybrid Manager, your EKS cluster still retains resources created as a side effect of the installation. 
You can remove these resources manually if you no longer need them, keep them for future use, or delete the EKS cluster itself, which will remove all resources associated with it.
