You can install the Hybrid Manager on [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) using the Hybrid Manager Operator. This is a Helm chart that deploys the Hybrid Manager platform on your EKS cluster. The operator is responsible for managing the lifecycle of the Hybrid Manager platform, including installing, upgrading, and uninstalling the platform.

!!! Important

    Complete the [prerequisites](../prerequisites) before you start this part of the installation process. It will step through the process of creating an EKS cluster, installing the necessary components, and configuring the environment ready for the Hybrid Manager Operator.

## Set the version to install

The version of the EDB Hybrid Manager platform is set by the environment variable EDB_PLATFORM_VERSION. This should be set to the version of the platform you wish to install. For example, to install version v1.2.0, you would set the environment variable as follows:

```shell
export EDB_PLATFORM_VERSION="v1.2.0"
```

## Set your token

This installation process requires that you save your EDB subscription token as an environment variable. You can obtain it by going to your [EDB Account Profile](https://www.enterprisedb.com/accounts/profile). (Log in if prompted to.) There you will find an entry for Repos 2.0 token:

![Repo Token](../../../images/repo-token.png)

Take this value and set it as an environment variable:

```shell
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN="your-token"
```

## Obtain the bootstrap kit

Hybrid Manager is installed using a bootstrap kit. This kit is a collection of scripts and charts that are used to install the EDB Hybrid Manager platform.

- [eks-install-operator.sh](assets-op/eks-install-operator.sh) - This script installs the Hybrid Manager Operator on your EKS cluster.
- [eks-install-secrets.sh](assets-op/eks-install-secrets.sh) - This script installs the secrets required for the installation process.
- [prepare-op.sh](assets-op/prepare-op.sh) - This script prepares the values file for the installation process.
- [default-env.sh](assets-op/default-env.sh) - This file contains the default environment variables for the installation process.
- [hm-default.yaml](../assets-op/hm-default.yaml) - This file contains the default values for a configuration.

Copy all files to a directory on your local machine and `cd` into that directory.

### Install the Hybrid Manager Operator

To install the Hybrid Manager Operator, run the `eks-install-operator.sh` script.
(As you already set the token as an environment variable, you can pipe it into the script).
You will also need to set the environment variable `OPERATOR_VERSION` to the version of the operator you wish to install, for example `v1.2.0`.
This will typically be the same version as the EDB Hybrid Manager platform you are installing, so you can set it as follows:

```shell
export OPERATOR_VERSION=$EDB_PLATFORM_VERSION
```

Then you can run the script to install the operator:

```shell
echo $EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN | $SHELL eks-install-operator.sh
```

## Install secrets

The install process requires a number of secrets to be installed in the Kubernetes cluster. These secrets are used to authenticate with the EDB Download Repository and to store the credentials for the EDB Software Deployment platform.

to install the secrets required for the bootstrap process, run the `install-secrets.sh` script. (As you already set the token as an environment variable, you can pipe it into the script.)

```shell
echo $EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN | $SHELL eks-install-secrets.sh
```

```console
Enter the password for pgai-platform@docker.enterprisedb.com
namespace/edbpgai-bootstrap created
namespace/upm-replicator created
secret/edb-cred created
secret/edb-cred created
secret/edb-cred annotated
namespace/upm-griptape created
secret/fernet-secret created
namespace/upm-lakekeeper created
secret/pg-confounding-key created
PG_CONFOUNDING_KEY is 01234567890123456789ABCDEFG - store safely
```

This process creates secrets needed for Hybrid Manager to run. You can find out more about these secrets in:

-   **[A secret for Griptape and configures DeltaLake object storage](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/install/customization/genai_secret/) (optional for GenAI Builder)**

-   **[A secret for Catalog](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/install/customization/data_catalog_secret/) (optional for using Catalog)**

-   See also **[custom secrets for Migration Portal](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/install/customization/migration_portal_secrets/) (optional to secure internal communications with Migration Portal)**

## Prepare the values file

The bootstrap process requires a number of values to be set in the Helm chart. These values are stored in a file called `values.yaml`. You can create this file by running the `prepare.sh` script, which uses variables from the `default-env.sh` file. Edit the `default-env.sh` file to set the values you require.

This is the default `default-env.sh` file:

```shell
# exports for EKS
export EDB_PLATFORM_VERSION="v1.2.0"
export CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URI="docker.enterprisedb.com/pgai-platform"
export IMAGESET_REGISTRY_URI=$CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URI
export IMAGESET_AUTHTYPE="token"
export PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME="portal.foo.network"
export TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME="transporter.foo.network"
export BEACON_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME="beacon.foo.network"
export AUTHENTICATION_EMAIL="owner@mycompany.com"
export AUTHENTICATION_USER="owner@mycompany.com"
export LOCATION_NAME="default-location"
export STORAGE_CLASS="gp2"
export TRANSPORTER_FIPS_ENABLED=false

# Set a password hash for the user or pass a password to have it hashed for you.
# If you pass a password, you will need to remove it from your history.
# You can hash a password using the following command:
# echo -n "password" | htpasswd -BinC 10 admin | cut -d: -f2
#

# export AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD="password"
# If setting AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD_HASH, ensure it is single quoted to prevent variable expansion (e.g. $2y$10$...).
export AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD_HASH='$2y$10$vKOAXfLHbeV1OQxMpxlLdOIwnX.JAN.ZrD9ZU//ocrNQwhQIMtXhy'
```

Here is a brief guide to the variables in the `default-env.sh` file.

| Variable                           | Description                                                                                                                                |

<Tab title="Automatically">

Run the `prepare-op.sh` script to create the `values.yaml` file.

```shell
$SHELL prepare-op.sh
```

This create a `values.yaml` file with the values set in the `default-env.sh` file.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Manually">

You need to create two values for the bootstrap process. These are the AES_256_KEY and the AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD_HASH. You can create these values with the following commands:

```shell
export AES_256_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
```

If you have a password to hash, you can do so with the following command:

```shell
export AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD_HASH=$(echo -n $AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD | htpasswd -BinC 10 admin | cut -d: -f2)
```

You now need to edit `values.yaml` file and set the values required for your installation. Find the appropriate key in the `values.yaml` file and set the values as follows. Replace `$<name>` entries with the value you have set the environment variables of the same name to.

1.  Set `spec.componentsParameters.upm-istio-gateway.cookie_aeskey` to $AES_256_KEY.
1.  Set `spec.imageRegistry` to $CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URI.
1.  Set `spec.globalParameters.portal_domain_name` to $PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME.
1.  Set `spec.componentsParameters.transporter-rw-service.domain_name` to $TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME.
1.  Set `spec.componentsParameters.transporter-dp-agent.rw_service_url` to `https://` followed by $TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME followed by `/transporter`. eg, given the values above, this would be `https://transporter.foo.network/transporter`.
1.  Set `spec.componentsParameters.upm-beacon.server_host` to $BEACON_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME.
1. Set `spec.pgai.portal.authentication.staticPasswords[0].email` to $AUTHENTICATION_EMAIL.
1. Set `spec.pgai.portal.authentication.staticPasswords[0].hash` to $AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD_HASH.
1. Set `spec.pgai.portal.authentication.staticPasswords[0].username` to $AUTHENTICATION_USER.
1. Set `spec.pgai.portal.authentication.staticPasswords[0].userID` "c5998173-a605-449a-a9a5-4a9c33e26df".
1. Set `spec.beaconAgent.location` to $LOCATION_NAME
1. Set `spec.globalParameters.storage_class` to $STORAGE_CLASS.
1. Set `spec.componentsParameters.transporter-data-operator.fips_enabled` to $TRANSPORTER_FIPS_ENABLED. (Ensure the boolean value is quoted as it is handled as a string.)

</Tab>
</TabContainer>

The `hm-values.yaml` file should now contain the values required for the installation process.

## Install the Hybrid Manager platform

The next step is to apply the values file which you created in the previous step to the Hybrid Manager Operator. This will trigger the installation of the Hybrid Manager platform on your EKS cluster.

```shell
kubectl apply -f ./hm-values.yaml
```

You can check the status of the installation by running:

```shell
kubectl get hybridcontrolplanes.edbpgai.edb.com
```

When complete, the output should look similar to this:

```console
NAME      PHASE
edbpgai   deployed
```

If not deploying, run:

```shell
kubectl get hybridcontrolplanes.edbpgai.edb.com -o yaml
```

For more information on the status of the installation, you can check the logs of the Hybrid Manager Operator:

## Configure host name resolution

Obtain the IP address of your ingress gateway to configure in your `/etc/hosts` file. Run:

```shell
kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}' | strings | nslookup
```

This command returns output like:

```console
Server:         192.168.111.1
Address:        192.168.111.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   k8s-istiosys-istioing-b3dc9b4f3c-81dc5c45b1d5f6d2.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Address: 52.70.180.102
```

You now need to configure your DNS service or your `/etc/hosts` file to point the domains specified in `default-env.sh` to the IP address you obtained from the command above. Those domains are in `PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME`, `TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME`, and `BEACON_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME`. In the example above, they are set to `portal.foo.network`, `transporter.foo.network`, and `beacon.foo.network` respectively. 

### Configure DNS

In your DNS configuration, create a CNAME record for each of these domains that points to the IP address you obtained. So for our example, you would create the following records in your DNS zone file for `foo.network`:

```text
cluster IN A 52.70.180.102
portal      IN CNAME cluster.foo.network
transporter IN CNAME cluster.foo.network
beacon      IN CNAME cluster.foo.network
```

This is a simplified example. The actual configuration will depend on your DNS provider and how you manage your DNS records.

### Configure `/etc/hosts` (if no DNS service)

If you do not have a DNS service configured, consider adding the IP address to your local `/etc/hosts` file. This will allow you to access the Hybrid Manager portal using the domain name you set in the `default-env.sh` file.

You can then add IP address to your `/etc/hosts` file like this:

```shell
echo "52.70.180.102 portal.foo.network transporter.foo.network beacon.foo.network" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Substitute the IP address with the value you obtained earlier. Note that this is a temporary solution and should not be used in production environments. It is recommended to use a proper DNS service for production deployments. The settings in the `/etc/hosts` file will only work on the machine where you set them.

## Next steps

You can now verify the installation by [connecting to the HM Console](../portalconnection.mdx).
