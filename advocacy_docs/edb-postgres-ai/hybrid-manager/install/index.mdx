# Installing the PG AI Hybrid Manager

**PG AI Hybrid Manager** (HM) provides orchestration, observability, and lifecycle operations for Postgres, analytics, and AI workloads across cloud and on-premises deployments.

This section provides installation guidance for users deploying Hybrid Manager on their own infrastructure, across supported Kubernetes platforms. If you're using a turnkey hardware system like [Sovereign AI and Data Factory](../system), Hybrid Manager is preinstalled and requires no setup.

---

## Before you install

Hybrid Manager requires a Kubernetes environment and access to platform-specific APIs for managing storage, networking, and node pools.

You can install Hybrid Manager in:

- Self-managed Kubernetes (on-premises or cloud)
- RedHat OpenShift clusters
- Cloud-managed Kubernetes (EKS, GKE)

Make sure to:

- Review system resource and storage requirements
- Choose a supported Postgres distribution (Advanced Server, Extended Server, PostgreSQL)
- Define access and RBAC requirements for your organization
