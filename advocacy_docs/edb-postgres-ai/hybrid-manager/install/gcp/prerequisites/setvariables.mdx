## Set domain variables

The Hybrid Manager (HM) cluster needs access to certain user domains during the installation.

1. Set the variable for the HM's Portal domain name:

    ```bash
    export PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME=<your-hm-portal-domain-name>
    ```

1. Set the variable for Transporter RW service domain name: 

    ```bash
    export TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME=<transporter rw service domain name> # Customer domain name for the EDB Postgres AI Platform Transporter RW Service
    ```

1. Set the variable for the EDB Postgres AI Agent domain name:

    ```bash
    export BEACON_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME=<beacon service domain name> # Customer domain name for the EDB Postgres AI Beacon Service
    ```

## Set storage class variable

The HM cluster requires a predefined storage class. :

```bash
 export STORAGE_CLASS=<storage class> 
```

One option is to use the default GKE storage class, `standard-rwo`.

## Set authentication variables

Some authentication values are needed for installing HM.

1. Set the variable for your email address:

```bash
export AUTHENTICATION_EMAIL=<your-email>
```

1. Set the variable for your password hash&mdash;the hashed password you obtained.
For example: `echo "mypassword" | htpasswd -BinC 10 admin | cut -d: -f`:

```bash
export AUTHENTICATION_HASH=<your-password-hash>  
```

1. Set the variable for your username.
Owner MyCompany is the default user name.

```bash
export AUTHENTICATION_USERNAME=<Owner MyCompany>
```

1. Set your user id:


```bash
export AUTHENTICATION_USER_ID="your-unique-user-identifier"
```

## Optional: set FIPs mode Transporter Data Operator

Optionally, you can set FIPS mode for the Transporter Data Operator:
