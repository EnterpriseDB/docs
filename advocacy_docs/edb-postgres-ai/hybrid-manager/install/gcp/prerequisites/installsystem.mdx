title: Install system

---

You need a system from which you can run the installation process. This system needs the following software installed:

- [kubectl](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/cluster-access-for-kubectl) to manage your Kubernetes cluster.
- [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to render and apply the Kubernetes manifest.

You can install these tools using the linked instructions or by using the instructions for your particular operating system that follow.

## macOS

Install kubectl and Helm:

```shell
brew install kubectl helm
```

## Linux

=== "Ubuntu"

!!! Note
    These instructions are for Ubuntu 16.04 or newer, as they assume Snap support is available by default.

```shell
sudo snap install helm --classic
sudo snap install kubectl --classic
```

=== "Red Hat"


Install kubectl:

```
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -L -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
chmod +x kubectl
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/
kubectl version --client
```

Install Helm:

```
curl -LO https://get.helm.sh/helm-v3.12.3-linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar -xvf helm-v3.12.3-linux-amd64.tar.gz
sudo mv linux-amd64/helm /usr/local/bin/helm
helm version
```            

=== "Debian"

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install snapd
sudo snap install snapd
sudo snap install kubectl --classic
```

## Windows

=== "Winget"

```shell
winget install kubectl --source winget
winget search helm
winget install helm
```

=== "Manually"

1. Install [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl-windows/).

1. Install [Helm](#installing-helm).

#### Installing Helm

1.  Download the Helm binary for Windows. On the Helm [GitHub Releases page](https://github.com/helm/helm/releases), locate the latest release and download the helm-v3.x.x-windows-amd64.zip file.

2.  Extract the Zip file. Use a tool like 7-Zip, WinRAR, or the built-in Windows extraction utility to unzip the downloaded file.

3.  Copy `helm.exe` from the extracted folder to a directory in your path. Common directories include `C:\Program Files\`, `C:\Program Files (x86)\`, or you can create a directory, such as `C:\Helm\`, and add it to your path.

4.  Verify the installation:

    1.  Open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window.

    2.  Run the following command to verify that Helm is installed correctly:

        ```bash
        helm version
        ```

    3.  The output displays Helm version information.

## Next steps

Once you have installed the necessary software, you can move on to setting up an GCP account with the necessary permissions.
