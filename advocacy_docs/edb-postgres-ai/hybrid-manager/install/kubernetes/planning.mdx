title: Planning Your Kubernetes Cluster for Hybrid Manager Installation

---

When preparing to deploy Hybrid Manager (HM), make certain to first consider the following preliminary aspects of the design:

## 1. Use Case

-   What workloads need to be managed?

-   Are you deploying in production, testing, or a hybrid environment?

## 2. Base Infrastructure

-   Is the cluster to be hosted by a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) or on-premises?
    -   For on-premises, consider bare-metal, VM, or private cloud options.

## 3. Networking

-   Availability zones and subnets (public/private)

-   NAT Gateway/Egress

-   Network security rules

-   Resource tagging and latency considerations

-   **Network security**

    -   Cluster network policies
        -   Implement Kubernetes network policies to control traffic flow between pods, namespaces, and external resources.
    -   Encrypted communication
        -   Use TLS for all communication between HM components and external clients.
        -   Ensure in-cluster service communication is encrypted
    -   Firewalls and security groups
        -   For on-premises deployments, configure firewalls to restrict access to Kubernetes API servers and control-plane nodes.
        -   For cloud-based deployments, utilize security groups to restrict inbound and outbound traffic to the cluster

## 4. Kubernetes Cluster Settings

-   Kubernetes version.

-   Identity management (e.g., LDAP, SAML, OpenID Connect).

-   Resource tags, secrets/config maps.

-   Taints and tolerations for node groups.

## 5. Node Group Configuration

-   Instance types and compute groupings.

## 6. Permission Policies

-   PGAIHM needs permissions to the whole Kubernetes cluster

-   Node role permissions and RBAC settings.

-   Quotas and limit ranges.

-   Network policies.

## 7. Storage Integration

-   CSI drivers and object storage (e.g., S3-compatible).

-   Volume types, persistent volume claims, and snapshot support.

## 8. Load Balancer/Ingress Integration

-   Cloud provider or on-premises specifics.

-   Permissions for load balancer integration.

## 9. Data security

```
- Encryption at rest
    - Ensure persistent volumes used by HM have encryption enabled
    - Use a storage backend that supports encryption (e.g. AWS S3 for backups in EKS, NVMe with encryption for local storage on-premises)
- Encryption in transit
    - Enable encryption for all data transfer between HM components and the database clusters they manage.
- Secrets management
    - Store all sensitive information (e.g. database passwords, API keys) in Kubernetes Secrets.
    - Use a secure external secrets manager (e.g. HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) when possible.
```

## 10. Platform-Specific Custom Configurations

-   Differences between Red Hat OpenShift, AWS EKS, and other distributions.

By addressing these considerations, you can ensure your Kubernetes cluster is properly configured to support HM in any deployment scenario.
