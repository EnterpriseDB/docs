# Tiered Tables in Hybrid Manager

Tiered Tables in Hybrid Manager (HM) provide an automated solution for managing large time-series or historical datasets by moving older data from PGD clusters to cost-effective object storage in Apache Iceberg format.

Hybrid Manager integrates this capability across:

- PGD clusters with BDR AutoPartition
- PGAA extensions for offloading
- Lakehouse clusters for querying
- Centralized catalog services (Lakekeeper or external Iceberg catalogs)

For a conceptual overview of Tiered Tables, see [Understanding Tiered Tables with EDB Postgres](../../explained/tiered-tables).

## Why use Tiered Tables with Hybrid Manager

- **Lower storage costs:** Offload "cold" data to object storage (Iceberg) and shrink primary PGD transactional tables.
- **Faster transactional performance:** Keep "hot" data partitions small for efficient PGD operations.
- **Automated lifecycle management:** Move data across tiers automatically based on age.
- **Transparent analytics:** Query both hot and cold data via PGD parent table or Lakehouse cluster.
- **Unified management:** Configure and monitor all components through Hybrid Manager.

## How Tiered Tables work in your HM architecture

- **PGD clusters:** Manage partitioning and automatic offload of old partitions to Iceberg.
- **PGFS storage locations:** Define object storage targets for offload.
- **Iceberg catalogs:** Optionally manage offloaded tables in a catalog (Lakekeeper or external).
- **Lakehouse clusters:** Provide scalable analytical compute to query offloaded Iceberg data.
- **Monitoring:** Use HM monitoring tools and observability queries to track offload status and storage savings.

## Prerequisites within EDB Hybrid Manager

Before implementing Tiered Tables in HM:

- **Active Hybrid Manager instance**
- **Provisioned PGD cluster:** Version 6.0+ with PGAA and PGFS extensions enabled
- **Lakehouse cluster (recommended):** For querying offloaded data
- **Catalog service:** Optional, but recommended â€” HM-managed Lakekeeper or external REST-compatible catalog
- **Machine user for catalog (if using catalog):** With appropriate catalog data writer/reader permissions
- **Object storage:** S3-compatible, with credentials if private
- **User permissions:** Database user must have create/alter/execute privileges for BDR and PGAA functions

## Main capabilities

- **Automated partitioning:** Define BDR AutoPartition strategy and analytics_offload_period.
- **Storage tiering:** Use PGFS or Iceberg catalog targets for offloaded data.
- **Query transparently:** PGD parent table queries can hit both local and Iceberg tiers. Lakehouse nodes can query Iceberg tables directly.
- **Monitor status:** Track offload progress, validate Iceberg content, and observe space savings.

## Use cases for Tiered Tables

- **Time-series data:** Logging, IoT, application telemetry
- **Archival:** Long-term retention of cold data for compliance
- **Historical trend analysis:** BI tools querying years of data without impacting PGD performance
- **Large, append-mostly tables:** Keep transactional footprint small while retaining full analytical access

## Observability tips

- Use HM dashboards for PGD cluster health and offload progress
- Run analytics queries on bdr.analytics_table and partition views
- Use pg_total_relation_size() to observe space reclaimed on PGD nodes
- Use cloud storage console or analytics to track Iceberg object size growth
