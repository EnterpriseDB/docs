description: Learn how to configure a PGD node group in Hybrid Manager to offload data to object storage for Tiered Tables.
---

After configuring a PGFS storage location, you must configure your **PGD node group** to offload analytics data for Tiered Tables.

You can choose to:

- **Offload without a catalog** (simpler setup — filesystem-based Iceberg tables), or
- **Offload to an Iceberg catalog** (recommended — enables interoperability with external tools)

## Why configure PGD node group for offload?

By configuring this:

- You enable **automatic offloading of cold partitions** created by BDR AutoPartition.
- You can control where your offloaded data is stored — either in raw filesystem paths or as catalog-managed Iceberg tables.
- This step is required to implement full **Tiered Tables** behavior.

For background, see:
[Tiered Tables in Hybrid Manager](../tiered_tables)

## Prerequisites

Before configuring PGD node group for offload:

- You have a **PGD cluster** provisioned in Hybrid Manager.
- You have created a PGFS storage location:
[Configure PGFS storage for Tiered Tables](./configure-tiered-pgfs)

- (Optional) You have configured an Iceberg catalog connection (recommended):
[Configure an Iceberg catalog connection](./configure-iceberg-catalog)

## Offloading without a catalog

If you want PGD to offload directly to raw Iceberg filesystem paths:

### Step 1: Identify your PGD node group

SELECT node_group_name FROM bdr.node_group;

Example result: `edb_pgdx_node_group_1`

### Step 2: Set the node group option `analytics_storage_location`

SELECT bdr.alter_node_group_option(
'edb_pgdx_node_group_1',
'analytics_storage_location',
'hm_tiered_analytics_store'
);

- Replace `'hm_tiered_analytics_store'` with the name of your PGFS storage location.

Result:

- PGD will offload eligible partitions into filesystem-based Iceberg tables at this location.

## Offloading with an Iceberg catalog (recommended)

If you want PGD to offload into **Iceberg catalog-managed tables**:

### Step 1: Ensure your catalog is configured and attached

SELECT pgaa.add_catalog(
'hm_main_lakekeeper',
'iceberg-rest',
'{
"url": "https://hm.example.com/catalog/v1",
"token": "your_hm_api_key",
"warehouse": "lakehouse_warehouse_1"
}'
);

SELECT pgaa.attach_catalog('hm_main_lakekeeper');

### Step 2: Set the node group option `analytics_write_catalog`

SELECT bdr.alter_node_group_option(
'edb_pgdx_node_group_1',
'analytics_write_catalog',
'hm_main_lakekeeper'
);

- Replace `'hm_main_lakekeeper'` with the name of your attached catalog.

Result:

- PGD will offload eligible partitions as **Iceberg tables managed by this catalog**.

## Validate the configuration

Run this to verify:

SELECT * FROM bdr.node_group_option WHERE node_group_name = 'edb_pgdx_node_group_1';

You should see **either**:

- `analytics_storage_location` set (no catalog), or
- `analytics_write_catalog` set (using a catalog).

## Notes

- You must set **either** `analytics_storage_location` **or** `analytics_write_catalog`, not both.
- Using a catalog is strongly recommended if you want offloaded data to be queryable by:
- **Lakehouse clusters**
- **External analytics engines** (Spark, Trino, etc.)
- When using no catalog, offloaded tables will be written into filesystem paths in your PGFS location — suitable for internal use, but harder to interoperate.

## Next steps

Now that you have configured PGD node group offload:

- You can **configure AutoPartition to begin partitioning and triggering offload**:
[Configure BDR AutoPartition with analytics offload](./configure-tiered-autopartition)

- You can **monitor Tiered Table offload and storage savings**:
[Monitor Tiered Tables status and storage savings](./monitor-tiered-tables)

- You can **query Tiered Tables from PGD parent table or Lakehouse**:
[Query Tiered Tables from PGD and Lakehouse](./query-tiered-tables)

- If you need to adjust storage location or catalog later, simply run `bdr.alter_node_group_option()` again.
