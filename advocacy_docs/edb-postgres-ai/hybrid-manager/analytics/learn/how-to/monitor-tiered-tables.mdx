# Monitor Tiered Tables status and storage savings

After configuring Tiered Tables, it's important to monitor:

- Which partitions have been offloaded
- Whether offloading is progressing as expected
- Storage savings on PGD vs. object storage
- Offload-related activity on your PGD cluster

This guide explains how to monitor Tiered Tables from both:

- PGD (via SQL)
- Hybrid Manager (via monitoring dashboards, if available)

## Prerequisites

- Tiered Tables configured
See [Implementing Tiered Tables in EDB Hybrid Manager](../../tiered-tables)

## Monitor analytics table status

You can view which PGD tables are marked for analytics offload:

```SELECT * FROM bdr.analytics_table;
```
Useful columns:

- `relation`: the table name
- `state`: current offload state
- `enabled`
- `disabled`
- `in_progress`

## Monitor AutoPartition offload activity

Check the AutoPartition work queue for offload-related tasks:

```SELECT
wqs.workid, wis.ap_wi_started_at, wis.ap_wi_finished_at,
wis.ap_wi_status, "partition", sql
FROM bdr.taskmgr_local_workitem_status wis
RIGHT JOIN bdr.taskmgr_local_work_queue_status wqs
ON wis.ap_wi_workid = wqs.workid
WHERE sql NOT LIKE '%bdr.autopartition_create_partition%'
ORDER BY ap_wi_finished_at DESC;
```
This helps you track:

- When offload jobs ran
- Their status (success/failure)
- Which partition was affected

## Monitor storage savings on PGD

To observe the reduction in transactional storage used by the parent table:

```
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('public.application_logs'));
```
As partitions are offloaded and truncated, this size should decrease.

To compare local heap vs. offloaded sizes (advanced query):
