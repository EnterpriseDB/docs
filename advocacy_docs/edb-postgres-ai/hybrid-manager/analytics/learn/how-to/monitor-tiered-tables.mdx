---


After configuring Tiered Tables, it's important to monitor:

- Which partitions have been offloaded
- Whether offloading is progressing as expected
- Storage savings on PGD vs. object storage
- Offload-related activity on your PGD cluster

You can monitor Tiered Tables from both:

- **PGD cluster** — using SQL observability queries
- **Hybrid Manager** — via monitoring dashboards (if available in your environment)

## Why monitor Tiered Tables?

Monitoring Tiered Tables allows you to:

- Validate that offload is working as configured.
- Confirm that hot/cold partitioning is behaving as expected.
- Track storage savings and partition lifecycle.
- Troubleshoot issues with offload or partition management.

## Goals

After completing this How-To, you will be able to:

- Identify which tables are configured for offload and their current status.
- Monitor AutoPartition offload activity and job success.
- Measure storage savings on PGD primary storage.
- Use observability queries to monitor partition states.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

- Tiered Tables must be configured. See:
- [Configure PGFS storage for Tiered Tables](./configure-tiered-pgfs)
- [Configure PGD node group for analytics offload](./configure-tiered-offload)
- [Configure BDR AutoPartition with analytics offload](./configure-tiered-autopartition)

## Monitor analytics table status

To view which PGD tables are marked for analytics offload:
```sql
SELECT * FROM bdr.analytics_table;
```
Useful columns:

- `relation` — table name
- `state` — current offload state
- `enabled` — whether analytics offload is enabled
- `disabled` — whether offload is disabled
- `in_progress` — whether offload is currently running

## Monitor AutoPartition offload activity

Check the AutoPartition work queue for offload-related tasks:
```sql
SELECT
wqs.workid, wis.ap_wi_started_at, wis.ap_wi_finished_at,
wis.ap_wi_status, "partition", sql
FROM bdr.taskmgr_local_workitem_status wis
RIGHT JOIN bdr.taskmgr_local_work_queue_status wqs
ON wis.ap_wi_workid = wqs.workid
WHERE sql NOT LIKE '%bdr.autopartition_create_partition%'
ORDER BY ap_wi_finished_at DESC;
```
This helps you track:

- When offload jobs ran
- Their status (success/failure)
- Which partition was affected

## Monitor storage savings on PGD

To observe reduction in transactional storage used by the parent table:
```sql
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('public.application_logs'));
```
As partitions are offloaded and truncated, this size should decrease.

## Advanced observability — Heap vs. Offloaded size

To compare local heap vs. offloaded size for partitions:
You can run an advanced observability query from EDB's recommended runbooks.

- See the observability query from [EDB PGAA-Tiered-Tables-Observability-Queries](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/edb-postgres-runbooks/tree/main/pgaa-tiered-tables-observability-queries) (EDB public runbooks repository).

This allows you to see:

- Per-partition storage split across heap and Iceberg/Delta
- Remaining heap size vs. offloaded size

## What you can do next

Now that you can monitor Tiered Tables status and storage savings, you can:

- **Tune your partitioning and offload policies** — adjust `analytics_offload_period` if needed based on observed hot/cold access patterns.
- **Query Tiered Tables for analytics and BI workloads:**
- [Query Tiered Tables from PGD and Lakehouse](./query-tiered-tables)
- **Scale Lakehouse clusters appropriately** to handle offloaded data queries.
- **Validate compliance and retention goals** — confirm that old data is offloaded and retained per your policy.
