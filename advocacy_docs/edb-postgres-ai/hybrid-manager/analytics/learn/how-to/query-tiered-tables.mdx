navTitle: Query Tiered Tables
description: Learn how to query Tiered Tables from PGD and Lakehouse clusters in Hybrid Manager.
---

Once Tiered Tables are implemented, you can query both **hot data** (local PGD partitions) and **cold data** (offloaded Iceberg partitions) transparently.

This guide explains:

- How to query Tiered Tables from PGD
- How to query Tiered Tables from a Lakehouse cluster
- How the query planner routes queries
- How to query offloaded-only data

For background, see [Tiered Tables in Hybrid Manager](../../tiered_tables.mdx).

## Goals

After completing this guide, you will:

* Be able to query Tiered Tables transparently from PGD and Lakehouse
* Understand how the query planner accesses hot and cold data
* Know how to query **offloaded-only** partitions directly
* Know when to use the offloaded view for reports and analysis

---

## When to use this

You should follow this guide when:

- You have implemented Tiered Tables in Hybrid Manager
- You want to validate that hot + cold data is accessible in PGD queries
- You want to query only offloaded data from PGD or Lakehouse
- You want to optimize reports against historical (cold) data

---

## Prerequisites

- BDR AutoPartition with `analytics_offload_period` configured
See [Configure BDR AutoPartition with analytics offload](./configure-tiered-autopartition)

- PGD node group offload configured
See [Configure PGD node group for analytics offload](./configure-tiered-offload)

- (Optional) Lakehouse cluster connected to your Iceberg catalog
See [Query existing Apache Iceberg tables](./query-iceberg-existing-tables)

---

## Querying the parent table in PGD

The **parent partitioned table** (e.g. `public.application_logs`) is the unified interface for hot + cold data.

Example query:

```SELECT log_level, COUNT(*)
FROM public.application_logs
WHERE event_timestamp >= '2023-06-01' AND event_timestamp < '2024-06-01'
GROUP BY log_level;
```

**What happens under the hood:**

- Planner accesses **local PGD partitions** for hot data
- Planner accesses **Iceberg offloaded partitions** via PGAA for cold data
- Transparent to your query â€” no special syntax required

Tip: Run EXPLAIN ANALYZE to observe planner behavior.

---

## Querying offloaded data only (PGD)

PGAA creates an **offloaded view** automatically:

SELECT * FROM public.application_logs_offloaded;

This view queries **only offloaded partitions**.

Example:

```SELECT log_level, COUNT(*)
FROM public.application_logs_offloaded;
```

When to use the offloaded view:

- Reports targeting **cold / historical** data only
- Queries where you want to avoid scanning hot partitions
- Testing that offload is working as expected

---

## Querying offloaded data from Lakehouse

If PGD offload uses a catalog (recommended), attach the same catalog in your Lakehouse cluster:

```SELECT pgaa.add_catalog(...);

SELECT pgaa.attach_catalog(...);
```

Then query Iceberg tables directly:

```SELECT * FROM iot_data.application_logs_part_2023_jan;
```
Alternatively, you can replicate the `application_logs_offloaded` view logic from PGD into Lakehouse:

- Create a view that selects all catalog-managed offloaded partitions
- Useful for BI tools to match the PGD experience

---

## Notes on planner behavior

- The **parent table** is always the default recommended interface
- Planner automatically optimizes access to PGD vs Iceberg partitions
- Queries with **wide time windows** may benefit from targeting `application_logs_offloaded`
- The offloaded view is only created if AutoPartition was configured with `analytics_offload_period`

---

## Next steps

Now that you have queried Tiered Tables:

- You can [Monitor Tiered Tables status and storage savings](./monitor-tiered-tables) to track partition movement and space savings
- You can [Offload additional PGD data to Apache Iceberg](./offload-pgd-to-iceberg) for broader historical coverage
- You can [Query existing Apache Iceberg tables](./query-iceberg-existing-tables) to integrate with external tools and BI platforms
