# Solving business problems with analytics in Hybrid Manager

This page explores common analytics use cases and explains how Hybrid Manager (HM) features can help you address them.

By using EDB Postgres Lakehouse clusters, Tiered Tables with PGD, and integrations with open table formats (Apache Iceberg, Delta Lake), you can build flexible analytics solutions within your Postgres environment.

For foundational concepts, see [Analytics Accelerator concepts](../../analytics-concepts).
For persona-based guidance, see [Leveraging analytics in Hybrid Manager](./personas).

## Common use cases and HM solutions

### 1. Ad-hoc business intelligence and reporting on large datasets

**Challenge:**
Business users and data analysts need to run complex queries on large historical datasets without affecting operational PGD clusters.

**HM solution:**

- **Data storage:** Store large datasets in object storage as Iceberg or Delta Lake tables.
- **Lakehouse compute:** Provision Lakehouse clusters on HM for fast, vectorized query execution.
- **Connectivity:** Connect BI tools (Tableau, Power BI, Looker) to Lakehouse clusters using standard Postgres connectors.
- **Catalog integration:** Use an Iceberg catalog (HM-managed or external) for table discovery and management.

### 2. Cost-effective archival and analysis of time-series data

**Challenge:**
Manage growing time-series data cost-effectively while maintaining access for historical analysis.

**HM solution:**

- **Tiered Tables:** Configure PGD AutoPartition and define `analytics_offload_period` for automatic offload of cold partitions to Iceberg.
- **Lakehouse queries:** Query cold data in object storage using HM-managed Lakehouse clusters.
- **Transparent access:** Queries on PGD parent tables can access both hot and cold tiers.

### 3. Integrating operational data with an enterprise data lake

**Challenge:**
Combine data from PGD clusters with other enterprise data sources for unified analytics.

**HM solution:**

- **Data offloading:** Offload PGD data to object storage in Iceberg or Delta formats.
- **Catalog sharing:** Use a shared Iceberg catalog (HM-managed or external) to support interoperability.
- **Lakehouse queries:** Query shared Iceberg/Delta tables using Lakehouse nodes or external engines (Spark, Trino).

### 4. Accelerating analytical components of applications

**Challenge:**
Applications require analytical queries that could impact primary PGD cluster performance.

**HM solution:**

- **Query routing:** Route read-heavy analytical queries to dedicated Lakehouse clusters.
- **Materialized views:** Precompute aggregates in Lakehouse tables for faster application queries.
- **Tiered access:** Use Tiered Tables to manage time-series data efficiently across hot and cold storage.

**Benefits:**

- Protect PGD performance
- Provide scalable compute for application analytics
- Leverage cost-effective storage
