# Leveraging analytics in Hybrid Manager

This page provides role-based guidance on how to leverage analytics features within Hybrid Manager (HM).

Whether you are a Database Administrator, DevOps Engineer, Data Scientist, or Application Developer, Hybrid Manager provides tools to help you manage, analyze, and optimize your EDB Postgres deployments.

For foundational concepts, see [Analytics Accelerator concepts](../../analytics-concepts).

## Database Administrator (DBA)

**Primary focus:** performance, reliability, and cost-efficiency of HM-managed Postgres environments.

### Key objectives and HM features

- **Performance monitoring:** Use HM dashboards to monitor PGD clusters and Lakehouse nodes.
- **Storage optimization:** Implement Tiered Tables on PGD to offload cold data to object storage.
- **Capacity planning:** Analyze trends and scale Lakehouse clusters as needed.
- **Backup and recovery:** Use HM-managed backup for PGD and Lakehouse metadata (including catalogs).
- **Secure data access:** Control access to Lakehouse clusters through HM and Postgres security features.

## DevOps Engineer / SRE

**Primary focus:** automating deployment and observability of analytics infrastructure.

### Key objectives and HM features

- **Provisioning:** Use HM UI, API, or CLI to deploy PGD clusters and Lakehouse nodes.
- **Scaling:** Adjust Lakehouse cluster size as needed via HM.
- **Monitoring:** Track Lakehouse and PGD performance in HM dashboards.
- **Infrastructure as code:** Automate provisioning and configuration through HM API/CLI.
- **Cost management:** Use separate compute/storage architecture for optimization.

## Data Scientist / Data Analyst

**Primary focus:** efficiently accessing and analyzing data managed by Hybrid Manager.

### Key objectives and HM features

- **Data access:** Connect BI tools or analytical tools (Jupyter, R, SQL clients) to Lakehouse nodes.
- **Open table formats:** Query Iceberg and Delta Lake tables via Lakehouse.
- **Query large datasets:** Use vectorized Lakehouse nodes for fast analytics on large datasets.
- **Data preparation:** Use Postgres SQL on Lakehouse or PGD to clean and prepare data.

## Application Developer

**Primary focus:** building applications that interact with data managed by Hybrid Manager.

### Key objectives and HM features

- **Embedded analytics:** Connect applications to Lakehouse nodes or PGD read replicas for reporting.
- **Query optimization:** Route complex analytical queries to Lakehouse nodes.
- **Access hot and cold data:** Use Tiered Tables to manage time-series data across hot (PGD) and cold (Lakehouse) tiers.
- **AI integration (optional):** If using Gen AI Builder with HM, integrate Griptape Structures/Tools with applications.
