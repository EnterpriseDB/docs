## DevOps Engineer / SRE

**Primary focus:**
Automating deployment and observability of analytics infrastructure.

### Key objectives and HM features

- Use HM UI, API, or CLI to deploy PGD clusters and Lakehouse Clusters.
- Adjust Lakehouse Cluster size as needed via HM.
- Monitor Lakehouse and PGD performance in HM dashboards.
- Automate provisioning and configuration through HM API/CLI.
- Optimize cost using separate compute/storage architecture.

## Application Developer

**Primary focus:**
Building applications that interact with data managed by Hybrid Manager.

### Key objectives and HM features

- Connect applications to Lakehouse nodes or PGD read replicas for embedded reporting.
- Route complex analytical queries to Lakehouse nodes.
- Manage time-series data across hot (PGD) and cold (Lakehouse) tiers using Tiered Tables.
