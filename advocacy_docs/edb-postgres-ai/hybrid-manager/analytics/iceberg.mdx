# Apache Iceberg in Hybrid Manager

Apache Iceberg is an open table format for large analytical datasets stored in object storage.

Hybrid Manager (HM) integrates Iceberg capabilities into EDB Postgres deployments, enabling:

- Efficient querying of object storage via Lakehouse clusters
- Structured data offloading from PGD clusters to Iceberg format
- Centralized catalog management for Iceberg tables
- Interoperability with external analytics engines (Spark, Trino, etc.)

For a general overview of Iceberg, see [Apache Iceberg with EDB Solutions](../../explained/iceberg).

## Why use Iceberg with Hybrid Manager

Apache Iceberg provides an open, reliable, and performant foundation for analytics on large datasets. Using it through Hybrid Manager allows you to:

- Query Iceberg tables with high performance from Lakehouse clusters using vectorized execution.
- Offload transactional PGD data into Iceberg format for cost-efficient tiered storage and long-term analytics.
- Manage Iceberg catalogs centrally through HM or connect to external catalogs.
- Share data seamlessly between Postgres and other tools (Spark, Trino, Flink) using the Iceberg format.

## Key capabilities of Iceberg in Hybrid Manager

### Querying existing Iceberg tables

**What:** Run SQL queries on Iceberg tables already stored in object storage.

**Why:** Reuse data created by other tools (Spark, Trino, Flink, PGD offload) without ETL or duplication.

**How:** Use Lakehouse clusters to define PGAA external tables pointing to Iceberg data.

**Where:** Iceberg tables in S3-compatible object storage, either file-based or catalog-managed.

### Iceberg catalog integration

**What:** Connect Lakehouse and PGD nodes to Iceberg catalogs (HM-managed or external).

**Why:** Manage Iceberg table metadata centrally and query with consistent semantics.

**How:** Use PGAA functions (pgaa.add_catalog, pgaa.attach_catalog) to connect and import catalogs.

**Where:** HM-managed Lakekeeper catalog, or third-party catalogs (Glue, Nessie, Polaris).

### Offloading PGD data to Iceberg

**What:** Offload PGD transactional data into Iceberg format for analytical storage.

**Why:** Optimize storage costs and reduce PGD operational load while keeping data queryable.

**How:** Configure PGFS locations and/or Iceberg catalog, then enable analytics replication on PGD tables.

**Where:** Offloaded Iceberg tables in object storage, queryable by Lakehouse or other tools.

### Use cases for Iceberg in Hybrid Manager

- Archiving PGD data in Iceberg format while maintaining query access
- Centralized data lakehouse architecture with HM-managed catalog
- Ad-hoc analytics on large data volumes through Lakehouse clusters
- Implementing tiered storage and lifecycle management for PGD datasets

## Getting started with Iceberg in Hybrid Manager

To begin using Iceberg with Hybrid Manager:

1. Provision a Lakehouse cluster in HM.
2. Configure a PGFS storage location and/or an Iceberg catalog.
3. If offloading PGD data, configure PGD node group settings and enable analytics replication.
4. If querying existing Iceberg tables, define PGAA reader tables in your Lakehouse cluster.
5. Use standard Postgres clients to run analytical queries.
