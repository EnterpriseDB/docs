description: Learn how Hybrid Manager integrates with Apache Iceberg to manage large analytical datasets for EDB Postgres Lakehouse and PGD offloading.
---

Apache Iceberg is an open table format for large analytical datasets stored in object storage.

Hybrid Manager (HM) integrates Iceberg capabilities into EDB Postgres deployments, enabling:

- Efficient querying of object storage via Lakehouse clusters
- Structured data offloading from PGD clusters to Iceberg format
- Centralized catalog management for Iceberg tables
- Interoperability with external analytics engines (Spark, Trino, Flink, etc.)

For a general overview of Iceberg, see [Apache Iceberg with EDB Solutions](../../analytics/iceberg.mdx).

## Why use Iceberg with Hybrid Manager

Apache Iceberg provides an open, reliable, and performant foundation for analytics on large datasets. Using it through Hybrid Manager allows you to:

- Query Iceberg tables with high performance from Lakehouse clusters using vectorized execution.
- Offload transactional PGD data into Iceberg format for cost-efficient tiered storage and long-term analytics.
- Manage Iceberg catalogs centrally through HM or connect to external catalogs.
- Share data seamlessly between Postgres and other tools (Spark, Trino, Flink) using the Iceberg format.

## Key terms and architecture overview

For definitions of core analytics terms used in Hybrid Manager—such as PGFS, PGAA, Lakehouse Cluster, Catalog, AutoPartition, and Analytics Offload—see [Analytics Concepts in Hybrid Manager](learn/analytics_concepts.mdx).

## When should I use Iceberg with Hybrid Manager?

Use Iceberg with Hybrid Manager when you want to:

- **Archive PGD data cost-effectively** and still query it with Postgres or other tools.
- **Unify a data lakehouse architecture** with HM-managed or external Iceberg catalog.
- **Enable ad-hoc analytics** on large object storage datasets without ETL.
- **Implement Tiered Tables** to manage large time-series datasets and storage lifecycle in PGD.
- **Integrate Postgres and external data processing** tools using the Iceberg format.

## Key capabilities of Iceberg in Hybrid Manager

### Querying existing Iceberg tables

**What:** Run SQL queries on Iceberg tables already stored in object storage.

**Why:** Reuse data created by other tools (Spark, Trino, Flink, PGD offload) without ETL or duplication.

**How:** Use Lakehouse clusters to define PGAA external tables pointing to Iceberg data.

**Where:** Iceberg tables in S3-compatible object storage, either file-based or catalog-managed.

### Iceberg catalog integration

**What:** Connect Lakehouse and PGD nodes to Iceberg catalogs (HM-managed or external).

**Why:** Manage Iceberg table metadata centrally and query with consistent semantics.

**How:** Use PGAA functions (`pgaa.add_catalog`, `pgaa.attach_catalog`) to connect and import catalogs.

**Where:** HM-managed Lakekeeper catalog, or third-party catalogs (Glue, Nessie, Polaris).

[How-To: Create an Iceberg table in a catalog](./learn/how-to/create-iceberg-catalog-table)

**Note:** When using **Tiered Tables** or **PGD offload**, it is strongly recommended to use a catalog-managed Iceberg table for interoperability and lifecycle management.

### Offloading PGD data to Iceberg

**What:** Offload PGD transactional data into Iceberg format for analytical storage.

**Why:** Optimize storage costs and reduce PGD operational load while keeping data queryable.

**How:** Configure PGFS locations and/or Iceberg catalog, then enable analytics replication on PGD tables.

**Where:** Offloaded Iceberg tables in object storage, queryable by Lakehouse or other tools.

### Use cases for Iceberg in Hybrid Manager

- Archiving PGD data in Iceberg format while maintaining query access
- Centralized data lakehouse architecture with HM-managed catalog
- Ad-hoc analytics on large data volumes through Lakehouse clusters
- Implementing tiered storage and lifecycle management for PGD datasets
- Exposing PGD offloaded data to Spark, Trino, Flink pipelines using Iceberg format
