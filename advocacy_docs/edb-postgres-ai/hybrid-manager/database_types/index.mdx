HCP supports three cluster types:

-   [Single node](single_node.mdx)
-   [High availability](primary_standby_highavailability.mdx)
-   [Advanced high availability](advanced_highavailability.mdx)
-   [Distributed high availability](distributed_highavailability.mdx)

You choose the type of cluster you want on the [Create Cluster](../using-hybrid-manager/cluster-management/create-clusters/cluster-info.mdx) page.
