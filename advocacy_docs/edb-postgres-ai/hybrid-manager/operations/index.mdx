The Hybrid Manager is designed with flexibility in mind. To streamline deployment and ensure optimal performance, many advanced capabilities and integrations are not enabled by default. 

This section guides you through enabling these additional options, allowing you to customize your Hybrid Manager installation to fit your operational needs and specific use cases.

These guides require access to the underlying Kubernetes cluster. For most database operations, you can use the HCP Portal as detailed in the [HCP Portal User Guide](../use/index.md) and in the [HCP Guides](..).
