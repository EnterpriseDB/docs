description: How to get the credentials and connect to the database cluster you just created in the EDB Postgres AI Console.

The psql client is not the only client for Postgres. For example, pgAdmin 4 provides a rich graphical interface for working with Postgres databases. In this step, we'll show you how to connect to the database cluster you created in the [previous step](creating_a_database_cluster.mdx) using pgAdmin 4.


 
Assuming the cluster is ready, you'll see it as created in the **Clusters** view.

[The pgAdmin project](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) allows you to inspect, monitor, manage, and query your cluster's databases from a desktop or web UI. Download and install pgAdmin 4 on your local system. Run the application. It opens with a home screen which includes a **Quick Links** section. Click **Add New Server**.

You'll need the cluster credentials to connect to the database. Back at the Console's overview, select the lock icon on the right-hand side of the cluster entry to view the credentials. The lock icon is a short-cut to the **Connect** tab of the full cluster view. (You can also click the cluster name to view the full cluster details and then click the **Connect** tab.)

Assuming that you are using `psql` as your Postgres client as suggested in the [previous step](creating_a_database_cluster.mdx), we will proceed to connect to the database cluster.

From the welcome page of pgAdmin, select **Add New Server**. You're prompted to configure the connection.

Enter a name for the name field (or use the name you previously gave to your cluster!), and then select **Connection**.

1. In the **Host name/address** field, enter your cluster's hostname. This is the value in the Connect tab's **Read/Write Host** field.
1. In the **Maintenance database** field, enter `edb_admin`. This is the value in the Connect tab's **Dbname** field and is the database that pgAdmin initially connects to. 
1. In the **Username** field, enter `edb_admin`. This is the value in the Connect tab's **Username** field and is the user that pgAdmin connects with.
1. In the **Password** field, enter the password you provided when configuring your cluster. You may want to save this for convenience while testing.
1. Select the **SSL** tab, and change SSL mode to **Require**.
1. Select **Save**. 


At this point pgAdmin tries to establish a connection to your database. When successful, it displays the dashboard along with the list of available databases on the left.

You are now connected to the database cluster. To be precise, you are now logged in as the `edb_admin` user of the `edb_admin` database. Treat this user as a superuser and be careful with what you do. You can create new users and databases, and do anything else you need to do with the database.
