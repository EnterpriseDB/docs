This quickstart guide takes you through the steps to get started with the EDB Postgres AI Console and Cloud Service. You'll learn how to create an account on EDB Postgres AI, then use that account to create a single node database cluster on the Cloud Service. Finally, you'll learn how to connect to your new database cluster.

It starts with you [creating an account and signing in](create_account_and_sign_in).
