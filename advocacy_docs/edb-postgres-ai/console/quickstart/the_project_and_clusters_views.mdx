## The Project view

The project view is where you can create and manage resources. Each project is a collection of resources that relate to each other in some way.

<div style="border: 1px solid;margin: 1em auto 1em">

</div>

When there's no resources in the project, you'll see a message prompting you to create a resource using a **Create New** button. We're not going to use that button right now, as we're going to create our resource from the **Clusters** view. Select **Clusters** in the left-hand menu to view the clusters in the project.

## The Clusters view

The clusters view is where you can create and manage database clusters and similar resources. In Postgres terminology, a database cluster is a collection of databases that exist together. This view shows you all the clusters in the project, and includes a filter so you can search for a specific cluster.

<div style="border: 1px solid;margin: 1em auto 1em">

</div>

Of course this is a brand new account, so there are no clusters yet. Let's [create a database cluster](creating_a_database_cluster.mdx) next.
