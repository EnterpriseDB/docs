description: How to get the credentials and connect to the database cluster you just created in the EDB Postgres AI Console.

When the cluster is ready, you'll see it as created in the **Clusters** view.

</div>

You'll need the cluster credentials to connect to the database. Select the lock icon on the right-hand side of the cluster entry to view the credentials. The lock icon is a short-cut to the **Connect** tab of the full cluster view.

Assuming that you are using `psql` as your Postgres client as suggested in the [previous step](creating_a_database_cluster.mdx), we will proceed to connect to the database cluster.

Copy the Read/write URI to your clipboard. This URI is the connection string you'll use to connect to the database.

Open a terminal on your local system and type `psql "` and paste the URI you copied then type `"` to close the double quoted URI string. It should look something like this:

!!! tip Double quotes
Why the double quotes around the URI? The URI contains characters that are special to the shell, like `?` and `&`. The double quotes prevent the shell from interpreting these characters as special and instead pass them as part of the URI.
!!!

Your command line should look like this:

```bash
psql "postgres://edb_admin@p-n6wkzdbw1d.pg.biganimal.io:5432/edb_admin?sslmode=require"
```

Press ENTER. You'll see a password prompt. This is the password you copied earlier. Enter the password and press ENTER.

```
psql "postgres://edb_admin@p-n6wkzdbw1d.pg.biganimal.io:5432/edb_admin?sslmode=require"
__OUTPUT__
Password for user edb_admin: (enter the password you copied earlier)
psql (16.1, server 16.3 (Debian 16.3.0-1.bookworm))
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

edb_admin=>
```


You are now connected to the database cluster. To be precise, you are now logged in as the `edb_admin` user of the database. Treat this user as a superuser and be careful with what you do. You can create new users and databases, and do anything else you need to do with the database.
