description: How to get the credentials and connect to the database cluster you just created in the EDB Postgres AI Console with psql.

When the cluster is ready, you'll see it as created in the **Clusters** view. 

<div style="border: 1px solid;margin: 1em auto 1em">

![Quickstart Cluster Provisioned](images/qs_cluster_provisioned.png)

</div>

You'll need the cluster credentials to connect to the database. Select cluster's name to view the cluster details. On the first tab, **Overview**, you'll see a **Quick Connect** field.

<div style="border: 1px solid;margin: 1em auto 1em">

![Quickstart Connect Credentials](images/qs_overview_quick_connect.png)

</div>

This is a complete command for connecting to the database, assuming that is, that you are using `psql` as your Postgres client as suggested in the [previous step](creating_a_database_cluster.mdx).

Copy the **Quick Connect** field to your clipboard and paste it into a terminal on your local system.

Your command line should look like this:

```bash
psql "postgres://edb_admin@p-n6wkz0pihw.pg.biganimal.io:5432/edb_admin?sslmode=require"
```

Press enter. You'll see a password prompt. This is the password you copied earlier. Enter the password and press enter again.

```
psql "postgres://edb_admin@p-n6wkzdbw1d.pg.biganimal.io:5432/edb_admin?sslmode=require"
__OUTPUT__
Password for user edb_admin: (enter the password you copied earlier)
psql (16.1, server 16.3 (Debian 16.3.0-1.bookworm))
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

edb_admin=>
```


You are now connected to the database cluster. To be precise, you are now logged in as the `edb_admin` user of the database. Treat this user as a superuser and be careful with what you do. You can create new users and databases, and do anything else you need to do with the database.
