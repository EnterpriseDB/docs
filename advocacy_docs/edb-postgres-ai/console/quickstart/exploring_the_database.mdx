Now that you have created a database cluster and connected to it, you can start exploring the database. In this step, we'll show you how to use `psql` to connect to the database cluster and run some basic queries.

Assuming that you are using `psql` as your Postgres client as suggested in the [previous step](connecting_to_the_database_with_psql.mdx), proceed to connect to the database cluster.

Once you have connected you can run some basic queries. But first you'll want to create a database of your own to work with.


### Create a database

1. Create a user with the edb_admin role:
    ```sql
    CREATE USER explorer WITH PASSWORD 'yourpasswordhere';
    ```

1. Create a database:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE explore;
    ```
1. Grant the user access to the database:
    ```sql
    GRANT explorer to edb_admin;
    ```

1. Connect to the database:
    ```sql
    \c explore
    ```

### Create a table and data

Let's create a table of integers and populate it with some random values.

1. Create a table:
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE quicktest ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, value INT ); 
      ```

1. Populate the table:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO quicktest (value) SELECT random()*10000
    FROM generate_series(1,10000);
    ```

### Run some queries

1. Get a sum of the value column (for checking):
    ```sql
    select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
    ```
1. Get the average value:
    ```sql
    select AVG(value) from quicktest;
    ```
1. Get the maximum value:
    ```sql
    select MAX(value) from quicktest;
    ```
1. Get the minimum value:
    ```sql
    select MIN(value) from quicktest;
    ```
1. Get the standard deviation of the values:
    ```sql
    select STDDEV(value) from quicktest;
    ```
1. Get the ten lowest values in the table:
    ```sql
    select * from quicktest order by value limit 10;
    ```
1. Get the ten highest values in the table:
    ```sql
    select * from quicktest order by value desc limit 10;
    ```
