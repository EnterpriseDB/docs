title: Quickstart for EDB Postgres AI Console and Cloud Service
navTitle: Quickstart
---

This quickstart guide will take you through the steps to get started with the EDB Postgres AI Console and Cloud Service. You'll learn how to create an account on EDB Postgres AI, then use that account to create a single node database cluster on the Cloud Service. Finally, you'll learn how to connect to your new database cluster. 

## Getting your EDB Postgres AI account.

You need to have an account with EDB Postgres AI service. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for one at [https://www.enterprisedb.com/accounts/register/biganimal](https://www.enterprisedb.com/accounts/register/biganimal).

Once you have your account, you can access the Console by navigating to [https://portal.biganimal.com](https://portal.biganimal.com) and logging in with your EDB Postgres AI  credentials.

## The single pane of glass view

Once logged into your EDB account, you’ll be able taken to the EDB Postgres AI Console.

The Console opens by default on the overview page for your account and the “single pane of glass” for all your EDB Postgres AI services. You can get to this overview page by selecting the EDB logo in the top right-hand corner.

In the top left-hand corner, you can see the currently logged in user name and your organization name. Every user of EDB Postgres AI is the owner of their own organization. This is the avatar menu. You can select this to see the options to log out, change your password, or view your account details.

Below all of this is the **Projects** and **Estate** views. The **Projects** view will already have one generated project for you. Every user of EDB Postgres AI has at one default project created for them in their organization. In our example the default project is called "Generous Panda". Select that name in the list to view the project.

## The project view

The project view is where you can create and manage resources. Each project is a collection of resources that relate to each other in some way.

![Quickstart Project view](images/qs_project_view.png)

When there's no resources in the project, you'll see a message prompting you to create a resource using a **Create New** button. We're not going to use that button right now, as we're going to create our resource from the **Clusters** view. Select **Clusters** in the left-hand menu to view the clusters in the project.

## The clusters view

The clusters view is where you can create and manage database clusters and similar resources. In Postgres terminology, a database cluster is a collection of databases that exist together. This view shows you all the clusters in the project, and includes a filter so you can search for a specific cluster.

![Quickstart Clusters view](images/qs_clusters_view.png)

When there are no clusters in the project, you'll see a message prompting you to create a cluster using a **Create New** button. Select that button to create a new cluster. Currently, you can choose from a database cluster or a lakehouse analytics cluster. We're going to create a database cluster, so select that option.

## Creating a database cluster

When you select to create a database cluster, you'll be taken to the **Create Cluster** page. As we were already in a Project's Cluster view, that's the project the new cluster will be created in.  

![Quickstart Create Cluster](images/qs_create_cluster.png)

You now have the choice of what type of database cluster you want to create. You can choose between a single node or a multi-node cluster. We're going to create a single node cluster, so select that option.

Next, you need to choose whether you want the cluster to be hosted and billed by EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service, or if you want to host the infrastructure yourself in your own cloud account, while retaining the benefits of EDB Postgres AI management and monitoring of the cluster. Hosting with Cloud Service is quick and doesn't require any setup on your part, so that is the option to choose for this quickstart.

The next step is choosing the cloud provider and region you want to use. You can choose from AWS, Azure, or GCP; EDB's Hosted Cloud Service supports them all. Choose AWS for this exercise and the whichever region you prefer.

At the bottom on the page is a button marked **Next: Cluster Settings**. Select that to move to the next step. Do not press the **Create Cluster** button yet; if you do you'll create the cluster with the default name `Cluster0`. The next page allows you to customize the cluster settings, including the cluster name.

![Quickstart Create Cluster - Cluster Settings](images/qs_create_cluster_cluster_settings.png)

Give the cluster a name in the top field marked **Cluster Name**. We're going to call ours `Demo Cluster`.

The next field is **Password** and is already filled in with a generated password. It is essential that you copy this password to a safe place or enter a password that you know. You'll need this password to connect to the database cluster later.

Below the password field is a **Tags** field. Tags are a way to label your resources so you can find them later. You can add tags to your cluster if you want, but it's not required.

Below that's the **Database Type** section with a selector for which kind of Postgres database your want; plain Postgres, EDB's Postgres Extended or EDB's Postgres Advanced (with optional Oracle compatibility). We're going to use plain Postgres for this quickstart.

Progressing further down the page are settings for instance type for the machine which will be running the database, storage size and performance, network logs and allowlists. You can leave all of these at their default settings for this quickstart.

Now you can press the **Create Cluster** button. Cloud Service is now provisioning the cluster and you'll automatically go to the Project's **Clusters** view to watch its progress. It can take anything from a few minutes to 15 minutes to create the cluster, depending on the database type, cloud provider and region you chose.

## Connecting to the database cluster

When the cluster is ready, you'll see it in the **Clusters** view. Select the cluster name to view the cluster details.
