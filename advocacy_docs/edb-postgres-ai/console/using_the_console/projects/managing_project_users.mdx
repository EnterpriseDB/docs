## Adding a user to a project

Before adding a user to a project: 
- The user must be a member of the project's organization.

- If the user isn't currently a member of the project's organization:
  - an organization owner can invite them to join the organization or add them to the organization through the organization's identity provider. See [managing user access](../organizations/users) for more information.
  - a project owner can invite them to join the project.
- The user must then log in to the EDB Postgres AI portal at least once.

- If the user is invited to join from the project users, the user will receive an email invitation to join the project. The user must accept the invitation to join the project.

If the user is not a member of the organization, you will need to invite the user to the project: 

1. From the **Projects** view, select the project you invite to add a user to.
2. From the left navigation bar, select **Users**.
3. Select **Invite New User**.
4. Enter the user's email address.
5. Select the role or roles you want to assign to the user. (owner, viewer, or editor)
6. Select **Send Invite**.

If the user is already a member of the organization, to add the user to the project: 

1. From the **Projects** view, select the project you want to add a user to.
2.  From the left navigation bar, select **Users**.
3.  Select the edit icon for the user. This will display the roles currently assigned to the used.
4.  Select **Assign Roles**.
5.  Depending on the level of access you want for the user, select the appropriate role.
6.  Select **Submit**.

You can enable in-app inbox or email notifications to get alerted when a user is invited to a project. For more information, see [Notifications](notifications)
