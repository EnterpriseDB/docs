There are a number of ways to view and manage projects within the EDB Postgres AI

## Project creation and management

### Creating a new project

All accounts have a default project created for them.

You can create new projects in the single pane of glass view of projects and in the Projects tab. Both views have a **Create New Project** button.

Select the button and you go to a new page where you can enter a project name and add tags to the project. Tags are optional. Enter a name and click **Create New Project** to create a new empty project which is owned by your user.

### Renaming a project

You can rename a project in the single pane of glass view of projects and in the Projects tab. To rename a project, locate the project you wish to rename and select the ellipsis menu button on the right-hand side of the project name. Select **Edit** from the menu that appears. On the page that then appears, enter the new name and click **Update Project**.

### Deleting a project

You can delete a project in the single pane of glass view of projects and in the Projects tab. To delete a project, locate the project you wish to delete and select the ellipsis menu button on the right-hand side of the project name. Select **Delete** from the menu that appears. On the page that then appears, click **Yes, Delete Project**. You must delete all clusters in the project before you can delete the project.

!!!Note 
Contact [EDB Postgres AI Support](/biganimal/release/overview/support) if you want to delete the initial automatically created default project. This project cannot be deleted through the console interface.

## Viewing projects

### Projects in the single pane of glass view

The single pane view of projects shows the top three active projects in your organization. 
To see more projects, click **View All Projects** (which opens the [Projects tab](#projects-in-the-projects-tab)).
To see the detailed [Project view](#projects-in-the-project-view), select the project name.

In this view, you can see the project name, the number of resources in the project, the number of users with roles in the project, and, if set, and tags associated with that project. 
There is also the option to add tags to a project. 
On the right-hand side of each entry is an ellipsis menu button. Selecting this button opens a menu with the options available to the current user for that project.

#### Project Name

The top menu item displays the current project name. Selecting it displays a sub-menu listing other projects in the organization, allowing you to switch between projects. The sub-menu also includes the option to create a new project and to view all projects by switching to the [Projects tab](#projects-in-the-projects-tab).

#### Overview

The overview page is the default view when selecting a project. It shows your name, the project name, the number of resources in the project, and the status of the top three resources in the project.

<img src="images/projectoverviewcluster.png" style="border:1px solid; margin: 5px auto 5px"/>

For each project, in the default view, you are able to see a description of the cluster and the cloud service provider and region it's running on. Below that's a selection of metrics for the cluster including, memory usage, CPU usage, storage usage, disk IOPS and transaction rate and the database size.

To the right of the cluster's information is an ellipsis menu button, which when selected offers the following options:

| Option                 | Description                                              |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Credential Information | Show the credentials and URLs for accessing this cluster |
| Edit Cluster           | Edit the cluster details and configuration               |

**Edit Cluster** takes you to the appropriate page to edit the cluster details, depending on the type of cluster&mdash;database or lakehouse. The page you go to is similar to the Create page used to create that type of cluster.

#### Clusters

Displays all the clusters in the project in a table format. The clusters view shows the cluster name, creation time (or for a paused cluster, when it was paused and when it will resume), the Postgres version, the cloud service provider, the region, the type of cluster, the provisioned instance type and provisioned storage. 

To the right of the cluster's information is are a lock icon, a pen icon and an ellipsis menu button. The lock shows the credential information for the cluster, the pen icon takes you to the appropriate edit cluster page, and the ellipsis menu button which when selected provides the following options:

| Option               | Description                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Create Replica       | Create a faraway replica of the selected cluster |
| Change Password      | Change the password for the selected cluster     |
| Pause/Resume Cluster | Pauses or Resumes the selected cluster           |
| Delete Cluster       | Deletes the selected cluster                     |

#### Storage Locations

Displays all the storage locations in the project in a table format. Storage locations, also known as Managed Storage Locations, are data repositories for EDB Postgres AI Analytics. You sync and migrate data to these locations for analysis from Postgres databases or S3 storage. The data is then optimized for fast query, aggregation, and analysis. 

##TODO: Add more information about storage locations

#### Regions

Displays all the regions available to the the project in a table format. The regions view shows the region name, tags, current number of clusters in the region, the cloud service provider, the region, the region status, the deployment (Cloud Service hosted or your own account) the provisioned storage and whether the region is active or not.

All regions are active for Cloud Service hosted clusters. For your own account clusters, you can activate or deactivate regions on demand.

#### Users

Displays all the users in the organisation in a table. Each users full name, email, project roles, identity provider, and on the right hand side, a pen icon. Selecting the pen icon on a user will allow you to assign or remove roles from that user. 

By default, all users are shown. You can filter the users by name using the search bar at the top of the table or by role using the dropdown menu labelled **Filter** for Project Roles. The sort order of the list can also be controlled by the sort dropdown menu next to the filter allowing for sorting by name or email.

Adding a new user to the project is done by selecting the **Invite New User** button at the top of the table. This opens a dialog where you can enter the email address of the user you wish to invite and assign them a role. The role can be selected from the dropdown menu in the dialog. Outstanding invitations can be viewed in the **Invitations** tab, where invitations can be resent, created as a link or deleted.

#### Cloud Providers

Displays all the cloud providers configured in the project. By default, the Cloud Service hosting providers (Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure and AWS) are enabled, connected and displayed under the EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service tab. Selecting the other **Your Cloud Account** tab will display any cloud providers you have added and connected to your EDB Postgres AI project. Also shown on this tab are instructions on how to connect a new cloud provider.

#### Usage Report

Displays the usage report for the project. Each cluster is listed along with its type, deployment option, cloud provider, infrastructure units and vCPU units used over a time period. At the top of the table is a filter bar allowing you to focus on particular database types, particular cloud providers or particular deployment options. There are also options to control the sort order of the table and to download the usage report as a CSV file.
