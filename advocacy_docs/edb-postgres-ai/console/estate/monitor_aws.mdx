## Overview 

The procedure for setting up EDB PostgresÂ® AI Console to monitor your RDS instances and S3 buckets on AWS requires policy and role additions in AWS. It then requires you to enter the role ARN of the newly created role into the Cloud Hosted Databases wizard, accessible using the Estate page in the EDB Postgres AI console.

All RDS instances and S3 buckets that are not excluded by location

## Procedure

### Logging in and starting the Cloud Hosted Databases wizard

1. Log into **EDB Postgres AI Console**. 

2. Scroll down to the **Cloud Hosted Databases** section, select the **Manage Access** button, and choose your project.

3. The **Cloud Hosted Databases** wizard shows "Step 1 - Create custom policy"

### Creating AWS custom policy

4. Log into your AWS account with the RDS instances and S3 buckets you want to monitor.

5. Navigate to IAM and in the navigation pane on the left side of the AWS console, select **Policies**.

6. On the **Policies dashboard** page, select the **Create policy**. button

7. In the **Policy editor** section, choose the JSON option.

8. Type or paste the following JSON policy document into the JSON editor:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
        "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
        "rds:DescribeDBClusters"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

9. Give the policy a name, for instance, **biganimal-beacon-addon-policy**. This policy allows EDB Postgres AI server to query metadata of your AWS RDS and S3 services.


### Creating a role

10. In the left-hand navigation pane of the AWS console, choose **Roles** and then select the **Create role** button.

11. Select **Custom trust policy** role type.

12. In the Custom trust policy section, paste the following trust policy for the role:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::292478331082:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:ExternalId": "<project-id>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

13. Select the **Next** button.

14. Select the policy you created earlier. In this example, we used **biganimal-beacon-addon-policy**.

15. Select the **Next** button.

16. Give the role a name. Note that you must give the role a name that starts with **biganimal-role-<prefix>**, such as **biganimal-role-beacon**. 

17.
