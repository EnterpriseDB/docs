## Overview 

Setting up the EDB Postgres® AI Console to monitor your RDS instances and S3 buckets on AWS involves adding a specific policiy and role in AWS. Once these are configured, you need to enter the role ARN of the newly created role into the **Cloud Hosted Databases** UI, accessible via the **Estate** page in the EDB Postgres AI Console. 

Using this role ARN and a custom policy, the EDB Postgres AI server will have access to the RDS and S3 information in your AWS account. 

After providing the role ARN in the Cloud Hosted Databases UI, you will see the selected AWS resources (RDS instances and/or S3 buckets) in the chosen AWS regions on your **Estate** page in the **Cloud Hosted Databases** section.

## Setting up monitoring of AWS resources in EDB Postgres AI Estate

### Starting the Cloud Hosted Databases UI

1. Go to **EDB Postgres AI Console**. 

2. Scroll down to the **Cloud Hosted Databases** section, select the **Manage Access** button, and choose your project.

3. The **Cloud Hosted Databases** UI shows **Step 1 - Create custom policy**.

### Creating the AWS custom policy

4. Go to the console of your AWS account with the RDS instances and S3 buckets you want to monitor.

5. Navigate to IAM, and in the navigation pane on the left side of the AWS console, select **Policies**.

6. On the **Policies** dashboard page, select the **Create policy**. button

7. In the **Policy editor** section, choose the JSON option.

8. Type or paste the following JSON policy document into the JSON editor:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "rds:DescribeDBInstances",
        "s3:ListAllMyBuckets",
        "rds:DescribeDBClusters"
      ],
      "Resource": "*"
    }
  ]
}
```

9. Give the policy a name, for example, `edb-postgres-ai-addon-policy`. This policy allows EDB Postgres AI server to query metadata of your AWS RDS and S3 services.


### Creating the AWS role

10. Next, in the Cloud Hosted Databases UI, select the **Next:Create a Role** button. The Cloud Hosted Databases UI should now show **Step 2 - Create a Role**.

11. Now, in the left-hand navigation pane of the AWS console UI, choose **Roles** and then select the **Create role** button.

12. Select **Custom trust policy** role type.

13. In the **Custom trust policy** section, paste the following trust policy for the role:

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::292478331082:root"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
      "Condition": {
        "StringEquals": {
          "sts:ExternalId": "<project-id>"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

!!! Note
The EDB Postgres AI Cloud Hosted Databases UI shows a snippet like the one above but with the `<project-id>` already specified.
!!!

14. Select the **Next** button.

15. Select the policy you created earlier. In this example, we used `edb-postgres-ai-addon-policy`.

16. Select the **Next** button.

17. Give the role a name. Note that you must give the role a name that starts with `biganimal-role`, such as `biganimal-role-beacon`. 

18. Select the **Create role** button.

### Entering the role ARN into the EDB Postgres AI UI

19. Still in the AWS console, select the **View role** button in the green banner at the top of the **Roles** dashboard in the AWS console.

20. Copy the role ARN from the Summary section of the Role page in AWS console and paste it into the form at the bottom of the Cloud Hosted Databases UI labeled **Role ARN**.

21. Select the **Next: Regions and Services** button in the Cloud Hosted Databases UI to move to the next step.

### Selecting the scope of regions and services

22. For **Step 3 - Regions and Services**, select the regions that you want to monitor and the services you want to monitor in those regions.

23. Select the **Next: Review and submit** button.

24. Review your regions and services selections, and then select the **Submit** button. If you notice a mistake, you can always use the **Prev: Regions and Services** button and go back a step.

25. Upon success, you will see a notification in the console UI saying, "The configuration has been submitted successfully."

26. Within a moment, you should start to see the **Cloud Hosted Databases** section of your **Estate** page populate with the available S3 buckets and RDS instances.
