navTitle: Metrics Ingestion
description: The metrics that can be ingested into the EDB Postgres AI control plane and your Estate.
---

All agents in the EDB Postgres AI Estate send metrics to the EDB Postgres AI control plane.

Currently ingestion brings in the following metrics into the Estate:

* Database size - derived from pg_database_size() and presented in MiB.
* Recovery status - derived from pg_is_in_recovery().
* Postgres version - derived from version().
* Host name[^1] - derived from `gopsutil.Hostname()`
* Operating system[^1] - derived from `gopsutil.OS()` for example "linux".
* Platform[^1] - derived from `gopsutil.Platform()`, for example "ubuntu".
* Platform version[^1] - derived from `gopsutil.PlatformVersion()`, for example "20.04".
* CPU count[^1] - derived from `gopsutil.CPUs.Counts()`.

[^1] The agent acquires these metrics from the host where the agent is running and aren't currently collected from the database itself. They're also not currently displayed in the EDB Postgres AI Console.

The metrics ingestion process is secure and doesn't collect any data from the tables themselves.
