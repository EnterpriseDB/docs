Setting up the EDB Postgres® AI Console to monitor your RDS instances and S3 buckets on AWS involves adding a specific policy and role in AWS. Once the policy and role are in place, you need to enter the role ARN of the newly created role into the **Cloud Hosted Databases** UI, accessible via the **Estate** page in the EDB Postgres AI Console. 

Using this role ARN and a custom policy, the EDB Postgres AI server can access to the RDS and S3 information in your AWS account. 

After providing the role ARN in the Cloud Hosted Databases UI, you can see the selected AWS resources (RDS instances and/or S3 buckets) in the chosen AWS regions on your **Estate** page in the **Cloud Hosted Databases** section.
