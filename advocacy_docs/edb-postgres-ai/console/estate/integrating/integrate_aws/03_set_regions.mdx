The final step after setting up a policy and [creating a role](02_create_role) in AWS is to set the regions and services you want to monitor in your AWS account. In the Cloud Hosted Databases UI, you should be seeing the **Step 3 - Regions and Services** page.

1. On the page, select the regions that you want to monitor.

2. Below the regions, select the services you want to monitor in those regions.

3. Select the **Next: Review and submit** button.

4. Review your regions and services selections, then select the **Submit** button. If you notice a mistake, you can always use the **Prev: Regions and Services** button and go back a step.

5. Upon success, you will see a notification at the top of the Estate page saying, "The configuration has been submitted successfully."

6. You should start to see the **Cloud Hosted Databases** section of your **Estate** page populate with the available S3 buckets and RDS instances.
