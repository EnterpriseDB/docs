Following on from [Creating a policy](01_create_policy), you now need to create a role in AWS that uses that policy. You then need to inform EDB Postgres AI of the role ARN so that it can access the RDS and S3 metadata in your AWS account.

1. Go to the AWS console UI, and in the left-hand navigation pane, choose **Roles** and then select the **Create role** button.

2. Select **Custom trust policy** role type.

3. In the **Custom trust policy** section, paste the trust policy you obtained from **Step 2** in the Cloud Hosted Databases UI. It looks similar to this:

    ```json
    {
      "Version": "2012-10-17",
      "Statement": [
        {
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::292478331082:root"
          },
          "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
          "Condition": {
            "StringEquals": {
              "sts:ExternalId": "<project-id>"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

  !!! Note
  The EDB Postgres AI Cloud Hosted Databases UI shows a snippet like the one above but with the `<project-id>` already specified.
  !!!

4. Select the **Next** button.

5. Select the policy you created earlier. In this example, we used `edb-postgres-ai-addon-policy`.

6. Select the **Next** button.

7. Give the role a name. Note that you must give the role a name that starts with `biganimal-role`, such as `biganimal-role-beacon`. 

8. Select the **Create role** button.

9. Still in the AWS console, select the **View role** button in the green banner at the top of the **Roles** dashboard in the AWS console.

10. Copy the role ARN from the Summary section of the Role page in AWS console and paste it into the form at the bottom of the Cloud Hosted Databases UI labeled **Role ARN**.

11. Select the **Next: Regions and Services** button in the Cloud Hosted Databases UI to move to [**Step-3: Regions and Services**](03_set_regions).
