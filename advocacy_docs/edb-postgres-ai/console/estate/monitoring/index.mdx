To start monitoring resources in your Estate, go to the [EDB Postgres AI Console](https://portal.biganimal.com/beacon). 

Select a Project in the *Projects* panel.

This takes you to the Overview page for the selected Project. By default this displays the top three most recently active resources in the project, with statistics for Memory, CPU, Storage, and Disk IOPS usage along with Transactions rate and Database size.

To see all the Clusters in a Project, select the *Clusters* tab. This shows a list of all the Clusters in the Project. To view a Clusters detailed statistics, select the Cluster's name in the view. This takes you to the Cluster view. Select the *Monitoring* tab to see the detailed statistics for the Cluster.
