To monitor your self-managed Postgres database with Beacon Agent, you will need to:

*  [Create a machine user](create-machine-user) in the EDB PostgresÂ® AI Console. This provides an access key for the agent.
*  [Install Beacon Agent](install-agent) on the server where your Postgres instance is running. You will use the access key to enable the agent to communicate with the EDB Postgres AI Estate service.
*  [Run Beacon Agent as a service](agent-as-a-service) to have it start automatically on system startup and restart after errors.
