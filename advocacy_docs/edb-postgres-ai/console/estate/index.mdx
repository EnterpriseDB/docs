## About Estate

EDB PostgresÂ® AI manages and hosts many services for many users, gathering metrics, orchestrating services, and more. 

In EDB Postgres AI, the Estate is a term to refer to all the resources you have access to on EDB Postgres AI. Whatever resource you add, it becomes part of your Estate.

Within your Estate are Projects. Projects group your resources and services, allowing you to organize your Estate. You can create a project for each of your teams, each specific application or project, or each environment and you can control access to each project. When you add a resource to your Estate, you can choose which project it belongs to.
