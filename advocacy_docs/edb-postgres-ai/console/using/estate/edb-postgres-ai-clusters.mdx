## Clusters view in the single pane of glass

In the single pane of glass view, this view shows a color coded snapshot of the clusters, along with a textual description of which cloud service providers are in use and how many are Cloud Service Hosted by EDB or Managed but not hosted by EDB.

Selecting **View Estate** takes you to the full estate view.

## Full Clusters view

In the full clusters view, you can see all the clusters in your Estate. The view is similar to the project view but includes an additional **Project** column to show which project the cluster belongs to. You can select a cluster's project to go directly to the project view.

Selecting a clusters name will bring up a cluster details view that shows:
* Cluster name
* Performance metrics including memory, CPU, storage, tranasaction rate and database size
* An overview of the cluster's configuration including:
  * Cluster type
  * Number of nodes
  * Deployment type
  * Cloud service provider
  * Region
  * Postgres type and version
  * Provisioned instance type and size
  * Provisioned storage volume type and properties
  * Backup retention policy
* A psql command to connect to the cluster

Clusters with a green circle are running, those with a red circle are paused and those with a blue circle are recently deleted.

Running clusters have an ellipsis menu button that when selected provides the following options:

| Option                                       | Description                                      |

## Creating a new cluster

The **Create New** button allows you to create a new Database cluster or Lakehouse analytics cluster in any of your projects. First, select between creating a Database cluster or a  Lakehouse analytics node. 

If you only have one project, the creation operation automatically uses it. If you have more than one project, a menu of available projects to create your cluster in pops-up for you to select which project the cluster should appear in.

After selecting the project you are taken to the Cloud Service's [Create Cluster](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/creating_cluster/) page where you can configure the cluster.
