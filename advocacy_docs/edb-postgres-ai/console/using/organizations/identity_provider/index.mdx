After signing in for the first time with your EDB account, you can either use the EDB Postgres AI platform as your identity provider or set up your own. 

!!!Note

If you purchased through Azure Marketplace, EDB Postgres AI authenticates users using Azure Active Directory (AD) and you don't have to complete these steps. Azure AD is linked during subscription. Also, you can still invite users that have an EDB account through the EDB Postgres AI portal. 

See [Setting up your Azure Marketplace account](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/getting_started/your_cloud_account/azure_market_setup/).
!!!

When using your own identity provider, you add users to EDB Postgres AI by adding them to the designated group in your identity provider. Once you've logged into EDB Postgres AI using your own identity provider, you can set up your cloud service provider in the EDB Postgres AI portal to complete onboarding. 

If you're using the EDB Postgres AI platform as your identity provider, you can also invite users that have an EDB account by selecting **Invite New User** on the Users page. After providing their EDB account email and their role, you can send them an invitation link. Ensure the user accepts the invitation within 48 hours, or you'll have to send a new invitation. 

For more information on roles, see [Managing portal access](/edb-postgres-ai/console/using/organizations/users/).

## Setting up your own identity provider

EDB Postgres AI supports single sign-on through SAML identity providers. The SAML application enables access to EDB Postgres AI for groups selected in your identity provider. You configure your SAML application to send a SAML assertion response to EDB Postgres AI for each user.

The identity provider application provides:

-   Signature certificate
-   Single sign-on URL (Sign In Endpoint)

The EDB Postgres AI service provider provides:

-   ACS URL (Assertion Consumer Service)
-   SP Entity ID (Audience URI)

The Set Up Identity Provider page in EDB Postgres AI provides the ACS URL and Audience URI, which you can copy to use when configuring your SAML application. The page also includes information about mandatory attributes for the configuration.

You need the following SAML assertions to map the user information in your identity provider application to EDB Postgres AI:

```
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/nameidentifier
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/name
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/givenname
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/surname
http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims/emailaddress
```

### Configure SAML

On the Set Up Identity Provider page:

1.  In the **Connection Info** section, copy the following URLs to use in your identity provider configuration:  

    | URL                            | Description                                                                                |
    | ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
    | Assertion Consumer Service URL | EDB Postgres AI-specific URL to which SAML assertions from your identity provider are sent |
    | Audience URI                   | The entity or audience for which the SAML assertion is intended                            |
2.  In the **Configure SAML response** section, configure your identity provider to send the SAML response. The SAML response must include the following attributes:

    -   `givenname` — EDB Postgres AI uses the value as the given name in the profile of the authenticated user.
    -   `surname` — EDB Postgres AI uses the value as the surname in the profile of the authenticated user.
    -   `name` — EDB Postgres AI uses the value as the full name (`givenname` joined with `surname`) in the profile of the authenticated user.
    -   `emailaddress` — EDB Postgres AI uses the value for the email address in the profile of the authenticated user. 

    Provide a `NameID` element in the `Subject` element. Provide your email ID as the value to `NameID`. EDB Postgres AI uses the email ID you provide as your username and primary email, so format `NameID` like an email address.

    For example:

    ![](../images/nameID.png)
3.  In the **SAML settings** section, enter the configuration information for your preferred SAML identity provider:

    | Field                                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
    | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | Single Sign-On URL                           | The identity provider's sign-on URL.                                                                                                                                        |
    | Identity Provider Signature Certificate      | Identity provider's assertion signing certificate (`.cer` or `.cert`). Coordinate with your identity provider partner to obtain this certificate securely.                  |
    | Request Binding                              | SAML Authentication Request Protocol binding used to send the authentication request: HTTP-Redirect,  HTTP-Post, or Hybrid (SAML request is REDIRECT and response is POST). |
    | Response Signature Algorithm (RSA) Algorithm | The signature algorithm used to sign the SAML AuthNRequest (RSA SHA-1 or RSA SHA-256).                                                                                      |
4.  Select **Test Connection**. If you connect to your identity provider successfully, your identity provider's login screen appears. If an error message appears, contact [Support](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/support_services/).

Once your identity provider is set up, you can view your connection status, ID, login URL, audience URI, and assertion consumer service URL from the EDB Postgres AI console on the Identity Provider page. Select **Settings** from the drop down menu in the top right hand corder then select the **Identity Provider** tab to access it.

### Setting up specific identity providers

Step-by-step instructions for setting up specific identity providers are available in the EDB Postgres AI knowledge base. See:

### Add a domain

You need a verified domain so your users can have a streamlined login experience with their email address. 

1.  On the **Domains** tab, enter the domain name and select **Next: Verify Domain**. 

2.  To add it as a TXT record on that domain in your DNS provider's management console, copy the TXT record and follow the instructions in the on-screen verify box:

    1.  Log in to your domain registrar or web host account.
    2.  Navigate to the DNS settings for the domain you want to verify.
    3.  Add a TXT record.
    4.  In the **Name** field, enter `@`.
    5.  In the **Value** field, enter the verification string provided, for example, `edb-biganimal-verification=VjpcxtIC57DujkKMtECSwo67FyfCExku`.
    6.  Save your changes and wait for the DNS propagation period to complete. This can take up to 48 hours.

3.  Select **Done**. 

    Your domain and its status appear on the **Domains** tab, where you can delete or verify it. 
    Domains can take up to 48 hours for the change of the domain record by the DNS provider to propagate before you can verify it. 

4.  If your domain hasn't verified after a day, you can debug whether your domain has the matching verification text field. 
    o check the exact value of the required TXT field, select **Verify** next to the domain at `/settings/domains`.
    Query your domain directly with DNS tools, such as nslookup, to check if you have an exact match for a text = "verification" field.
    Domains can have many TXT fields. As long as one matches, it should verify.

```
> nslookup -type=TXT mydomain.com

;; Truncated, retrying in TCP mode.
Server:		192.168.1.1
Address:	192.168.1.1#53
Non-authoritative answer:
...
mydomain.com	text = “edb-biganimal-verification=VjpcxtIC57DujkKMtECSwo67FyfCExku”
```

To add another domain, select **Add Domain**. 

When you have at least one verified domain (with **Status = Verified**, in green), the identity provider status becomes **Active** on the **Identity Providers** tab. 
When the domain is no longer verified, the status becomes **Inactive**. 

!!! Note

    Your DNS provider can take up to 48 hours to update. Once the domain is verified, the identity provider status can take up to three minutes to update.

### Domain expiry

The EDB system has a 10-day expiry set for checking whether domains are verified.

You buy domains from DNS providers by way of a leasing system. If the lease expires, you no longer own the domain, and it disappears from the Internet.
If this happens, you need to renew your domain with your DNS provider.

Whether the domain failed to verify within the 10 days or it expired months later,
it appears as **Status = Expired** (in red).
You can't reinstate an expired domain
because expiry means you might no longer own the domain. You need to verify it again.

-   To delete the domain, select the bin icon.
-   To re-create the domain, select **Add Domain**. Set a new verification key for the domain and update the TXT record for it in your DNS provider's management console, as described in [Add a doman](#add-a-domain).

### Manage roles for added users

You add users through your identity provider. A user who you add in the identity provider is automatically added to EDB Postgres AI. EDB Postgres AI assigns them with the default role of organization member. You manage roles and permissions from EDB Postgres AI. See [Managing portal access](/edb-postgres-ai/console/using/organizations/users/).

!!! Note

    A user is created in EDB Postgres AI only after they log in. After they log in, you can change their EDB Postgres AI role.

### Add a tile

Once you establish the identity provider, you can create a EDB Postgres AI tile for users to access the organization's EDB Postgres AI application. To do so, copy the quick sign-in URL from the **Settings > Identity Provider** page of the EDB Postgres AI portal. For details on how to add a tile, refer to your identify provider documentation for instructions on setting up SSO access to your application.

## Next steps
