EDB Postgres AI uses role-based access controls to grant users access to different parts of the application using organization-level and project-level roles. Roles are sets of permissions. 
EDB Postgres AI uses roles to manage permissions assigned to users.

* Each customer has a unique EDB Postgres AI organization. 
* Each organization has at least one project by default. 
* An organization's database clusters deploy on the cloud service providers within a project. 
* You can create multiple projects within a single organization.

With multiple projects within an organization you can: 
- Separate workflows to provide secure and isolated environments. 
- Assign different users to different projects or give different roles to users in different projects to ensure they have the correct level of permissions.

## Inviting or adding users to an organization

To access an EDB Postgres AI organization, each user needs to either have an EDB account that includes the user in EDB's own identity provider service, or the user needs to listed in the organization's identity provider. Identity providers establish the identity of users that can log in to EDB Postgres AI. 

All EDB Postgres AI organizations have a default identity provider based around EDB accounts. 
A user can sign up for an EDB account allowing the owner or administrator of an organization to add them to the organization.

You can configure other identity providers for your organization. For more information on how to do that, see [Setting up your identity provider](/identity_provider/).

You can invite people to your organization by selecting **User Management** from the dropdown menu in the top right of your EDB Postgres AI console page. This takes you to the **Users Management** view. In the top right hand side of the display is a **Add New User** button. Select that and in the **Add New User** dialog that appears, you can enter the users email address and assign organization level roles to the user. If you do not select any roles, the user will be added to the organization, but will need to be assigned project-level roles later to work on any project. Click **Send Invite** to send the invitation to the user.

### Organization-level roles

The following roles grant privileges within an organization.

- **Organization owner** &mdash; This role has management privileges to the organization and can perform the following actions:

## Inviting or adding users to a project

In the dialog that appears, you can enter the users email address and you can assign roles to them for that project only. Once you have selected at least one role for the user, select **Send Invite** and the invitation will be sent to the user. They'll need to create an EDB account if they don't have one already.
