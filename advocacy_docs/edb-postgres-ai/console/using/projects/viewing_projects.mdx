There are a range of ways to view a project or projects within the EDB Postgres AI

### Projects in the single pane of glass view

The single pane view of projects shows the top three active projects in your organization. 
To see more projects, click **View All Projects** (which opens the [Projects tab](#projects-in-the-projects-tab)).
To see the detailed [Project view](#projects-in-the-project-view), select the project name.

In this view, you can see the project name, the number of resources in the project, the number of users with roles in the project, and, if set, and tags associated with that project. 
There is also the option to add tags to a project. 
On the right-hand side of each entry is an ellipsis menu button. Selecting this button opens a menu with the options available to the current user for that project.
