Projects are how EDB Postgres AI enables an organisation to manage and segregate resources. A project is a grouping of EDB Postgres AI resources such as database clusters, analytics clusters, and AI/ML services, within an EDB Postgres AI organization.

Members of an organization don't, automatically, get access to a project. That only happens if a user with sufficient permissions to do so, such as an organization owner or project owner, assigns a role to a user.

Projects also provide an overview of the resources within the project, including the status of the resources and the ability to manage the resources.

* [Viewing Projects](viewing_projects) shows how to view the projects in your organization, how to drill down to the resources within a project, and what actions are available to you.
