Projects are how EDB Postgres AI enables an organisation to manage and segregate resources. A project is a grouping of EDB Postgres AI resources &mdash; database clusters, analytics clusters, AI/ML services &mdash; within an EDB Postgres AI organization.

Members of an organization don't, automatically, get access to a project. That only happens if a user with sufficient permissions to do so, such as an organization owner or project owner, assigns a role to a user.

Projects also provide an overview of the resources within the project, including the status of the resources and the ability to manage the resources.

* [Viewing and Managing Projects](viewing_managing_projects) shows how to view the projects in your organization, how to drill down to the resources within a project, and what information is available to you.

* [Managing Project Users](managing_project_users) covers how to add users to a project and assign roles to control access to projects.

* [Managing Project TDE keys](managing_project_tde) explains how you can enable a project's ability to manage TDE (Transparent Data Encryption) keys in the cloud.
