The **Users** page displays all the users in the organisation in a table. Each users full name, email, project roles, identity provider, and on the right hand side, a pen icon. Selecting the pen icon on a user allows you to assign or remove roles from that user. 

By default, the table shows all users in the organisation. You can filter the users by name using the search bar at the top of the table or by role using the dropdown menu labelled **Filter** for Project Roles. The sort drop down menu next to the filter controls the sort order of the list allowing for sorting by name or email.

## Inviting or adding users to a project

You can invite people to a project by selecting **Invite New User** on the Users page in the EDB Postgres AI console. In the dialog that appears, you can enter the users email address and you can assign roles to them for that project only. Once you have selected at least one role for the user, select **Send Invite** and send the invitation to the user. They'll need to create an EDB account if they don't have one already.

## Adding a user to a project

Before adding a user to a project:

  - an organization owner can invite them to join the organization or add them to the organization through the organization's identity provider. See [managing user access](../organizations/users) for more information.
  - a project owner can invite them to join the project.
- The user must then log in to the EDB Postgres AI portal at least once.

- Inviting a user to join from the project's Users page means that the user receives an email invitation to join the project. The user must accept the invitation to join the project.

If the user isn't a member of the organization, you need to invite the user to the project: 

1. From the **Projects** view, select the project you invite to add a user to.
