description: How to manage regions in an EDB Postgres AI project
---

Displays all the regions available to the project in a table format. The regions view shows the region name, tags, current number of clusters in the region, the cloud service provider, the region, the region status, whether the deployment is Cloud Service hosted or on your own account, the provisioned storage and whether the region is active or not.

You can use the search bar to search for a region by name. You can also filter the regions by cloud service provider and region status.

All regions are automatically active for EDB-hosted Cloud Service clusters. 

For your own account clusters, you can activate or deactivate regions as needed. Where a region is your own cloud account, there is a pause/resume button to the right of the region's information. This allows you to pause or resume the region. When you pause a region, all the clusters in the region stop and you aren't billed for the clusters in the region. When you resume a region, all the clusters in the region restart and billing for the clusters resumes.

There is also a trashcan icon to the right of the pause/resume button which allows you to delete the region. Deleting a region deletes all the clusters in the region. You must confirm the deletion before it takes place.
