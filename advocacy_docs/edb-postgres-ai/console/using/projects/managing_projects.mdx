There are a number of ways to view and manage projects within the EDB Postgres AI

## Project creation and management

### Creating a new project

All accounts have a default project created for them.

You can create new projects in the single pane of glass view of projects and in the Projects tab. Both views have a **Create New Project** button.

Select the button and you go to a new page where you can enter a project name and add tags to the project. Tags are optional. Enter a name and click **Create New Project** to create a new empty project that your user owns.

### Renaming a project

You can rename a project in the single pane of glass view of projects and in the **Projects** tab. To rename a project, locate the project you wish to rename and select the ellipsis menu button on the right-hand side of the project name. Select **Edit** from the menu that appears. On the page that then appears, enter the new name and click **Update Project**.

### Deleting a project

You can delete a project in the single pane of glass view of projects and in the Projects tab. To delete a project, locate the project you wish to delete and select the ellipsis menu button on the right-hand side of the project name. Select **Delete** from the menu that appears.

#### Confirming a project deletion

When you select **Delete**, a dialog appears asking you to confirm the deletion.

If there are any clusters in the project, you must delete them before you can delete the project. The display shows any remaining clusters with a checkbox against each. Select the checkbox for each cluster you wish to delete or click the **Select All** checkbox. Once you have selected the clusters you wish to delete, the system requires you to enter  "delete clusters" in the text box to confirm the deletion. This enables the **Delete All Clusters** button. Select **Delete All Clusters** to permanently delete all the selected clusters.

Once there are no clusters in the project, the dialog appears, listing the cluster name with a checkbox. Select the checkbox and enter "delete project" in the text field that appears. Entering the text enables the **Delete Project** button. Select **Delete Project** to completely delete the project. 

!!!Note 
Contact [EDB Postgres AI Support](/biganimal/release/overview/support) if you want to delete the initial automatically created default project. You can't delete the default project through the console interface.
