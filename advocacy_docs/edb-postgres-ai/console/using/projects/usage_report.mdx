The Usage Report page gives a view of the usage of the project's resources. Each cluster is listed along with its type, deployment option, cloud provider, infrastructure units and vCPU units used over a time period. At the top of the table is a filter bar allowing you to focus on particular database types, particular cloud providers or particular deployment options. There are also options to control the sort order of the table and to download the usage report as a CSV file.

You can display the Usage Report page by selecting the **Usage Report** option from the project's menus. This menu item is only available to users with the **Project owner** or **Project editor** roles.
