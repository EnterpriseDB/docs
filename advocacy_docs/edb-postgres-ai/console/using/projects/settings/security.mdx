description: Add and delete TDE keys for your project
---

The security settings page allows you to manage the security settings for your project. Specifically this enables you to add and delete TDE keys for your project.

!!! Note
TDE (Transparent Data Encryption) uses keys which must be securely stored in the cloud. This requires that you have configured your own cloud account and have the necessary permissions to manage keys in that account. EDB Postgres AI does not store the keys you use for TDE.
!!!

You can add and delete TDE keys for your project in the EDB Postgres AI console.

## Adding a TDE key

1. From the Projects page, select an existing project.
1. Go to **Settings** on the left-side navigation.
1. From the **Settings** list, select **Security**.
1. Select **Add a key**. 
1. On the **Add a key** page, select the **Cloud Service Provider**. 
1. Select the **Region** for the key. The interface only displays the regions available in the cloud account you configured.
1. Complete the remaining fields according to your cloud provider. 
1. Select **Add Key** to finalize the configuration.

!!! Note Note for GCP keys
If the key you added was created in a different Google Cloud Platform account than the TDE-enabled cluster you want to create, ensure you enable the [Cloud KMS API](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/create-encryption-keys#before-you-begin) in the Google console before assigning it to your cluster in EDB Postgres AI.
!!!

Now, use this TDE key to [create a cluster](/biganimal/release/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#security).

For more information about TDE support, see [Transparent Data Encryption](../overview/03_security#your-own-encryption-key---transparent-data-encryption-tde)

## Deleting a TDE key

1. Go to **Settings** on the left-side navigation.

1. From the **Settings** list, select **Security**.

   You're prompted to type **delete key name** in the field.
