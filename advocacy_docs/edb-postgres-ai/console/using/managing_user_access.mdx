EDB Postgres AI uses role-based access controls to grant users access to different parts of the application using organization-level and project-level roles. Roles are sets of permissions. 
EDB Postgres AI uses roles to manage permissions assigned to users.

* Each customer has a unique EDB Postgres AI organization. 
* Each organization has at least one project by default. 
* An organization's database clusters deploy on the cloud service providers within a project. 
* You can create multiple projects within a single organization.

With multiple projects within an organization you can: 
- Separate workflows to provide secure and isolated environments. 
- Assign different users to different projects or give different roles to users in different projects to ensure they have the correct level of permissions.

## Inviting or adding users to an organization

To access an EDB Postgres AI organization, each user needs to either have an EDB account that includes the user in EDB's own identity provider service, or the user needs to listed in the organization's identity provider. Identity providers establish the identity of users that can log in to EDB Postgres AI. 

All EDB Postgres AI organizations have a default identity provider based around EDB accounts. 
A user can sign up for an EDB account allowing the owner or administrator of an organization to add them to the organization.

You can configure other identity providers for your organization. For more information on how to do that, see [Setting up your identity provider](/identity_provider/).

You can invite people to your organization by selecting **User Management** from the dropdown menu in the top right of your EDB Postgres AI console page. This takes you to the **Users Management** view. In the top right hand side of the display is a **Add New User** button. Select that and in the **Add New User** dialog that appears, you can enter the users email address and assign organization level roles to the user. If you do not select any roles, the user will be added to the organization, but will need to be assigned project-level roles later to work on any project. Click **Send Invite** to send the invitation to the user.

### Organization-level roles

The following roles grant privileges within an organization.

- **Organization owner** &mdash; This role has management privileges to the organization and can perform the following actions:
  - Create and view projects within their organization
  - Update and delete their own projects
  - View and assign organization-level and project-level roles 
  - View an activity log for the whole organization and each project
  - View and download a usage report for the whole organization and each project
  - View the identity provider details

!!! Note
- The first user in a EDB Postgres AI organization is an organization owner and project owner of the initial project, by default. 
- At least one user must be an organization owner. 
!!!

- **Organization admin** &mdash; This role has read-only permissions to the organization. They can:
  - View a list of projects within the organization
  - View and download a usage report for the whole organization 
  - View other users with organization-level roles

## Inviting or adding users to a project

You can invite people to a project by selecting **Invite New User** on the Users page in the EDB Postgres AI console. In the dialog that appears, you can enter the users email address and you can assign roles to them for that project only. Once you have selected at least one role for the user, select **Send Invite** and the invitation will be sent to the user. They'll need to create an EDB account if they don't have one already.

### Project-level roles

The following roles grant privileges within a project:

- **Project owner** &mdash; This role has management privileges to the project and can perform the following actions within the project:

  - Connect the cloud service provider accounts to EDB Postgres AI 
  - View, edit, and delete the project
  - Create, view, edit, and delete clusters 
  - Activate, suspend, and deactivate regions 
  - View and assign project-level roles

## Users

Organization owners can assign users organization-level roles to complete certain tasks:

1.  From the menu next to your organization name in the top right of the portal, select **User Management**.

2.  Select the edit icon for the user.

3.  Select **Assign Roles**.

4.  Select the roles for the user.

5.  Select **Submit**.

See [Adding a user to a project](managing_projects#adding_a_user_to_a_project) for information on adding users to projects.

## Machine users

A machine user can drive programmatic access to EDB Postgres AI. 
This access can take place by way of user-customized automation scripts, EDB Postgres AI CLI commands, Terraform manifest, or EDB Postgres AI's first-party binaries that run from your environment.

- Any user with the organization's owner role can create, update, and delete a machine user.
- The organization owner can be a user authenticated by way of IDP or a machine user.
- An organization owner can manage the access key for the machine user but not for the normal user.
- The organization owner and project owner can assign and unassign the roles to any machine user in the same organization.
- EDB Postgres AI's authorization system performs permission checks on machine users as well as normal users.
- The machine user belongs to only one organization and can't switch to another organization.
- The machine user can't invite users, and the only way to authenticate and authorize a machine user is with an access key.

!!! note
There is quota limit for the number of machine users if you hit it and need more, please contact our support team.
!!!

### Adding a machine user

Only the organization owner can add a machine user.

To add a machine user:

1. From the menu next to your organization name in the top right of the portal, select **User Management**.
1. Select **Add New User**.
1. Select **Machine User** as the user type.
1. Provide the **Username**.
1. Optionally, provide the **Email ID**.
1. Optionally, select the **Create Access Key** check box. 
    - If you select the check box, an access key is created for this user.
    - If you don't select the check box, no access key is created while adding this user. You can create the access key for this user from the user's home page later.
1. Provide the **Access Key Name**.
1. Select the **Expires in (Day/s)** value for the access key.
1. To save the settings and provide the generated access key for the user, select **Add User**. 

Copy and this access key and save it in a secure location. The access key is available only when you create it. If you lose your access key, you must delete it and create a new one. For more information, see [Access key](../reference/access_key/).

Assign some organization role or project role to this newly created machine user. For more information, see [users](#users).

!!! note
The user management on EDB Postgres AI's UI at project level is used to assign the project role to the machine user, and not for managing the machine users and their access key.
