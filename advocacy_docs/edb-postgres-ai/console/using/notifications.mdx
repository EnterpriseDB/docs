With EDB Postgres AI, you can customize the types of notifications you want to receive. There are two types of notifications channels:

- User notifications channels - where you can receive notifications on email or in-app inbox or both.
- System notifications channels - where you can receive notifications on slack or webhook or pagerduty or all.

Different types of events are sent as notifications. Users with different roles can configure the preferences to receive these notifications.
The notifications are categorized into the following preference sections:
- **Account** - only for user notification channels 
- **Organizations** - for user and system notification channels both
- **Projects** - for user and system notification channels both

The notifications under the **Account** preference section are:

- New project role assigned to you
- Project role unassigned from you
- Personal access key is about to expire

The notifications under the **Organizations** preference section are:

- Payment method added (specific to organizations that opted for credit card payment option)
- Machine user API key is expiring

!!!note
This section is visible only to the organization owner. If the current user is owner of more than one organization, then this section lists the preferences for all the organizations.

The notifications under the **Projects** preference section are:

- Upcoming cluster maintenance upgrade

## Configuring notifications

The project owners/editors and organization owners/admins can enable/disable the notifications for the events visible to them. They can choose if they want to receive notifications in the in-app inbox, by email or both. 

Notification settings made by a user apply only to that user. If an email notification is enabled, the email is sent to the email address associated with the user's login.

System notification channels can be configured at Organization-level by organization owner or at Project-level by project owner. By default, the Organization-level system notifications channel are inherited by each project of that organization. However you can enable/disable or re-configure the system notifications channel at the Project-level to override the default settings.
