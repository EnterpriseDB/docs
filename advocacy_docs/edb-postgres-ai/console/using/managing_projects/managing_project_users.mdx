## Adding a user to a project

Before adding a user to a project: 
- The user must be added to the organization through the organization's identity provider.
- The user must log in to the BigAnimal portal at least once.
- You must be an organization owner or the project owner.

To add a user: 
1. From the **Projects** menu, select the project you want to add a user to.
1.  From the left navigation bar, select **Users**.
2.  Select the edit icon for the user.
3.  Select **Assign Roles**.
4.  Depending on the level of access you want for the user, select the appropriate role.
5.  Select **Submit**.

You can enable in-app inbox or email notifications to get alerted when a user is invited to a project. For more information, see [managing notifications](notifications/#manage-notifications).
