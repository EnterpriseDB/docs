Within an organization, you can create projects to provide additional security and segregation to workflows. 


## Organizations

An organization is a group of users that share access to the same set of resources.
Each organization has a unique set of resources and users.
As an EDB Postgres AI user, you already are the owner of your own organization.
Every user in EDB Postgres AI has their own organization. 
Every user in EDB Postgres AI can also be a member of one or more other organizations.

## Projects

Projects are a grouping of EDB Postgres AI resources &emdash; database clusters, analytics clusters, AI/ML services &emdash; within an EDB Postgres AI organization.
Being a member of an organization does not automatically grant access to all projects within that organization.
Access to projects is controlled by a user's role within that project. 
With projects, you can separate workflows to provide secure and isolated environments and assign different users to different projects.

## Users

Users are members of an organization and can be assigned roles within an organization or project.
A user can be given roles per organization (owner and admin) and per project.

## Machine users

Machine users are special users that can drive programmatic access to EDB Postgres AI.
