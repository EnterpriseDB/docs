---

EDB Postgres AI is, from a users point of view, split into two major components, organizations and projects. Organizations are made up of users and projects. Projects are made up of resources and services. An organization's users are given roles both within the organization and within projects which control what they can do.  

## Organizations

An organization is a group of users that share access to the same set of resources.
Each organization has a unique set of resources and users.
As an EDB Postgres AI user, you already are the owner of your own organization.
Every user in EDB Postgres AI has their own organization. 
Every user in EDB Postgres AI can also be a member of one or more other organizations.

## Projects

Projects are a grouping of EDB Postgres AI resources — database clusters, analytics clusters, AI/ML services — within an EDB Postgres AI organization.
Being a member of an organization doesn't automatically grant access to all projects within that organization.
A user's role within a project controls their access to that project. 
With projects, you can separate workflows to provide secure and isolated environments and assign different users to different projects.

## Users

A user is a person who has access to EDB Postgres AI. A new user has their own organization with a default project created within it. Creating new users can be by invitation, using a link or email, or through enabling a SAML-based identity provider.

The user can then receive invitations to become a member of an organization sent by the organization owner or by other users with the appropriate permissions. Upon accepting the invitation, the user becomes a member of the organization, in addition to their existing memberships. Owners and admins can assign roles to them within the organization and within projects. This includes becoming owner or admin of an organization or project.

## Machine users

Machine users are special users that can drive programmatic access to EDB Postgres AI. They can be created by an organization owner and can be assigned roles within the organization and within projects. Machine users can't invite users, and the only way to authenticate and authorize a machine user is with an access key.

## Handling notifications

Notifications are alerts for the different types of events occurring in your EDB Postgres AI account, organizations, and projects. You can opt to get specific types of notifications and receive both in-app and email notifications. Different types of events are sent as notifications. Users with different roles can configure the preferences to receive these notifications in the in-app inbox, by email, or both.

Read more about [Notifications](./notifications).

## Observing account activity

Account activity is a log of all the actions taken by users in your EDB Postgres AI account. The account activity log is a record of all the actions taken by users in your EDB Postgres AI account. The log includes actions taken by users in organizations and projects. The account activity log is available to organization owners and project owners.
