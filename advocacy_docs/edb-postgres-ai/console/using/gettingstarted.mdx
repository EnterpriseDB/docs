The EDB Postgres® AI Console is a web-based user interface that provides a single pane of glass for managing and monitoring EDB Postgres AI Database Cloud Service, EDB Postgres AI databases, non-EDB Postgres such as AWS RDS, and any other Postgres installation. The EDB Postgres AI Console provides a unified view of the EDB Postgres AI Database Cloud Service and EDB Postgres AI databases, allowing users to manage and monitor their databases, users, and resources from a single interface.

## Accessing the EDB Postgres AI Console

To access the Console, you need to have an account with EDB Postgres AI. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for one for free at [registration page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/accounts/register/biganimal).

Once you have your account, you can access the Console by navigating to [the EDB Postgres AI console](https://portal.biganimal.com) and logging in with your EDB Postgres AI credentials.

## Start using the Console 

Once you have logged in to your EDB account, you’ll be able to go to the EDB Postgres AI Console.

The Console opens by default on overview page for your account and the “single pane of glass” for all your EDB Postgres AI services. You can get to this overview page by selecting the EDB logo in the top right hand corner.

## Exploring the Overview

In the body of the overview page, you can see two summaries of the [__Project__](#projects) and [__Estate__](#estate) views. 

You can directly access the full __Project__ and __Estate__ views by selecting the **Projects** or **Estate** buttons next to the EDB logo. 

## Projects

To create and manage resources, you’ll need a project. A project associates organizationally related resources together which enables simpler administration and access.

In the overview's view of projects, you can see the name of each project, an option to add tags, the number of clusters within the project and the number of users who have access to that project.

Selecting **View Projects** takes you to the [Projects](projects) tab for a full view.

If you are an owner of the organization, you can create new projects by selecting the **Create New Project** button. You'll be prompted for a name and, optionally, to select tags for the new project. Once done, select **Create New Project** and the project will be created and you will find yourself on the Project view for the new project, which has you as owner, ready to add resources.

Read more about working with [Projects](projects) in the Console.

## Estate	

The Estate view is your everything view of every resource - clusters, hosted, and managed, self-managed, analytics lakehouses, and managed storage locations - in every project. It cuts through the Projects demarcation to give a single unified view of all your resources. 

Rather than grouped into projects, the Estate overview grouped into types of resources.

Each resource shows its type, the number of instances of that resource and, on the right of the pane, a graphical representation or breakdown of those instances.

Selecting the **EDB Postgres AI Clusters** title takes you to the __EDB Postgres AI Cluster__ pane of the full Estate view.
