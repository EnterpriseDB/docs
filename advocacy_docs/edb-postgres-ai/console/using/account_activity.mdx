The activity logs collect EDB Postgres AI events based on user activity in the portal. There's an organization-level log of available users with organization roles and a project-level log. You can use the log to audit activities performed by users from your organizations or research activities that might have affected your account at either the organization level or the project level.

## Events

Events describe actions performed by users. The available actions are:

-   Create
-   Read
-   Update
-   Delete

Events are related to the following resource types:

-   Cluster
-   Data plane
-   User
-   User roles
-   Role permissions
-   Organization
-   Project

!!! Note
Database events don't log activity on the Postgres server. They log the use of the portal to create or modify database clusters.
