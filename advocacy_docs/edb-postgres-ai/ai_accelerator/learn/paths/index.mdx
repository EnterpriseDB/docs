# AI Factory Learning Paths

Use these curated learning paths to progressively build your knowledge and skills across all AI Factory capabilities — including Model Serving, Gen AI Builder, and Knowledge Bases.

The paths are ordered to reflect key concepts, dependencies, and real-world implementation priorities. Follow them step-by-step or explore specific areas as needed.

## 101: Foundations

**Audience:** New users of AI Factory, users familiar with databases and cloud but new to AI model deployment and applications.

**Goal:** Build a strong conceptual foundation and complete initial hands-on deployments.

**Estimated time:** ~1–2 hours.

### Required steps

## 201: Practical Applications

**Audience:** Users who have deployed initial models and want to build real-world applications and integrate with Gen AI Builder and Knowledge Bases.

**Goal:** Understand how to integrate AI services into applications and data pipelines.

**Estimated time:** ~2–4 hours.

## 301: Advanced Techniques and Optimization

**Audience:** Architects, platform engineers, and advanced developers integrating AI Factory deeply into products or pipelines.

**Goal:** Optimize performance, reliability, and scaling across AI Factory components.

**Estimated time:** varies by workload (~2–5+ hours).

### Model Serving
