title: Guide & Getting Started
description: Get started with Hybrid Manager, AI Factory, and Analytics for EDB Postgres AI.
---

Begin your journey with EDB Postgres® AI by exploring how to deploy, manage, and build intelligent systems across hybrid environments using Postgres, GenAI workloads, and analytics pipelines.

* * *

## What do you want to do?

Do you want to run analytical queries on your Postgres data?
Check out the [EDB Postgres® AI Analytics Accelerator documentation](/pgaa/latest/), which covers the Lakehouse engine, Delta Lake, Iceberg, and tiered storage.


Do you want to run GenAI or machine learning models on your data?
Explore the [EDB Postgres® AI Factory](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/ai-factory/), including tools for automated AI data pipelines, agent workflows, and model orchestration.

Do you want to manage hybrid workloads, self-managed databases, or model endpoints?
Visit the [EDB Postgres® AI Hybrid Manager](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/), which provides a Kubernetes-native control plane.

## Hybrid Manager

Hybrid Manager is the control plane that runs EDB Postgres AI. It provides a unified interface for managing database clusters, AI workloads, and analytics engines in any Kubernetes environment.

### Start here

-   [Overview](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/overview/)
-   [Install on Kubernetes](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/install/)
-   [Manage Postgres clusters](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/cluster_management/)
-   [Observability and diagnostics](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/monitoring/)
-   [Sovereign Data and AI Factory System](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/system/)

* * *

## AI Factory

AI Factory is a low-code environment for building GenAI systems, vector-enabled retrieval, and data-connected agents. It runs either standalone or orchestrated through Hybrid Manager.

### Learning paths

## Analytics & Pipelines

Analytics Accelerator enables analytics directly in Postgres by leveraging a vectorized query engine and columnar formats like Apache Iceberg® and Delta Lake. With separation of storage and compute and tiered tables that automatically manage hot and cold data, you can run analytical and transactional workloads concurrently without degrading performance
### Start here

-   [Lakehouse overview](/pgaa/latest/lakehouse/)
-   [Delta Lake](/pgaa/latest/delta_lake/)
-   [Iceberg](/pgaa/latest/iceberg/)

### Use cases

-   [Query tiered tables](/pgaa/latest/tiered_tables)
-   [Configure Delta PGFS](/pgaa/latest/delta_lake)
-   [Monitor tiered tables](/pgaa/latest/tiered_tables)
