Building on decades of Postgres expertise, the EDB Postgres® AI databases are the core of the EDB Postgres AI platform. 

-   [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest) can take on Oracle workloads.
-   [EDB Postgres Extended Server](/pge/latest) designed for large-scale, mission-critical enterprise workloads.
-   [EDB Postgres Distributed](/pgd/latest) provides distributed high availability and fault tolerance for mission-critical workloads using EPAS or PGE.

All of them are built on the same Postgres core, so you can use the same tools and skills across all of them.

- [PostgreSQL](/supported-open-source/postgresql) is the world's most advanced open source database, and the foundation for all EDB Postgres databases.

## Options for reliability and availability

Options for high availability and fault tolerance are available with all EDB databases

### Single instance

Single instance databases are great for development and testing, but for
production workloads, you need to consider high availability and fault
tolerance. You can include single instance databases for test and development
alongside your production high availability databases in the [EDB Postgres AI
Cloud Service](../cloud-service).

### Primary/secondary replication

Primary/Secondary replication is a common high availability solution for
databases. In this configuration, a primary database server is responsible for
processing read and write requests. A secondary database server is setup to
replicate the primary database server. If the primary database server fails, the
secondary database server can take over and become the primary database server. 

This configuration provides fault tolerance and high availability in a
particular location. This is available with EDB Postgres® Advanced Server (EPAS)
and EDB Postgres Extended Server (PGE). 

This is a standard configuration option on [EDB Postgres AI Cloud
Service](../cloud-service).

### Distributed high availability

High availability is a critical requirement for mission-critical workloads. EDB
Postgres Distributed (PGD) provides a distributed database environment designed
to ensure high availability and fault tolerance for mission-critical workloads.
PGD can use EPAS, PGE, or PostgreSQL databases as the underlying replicated
database. PGD is available for self-managed deployment and on the EDB Postgres
AI Cloud Service (as the Distributed High Availability option).

This is also a standard configuration option on [EDB Postgres AI Cloud
Service](../cloud-service).

## Deployment options

You can read more about how you can deploy these databases as:

-   hosted databases with the [EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service](../cloud-service)
-   managed databases with the [EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service](../cloud-service)
-   or self-managed in your own cloud or on-premises but visible in your [EDB Postgres AI Console](../console) using the [EDB Postgres AI Agent](../console/estate/agent/).
