Building on decades of Postgres expertise, the EDB PostgresÂ® databases are the core of the EDB Postgres AI platform. 

-   [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](epas) can take on Oracle workloads.
-   [EDB Postgres Extended Server](pge) designed for large-scale, mission-critical enterprise workloads.
-   [EDB Postgres Distributed](pgd) provides distributed high availability and fault tolerance for mission-critical workloads using EPAS or PGE.

There's also detailed information on [deployment options](options) for high availability and fault tolerance.

You can read more about how where can deploy them as:

-   hosted databases with the [EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service](../cloud-service)
-   managed databases with the [EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service](../cloud-service)
-   or self-managed in your own cloud or on-premises but visible in your [EDB Postgres AI Console](../console) using the [EDB Postgres AI Agent](/edb-postgres-ai/console/estate/agent/).
