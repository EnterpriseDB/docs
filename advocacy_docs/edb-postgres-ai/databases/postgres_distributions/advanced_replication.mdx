To benefit from advanced replication features, you must install and configure [EDB Postgres Distributed](/pgd/latest) with your Postgres database instance.

- [PGD - Choosing a Postgres distribution](/pgd/latest/planning/choosing_server/) collects a list of EDB Postgres Distributed features and their support per Postgres distribution.

To know which plan to get based on your Postgres distribution requirements, see [EDB Subscription Plans Comparison](https://www.enterprisedb.com/products/plans-comparison).
