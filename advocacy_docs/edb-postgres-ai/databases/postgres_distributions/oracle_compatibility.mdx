[didn't add the table as it would become outdated quickly, rather I am pointing at existing docs]: #

If you are migrating from Oracle, or your application was built using Oracle-specific syntax, compatibility with Oracle is a prerequisite for your Postgres database.

Only EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports Oracle features and syntax, among others:

-   [Built-in Oracle packages](/epas/latest/reference/oracle_compatibility_reference/epas_compat_bip_guide/03_built-in_packages/)

-   [Partitioning commands compatible with Oracle databases](/epas/latest/reference/oracle_compatibility_reference/04_partitioning_commands_compatible_with_oracle_databases/)

-   [dblink_ora functions and procedures](/epas/latest/reference/oracle_compatibility_reference/01_dblink_ora_functions_and_procedures/) 

-   [Oracle-compatible SQL commands](/epas/latest/reference/oracle_compatibility_reference/epas_compat_sql/)

-   [Oracle MERGE](/epas/latest/reference/oracle_compatibility_reference/epas_compat_sql/65a_merge/)
[maybe remove line 21 cause we added 19 that includes it]: # 

-   [Oracle data types](/epas/latest/reference/sql_reference/02_data_types/)

-   [Oracle catalog views](/epas/latest/reference/oracle_compatibility_reference/epas_compat_cat_views/oracle_compatible_views/62_dba_users/)

-   [Oracle functions and operators](/epas/latest/reference/sql_reference/03_functions_and_operators/)

-   [Oracle keywords](/epas/latest/reference/application_programmer_reference/stored_procedural_language_reference/17_advanced_server_keywords/#edb-postgres-advanced-server-keywords)

To know which plan to get based on your Postgres distribution requirements, see [EDB Subscription Plans Comparison](https://www.enterprisedb.com/products/plans-comparison).
