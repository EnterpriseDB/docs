OTEL is an extension that allows metrics to be sent through the OpenTelemetry (OTEL) protocol.  It communicates with an OTEL endpoint and sends metrics to it.  Other extensions can use APIs to pass metrics to `edb_otel`, which will in turn redirect to the otel endpoint.


OTEL includes a background worker process which is responsible for managing the metric instruments and exporting the metrics to the opentelemetry metrics collector. The worker handles calls to the OpenTelemetry C++ SDK, preventing them from blocking the main backend process. Metric data, reported by other backends via a shared memory queue, is periodically retrieved and processed by the worker.
