title: Release notes for EDB OTEL version 2.0.0
navTitle: "2.0.0"
---

Release date: 21 Aug 2025

This release marks the second release of `edb_otel` Postgres extension. 

### Key Features

- **Initial Support for Traces**: Uses OpenTelemetry C++ SDK with gRPC for the export of traces. Consult documentation for API and usage.
- **Additional Metric Types**: Support for `COUNTER`, `UPDOWN COUNTER` and `HISTOGRAM` and their long/double variants.

### Changes

- OpenTelemetry tracing support
- Support for new metric types
- Refactoring the public APIs for clarity and consistency. 

This release also expands on the supported platforms. In addition to Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 9, this release adds support for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8,
Debian 12 and Ubuntu 24.04. The efforts to cover additional platforms continue,
with the goal of matching the full set of platforms supported by the Postgres
distribution.

The update is not backward compatible with v1.0, but an upgrade path is provided.
Note that the new APIs are not backward compatible with v1.0 due to changes in
the API signatures and return types in some cases.

### Known Limitations

We have some known limitations in this release and we plan to address them in the future releases.

- The newly introduced support for traces is exposed via the SQL API only in this release. Support for C APIs will come in one of the upcoming releases.
- Trace environment is initialized per backend, therefore care must be taken to ensure optimal usage.
