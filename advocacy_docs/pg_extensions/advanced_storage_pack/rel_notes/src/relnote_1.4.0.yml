- relnote: Bluefin: do not compress tuple when not worth it
  details: |
    When trying regular LZ4 compression, if the size of compressed data is greater or equal to the size of the original data, use the original tuple. This helps to prevent adding "compressed" tuples bigger than the original one and potentially not fitting on the target page, which was choosen based on the size of the original tuple (before trying compression).
