product: Advanced Storage Pack
version: 1.3.0
date: 1 April 2025
intro: |
 Advanced Storage Pack 1.3.0 includes a number of enhancements and bug fixes.
highlights: |
  - **Improved Compression for large reference tuples**: ASP 1.3.0 Bluefin now compresses reference tuples where their length is greater than 500.
relnotes:
- relnote: Bluefin now compresses reference tuples.
  details: |
    Now Bluefin allows data compression of the reference tuples if their
    length exceeds `BLUEFIN_REF_TUPLE_COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD` (default value
    is 500), tuples that cannot be compressed are stored untouched and
    can still be used as reference tuples. This compression method is
    based on the LZ4 HC algorithm.

    Under certain circumstances (multiple variable length columns, tuple size
    between 1k and 2k), compressing the reference tuples using this
    method increases the compression rate from 28% to 57%.

    Sometimes, regular compression is better than delta-compression, this
    case is covered by checking if the length of the new delta-compressed
    tuple is larger than the size of its reference tuple (using regular
    compression), then, delta-compression is replaced by regular
    compression.
