Released: 1 April 2025

Advanced Storage Pack 1.3.0 includes a number of enhancements and bug fixes.

## Highlights

- **Improved Compression for large reference tuples**: ASP 1.3.0 Bluefin now compresses reference tuples where their length is greater than 500.

## Enhancements

<tr><td><details><summary>Bluefin now compresses reference tuples.</summary><hr/><p>Now Bluefin allows data compression of the reference tuples if their
length exceeds <code>BLUEFIN_REF_TUPLE_COMPRESSION_THRESHOLD</code> (default value
is 500), tuples that cannot be compressed are stored untouched and
can still be used as reference tuples. This compression method is
based on the LZ4 HC algorithm.</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances (multiple variable length columns, tuple size
between 1k and 2k), compressing the reference tuples using this
method increases the compression rate from 28% to 57%.</p>
<p>Sometimes, regular compression is better than delta-compression, this
case is covered by checking if the length of the new delta-compressed
tuple is larger than the size of its reference tuple (using regular
compression), then, delta-compression is replaced by regular
compression.</p>
