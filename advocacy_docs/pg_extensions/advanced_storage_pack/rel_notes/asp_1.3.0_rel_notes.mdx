<tr><td><details><summary>Better compression rate in Bluefin table access method.</summary><hr/><p>In order to provide better compression rate for large records including variable length fields (JSON, text), this new release of Bluefin can now decide to compress data using regular LZ4 compression, instead of delta compression. This new compression method can also be used to compress reference tuples. The reference tuples are the first tuples stored on a Postgres page, they are by definition not eligible to delta compression and were previously stored uncompressed. The choice of the compression method is automatically made by the table access method: the one giving the better compression rate is chosen. Under certain circumstances, this new release increases the compression rate from 28% to 57%.</p>
