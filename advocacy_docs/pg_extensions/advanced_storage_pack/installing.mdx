The Advanced Storage Pack is supported on the same platforms as the Postgres distribution you're using. Support for Advanced Storage Pack starts with Postgres 12 for Autocluster and Refdata, and with Postgres 15 for Bluefin. For details, see:

- [EDB Postgres Advanced Server Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#epas)

- [PostgreSQL Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#pg)

- [EDB Postgres Extended Server Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#epas_extended)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install Postgres. See:
  - [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/installing/)

  - [Installing PostgreSQL](../../supported-open-source/postgresql/installing/) 

  - [Installing EDB Postgres Extended Server](/pge/latest/installing/)

- Set up the repository.

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.


## Install the package

The syntax for the package install command is:

```shell
sudo <package-manager> -y install edb-<postgres><postgres_version>-advanced-storage-pack
```

Where: 

- `<package-manager>`is the package manager used with your operating system:

  | Package manager |             Operating system     |
  | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | dnf             | RHEL 8/9 and derivatives         |
  | yum             | RHEL 7 and derivatives, CentOS 7 |
  | zypper          | SLES                             |
  | apt-get         | Debian and Ubuntu                |

- `<postgres>` is the distribution of Postgres you're using:

 |    Postgres distribution     |   Value    |
 | ---------------------------- | ---------- |
 | PostgreSQL                   | pg         |
 | EDB Postgres Advanced Server | as         |
 | EDB Postgres Extended        | postgresextended |

- `<postgres_version>` is the version of Postgres you're using.

For example, to install Advanced Storage Pack for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14 on a RHEL 8 platform:

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-as14-advanced-storage-pack
```
