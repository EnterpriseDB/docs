The Advanced Storage Pack is supported on the same platforms as the Postgres distribution you're using. Support for Advanced Storage Pack starts with Postgres 11. For details, see:

- [EDB Postgres Advanced Server Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#epas)

- [PostgreSQL Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#pg)

- [EDB Postgres Distributed (includes EDB Postgres Extended)](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#bdr)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install Postgres. See:
  - [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux/installing_epas_using_edb_repository/)

  - [Installing PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) 

  - [Installing EDB Postgres Distributed (includes EDB Postgres Extended)](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/deployments/tpaexec/)

- Set up the repository.

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.


## Install the package

The syntax for the RPM package install command is:

```shell
sudo <package-manager> -y install edb-<postgres><postgres_version>-advanced-storage-pack<major_version>
```

The syntax for the Debian package install command is:

```shell
sudo <package-manager> -y install edb-<postgres><postgres_version>-advanced-storage-pack-<major_version>
```

Where: 

- `<package-manager>`is the package manager used with your operating system:

  | apt-get         | Debian and derivatives           |
