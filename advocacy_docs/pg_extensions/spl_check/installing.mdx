The syntax to install the package is:

```shell
sudo <package-manager> -y install edb-as<version>-spl-check
```

Where: 
- `<package-manager>` is the package manager used with your operating system:

  | Package manager |             Operating system     |
  | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | dnf             | RHEL 8/9 and derivatives         |
  | yum             | RHEL 7 and derivatives, CentOS 7 |
  | zypper          | SLES                             |
  | apt-get         | Debian and derivatives           |


- `<version>` is the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server you're using.

For example, to install EDB SPL Check for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17 on a RHEL 8 platform:

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-as17-spl-check
```
