Apache AGE is supported on the same platforms as the Postgres distribution you're using. Postgres versions 14 to 16 are supported for Apache AGE. For details, see:

- [EDB Postgres Advanced Server Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#epas)
- [PostgreSQL Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#pg)
- [EDB Postgres Extended Server Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#epas_extended)

## Installation

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install Postgres. See: 

  - [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/installing/)

  - [Installing PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) 

  - [Installing EDB Postgres Extended Server](/pge/latest/installing/)

- Set up the repository.

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you've already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

## Install the package

For SLES, RHEL and its derivatives the install command is:

```shell
sudo <package-manager> -y install edb-<postgres><postgres_version>-age1
```

Where: 
- `<package-manager>`is the package manager used with your operating system:

  | Package manager | Operating system                 |
  |-----------------|----------------------------------|
  | dnf             | RHEL 8/9 and derivatives         |
  | zypper          | SLES                             |

- `<postgres>` is the distribution of Postgres you're using:

 |    Postgres distribution     |   Value    |
 | ---------------------------- | ---------- |
 | PostgreSQL                   | pg         |
 | EDB Postgres Advanced Server | as         |
 | EDB Postgres Extended Server | postgresextended |

- `<postgres_version>` is the version of Postgres you're using.

For example, to install Apache AGE for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 16 on a RHEL 8 platform:

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-as16-age1
```

For Debian and Ubuntu:

```shell
sudo <package-manager> -y install edb-<postgres><postgres_version>-age-1
```

Where: 
- `<package-manager>`is `apt-get` for Debian and Ubuntu.

- `<postgres>` is the distribution of Postgres you're using:

 |    Postgres distribution     |   Value    |
 | ---------------------------- | ---------- |
 | PostgreSQL                   | pg         |
 | EDB Postgres Advanced Server | as         |
 | EDB Postgres Extended Server | postgresextended |

- `<postgres_version>` is the version of your Postgres.

For example, to install Apache AGE for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 16 on a Debian platform:

```shell
sudo apt-get -y install edb-as16-age-1
```
