Apache AGE (A Graph Extension) is a powerful PostgreSQL extension that turns your existing relational database into a multi-model system by adding graph database capabilities. Inspired by Bitnine's AgensGraph, AGE is designed to use a single storage layer for both relational and graph data. This unified approach lets users query their data using both standard ANSI SQL and the popular graph query language, openCypher, addressing the strong need for cohesive, easy-to-implement multi-model databases. Because it's a PostgreSQL extension, AGE retains all of PostgreSQL's features while providing a fully integrated graph model.
