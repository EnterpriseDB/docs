VectorChord packages are available via the EDB repositories. The extension uses the `pgvector` `vector` data type and adds the VectorChord index access method (`vchordq`).

Prerequisites

- Supported Postgres (EPAS or PostgreSQL) per the EDB compatibility matrix
- EDB repositories configured on the host
- `pgvector` installed for the `vector` data type

Install steps

1) Install Postgres and configure the EDB repositories.
2) Install `pgvector` (provides the `vector` type).
3) Install the VectorChord package (provides the `vchordq` index access method).

Packaging and provenance

- EDB builds, signs, and publishes packages across supported platforms.
- Each package build records the upstream source it was built from. To view it, check the package changelog or metadata:
  - RPM‑based: `rpm -q --changelog <package>` or `dnf info <package>`
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `apt changelog <package>` or `apt show <package>`
- Verify repository signatures using the EDB GPG key installed during repository setup.
