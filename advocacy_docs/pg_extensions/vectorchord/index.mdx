VectorChord adds a high‑performance vector index to Postgres that works with the `pgvector` `vector` data type. It is independent of pgvector’s HNSW/IVF indexes and targets large‑scale, low‑latency vector search.

- Index type: IVF‑RaBitQ (`vchordq`)
- Optimized for: large vector volumes, lower query latencies, higher‑dimension embeddings
- Compatible with: `vector` column type from the `pgvector` extension

Use cases

- RAG at scale: Billions of vectors, frequent top‑k lookups with tight latency budgets.
- High‑dimensional embeddings: Multimodal or LLM‑generated vectors with larger dimensions than typical ANN setups.
- Low‑latency APIs: Recommendation, personalization, and semantic search where P95/P99 latency matters.

When to choose VectorChord

- Your pgvector HNSW/IVF indexes struggle with high dimensions or large data volumes.
- You need lower query latency for top‑k searches at high throughput.
- You want to stay on the `vector` type while changing only the index implementation.

Quick start

1) Install `pgvector` (for the `vector` type) and the VectorChord package.
2) Create a table with a `vector` column and load embeddings.
3) Build a VectorChord index and run ANN queries.

Example

```sql
-- Table with vector embeddings
CREATE TABLE items (
  id bigint primary key,
  embedding vector(1024)
);

-- Create a VectorChord index (IVF‑RaBitQ)
CREATE INDEX items_embedding_vchordq
  ON items
  USING vchordq (embedding);

-- Example query (distance operator depends on your metric)
-- For illustration, using a placeholder parameter :query_vec
SELECT id
FROM items
ORDER BY embedding <-> :query_vec
LIMIT 10;
```

Best practices

- Choose a consistent distance metric; ensure it matches query operators.
- Batch index builds during off‑peak hours; monitor memory and I/O.
- Periodically reindex if the data distribution or scale changes significantly.
