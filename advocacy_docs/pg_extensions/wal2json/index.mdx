wal2json (`wal2json`) is an extension released as open source software under the PostgreSQL License. 

`wal2json` is an output plugin for logical decoding.  It has access to the following:

 - Tuples produced by INSERT and UPDATE.
 - UPDATE/DELETE old row versions *(depending on the configured replica identity)*. 

 Changes can be consumed using the streaming protocol (logical replication slots) or by a SQL API.
