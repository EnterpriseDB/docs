title: Configuring EDB Postgres Tuner
navTitle: Configuring
--- 

To run EDB Postgres Tuner, you need to add it to the `shared_preload_libraries` and create the extension in the database. EDB Postgres Tuner can then gather metrics to make tuning recommendations. 

1. In the `postgresql.conf` file, add `edb_pg_tuner` to the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter:

   ```ini
   shared_preload_libraries = 'edb_pg_tuner'
   ```

   !!! Note
   If `shared_preload_libraries` has other extensions, then you can add `edb_pg_tuner` to the list. The order doesn't matter. 
   !!!

1. Restart Postgres. 

1. Create the EDB Postgres Tuner extension in your database: 

   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION edb_pg_tuner;
   ```

## Parameters 

The following custom GUCs control the EDB Postgres Tuner extension behavior. If you modify these parameters, then reload Postgres to apply the changes. 

- `edb_pg_tuner.autotune` &mdash; Applies tuning recommendations. The default is `false`. 

- `edb_pg_tuner.naptime` &mdash; Sets the interval between each check in seconds. The default is 600 seconds (10 minutes).

- `edb_pg_tuner.max_wal_size_limit` &mdash; Sets the maximum value for the `max_wal_size` recommendation. The default is `0`, which sets no limit.

The following custom GUCs control the EDB Postgres Tuner `work_mem` tuning behavior for Postgres 14 and later.  

- `edb_pg_tuner.tune_work_mem` &mdash; Dynamically increases the work mem for queries with disk spill to improve performance. The default is `true`.

- `edb_pg_tuner.work_mem_pool` &mdash; Maximum additional work_mem reserve that's allocated to queries with disk spill. The default is 2GB.

- `edb_pg_tuner.log_min_duration` &mdash; Execution time threshold in ms for statistics logging. The default is 0, which logs everything. The value -1 turns off logging.

- `edb_pg_tuner.buffer_size` &mdash; Maximum query count for tracking statistics. The default is 5000.

## Recommended GUCs

EDB Postgres Tuner can recommend the following GUCs. The `static` category provides fixed recommendation settings. The `dynamic` category uses specific algorithms to suggest a better setting according to your workload or hardware resources.

!!! Note
    For EDB Postgres Advanced Server, if `edb_pg_tuner.autotune` is enabled, a service restart may be required: 

    - Version 15 or later: Any GUC that requires a restart is set when the service starts, therefore you don't need to restart the service to apply the recommendations.
    - Version 14 and earlier: You need to restart the service.
