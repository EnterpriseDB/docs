You can use EDB Postgres Tuner in two ways: to automatically apply all tuning recommendations or to manually apply selected tuning recommendations. 

## Automatic tuning

To automatically apply all tuning recommendations, set the `edb_pg_tuner.autotune` parameter to `true`. Restart Postgres to apply the change. EDB Postgres Tuner then begins applying tuning recommendations.  

!!! Note
    Automatic tuning isn't currently supported for BigAnimal.

## Manual tuning

To manually apply selected tuning recommendations, make sure the `edb_pg_tuner.autotune` parameter is set to `false`, which is the default. Then, use the `edb_pg_tuner_recommendations` function to inspect the tuning recommendations from the output. 

You can set the format of the tuning recommendations to either `conf` or `sql`. For example:

```sql
SELECT edb_pg_tuner_recommendations('sql');
```

Where:

- `conf` provides an output like `parameter = value`, which you can copy and paste into your configuration file. This is the default. 

- `sql` provides an output like `ALTER SYSTEM SET parameter = value`, which you can execute in your preferred Postgres client tool. 

### Example

This example shows how to manually apply tuning recommendations to a `postgresql.conf` file. 

Here's an example of settings in a `postgresql.conf` file:

```ini
checkpoint_completion_target = 0.2
effective_cache_size = '4GB'
enable_seqscan = off
fsync = off
full_page_writes = off
max_wal_size = '2MB'
seq_page_cost = 1.3
shared_buffers = '128MB'
```

The following command provides tuning recommendations for the `postgresql.conf` file in the default `conf` format:

```sql
postgres=# SELECT * FROM edb_pg_tuner_recommendations();
__OUTPUT__
           recommendation
------------------------------------
 checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9
 effective_cache_size = '4653 MB'
 enable_seqscan = on
 fsync = on
 full_page_writes = on
 max_wal_size = '84MB'
 maintenance_work_mem = '524 MB'
 shared_buffers = '1474 MB'
(8 rows)
```

The following command provides an output in the `sql` format:

```sql
postgres=# SELECT edb_pg_tuner_recommendations('sql');
__OUTPUT__
             edb_pg_tuner_recommendations
------------------------------------------------------
 ALTER SYSTEM SET checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9;
 ALTER SYSTEM SET effective_cache_size = '4653 MB';
 ALTER SYSTEM SET enable_seqscan = on;
 ALTER SYSTEM SET fsync = on;
 ALTER SYSTEM SET full_page_writes = on;
 ALTER SYSTEM SET max_wal_size = '84MB';
 ALTER SYSTEM SET maintenance_work_mem = '524 MB';
 ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_buffers = '1474 MB';
(8 rows)
```

You can copy and paste the tuning recommendations in the `conf` format into the `postgresql.conf` file: 

```ini
checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9
effective_cache_size = '4653 MB'
enable_seqscan = on
fsync = on
full_page_writes = on
max_wal_size = '84MB'
maintenance_work_mem = '524 MB'
shared_buffers = '1474 MB'
```

You can execute the tuning recommendations in the `sql` format in your preferred Postgres client tool:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9;
ALTER SYSTEM SET effective_cache_size = '4653 MB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET enable_seqscan = on;
ALTER SYSTEM SET fsync = on;
ALTER SYSTEM SET full_page_writes = on;
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_wal_size = '84MB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET maintenance_work_mem = '524 MB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_buffers = '1474 MB';
```

## Monitoring

You can use the following SQL functions to monitor statistics information:

- edb_pg_tuner_global_stats()
- autotuner_query_stats()

### edb_pg_tuner_global_stats() shows:
- The total number of queries that have executed regardless of whether or not were logged.
- The size of the query hash table in shared memory (edb_pg_tuner.buffer_size).
- The number of unique queries in the shared memory buffer (capped at edb_pg_tuner.buffer_size).
- The number of entries that have been deallocated from the shared memory buffer.
- The size of the reserved work_mem pool (edb_pg_tuner.work_mem_pool).
- The amount of the memory pool (in KiB) that is currently allocated to running queries.

```sql
postgres=# SELECT * FROM edb_pg_tuner_global_stats();

           stats_reset            | total_queries | buffer_size | unique_queries | deallocation
s | pool_size | pool_used
----------------------------------+---------------+-------------+----------------+-------------
--+-----------+-----------
 04-NOV-24 10:11:34.876737 +05:30 |            52 |        5000 |             19 |
0 |   2097152 |         0
(1 row)
```

### autotuner_query_stats() shows for each query in the buffer:

- The query ID (the same as pg_stat_statements uses).
- The number of times the query has executed.
- The maximum amount of sort disk spill recorded in any node in any invocation of the query.
- The maximum amount of sort nodes in the execution plan of any invocation of the query.
- The maximum amount of hash aggregate disk spill recorded in any node in any invocation of the query.
- The maximum amount of hash aggregate nodes in the execution plan of any invocation of the query.

```sql
postgres=# SELECT * FROM edb_pg_tuner_query_stats() WHERE sort_spill > 0 OR hash_spill > 0;

      query_id       | executed | sort_spill | sort_nodes | hash_spill | hash_nodes
---------------------+----------+------------+------------+------------+------------
 8309825044411750783 |        6 |     146656 |          1 |          0 |          0

 -264435973028163932 |        2 |      12592 |          1 |          0 |          0
 3595982096380934851 |        3 |    1256528 |          1 |          0 |          0
(4 rows)
```
## Recommended GUCs

EDB Postgres Tuner can recommend the following GUCs. The `static` category provides fixed recommendation settings. The `dynamic` category uses specific algorithms to suggest a better setting according to your workload or hardware resources.

!!! Note
    If `edb_pg_tuner.autotune` is enabled on EDB Postgres Advanced Server 15 or later, any GUC that requires a restart is set when the service starts. Hence, you don't need to restart the service to apply the recommendations. On earlier EDB Postgres Advanced Server versions (14 and earlier), you do need to restart the service.
