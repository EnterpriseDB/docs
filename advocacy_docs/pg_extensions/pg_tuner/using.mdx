title: Using EDB Postgres Tuner
navTitle: Using
---

You can use EDB Postgres Tuner in two ways: to automatically apply all tuning recommendations or to manually apply selected tuning recommendations. 

## Automatic tuning

To automatically apply all tuning recommendations, set the `edb_pg_tuner.autotune` parameter to `true`. Restart Postgres to apply the change. EDB Postgres Tuner then begins applying tuning recommendations.  

!!! Note
    Automatic tuning isn't currently supported for BigAnimal.

## Manual tuning

To manually apply selected tuning recommendations, make sure the `edb_pg_tuner.autotune` parameter is set to `false`, which is the default. Then, use the `edb_pg_tuner_recommendations` function to inspect the tuning recommendations from the output. 

You can set the format of the tuning recommendations to either `conf` or `sql`. For example:

```sql
SELECT edb_pg_tuner_recommendations('sql');
```

Where:

- `conf` provides an output like `parameter = value`, which you can copy and paste into your configuration file. This is the default. 

- `sql` provides an output like `ALTER SYSTEM SET parameter = value`, which you can execute in your preferred Postgres client tool. 

### Example

This example shows how to manually apply tuning recommendations to a `postgresql.conf` file. 

Here's an example of settings in a `postgresql.conf` file:

```ini
checkpoint_completion_target = 0.2
effective_cache_size = '4GB'
enable_seqscan = off
fsync = off
full_page_writes = off
max_wal_size = '2MB'
seq_page_cost = 1.3
shared_buffers = '128MB'
```

The following command provides tuning recommendations for the `postgresql.conf` file in the default `conf` format:

```sql
postgres=# SELECT * FROM edb_pg_tuner_recommendations();
__OUTPUT__
           recommendation
------------------------------------
 checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9
 effective_cache_size = '4653 MB'
 enable_seqscan = on
 fsync = on
 full_page_writes = on
 max_wal_size = '84MB'
 maintenance_work_mem = '524 MB'
 shared_buffers = '1474 MB'
(8 rows)
```

The following command provides an output in the `sql` format:

```sql
postgres=# SELECT edb_pg_tuner_recommendations('sql');
__OUTPUT__
             edb_pg_tuner_recommendations
------------------------------------------------------
 ALTER SYSTEM SET checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9;
 ALTER SYSTEM SET effective_cache_size = '4653 MB';
 ALTER SYSTEM SET enable_seqscan = on;
 ALTER SYSTEM SET fsync = on;
 ALTER SYSTEM SET full_page_writes = on;
 ALTER SYSTEM SET max_wal_size = '84MB';
 ALTER SYSTEM SET maintenance_work_mem = '524 MB';
 ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_buffers = '1474 MB';
(8 rows)
```

You can copy and paste the tuning recommendations in the `conf` format into the `postgresql.conf` file: 

```ini
checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9
effective_cache_size = '4653 MB'
enable_seqscan = on
fsync = on
full_page_writes = on
max_wal_size = '84MB'
maintenance_work_mem = '524 MB'
shared_buffers = '1474 MB'
```

You can execute the tuning recommendations in the `sql` format in your preferred Postgres client tool:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9;
ALTER SYSTEM SET effective_cache_size = '4653 MB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET enable_seqscan = on;
ALTER SYSTEM SET fsync = on;
ALTER SYSTEM SET full_page_writes = on;
ALTER SYSTEM SET max_wal_size = '84MB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET maintenance_work_mem = '524 MB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_buffers = '1474 MB';
```

## Auto-tuning `work_mem`

For Postgres 14 and higher, you can use EDB Postgres Tuner to optimize query performance by proactively adjusting the `work_mem` parameter based on historical execution data. This can reduce disk I/O and improve overall query performance.

### Memory Pool and Usage Limits:

Before a query is planned and executed, EDB Postgres Tuner will check the hash table to determine if a previous execution of the query resulted in disk spills. If there was a spill, a new `work_mem` value is calculated using the following formula:

```bash
new_work_mem = ceil(max(1.75 * previous_sort_spill, 5.0 * previous_hash_spill))
```

- This calculation aims to allocate sufficient memory to avoid disk spills for the current execution. 
- In-memory sorts and hash aggregates require more memory than when run with disk spills. 
- While calculating the exact amount is non-trivial (if possible at all), the values of 1.75 and 5 have worked well in test cases. 

### Requirements and Limitations for auto-tuning `work_mem`

- The new `work_mem` value will be subject to the memory pool usage limits.
- A memory pool of `edb_pg_tuner.work_mem_pool` size is allocated to address these additional memory requirements. 
- A particular query can utilize a maximum of 25% of this memory pool. 
- If the required memory exceeds either the remaining space in the pool or the 25% limit, the `work_mem` will not be increased, and the query will execute with the default `work_mem` setting.

!!!Warning

Because `work_mem` is allocated from a pool on a per-query basis, based on the highest disk spill previously seen for the query, it's possible for memory to be over allocated, because each query might use that amount of memory in each of multiple sort or hash aggregate nodes in the execution plan.
!!!

- The following example shows `work_mem` automatically bumped based on a disk spill for the previous query execution:

```sql
SET client_min_messages='debug2';

## Logging

For Postgres 14 and higher, you can use EDB Postgres Tuner to log query statistics.

### Requirements and Limitations for logging:

- The queries that exceed the `edb_pg_tuner.log_min_duration` execution time are logged. 
- The sort and hash aggregate nodes of the query plan that caused the biggest spill to disk including the parallel workers are added. 
- This data along with the number of times executed and query id is stored in a hash table in shared memory.
- If the `edb_pg_tuner.log_min_duration` is disabled, the auto tuning will still occur for already logged queries.
- If the `edb_pg_tuner.tune_work_mem` is disabled, only statistics will be logged for eligible queries.
- If both are disabled, then neither function is performed.

## Monitoring

You can use the following SQL functions to monitor statistics information:

- `edb_pg_tuner_global_stats()`
- `edb_pg_tuner_query_stats()`

### edb_pg_tuner_global_stats()

The `edb_pg_tuner_global_stats()` shows:

- The total number of queries that have executed regardless of whether or not were logged.
- The size of the query hash table in shared memory (`edb_pg_tuner.buffer_size`).
- The number of unique queries in the shared memory buffer (capped at `edb_pg_tuner.buffer_size`).
- The number of entries that have been deallocated from the shared memory buffer.
- The size of the reserved `work_mem` pool (`edb_pg_tuner.work_mem_pool`).
- The amount of the memory pool (in KiB) that is currently allocated to running queries.

```sql
postgres=# SELECT * FROM edb_pg_tuner_global_stats();

           stats_reset            | total_queries | buffer_size | unique_queries | deallocation
s | pool_size | pool_used

0 |   2097152 |         0
(1 row)
```

### edb_pg_tuner_query_stats()

The `edb_pg_tuner_query_stats()` function shows for each query in the buffer:

- The query ID (the same as `pg_stat_statements` uses).
- The number of times the query has executed.
- The maximum amount of sort disk spill recorded in any node in any invocation of the query.
- The maximum amount of sort nodes in the execution plan of any invocation of the query.
- The maximum amount of hash aggregate disk spill recorded in any node in any invocation of the query.
- The maximum amount of hash aggregate nodes in the execution plan of any invocation of the query.

```sql
postgres=# SELECT * FROM edb_pg_tuner_query_stats() WHERE sort_spill > 0 OR hash_spill > 0;

      query_id       | executed | sort_spill | sort_nodes | hash_spill | hash_nodes

(4 rows)
```

!!!Warning

The `edb_pg_tuner_global_stats()` and `edb_pg_tuner_query_stats()` functions are supported for Postgres 14 and higher versions.  For Postgres 13 and lower versions, the functions will return the following error:

```sql
 postgres=# SELECT * FROM edb_pg_tuner_global_stats();
ERROR:  "edb_pg_tuner_global_stats" is not supported in this version

postgres=# SELECT * FROM edb_pg_tuner_query_stats();
ERROR:  "edb_pg_tuner_query_stats" is not supported in this version
```
