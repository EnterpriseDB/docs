Released: 12 June 2025

This is the First public release of EDB Stat Monitor (edb_stat_monitor), a new statistics monitoring tool. 
It is built upon the foundation of pg_stat_monitor. 
edb_stat_monitor introduces enhanced capabilities for query performance analysis.

## Highlights

- New sampling logic with setting for `edbsm_sample_rate`.
- More precise calculation of quantiles.
- Controllable compression levels.
- New functions: `edb_stat_monitor_td_histogram` and `edb_stat_monitor_td_quantile`.

<tr><td><details><summary>Added digest logic</summary><hr/><p>The digest logic has been added to the collection of execution time data,
allowing for the calculation of more precise quantiles. This enhancement
improves the accuracy of query performance analysis by providing better
insights into execution time distribution.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Added GUC parameter <code>td_compression</code></summary><hr/><p>A new GUC parameter, <code>td_compression</code>, has been introduced to control the
compression level of the t-digest data structure. This allows users to
optimize the balance between memory usage and accuracy in execution time
quantile calculations.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Added GUC parameter <code>edbsm_sample_rate</code></summary><hr/><p>The new GUC parameter <code>edbsm_sample_rate</code> has been added to control the
sampling rate for query execution statistics. This feature allows users to
adjust the frequency of data collection, enabling more efficient resource
usage while still capturing essential performance metrics.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>New function <code>edb_stat_monitor_td_histogram</code></summary><hr/><p>The new function <code>edb_stat_monitor_td_histogram</code> has been added to display
the t-digest histogram. This function provides a visual representation of
the execution time distribution, helping users to better understand query
performance patterns.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>New function <code>edb_stat_monitor_td_quantile</code></summary><hr/><p>The new function <code>edb_stat_monitor_td_quantile</code> has been introduced to
calculate percentiles using the t-digest algorithm. This function allows
users to obtain precise quantile values for execution times, enhancing
performance analysis capabilities.</p>
