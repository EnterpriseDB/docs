product: EDB Stat Monitor
version: 2.1.0
date: 12 June 2025
intro: |
  This is the First public release of EDB Stat Monitor (edb_stat_monitor), a new statistics monitoring tool. 
  It is built upon the foundation of pg_stat_monitor. 
  edb_stat_monitor introduces enhanced capabilities for query performance analysis.
highlights: |
  - More precise calculation of quantiles.
  - Controllable compression levels.
  - New functions: `edb_stat_monitor_td_histogram` and `edb_stat_monitor_td_quantile`.
relnotes:
- relnote: First public release of EDB Stat Monitor (edb_stat_monitor)
  type: Feature
  impact: High
- relnote: Added digest logic
  details: |
    The digest logic has been added to the collection of execution time data,
    allowing for the calculation of more precise quantiles. This enhancement
    improves the accuracy of query performance analysis by providing better
    insights into execution time distribution.
  type: Feature
  impact: High
- relnote: Added GUC parameter `td_compression`
  details: |
    A new GUC parameter, `td_compression`, has been introduced to control the
    compression level of the t-digest data structure. This allows users to
    optimize the balance between memory usage and accuracy in execution time
    quantile calculations.
  type: Feature
  impact: Medium
- relnote: New function `edb_stat_monitor_td_histogram`
  details: |
    The new function `edb_stat_monitor_td_histogram` has been added to display
    the t-digest histogram. This function provides a visual representation of
    the execution time distribution, helping users to better understand query
    performance patterns.
  type: Feature
  impact: Medium
- relnote: New function `edb_stat_monitor_td_quantile`
  details: |
    The new function `edb_stat_monitor_td_quantile` has been introduced to
    calculate percentiles using the t-digest algorithm. This function allows
    users to obtain precise quantile values for execution times, enhancing
    performance analysis capabilities.
