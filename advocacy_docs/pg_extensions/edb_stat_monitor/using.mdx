EDB Stat Monitor is a PostgreSQL extension that provides query performance monitoring capabilities. It collects and stores statistics about SQL queries executed on the database, allowing users to analyze query performance and identify potential bottlenecks.

## Pre-requisites

Before you can use EDB Stat Monitor, you need to install it and configure it in your PostgreSQL database. For installation instructions, see the [Installing EDB Stat Monitor](installing) documentation.

Once installed, you need to then configure EDB Stat Monitor in your database. Specifically, adding the shared library to your database cluster and creating the extension in your database. For configuration instructions, see the [Configuring EDB Stat Monitor](configuring) documentation.

## Querying EDB Stat Monitor

Once EDB Stat Monitor is enabled, you can query the `edb_stat_monitor` view to retrieve query performance statistics. The view contains aggregated data about executed queries, including execution time, number of calls, and other relevant metrics.
