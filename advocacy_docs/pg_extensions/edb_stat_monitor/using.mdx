EDB Stat Monitor is a PostgreSQL extension that provides query performance monitoring capabilities. It collects and stores statistics about SQL queries executed on the database, allowing users to analyze query performance and identify potential bottlenecks.

## Enabling EDB Stat Monitor

To enable EDB Stat Monitor, you need to load the extension into your PostgreSQL database. This can be done by executing the following SQL command:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION edb_stat_monitor;
```

This command creates the necessary database objects for EDB Stat Monitor to function.

## Querying EDB Stat Monitor

Once EDB Stat Monitor is enabled, you can query the `edb_stat_monitor` view to retrieve query performance statistics. The view contains aggregated data about executed queries, including execution time, number of calls, and other relevant metrics.
