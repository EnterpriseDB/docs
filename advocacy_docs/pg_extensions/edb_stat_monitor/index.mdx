EDB Stat Monitor is an extension that provides query performance monitoring for EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL. It collects and stores statistics about query execution, allowing you to analyze and optimize query performance.

Based on [pg_stat_monitor](https://github.com/percona/pg_stat_monitor), EDB Stat Monitor offers similar functionality with enhanced capabilities for query performance analysis and enhancements for EDB Postgres environments.
