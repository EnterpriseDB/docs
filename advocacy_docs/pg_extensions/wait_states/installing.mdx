## On all Linux systems except Debian and Ubuntu

To install EDB Wait States on any Linux operating system except Debian or Ubuntu:

1.  Enter the following command:

  ```shell
  sudo <package-manager> -y install <install-package-name>
  ```

  Where: 
  
    - `<package-manager>`is the package manager used with your operating system.

      | Package manager | Operating system     |
      | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
      | dnf             | RHEL 8/9 and derivatives         |
      | yum             | RHEL 7 and derivatives, CentOS 7 |
      | zypper          | SLES                             |

    - `<install-package-name>` is the name of the Postgres distribution you're using. In the package names, `<version>` is the version of the Postgres distribution. 

      | Type of Postgres distribution | Install command                             |
      | ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
      | PostgreSQL                    | postgresql`<version>`-edb_wait_states       |
      | EDB Postgres Advanced Server  | edb-as`<version>`-server-edb_wait_states    |
      | EDB Postgres Extended Server  | edb-postgresextended`<version>`-wait-states |
 
   
  For example, to install EDB Wait States for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 16 on a RHEL 9 platform:

  ```shell
  sudo dnf -y install edb-as16-server-edb_wait_states
  ```
  
1. To launch the worker, register it in the `postgresql.conf` file using the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter. For example:

  ```ini
  shared_preload_libraries = '$libdir/edb_wait_states'
  ```

1.  Restart the database server. After a successful restart, the background worker begins collecting data.

1. To review the data, create the following extension:

  ```sql
  CREATE EXTENSION edb_wait_states;
  ```

## On Debian and Ubuntu

To install EDB Wait States on Debian or Ubuntu:

1.  Enter the following command:

  ```shell
  sudo apt-get -y install <install-package-name>
  ```

  Where: 
  
  `<install-package-name>` is the name of the Postgres distribution you're using. In the package names, `<version>` is the version of the Postgres distribution. 

  | Type of Postgres distribution | Install command                              |
  | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
  | PostgreSQL                    | postgresql`<version>`-edb-wait-states        |
  | EDB Postgres Advanced Server  | edb-as`<version>`-server-edb-wait-states     |
  | EDB Postgres Extended Server  | edb-postgresextended-wait-states-`<version>` |
 
  For example, to install EDB Wait States for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 16 on a Debian 11 platform:

  ```shell
  sudo apt-get -y install edb-as16-server-edb-wait-states
  ```

  
1. To launch the worker, register it in the `postgresql.conf` file using the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter. For example:

  ```ini
  shared_preload_libraries = '$libdir/edb_wait_states'
  ```

1.  Restart the database server. After a successful restart, the background worker begins collecting data.

1. To review the data, create the following extension:

  ```sql
  CREATE EXTENSION edb_wait_states;
  ```


## On Windows

An EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation includes support for EDB Wait States. After installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you need to perform some additional steps to activate EDB Wait States.

1. To register the worker, modify the `postgresql.conf` file to include the EDB Wait States library in the `shared_preload_libraries` configuration parameter. The parameter value must include:

  ```ini
  shared_preload_libraries = '$libdir/edb_wait_states.dll'
  ```

  The EDB Wait States installation places the `edb_wait_states.dll` library file in the following path:

  ```text
  C:\Program Files\edb\as<xx>\lib\
  ```

  Where `<xx>` is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version, such as `as16`.

1. Restart the database server to make the changes take effect. After a successful restart, the background worker starts and begins collecting the data.

1. To view the data, create the following extension:

   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION edb_wait_states;
   ```

The installer places the `edb_wait_states.control` file in the following path:

```text
C:\Program Files\edb\as14\share\extension
```

## Uninstalling

To uninstall EDB Wait States:

1.  Use the `DROP EXTENSION` command to drop the `edb_wait_states` extension. 
1.  Modify the `postgresql.conf` file. Remove `$libdir/edb_wait_states` (for Linux) or `$libdir/edb_wait_states.dll` (for Windows) from the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter. 
1.  To apply your changes, restart the database server.
