The EDB wait states contrib module contains two main components.

## EDB Wait States Background Worker (EWSBW)

When the wait states background worker is registered as one of the shared preload libraries, EWSBW probes each of the running sessions at regular intervals.

For every session, it collects information such as:

-  The database to which it's connected
-  The logged-in user of the session
-  The query running in that session
-  The wait events on which it's waiting

This information is saved in a set of files in a user-configurable path and directory folder given by the `edb_wait_states.directory` parameter to add to the `postgresql.conf` file. The path must be a full, absolute path, not a relative path.

To install EWSBW on a Linux system:

1.  Install EDB wait states with the `edb-asxx-server-edb_wait_states` RPM package, where `xx` is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version number.

1. To launch the worker, register it in the `postgresql.conf` file using the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter. For example:

  ```ini
  shared_preload_libraries = '$libdir/edb_wait_states'
  ```

1.  Restart the database server. After a successful restart, the background worker begins collecting data.

1. To review the data, create the following extension:

  ```sql
  CREATE EXTENSION edb_wait_states;
  ```

1. To terminate the EDB wait states worker, remove `$libdir/edb_wait_states` from the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter, and restart the database server.

To install EWSBW on a Windows system:

1.  To install the EDB wait states module with the `EDB Modules` installer, invoke the StackBuilder Plus utility. Follow the onscreen instructions to finish installing the `EDB Modules`.

1. To register the worker, modify the `postgresql.conf` file to include the wait states library in the `shared_preload_libraries` configuration parameter. The parameter value must include:

  ```ini
  shared_preload_libraries = '$libdir/edb_wait_states.dll'
  ```

  The EDB wait states installation places the `edb_wait_states.dll` library file in the following path:

  ```text
  C:\Program Files\edb\as14\lib\
  ```

1. Restart the database server to make the changes take effect. After a successful restart, the background worker starts and begins collecting the data.

1. To view the data, create the following extension:

   ```sql
   CREATE EXTENSION edb_wait_states;
   ```

The installer places the `edb_wait_states.control` file in the following path:

```text
C:\Program Files\edb\as14\share\extension
```

### Terminating the wait states worker

To terminate the EDB wait states worker:

1.  Use the `DROP EXTENSION` command to drop the `edb_wait_states` extension. 
1.  Modify the `postgresql.conf` file, removing `$libdir/edb_wait_states.dll` from the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter. 
1.  To apply your changes, restart the database server.

### The wait states interface

Each of the functions in the interface has common input and output parameters. Those parameters are:

-   **start_ts and end_ts (IN).** Together these specify the time interval and the data to read. If you specify only `start_ts`, the data starting from `start_ts` is output. If you specify only `end_ts`, data up to `end_ts` is output. If you don't specify either, all the data is output. 
-   **query_id (OUT).** Identifies a normalized query. It's internal hash code computed from the query.
-   **session_id (OUT).** Identifies a session.
-   **ref_start_ts and ref_end_ts (OUT).** Provides the timestamps of a file containing a particular data point. A data point might be a wait event sample record, a query record, or a session record.

The examples that follow are based on the following three queries. They are executed simultaneously on four different sessions connected to different databases using different users:

```sql
SELECT schemaname FROM pg_tables, pg_sleep(15) WHERE schemaname <>
'pg_catalog'; /* ran on 2 sessions */
SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables, pg_sleep(10) WHERE schemaname <>
'pg_catalog';
SELECT tablename, schemaname FROM pg_tables, pg_sleep(10) WHERE schemaname
<> 'pg_catalog';
```

## edb_wait_states_data

Use this function to read the data collected by EWSBW:

```sql
edb_wait_states_data(
  IN start_ts timestamptz default '-infinity'::timestamptz,
  IN end_ts timestamptz default 'infinity'::timestamptz,
  OUT session_id int4,
  OUT <dbname> text,
  OUT <username> text,
  OUT <query> text,
  OUT <query_start_time> timestamptz,
  OUT <sample_time> timestamptz,
  OUT <wait_event_type> text,
  OUT <wait_event> text
)
```

You can use this function to find out the following:

-  The queries running in the given duration (defined by `start_ts` and `end_ts`) in all the sessions, and the wait events, if any, they were waiting on. For example:

  ```sql
  SELECT query, session_id, wait_event_type, wait_event
    FROM edb_wait_states_data(start_ts, end_ts);
  ```

-  The progress of a session within a given duration, that is, the queries run in a session (`session_id = 100000`) and the wait events the queries waited on. For example:

  ```sql
  SELECT query, wait_event_type, wait_event
    FROM edb_wait_states_data(start_ts, end_ts)
    WHERE session_id = 100000;
  ```

-  The duration for which the samples are available. For example:

  ```sql
  SELECT min(sample_time), max(sample_time)
    FROM edb_wait_states_data();
  ```

### Parameters

In addition to the common parameters described previously, each row of the output gives the following:

`dbname`

The session's database.

`username`

The session's logged-in user.

`query`

The query running in the session.

`query_start_time`

The time when the query started.

`sample_time`

The time when wait event data was collected.

`wait_event_type`

The type of wait event the session (backend) is waiting on.

`wait_event`

The wait event the session (backend) is waiting on.

### Example

The following is a sample output from the `edb_wait_states_data()` function:

```sql
edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_wait_states_data();
__OUTPUT__
-[ RECORD 1 ]----+-------------------------------------------------------------------------
session_id       | 4398
dbname           | edb

                    .
                    .
                    .
```

## edb_wait_states_queries

This function gives information about the queries sampled by EWSBW.

```sql
edb_wait_states_queries(
  IN start_ts timestamptz default '-infinity'::timestamptz,
  IN end_ts timestamptz default 'infinity'::timestamptz,
  OUT query_id int8,
  OUT <query> text,
  OUT ref_start_ts timestamptz
  OUT ref_end_ts timestamptz
)
```

A new queries file is created periodically. Multiple query files can be generated corresponding to specific intervals.

This function returns all the queries in query files that overlap with the given time interval. A query gives all the queries in query files that contained queries sampled between `start_ts` and `end_ts`:

```sql
SELECT query FROM edb_wait_states_queries(start_ts, end_ts);
```

In other words, the function can output queries that didn't run in the given interval. To do that, use `edb_wait_states_data()`.

### Parameters

In addition to the common parameters described previously, each row of the output gives the following:

`query`

Normalized query text.

### Example

The following is a sample output from the `edb_wait_states_queries()` function:

```sql
edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_wait_states_queries();
__OUTPUT__
-[ RECORD 1 ]+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
query_id     | 4292540138852956818
query        | SELECT schemaname FROM pg_tables, pg_sleep($1) WHERE schemaname <> $2
ref_start_ts | 17-AUG-18 11:52:38.698793 -04:00
ref_end_ts   | 18-AUG-18 11:52:38.698793 -04:00
-[ RECORD 2 ]+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
query_id     | 3754591102365859187

ref_start_ts | 17-AUG-18 11:52:38.698793 -04:00
ref_end_ts   | 18-AUG-18 11:52:38.698793 -04:00
-[ RECORD 3 ]+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
query_id     | 349089096300352897
query        | SELECT tablename, schemaname FROM pg_tables, pg_sleep($1) WHERE schemaname <> $2
ref_start_ts | 17-AUG-18 11:52:38.698793 -04:00
ref_end_ts   | 18-AUG-18 11:52:38.698793 -04:00
```

## edb_wait_states_sessions

This function gives information about the sessions sampled by EWSBW:

```sql
edb_wait_states_sessions(
  IN start_ts timestamptz default '-infinity'::timestamptz,
  IN end_ts timestamptz default 'infinity'::timestamptz,
  OUT session_id int4,
  OUT <dbname> text,
  OUT <username> text,
  OUT ref_start_ts timestamptz
  OUT ref_end_ts timestamptz
)
```

You can use this function to identify the databases that were connected and the users that started those sessions. For example:

```sql
SELECT dbname, username, session_id
  FROM edb_wait_states_sessions();
```

Similar to `edb_wait_states_queries()`, this function outputs all the sessions logged in session files that contain sessions sampled in the given interval. It doesn't necessarily output only the sessions sampled in the given interval. To identify that, use `edb_wait_states_data()`.

### Parameters

In addition to the common parameters described previously, each row of the output gives the following:

`dbname`

The database to which the session is connected.

`username`

Login user of the session.

### Example

The following is a sample output from the `edb_wait_states_sessions()` function:

```sql
edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_wait_states_sessions();
__OUTPUT__
-[ RECORD 1 ]+---------------------------------
session_id   | 4340
dbname       | edb
username     | enterprisedb
ref_start_ts | 17-AUG-18 11:52:38.698793 -04:00
ref_end_ts   | 18-AUG-18 11:52:38.698793 -04:00

ref_end_ts   | 18-AUG-18 11:52:38.698793 -04:00
```

## edb_wait_states_samples

This function gives information about wait events sampled by EWSBW:

```sql
edb_wait_states_samples(
  IN start_ts timestamptz default '-infinity'::timestamptz,
  IN end_ts timestamptz default 'infinity'::timestamptz,
  OUT query_id int8,
  OUT session_id int4,
  OUT <query_start_time> timestamptz,
  OUT <sample_time> timestamptz,
  OUT <wait_event_type> text,
  OUT <wait_event> text
)
```

Usually, you don't need to call this function directly.

### Parameters

In addition to the common parameters described previously, each row of the output gives the following:

`query_start_time`

The time when the query started in this session.

`sample_time`

The time when wait event data was collected.

`wait_event_type`

The type of wait event on which the session is waiting.

`wait_event`

The wait event on which the session (backend) is waiting.

### Example

The following is a sample output from the `edb_wait_states_samples()` function:

```sql
edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_wait_states_samples();
__OUTPUT__
-[ RECORD 1 ]----+---------------------------------
query_id         | 4292540138852956818

                    .
                    .
                    .
```

## edb_wait_states_purge

The function deletes all the sampled data files (queries, sessions, and wait-event samples) that were created after `start_ts` and aged (rotated) before `end_ts`:

```sql
edb_wait_states_purge(
  IN start_ts timestamptz default '-infinity'::timestamptz,
  IN end_ts timestamptz default 'infinity'::timestamptz
)
```

Usually you don't need to run this function. The backend usually purges those according to the retention age. However, if that doesn't happen for some reason, you can use this function.

To find out how long the samples were retained, use `edb_wait_states_data()`.

### Example

This code shows the `$PGDATA/edb_wait_states` directory before running `edb_wait_states_purge()`:

```shell
[root@localhost data]# pwd
/var/lib/edb/as14/data
[root@localhost data]# ls -l edb_wait_states
total 12
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb ...  253 Aug 17 11:56 edb_ws_queries_587836358698793_587922758698793
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb ... 1600 Aug 17 11:56 edb_ws_samples_587836358698793_587839958698793
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb ...   94 Aug 17 11:56 edb_ws_sessions_587836358698793_587922758698793
```

This code shows the `$PGDATA/edb_wait_states` directory after running `edb_wait_states_purge()`:

```sql
edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_wait_states_purge();
__OUTPUT__
 edb_wait_states_purge
-----------------------

(1 row)
```
```shell
[root@localhost data]# pwd
/var/lib/edb/as14/data
[root@localhost data]# ls -l edb_wait_states
total 0
```
