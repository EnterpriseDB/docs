PG Squeeze (`pg_squeeze`) is an extension released as open source software under the PostgreSQL License. 

`pg_squeeze` removes unused space from a table and optionally sorts tuples according to a particular index (as if a `CLUSTER` command were executed concurrently with regular reads and writes). In fact, `pg_squeeze` tries to replace the `pg_repack` extension. While providing very similar functionality, `pg_squeeze` takes a different approach by:

- Implementing functionality solely on the server side. This approach makes both configuration and use simpler than `pg_repack`, which uses both server- and client-side code. Server-side implementation also allows for smooth implementation of unattended processing using background workers.

- Using recent improvements of the PostgreSQL database server. Most notably, besides the use of background workers, `pg_squeeze` uses logical decode instead of triggers to capture concurrent changes.
