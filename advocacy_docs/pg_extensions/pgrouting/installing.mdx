pgRouting is supported on the same platforms as the Postgres distribution you're using. Support for pgRouting starts with Postgres 13. For details, see:

- [EDB Postgres Advanced Server Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#epas)
- [PostgreSQL Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#pg)
- [EDB Postgres Extended Server Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#epas_extended)

## Installation

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install Postgres. See: 

  - [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/installing/)

  - [Installing PostgreSQL](../../supported-open-source/postgresql/installing/) 

  - [Installing EDB Postgres Extended Server](/pge/latest/installing/)

- Set up the repository.

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you've already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

## Install the package

The syntax for the package install command is:

```shell
# For SLES, CentOS, RHEL and its derivatives
sudo <package-manager> -y install edb-<postgres><postgres_version>-pgRouting0

# For Debian and Ubuntu
sudo <package-manager> -y install edb-<postgres><postgres_version>-pgRouting-0
```

Where: 
- `<package-manager>`is the package manager used with your operating system:

  | Package manager |             Operating system     |
  | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | dnf             | RHEL 8/9 and derivatives         |
  | yum             | RHEL 7 and derivatives, CentOS 7 |
  | zypper          | SLES                             |
  | apt-get         | Debian and derivatives           |

- `<postgres>` is the distribution of Postgres you're using:

 |    Postgres distribution     |   Value    |
 | ---------------------------- | ---------- |
 | PostgreSQL                   | pg         |
 | EDB Postgres Advanced Server | as         |
 | EDB Postgres Extended Server | postgresextended |

- `<postgres_version>` is the version of Postgres you're using.

For example, to install pgRouting for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 15 on a RHEL 8 platform:

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-as15-pgRouting0
```
