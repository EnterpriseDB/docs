EDB Query Advisor defines functions and views.

## Functions

### query_advisor_index_recommendations(min_filter, min_selectivity)
This function performs a global index suggestion. 

By default, only predicates filtering at least 1000 rows and 30% of the rows in average are considered. You can use the `min_filter` and `min_selectivity` parameters to override the default. 

The function generates the one- and two-column index candidates based on the predicates it collects. It replans all related workload queries in the presence of the hypothetical index with respect to each candidate. It recommends the list of indexes that bring the most value to the workload. It also shows the estimated index size and percentage cost reduction in the workload queries. You can decide, based on the size and benefit ratio, which indexes are the most useful for you.

For example:

```sql
# running as postgres user
select * from query_advisor_index_recommendations(0,0);
__OUTPUT__
|                             index                             | estimated_size_in_bytes | estimated_pct_cost_reduction |
+---------------------------------------------------------------+-------------------------+------------------------------+
| CREATE INDEX ON nation USING btree (n_name);                  | 8192                    | 14.619857                    |
| CREATE INDEX ON supplier USING btree (s_suppkey,s_nationkey); | 933888                  | 0.63003576                   |
| CREATE INDEX ON partsupp USING btree (ps_suppkey);            | 50159616                | 13.254544                    |

### query_advisor_qualstat
This function returns the counts for every qualifier identified by the expression hash. This hash identifies each expression.

### query_advisor_workload_queries
Returns all the stored query texts.

### query_advisor_qualstats_memory_usage
Returns the percentage usage of the workload and qualifier hash table.

### query_advisor_qualstats_reset
Resets the internal counters and forgets about every encountered qualifier and workload entry.

## Views
The extension defines the following views on top of the `pg_qualstats` function. 

### query_advisor_qualstat
Filters calls to `query_advisor_qualstats()` by the current database.

### query_advisor_qualstats_pretty
Performs the appropriate joins to display a readable, aggregated form for every attribute from the query_advisor_qualstats view.

For example:

```
# running as ro user

select * from query_advisor_qualstats_pretty;
__OUTPUT__
 left_schema |    left_table    | left_column |   operator   | right_schema | right_table | right_column | occurrences | execution_count | nbfiltered
