This landing page covers vector and lexical indexing options available for Postgres in EDB‑supported distributions. It links to installation, configuration, and usage guides for each option.

## Vector indexes

EDB supports two vector index options that use the `vector` data type introduced by the `pgvector` extension:

- pgvector: Standard HNSW and IVF index types for approximate nearest‑neighbor search.
  - [pgvector overview](./pgvector/index.mdx)
  - [Installing pgvector](./pgvector/installing.mdx)
  - [Configuring pgvector](./pgvector/configuring.mdx)
  - [Using pgvector](./pgvector/using.mdx)

- VectorChord: Adds the IVF‑RaBitQ (`vchordq`) index implementation, tuned for large datasets, low‑latency queries, and higher‑dimension embeddings.

  - [Installing VectorChord](./vectorchord/installing.mdx)
  - [Using VectorChord](./vectorchord/using.mdx)

## Lexical search

Lexical search support is provided via the VectorChord‑BM25 extension with a supporting `pg_tokenizer` extension.

## Compare and choose

- pgvector (HNSW/IVF): Standard ANN indexes with broad community adoption.
  - Choose when: embedding dimensions are moderate, dataset sizes are typical, or you want the most widely recognized operators and examples.
  - Strengths: Simple setup; well‑known behavior; good default for many RAG/similarity use cases.

- VectorChord (IVF‑RaBitQ): Vector index engineered for scale and latency.
  - Choose when: you operate on very large corpora, need lower query latencies, or use higher‑dimension embeddings that stress standard indexes.
  - Strengths: Fast top‑k retrieval at scale; supports larger vector dimensions; compatible with the `vector` data type.

- VectorChord‑BM25 (lexical): High‑quality keyword ranking with BM25; great for pure text relevance or hybrid retrieval with vectors.
  - Choose when: keywords matter, queries are short, or you want to mix lexical and semantic signals.
  - Strengths: Corpus‑aware ranking (IDF, length normalization) and efficient top‑k retrieval.

Typical patterns

- Pure semantic: Vector index only (pgvector or VectorChord) for ANN nearest‑neighbor search.
- Pure lexical: VectorChord‑BM25 for keyword relevance ranking.
- Hybrid: Combine vector similarity with BM25 (for example, score fusion or staged retrieval).

## Packaging and provenance

- Packaging: EDB builds and signs pgvector, VectorChord, and VectorChord‑BM25 packages for supported platforms and publishes them via the EDB repositories. See downloads and repo setup at https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres
- Provenance: Each package build records the upstream source it was built from. You can inspect the package changelog to see the upstream repository reference and commit.
  - RPM‑based: `rpm -q --changelog <package>` or `dnf info <package>`
  - Debian/Ubuntu: `apt changelog <package>` or `apt show <package>`
- Verification: Packages are signed with EDB’s GPG key as part of the repository configuration.

<!-- TODOs:
 - Add final links to VectorChord documentation once published.
 - Add install guides for VectorChord and pg_tokenizer packages as they become available.
