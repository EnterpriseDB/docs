## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

  - [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/installing/)

  - [Installing PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) 

  - [Installing EDB Postgres Extended Server](/pge/latest/installing/)

- Set up the repository.

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you've already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads), and follow the instructions provided there.

## Install the package

The syntax for the RPM package install command is:

```shell
sudo <package-manager> -y install pg-<postgres><postgres_version>-pg-failover-slots<major_version>
```

The syntax for the Debian package install command is:

```shell
sudo <package-manager> -y install pg-<postgres><postgres_version>-pg-failover-slots-<major_version>
```

Where: 
- `<package-manager>`is the package manager used with your operating system:

  | Package manager |             Operating system     |
  | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | dnf             | RHEL 8 and derivatives           |

  | zypper          | SLES                             |
  | apt-get         | Debian and derivatives           |

- `<postgres>` is the distribution of Postgres you're using:

 |    Postgres distribution     |   Value    |
 | ---------------------------- | ---------- |
 | PostgreSQL                   | pg         |
 | EDB Postgres Advanced Server | as         |
 | EDB Postgres Extended        | postgresextended |

- `<postgres_version>` is the version of Postgres you're using.

- `<major_version>` is the major version of PG Failover Slots you're installing.

```

To install PG Failover Slots 1.0.0 for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 15 on a Debian 11 platform:
