## The Global Temporary table crashes with pgtt extension on EPAS

**Scenario**

The `pgtt` extension is incompatible with `default_with_rowids=on`. When this GUC is enabled (as is the default in EPAS), any attempt by `pgtt` to create a temporary table fails due to a conflict with the implicit `rowid` system column, resulting in errors such as:

```
ERROR: column name "rowid" conflicts with a system column name
```

Worse, once a corrupted entry is created in `pgtt_schema.pg_global_temp_tables` (with a NULL `preserved` value), any subsequent `LOAD 'pgtt'` invocation crashes the server due to a NULL dereference in `text_to_cstring()`.

**Workaround/Recommendation:**

Disable `default_with_rowids` before using the `pgtt` extension:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET default_with_rowids = off;
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```
