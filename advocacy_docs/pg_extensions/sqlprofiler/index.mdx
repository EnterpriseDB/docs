SQL Profiler is a tool that allows you to track execution statistics of all SQL statements executed on a server by specific user(s) and on specific database(s). Its primary purpose is to capture SQL statements sent to a Postgres server to help a DBA analyze a set of SQL traffic, identifying the most resource-intensive SQL statements, locating SQL bottlenecks in their system, and assisting the DBA in tuning problematic SQL code to increase overall server performance.
