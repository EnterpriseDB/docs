SQL Profiler is a tool that allows you to track execution statistics of all SQL statements executed on a server by specific users and on specific databases. Its primary purpose is to capture SQL statements sent to a Postgres server to help a DBA analyze a set of SQL traffic and:

-  Identify the most resource-intensive SQL statements.
-  Locate SQL bottlenecks in their system.
-  Help to tune problematic SQL code to increase overall server performance.
