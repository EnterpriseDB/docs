navTitle: Configuring SQL Server dbo Schema
---
Prior to Advanced Server 11, a system catalog named dbo was available. The dbo
system catalog contained views of database objects for similarity with Microsoft® SQL
Server®.
Now, for Advanced Server neither the dbo system catalog nor a schema named dbo exist
in any database.

If it is desired to have such a schema with its SQL Server compatible views, use the
`CREATE EXTENSION edb_dbo` command to create the dbo schema and its content.
The following example shows the creation of the dbo schema and its views:
```sql
edb=# CREATE EXTENSION edb_dbo;
CREATE EXTENSION
edb=# \dn
 List of schemas
 Name | Owner
--------+--------------
dbo | enterprisedb
public | enterprisedb
(2 rows)
edb=# SET search_path TO dbo;
SET
edb=# \dv
 List of relations
Schema | Name | Type | Owner
--------+------------+------+--------------
```
