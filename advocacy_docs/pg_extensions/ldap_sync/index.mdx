EDB LDAP Sync is a collection of utilities and configurations for synchronizing Postgres with directory servers that support the LDAP protocol, such as OpenLDAP and Active Directory. Database administrators can schedule ldap2pg to synchronize Postgres users and groups with LDAP users and groups. EDB LDAP Sync replaces external schedulers, like cron, while using a similar syntax.
