navTitle: Configuring
---

EDB LDAP Sync is a collection of tools that synchronize credentials from an LDAP or Active Directory server to EDB Postgres Advanced Server. We recommend that you configure its tools in the following ways.

Find the sample EDB LDAP Sync configuration files at `/usr/lib/python3.6/site-packages/ldap_sync/samples/`.

## Configure pgAgent

pgAgent sets up periodic synchronization tasks. Use `edb-pgagent.conf_tmpl` as the default configuration for pgAgent setup with Postgres. Copy it into the configuration directory for pgAgent with Postgres. 

For more information, see the [pgAgent documentation](/docs/pem/latest/pem_online_help/10_pgagent/).

## Setting Postgres database permissions

You need to modify the permission settings for the database server to allow Postgres to query the LDAP host during Postgres authentication. You can do this by updating `pg_hba.conf` in the configuration folder of the database server. For EDB Postgres Advanced Server configuration, `pg_hba.conf` is located in `/opt/postgres/data/pg_hba.conf`.

### `pg_hba.conf` settings

!!! Note
The user varies depending on your database service. PostgreSQL has a `postgres` user. EDB Postgres Advanced Server has an `enterprisedb` user. 
!!!

When configuring `pg_hba.conf`, the LDAP authentication string must come after the `enterprisedb` user authentication string. Otherwise, due to the order of evaluation, the `enterprisedb` user can't log into the system. For example, LDAP server is queried instead of local authentication, LDAP server returns an authentication failure, and the authentication process terminates. For this reason, you need to add host authentication for the `enterprisedb` user if you want to use host authentication as a part of the ldap2pg setup. 

The following authentication methods are available: peer, host with a password string by way of `dsn` option, and host by way of reading `.pgpass`. See [Configure ldap2pg](#configure-ldap2pg) for more information. 

The Postgres database permissions are set according to your database requirements. The following are sample `pg_hba.conf` stanzas for LDAP authentication queries, where the values in `{}` are the LDAP server hostname and the basedn LDAP query string: 

```text
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
local   all             enterprisedb                            peer
host    all             enterprisedb    127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
host    all             enterprisedb    ::1/128                 scram-sha-256
host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0               ldap ldapserver="{{ldap host/ip}}" ldapbasedn="{{basedn}}" ldapsearchattribute=uid  ldaptls=0  ldapport=389
# Other authentication strings
.
.
.
# End of the file / add ldap SSL connection here
hostssl all             all             0.0.0.0/0 ldap ldapserver="{{ldap host/ip}}" ldapbasedn="dc={{basedn}}" ldapsearchattribute=uid  ldaptls=0  ldapport=389
```

The following is a sample `pg_hba.conf` file for EDB Postgres Advanced Server without any modifications:

```text
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
local   all             enterprisedb                            peer
local   replication     all                                     peer
local   all             all                                     peer
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
host    all             all             ::1/128                 scram-sha-256
host    replication     all             127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
host    replication     all             ::1/128                 scram-sha-256
# node1
hostssl all all 10.10.0.5/32 scram-sha-256
hostssl replication all 10.10.0.5/32 scram-sha-256
# ldap

hostssl all all 0.0.0.0/0 scram-sha-256
```

The following is a sample `pg_hba.conf` with the initial configuration and LDAP authentication:

```text
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
local   all             enterprisedb                            peer
host    all             enterprisedb    127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
host    all             enterprisedb    ::1/128                 scram-sha-256
host    all             all             0.0.0.0/0               ldap ldapserver="ldap" ldapbasedn="dc=planetexpress,dc=com" ldapsearchattribute=uid  ldaptls=0  ldapport=10389
local   replication     all                                     peer
local   all             all                                     peer
host    all             all             127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
host    all             all             ::1/128                 scram-sha-256
host    replication     all             127.0.0.1/32            scram-sha-256
host    replication     all             ::1/128                 scram-sha-256
# node1
hostssl all all 172.17.0.2/32 scram-sha-256
hostssl replication all 172.17.0.2/32 scram-sha-256
# ldap
hostssl all all 0.0.0.0/0 ldap ldapserver="ldap" ldapbasedn="dc=planetexpress,dc=com" ldapsearchattribute=uid  ldaptls=0  ldapport=10389
```

After setting `pg_hab.conf`, reload the configuration to apply the changes with the Postgres shell or the `systemctl`: 

```sql
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

```shell
systemctl restart postgres
```

## Configure ldap2pg

ldap2pg is a PostgreSQL role and access control list (ACL) management tool. Find the `ldap2pg.yml` in its default location in the `/etc/` folder. For more information on ldap2pg, see the [ldpa2pg documentation](https://ldap2pg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 

Install the ldap2pg tool with the following command:

```shell
yum install python3-ldap2pg
```

For synchronization to work, you need to set the following sections in the configuration file:
<!-- Should set be setup? -->

- `ldap` 

- `postgres`

- `sync_map`

### Verify LDAP server connection

Before configuring ldap2pg, check that the connection string works. For LDAP servers, you can check if the database server can communicate with the LDAP server by installing the `openldap-clients` package: 

```shell
$ yum install -y openldap-clients
```

Test the connection from the database server to the LDAP server with the `ldapsearch` command:

```shell
$   ldapsearch -H ldap://ldap_server:389 -x -b "<ldap query string>" \
        -D "<admin query string>" -w <admin password> \
        uid=alphanum_user_id
```

A sample search string looks like this: 

```shell
$ ldapsearch -H ldap://ldap:10389 -x -b "ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com" \
        -D "cn=admin,dc=planetexpress,dc=com" -w GoodNewsEveryone \
        uid=professor
```

A successful request returns an LDAP object definition as a plain-text response like the following:

```text 
# extended LDIF
#
# LDAPv3
# base <ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com> with scope subtree
# filter: uid=professor
# requesting: ALL
#

# Hubert J. Farnsworth, people, planetexpress.com
dn: cn=Hubert J. Farnsworth,ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com
objectClass: inetOrgPerson
objectClass: organizationalPerson
objectClass: person
objectClass: top
cn: Hubert J. Farnsworth
```

### `ldap`

<!-- There should be some sort of intro text rather than going right from a heading 3 to heading 4 -->

#### OpenLDAP configuration

For servers that allow anonymous connections, the LDAP configuration requires a LDAP server url and port. For servers that need authentication, you must provide `password` and `binddn` queries. To do this, `binddn` must have permission to perform user lookups.

The default port for LDAP is 389:

```yaml
ldap:
  uri: ldap://ldap:389
```

#### Active Directory configuration 

The Active Directory setup requires a `binddn`, `password`, and `uri` with permission to read user information. 

```yaml
ldap:
  binddn: cn=ldap2pg,ou=postgresql,dc=edb,dc=com
  password: EDBad32
  uri: ldap://10.100.20.21:389
```

### `postgres`

The Postgres configuration contains the PostgreSQL database settings, such as authentication and the specifics of schemas and queries, which populate user information. 

You can perform database authentication with the `dsn` string, which supports any authentication methods available in libpq. 

#### Peer authentication 

To use peer authentication for EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you need to list only the database name under `dbanme`. Enter the following string:

```yaml
dsn: dbname=postgres
```

To run the sync of ldap2pg as a default peer user for EDB Postgres Advanced Server, set the file permission for `/etc/ldap2pg.yml` to the local database user. For example: 

```shell
$ chown enterprisedb:enterprisedb /etc/ldap2pg.yml
```

Pass a `-v` parameter to verify that the user sync process for ldap2pg on the database server runs:

```shell
$ ldap2pg -v
```

#### Using Pgpass

EDB Postgres Advanced Server creates the `.pgpass` authentication file in `/var/lib/edb/` with the default user `enterprisedb`. If you plan to run synchronization jobs as the `enterprisedb` user, it's easier to use peer authentication. 

This case examines the scenario where EDB Postgres Advanced Server authentication is performed with the `enterprisedb` user but the sync job for ldap2pg is run as a different user.

Copy `.pgpass` from the `enterprisedb` user home directory:

```shell
$ sudo cp /var/lib/edb/.pgpass ~/
```

Modify the `dsn` variable in the `postgres` section in `/etc/ldap2pg.yaml`:

```yaml
dsn: host=localhost user=enterprisedb dbname=postgres
```

#### OpenLDAP configuration 

This is a sample configuration for synchronizing the PostgreSQL user accounts with OpenLDAP.

`dsn` &mdash; A Postgres URI string that uses the username:password authentication method.

`databases_query` &mdash; Specifies the Postgres database that contains the user records.

`schemas_query` &mdash; Returns all schemas in pg_catalog to be available to ldap2pg. 

`roles_blacklist_query` &mdash; Excludes tables from synchronization operations, in particular anything related to EDB Postgres Advanced Server or internal Postgres tables.

```yaml
postgres:
  dsn: postgres://enterprisedb:LOCALPASS@localhost:5444/postgres
  databases_query: [postgres]
  schemas_query: "SELECT nspname FROM pg_catalog"
  roles_blacklist_query: [aq_administrator_role, pg_*]
  ```

#### Active Directory configuration

This is a sample configuration for synchronizing the PostgreSQL user accounts with Active Directory.

`dsn` &mdash; A Postgres URI string that uses the username:password authentication method.
`managed_roles_query` &mdash; Query to restrict role deletion and privilege edition to specific roles.
`owners_query` &mdash; Specifies a global list of owners common to all databases and schemas.
`schemas_query` &mdash; Specifies owners for schemas so that ldap2pg can be aware of the schemas in each database.

```yaml
postgres:
  dsn: postgres://enterprisedb:LOCALPASS@localhost:5444/postgres
  managed_roles_query: |
    SELECT 'public'
    UNION
    SELECT DISTINCT role.rolname
    FROM pg_roles AS role
    LEFT OUTER JOIN pg_auth_members AS ms ON ms.member = role.oid
    LEFT OUTER JOIN pg_roles AS ldap_roles
      ON ldap_roles.rolname = 'ldap_roles' AND ldap_roles.oid = ms.roleid
    WHERE role.rolname IN ('ldap_roles', 'readers', 'writers', 'owners')
        OR ldap_roles.oid IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY 1;
  owners_query: |
    SELECT DISTINCT role.rolname
    FROM pg_catalog.pg_roles AS role
    JOIN pg_catalog.pg_auth_members AS ms ON ms.member = role.oid
    JOIN pg_catalog.pg_roles AS owners
      ON owners.rolname = 'owners' AND owners.oid = ms.roleid
    ORDER BY 1;
  schemas_query: |
    SELECT nspname FROM pg_catalog.pg_namespace
    WHERE nspname NOT LIKE 'pg_%' AND nspname <> 'information_schema'
    ORDER BY 1;
```

### `sync_map`

Each `sync_map` item is called a *mapping*. A mapping is a YAML dictionary with a `description` field and any of `ldapsearch`, `role`, and `grant subsection`. 

#### Roles

Define one or more roles that target the PostgreSQL cluster. Specify the roles under selected LDAP accounts that are imported and the permissions they use. 

A value can be a single role or a list. This example is a sample definition of roles under `sync_map`:

```yaml
roles:
  - names:
    - ldap_roles
    - readers
    options: NOLOGIN
  - name: writers
    # Grant reading to writers
    parent: readers
    options: NOLOGIN
  - name: owners
    # Grant read/write to owners
    parent: writers
    options: NOLOGIN
```

This example is a simple definition of a single role with `LOGIN` and `SUPERUSER` privileges applied to every user authenticated with LDAP:

```yaml
role:
    name: '{uid}'
    options: LOGIN SUPERUSER
```

#### Grant

The `grant` section defines grant privilege to a role with the corresponding parameters. In other words, this section determines the privileges granted for a role defined in the `roles` section. 

```yaml
  grant:
  - privilege: ro
    role: readers
    schemas: __all__
  - privilege: rw
    role: writers
    schema: __all__
  - privilege: ddl
    role: owners
    schema: __all__
```

#### ldapsearch query and filters

The `ldapsearch` section specifies the search queries needed to identify the LDAP accounts that you can synchronize with PostgreSQL. For example:


```yaml
 ldapsearch:
    base: ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com
    binddn: ou=people,dc=planetexpress,dc=com
    filter: "(objectClass=inetOrgPerson)"

```

#### Role statement

The `role` section defines the user accounts and options that can be mapped in the PostgreSQL database. The default name parameter for each user record is `cn`, which is the account’s full name. The `uid` name is instead specified, which is a short username. 
<!-- The original was hard to follow. Please verify this is correct. -->

```yaml
role:
    name: '{uid}'
    options: LOGIN SUPERUSER
```

## Set a synchronization schedule

`schedule_pgagent` sets up a synchronization schedule for ldap2pg. This utility uses syntax similar to cron and produces the SQL command `pgagent.sql`, which is loaded into the database. 

This example creates a schedule that runs every hour: 

```shell
schedule_pgagent "0 * * * *"
```

This command produces the  `pgagent.sql` file, which is loaded into the database with `enterprisedb` user credentials: 

```shell
psql < pgagent.sql
```
