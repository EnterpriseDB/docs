EDB LDAP Sync is supported on the same platforms as the Postgres distribution you're using. Support for EDB LDAP Sync starts with Postgres 11. See:
- [EDB Postgres Advanced Server Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#epas)

- [PostgreSQL Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#pg)
- [EDB Postgres Extended Server Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#epas_extended)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install Postgres. See:
  - [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/installing/)

  - [Installing PostgreSQL](../../supported-open-source/postgresql/installing/) 

  - [Installing EDB Postgres Extended Server](/pge/latest/installing/)

- Install [pg_cron](https://github.com/citusdata/pg_cron)

- Install the [plpython3u](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/plpython.html) procedural language to run ldap2pg. 

!!! Note
plpython3u is an "untrusted" language and thus a potential security risk.
!!!

- Install [ldap2pg](https://ldap2pg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

- Set up the repository.

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.


## Install the package

The syntax for the RPM package install command is:

```shell
sudo <package-manager> -y install edb-ldap-sync<major_version>
```

The syntax for the Debian package install command is:

```shell
sudo <package-manager> -y install edb-ldap-sync-<major_version>
```

Where:

- `<package-manager>`is the package manager used with your operating system:

| Package manager |             Operating system     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| dnf             | RHEL 8/9 and derivatives           |
| yum             | RHEL 7 and derivatives, CentOS 7 |
| zypper          | SLES                             |
| apt-get         | Debian and derivatives           |

- `<major_version>` is the major version of EDB LDAP Sync you're installing. 

For example, to install EDB LDAP Sync version 1.0.0 on a RHEL 8 platform:

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-ldap-sync1
```

To install EDB LDAP Sync version 1.0.0 on a Debian 11 platform:

```shell
sudo apt-get -y install edb-ldap-sync-1
```
