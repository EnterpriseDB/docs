EDB LDAP Sync is supported on the same platforms as the Postgres distribution you are using. Support for EDB LDAP Sync starts with Postgres 11. See:
- [EDB Postgres Advanced Server Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#epas)

- [PostgreSQL Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#pg)
- [EDB Postgres Distributed (includes EDB Postgres Extended)](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#bdr)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install Postgres
  - [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux/installing_epas_using_edb_repository/)

  - [Installing PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/) 

  - [Installing EDB Postgres Distributed (includes EDB Postgres Extended)](/pgd/latest/deployments/tpaexec/)

- Install [ldap2pg](https://ldap2pg.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.


## Install the package

The syntax for the RPM package install command is:

```shell
sudo <package-manager> -y install edb-ldap-sync<major_version>-<full_version>
```

And the syntax for the Debian package install command is:

```shell
sudo <package-manager> -y install edb-ldap-sync-<major_version>-<full_version>
```

where:

- `<package-manager>`is the package manager used with your operating system:

| Package manager |             Operating system     |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| dnf             | RHEL 8 and derivatives           |
| yum             | RHEL 7 and derivatives, CentOS 7 |
| zypper          | SLES                             |
| apt-get         | Debian and derivatives           |

- `<major_version>` is the major version of the extension you are installing. 

- `<full_version>` is the full version of the extension you are installing.

For example, to install EDB LDAP Sync version 1.0.0 on a RHEL 8 platform:

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-ldap-sync1-1.0.0
```

And to install EDB LDAP Sync version 1.0.0 on a Debian 11 platform:

```shell
sudo apt-get -y install edb-ldap-sync-1-1.0.0
```
