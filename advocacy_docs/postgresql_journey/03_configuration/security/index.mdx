In this series of guides, we'll examine the security of your PostgreSQL implementation from the client perspective through to the on-disk storage. In all aspects of this journey there are options that are appropriate for one deployment and other options that are appropriate for others â€” as well as additional functionality that should be considered such as [sepgsql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sepgsql.html), which can work with SELinux, and could take an entire blog series to describe on its own!

Hopefully these posts are helpful in reviewing the security of your deployments, but do remember that each deployment scenario is unique and the suggestions made here are not a "one size fits all" solution.
