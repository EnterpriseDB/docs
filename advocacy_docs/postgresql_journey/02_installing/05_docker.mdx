Docker containers are an environment which exist and run independently from whatever else is running on a given machine. Containers are created from "images", which define what a given environment will look like - file system layout, running processes, etc. This makes them very convenient for side-stepping the whole "installation" problem: an image in which the necessary software has already been installed and configured can be distributed and used to create containers on any machine with Docker available.

## Creating a container from an official image

Let's start by spinning up a local PostgreSQL server using one of the images available on the public Docker Hub repository: <https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres>

Make sure you have Docker installed. If not, install it using [the instructions on the Docker website](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/).

Alternately, you can follow these steps in your browser: <KatacodaPanel />

1.  Retrieve the PostgreSQL image from the Docker Hub repository (if not already cached) and run it:

    ```shell
    docker run --name test_postgres -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password -e POSTGRES_DB=testdb -d postgres
    __OUTPUT__
    3cf208bf260dd3714bba84ec606b6a7bd92b34466fc159a17b5a12596d96e86c
    ```

     The output will be the container ID of the newly-running container, a [UUID](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier) that distinguishes it from other running containers. **This will be different each time the container is started,** so we also passed the `--name` option to give us something consistent to refer to in the examples that follow.

    The postgres image has PostgreSQL installed, but no database initialized. During startup, the default database cluster will be initialized, and then the database specified in the `POSTGRES_DB` environmental variable will be created. 

    We can view the initialization progress by retrieving the Docker logs for the container:

    ```shell
    docker logs test_postgres
    __OUTPUT__
    The files belonging to this database system will be owned by user "postgres".

    ... other messages describing the initialization ...

    LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
    ```

2.  Run some commands against the database from within the container:

    ```shell
    docker exec -it test_postgres psql -U postgres -d testdb -c \
     "create table Test (Id integer, Name text);"
    __OUTPUT__
    CREATE TABLE
    ```

    This uses the `psql` command to run SQL as the `postgres` superuser to create a new table in our testdb database 
    (Note: if you see a message such as "psql: error: could not connect to server: FATAL:  database "testdb" does not exist" then the database is still being initialized - check the logs as described in step #1)

    ```shell
    docker exec -it test_postgres psql -U postgres -d testdb -c \
     "insert into Test values (1, 'Bob');"
    __OUTPUT__
    INSERT 0 1
    ```

    ```shell
    docker exec -it test_postgres psql -U postgres -d testdb -c \
     "select * from Test;"
    __OUTPUT__
    id | name
    ----+------
      1 | Bob
    (1 row)   
    ```

3.  Stop and then delete the container:

    ```shell
    docker kill test_postgres
    docker rm test_postgres
    __OUTPUT__
    test_postgres
    ```

## Using a volume to persist the database

By default, any databases created will be stored in the container itself and will disappear when the container is deleted. This can be desirable for testing purposes! But otherwise, you'll want to make sure the databases are stored on a Docker *volume*, a storage area that exists outside of the container itself.

Here's an example:

1.  Start the container with a named volume for the data directory:

    ```shell
    docker run -v pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
    --name test_postgres \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
    -e POSTGRES_DB=testdb \
    -d postgres
    __OUTPUT__
    [UUID]
    ```

    The volume - named "pgdata" - will persist even after the container is removed; if a new container is created & pointed to the same volume, any data stored will be immediately available! 

2.  Store some data:

    ```shell
    docker exec -it test_postgres psql -U postgres -d testdb -c \
     "create table Test (Id integer, Name text);
     insert into Test values (1, 'Bob');"
    __OUTPUT__
    INSERT 0 1
    ```

3.  Stop and delete the container:

    ```shell
    docker kill test_postgres
    docker rm test_postgres
    __OUTPUT__
    test_postgres
    ```

4.  Create it again against the same volume:

    ```shell
    docker run -v pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data \
    --name test_postgres \
    -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=password \
    -e POSTGRES_DB=testdb \
    -d postgres
    __OUTPUT__
    [UUID]
    ```

5.  Query it, observing that the data stored in step #2 is still there:

    ```shell
    docker exec -it test_postgres psql -U postgres -d testdb -c \
     "select * from Test;"
    __OUTPUT__
    id | name
    ----+------
      1 | Bob
    (1 row)   
    ```

!!! warning
    Don't try to run multiple postgres containers simultaneously sharing the same volume for data - your database will probably be corrupted!

To remove the volume, use the command:

```shell
docker volume rm pgdata
__OUTPUT__
pgdata
```

Docker will ensure that no existing containers are referencing the volume before it'll let you remove it - you must stop and delete them first.

## Spinning up a development or testing environment, including Postgres, using Docker Compose

Docker Compose takes the basic options outlined above and allows you to configure, start & stop multiple containers together. This is very handy for standardizing a development environment, or even just keeping multiple projects separate on your workstation.

For example, you might spend some time working on a Java app, backed by a PostgreSQL database. It's built against a specific version of Java, which you don't want interfering with other projects on your machine - so, you put together a configuration like this:

```docker
version: "3.7"
services:
  javadb:
    image: "postgres"
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: password
      POSTGRES_DB: testdb
    volumes:
      - pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data
      - pgconf:/etc/postgresql
      - pglog:/var/log/postgresql

  java:
    image: openjdk:15
    volumes:
      - .:/var/tests
    environment:
      DATABASE_URL: postgres://postgres:password@javadb:5432/testdb
    working_dir: /var/tests
    init: true
    command: tail -f /dev/null

volumes:
  pgdata:
    driver: local
  pgconf:
    driver: local
  pglog:
    driver: local
```

This configures two services - containers - along with local volumes for database storage, a test database, and the connection string configured as an environmental variable in the container where you'll be doing your OpenJDK 15 Java work.

If you drop this (along with your application code) in a directory named javatestdev, you can launch both containers in the background with,

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

...and then get an interactive terminal on the Java image with,

```bash
docker exec -it javatestdev_java_1 /bin/bash
```

(the name of the container is created based on the directory and service name)
