Docker containers are an environment which exist and run independently from whatever else is running on a given machine. Containers are created from "images", which define what a given environment will look like - file system layout, running processes, etc. This makes them very convenient for side-stepping the whole "installation" problem: an image in which the necessary software has already been installed and configured can be distributed and used to create containers on any machine with Docker available.
