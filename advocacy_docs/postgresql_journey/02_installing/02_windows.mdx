Windows installers for PostgreSQL are provided by EDB at <https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads>, and greatly simplify the process of setting up a working server or installing client tooling, extensions, add-ons, and drivers for various development platforms.

Detailed installation instructions for the installer can be found here: <01_EDB_installer/02_installing_postgresql_with_the_graphical_installation_wizard/01_invoking_the_graphical_installer>

If you're installing EDB's Postgres Advanced Server, [instructions for Windows systems can be found on this site](/epas/latest/epas_inst_windows/).

## Command line tools

By default, the installer does not modify the system path. If you wish to use the command line tools (such as psql), you'll want to add PostgreSQL to the path after installation.

1.  Open the System Properties control panel and select the Advanced tab (or run SystemPropertiesAdvanced.exe)
2.  Activate the "Environment Variables..." button to open the envornment variables editor
3.  Find the `Path` variable under the "System variables" heading, and click "Edit..."
4.  Add the path that you specified as the installation directory during installation, with `\bin` appended (by default: `c:\program files\postgresql\12\bin`, where <i>12</i> is the version of PostgreSQL that you installed).

To test your installation, open a new command prompt and run,

```shell
psql -U postgres
```

You'll be prompted for the password you provided during installation. [More about psql...](http://postgresguide.com/utilities/psql.html)

## Development tools

To develop applications which connect to a PostgreSQL server, you'll need libraries for this purpose. For details, see: [Connecting to Postgres](/postgresql_journey/04_developing/connecting_to_postgres).
