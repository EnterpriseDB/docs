A PostgreSQL installation involves one or more of:

1.  The database engine itself, one or more database clusters, one or more databases, and their configuration
2.  Tools for managing the database
3.  Extensions and add-on software 

Which of these are required depends on the purpose of the installation: a full production server might involve all of them, while a development environment might not need any (although it's usually wise to have *some* tools for examining the databases being built against, for example [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/) or [psql](http://postgresguide.com/utilities/psql.html)). 

Read on for details on installing these components across various platforms.
