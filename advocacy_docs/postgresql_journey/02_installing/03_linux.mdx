## Basic installation

You can quickly install PostgreSQL on most Linux systems by configuring your system's package manager to reference the postgresql.org repositories.

Pre-built packages and instructions for most common Linux & Unix systems are available from postgresql.org: <https://www.postgresql.org/download/>

If you're installing EDB's Postgres Advanced Server, [instructions for Linux & Unix systems can be found on this site](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux/), along with [a tool to generate installation scripts for each supported platform](https://repos.enterprisedb.com/).

## Server installation details

A Linux-based PostgreSQL server installation must accomplish the following tasks:

1.  Installing the binaries, documentation, and data directory into the filesystem
2.  Creating the `postgres` superuser to own the processes and initial [cluster](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/creating-cluster.html)
3.  Configuring paths and environmental variables
4.  Initializing the default database cluster with a default database (named `postgres`) and default template (`template1`)
5.  Configure and start the `postgres` service for the default database cluster

The platform-native installation packages will accomplish all of the above, although some Linux distributions may require manual steps to intialize the default database and start the service. For additional tools, extensions and libraries (for instance, pgAdmin or PostGIS), additional packages will need to be installed - you can find many of these listed in [the PostgreSQL software catalog](https://www.postgresql.org/download/product-categories/).

### Live tutorial

This tutorial will walk through the steps for installing a PostgreSQL server on Ubuntu 18.04.4 LTS.

<KatacodaPanel />

First, we need to add the Postgresql.org repository as a source for Ubuntu's APT package manager:

```shell
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt $(lsb_release -cs)-pgdg main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/pgdg.list'
```

The command `lsb_release -cs` retrieves the name of the installed OS version, in this case "bionic" - this ensures that we're pulling from the correct repository for this release of the operating system. Supported releases can be found on [the PostgreSQL wiki](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt). The resulting [sources file](https://wiki.debian.org/SourcesList) looks like this:

```output
deb http://apt.postgresql.org/pub/repos/apt/ bionic-pgdg main
```

APT won't trust the new source until we provide it with [a trusted key](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man8/apt-secure.8.html) - we can pull that from postgresql.org and add it with the apt-key utility:

```shell
wget --quiet -O - https://www.postgresql.org/media/keys/ACCC4CF8.asc \
 | sudo apt-key add -
__OUTPUT__
OK
```

With APT configured, we can update the list of packages and install the desired version of PostgreSQL:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install postgresql
```

If you desired a version other than the latest, you'd specify that instead - for instance, `sudo apt-get install postgresql-12`.

The Ubuntu installation script runs [`initdb`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-initdb.html) to configure the default database cluster. You'll see this within the output once the cluster has been initialized:

```output
Success. You can now start the database server using:

    pg_ctlcluster 12 main start
```

Don't actually run that though; the installation script also configures and starts services to automatically, as you can see from the rest of the installation output:

```output
Ver Cluster Port Status Owner    Data directory              Log file
12  main    5432 down   postgres /var/lib/postgresql/12/main /var/log/postgresql/postgresql-12-main.log
update-alternatives: using /usr/share/postgresql/12/man/man1/postmaster.1.gz to provide /usr/share/man/man1/postmaster.1.gz (postmaster.1.gz) in auto mode
Setting up postgresql (12+216.pgdg18.04+1) ...
Processing triggers for man-db (2.8.3-2ubuntu0.1) ...
Processing triggers for ureadahead (0.100.0-21) ...
Processing triggers for libc-bin (2.27-3ubuntu1.2) ...
Processing triggers for systemd (237-3ubuntu10.41) ...
```

When the APT installation completes, you can log in as `postgres`...

```shell
su - postgres
__OUTPUT__
postgres@host01:~$
```

...and try it out!

```shell
psql -c "select count(*) from information_schema.tables;"
__OUTPUT__
 count
-------
   194
(1 row)
```

You can also observe the directory structure created as described above:

```shell
ls -R /etc/postgresql/
ls -R /var/lib/postgresql
ls -R /usr/share/postgresql
ls -R /usr/lib/postgresql
ls -R /etc/postgresql-common
```

Aren't you glad you didn't have to worry about all that? APT is a great tool. But if you want to learn more about what's involved in a Postgres installation, peruse [Installation from Source Code](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/installation.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

## Client-only installation details

A client-only installation, suitable for connecting to an existing server, need only provide client libraries and tools, e.g. psql. If you already have a database server that you intend to use, installing a client package can save a bit of time and disk space. When in doubt, install the full server package will ensure that the standard tools are available and configured.

Additional client tools can be found in [the PostgreSQL software catalog](https://www.postgresql.org/download/products/1-administrationdevelopment-tools/).

## Development installation details

To develop applications which connect to a PostgreSQL server, you'll need libraries for this purpose. For details, see: [Connecting to Postgres](/getting-started/connecting_to_postgres).
