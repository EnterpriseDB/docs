MacOS installers for PostgreSQL are provided by EDB at <https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads>, and greatly simplify the process of setting up a working server or installing client tooling, extensions, add-ons, and drivers for various development platforms.

A detailed installation walkthrough can be found here: <https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgres-tutorials/installation-postgresql-mac-os>

## Command line tools

Once installed, you can run the command line tools by referencing them in the `bin` directory under the installation path you specified during installation. For example, to run psql from the default installation directory you would type,

```shell
/Library/PostgreSQL/12/bin/psql -U postgres
```

For ease of use, you'll probably want to add this directory to your PATH, by adding a line to your `~/.bash_profile` (or `~/.zshrc` if using zsh):

```shell
export PATH="/Library/PostgreSQL/12/bin/:$PATH"
```

This step is *especially* important if you plan to use scripts or other software (such as Python's psycopg2) that rely on PostgreSQL tools. You may instead [add this directory to the system path](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106355/setting-the-system-wide-path-environment-variable-in-mavericks/106814#106814).

There are several other options for installing PostgreSQL on MacOS, with varying levels of flexibility, version support, add-ons, etc. More details can be found on [the PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/).

## Development tools

To develop applications which connect to a PostgreSQL server, you'll need libraries for this purpose. For details, see: [Connecting to Postgres](/postgresql_journey/04_developing/connecting_to_postgres).
