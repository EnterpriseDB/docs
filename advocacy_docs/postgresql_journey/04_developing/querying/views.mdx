### Introduction

PostgreSQL’s VIEW is a versatile tool for “viewing” the data in a database. A VIEW is a query that you give a name to so that you can reference it just like you would a table. There are also MATERIALIZED VIEWs, which are similar but slightly different, and we cover that here. A VIEW doesn’t replace a table—VIEWs require tables to pull information from them. However, once those tables are in place, you can use VIEWs to examine and use those tables’ data. This can be useful for a number of situations. For example, if there’s a query that you run really often, and you don’t want to keep typing it, you can use a VIEW. 

This is an interactive tutorial - you can run the examples below against a sample database right in your browser.

## Creating a view

Here, I have an example of a situation where I have two tables that I pull information from, “customer_table” and “city_table.”

```sql
select first_name, last_name, email, city 
from customer
join address on address.address_id=customer.address_id
join city on city.city_id=address.city_id
where city='London';
__OUTPUT__
 first_name | last_name |               email               |  city
------------+-----------+-----------------------------------+--------
 MATTIE     | HOFFMAN   | MATTIE.HOFFMAN@sakilacustomer.org | London
 CECIL      | VINES     | CECIL.VINES@sakilacustomer.org    | London
(2 rows)
```

If this is a query that is run often, or we want to run a query that involves information that this query already involves, we can create a VIEW with this query:

```sql
create view my_view as 
    select first_name, last_name, email, city 
    from customer
    join address on address.address_id=customer.address_id
    join city on city.city_id=address.city_id
    where city='London';
__OUTPUT__
CREATE VIEW
```

Then in the future, we can just call the VIEW itself:

```sql
select * from my_view;
__OUTPUT__
 first_name | last_name |               email               |  city
------------+-----------+-----------------------------------+--------
 MATTIE     | HOFFMAN   | MATTIE.HOFFMAN@sakilacustomer.org | London
 CECIL      | VINES     | CECIL.VINES@sakilacustomer.org    | London
(2 rows)
```

Once we’ve created a VIEW, we can look at the details of that view using the \d+ command:

```sql
\d+ my_view
__OUTPUT__
                            View "public.my_view"
   Column   | Type | Collation | Nullable | Default | Storage  | Description
------------+------+-----------+----------+---------+----------+-------------
 first_name | text |           |          |         | extended |
 last_name  | text |           |          |         | extended |
 email      | text |           |          |         | extended |
 city       | text |           |          |         | extended |
View definition:
 SELECT customer.first_name,
    customer.last_name,
    customer.email,
    city.city
   FROM customer
     JOIN address ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
     JOIN city ON city.city_id = address.city_id
  WHERE city.city = 'London'::text;
```

The view itself doesn't store data - every time it's used, the defining query is run. Observe that changing the tables used in the definition will cause the results to change:

```sql
update address set city_id=312 where city_id=544;
select * from my_view;
__OUTPUT__
UPDATE 1
 first_name | last_name |               email               |  city
------------+-----------+-----------------------------------+--------
 MATTIE     | HOFFMAN   | MATTIE.HOFFMAN@sakilacustomer.org | London
 CECIL      | VINES     | CECIL.VINES@sakilacustomer.org    | London
 VIRGINIA   | GREEN     | VIRGINIA.GREEN@sakilacustomer.org | London
(3 rows)
```

We can make VIEWs that pull information from other VIEWs as well, giving you even more flexibility over how you want to access your data.

## Creating or replacing a view

If you ever need to change an existing VIEW, the command you use depends on what you want to change. If you want to change the query that is being used, you can use a modified version of the CREATE command:

```sql
create or replace view my_view as 
select first_name, last_name, email, city, country
from customer
join address on address.address_id=customer.address_id
join city on city.city_id=address.city_id
join country on country.country_id=city.country_id
where city='London';
__OUTPUT__
CREATE VIEW
```

Examining the view shows the updated definition: 

```sql
\d+ my_view
__OUTPUT__
                            View "public.my_view"
   Column   | Type | Collation | Nullable | Default | Storage  | Description
------------+------+-----------+----------+---------+----------+-------------
 first_name | text |           |          |         | extended |
 last_name  | text |           |          |         | extended |
 email      | text |           |          |         | extended |
 city       | text |           |          |         | extended |
 country    | text |           |          |         | extended |
View definition:
 SELECT customer.first_name,
    customer.last_name,
    customer.email,
    city.city,
    country.country
   FROM customer
     JOIN address ON address.address_id = customer.address_id
     JOIN city ON city.city_id = address.city_id
     JOIN country ON country.country_id = city.country_id
  WHERE city.city = 'London'::text;
```

## Altering a view

On the other hand, if you want to change the properties of the VIEW, such as the owner, or rename the VIEW, you can use the ALTER VIEW command.

```sql
alter view my_view rename to customers_london;
__OUTPUT__
ALTER VIEW
```

One way to manage your VIEWs is to use “pg_views.” This will allow you to see all of the VIEWs that currently exist, who created them, the name of the VIEW, the schema they are in, and the definition.

```sql
select * from pg_views where viewname='customers_london'; 
__OUTPUT__
 schemaname |     viewname     | viewowner |                             definition
------------+------------------+-----------+--------------------------------------------------------------------
 public     | customers_london | postgres  |  SELECT customer.first_name,                                      +
            |                  |           |     customer.last_name,                                           +
            |                  |           |     customer.email,                                               +
            |                  |           |     city.city,                                                    +
            |                  |           |     country.country                                               +
            |                  |           |    FROM (((customer                                               +
            |                  |           |      JOIN address ON ((address.address_id = customer.address_id)))+
            |                  |           |      JOIN city ON ((city.city_id = address.city_id)))             +
            |                  |           |      JOIN country ON ((country.country_id = city.country_id)))    +
            |                  |           |   WHERE (city.city = 'London'::text);
(1 row)
```

## Dropping a view

Finally, if you decide you no longer need a VIEW, simply use the DROP VIEW command to remove it.

```sql
drop view customers_london;
__OUTPUT__
DROP VIEW
```

## Materializing a view

[A "materialized" view](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rules-materializedviews.html) is one where the results are stored - in effect, it's a table that remembers the query used to create it. Unlike the example above, a materialized view does *not* automatically reflect changes made to the tables in its definition.

Let's create the view used above again, but as a materialized view:

```sql
create materialized view customers_london as 
select first_name, last_name, email, city, country
from customer
join address on address.address_id=customer.address_id
join city on city.city_id=address.city_id
join country on country.country_id=city.country_id
where city='London';
__OUTPUT__
SELECT 3
```

Query the new view:

```sql
select * from customers_london;
__OUTPUT__
 first_name | last_name |               email               |  city  |    country
------------+-----------+-----------------------------------+--------+----------------
 VIRGINIA   | GREEN     | VIRGINIA.GREEN@sakilacustomer.org | London | United Kingdom
 CECIL      | VINES     | CECIL.VINES@sakilacustomer.org    | London | United Kingdom
 MATTIE     | HOFFMAN   | MATTIE.HOFFMAN@sakilacustomer.org | London | United Kingdom
(3 rows)
```

And now modify the underlying data and re-query:

```sql
update address set city_id=312 where city_id=545;
select * from customers_london;
__OUTPUT__
UPDATE 1
 first_name | last_name |               email               |  city  |    country
------------+-----------+-----------------------------------+--------+----------------
 VIRGINIA   | GREEN     | VIRGINIA.GREEN@sakilacustomer.org | London | United Kingdom
 CECIL      | VINES     | CECIL.VINES@sakilacustomer.org    | London | United Kingdom
 MATTIE     | HOFFMAN   | MATTIE.HOFFMAN@sakilacustomer.org | London | United Kingdom
(3 rows)
```

Observe that the results *haven't* changed, even though the data has - the materialized view maintains its own copy of the results. To refresh those results, we must use `refresh materialized view`:

```sql
refresh materialized view customers_london;
__OUTPUT__
REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW
```

Querying the view again will now return current results:

```sql
select * from customers_london;
__OUTPUT__
 first_name | last_name |               email               |  city  |    country
------------+-----------+-----------------------------------+--------+----------------
 EDWARD     | BAUGH     | EDWARD.BAUGH@sakilacustomer.org   | London | United Kingdom
 VIRGINIA   | GREEN     | VIRGINIA.GREEN@sakilacustomer.org | London | United Kingdom
 CECIL      | VINES     | CECIL.VINES@sakilacustomer.org    | London | United Kingdom
 MATTIE     | HOFFMAN   | MATTIE.HOFFMAN@sakilacustomer.org | London | United Kingdom
(4 rows)
```

Materialized views are useful in situations where results are expensive to obtain, and *don't* always need to be current - you can refresh them on a schedule or as-needed without imposing the cost of the defining query on every query that uses them.
