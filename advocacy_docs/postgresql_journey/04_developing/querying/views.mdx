### Introduction

PostgreSQL’s VIEW is a versatile tool for “viewing” the data in a database. A VIEW is a query that you give a name to so that you can reference it just like you would a table. There are also MATERIALIZED VIEWs, which are similar but slightly different, and we cover that here. A VIEW doesn’t replace a table—VIEWs require tables to pull information from them. However, once those tables are in place, you can use VIEWs to examine and use those tables’ data. This can be useful for a number of situations. For example, if there’s a query that you run really often, and you don’t want to keep typing it, you can use a VIEW.

Materialized views are useful in situations where results are expensive to obtain, and *don't* always need to be current - you can refresh them on a schedule or as-needed without imposing the cost of the defining query on every query that uses them.
