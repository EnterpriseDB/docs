From the perspective of a PostgreSQL server, a connection is an active channel through which [messages are exchanged](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/protocol.html) between a server process and a client. 

...but this is rarely what you will work with directly. Most platforms offer libraries and tools to abstract away the low-level details of a connection and allow you to think about the problem you're using PostgreSQL to solve.

This category covers the basics of setting up a connection and querying a PostgreSQL server from the perspective of various popular platforms.
