There are multiple ways of connecting to PostgreSQL from Python, and most of them will require installing [a PEP 249-compliant](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0249/) adapter library. There is [a list of such adapters on the PostgreSQL wiki](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Python); we strongly recommend [Psycopg2](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Psycopg2), as it is widely compatible and fast. You can install psycopg2 using pip:

    pip install psycopg2

If you encounter errors, it's likely that pg_config is not installed or cannot be found; fixing this will usually involve either installing the necessary PostgreSQL libraries or reconfiguring your search path; solutions for various operating systems can be found [on Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11618898/pg-config-executable-not-found).
