Some guy DROPs table on a Friday afternoon, and you need that data back online as fast as possible. It's onsite and it streams, near real-time. Only a couple versions and you can roll back 15 mins and get back up and running.

## Onsite backups

Onsite backup can be suitable for human error recovery because you have to have a known good backup at the time the error is detected.
