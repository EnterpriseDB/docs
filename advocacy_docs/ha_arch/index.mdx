<div id="ha_architecture_overview" class="registered_link"></div>

EDB currently maintains a list of six standard High Availability architecture designs with varying base attributes and design goals. Information for these will be maintained here for reference purposes.

## Diagram Conventions

Due to the relative complexity of these diagrams, each Postgres node is actually a representative collection of multiple services.

Diagrams making use of physical streaming replication (PSR) should be interpreted as the following:

Diagrams based on EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) remove the failover management component for the following structure:

Interaction between these integral services is not represented on the diagrams, but should be assumed to be present.

<div id="one_by_three_summary" class="registered_link"></div>

## [One by Three](01_one-by-three)

![](images/1x3.png)

* Least expensive option available
* Only survives a single node failure
* No coverage for AZ failure
* No coverage for Region failure
* Offsite backup only implied---not enforced by design

---

<div id="one_by_three_plus_one_summary" class="registered_link"></div>

## [One by Three Plus One](02_one-by-three-plus-one)

![](images/1x3+1.png)

* Added AZ for:
  - Zone or Region failure
  - Dedicated off-site backup
* Still relatively inexpensive
* Historically referred to as “Quick Deploy”

---

<div id="two_by_three_summary" class="registered_link"></div>

## [Two by Three](03_two-by-three)

![](images/2x3.png)

* Meant for full stack redundancy in two AZs
* Low RTO only within a Zone
* Inter-Zone failover is manual only
* Minor cost increase due to node count
* May substitute Postgres node for Witness for better read scalability

---

<div id="two_by_three_plus_one_summary" class="registered_link"></div>

## [Two by Three Plus One](04_two-by-three-plus-one)

![](images/2x3+1.png)

* Meant for full stack redundancy in two AZs
* Third AZ added to enable automated failover between Zones
* Low RTO within a Zone
* Medium RTO between Zones
* Moderate cost increase due to node count

---

<div id="three_by_one_summary" class="registered_link"></div>

## [Three by One](05_three-by-one)

![](images/3x1.png)

* Meant for Zone or Region data distribution
* Lower node cost, but higher Zone / Region costs
* Medium RTO in all cases due to node distribution
* Very resilient in terms of Zone or Region failure
* Good match for latency-agnostic stacks

---

<div id="one_by_three_summary" class="registered_link"></div>

## [Three by Three](06_three-by-three)

![](images/3x3.png)

* Meant for high distribution and scalability demands
* Low RTO within a Zone
* Medium RTO between Zones
* Most expensive option
* May be extended to further AZs
* Most resilient in terms of Zone or Region failure
