The **Two by Three Plus One** architecture consists of **six Postgres nodes** arranged in a **Physical Streaming Replication** relationship across **two Availability Zones** to achieve **High Availability**. A third Availability Zone introduces an independent **Witness node** to facilitate **Automated Failover** between Zones. Both of the populated Availability Zones also include a **Barman** backup service for full **Offsite Backup** purposes.

Each Availability Zone allows applications and user sessions to operate in full capacity in the event of an outage of either Zone. Depending on latency requirements, this second Zone may exist within the same Region, or a remote Region for improved resilience. This design reflects a **medium RPO** since both Zones can survive node outages, and a **medium RTO** since both zones are automated.

This is an ideal architecture for high throughput production environments which require failover automation within and between each operational Zone.

## Variants

### Postgres Distributed Variant

When using EDB Postgres Distributed, the Two by Three Plus One architecture adds an additional **Proxy** resource. Accessing Postgres through the Proxy component substantially **improves RTO**, at a slightly increased cost due to licensing. All nodes in this variant are always writable, and the Proxy determines which should be the principal write target in order to reduce the risk of write conflicts.

Each Availability Zone has its own Proxy and local Write Group so that each Zone may process write traffic simultaneously. This variant best fits applications with Location or Region-specific data, leading to naturally lower risk of write conflicts between each Zone.

### Synchronous Replication Variant

It is possible to moderately **improve RPO** for the Two by Three Plus One design by using **Synchronous Replication**. While this also slightly increases write latency, it also mitigates the loss of committed transactions. This design also exceeds the minimum of two Synchronous Replicas, allowing one Replica to be offline at a time without interrupting write traffic on the Primary. Because the additional Synchronous Replicas are in another Availability Zone, overall RPO is further enhanced.

### PgPool Variant

PgPool is commonly used to distribute read and write traffic to different targets. This variant of the Two by Three Plus One design incorporates a PgPool node in each Availability Zone for slightly **improved Scalability**. Witness nodes may also be replaced with a Postgres Replica and added to the Read Pool to further increase read scalability. If applications are not particularly sensitive to latency, itâ€™s also possible to incorporate the remote Availability Zones into the Read Pool as well.
