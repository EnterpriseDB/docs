Cloud Native PostgreSQL is available for a free evaluation.
The process is different between Vanilla/Community PostgreSQL
and EDB Postgres Advanced.

Please refer to the ["License and License keys" section](license_keys.md)
for terms and more details.

## Evaluating PostgreSQL

By default, Cloud Native PostgreSQL installs the latest available
version of Community PostgreSQL. The operator will automatically
generate an implicit trial license for the cluster that lasts for
30 days.

This license is ideal for evaluation, proof of concept, integration with CI/CD pipelines, and so on.

PostgreSQL container images are available at
[quay.io/enterprisedb/postgresql](https://quay.io/repository/enterprisedb/postgresql).

## Evaluating EDB Postgres Advanced

You can use Cloud Native PostgreSQL with EDB Postgres Advanced
too. You need to request a trial license key from the
[EnterpriseDB website](https://cloud-native.enterprisedb.com).

EDB Postgres Advanced container images are available at
[quay.io/enterprisedb/edb-postgres-advanced](https://quay.io/repository/enterprisedb/edb-postgres-advanced).

Once you have received the license key, you can use EDB Postgres Advanced
by setting in the `spec` section of the `Cluster` deployment configuration file:

- `imageName` to point to the `quay.io/enterprisedb/edb-postgres-advanced` repository
- `licenseKey` to your license key (in the form of a string)

Please refer to the full example in the [configuration samples](samples.md) section.
