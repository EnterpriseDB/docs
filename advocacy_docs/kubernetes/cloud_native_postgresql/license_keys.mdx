A license key is always required for the operator to work.

The only exception is when you run the operator with Community PostgreSQL:
in this case, if the license key is unset, a cluster will be started with the default
trial license - which automatically expires after 30 days.

!!! Important
    After the license expiration, the operator will cease any reconciliation attempt
    on the cluster, effectively stopping to manage its status.
    The pods and the data will still be available.

## Company level license keys

A license key allows you to create an unlimited number of PostgreSQL
clusters in your installation.

The license key needs to be available in a `ConfigMap` in the same
namespace where the operator is deployed.

!!! Seealso "Operator configuration"
For more information, please refer to the ["Operator configuration"](operator_conf.md) section.

Once the company level license is installed, the validity of the
license key can be checked inside the cluster status.

```sh
kubectl get cluster cluster_example -o yaml
[...]
status:
  [...]
  licenseStatus:
    licenseExpiration: "2021-11-06T09:36:02Z"
    licenseStatus: Trial
    valid: true
    isImplicit: false
    isTrial: true
[...]
```

### Kubernetes installations via YAML manifest

When the operator is installed in Kubernetes using the YAML manifest,
it is deployed by default in the `postgresql-operator-system` namespace.

Given the namespace name, and the license key, you can create
the config map with the following command:

```
kubectl create configmap -n [NAMESPACE_NAME_HERE] \
    postgresql-operator-controller-manager-config \
    --from-literal=EDB_LICENSE_KEY=[LICENSE_KEY_HERE]
```

Operator pods will need to be recreated to apply the new configuration. You
can use the following command:

```sh
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n [NAMESPACE_NAME_HERE] \
    postgresql-operator-controller-manager
```

### OpenShift and Kubernetes installations with OLM

When instead OLM is used (i.e. on OpenShift or on Kubernetes from OperatorHub),
you can choose to install the operator in a single namespace
or to make it available in all namespaces. The second option is
the default one, and the operator will be installed in
`openshift-operators` on OpenShift and `operators` on OperatorHub.

Given the namespace name, and the license key, you can create
the config map with the following command:

```
kubectl create configmap -n [NAMESPACE_NAME_HERE] \
    postgresql-operator-controller-manager-config \
    --from-literal=EDB_LICENSE_KEY=[LICENSE_KEY_HERE]
```

You'll need to delete the current operator pods. New pods will be
automatically recreated and will use the configmap:

```sh
kubectl delete pods -n [NAMESPACE_NAME_HERE] \
  -l app.kubernetes.io/name=cloud-native-postgresql
```

## Cluster level license keys

Each `Cluster` resource has a `licenseKey` parameter in its definition.
You can find the expiration date, as well as more information about the license,
in the cluster status:

```sh
kubectl get cluster cluster_example -o yaml
[...]
status:
  [...]
  licenseStatus:
    licenseExpiration: "2021-11-06T09:36:02Z"
    licenseStatus: Trial
    valid: true
    isImplicit: false
    isTrial: true
[...]
```

A cluster license key can be updated with a new one at any moment, to extend
the expiration date or move the cluster to a production license.
