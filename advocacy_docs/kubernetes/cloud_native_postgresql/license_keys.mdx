A license key is always required for the operator to work.

The only exception is when you run the operator with Community PostgreSQL:
in this case, if the license key is unset, a cluster will be started with the default
trial license - which automatically expires after 30 days.

## Company level license keys

A license key allows you to create an unlimited number of PostgreSQL
clusters in your installation.

The license key needs to be available in a `Secret` in the same namespace where
the operator is deployed (`ConfigMap` is also available, but not recommended
for a license key).

!!! Seealso "Operator configuration"
    For more information, please refer to the ["Operator configuration"](operator_conf.md) section.

Once the company level license is installed, the validity of the
license key can be checked inside the cluster status.

```sh
kubectl get cluster cluster_example -o yaml
[...]
status:
  [...]
  licenseStatus:
    licenseExpiration: "2021-11-06T09:36:02Z"
    licenseStatus: Trial
    valid: true
    isImplicit: false
    isTrial: true
[...]
```

### Kubernetes installations via YAML manifest

When the operator is installed in Kubernetes using the YAML manifest,
it is deployed by default in the `postgresql-operator-system` namespace.

Given the namespace name, and the license key, you can create
the config map with the following command:

```
kubectl create configmap -n [NAMESPACE_NAME_HERE] \
    postgresql-operator-controller-manager-config \
    --from-literal=EDB_LICENSE_KEY=[LICENSE_KEY_HERE]
```

Operator pods will need to be recreated to apply the new configuration. You
can use the following command:

```sh
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n [NAMESPACE_NAME_HERE] \
    postgresql-operator-controller-manager
```

### OpenShift and Kubernetes installations with OLM

When instead OLM is used (i.e. on OpenShift or on Kubernetes from OperatorHub),
you can choose to install the operator in a single namespace
or to make it available in all namespaces. The second option is
the default one, and the operator will be installed in
`openshift-operators` on OpenShift and `operators` on OperatorHub.

You can add a given license key to an entire cluster, by creating a secret in
the desired namespace (`openshift-operators`, `operators`, or the selected one)
with the following command:

```
kubectl create secret generic -n [NAMESPACE_NAME_HERE] \
    postgresql-operator-controller-manager-config \
    --from-literal=EDB_LICENSE_KEY=[LICENSE_KEY_HERE]
```

You'll need to delete the current operator pods. New pods will be
automatically recreated and will use the secret:

```sh
kubectl delete pods -n [NAMESPACE_NAME_HERE] \
  -l app.kubernetes.io/name=cloud-native-postgresql
```

## Cluster level license keys

Each `Cluster` resource has a `licenseKey` parameter in its definition.
You can find the expiration date, as well as more information about the license,
in the cluster status:

```sh
kubectl get cluster cluster_example -o yaml
[...]
status:
  [...]
  licenseStatus:
    licenseExpiration: "2021-11-06T09:36:02Z"
    licenseStatus: Trial
    valid: true
    isImplicit: false
    isTrial: true
[...]
```

A cluster license key can be updated with a new one at any moment, to extend
the expiration date or move the cluster to a production license.

## License key secret at cluster level

Each `Cluster` resource can also have a `licenseKeySecret` parameter, which contains
the name and key of a secret. That secret contains the license key provided by EnterpriseDB.

This field will take precedence over `licenseKey`: it will be refreshed
when you change the secret, in order to extend the expiration date, or switching from a trial
license to a production license.

## What happens when a license expires

After the license expiration, the operator will cease any reconciliation
attempt on the cluster, effectively stopping to manage its status. This also
includes any self-healing and high availability capabilities, such as automated
failover and switchovers.

The pods and the data will still be available.
