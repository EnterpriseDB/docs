### Available platforms

pgBackRest packages are available on the following platforms.

#### Debian/Ubuntu

To install pgBackRest, configure the [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/) **apt** repository and then run:

```bash
$ sudo apt-get install pgbackrest
```

The following additional packages will be installed:

* `postgresql-client-common`
* `postgresql-common`

#### RHEL/CentOS

pgBackRest can be installed from the [PostgreSQL](https://yum.postgresql.org/) **yum** repository, and requires Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux ([EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL)).

Once you configured the repositories, run the following command to install pgBackRest:

```bash
$ sudo yum install pgbackrest
```

The following additional packages will be installed:

* `postgresql-libs`
* `libzstd`

### EDB Postgres Advanced Server

The PGDG packages will fetch **PostgreSQL** libraries and create the `postgres` system user.

If **EDB Postgres Advanced Server** is already installed on the system, the libraries installed at that time would be used.

By default, the packages create the following directories owned by `postgres`:
* `/var/lib/pgbackrest`
* `/var/log/pgbackrest`
* `/var/spool/pgbackrest`

The `pg_hba.conf` settings should allow the `postgres` user to execute the `pgbackrest` command.

If you are using **EDB Postgres Advanced Server**, the `enterprisedb` system user will execute the `pgbackrest` command. The following commands will change the ownership of the pgBackRest directories:

```bash
$ sudo chown -R enterprisedb: /var/lib/pgbackrest
$ sudo chown -R enterprisedb: /var/log/pgbackrest
$ sudo chown -R enterprisedb: /var/spool/pgbackrest
```
