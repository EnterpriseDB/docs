This section walks you through basic pgBackRest configuration process and how to take a first backup of the database cluster running locally. It also gives a brief introduction of the `backup`, `restore`, and `info` commands.

The [installation](02-installation) procedure must be followed before proceeding to this section.

### Configuration

The default pgBackRest configuration file location is `/etc/pgbackrest/pgbackrest.conf`. If it does not exist, then `/etc/pgbackrest.conf` is used next.

For more information about configuration parameters, see the [appendix section](98-appendix/#configuration-reference).

The following example configures a `demo` stanza to take a backup of a database cluster running on the local host.

For **EDB Postgres Advanced Server**:

```ini
[global]
repo1-path=/var/lib/edb/as13/backups

[demo]
pg1-path=/var/lib/edb/as13/data
pg1-user=enterprisedb
pg1-port=5444
```

For **PostgreSQL**:

```ini
[global]
repo1-path=/var/lib/pgsql/13/backups

[demo]
pg1-path=/var/lib/pgsql/13/data
pg1-user=postgres
pg1-port=5432
```

Once pgBackRest is configured, set up the database archiver process:

```ini
# postgresql.conf
archive_mode = on
archive_command = 'pgbackrest --stanza=demo archive-push %p'
```

As changing the `archive_mode` parameter requires a service restart, and changing the `archive_command` only requires a configuration reload, we recommend enabling `archive_mode` with an empty `archive_command` (or pointing to /bin/true) when initiating a new database cluster.

Assume the identity of a system user (`postgres` or `enterprisedb`) and initiate the pgBackRest repository:

```bash
$ pgbackrest --stanza=demo --log-level-console=info stanza-create
```

Check the configuration and the archiving process:

```bash
$ pgbackrest --stanza=demo --log-level-console=info check
```

### Backups

When invoking pgBackRest, you can specify any one of the backup type:

* Full backup - `full`
  * Copies all database cluster files.
  * No dependencies on previous backups.

For example:

```bash
$ pgbackrest --stanza=demo --type=full backup
```

* Incremental backup - `incr`
  * Copies only the database cluster files that have changed since the last backup.
  * Depends on other backups to restore the incremental backup.

For example:

```bash
$ pgbackrest --stanza=demo --type=incr backup
```

* Differential backup - `diff`
  * Copies only the database cluster files that have changed since the last full backup.
  * Similar to an incremental backup, but always depends on the last full backup.

For example:

```bash
$ pgbackrest --stanza=demo --type=diff backup
```

If there is no full backup to base an incremental or differential backup on, pgBackRest will run in full backup mode instead.

### Backup Information

Use the `info` command to get information about backups.

```bash
$ pgbackrest --stanza=demo info
stanza: demo
    status: ok
    cipher: none

    db (current)
        wal archive min/max (13-1): 000000010000000000000001/000000010000000000000007

        full backup: 20201019-162148F
            timestamp start/stop: 2020-10-19 16:21:48 / 2020-10-19 16:21:58
            wal start/stop: 000000010000000000000003 / 000000010000000000000003
            database size: 23.9MB, backup size: 23.9MB
            repository size: 2.9MB, repository backup size: 2.9MB
...
```

By default, the `info` command provides a human-readable summary of backups for the stanza requested. Without specifying `--stanza`, the `info` command will operate on all stanzas.

### Restore

Use the `restore` command to restore a backup. The `--delta` option allows to keep the existing database cluster files and only recover as required, where as without the `--delta` option all files will be restored. Before running the restore command, stop the database cluster and (unless the `--delta` option is used) remove all files from the data directory, and from tablespaces.

```bash
$ pgbackrest --stanza=demo restore
```

Currently, the only way to verify the consistency of a backup is to restore it. We then recommend to try restore backups on a regular basis.

#### Recovery target

By default, the `restore` command will restore the latest backup and apply all of the archived WAL files found in the repository.

To choose the recovery target type for the restore, include the `--type` command-line option with one of the following keywords:

* `default` - recover to the end of the archive stream.
* `immediate` - recovery only until the database becomes consistent.
* `lsn` - recover to the LSN (Log Sequence Number).
* `name` - recover to the restore point.
* `xid` - recover to the transaction ID.
* `time` - recover to a specific timestamp.
* `preserve` - preserve the existing recovery settings.
* `standby` - add `standby_mode=on` or `standby.signal`.
* `none` - no recovery settings provided.

When `--type` is set to **lsn**, **name**, transaction ID (**xid**), or **time**, use the `--target` option to specify a restore point.

pgBackRest will automatically select the correct backup set to restore if a recovery target time is specified. Otherwise, the latest backup set will be used. To restore a specific backup set, use the `--set` option.

To change the `recovery_target_action` PostgreSQL setting, use the restore `--target-action` option:

* `pause` - pause when recovery target is reached (default).
* `promote` - promote and switch timeline when recovery target is reached.
* `shutdown` - shutdown server when recovery target is reached.
