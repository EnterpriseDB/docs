---

This section walks you through the recommended settings while using pgBackRest.

### Encryption

Use the following settings to encrypt the files in the repository `repo1`:

```ini
repo1-cipher-pass=FIXME
repo1-cipher-type=aes-256-cbc
```

The `cipher-pass` should be **base64** encoded. For example, to generate a random passphrase use the following setting:

```bash
$ openssl rand -base64 48
```

### Maximum Number of Processes

Use the following setting to set the maximum number of processes for compression usage and file transfer:

```ini
process-max=FIXME
```

Each process will perform compression and transfer to make the command run faster, but do not set `process-max` so high that it impacts server load and performance.

### Backup Fast Start

Use the `start-fast=y` setting to force a checkpoint to start the backup quickly. This is achieved inside pgBackRest by passing **true** to the fast parameter of the **pg_start_backup()** database function. The backup will then begin immediately rather than waiting for the next regular checkpoint triggered by the database server itself.

### Delta

Use the `delta=y` setting to restore or backup using checksums.

During a restore, the data and tablespaces directories are expected to be present, but empty. This option performs a delta restore using checksums.

During a backup, this option will use checksums instead of timestamps to determine if files will be copied.

### Log Levels

The output of each command will be printed in the console and a log file.

Use the following `log-level-console` and `log-level-file` settings to apply the log level:

- **off**;
- **error**;
- **warn**;
- **info**;
- **detail**;
- **debug**;
- **trace**.

**CAUTION:** Trace-level logging may expose secrets such as keys and passwords.

To add more output in the log file in case the executed command encounters an error and to avoid re-executing the command for more information, use the following settings:

```ini
log-level-console=info
log-level-file=debug
```

### EDB Postgres Advanced Server 15 compatibility

PostgreSQL forks may update the pg_control version or WAL headers without affecting the structures that pgBackRest depends on. The [pg-version-force](https://github.com/pgbackrest/pgbackrest/commit/740c2258e36613b1b4e76bab452d0e610a399e7f) option has been added in [v2.45](https://github.com/pgbackrest/pgbackrest/releases/tag/release/2.45) to force pgBackRest to treat a cluster as the specified version when it cannot be automatically identified.

When using **EDB Postgres Advanced Server** 15 or above, you might see this kind of error:

```
WARN: unable to check pg1: [VersionNotSupportedError] unexpected control version = 1501 and catalog version = 202209061
      HINT: is this version of PostgreSQL supported?
```

To solve this problem, add `pg-version-force=15` into your configuration, in the stanza section (where `15` is the major release version used).
