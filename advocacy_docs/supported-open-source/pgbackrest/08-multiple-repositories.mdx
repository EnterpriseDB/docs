title: 'Multiple Repositories'
description: "Multiple Repositories Support Feature"
---

A key feature of the [v2.33](https://github.com/pgbackrest/pgbackrest/releases/tag/release%2F2.33) pgBackrest release is support for multiple repositories. This lets you define different behavior for different backup repositories. As an example, you could have a local repository for fast restore that had short retention period (to save space) paired with a remote repository which is larger for cold storage.

This feature introduces a new [`--repo`](https://pgbackrest.org/configuration.html#section-repository/option-repo) option which can be used to set the repository the command should apply to. All `repo*-` options are indexed to enable configuring multiple repositories.


In this section, we will set up a **demo** cluster (using **EDB Postgres Advanced Server** version 13 on CentOS 7) to demonstrate how this new feature impacts each pgBackRest command.


### Configuration

> It must be noted that in this demo, we will set up two local repositories on our database host. For production purposes, it is **recommended** to store each repository on separate storage, and configure at least one remote repository.


```ini
[global]
# repository details
repo1-path=/var/lib/edb/as13/backups/repo1
repo1-retention-full=1
repo2-path=/var/lib/edb/as13/backups/repo2
repo2-retention-full=1

# general options
process-max=2
log-level-console=info
log-level-file=debug
start-fast=y
delta=y

[demo]
pg1-path=/var/lib/edb/as13/data
pg1-user=enterprisedb
pg1-port=5444
```

For safety reasons, the `--repo` option can't be defined in the configuration file or a warning will be triggered: `WARN: configuration file contains command-line only option 'repo'`. If there is more than one repository configured and the `--repo` option is not specified for a command, the repository with the highest priority order (e.g. `repo1` then `repo2`) will be chosen by default.

The `--repo` option is not required when only `repo1` is configured to maintain backward compatibility. However, when a single repository is configured, it is recommended to use `repo1` in the configuration.


### Initialization

#### Stanza Create Command

The `stanza-create` command will automatically operate on all configured repositories:

```bash
$ pgbackrest --stanza=demo stanza-create
P00   INFO: stanza-create for stanza 'demo' on repo1
P00   INFO: stanza-create for stanza 'demo' on repo2
```

#### Check Command

The `check` command will trigger a new WAL segment to be archived and try to push it to all defined repositories:

```bash
$ pgbackrest --stanza=demo check
P00   INFO: check repo1 configuration (primary)
P00   INFO: check repo2 configuration (primary)
P00   INFO: check repo1 archive for WAL (primary)
P00   INFO: WAL segment ... successfully archived to '...' on repo1
P00   INFO: check repo2 archive for WAL (primary)
P00   INFO: WAL segment ... successfully archived to '...' on repo2
```

#### Archive Push Command

The `archive-push` command will always archive WALs in all configured repositories. Backups will need to be scheduled individually for each repository. In most cases, this is desirable since backup types and retention could vary per repository.

The `archive_command` can still be defined as usual:

```bash
$ psql -d postgres -c "show archive_command;"
             archive_command              
------------------------------------------
 pgbackrest --stanza=demo archive-push %p
(1 row)
```

Here is a `DEBUG` extract of the PostgreSQL logs showing the `archive-push` activity:

```
...
P00  DEBUG:     storage/storage::storageNewWrite: => {
	type: posix, name: {"/var/lib/edb/as13/backups/repo1/archive/demo/13-1/0000000100000000/
							000000010000000000000005-be9a61a800934879842fa647b0d50385f44e0228.gz"}, 
	modeFile: 0640, modePath: 0750, createPath: true, syncFile: true, syncPath: true, atomic: true}
...
P00  DEBUG:     storage/storage::storageNewWrite: => {
	type: posix, name: {"/var/lib/edb/as13/backups/repo2/archive/demo/13-1/0000000100000000/
							000000010000000000000005-be9a61a800934879842fa647b0d50385f44e0228.gz"}, 
	modeFile: 0640, modePath: 0750, createPath: true, syncFile: true, syncPath: true, atomic: true}
...
P00   INFO: pushed WAL file '000000010000000000000005' to the archive
```

The `archive-push` command will try to push the WAL archive to all reachable repositories. The idea is to archive to as many repositories as possible even if we still need to throw an error to PostgreSQL to prevent it from removing the WAL file.

```
P00   INFO: archive-push command begin: [pg_wal/000000010000000000000006] ...
...
P00   INFO: archive-push command begin: [pg_wal/000000010000000000000007] ...
ERROR: [104]: archive-push command encountered error(s):
       repo2: [PathOpenError] unable to list file info for path '...': [13] Permission denied
P00   INFO: archive-push command end: aborted with exception [104]
DETAIL:  The failed archive command was: pgbackrest --stanza=demo archive-push pg_wal/000000010000000000000007
WARNING:  archiving write-ahead log file "000000010000000000000007" failed too many times, will try again later
```

The PostgreSQL `archiver` process should then report an error:

```bash
$ ps -o pid,cmd fx |grep archiver
 4440  \_ postgres: archiver failed on 000000010000000000000007
```

The next WAL segments should not then be archived:

```bash
$ psql -d postgres -c "SELECT pg_create_restore_point('generate some activity'); SELECT pg_switch_wal();"
 pg_switch_wal 
---------------
 0/80001C8
(1 row)

$ ls as13/data/pg_wal/archive_status/ |grep ".ready"
000000010000000000000007.ready
000000010000000000000008.ready
```

This becomes very handy by adding `archive-async=y` to the configuration in order to use asynchronous archiving processes within pgBackRest itself. Even if PostgreSQL `archiver` process is still stuck, the archives will reach the working repositories:

```bash
$ $ ls /var/lib/edb/as13/backups/repo1/archive/demo/13-1/0000000100000000/
000000010000000000000005-be9a61a800934879842fa647b0d50385f44e0228.gz
000000010000000000000006-7108296955e1208c93447dcfc5712ce59af97907.gz
000000010000000000000007-f1b6fcdd23e96a19a7a89dc92613674c2316aa49.gz
000000010000000000000008-791c44d39ef772d58e51d64c8e3589231d3916a4.gz
000000010000000000000009-47241214eb3fd5e693eed778caa7b304a778ecc2.gz

$ ls /var/lib/edb/as13/backups/repo2/archive/demo/13-1/0000000100000000/
000000010000000000000005-be9a61a800934879842fa647b0d50385f44e0228.gz

```

Let us unblock the `archiver` process (and remove asynchronous archiving) before going further:

```bash
$ $ ps -o pid,cmd fx |grep archiver
 4440  \_ postgres: archiver last was 00000001000000000000000
```


### Backups

#### Backup Command

Let us take a few backups:

```bash

```

Here, we alternated `full` and `incr` backups in each repository.


#### Info Command

```bash
$ pgbackrest info --stanza=demo
stanza: demo
    status: ok
    cipher: none

    db (current)
        wal archive min/max (13): 000000010000000000000002/000000010000000000000012

        full backup: 20210419-142212F
            timestamp start/stop: 2021-04-19 14:22:12 / 2021-04-19 14:22:26
            wal start/stop: 00000001000000000000000C / 00000001000000000000000C
            database size: 50.4MB, database backup size: 50.4MB

            timestamp start/stop: 2021-04-19 14:24:14 / 2021-04-19 14:24:26
            wal start/stop: 00000001000000000000000E / 00000001000000000000000E
            database size: 50.5MB, database backup size: 50.5MB
            repo2: backup set size: 8MB, backup size: 8MB

        incr backup: 20210419-142212F_20210419-142502I
            timestamp start/stop: 2021-04-19 14:25:02 / 2021-04-19 14:25:04
            wal start/stop: 000000010000000000000010 / 000000010000000000000010
            database size: 50.5MB, database backup size: 613.4KB
            repo1: backup set size: 8MB, backup size: 26.3KB
            backup reference list: 20210419-142212F

        incr backup: 20210419-142414F_20210419-142556I
            timestamp start/stop: 2021-04-19 14:25:56 / 2021-04-19 14:25:57
            wal start/stop: 000000010000000000000012 / 000000010000000000000012
            database size: 50.6MB, database backup size: 661.5KB
            repo2: backup set size: 8MB, backup size: 28KB
            backup reference list: 20210419-142414F

```

The default order will sort backups by dates mixing the repositories. It might be confusing to find the backups depending on each other.

We can then split this view per repository:

```bash
$ pgbackrest info --stanza=demo --repo=1
stanza: demo
    status: ok
    cipher: none

    db (current)
        wal archive min/max (13): 00000001000000000000000C/000000010000000000000012

        full backup: 20210419-142212F
            timestamp start/stop: 2021-04-19 14:22:12 / 2021-04-19 14:22:26
            wal start/stop: 00000001000000000000000C / 00000001000000000000000C
            database size: 50.4MB, database backup size: 50.4MB
            repo1: backup set size: 8MB, backup size: 8MB

        incr backup: 20210419-142212F_20210419-142502I
            timestamp start/stop: 2021-04-19 14:25:02 / 2021-04-19 14:25:04
            wal start/stop: 000000010000000000000010 / 000000010000000000000010
            database size: 50.5MB, database backup size: 613.4KB
            repo1: backup set size: 8MB, backup size: 26.3KB
            backup reference list: 20210419-142212F

$ pgbackrest info --stanza=demo --repo=2
stanza: demo
    status: ok
    cipher: none

    db (current)
        wal archive min/max (13): 00000001000000000000000E/000000010000000000000012

        full backup: 20210419-142414F
            timestamp start/stop: 2021-04-19 14:24:14 / 2021-04-19 14:24:26
            wal start/stop: 00000001000000000000000E / 00000001000000000000000E
            database size: 50.5MB, database backup size: 50.5MB
            repo2: backup set size: 8MB, backup size: 8MB

        incr backup: 20210419-142414F_20210419-142556I
            timestamp start/stop: 2021-04-19 14:25:56 / 2021-04-19 14:25:57
            wal start/stop: 000000010000000000000012 / 000000010000000000000012
            database size: 50.6MB, database backup size: 661.5KB
            repo2: backup set size: 8MB, backup size: 28KB
            backup reference list: 20210419-142414F
```

The **'wal archive min/max'** shows the minimum and maximum WAL currently stored in the archive and, in the case of multiple repositories, will be reported across all repositories unless the `--repo` option is set. There may be gaps due to archive retention policies or other reasons.

Let us break the first repository by removing its content:

```bash
$ pgbackrest --stanza=demo stanza-delete --repo=1 --force
P00   INFO: stanza-delete command end: completed successfully

$ pgbackrest --stanza=demo stanza-create
P00   INFO: stanza-create for stanza 'demo' on repo1
P00   INFO: stanza-create for stanza 'demo' on repo2
P00   INFO: stanza 'demo' already exists on repo2 and is valid
P00   INFO: stanza-create command end: completed successfully
```

If multiple repositories are configured, then a status of **mixed** indicates that the stanza is not in a healthy state for one or more of the repositories. In this case, the state of the stanza will be detailed in additional lines per repository.

```bash
$ pgbackrest info --stanza=demo
stanza: demo
    status: mixed
        repo1: error (no valid backups)
        repo2: ok
    cipher: none

    db (current)
        wal archive min/max (13): 00000001000000000000000E/000000010000000000000012

        full backup: 20210419-142414F
            timestamp start/stop: 2021-04-19 14:24:14 / 2021-04-19 14:24:26
            wal start/stop: 00000001000000000000000E / 00000001000000000000000E
            database size: 50.5MB, database backup size: 50.5MB
            repo2: backup set size: 8MB, backup size: 8MB

        incr backup: 20210419-142414F_20210419-142556I
            timestamp start/stop: 2021-04-19 14:25:56 / 2021-04-19 14:25:57
            wal start/stop: 000000010000000000000012 / 000000010000000000000012
            database size: 50.6MB, database backup size: 661.5KB
            repo2: backup set size: 8MB, backup size: 28KB
            backup reference list: 20210419-142414F
```

This state can be resolved by taking a new backup:

```bash
$ pgbackrest backup --stanza=demo --type=full --repo=1
P00   INFO: backup command begin ...
P00   INFO: execute non-exclusive pg_start_backup(): backup begins after the requested immediate checkpoint completes
P00   INFO: backup start archive = 000000010000000000000014, lsn = 0/14000028

P00   INFO: execute non-exclusive pg_stop_backup() and wait for all WAL segments to archive
P00   INFO: backup stop archive = 000000010000000000000014, lsn = 0/14000138

P00   INFO: new backup label = 20210419-143400F
P00   INFO: backup command end: completed successfully
```


### Restore

Let us initiate a situation with some data, backups and restore point:

```bash
$ createdb test
$ psql -d test -c "CREATE TABLE t1(id int);"
CREATE TABLE
$ psql -d test -c "INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1);"
INSERT 0 1

As you can see in the example above, the `backup` command automatically triggered the `expire` command on the repository when we created a backup. Since this command is operating on one repository only, it would not expire anything in the other repositories until the `backup` or `expire` command is run for that repository.

Since the default retention policy is based on a number of backups, it is expected that only new backups are affecting the backups and archives to expire.

#### Restore Command

The restore command automatically defaults to selecting the latest backup from the first repository where backups exist. The order in which the repositories are checked is dictated by order of the repositories as configured in the `pgbackrest.conf` (e.g. repo1 will be checked before repo2). To restore from from a specific repository, the `--repo` option can be used.

PITR can be performed by specifying `--type=time` and specifying the target time with `--target`. If a backup is not specified via the `--set` option, then the configured repositories will be checked for a backup that contains the requested time. If no backup can be found, the latest backup from the first repository containing backups will be used.

```bash
$ mkdir /tmp/restored_data
$ pgbackrest restore --stanza=demo --target="RP1" --type=name --no-delta --pg1-path=/tmp/restored_data
P00   INFO: repo1: restore backup set 20210419-143643F

$ rm -rf /tmp/restored_data/*
$ pgbackrest restore --stanza=demo --target="2021-04-19 14:38:55.313716+00:00" --type=time --no-delta --pg1-path=/tmp/restored_data
HINT: time format must be YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS with optional msec and optional timezone (+/- HH or HHMM or HH:MM) 
	- if timezone is omitted, local time is assumed (for UTC use +00)
P00   INFO: repo1: restore backup set 20210419-143643F

$ rm -rf /tmp/restored_data/* 
$ pgbackrest restore --stanza=demo --target="RP1" --type=name --no-delta --pg1-path=/tmp/restored_data --repo=2
P00   INFO: repo2: restore backup set 20210419-143749F
```

Even if the backup in **repo2** is newer, the first found match is preserved. Let's take a new backup in **repo1** to check if pgBackRest will auto-select the backup in **repo2**:

```

The recovery process may be complex and tricky depending on the target, and therefore, the `info` command can really be helpful to determine the repository to restore from.

#### Archive Get Command

When multiple repositories are configured, WAL will be fetched from the repositories in priority order (e.g. `repo1`, `repo2`, etc.). In general it is better if faster storage has higher priority. The command can operate on a single repository by specifying it with the `--repo` option.

```bash
root# systemctl stop edb-as-13.service
$ mv /var/lib/edb/as13/data /var/lib/edb/as13/data.orig
$ mkdir -m 700 /var/lib/edb/as13/data

$ pgbackrest restore --stanza=demo --target="2021-04-19 14:38:55.313716+00:00" --type=time --no-delta --target-action=promote
P00   INFO: restore command begin ...

P00   INFO: restore command end: completed successfully

$ cat /var/lib/edb/as13/data/postgresql.auto.conf|grep restore_command
restore_command = 'pgbackrest --stanza=demo archive-get %f "%p"'

root# systemctl start edb-as-13.service
$ cat /var/lib/edb/as13/data/log/edb-2021-04-19_145147.log

/var/lib/edb/as13/backups/repo2/archive/demo/13-1/00000002.history
```

PostgreSQL found the WALs needed for recovery in our **repo2**, picked a new timeline and pushed the history file to the repositories.

Whenever a new timeline is created, PostgreSQL creates a timeline history file that shows which timeline it branched off from and when. These history files are necessary to allow the system to pick the right WAL segment files when recovering from a backup that contains multiple timelines.

```bash
root# systemctl stop edb-as-13.service
$ rm -rf /var/lib/edb/as13/data/*
$ rm -rf /var/lib/edb/as13/backups/repo1/archive/demo/13-1/00000002.history
$ pgbackrest restore --stanza=demo --target="2021-04-19 14:38:55.313716+00:00" --type=time --target-timeline=current --no-delta --target-action=promote
P00   INFO: restore command begin ...
P00   INFO: repo2: restore backup set 20210419-143749F
P00   INFO: write updated /var/lib/edb/as13/data/postgresql.auto.conf

P00   INFO: restore command end: completed successfully

root# systemctl start edb-as-13.service
$ cat /var/lib/edb/as13/data/log/edb-2021-04-19_145721.log
P00   INFO: found 00000002.history in the repo2: 13-1 archive
P00   INFO: unable to find 00000003.history in the archive
LOG:  selected new timeline ID: 3
P00   INFO: pushed WAL file '00000003.history' to the archive
```

As shown above, since the history file is stored within the same repository as the restored backup set, PostgreSQL is able to pick a new and accurate timeline.

Let us now retry after moving the history file to **repo1**.

```bash
root# systemctl stop edb-as-13.service
$ rm -rf /var/lib/edb/as13/data/*
$ mv /var/lib/edb/as13/backups/repo2/archive/demo/13-1/00000002.history /var/lib/edb/as13/backups/repo1/archive/demo/13-1/00000002.history
$ pgbackrest restore --stanza=demo --target="2021-04-19 14:38:55.313716+00:00" --type=time --target-timeline=current --no-delta --target-action=promote
root# systemctl start edb-as-13.service
$ cat /var/lib/edb/as13/data/log/edb-2021-04-19_150037.log
P00   INFO: found 00000002.history in the repo1: 13-1 archive
P00   INFO: found 00000003.history in the repo1: 13-1 archive
P00   INFO: unable to find 00000004.history in the archive
LOG:  selected new timeline ID: 4
P00   INFO: pushed WAL file '00000004.history' to the archive
```

As we can see, both `00000002.history` and `00000003.history` have been found in **repo1** so PostgreSQL could pick the next timeline correctly, even if the restored backup set came from **repo2**.

When using multiple repositories, the `archive-get` command will tolerate gaps in one repository (due to lack of disk space e.g.) mainly because it will still be able to find the missing files in the other repository.
