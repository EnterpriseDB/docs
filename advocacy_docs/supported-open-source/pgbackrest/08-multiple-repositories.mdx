title: 'Multiple Repositories'
description: "Deeper look at the multiple repositories support feature"
---

The multiple repositories support was added in the [v2.33](https://github.com/pgbackrest/pgbackrest/releases/tag/release%2F2.33) release. One example where multiple repositories could be used, would be for situations where a local repository would have minimal retention (for fast restores), and a remote repository would have a longer retention (for redundancy and access across the enterprise).

A new [`--repo`](https://pgbackrest.org/configuration.html#section-repository/option-repo) option has been added to set the repository for a command to operate on. All `repo*-` options are indexed to allow for configuring multiple repositories.

In this section, we'll setup a **demo** cluster (using **EDB Postgres Advanced Server** 13 on CentOS 7) to demonstrate how each pgBackRest command reacts to this new feature.


### Configuration

For the purpose of this demonstration, we'll setup two local repositories on our database host. This is **not recommended** for production purpose.

```ini
[global]
# repository details
repo1-path=/var/lib/edb/as13/backups/repo1
repo1-retention-full=1
repo2-path=/var/lib/edb/as13/backups/repo2
repo2-retention-full=1

# general options
process-max=2
log-level-console=info
log-level-file=debug
start-fast=y
delta=y

[demo]
pg1-path=/var/lib/edb/as13/data
pg1-user=enterprisedb
pg1-port=5444
```

For safety reasons, the `--repo` option can't be defined in the configuration file or a warning will be triggered: `WARN: configuration file contains command-line only option 'repo'`. If there is more than one repository configured and the `--repo` option is not specified for a command, the repositories will be acted upon in highest priority order (e.g. `repo1` then `repo2`).

> **_NOTE:_** this new `--repo` option is not required when only `repo1` is configured in order to maintain backward compatibility. However, when a single repository is configured, it is recommended to use `repo1` in the configuration.


### Initialization

#### Stanza Create Command

The `stanza-create` command will automatically work with all configured repositories:

```bash
$ pgbackrest --stanza=demo stanza-create
P00   INFO: stanza-create for stanza 'demo' on repo1
P00   INFO: stanza-create for stanza 'demo' on repo2
```

#### Check Command

The `check` command will trigger a new WAL segment to be archived and try to push it to all defined repositories:

```bash
$ pgbackrest --stanza=demo check
P00   INFO: check repo1 configuration (primary)
P00   INFO: check repo2 configuration (primary)
P00   INFO: check repo1 archive for WAL (primary)
P00   INFO: WAL segment ... successfully archived to '...' on repo1
P00   INFO: check repo2 archive for WAL (primary)
P00   INFO: WAL segment ... successfully archived to '...' on repo2
```


### Backups

#### Archive Push Command

The `archive-push` command will always archive WALs in all configured repositories but backups will need to be scheduled individually for each repository. In many cases this is desirable since backup types and retention will vary by repository.

The `archive_command` can still be defined as usual:

```bash
$ psql -d postgres -c "show archive_command;"
             archive_command              
------------------------------------------
 pgbackrest --stanza=demo archive-push %p
(1 row)
```

Here's a `DEBUG` extract of the PostgreSQL logs showing the `archive-push` activity:

```
...
P00  DEBUG:     storage/storage::storageNewWrite: => {
	type: posix, name: {"/var/lib/edb/as13/backups/repo1/archive/demo/13-1/0000000100000000/
							000000010000000000000005-be9a61a800934879842fa647b0d50385f44e0228.gz"}, 
	modeFile: 0640, modePath: 0750, createPath: true, syncFile: true, syncPath: true, atomic: true}
...
P00  DEBUG:     storage/storage::storageNewWrite: => {
	type: posix, name: {"/var/lib/edb/as13/backups/repo2/archive/demo/13-1/0000000100000000/
							000000010000000000000005-be9a61a800934879842fa647b0d50385f44e0228.gz"}, 
	modeFile: 0640, modePath: 0750, createPath: true, syncFile: true, syncPath: true, atomic: true}
...
P00   INFO: pushed WAL file '000000010000000000000005' to the archive
```

The `archive-push` command will try to push the WAL archive to all reachable repositories. The idea is to archive to as many repositories as possible even if we still need to throw an error to PostgreSQL to prevent it from removing the WAL file.

```
P00   INFO: archive-push command begin: [pg_wal/000000010000000000000006] ...
...
P00   INFO: archive-push command begin: [pg_wal/000000010000000000000007] ...
ERROR: [104]: archive-push command encountered error(s):
       repo2: [PathOpenError] unable to list file info for path '...': [13] Permission denied
P00   INFO: archive-push command end: aborted with exception [104]
DETAIL:  The failed archive command was: pgbackrest --stanza=demo archive-push pg_wal/000000010000000000000007
WARNING:  archiving write-ahead log file "000000010000000000000007" failed too many times, will try again later
```

The PostgreSQL `archiver` process should then report an error:

```bash
$ ps -o pid,cmd fx |grep archiver
 4440  \_ postgres: archiver failed on 000000010000000000000007
```

The next WAL segments shouldn't then be archived:

```bash
$ psql -d postgres -c "SELECT pg_create_restore_point('generate some activity'); SELECT pg_switch_wal();"
 pg_switch_wal 
---------------
 0/80001C8
(1 row)

$ ls as13/data/pg_wal/archive_status/ |grep ".ready"
000000010000000000000007.ready
000000010000000000000008.ready
```

This becomes very handy by adding `archive-async=y` to the configuration in order to use asynchronous archiving processes within pgBackRest itself. Even if PostgreSQL `archiver` process is still stuck, the archives will reach the working repositories:

```bash
$ $ ls /var/lib/edb/as13/backups/repo1/archive/demo/13-1/0000000100000000/
000000010000000000000005-be9a61a800934879842fa647b0d50385f44e0228.gz
000000010000000000000006-7108296955e1208c93447dcfc5712ce59af97907.gz
000000010000000000000007-f1b6fcdd23e96a19a7a89dc92613674c2316aa49.gz
000000010000000000000008-791c44d39ef772d58e51d64c8e3589231d3916a4.gz
000000010000000000000009-47241214eb3fd5e693eed778caa7b304a778ecc2.gz

$ ls /var/lib/edb/as13/backups/repo2/archive/demo/13-1/0000000100000000/
000000010000000000000005-be9a61a800934879842fa647b0d50385f44e0228.gz

```

Let's unblock the `archiver` process (and remove asynchronous archiving) before going further:

```bash
$ $ ps -o pid,cmd fx |grep archiver
 4440  \_ postgres: archiver last was 00000001000000000000000
```

#### Backup Command

Let's take some backups:

```

Here, we alternated `full` and `incr` backups in each repository.


#### Info Command

```bash
$ pgbackrest info --stanza=demo
stanza: demo
    status: ok
    cipher: none

    db (current)
        wal archive min/max (13): 000000010000000000000002/000000010000000000000012

        full backup: 20210419-142212F
            timestamp start/stop: 2021-04-19 14:22:12 / 2021-04-19 14:22:26
            wal start/stop: 00000001000000000000000C / 00000001000000000000000C

            wal start/stop: 00000001000000000000000E / 00000001000000000000000E
            database size: 50.5MB, database backup size: 50.5MB
            repo2: backup set size: 8MB, backup size: 8MB

        incr backup: 20210419-142212F_20210419-142502I
            timestamp start/stop: 2021-04-19 14:25:02 / 2021-04-19 14:25:04
            wal start/stop: 000000010000000000000010 / 000000010000000000000010

            repo1: backup set size: 8MB, backup size: 26.3KB
            backup reference list: 20210419-142212F

        incr backup: 20210419-142414F_20210419-142556I
            timestamp start/stop: 2021-04-19 14:25:56 / 2021-04-19 14:25:57
            wal start/stop: 000000010000000000000012 / 000000010000000000000012
            database size: 50.6MB, database backup size: 661.5KB
            repo2: backup set size: 8MB, backup size: 28KB
            backup reference list: 20210419-142414F

```

The default order will sort backups by dates mixing the repositories. It might be confusing to find the backups depending on each other.

We can then split this view per repository:

```bash
$ pgbackrest info --stanza=demo --repo=1
stanza: demo
    status: ok
    cipher: none

    db (current)
        wal archive min/max (13): 00000001000000000000000C/000000010000000000000012

        full backup: 20210419-142212F
            timestamp start/stop: 2021-04-19 14:22:12 / 2021-04-19 14:22:26
            wal start/stop: 00000001000000000000000C / 00000001000000000000000C
            database size: 50.4MB, database backup size: 50.4MB
            repo1: backup set size: 8MB, backup size: 8MB

        incr backup: 20210419-142212F_20210419-142502I
            timestamp start/stop: 2021-04-19 14:25:02 / 2021-04-19 14:25:04
            wal start/stop: 000000010000000000000010 / 000000010000000000000010
            database size: 50.5MB, database backup size: 613.4KB
            repo1: backup set size: 8MB, backup size: 26.3KB
            backup reference list: 20210419-142212F

$ pgbackrest info --stanza=demo --repo=2
stanza: demo
    status: ok
    cipher: none

    db (current)
        wal archive min/max (13): 00000001000000000000000E/000000010000000000000012

        full backup: 20210419-142414F
            timestamp start/stop: 2021-04-19 14:24:14 / 2021-04-19 14:24:26
            wal start/stop: 00000001000000000000000E / 00000001000000000000000E
            database size: 50.5MB, database backup size: 50.5MB
            repo2: backup set size: 8MB, backup size: 8MB

        incr backup: 20210419-142414F_20210419-142556I
            timestamp start/stop: 2021-04-19 14:25:56 / 2021-04-19 14:25:57
            wal start/stop: 000000010000000000000012 / 000000010000000000000012
            database size: 50.6MB, database backup size: 661.5KB
            repo2: backup set size: 8MB, backup size: 28KB
            backup reference list: 20210419-142414F
```

The **'wal archive min/max'** shows the minimum and maximum WAL currently stored in the archive and, in the case of multiple repositories, will be reported across all repositories unless the `--repo` option is set. Note that there may be gaps due to archive retention policies or other reasons.

Let's break our first repository by removing its content:

```bash
$ pgbackrest --stanza=demo stanza-delete --repo=1 --force
P00   INFO: stanza-delete command end: completed successfully

$ pgbackrest --stanza=demo stanza-create
P00   INFO: stanza-create for stanza 'demo' on repo1
P00   INFO: stanza-create for stanza 'demo' on repo2
P00   INFO: stanza 'demo' already exists on repo2 and is valid
P00   INFO: stanza-create command end: completed successfully
```

If there are multiple repositories, then a status of **'mixed'** indicates that the stanza is not in a healthy state on one or more of the repositories. In this case the state of the stanza will be detailed on additional lines per repository. 

```bash
$ pgbackrest info --stanza=demo
stanza: demo
    status: mixed
        repo1: error (no valid backups)
        repo2: ok
    cipher: none

    db (current)
        wal archive min/max (13): 00000001000000000000000E/000000010000000000000012

        full backup: 20210419-142414F
            timestamp start/stop: 2021-04-19 14:24:14 / 2021-04-19 14:24:26
            wal start/stop: 00000001000000000000000E / 00000001000000000000000E
            database size: 50.5MB, database backup size: 50.5MB
            repo2: backup set size: 8MB, backup size: 8MB

        incr backup: 20210419-142414F_20210419-142556I
            timestamp start/stop: 2021-04-19 14:25:56 / 2021-04-19 14:25:57
            wal start/stop: 000000010000000000000012 / 000000010000000000000012
            database size: 50.6MB, database backup size: 661.5KB
            repo2: backup set size: 8MB, backup size: 28KB
            backup reference list: 20210419-142414F
```

Fix it by taking a new backup:

```bash
$ pgbackrest backup --stanza=demo --type=full --repo=1
P00   INFO: backup command begin ...
P00   INFO: execute non-exclusive pg_start_backup(): backup begins after the requested immediate checkpoint completes

P00   INFO: backup command end: completed successfully
```


### Restore

Let's initiate a nice situation with some data, backups and restore point:

```bash
$ createdb test
$ psql -d test -c "CREATE TABLE t1(id int);"
CREATE TABLE
$ psql -d test -c "INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (1);"
INSERT 0 1

$ pgbackrest backup --stanza=demo --type=full --repo=1

As you can see in the example above, the `backup` command automatically triggers the `expire` command on the repository where we took our backup. That means it won't expire anything in the other repositories unless you request a new backup there or execute the `expire` command manually.

Since the default retention policy is based on a number of backups, it is safe and healthy that only new backups are affecting the backups and archives to expire.

#### Restore Command

The restore command automatically defaults to selecting the latest backup from the first repository where backups exist. The order in which the repositories are checked is dictated by the `pgbackrest.conf` (e.g. repo1 will be checked before repo2). To select from a specific repository, the `--repo` option can be passed.

For PITR, `--type=time` must be provided and the target time specified with the `--target` option. If a backup is not specified via the `--set` option, then the configured repositories will be checked for a backup that contains the requested time. If no backup can be found, the latest backup from the first repository containing backups will be used.

```bash
$ mkdir /tmp/restored_data
$ pgbackrest restore --stanza=demo --target="RP1" --type=name --no-delta --pg1-path=/tmp/restored_data
P00   INFO: repo1: restore backup set 20210419-143643F

$ rm -rf /tmp/restored_data/*
$ pgbackrest restore --stanza=demo --target="2021-04-19 14:38:55.313716+00:00" --type=time --no-delta --pg1-path=/tmp/restored_data
HINT: time format must be YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS with optional msec and optional timezone (+/- HH or HHMM or HH:MM) 
	- if timezone is omitted, local time is assumed (for UTC use +00)
P00   INFO: repo1: restore backup set 20210419-143643F

$ rm -rf /tmp/restored_data/* 
$ pgbackrest restore --stanza=demo --target="RP1" --type=name --no-delta --pg1-path=/tmp/restored_data --repo=2
P00   INFO: repo2: restore backup set 20210419-143749F
```

Even if the backup in **repo2** is newer, the first match found for our time target is kept. Let's take a new backup in **repo1** to check if pgBackRest will auto-select the backup in **repo2**:

$ pgbackrest backup --stanza=demo --type=full --repo=1

```

The recovery process might be touchy and the `info` command will really be helpful for you to chose the repository from which the restored data should be restored.

#### Archive Get Command

When multiple repositories are configured, WAL will be fetched from the repositories in priority order (e.g. `repo1`, `repo2`, etc.). In general it is better if faster storage has higher priority. When a repository is specified with the `--repo` option, only that repository will be searched.

/var/lib/edb/as13/backups/repo2/archive/demo/13-1/00000002.history
```

PostgreSQL found the WALs needed for recovery in our **repo2**, picked a new timeline and pushed the history file to the repositories. 

```bash
root# systemctl stop edb-as-13.service
$ rm -rf /var/lib/edb/as13/data/*
$ rm -rf /var/lib/edb/as13/backups/repo1/archive/demo/13-1/00000002.history

P00   INFO: pushed WAL file '00000003.history' to the archive
```

Let's retry it by moving the history file in **repo1** now.

```bash
root# systemctl stop edb-as-13.service
$ rm -rf /var/lib/edb/as13/data/*
$ mv /var/lib/edb/as13/backups/repo2/archive/demo/13-1/00000002.history /var/lib/edb/as13/backups/repo1/archive/demo/13-1/00000002.history
$ pgbackrest restore --stanza=demo --target="2021-04-19 14:38:55.313716+00:00" --type=time --target-timeline=current --no-delta --target-action=promote
root# systemctl start edb-as-13.service
$ cat /var/lib/edb/as13/data/log/edb-2021-04-19_150037.log
P00   INFO: found 00000002.history in the repo1: 13-1 archive
P00   INFO: found 00000003.history in the repo1: 13-1 archive
P00   INFO: unable to find 00000004.history in the archive
LOG:  selected new timeline ID: 4
P00   INFO: pushed WAL file '00000004.history' to the archive
```

As we can see above, both `00000002.history` and `00000003.history` have been found in **repo1** so PostgreSQL could pick the next timeline correctly.

The `archive-get` enhancement will tolerate gaps in one repository (due to lack of disk space e.g.) mainly because it will still be able to find the missing files in the other repository.
