description: "How to configure a non-superuser as the pgBackRest user"
---

pgBackRest supports non-superuser backups and restores. This feature is useful when you want to delegate backup and restore tasks to non-superusers. To configure non-superuser support, you need to grant the necessary permissions to the non-superuser.

For example, to allow the `pgbackrest` user to perform backups and restores, you can grant the following permissions:

```sql
grant pg_read_all_settings to pgbackrest ;
```

For EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14 and later:

```sql
GRANT EXECUTE on FUNCTION pg_switch_wal to pgbackrest;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_start_backup(text, boolean, boolean) to pgbackrest;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_stop_backup(boolean, boolean) TO pgbackrest;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_catalog.pg_create_restore_point(text) TO pgbackrest;
```

For EDB Postgres Advanced Server 15 and later, additionally to the permissions granted above, also include: 

```sql
GRANT pg_checkpoint TO pgbackrest;
```

For EDB Postgres 15 and later:

In EDB Postgres 15 and later versions, `pg_start_backup` and `pg_stop_backup` functions are changed to `pg_backup_start` and `pg_backup_stop`.

```sql

GRANT EXECUTE on FUNCTION pg_switch_wal to pgbackrest ;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_backup_start(label text, fast boolean) TO pgbackrest;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_backup_stop(wait_for_archive boolean) TO pgbackrest;
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_catalog.pg_create_restore_point(text) TO pgbackrest;
GRANT pg_checkpoint TO pgbackrest;
```

!!!note 
   For versions 15 and later, EDB recommends adding the `pg_checkpoint` role to the non-superuser as well. This allows them to utilize the [`start-fast=y`](/supported-open-source/pgbackrest/04-recommended_settings/#backup-fast-start) setting in pgBackRest, which triggers an immediate checkpoint at the start of the backup for quicker execution. Prior versions don't include the `pg_checkpoint` role.
