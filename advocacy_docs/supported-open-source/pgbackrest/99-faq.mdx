- Why do we have to specify the `--stanza` option even if only one stanza is defined in the configuration file?

Except for the repository specific commands (`info`, `start`, `stop`), the `--stanza` option is required so that adding a stanza does not cause the commands that did not have a stanza specified to suddenly throw errors because they do not know which stanza to use.

- Is it possible to only restore a specific database from a complete database cluster backup?

Yes. You can restore a specific database using the [restore `--db-include`](https://pgbackrest.org/command.html#command-restore/category-command/option-db-include) option. After recovery, you can then extract the selected databases with the [`pg_dump`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) command.

The databases that are not explicitly included with this option will be restored as sparse, zeroed files to save space; however, it still allows PostgreSQL to perform the recovery using less disk space. You can then remove these databases with the [`DROP DATABASE`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-dropdatabase.html) command since they will no longer be accessible.
