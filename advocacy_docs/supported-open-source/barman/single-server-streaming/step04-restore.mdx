In the previous step, [we created a full backup of the example database](step03-backup). But it's not a real backup until we've successfully restored it - so let's end with that. 

This demo is interactive. You can follow along right in your browser, using Katacoda, by clicking the button below.

!!! Note
    When you click "Start Now," Katacoda will load a Docker Compose environment with two container images representing a
    PostgreSQL 13 server with [the Pagila database](https://github.com/devrimgunduz/pagila) loaded (named `pg`)
    and a backup server for Barman.    
    
    Once you see a `barman@backup` prompt, you can follow the steps below.

<KatacodaPanel />

Something terrible has happened to our example database! This should list all the tables:

```shell
psql -h pg -d pagila -U barman -c '\dt'
__OUTPUT__
Did not find any relations.
```

All the data is gone! 

Ok, I just didn't populate the data for this step, in order to demonstrate a total loss. Fortunately, we still have a backup!

```shell
barman list-backup pg
```

Let's instruct Barman to ssh into the database server and restore the backup. 

1. Connect to pg and shut down the database cluster:

    ```shell
    ssh postgres@pg /usr/lib/postgresql/13/bin/pg_ctl \
        --pgdata=/var/lib/postgresql/data stop
    ```

2. Use [Barman's recover command](http://docs.pgbarman.org/release/2.12/#recover) to connect to pg and restore the latest backup 

    ```shell
    barman recover --remote-ssh-command 'ssh postgres@pg' \
            pg latest \
            /var/lib/postgresql/data
    ```

    Barman handles connecting to the destination server, but we do have to provide a valid path *on* that server. In this example, the PostgreSQL cluster lives in /var/lib/postgresql/data and we're asking Barman to overwrite it with the backup.

3. Restart the server:

    ```shell
    ssh postgres@pg /usr/lib/postgresql/13/bin/pg_ctl \
        --pgdata=/var/lib/postgresql/data start 
    ```

    (Hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> after that completes to regain control in the terminal)

Now we should be able to reconnect to the database:

```shell
psql -h pg -d pagila -U barman
__OUTPUT__
psql (13.2 (Ubuntu 13.2-1.pgdg20.04+1))
Type "help" for help.

pagila=#
```

...And re-run the query we started out with:

```sql
select * from actor where last_name='KILMER';
__OUTPUT__
 actor_id | first_name | last_name |      last_update       
----------+------------+-----------+------------------------
       23 | SANDRA     | KILMER    | 2020-02-15 09:34:33+00
       45 | REESE      | KILMER    | 2020-02-15 09:34:33+00
       55 | FAY        | KILMER    | 2020-02-15 09:34:33+00
      153 | MINNIE     | KILMER    | 2020-02-15 09:34:33+00
      162 | OPRAH      | KILMER    | 2020-02-15 09:34:33+00
(5 rows)
```

<!-- This needs barman-cli on the database server - which means I can't use the std postgresql image. TODO!

Ok, so far so good - but, we're missing the update we wrote to this data! Remember, that wasn't in the base backup, it was in a partial WAL file... Fortunately, Barman still has it and knows how to use it. 

Let's try this recovery process again:

1. Connect to pg and shut down the database cluster:

    ```shell
    ssh postgres@pg /usr/lib/postgresql/13/bin/pg_ctl \
        --pgdata=/var/lib/postgresql/data stop
    ```

2. Instruct Barman to connect to pg and restore the latest backup 
    ```shell
    barman recover --remote-ssh-command 'ssh postgres@pg' \
            --get-wal \
            pg latest \
            /var/lib/postgresql/data
    ```

3. Restart the server:

    ```shell
    ssh postgres@pg /usr/lib/postgresql/13/bin/pg_ctl \
        --pgdata=/var/lib/postgresql/data start &
    ```
-->

## Conclusion

This demonstration barely scratches the surface of what is possible with Barman, but hopefully it has provided you with a taste of its capabilities! For more details, visit https://pgbarman.org/
