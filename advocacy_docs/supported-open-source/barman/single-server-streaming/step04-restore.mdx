In the previous step, [we created a full backup of the example database](step03-backup). But it's not a real backup until we've successfully restored it - so let's end with that. 

!!!interactive This demo is interactive
    You can follow along right in your browser. When you click "Start Now," Katacoda will load a Docker Compose 
    environment with two container images representing a PostgreSQL 13 server with 
    [the Pagila database](https://github.com/devrimgunduz/pagila) loaded (named `pg`)
    and a backup server for Barman (named `backup`).

    Once you see a `barman@backup` prompt, you can follow the steps below.

<KatacodaPanel />

Something terrible has happened to our example database! This should list all the tables:

```shell
psql -h pg -d pagila -U barman -c '\dt'
__OUTPUT__
Did not find any relations.
```

All the data is gone! 

Ok, I just didn't populate the data for this step, in order to demonstrate a total loss. Fortunately, we still have a backup!

```shell
barman list-backup pg
```

Let's instruct Barman to ssh into the database server and restore the backup. 

1. Connect to pg and shut down the database cluster:

    ```shell
    ssh postgres@pg /usr/lib/postgresql/13/bin/pg_ctl \
        --pgdata=/var/lib/postgresql/data stop
    __OUTPUT__
    waiting for server to shut down.... done
    server stopped
    ```

2. Back up the corrupt data directory, just in case something goes wrong. Then delete the corrupt data.

    ```shell
    ssh postgres@pg "cp -a /var/lib/postgresql/data \
        /var/lib/postgresql/old_data \
        && rm -rf /var/lib/postgresql/data/*"
    ```

3. Use [Barman's recover command](http://docs.pgbarman.org/release/2.12/#recover) to connect to pg and restore the latest backup 

    ```shell
    barman recover --remote-ssh-command 'ssh postgres@pg' \
            pg latest \
            /var/lib/postgresql/data
    __OUTPUT__
    Starting remote restore for server pg using backup 20210330T040549
    Destination directory: /var/lib/postgresql/data
    Remote command: ssh postgres@pg
    Using safe horizon time for smart rsync copy: 2021-03-30 04:05:58+00:00
    Copying the base backup.
    Copying required WAL segments.
    Generating archive status files
    Identify dangerous settings in destination directory.

    Recovery completed (start time: 2021-03-31 02:29:23.555186, elapsed time: 1 second)

    Your PostgreSQL server has been successfully prepared for recovery!
    ```

    Barman handles connecting to the destination server, but we do have to provide a valid path *on* that server. In this example, the PostgreSQL cluster lives in /var/lib/postgresql/data and we're asking Barman to overwrite it with the backup.

4. Restart the server:

    ```shell
    ssh postgres@pg "/usr/lib/postgresql/13/bin/pg_ctl \
        --pgdata=/var/lib/postgresql/data \
        -l /var/log/postgresql/pg.log \
        start \
        ; tail /var/log/postgresql/pg.log"
    __OUTPUT__
    waiting for server to start.... done
    server started
    2021-03-31 02:29:12.761 UTC [2201] LOG:  database system is shut down

    2021-03-31 02:30:13.363 UTC [2515] LOG:  database system is ready to accept connections
    ```

Now we should be able to reconnect to the database:

```shell
psql -h pg -d pagila -U barman
__OUTPUT__
psql (13.2 (Ubuntu 13.2-1.pgdg20.04+1))
Type "help" for help.

pagila=#
```

...And re-run the query we started out with:

```sql
select * from actor where last_name='KILMER';
\q
__OUTPUT__
 actor_id | first_name | last_name |      last_update       
----------+------------+-----------+------------------------
       23 | SANDRA     | KILMER    | 2020-02-15 09:34:33+00
       45 | REESE      | KILMER    | 2020-02-15 09:34:33+00
       55 | FAY        | KILMER    | 2020-02-15 09:34:33+00
      153 | MINNIE     | KILMER    | 2020-02-15 09:34:33+00
      162 | OPRAH      | KILMER    | 2020-02-15 09:34:33+00
(5 rows)
```

Ok, so far so good - but, we're missing the update we wrote to this data! Remember, that wasn't in the base backup, it was in a partial WAL file... Fortunately, Barman still has it and knows how to use it. 

Let's try this recovery process again:

1. Connect to pg and shut down the database cluster:

    ```shell
    ssh postgres@pg /usr/lib/postgresql/13/bin/pg_ctl \
        --pgdata=/var/lib/postgresql/data stop
    ```

2. Back up the corrupt data directory, just in case something goes wrong. Then delete the corrupt data.

    ```shell
    ssh postgres@pg "cp -a /var/lib/postgresql/data \
        /var/lib/postgresql/old_data \
        && rm -rf /var/lib/postgresql/data/*"
    __OUTPUT__
    waiting for server to shut down.... done
    server stopped
    ```

3. Instruct Barman to connect to pg and restore the latest backup *with the `--get-wal` option* - this triggers WAL fetching, including partial WAL files, during the recovery process.
    ```shell
    barman recover --remote-ssh-command 'ssh postgres@pg' \
            --get-wal \
            pg latest \
            /var/lib/postgresql/data
    __OUTPUT__
    Starting remote restore for server pg using backup 20210330T040549
    Destination directory: /var/lib/postgresql/data
    Remote command: ssh postgres@pg
    Copying the base backup.
    Generating recovery configuration
    Identify dangerous settings in destination directory.

    WARNING: 'get-wal' is in the specified 'recovery_options'.
    Before you start up the PostgreSQL server, please review the postgresql.auto.conf file
    inside the target directory. Make sure that 'restore_command' can be executed by the PostgreSQL user.

    Recovery completed (start time: 2021-03-31 00:47:46.722740, elapsed time: 1 second)

    Your PostgreSQL server has been successfully prepared for recovery!
    ```

4. Restart the server:

    ```shell
    ssh postgres@pg "/usr/lib/postgresql/13/bin/pg_ctl \
        --pgdata=/var/lib/postgresql/data \
        -l /var/log/postgresql/pg.log \
        start \
        ; tail /var/log/postgresql/pg.log"
    __OUTPUT__
    waiting for server to start..... done
    server started

    ```

!!! Note about those errors...
    You may notice two lines starting with "ERROR:" mid-way through the recovery log. They're fine - that's just PostgreSQL scanning to make sure it has the most recent timeline.
    By going through this recovery, we've actually created a *new* timeline - in fact, if you were to run through the four steps above again, you'd see that now `00000002.history` is found and PostgreSQL goes looking for `00000003.history`... Try it!

    For more on PostgreSQL backup timelines, see [Continuous Archiving in the PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/continuous-archiving.html#BACKUP-TIMELINES).

Now check the data again:

```shell
psql -h pg -d pagila -U barman -c \
    "select * from actor where last_name='KILMER'"
__OUTPUT__
 actor_id | first_name | last_name |          last_update          
----------+------------+-----------+-------------------------------
       45 | REESE      | KILMER    | 2020-02-15 09:34:33+00
       55 | FAY        | KILMER    | 2020-02-15 09:34:33+00
      153 | MINNIE     | KILMER    | 2020-02-15 09:34:33+00
      162 | OPRAH      | KILMER    | 2020-02-15 09:34:33+00
       23 | ALOYSIUS   | KILMER    | 2021-03-30 04:06:55.101099+00

```

Good ol' Aloysius is back!

## Conclusion

This demonstration barely scratches the surface of what is possible with Barman, but hopefully it has provided you with a taste of its capabilities! For more details, visit https://pgbarman.org/
