With [the Barman server configured in our last step](step02-backup-setup), we can run a full backup (or "base backup").

This demo is interactive. You can follow along right in your browser, using Katacoda, by clicking the button below.

!!! Note
    When you click "Start Now," Katacoda will load a Docker Compose environment with two container images representing a
    PostgreSQL 13 server with [the Pagila database](https://github.com/devrimgunduz/pagila) loaded (named `pg`)
    and a backup server for Barman.    
    
    Once you see a `barman@backup` prompt, you can follow the steps below.

<KatacodaPanel />

To run a full backup, we use [Barman's `backup` command](http://docs.pgbarman.org/release/2.12/#backup):

```shell
barman backup pg --wait
__OUTPUT__
Starting backup using postgres method for server pg in /var/lib/barman/pg/base/20210226T003857
Backup start at LSN: 0/23EA6C0 (000000010000000000000002, 003EA6C0)
Starting backup copy via pg_basebackup for 20210226T003857
Copy done (time: 1 second)
Finalising the backup.
This is the first backup for server pg
WAL segments preceding the current backup have been found:
        000000010000000000000002 from server pg has been removed
Backup size: 38.5 MiB
Backup end at LSN: 0/4000000 (000000010000000000000003, 00000000)
Backup completed (start time: 2021-02-26 00:38:57.535973, elapsed time: 2 seconds)
Waiting for the WAL file 000000010000000000000003 from server 'pg'
Processing xlog segments from streaming for pg
        000000010000000000000002
        000000010000000000000003
```

This will wait to recieve the next WAL file to ensure the backup is complete before the command returns.

Verify that it completed by listing backups for the server:

```shell
barman list-backup pg
__OUTPUT__
pg 20210226T003857 - Fri Feb 26 00:38:59 2021 - Size: 54.5 MiB - WAL Size: 0 B
```
(the timestamps will be different for you)

<!-- This needs barman-cli on the database server - which means I can't use the std postgresql image. TODO!

Of course, we've configured streaming backups - so we shouldn't need to depend on having a base backup for every change made to the database. Let's make a small modification to the data and verify that it arrives. 

First, log into the database (we'll use our barman user for convenience in this demonstration):

```shell
psql -h pg -d pagila -U barman
```

Then make a modifications, and view the results:

```sql
Update actor Set first_name='ALOYSIUS' where actor_id=23;
Select * From actor Where last_name='KILMER';
/q
```

Ok, let's see if it showed up:

```shell
grep 'ALOYSIUS' pg/streaming/*
```

There it is! The current WAL segment hasn't been rotated yet, but we have the most recent data in the *partial* WAL streamed to Barman. So in theory, nothing would be lost of something *terrible* happened to the database right now... 

--->

Now, the crucial question with backups is always the same: "can you get the data *back?*"

We'll answer this in [Step #4: Restoring a Backup](step04-restore).
