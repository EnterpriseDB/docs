In this step, we'll configure a PostgreSQL server, preparing it to be backed up using Barman.

!!!interactive This demo is interactive
    You can follow along right in your browser. When you click "Start Now," Katacoda will load a Docker Compose 
    environment with two container images representing a PostgreSQL 13 server with 
    [the Pagila database](https://github.com/devrimgunduz/pagila) loaded (named `pg`)
    and a backup server for Barman (named `backup`).

    Once you see a `postgres@pg` prompt, you can follow the steps below.

<KatacodaPanel />

For Barman to back up this server, a few things need to be done to prepare it:

1. Installing the Barman CLI tools
2. Creating a dedicated superuser for Barman to connect as
3. Creating a dedicated streaming user with the replication attribute and remote login permissions
4. Ensuring there are free replication slots

### Barman CLI installation

We'll start by installing the barman-cli package: this contains the [`barman-wal-archive`](http://docs.pgbarman.org/release/2.12/barman-wal-archive.1.html) and [`barman-wal-restore`](http://docs.pgbarman.org/release/2.12/barman-wal-restore.1.html) commands that will be used to transmit data to and from our backup server.

Since PostgreSQL is already installed, [the PostgreSQL apt repository](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt) is already configured and we can just request the package:

```shell
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install barman-cli
__OUTPUT__
...
Setting up barman-cli-cloud (2.12-1.pgdg100+1) ...
Processing triggers for ca-certificates (20200601~deb10u2) ...
Updating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs...
0 added, 0 removed; done.
Running hooks in /etc/ca-certificates/update.d...
done.
```

!!! Tip Further reading
    For more details on this package and installation instructions for other supported platforms, see: [the Barman client utilities section in the Barman guide](http://docs.pgbarman.org/release/2.12/index.html#barman-client-utilities-barman-cli).

### User provisioning

Let's call our dedicated backup user, "barman". We'll create it interactively via the [`createuser`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-createuser.html) utility:

```shell
createuser --superuser --replication -P barman
__OUTPUT__
Enter password for new role:
Enter it again:
```

Enter `example-password` when prompted (twice).

!!! Note Make note of that password
    We'll need to add it to the ~/.pgpass file on the backup server later!

We're making this a superuser account, which will allow it full control of all databases on this server. **Be very careful** with superuser credentials! Anyone who can connect as a superuser account owns your data.

Now we will create the streaming replication user, "streaming_barman". This doesn't need to be a superuser, but it does need the replication attribute:

```shell
createuser --replication -P streaming_barman
__OUTPUT__
Enter password for new role:
Enter it again:
```

Enter `example-password` when prompted (twice).

We'll also need to edit `pg_hba.conf` to allow the streaming user to connect from the backup server, by [explicitly allowing it to connect in replication mode](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html):

```shell
sed -i '$ a host   replication    streaming_barman   all md5' /var/lib/postgresql/data/pg_hba.conf
cat /var/lib/postgresql/data/pg_hba.conf
__OUTPUT__
...
local   replication     all                                     trust
host    replication     all             127.0.0.1/32            trust
host    replication     all             ::1/128                 trust

host all all all md5
host   replication    streaming_barman   all md5
```

### Database settings for streaming

We'll also need to make sure there are replication slots available, and that PostgreSQL will allow another sender to connect. We'll use psql to check the current settings:

```shell
psql -d pagila
```

```sql
Show max_wal_senders;
Show max_replication_slots;
__OUTPUT__
 max_wal_senders
-----------------
 10
(1 row)

 max_replication_slots
-----------------------
 10
(1 row)
```

The default for both of these (for PostgreSQL 10 and above) is 10, so we're fine - but if we needed more (or if they'd been previously set to 0, thus [disabling replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-replication.html)) then we'd need to increase them.


### Gazing fondly at data

Before we end, let's query some data - this is what we're going to back up!

```sql
select * from actor where last_name='KILMER';
\q
__OUTPUT__
 actor_id | first_name | last_name |      last_update
----------+------------+-----------+------------------------
       23 | SANDRA     | KILMER    | 2020-02-15 09:34:33+00
       45 | REESE      | KILMER    | 2020-02-15 09:34:33+00
       55 | FAY        | KILMER    | 2020-02-15 09:34:33+00
      153 | MINNIE     | KILMER    | 2020-02-15 09:34:33+00
      162 | OPRAH      | KILMER    | 2020-02-15 09:34:33+00
(5 rows)
```

We'll verify later on that this can be restored reliably.
