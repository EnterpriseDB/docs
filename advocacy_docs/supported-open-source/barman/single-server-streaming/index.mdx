This section demonstrates setting up a backup and recovery scenario using a Barman server and a PostgreSQL server. It covers:

1. Configuring the database server to allow Barman to collect data via streaming replication
2. Installing and configuring Barman for streaming replication and testing that configuration
3. Running a full backup
4. Restoring a full backup

Each of these steps is interactive, with the prerequisites and results of the previous step captured in a Docker image. You can work through the entire scenario in order, or skip to the step that interests you.
