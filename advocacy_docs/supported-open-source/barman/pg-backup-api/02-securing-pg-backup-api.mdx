### Overview

This guide covers the steps necessary to enable secure remote access to Postgres backup API.
This is achieved by installing Apache HTTP Server and configuring it to proxy traffic to Postgres backup API.
Apache HTTP Server will also handle the following:

* TLS termination, so that all connections between the Barman server and the outside world are encrypted.
* Certificate authentication, so that only clients with authorized keys and certificates can access Postgres backup API.

Once completed you will be able to use a client key and certificate to authenticate to Postgres backup API over an encrypted TLS connection.

### Prerequisites

You must already have installed [Barman](https://docs.pgbarman.org/#installation) and [Postgres backup API](01-installation) via your system package manager.

### Installing Apache HTTP Server

The first step is to install Apache HTTP Server on the server where Barman and Postgres backup API are installed.

#### Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get install apache2
```

#### RHEL

```bash
sudo yum install httpd mod_ssl
```

#### SLES

```bash
sudo zypper install apache2
```

### Initial Apache HTTP Server configuration

Once installed you should stop Apache HTTP Server from listening on port 80 and carry out platform-specific configuration tasks.

#### Debian/Ubuntu

Stop Apache HTTP Server from listening on port 80:

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/^Listen 80$/#Listen 80/' /etc/apache2/ports.conf
```

Enable the ssl, proxy and proxy_http modules in the correct order and restart Apache HTTP Server:

```bash
sudo a2enmod ssl
sudo a2enmod proxy
sudo a2enmod proxy_http
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

#### RHEL

Stop Apache HTTP Server from listening on port 80:

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/^Listen 80$/#Listen 80/' /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
```

Reload the configuration:

```bash
sudo systemctl reload httpd
```

#### SLES

Stop Apache HTTP Server from listening on port 80 and start listening on 443 instead:

```bash
sudo sed -i 's/^Listen 80$/Listen 443/' /etc/apache2/listen.conf
```

Enable the proxy and proxy_http modules in the correct order:

```bash
sudo a2enmod proxy
sudo a2enmod proxy_http
```

Restart Apache HTTP Server:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

### Obtaining server and client certificates

In order to configure Apache HTTP Server for TLS encryption you will need a private key and a certificate signed by a trusted certificate authority (CA).
You will also need a client certificate which has been signed by the same CA which signed the server certificate.

!!! Note
    You are of course free to use certificates obtained via other means and configure them however you like.
    For example your organization may have an internal CA you can use, or you may wish to use a third party CA.
    Such configurations are not covered by this guide.

In the following steps a number of placeholder variables are used:

* `$ORGANIZATION_NAME`: The organization name for your certificates.
* `$SERVER_FQDN`: The fully qualified domain name of the Barman server.
* `$ADMIN_EMAIL_ADDRESS`: The e-mail address used in the `emailAddress` x509 attribute.
* `$CLIENT_CN`: The x509 common name for the client application / host.

!!! Note
    On Ubuntu 18.04 only you will need to comment out `RANDFILE` in `/etc/ssl/openssl.cnf` to avoid errors relating to the use of a `$HOME/.rnd` file.
    This can be achieved with `sudo sed -i -e s/^RANDFILE/#RANDFILE/ /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf`.

Firstly, generate a self-signed CA as follows:

```bash
sudo openssl req -nodes -new -x509 -days 999 \
  -keyout /root/ca.key -out /root/ca.cert \
  -subj "/O=$ORGANIZATION_NAME/CN=root.$SERVER_FQDN/emailAddress=$ADMIN_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
```

This will generate a CA key and self-signed certificate which will be stored in the `/root` directory on the Barman server.

Now you can create a server key and use it to obtain a certificate signed by the CA you just created.
Firstly create the key:

```bash
sudo openssl genrsa -out /root/server.key 2048
```

Create a certificate signing request using the newly generated key:

```bash
sudo openssl req -new \
  -key /root/server.key -out /root/server.csr \
  -subj "/O=$ORGANIZATION_NAME/CN=$SERVER_FQDN/emailAddress=$ADMIN_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
```

Create the server certificate from the certificate request using the CA:

```bash
sudo openssl x509 -req \
  -in /root/server.csr -CA /root/ca.cert -CAkey /root/ca.key \
  -CAcreateserial -out /root/server.cert -days 999 -sha256
```

Now we repeat the process to generate the client key and certificate:

```bash
sudo openssl genrsa -out /root/client.key 2048
sudo openssl req -new \
  -key /root/client.key -out /root/client.csr \
  -subj "/O=$ORGANIZATION_NAME/CN=$CLIENT_CN/emailAddress=$ADMIN_EMAIL_ADDRESS"
sudo openssl x509 -req \
  -in /root/client.csr -CA /root/ca.cert -CAkey /root/ca.key \
  -CAcreateserial -out /root/client.cert -days 999 -sha256
```

!!! Note
    The certificates in this guide, including the self-signed CA, are all configured with a lifetime of 999 days.
    If necessary this can be changed by replacing the `-days 999` argument above.

Finally, move the CA certificate, the server key and server certificate to a location accessible by the Apache HTTP Server user and ensure correct permissions on the server key:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /usr/lib/pgbapi
sudo mv /root/ca.cert /root/server.key /root/server.cert /usr/lib/pgbapi
sudo chmod 600 /usr/lib/pgapi/server.key
```

Setting ownership differs by platform because each Linux distribution flavor runs Apache HTTP Server under a different account.

#### Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
sudo chown -R www-data /usr/lib/pgbapi
```

#### RHEL

```bash
sudo chown -R apache:apache /usr/lib/pgbapi
```

#### SLES

```bash
sudo chown -R wwwrun /usr/lib/pgbapi
```

### Adding a VirtualHost definition for Postgres backup API

Add a file called `pgbapi.conf` to the Apache HTTP configuration directory which defines the `VirtualHost` which will act as a proxy.
The exact location of the file for the target system is given in the following table:

| OS            | Apache HTTP configuration dir |
|---------------|-------------------------------|
| Debian/Ubuntu |  /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/  |
| RHEL          |  /etc/httpd/conf.d/           |
| SLES          |  /etc/apache2/conf.d/         |

The contents of `pgbapi.conf` should be as follows:

```text
<VirtualHost *:443>
    ServerName $SERVER_FQDN
    SSLEngine on

    SSLCertificateFile /usr/lib/pgbapi/server.cert
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /usr/lib/pgbapi/server.key
    SSLCACertificateFile /usr/lib/pgbapi/ca.cert

    SSLVerifyClient require
    SSLVerifyDepth 1

    ProxyPass "/" "http://localhost:7480/"
    ProxyPassReverse "/" "http://localhost:7480/"
</VirtualHost>
```
Note that the CA certificate, server certificate and server key are expected to be available in `/usr/lib/pgabi`.
If your key and certificates are located elsewhere then update the SSL certificate paths as required.
Be sure to change `$SERVER_FQDN` to its actual value.

Finally, reload the Apache HTTP Server config.

#### Debian/Ubuntu and SLES

```bash
sudo systemctl reload apache2
```

#### RHEL

```bash
sudo systemctl reload httpd
```

### Client configuration

Postgres backup API is now configured for secure remote access.

The CA certificate, client certificate and client key created earlier will all be required by the client application so that it can connect and authenticate.
The files `/root/ca.cert`, `/root/client.key` and `/root/client.cert` should therefore be copied securely to the client so that the client can be configured to use them.

As an example, curl can be configured to authenticate with a Postgres backup API instance running at `pgbapi.example.com` as follows:

```bash
curl --cacert /usr/lib/pgbapi/ca.cert \
     --cert /root/client.cert \
     --key /root/client.key \
     https://pgbapi.example.com/status
```
