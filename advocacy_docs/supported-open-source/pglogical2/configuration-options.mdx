Some aspects of PGLogical can be configured using configuration options that
can be either set in `postgresql.conf` or via `ALTER SYSTEM SET`.

-   `pglogical.conflict_resolution`
    Sets the resolution method for any detected conflicts between local data
    and incoming changes.

    Possible values:

    -   `error` - the replication will stop on error if conflict is detected and
        manual action is needed for resolving
    -   `apply_remote` - always apply the change that's conflicting with local
        data
    -   `keep_local` - keep the local version of the data and ignore the
         conflicting change that is coming from the remote node
    -   `last_update_wins` - the version of data with newest commit timestamp
         will be kept (this can be either local or remote version)
    -   `first_update_wins` - the version of the data with oldest timestamp will
         be kept (this can be either local or remote version)

    The available settings and defaults depend on version of PostgreSQL and
    other settings.

    The default value in PostgreSQL is `apply_remote`.

    The `keep_local`, `last_update_wins` and `first_update_wins` settings
    require `track_commit_timestamp` PostgreSQL setting to be enabled. As
    `track_commit_timestamp` is not available in PostgreSQL 9.4
    `pglogical.conflict_resolution` can only be `apply_remote` or `error`.

    In Postgres-XL, the only supported value and the default is `error`.

-   `pglogical.conflict_log_level`
    Sets the log level for reporting detected conflicts when the
    `pglogical.conflict_resolution` is set to anything else than `error`.

    Main use for this setting is to suppress logging of conflicts.

    Possible values are same as for `log_min_messages` PostgreSQL setting.

    The default is `LOG`.

-   `pglogical.batch_inserts`
    Tells PGLogical to use batch insert mechanism if possible. Batch mechanism
    uses PostgreSQL internal batch insert mode which is also used by `COPY`
    command.

    The batch inserts will improve replication performance of transactions that
    did many inserts into one table. PGLogical will switch to batch mode when
    transaction did more than 5 INSERTs.

    It's only possible to switch to batch mode when there are no
    `INSTEAD OF INSERT` and `BEFORE INSERT` triggers on the table and when
    there are no defaults with volatile expressions for columns of the table.
    Also the batch mode will only work when `pglogical.conflict_resolution` is
    set to `error`.

    The default is `true`.

-   `pglogical.use_spi`
      Tells PGLogical to use SPI interface to form actual SQL
      (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) statements to apply incoming changes instead
      of using internal low level interface.

      This is mainly useful for Postgres-XL and debugging purposes.

      The default in PostgreSQL is `false`.

      This can be set to `true` only when `pglogical.conflict_resolution` is set to `error`.
    In this state, conflicts are not detected.

      In Postgres-XL the default and only allowed setting is `true`.

-   `pglogical.temp_directory`
    Defines system path where to put temporary files needed for schema
    synchronization. This path need to exist and be writable by user running
    Postgres.

    Default is empty, which tells PGLogical to use default temporary directory
    based on environment and operating system settings.
