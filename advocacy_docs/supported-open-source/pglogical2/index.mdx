The pglogical 2 extension provides logical streaming replication for PostgreSQL,
using a publish/subscribe model. It is based on technology developed as part
of [EDB Postgres Distributed](/pgd/latest/).

!!! Note "pglogical 2 is open source"
    EDB maintains pglogical as a service to the PostgreSQL community.

We use the following terms to describe data streams between nodes, deliberately
reused from the earlier Slony technology:

-   Nodes - PostgreSQL database instances
-   Providers and Subscribers - roles taken by Nodes
-   Replication Set - a collection of tables

pglogical is utilising the latest in-core features, so we have these version restrictions:

-   Provider & subscriber nodes must run PostgreSQL 9.4+
-   PostgreSQL 9.5+ is required for replication origin filtering and conflict detection
-   Additionally, subscriber can be Postgres-XL 9.5+

Use cases supported are:

-   Upgrades between major versions (given the above restrictions)
-   Full database replication
-   Selective replication of sets of tables using replication sets
-   Selective replication of table rows at either publisher or subscriber side (row_filter)
-   Selective replication of table columns at publisher side
-   Data gather/merge from multiple upstream servers

Architectural details:

-   pglogical works on a per-database level, not whole server level like
    physical streaming replication
-   One Provider may feed multiple Subscribers without incurring additional disk
    write overhead
-   One Subscriber can merge changes from several origins and detect conflict
    between changes with automatic and configurable conflict resolution (some,
    but not all aspects required for multi-master).
-   Cascading replication is implemented in the form of changeset forwarding.
