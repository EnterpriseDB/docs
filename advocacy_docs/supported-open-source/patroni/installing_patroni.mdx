EDB provides Patroni to customers via the `edb-patroni` package. This package provides Patroni itself and all its dependencies, so there is no need to install additional packages on the Postgres nodes.

Extra packages which no longer have to be installed separately are the following:

- python3-cdiff
- python3-psutil
- python3-psycopg2
- python3-ydiff
- python3-click
- python3-six
- python3-dateutil
- python3-prettytable
- python3-pyyaml
- python3-urllib3
- python3-etcd
- python3-dns
- python3-certifi

Packages are available for all subscribed customers with a valid EDB account under any entitlement (Community360, Standard, and Enterprise).

!!! Note
    The `edb-patroni` does not provide packages for the etcd server needed for the DCS cluster

Once you have the EDB repository configured on all the nodes of the cluster, run the following commands depending on the Linux distribution you are using.

### Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y edb-patroni
```

!!! Note
    On Debian and Ubuntu installations, if you've previously installed the Patroni package named `patroni` using the EDB repositories, `apt upgrade` will not replace this package with the `edb-patroni` package. Executing `apt install edb-patroni` will install `edb-patroni` as a replacement of `patroni`.

See [Quick start on Debian 11](debian11_quick_start/#4-patroni) for a more detailed configuration example.

### RHEL/CentOS

```bash
sudo dnf install -y edb-patroni
```

See [Quick start on RHEL8](rhel8_quick_start/#4-patroni) for a more detailed configuration example.

### Installing community packages

We also support community packages provided through PGDG repositories. Follow the [PGDG deb download instructions](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/debian/) to set up the `apt` repository, or the [PGDG rpm download instructions](https://yum.postgresql.org/) for the `yum` repository. Keep in mind that for PGDG rpm repositories you will need to configure Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux ([EPEL](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL)).
