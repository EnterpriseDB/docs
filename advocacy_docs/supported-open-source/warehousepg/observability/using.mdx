In Grafana, a dashboard is the main canvas for data. Dashboards are composed by rows, which are logical dividers that group related visualizations, called panels. Panels are the individual charts or widgets displaying metrics.

The following is a description of the different dashboards provided for WHPG Observability.

### Recommendations Details

This row lists the top tables or queries that require immediate attention related to bloat, missing statistics, or inefficient indexing.

- **Top 20 Bloated Tables**: Tables with the highest ratio of dead rows to total rows. This indicates severe table bloat that requires vacuuming to reclaim space and improve performance.
- **Top 20 Tables With the Most Dead Rows**: Tables containing the highest raw count of dead rows. These dead rows accumulate from updates and deletes and contribute to table bloat.
- **Top 20 Tables Not Vacuumed**: Tables that have never been vacuumed or auto-vacuumed and still contain dead rows. These tables are at high risk of severe bloat and should be prioritized for manual `VACUUM` operations.

- **Top 20 Largest Tables by Disk Usage**: Tables consuming the most disk space in the database. This helps identify the biggest contributors to storage usage for capacity planning.
- **Tables Likely Needing Indexes**: Tables where sequential scans are performed more significantly than index scans. This suggests missing or inefficient indexes and points to opportunities for query performance improvement.
