### Key features

- **Complete Data Coverage**: Provides both host-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network) and SQL metrics (query execution, transaction counts, database size).

- **Leverages Existing Monitoring Stack**: Seamlessly integrates with industry-standard tools (Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana) for robust data storage, alerting, and visualization.

- **Cluster Health & Status**: Offers detailed insights into the state of your cluster, including segment status, configuration health, and coordinator/standby counts.

- **Performance Diagnostics**: Tracks long-running queries, queries causing excessive disk spill, and resource group status.

- **Proactive Maintenance**: Identifies tables needing maintenance, such as tables with missing statistics, high dead row counts, or significant data skew.

- **Log Integration**: Collects and streams log files from your WHPG cluster, making them accessible via the integrated monitoring system.

- **Flexible Data Visualization**: Includes pre-configured dashboards in Grafana for immediate insights, which are fully customizable to meet specific operational requirements.
