WarehousePG (WHPG) Observability serves as a centralized monitoring hub for your WHPG cluster, delivering host-level metrics, cluster health, data load, query performance insights, table maintenance recommendations, and integrated log file management by seamlessly integrating with existing tools like Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki for data retrieval and visualization. If you already have a monitoring stack using some or all of these components, then adding WarehousePG is as simple as installing a few packages and importing Grafana dashboards. Or if you want to get started quickly, we have recommended Docker Compose configuration and instructions for running everything you need.

### Key features

- **Complete data coverage**: Provides both host-level metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network) and SQL metrics (query execution, transaction counts, database size).

- **Leverages existing monitoring stack**: Seamlessly integrates with industry-standard tools (Prometheus, Loki, and Grafana) for robust data storage, alerting, and visualization.

- **Cluster health & status**: Offers detailed insights into the state of your cluster, including segment status, configuration health, and coordinator/standby counts.

- **Performance diagnostics**: Tracks long-running queries, queries causing excessive disk spill, and resource group status.

- **Proactive maintenance**: Identifies tables needing maintenance, such as tables with missing statistics, high dead row counts, or significant data skew.

- **Log integration**: Collects and streams log files from your WHPG cluster, making them accessible via the integrated monitoring system.

- **Flexible data visualization**: Includes pre-configured dashboards in Grafana for immediate insights, which are fully customizable to meet specific operational requirements.
