WarehousePG Observability provides a centralized monitoring hub for your WarehousePG cluster. It is designed to deliver immediate, actionable insights into cluster health, performance, and maintenance needs by leveraging industry-standard monitoring tools.

## What it delivers

- **Complete Visibility**: Collects and processes SQL metrics (query performance, table health), host metrics (CPU, memory, disk), and integrated log files from every node in the cluster.
- **Proactive Maintenance Insights**: Identifies critical maintenance tasks, such as tables with high bloat, missing statistics, or heavy disk spill activity.
- **Seamless Integration**: Designed for immediate deployment using your existing monitoring stack: Prometheus for historical data storage, Loki for log management, and Grafana for flexible, customized visualization.
