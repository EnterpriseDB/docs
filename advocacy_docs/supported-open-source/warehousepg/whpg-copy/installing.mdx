Install WarehousePG (WHPG) Copy.

## Prerequisites

- You must install the same version of `whpg-copy` on all hosts of both source and destination clusters.
- The host running `whpg-copy` must have network access to both the source and destination database coordinators.
- The destination cluster segments must be accessible from the source cluster segments on the ports specified by `--port-range`.
- The user specified in the connection strings must have sufficient privileges to read from the source and write to the destination (including creating schemas and tables).
- `whpg-copy` currently does not fully support password authentication. While passwords can be specified in the connection string, certain operations (like DDL dumping) may still fail. It is recommended to use a `.pgpass` file or trust-based authentication. Improved password support is planned for future releases.

## Downloading and installing the utility

You must install the utility on each host in your source and destination WareHousePG clusters.

1. Configure your package manager to use the EDB repository for WHPG:

    ```bash
    export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=<your-token>
    export EDB_REPO=gpsupp
    curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_REPO/setup.rpm.sh" | sudo -E bash
    ```

1. Create a file `all_hosts` on both source and destination WHPG coordinators, which lists all hosts in each WHPG cluster. For example:

    ```ini
    cdw
    scdw
    sdw1
    sdw2
    sdw3
    ```

1. From each coordinator, use the `gpssh` utility to install the packages from the coordinator onto every other host in the cluster:

    <TabContainer syncKey="install">
    <Tab title="RHEL 8, 9">

    ```bash 
    gpssh -f all_hosts -e 'sudo dnf install -y whpg-copy'
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="RHEL 7">

    ```bash 
    gpssh -f all_hosts -e 'sudo yum install -y whpg-copy'
    ```

    </Tab>
    </TabContainer>
