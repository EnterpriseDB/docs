Install WarehousePG (WHPG) Copy. You can install and run the utility on a separate host, as long as it has access to both the source and destination WHPG coordinators.

## Downloading and installing the utility

You must install the utility on each host in your source and destination WareHousePG clusters.

1. Configure your package manager to use the EDB repository for WHPG:

    ```bash
    export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=<your-token>
    export EDB_REPO=gpsupp
    curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_REPO/setup.rpm.sh" | sudo -E bash
    ```

1. Create a file `all_hosts` on both source and destination WHPG coordinators, which lists all hosts in each WHPG cluster. For example:

    ```ini
    cdw
    scdw
    sdw1
    sdw2
    sdw3
    ```

1. From each coordinator, use the `gpssh` utility to install the packages from the coordinator onto every other host in the cluster:

    <TabContainer syncKey="install">
    <Tab title="RHEL 8, 9">

    ```bash 
    gpssh -f all_hosts -e 'sudo dnf install -y whpg-copy'
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="RHEL 7">

    ```bash 
    gpssh -f all_hosts -e 'sudo yum install -y whpg-copy'
    ```

    </Tab>
    </TabContainer>
