You must install WarehousePG (WHPG) Copy on each host in your source and destination WarehousePG clusters. Optionally, you can also install and run the utility from a separate host, as long as it has access to both the source and destination WHPG coordinators.

## Downloading and installing the utility

1. On both source and destination coordinators, download the package from the EDB repository:

    <TabContainer syncKey="download">
    <Tab title="RHEL 8, 9">

    ```bash
    export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=<your-token>
    export EDB_REPO=gpsupp
    curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_REPO/setup.rpm.sh" | sudo -E bash
    sudo dnf download edb-whpg-copy
    ```
    
    </Tab>
    <Tab title="RHEL 7">

    ```bash
    export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=<your-token>
    export EDB_REPO=gpsupp
    curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_REPO/setup.rpm.sh" | sudo -E bash
    sudo yumdownloader edb-whpg-copy
    ```

    </Tab>
    </TabContainer>

1. On both source and destination coordinators, create a file `all_hosts` which lists all hosts in each WHPG cluster. For example:

    ```ini
    cdw
    scdw
    sdw1
    sdw2
    sdw3
    ```

1. From each coordinator, use the `gpsync` utility to transfer the package to all hosts in the cluster and then use use the `gpssh` utility to install the package:

    <TabContainer syncKey="install">
    <Tab title="RHEL 8, 9">

    ```bash 
    gpsync -f all_hosts <whpg-copy-package-name> =:/tmp
    gpssh -f all_hosts -e 'sudo dnf install -y /tmp/<whpg-copy-package-name>'
    ```
    
    Where `<whpg-copy-package-name>` is the name of the WarehousePG Copy package file you downloaded.

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="RHEL 7">

    ```bash 
    gpsync -f all_hosts <whpg-copy-package-name> =:/tmp
    gpssh -f all_hosts -e 'sudo yum install -y /tmp/<whpg-copy-package-name>'
    ```

    Where `<whpg-copy-package-name>` is the name of the WarehousePG Copy package file you downloaded.

    </Tab>
    </TabContainer>
