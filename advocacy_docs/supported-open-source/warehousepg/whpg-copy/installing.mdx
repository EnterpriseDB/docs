You must install WarehousePG (WHPG) Copy on each host in your source and destination WarehousePG clusters. Optionally, you can also install and run the utility from a separate host, as long as it has access to both the source and destination WHPG coordinators.

## Downloading and installing the utility

1. Configure your package manager to use the EDB repository for WHPG:

    ```bash
    export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=<your-token>
    export EDB_REPO=gpsupp
    curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_REPO/setup.rpm.sh" | sudo -E bash
    ```

1. On both source and destination coordinators, create a file `all_hosts` which lists all hosts in each WHPG cluster. For example:

    ```ini
    cdw
    scdw
    sdw1
    sdw2
    sdw3
    ```

1. From each coordinator, use the `gpssh` utility to install the packages from the coordinator onto every other host in the cluster:

    <TabContainer syncKey="install">
    <Tab title="RHEL 8, 9">

    ```bash 
    gpssh -f all_hosts -e 'sudo dnf install -y whpg-copy'
    ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab title="RHEL 7">

    ```bash 
    gpssh -f all_hosts -e 'sudo yum install -y whpg-copy'
    ```

    </Tab>
    </TabContainer>
