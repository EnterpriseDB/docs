WareHousePG Copy facilitates the migration of database objects and data from a source WarehousePG cluster to a destination cluster. It handles:

- **Schema Migration:** Automatically creates schemas and tables on the destination if they don't exist.
- **Data Transfer:** Moves data efficiently using parallel workers and optional compression.
- **Dependency Resolution:** Analyzes table dependencies (like foreign keys) to ensure data is copied in the correct order.

It is designed to be robust, providing detailed reports on success and failure, and generating retry configurations for failed tasks.
