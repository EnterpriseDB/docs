These are the currently known issues and limitations identified in the WarehousePG Copy release. Where applicable, we have included workarounds to help you mitigate the impact of these issues. These issues are actively tracked and are planned for resolution in a future release.

- **Support for password authentication**: `whpg-copy` currently does not currently provide full support for password authentication. To ensure stability, we recommend to use a `.pgpass` file or configure trust-based authentication (via `pg_hba.conf`) for the duration of the copy. Comprehensive password support is currently under development for a future release.
- **Views and materialized views:** `whpg-copy` supports the creation of both regular views and materialized views on the destination cluster. However, it does not perform a refresh of materialized views after the copy operation. You must manually execute `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` on the destination if you need the data to be up-to-date.
