These are the currently known issues and limitations identified in the WarehousePG Copy release. Where applicable, we have included workarounds to help you mitigate the impact of these issues. These issues are actively tracked and are planned for resolution in a future release.

- `whpg-copy` currently does not fully support password authentication. While passwords can be specified in the connection string, certain operations (like DDL dumping) may still fail. It is recommended to use a `.pgpass` file or trust-based authentication. Improved password support is planned for future releases.
- **Views and Materialized Views:** `whpg-copy` supports the creation of both regular views and materialized views on the destination cluster. However, it does not perform a refresh of materialized views after the copy operation. You must manually execute `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` on the destination if you need the data to be up-to-date.
