WarehousePG (WHPG) Copy, or `wgph-copy` is a high-performance utility designed for migrating data between a source and a destination WarehousePG (WHPG) cluster. By transferring data directly between segment hosts, it bypasses the coordinator bottleneck to achieve massive throughput.

WareHousePG Copy is versioned independently of WareHousePG. Refer to [Supported platforms]](/warehousepg/whpg-copy/overview/supported_platforms) for compatibility information.
