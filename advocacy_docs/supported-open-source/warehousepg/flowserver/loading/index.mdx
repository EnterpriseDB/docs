FlowServer for WareHousePG (WHPG) supports loading data from Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ sources into a WHPG table.

Apache Kafka is a fault-tolerant, low-latency, distributed publish-subscribe message system. FlowServer for WHPG supports loading Kafka data from the Apache and Confluent Kafka distributions.

The FlowServer supports loading data from a RabbitMQ traditional AMQP queue into WHPG. FlowServer acts as a RabbitMQ consumer.

Perform the following tasks when you use the FlowServer to load data into a WHPG table:

1. Ensure that you meet the [prerequisites](prerequisites).
1. [Construct the load configuration file](config_file).
1. [Create the target table on WHPG](target_table) and assign the necessary role permissions.
1. Run the FlowCLI client to [submit and manage the load job](submit_job).
