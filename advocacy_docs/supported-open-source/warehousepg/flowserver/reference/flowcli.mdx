Manage the WarehousePG FlowServer jobs. It allows users to submit, start, stop, and monitor jobs.

## Synopsis

```
flowcli <subcommand> [global options]
```

## Subcommands

### Submit

Submit a job by providing a YAML configuration file or a directory. If a directory is provided, all YAML files in that directory will be submitted as separate jobs.

Command usage

```
flowcli submit <jobconfig.yaml | /directory/path> [options]
```

The subcommand `submit` supports the following options:
- `-n | --name <job_name>`: (Optional) Specify a name for the job. If not provided, the job name will be derived from the configuration file name.
- `-s | --start`: (Optional) Immediately start the job after submission. If specified, you also can add the options for the `start` subcommand.

Example:

```bash
flocli submit -n kafka_job kafka.yaml
```

### Start

Start a job or multiple jobs.

Command usage

```
flowcli start <job_name> [options]
```

The subcommand `start` supports the following options:
- `--all`: Start all jobs that are not in running state.
- `--stop-at-eof`: Stop the job when the end of the input data is reached. This is applicable for jobs that read from a source like Kafka or RabbitMQ.
- `--reset-to-earliest`: Reset to the earliest offset in the source on job starting. This is applicable for jobs that read from Kafka.
- `--reset-to-latest`: Reset to the latest offset in the source on job starting. This is applicable for jobs that read from Kafka.
- `--reset-to-timestamp <timestamp>`: Reset to the specified timestamp in the source on job starting. This is applicable for jobs that read from Kafka.
- `--skip-explain`: Skip the SQL explain phase of the job on starting. This is helpful for reducing the startup time of the job.

```

The subcommand `stop` supports the following options:
- `--all`: Stop all running jobs
