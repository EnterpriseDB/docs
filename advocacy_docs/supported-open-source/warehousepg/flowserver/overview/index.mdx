FlowServer for WarehousePG (WHPG) provides a dedicated framework for your data ingestion pipelines. It is designed to deliver real-time visibility into the health and performance of ETL jobs, ensuring that data moving from streaming sources like Kafka and RabbitMQ reaches your WarehousePG cluster efficiently.

## What it delivers

What it delivers

- **High-performance parallel loading**: Writes data delivered from clients directly into the segments of the WHPG cluster, bypassing coordinator bottlenecks for maximum throughput.

- **Broad data source support**: Seamlessly integrates with modern message brokers, supporting Kafka and RabbitMQ queues.

- **Versatile format handling**: Supports standard data formats including JSON, CSV, and Avro (Kafka only).

- **Optimized command-line interface**: Features a streamlined CLI that allows you to submit, start, list, and monitor jobs.

- **Real-time job monitoring**: Provides detailed visibility into active tasks, showing loading ratios, total row counts, and progress tracking.

- **Native observability**: Includes built-in Prometheus metrics to monitor system health and performance out of the box.

- **Advanced stream control**: Allows for precise data recovery and synchronization with flags to reset stream offsets to the earliest, latest, or specific timestamps.
