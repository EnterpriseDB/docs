These are the currently known issues and limitations identified in the FlowServer for WarehousePG release. Where applicable, we have included workarounds to help you mitigate the impact of these issues. These issues are actively tracked and are planned for resolution in a future release.

Unsupported configurations:

- save_failing_batch &  recover_failing_batch
Only available for Kafka source in GPSS,  so we don’t have to configure them for RabbitMQ.


- max_retries: & retry_interval
They are used for retrying failed job. But actually, it can’t recover the failed job. So it is better to check the failed job and recover it manually.
