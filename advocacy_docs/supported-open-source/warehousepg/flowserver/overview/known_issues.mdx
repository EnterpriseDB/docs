These are the currently known issues and limitations identified in the FlowServer for WarehousePG release. Where applicable, we have included workarounds to help you mitigate the impact of these issues. These issues are actively tracked and are planned for resolution in a future release.

- The `save_failing_batch` and `recover_failing_batch` configuration parameters are currently unsupported.

- The `max_retries` and `retry_interval` parameters do not currently facilitate successful recovery of failed load jobs. In the event of a job failure, we recommend you inspect the error logs and perform a manual recovery rather than relying on automated retries.
