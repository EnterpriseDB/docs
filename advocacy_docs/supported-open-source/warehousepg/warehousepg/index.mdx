## Introducing WarehousePG

[WarehousePG](https://warehouse-pg.io/) is a new Apache 2-licensed fork of the formerly open source Greenplum Database. It offers binary compatibility with the legacy Greenplum versions most widely deployed by customers (6.x and 7.x) — plus net-new functionality and integrations.

### Key features

* Petabytes scale with high-speed /-concurrency performance, via MPP Cluster topology with a Postgres fork based on PG 12.12.
* A Master (coordinator) for query optimization and parallel plan and distribution
* Multiple segments (workers) for parallel execution of queries with each segment being a Postgres instance.
* High availability with standbys for the Master and mirrors for the segments.
* High-speed interconnections for continuous data processing pipelining.

### Support

For business-critical workloads, EDB Postgres AI provides support for WarehousePG. See the [EDB Postgres AI support for Greenplum workloads](../edbpggpsupp/) page for more information.
