<a id="section2"></a>

## Synopsis

```{#sql_command_synopsis}
DROP CONVERSION [IF EXISTS] <name> [CASCADE | RESTRICT]
```

<a id="section3"></a>

## Description

`DROP CONVERSION` removes a previously defined conversion. To be able to drop a conversion, you must own the conversion.

<a id="section4"></a>

## Parameters

IF EXISTS
Do not throw an error if the conversion does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

name
The name of the conversion. The conversion name may be schema-qualified.

CASCADE
RESTRICT
These keywords have no effect since there are no dependencies on conversions.

<a id="section5"></a>

## Examples

Drop the conversion named `myname`:

```
DROP CONVERSION myname;
```

<a id="section6"></a>

## Compatibility

There is no `DROP CONVERSION` statement in the SQL standard. The standard has `CREATE TRANSLATION` and `DROP TRANSLATION` statements that are similar to the WarehousePG `CREATE CONVERSION` and `DROP CONVERSION` statements.
