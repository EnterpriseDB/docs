Commits the current transaction.

<a id="section2"></a>

## Synopsis

```{#sql_command_synopsis}
END [WORK | TRANSACTION] [AND [NO] CHAIN]
```

<a id="section3"></a>

## Description

`END` commits the current transaction. All changes made by the transaction become visible to others and are guaranteed to be durable if a crash occurs. This command is a WarehousePG extension that is equivalent to [COMMIT](COMMIT.mdx).

<a id="section4"></a>

## Parameters

WORK
TRANSACTION
Optional keywords. They have no effect.

AND CHAIN
If `AND CHAIN` is specified, a new transaction is immediately started with the same transaction characteristics (see [SET TRANSACTION](SET_TRANSACTION.mdx)) as the just finished one. Otherwise, no new transaction is started.

<a id="section4a"></a>

## Notes

Use [ROLLBACK](ROLLBACK.mdx) to terminate a transaction.

Issuing `END` when not inside a transaction does no harm, but it will provoke a warning message.

<a id="section5"></a>

## Examples

To commit the current transaction and make all changes permanent:

```
END;
```

<a id="section6"></a>

## Compatibility

`END` is a WarehousePG extension that provides functionality equivalent to [COMMIT](COMMIT.mdx), which is specified in the SQL standard.
