<a id="section2"></a>

## Synopsis

```{#sql_command_synopsis}
DROP FOREIGN TABLE [ IF EXISTS ] <name> [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

<a id="section3"></a>

## Description

`DROP FOREIGN TABLE` removes an existing foreign table. Only the owner of a foreign table can remove it.

<a id="section4"></a>

## Parameters

IF EXISTS
Do not throw an error if the foreign table does not exist. WarehousePG issues a notice in this case.

name
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the foreign table to drop.

CASCADE
Automatically drop objects that depend on the foreign table (such as views), and in turn all objects that depend on those objects.

RESTRICT
Refuse to drop the foreign table if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

## Examples

To destroy two foreign tables, `films` and `distributors`:

```
DROP FOREIGN TABLE films, distributors;
```

<a id="section7"></a>

## Compatibility

`DROP FOREIGN TABLE` conforms to ISO/IEC 9075-9 (SQL/MED), except that the standard only allows one foreign table to be dropped per command. The `IF EXISTS` clause is a WarehousePG extension.
