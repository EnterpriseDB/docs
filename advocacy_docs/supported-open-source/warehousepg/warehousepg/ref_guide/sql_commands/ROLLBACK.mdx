Stops the current transaction.

## Synopsis

```{#sql_command_synopsis}
ROLLBACK [WORK | TRANSACTION] [AND [NO] CHAIN]
```

<a id="section3"></a>

## Description

`ROLLBACK` rolls back the current transaction and causes all the updates made by the transaction to be discarded.

<a id="section4"></a>

## Parameters

WORK
TRANSACTION
Optional key words. They have no effect.

AND CHAIN
If `AND CHAIN` is specified, a new transaction is immediately started with the same transaction characteristics (see [SET TRANSACTION](SET_TRANSACTION.mdx)) as the just finished one. Otherwise, no new transaction is started.

<a id="section5"></a>

## Notes

Use [COMMIT](COMMIT.mdx) to successfully end the current transaction.

Issuing `ROLLBACK` when not inside a transaction block emits a warning and otherwise has no effect. `ROLLBACK AND CHAIN` outside of a transaction block is an error.

## Examples

To discard all changes made in the current transaction:

```
ROLLBACK;
```

<a id="section7"></a>

## Compatibility

The command `ROLLBACK` conforms to the SQL standard. The form `ROLLBACK TRANSACTION` is a WarehousePG extension.
