    {<right_type> | NONE} ) [, ...] [CASCADE | RESTRICT]
```

<a id="section3"></a>

## Description

## Parameters

IF EXISTS
Do not throw an error if the operator does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

name
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing operator.

left_type
The data type of the operator's left operand; write `NONE` if the operator has no left operand.

right_type
The data type of the operator's right operand; write `NONE` if the operator has no right operand.

CASCADE
Automatically drop objects that depend on the operator (such as views using it), and in turn all objects that depend on those objects.

RESTRICT
Refuse to drop the operator if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

## Examples

Remove the power operator `a^b` for type `integer`:

```
DROP OPERATOR ^ (integer, integer);
```

Remove the left unary bitwise complement operator `~b` for type `bit`:

```
DROP OPERATOR ~ (none, bit);
```

Remove the right unary factorial operator `x!` for type `bigint`:

```
DROP OPERATOR ! (bigint, none);
```

Remove multiple operators in one command:

```
DROP OPERATOR ~ (none, bit), ! (bigint, none);
```
