## Synopsis

```{#sql_command_synopsis}
ALTER SCHEMA <name> RENAME TO <new_name>

ALTER SCHEMA <name> OWNER TO { <new_owner> | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER }
```

<a id="section3"></a>

## Description

`ALTER SCHEMA` changes the definition of a schema.

You must own the schema to use `ALTER SCHEMA`. To rename a schema you must also have the `CREATE` privilege for the database. To alter the owner, you must also be a direct or indirect member of the new owning role, and you must have the `CREATE` privilege for the database. Note that superusers have all these privileges automatically.

<a id="section4"></a>

## Parameters

name
The name of an existing schema.

new_name
The new name of the schema. The new name cannot begin with `pg_`, as such names are reserved for system schemas.

new_owner
The new owner of the schema.

<a id="section5"></a>

## Compatibility

There is no `ALTER SCHEMA` statement in the SQL standard.

<a id="section6"></a>
