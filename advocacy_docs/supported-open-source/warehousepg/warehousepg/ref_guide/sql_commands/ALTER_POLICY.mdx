Changes the definition of a row-level security policy.

<a id="section2"></a>

## Synopsis

```{#sql_command_synopsis}
ALTER POLICY <name> ON <table_name> RENAME TO <new_name>

ALTER POLICY <name ON table_name>
    [ TO { <role_name> | PUBLIC | CURRENT_USER | SESSION_USER } [, ...] ]
    [ USING ( <using_expression> ) ]
    [ WITH CHECK ( <check_expression> ) ]
```

<a id="section3"></a>

## Description

`ALTER POLICY` changes the definition of an existing row-level security policy. Note that `ALTER POLICY` only allows the set of roles to which the policy applies and the `USING` and `WITH CHECK` expressions to be modified. To change other properties of a policy, such as the command to which it applies or whether it is permissive or restrictive, the policy must be dropped and recreated.

To use `ALTER POLICY`, you must own the table to which the policy applies.

In the second form of `ALTER POLICY`, the role list, using_expression, and check_expression are replaced independently if specified. When one of those clauses is omitted, the corresponding part of the policy is unchanged.

<a id="section4"></a>

## Parameters

name
The name of an existing policy to alter.

table_name
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table that the policy is on.

new_name
The new name for the policy.

role_name
The role(s) to which the policy applies. Multiple roles can be specified at one time. To apply the policy to all roles, use `PUBLIC`.

using_expression
The `USING` expression for the policy. See [CREATE POLICY](CREATE_POLICY.mdx) for details.

check_expression
The `WITH CHECK` expression for the policy. See [CREATE POLICY](CREATE_POLICY.mdx) for details.
