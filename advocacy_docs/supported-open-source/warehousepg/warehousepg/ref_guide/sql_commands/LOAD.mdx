Loads or reloads a shared library file.

<a id="section2"></a>

## Synopsis

```{#sql_command_synopsis}
LOAD '<filename>'
```

<a id="section3"></a>

## Description

This command loads a shared library file into the WarehousePG server address space. If the file had been loaded previously, it is first unloaded. This command is primarily useful to unload and reload a shared library file that has been changed since the server first loaded it. To make use of the shared library, function(s) in it need to be declared using the `CREATE FUNCTION` command.

The library file name is typically given as just a bare file name, which is sought in the server's library search path (set by `dynamic_library_path`). Alternatively it can be given as a full path name. In either case the platform's standard shared library file name extension may be omitted.

Note that in WarehousePG the shared library file (`.so` file) must reside in the same path location on every host in the WarehousePG cluster (coordinators, segments, and mirrors).

Non-superusers can only apply `LOAD` to library files located in `$libdir/plugins/` — the specified `filename` must begin with exactly that string. You must ensure that only “safe” libraries are installed there.
