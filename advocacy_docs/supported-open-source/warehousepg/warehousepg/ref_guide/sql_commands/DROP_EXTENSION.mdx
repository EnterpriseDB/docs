Removes an extension from a WarehousePG.

## Synopsis

```{#sql_command_synopsis}
DROP EXTENSION [ IF EXISTS ] <name> [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

<a id="section3"></a>

## Description

`DROP EXTENSION` removes extensions from the database. Dropping an extension causes its component objects to be dropped as well.

> **Note** The supporting extension files that were installed to create the extension (for example, the library and `.control` files) are not deleted. The files must be manually removed from the WarehousePG hosts.

You must own the extension to use `DROP EXTENSION`.

## Parameters

IF EXISTS
Do not throw an error if the extension does not exist. WarehousePG issues a notice in this case.

name
The name of an installed extension.

CASCADE
Automatically drop objects that depend on the extension, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects. Refer to the PostgreSQL [Dependency Tracking](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/ddl-depend.html) documentation for more information.

> **Important** Before issuing a `DROP EXTENSION` with the `CASCADE` keyword, you should be aware of all object that depend on the extension to avoid unintended consequences.

RESTRICT
Refuse to drop an extension if any objects depend on it (other than its own member objects and other extensions listed in the same `DROP` command). This is the default.

## Examples

To remove the extension `hstore` from the current database:

```
DROP EXTENSION hstore;
```

This command fails if any of the extension objects are in use in the database. For example, if a table is defined with columns of the `hstore` type. Add the `CASCADE` option to forcibly remove those dependent objects.
