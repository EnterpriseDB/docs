## Synopsis

```{#sql_command_synopsis}
DROP STATISTICS [ IF EXISTS ] <name> [, ...] [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

<a id="section3"></a>

## Description

`DROP STATISTICS` removes statistics object(s) from the database. Only the statistics object's owner, the schema owner, or a superuser can drop a statistics object.

<a id="section4"></a>

## Parameters

`IF EXISTS`
Do not throw an error if the statistics object does not exist. WarehousePG issues a notice in this case.

name
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the statistics object to drop.

CASCADE
RESTRICT
These key words have no effect, since there are no dependencies on statistics.

<a id="section6"></a>

## Examples

Destroy two statistics objects in different schemas, without failing if they do not exist:

```
DROP STATISTICS IF EXISTS
    accounting.users_uid_creation,
    public.grants_user_role;
```

<a id="section7"></a>

## Compatibility

There is no `DROP STATISTICS` command in the SQL standard.
