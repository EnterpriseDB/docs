Removes a data type.

<a id="section2"></a>

## Synopsis

```{#sql_command_synopsis}
DROP TYPE [IF EXISTS] <name> [, ...] [CASCADE | RESTRICT]
```

<a id="section3"></a>

## Description

`DROP TYPE` will remove a user-defined data type. Only the owner of a type can remove it.

<a id="section4"></a>

## Parameters

IF EXISTS
Do not throw an error if the type does not exist. WarehousePG issues a notice in this case.

name
The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the data type to remove.

CASCADE
Automatically drop objects that depend on the type (such as table columns, functions, operators), and in turn all objects that depend on those objects.

RESTRICT
Refuse to drop the type if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

<a id="section5"></a>

## Examples

Remove the data type `box`;

```
DROP TYPE box;
```

<a id="section6"></a>

## Compatibility

This command is similar to the corresponding command in the SQL standard, apart from the `IF EXISTS` option, which is a WarehousePG extension. But note that much of the `CREATE TYPE` command and the data type extension mechanisms in WarehousePG differ from the SQL standard.
