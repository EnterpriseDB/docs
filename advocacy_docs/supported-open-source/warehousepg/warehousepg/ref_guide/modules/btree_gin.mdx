The `btree_gin` module provides sample generalized inverted index (GIN) operator classes that implement B-tree equivalent behavior for certain data types.

The WarehousePG `btree_gin` module is equivalent to the PostgreSQL `btree_gin` module. There are no WarehousePG or MPP-specific considerations for the module.

## Installing and Registering the Module

The `btree_gin` module is installed when you install WarehousePG. Before you can use any of the functions defined in the module, you must register the `btree_gin` extension in each database in which you want to use the functions:

```
CREATE EXTENSION btree_gin;
```

Refer to [Installing Extensions](../../install_guide/install_extensions.mdx) for more information.
