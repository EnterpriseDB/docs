The PostgreSQL Audit Extension, or `pgaudit`, provides detailed session and object audit logging via the standard logging facility provided by PostgreSQL. The goal of PostgreSQL Audit is to provide the tools needed to produce audit logs required to pass certain government, financial, or ISO certification audits.

## Installing and Registering the Module

The `pgaudit` module is installed when you install WarehousePG. To use it, enable the extension as a preloaded library and restart WarehousePG.

First, check if there are any preloaded shared libraries by running the following command:

```
gpconfig -s shared_preload_libraries
```

Use the output of the above command to enable the `pgaudit` module, along any other shared libraries, and restart WarehousePG:

```
gpconfig -c shared_preload_libraries -v '<other_libraries>,pgaudit'
gpstop -ar 
```
