The `isn` module provides support for the international product numbering standards EAN13, UPC, ISBN (books), ISMN (music), and ISSN (serials). 

The WarehousePG `isn` module is equivalent to version 1.2 of the `isn` module used with PostgreSQL. There are no WarehousePG or MPP-specific considerations for the module.

## Installing and Registering the Module

The `isn` module is installed when you install WarehousePG. Before you can use any of the numbering standards defined in the module, you must register the `isn` extension in each database in which you want to use the standards:

```
CREATE EXTENSION isn;
```

Refer to [Installing Extensions](../../install_guide/install_extensions.mdx) for more information.
