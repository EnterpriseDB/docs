The `ip4r` module provides IPv4 and IPv6 data types, IPv4 and IPv6 range index data types, and related functions and operators.

The WarehousePG `ip4r` module is equivalent to version 2.4.2 of the `ip4r` module used with PostgreSQL. There are no WarehousePG or MPP-specific considerations for the module.

## Installing and Registering the Module

The `ip4r` module is installed when you install WarehousePG. Before you can use any of the data types defined in the module, you must register the `ip4r` extension in each database in which you want to use the types:

```
CREATE EXTENSION ip4r;
```

Refer to [Installing Extensions](../../install_guide/install_extensions.mdx) for more information.
