The `hstore` module implements a data type for storing sets of (key,value) pairs within a single WarehousePG data field. This can be useful in various scenarios, such as rows with many attributes that are rarely examined, or semi-structured data.

The WarehousePG `hstore` module is equivalent to the PostgreSQL `hstore` module. There are no WarehousePG or MPP-specific considerations for the module.

## Installing and Registering the Module

The `hstore` module is installed when you install WarehousePG. Before you can use any of the data types or functions defined in the module, you must register the `hstore` extension in each database in which you want to use the objects. Refer to [Installing Extensions](../../install_guide/install_extensions.mdx) for more information.
