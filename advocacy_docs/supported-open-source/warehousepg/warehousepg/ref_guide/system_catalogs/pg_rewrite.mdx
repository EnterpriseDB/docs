The `pg_rewrite` system catalog table stores rewrite rules for tables and views. `pg_class.relhasrules` must be true if a table has any rules in this catalog.

| column       | type         | references   | description                                                                                            |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `oid`        | oid          |              | The object ID                                                                                          |
| `rulename`   | name         |              | Rule name                                                                                              |
| `ev_class`   | oid          | pg_class.oid | The table this rule is for                                                                             |
| `ev_type`    | char         |              | Event type that the rule is for: 1 = SELECT, 2 = UPDATE, 3 = INSERT, 4 = DELETE                        |
| `ev_enabled` | char         |              | Controls in which session replication role mode the rule fires. Always O, rule fires in origin mode.   |
| `is_instead` | boolean      |              | True if the rule is an `INSTEAD` rule                                                                  |
| `ev_qual`    | pg_node_tree |              | Expression tree (in the form of a `nodeToString()` representation) for the rule's qualifying condition |
| `ev_action`  | pg_node_tree |              | Query tree (in the form of a `nodeToString()` representation) for the rule's action                    |
