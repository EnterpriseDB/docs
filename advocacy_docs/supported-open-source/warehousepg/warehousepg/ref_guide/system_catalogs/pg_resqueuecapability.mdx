> **Note** The `pg_resqueuecapability` system catalog table is valid only when resource queue-based resource management is active.

The `pg_resqueuecapability` system catalog table contains information about the extended attributes, or capabilities, of existing WarehousePG resource queues. Only resource queues that have been assigned an extended capability, such as a priority setting, are recorded in this table. This table is joined to the [pg_resqueue](pg_resqueue.mdx) table by resource queue object ID, and to the [pg_resourcetype](pg_resourcetype.mdx) table by resource type ID (`restypid`).

This table is populated only on the coordinator. This table is defined in the `pg_global` tablespace, meaning it is globally shared across all databases in the system.

| `rsqueueid` | oid      | `pg_resqueue.oid`           | The object ID of the associated resource queue.                                                                                                       |
| `restypid`  | smallint | `pg_resourcetype. restypid` | The resource type, derived from the *[pg_resqueuecapability](pg_resourcetype.mdx)* system table.                                                      |
| `resetting` | text     |                             | The specific value set for the capability referenced in this record. Depending on the actual resource type, this value may have different data types. |
