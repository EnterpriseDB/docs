The system catalog table `pg_sequence` contains information about sequences. Some information about sequences, such as the name and the schema, is stored in the [pg_class](pg_class.mdx) system table.

| `seqrelid`     | oid     | `pg_class.oid`  | OID of the `pg_class` entry for this sequence |
| `seqtypid`     | oid     | `pg_type.oid`   | Data type of the sequence                     |
| `seqstart`     | bigint  |                 | Start value of the sequence                   |
| `seqincrement` | bigint  |                 | Increment value of the sequence               |
| `seqmax`       | bigint  |                 | Maximum value of the sequence                 |
| `seqmin`       | bigint  |                 | Minimum value of the sequence                 |
| `seqcache`     | bigint  |                 | Cache size of the sequence                    |
