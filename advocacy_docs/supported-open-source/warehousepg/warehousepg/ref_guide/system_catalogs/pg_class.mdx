The system catalog table `pg_class` catalogs tables and most everything else that has columns or is otherwise similar to a table. This includes indexes (see also [pg_index](./)), sequences, views, materialized views, composite types, and TOAST tables. Below, when we mean all of these kinds of objects we speak of "relations". Not all columns are meaningful for all relation types.

Several of the Boolean flags in `pg_class` are maintained lazily: they are guaranteed to be true if that's the correct state, but may not be reset to false immediately when the condition is no longer true. For example, `relhasindex` is set by `CREATE INDEX`, but it is never cleared by `DROP INDEX`. Instead, `VACUUM` clears `relhasindex` if it finds the table has no indexes. This arrangement avoids race conditions and improves concurrency.
