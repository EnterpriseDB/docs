The `pg_statistic_ext_data` system catalog table holds data for extended planner statistics defined in [pg_statistic_ext](pg_statistic_ext.mdx). Each row in this catalog corresponds to a *statistics object* created with [CREATE STATISTICS](../sql_commands/CREATE_STATISTICS.mdx).

Like `pg_statistic`, `pg_statistic_ext_data` should not be readable by the public, since the contents might be considered sensitive. (Example: most common combinations of values in columns might be quite interesting.) [pg_stats_ext](catalog_ref-views.mdx#pg_stats_ext) is a publicly readable view on `pg_statistic_ext_data` (after joining with `pg_statistic_ext`) that only exposes information about those tables and columns that are readable by the current user.

| `stxddependencies` | pg_dependencies |                                               | Functional dependency statistics, serialized as `pg_dependencies` type.     |
| `stxdmcv`          | pg_mcv_list     |                                               | MCV (most-common values) list statistics, serialized as `pg_mcv_list` type. |
