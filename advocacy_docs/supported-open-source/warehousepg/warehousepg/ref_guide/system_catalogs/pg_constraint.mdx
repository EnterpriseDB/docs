The `pg_constraint` system catalog table stores check, primary key, unique, foreign key, and exclusion constraints on tables. (Column constraints are not treated specially. Every column constraint is equivalent to some table constraint.) Not-null constraints are represented in the [pg_attribute](pg_attribute.mdx) catalog table. Check constraints on domains are stored here, too.
