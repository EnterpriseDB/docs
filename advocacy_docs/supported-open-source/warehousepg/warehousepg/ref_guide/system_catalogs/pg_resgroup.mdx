> **Note** The `pg_resgroup` system catalog table is valid only when resource group-based resource management is active.

The `pg_resgroup` system catalog table contains information about WarehousePG resource groups, which are used for managing concurrent statements, CPU, and memory resources. This table, defined in the `pg_global` tablespace, is globally shared across all databases in the system.

| `rsgname` | name |            | The name of the resource group.  |
