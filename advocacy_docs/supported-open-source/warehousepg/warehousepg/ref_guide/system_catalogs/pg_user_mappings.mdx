The `pg_user_mappings` view provides access to information about user mappings. This view is essentially a public-readble view of the `pg_user_mapping` system catalog table that omits the options field if the user does not have access rights to view it.

| column      | type    | references                | description                                                          |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `umid`      | oid     | pg_user_mapping.oid       | OID of the user mapping.                                             |
| `srvid`     | oid     | pg_foreign_server.oid     | OID of the foreign server that contains this mapping.                |
| `srvname`   | text    | pg_foreign_server.srvname | Name of the foreign server.                                          |
| `umuser`    | oid     | pg_authid.oid             | OID of the local role being mapped, 0 if the user mapping is public. |
| `usename`   | name    |                           | Name of the local user to be mapped.                                 |
| `umoptions` | text\[] |                           | User mapping-specific options, as "keyword=value" strings.           |

To protect password information stored as a user mapping option, the `umoptions` column reads as null unless one of the following applies:

-   The current user is the user being mapped, and owns the server or holds `USAGE` privilege on it.
-   The current user is the server owner and the mapping is for `PUBLIC`.
-   The current user is a superuser.
