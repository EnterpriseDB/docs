The system catalog table `pg_foreign_table` contains auxiliary information about foreign tables. A foreign table is primarily represented by a `pg_class` entry, just like a regular table. Its `pg_foreign_table` entry contains the information that is pertinent only to foreign tables and not any other kind of relation.

| column      | type    | references            | description                                         |
| ----------- | ------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| `ftrelid`   | oid     | pg_class.oid          | OID of the `pg_class` entry for this foreign table. |
| `ftserver`  | oid     | pg_foreign_server.oid | OID of the foreign server for this foreign table.   |
| `ftoptions` | text\[] |                       | Foreign table options, as "keyword=value" strings.  |
