## WarehousePG 7.3.1-WHPG

Released: 30 January 2026

WarehousePG 7.3.1-WHPG includes the following new features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes:

### Enhancements

-   Allowed parallel workers to retrieve combo command ids and distributed snapshots directly from Dynamic Shared Memory (DSM).
-   Implemented pipes instead of sockets to terminate `poll()` blocking immediately for faster process signaling.
-   Added native support for executing `customscans` within the engine.
-   Made the `rescanforeignscan` callback optional for foreign data wrappers to improve FDW compatibility.
-   Configured GDD to push transaction ids into waitgxids so the query dispatcher can wait on them effectively.
-   Appended the WarehousePG name to the end of the version string for better identification.
-   Replaced `spinlocks` with `lwlocks` at the instrumentation header to reduce CPU contention.
-   Implemented pipes instead of sockets to terminate `poll()` blocking immediately for faster process signaling.
-   Updated the build instructions for RHEL8 and RHEL9 systems.
-   Updated regression test outputs to reflect recent FDW rescan changes.

### Bug fixes

-   Fixed a critical issue with shared snapshots in DSM to prevent potential data loss.
-   Resolved a crash in ORCA when processing percentile aggregates.
-   Fixed a crash and incorrect results when using distinct qualified aggregates (DQA) with a filter clause.
-   Initialized missing `plannedstmt` fields in ORCA to prevent execution errors. 
-   Corrected the handling of required but unused columns during DXL translation.
-   Fixed an incorrect join type assignment when pulling up expression sub-links.
-   Adjusted the severity level to warning in `ftsprobe.c` under specific conditions to reduce log noise.
-   Removed the `guc_no_show_all` flag for the `archive_timeout` setting. 
-   Fixed an invalid escape sequence in the `recoveryinfo.py` script.
-   Resolved an intermittent failure case in the `pg_waldump` tests.
-   Corrected the return type of `gddctxgetmaxvid()` to use `DistributedTransactionId(uint64)`.
-   Removed the deprecated `pkg_resources` dependency from the Python environment.

## WarehousePG 7.3.0-WHPG

Released: 14 November 2025

WarehousePG 7.3.0-WHPG includes the following new features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes:

### Enhancements

-   Enabled parallel workers context for index builds to improve creation speed. 
-   Merged Postgres 12 `llvm` changes and implemented explicit `llvmcontextref` for JIT inlining. 
-   Configured the system to insert WAL records uncompressed if compression fails, ensuring write continuity.
-   Updated the copy utility to print the specific `errno` for program pipes. 
-   Prevented the sorting of in-memory tuples when a process has already been interrupted.
-   Enabled builds for the `intarray` and `unaccent` extensions. 
-   Updated `waitgxids` to use `int64` for better handling of transaction ids. 
-   Added support for PL/Python2 testing.
-   Improved the reliability of error detection in status_check cases. 
-   Updated the PR template and `.editorconfig` settings. 

### Bug fixes

-   **High availability:** Fixed mirror promotion failures related to WAL segment renaming.
-   Resolved a `VACUUM` issue on `AOCS` tables following an aborted `ADD COLUMN` transaction.
-   Corrected `pg_exttable` view outputs specifically for ARM systems.
-   Implemented recursive calls in the plan walker for `MergeAppend` to ensure plan integrity.
-   Fixed a logic error involving `SubPlan PlaceHolderVar`.
-   Removed extra blank lines in `EXPLAIN` output. 
-   Silenced harmless `fsync` errors when parent directories are removed. 
-   Fixed a `NULL` pointer error during `COPY (SELECT) TO` option validation.
-   Dispatched ICU collation comments correctly.
-   Stopped reporting `compresstype`, `zlib`, or `zstd` errors when not in the validation phase.
-   Fixed inconsistent test cases for `REINDEX TABLE`, `REINDEX INDEX`, and `EXPLAIN FORMAT`.
-   Fixed the `gpcheckcat` `mix_distribution_policy` test.
-   Replaced the deprecated Python pipes module. 
-   Removed `gsutil` from developer requirements. 

### Security

-   Included a fix for [CVE-2025-1094](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-mhw9-x46c-v6q4).  

## WarehousePG 7.2.2-WHPG

Released: 17 November 2025

WarehousePG 7.2.2-WHPG includes the following new features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes:

### Enhancements

-   Enabled parallel workers context for index builds to reduce execution time.
-   Optimized resource usage by skipping the sorting of in-memory tuples when a process is interrupted.
-   Configured WAL records to be inserted uncompressed as a fallback if compression fails.
-   Enhanced diagnostic output by printing the specific `errno` for copy program pipes.
