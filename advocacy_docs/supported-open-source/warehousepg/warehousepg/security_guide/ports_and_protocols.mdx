Lists network ports and protocols used within the WarehousePG cluster.

WarehousePG clients connect with TCP to the WarehousePG coordinator instance at the client connection port, 5432 by default. The listen port can be reconfigured in the postgresql.conf configuration file. Client connections use the PostgreSQL libpq API. The `psql` command-line interface, several WarehousePG utilities, and language-specific programming APIs all either use the libpq library directly or implement the libpq protocol internally.

Each segment instance also has a client connection port, used solely by the coordinator instance to coordinate database operations with the segments. The `gpstate -p` command, run on the WarehousePG coordinator, lists the port assignments for the WarehousePG coordinator and the primary segments and mirrors. For example:

```
[gpadmin@cdw ~]$ gpstate -p

Additional WarehousePG network connections are created for features such as standby replication, segment mirroring, statistics collection, and data exchange between segments. Some persistent connections are established when the database starts up and other transient connections are created during operations such as query execution. Transient connections for query execution processes, data movement, and statistics collection use available ports in the range 1025 to 65535 with both TCP and UDP protocols.

> **Note** To avoid port conflicts between WarehousePG and other applications when initializing WarehousePG, do not specify WarehousePG ports in the range specified by the operating system parameter `net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range`. For example, if `net.ipv4.ip_local_port_range = 10000 65535`, you could set the WarehousePG base port numbers to values outside of that range:

```
PORT_BASE = 6000
MIRROR_PORT_BASE = 7000
```

Some add-on products and services that work with WarehousePG have additional networking requirements. The following table lists ports and protocols used within the WarehousePG cluster, and includes services and applications that integrate with WarehousePG.

| Pgbouncer connection pooler                                    | TCP, libpq                            | The pgbouncer connection pooler runs between libpq clients and WarehousePG (or PostgreSQL) databases. While you can run it on the WarehousePG coordinator host, running pgbouncer on a host outside of the WarehousePG cluster is recommended. When it runs on a separate host, pgbouncer can act as a warm standby mechanism for the WarehousePG coordinator host, switching to the WarehousePG standby host without requiring clients to reconfigure. Set the client connection port and the WarehousePG coordinator host address and port in the [pgbouncer.ini](../utility_guide/ref/pgbouncer-ini.mdx) configuration file. |
