Describes WarehousePG events that are logged and should be monitored to detect security threats.

WarehousePG is capable of auditing a variety of events, including startup and shutdown of the system, segment database failures, SQL statements that result in an error, and all connection attempts and disconnections. WarehousePG also logs SQL statements and information regarding SQL statements, and can be configured in a variety of ways to record audit information with more or less detail. The `log_error_verbosity` configuration parameter controls the amount of detail written in the server log for each message that is logged.  Similarly, the `log_min_error_statement` parameter allows administrators to configure the level of detail recorded specifically for SQL statements, and the `log_statement` parameter determines the kind of SQL statements that are audited. WarehousePG records the username for all auditable events, when the event is initiated by a subject outside the WarehousePG.

WarehousePG prevents unauthorized modification and deletion of audit records by only allowing administrators with an appropriate role to perform any operations on log files.  Logs are stored in a proprietary format using comma-separated values (CSV).  Each segment and the coordinator stores its own log files, although these can be accessed remotely by an administrator.  WarehousePG also authorizes overwriting of old log files via the `log_truncate_on_rotation` parameter.  This is a local parameter and must be set on each segment and coordinator configuration file.

WarehousePG provides an administrative schema called `gp_toolkit` that you can use to query log files, as well as system catalogs and operating environment for system status information. For more information, including usage, refer to *The gp_tookit Administrative Schema* appendix in the *WarehousePG Reference Guide*.

WarehousePG includes the PostgreSQL Audit Extension, or [pgaudit](../ref_guide/modules/pgaudit.mdx), which provides detailed session and object audit logging via the standard logging facility provided by PostgreSQL. The goal of PostgreSQL Audit is to provide the tools needed to produce audit logs required to pass certain government, financial, or ISO certification audits.

## Viewing the Database Server Log Files

Every database instance in WarehousePG (coordinator and segments) is a running PostgreSQL database server with its own server log file. Daily log files are created in the `log` directory of the coordinator and each segment data directory.

The server log files are written in comma-separated values (CSV) format. Not all log entries will have values for all of the log fields. For example, only log entries associated with a query worker process will have the `slice_id` populated. Related log entries of a particular query can be identified by its session identifier (`gp_session_id`) and command identifier (`gp_command_count`).

WarehousePG provides a utility called `gplogfilter` that can be used to search through a WarehousePG log file for entries matching the specified criteria. By default, this utility searches through the WarehousePG coordinator log file in the default logging location. For example, to display the last three lines of the coordinator log file:

```
$ gplogfilter -n 3
```

You can also use `gplogfilter` to search through all segment log files at once by running it through the `gpssh` utility. For example, to display the last three lines of each segment log file:

```
$ gpssh -f seg_host_file
  => source /usr/local/greenplum-db/greenplum_path.sh
  => gplogfilter -n 3 /data*/*/gp*/pg_log/gpdb*.csv
```

The following are the WarehousePG security-related audit (or logging) server configuration parameters that are set in the postgresql.conf configuration file:

Truncation will occur only when a new file is being opened due to time-based rotation. For example, using this setting in combination with a log_filename such as gpseg#-%H.log would result in generating twenty-four hourly log files and then cyclically overwriting them. When off, pre-existing files will be appended to in all cases.     |
