## <a id="topic_oy5_21n_1jb"></a>Installing WarehousePG

You must install WarehousePG on each host machine of the WarehousePG cluster. 

WarehousePG software aiss a downloadable package that you install on each host system with the operating system's package management system. 

Open source WarehousePG releases are available as RPM installers for RHEL Linux.

### <a id="topic_download"></a>Downloading the WarehousePG Server Software (WarehousePG)

You can download the *WarehousePG Server* software package from the github repo. 

Be sure to note the name and the file system location of the downloaded file.

### <a id="topic_install"></a>Installing WarehousePG

Before you begin installing WarehousePG, be sure you have completed the steps in [Configure Operating System](config_os.mdx) to configure each of the coordinator, standby coordinator, and segment host machines for WarehousePG.

> **Important** After installing WarehousePG, you must set WarehousePG environment variables. See [Setting WarehousePG Environment Variables](init_whpg.mdx).

Follow these instructions to install WarehousePG from a pre-built binary.

> **Important** You require sudo or root user access to install from a pre-built RPM or DEB file.

1.  Download and copy the WarehousePG package to the `gpadmin` user's home directory on the coordinator, standby coordinator, and every segment host machine. The distribution file name has the format `greenplum-db-<version>-<platform>.rpm` for RHEL, Oracle Linux, or Rocky Linux systems.

    > **Note** For Oracle Linux or Rocky Linux installations, download and install the `rhel8-x86_64`distribution files.

2.  With sudo (or as root), install the WarehousePG package on each host machine using your system's package manager software:

    ```
    $ sudo yum install ./greenplum-db-<version>-<platform>.rpm
    ```

    The `yum` command automatically installs software dependencies, copies the WarehousePG software files into a version-specific directory under `/usr/local`, `/usr/local/greenplum-db-<version>`, and creates the symbolic link `/usr/local/greenplum-db` to the installation directory.

3.  Change the owner and group of the installed files to `gpadmin`:

    ```
    $ sudo chown -R gpadmin:gpadmin /usr/local/greenplum*
    $ sudo chgrp -R gpadmin /usr/local/greenplum*
    ```

## <a id="topic_dj4_ssr_cmb"></a>(Optional) Installing to a Non-Default Directory

On RHEL systems, you can use the `rpm` command with the `--prefix` option to install WarehousePG to a non-default directory (instead of under `/usr/local`). Note, however, that using `rpm` does not automatically install WarehousePG dependencies; you must manually install dependencies to each host system.

Follow these instructions to install WarehousePG to a specific directory.

> **Important** You require sudo or root user access to install from a pre-built RPM file.

1.  Download and copy the WarehousePG package to the `gpadmin` user's home directory on the coordinator, standby coordinator, and every segment host machine. The distribution file name has the format `greenplum-db-<version>-rhel8-x86_64.rpm` for RHEL/Oracle/Rocky Linux systems.

2.  Manually install the WarehousePG dependencies to each host system:

    ```
    $ sudo yum install apr apr-util bash bzip2 curl krb5 libcurl libevent \
    libxml2 libyaml zlib openldap openssh openssl openssl-libs perl readline rsync R sed tar zip
    ```

3.  Use `rpm` with the `--prefix` option to install the WarehousePG package to your chosen installation directory on each host machine:

    ```
    $ sudo rpm --install ./greenplum-db-<version>-<platform>.rpm --prefix=<directory>
    ```

    The `rpm` command copies the WarehousePG software files into a version-specific directory under your chosen `<directory>`, `<directory>/greenplum-db-<version>`, and creates the symbolic link `<directory>/greenplum-db` to the versioned directory.

4.  Change the owner and group of the installed files to `gpadmin`:

    ```
    $ sudo chown -R gpadmin:gpadmin <directory>/greenplum*
    ```

> **Note** All example procedures in the WarehousePG documentation assume that you installed to the default directory, which is `/usr/local`. If you install to a non-default directory, substitute that directory for `/usr/local`.

If you install to a non-default directory using `rpm`, you will need to continue using `rpm` (and of `yum`) to perform minor version upgrades; these changes are covered in the upgrade documentation.

## <a id="topic_xmb_gb5_vhb"></a>Enabling Passwordless SSH

The `gpadmin` user on each WarehousePG host must be able to SSH from any host in the cluster to any other host in the cluster without entering a password or passphrase (called "passwordless SSH"). If you enable passwordless SSH from the coordinator host to every other host in the cluster ("1-*n* passwordless SSH"), you can use the WarehousePG `gpssh-exkeys` command-line utility to enable passwordless SSH from every host to every other host ("*n*-*n* passwordless SSH").

1.  Log in to the coordinator host as the `gpadmin` user.

2.  Source the `path` file in the WarehousePG installation directory.

    ```
    $ source /usr/local/greenplum-db-<version>/greenplum_path.sh
    ```

    > **Note** Add the above `source` command to the `gpadmin` user's `.bashrc` or other shell startup file so that the WarehousePG path and environment variables are set whenever you log in as `gpadmin`.

3.  Use the `ssh-copy-id` command to add the `gpadmin` user's public key to the `authorized_hosts` SSH file on every other host in the cluster.

    ```
    $ ssh-copy-id scdw
    $ ssh-copy-id sdw1
    $ ssh-copy-id sdw2
    $ ssh-copy-id sdw3
    . . .
    ```

    This enables 1-*n* passwordless SSH. You will be prompted to enter the `gpadmin` user's password for each host. If you have the `sshpass` command on your system, you can use a command like the following to avoid the prompt.

    ```
    $ SSHPASS=<password> sshpass -e ssh-copy-id scdw
    ```

4.  In the `gpadmin` home directory, create a file named `hostfile_exkeys` that has the machine configured host names and host addresses (interface names) for each host in your WarehousePG cluster (coordinator, standby coordinator, and segment hosts). Make sure there are no blank lines or extra spaces. Check the `/etc/hosts` file on your systems for the correct host names to use for your environment. For example, if you have a coordinator, standby coordinator, and three segment hosts with two unbonded network interfaces per host, your file would look something like this:

    ```
    cdw
    cdw-1
    cdw-2
    scdw
    scdw-1
    scdw-2
    sdw1
    sdw1-1
    sdw1-2
    sdw2
    sdw2-1
    sdw2-2
    sdw3
    sdw3-1
    sdw3-2
    ```

5.  Run the `gpssh-exkeys` utility with your `hostfile_exkeys` file to enable *n*-*n* passwordless SSH for the `gpadmin` user.

    ```
    $ gpssh-exkeys -f hostfile_exkeys
    ```

## <a id="topic10"></a>Confirming Your Installation

To make sure the WarehousePG software was installed and configured correctly, run the following confirmation steps from your WarehousePG coordinator host. If necessary, correct any problems before continuing on to the next task.

1.  Log in to the coordinator host as `gpadmin`:

    ```
    $ su - gpadmin
    ```

2.  Use the `gpssh` utility to see if you can log in to all hosts without a password prompt, and to confirm that the WarehousePG software was installed on all hosts. Use the `hostfile_exkeys` file you used to set up passwordless SSH. For example:

    ```
    $ gpssh -f hostfile_exkeys -e 'ls -l /usr/local/greenplum-db-<version>'
    ```

    If the installation was successful, you should be able to log in to all hosts without a password prompt. All hosts should show that they have the same contents in their installation directories, and that the directories are owned by the `gpadmin` user.

    If you are prompted for a password, run the following command to redo the ssh key exchange:

    ```
    $ gpssh-exkeys -f hostfile_exkeys
    ```
