You can configure a new WarehousePG cluster with a standby coordinator using `gpinitsystem` or enable it later using `gpinitstandby`. This topic assumes you are adding a standby coordinator to an existing system that was initialized without one.

For information about the utilities [gpinitsystem](../../utility_guide/ref/gpinitsystem.mdx) and [gpinitstandby](../../utility_guide/ref/gpinitstandby.mdx), see the *WarehousePG Utility Guide*.

## To add a standby coordinator to an existing system

1.  Ensure the standby coordinator host is installed and configured: `gpadmin` system user created, WarehousePG binaries installed, environment variables set, SSH keys exchanged, and that the data directories and tablespace directories, if needed, are created.
2.  Run the `gpinitstandby` utility on the currently active *primary* coordinator host to add a standby coordinator host to your WarehousePG cluster. For example:

    ```
    $ gpinitstandby -s scdw
    ```

    Where `-s` specifies the standby coordinator host name.

To switch operations to a standby coordinator, see [Recovering a Failed Coordinator](recovering-a-failed-coordinator.mdx).

## To check the status of the coordinator mirroring process (optional)

You can run the `gpstate` utility with the `-f` option to display details of the standby coordinator host.

```
$ gpstate -f
```

The standby coordinator status should be passive, and the WAL sender state should be streaming.

For information about the [gpstate](../../utility_guide/ref/gpstate.mdx) utility, see the *WarehousePG Utility Guide*.
