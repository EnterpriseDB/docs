The `gpfdist://` protocol is used in a URI to reference a running `gpfdist` instance.

The [gpfdist](../../utility_guide/ref/gpfdist.mdx) utility serves external data files from a directory on a file host to all WarehousePG segments in parallel.

`gpfdist` is located in the `$GPHOME/bin` directory on your WarehousePG coordinator host and on each segment host.

Run `gpfdist` on the host where the external data files reside. For readable external tables, `gpfdist` uncompresses `gzip` (`.gz`) and `bzip2` (.`bz2`) files automatically. For writable external tables, data is compressed using `gzip` if the target file has a `.gz` extension. You can use the wildcard character (\*) or other C-style pattern matching to denote multiple files to read. The files specified are assumed to be relative to the directory that you specified when you started the `gpfdist` instance.

> **Note** Compression is not supported for readable and writeable external tables when the `gpfdist` utility runs on Windows platforms.

All primary segments access the external file(s) in parallel, subject to the number of segments set in the `gp_external_max_segments` server configuration parameter. Use multiple `gpfdist` data sources in a `CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE` statement to scale the external table's scan performance.

`gpfdist` supports data transformations. You can write a transformation process to convert external data from or to a format that is not directly supported with WarehousePG external tables.

For more information about configuring `gpfdist`, see [Using the WarehousePG Parallel File Server (gpfdist)](using-gpfdist.mdx).

See the `gpfdist` reference documentation for more information about using `gpfdist` with external tables.
