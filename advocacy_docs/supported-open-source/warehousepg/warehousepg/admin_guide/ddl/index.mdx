This section covers data definition language (DDL) in WarehousePG and how to create and manage database objects.

Creating objects in a WarehousePG includes making up-front choices about data distribution, storage options, data loading, and other WarehousePG features that will affect the ongoing performance of your database system. Understanding the options that are available and how the database will be used will help you make the right decisions.

Most of the advanced WarehousePG features are enabled with extensions to the SQL `CREATE` DDL statements.
