This topic explains how to configure client connections and authentication for WarehousePG.

When a WarehousePG cluster is first initialized, the system contains one predefined *superuser* role. This role will have the same name as the operating system user who initialized the WarehousePG cluster. This role is referred to as `gpadmin`. By default, the system is configured to only allow local connections to the database from the `gpadmin` role. If you want to allow any other roles to connect, or if you want to allow connections from remote hosts, you have to configure WarehousePG to allow such connections. This section explains how to configure client connections and authentication to WarehousePG.

## Allowing Connections to WarehousePG

Client access and authentication is controlled by the standard PostgreSQL host-based authentication file, pg_hba.conf. For detailed information about this file, see [The pg_hba.conf File](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/auth-pg-hba-conf.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

In WarehousePG, the pg_hba.conf file of the coordinator instance controls client access and authentication to your WarehousePG cluster. The WarehousePG segments also have pg_hba.conf files, but these are already correctly configured to allow only client connections from the coordinator host. The segments never accept outside client connections, so there is no need to alter the `pg_hba.conf` file on segments.

The general format of the pg_hba.conf file is a set of records, one per line. WarehousePG ignores blank lines and any text after the `#` comment character. A record consists of a number of fields that are separated by spaces or tabs. Fields can contain white space if the field value is quoted. Records cannot be continued across lines. Each remote client access record has the following format:

```
host   database   role   address   authentication-method
```

Each UNIX-domain socket access record is in this format:

```
local   database   role   authentication-method
```

The following table describes meaning of each field.

                  address (for example, reverse DNS lookup, if DNS is used). Host name comparisons
                  are case insensitive. If there is a match, then a forward name resolution (for
                  example, forward DNS lookup) is performed on the host name to check whether any of
                  the addresses it resolves to are equal to the client IP address. If both

                  The host name that is used in <code class="ph codeph">pg_hba.conf</code> must be the one that

**CAUTION:** For a more secure system, consider removing records for remote connections that use trust authentication from the `pg_hba.conf` file. Trust authentication grants any user who can connect to the server access to the database using any role they specify. You can safely replace trust authentication with ident authentication for local UNIX-socket connections. You can also use ident authentication for local and remote TCP clients, but the client host must be running an ident service and you must trust the integrity of that machine.

<a id="topic3"></a>

### Editing the pg_hba.conf File

Initially, the `pg_hba.conf` file is set up with generous permissions for the gpadmin user and no database access for other WarehousePG roles. You will need to edit the `pg_hba.conf` file to enable users' access to databases and to secure the gpadmin user. Consider removing entries that have trust authentication, since they allow anyone with access to the server to connect with any role they choose. For local (UNIX socket) connections, use ident authentication, which requires the operating system user to match the role specified. For local and remote TCP connections, ident authentication requires the client's host to run an indent service. You can install an ident service on the coordinator host and then use ident authentication for local TCP connections, for example `127.0.0.1/28`. Using ident authentication for remote TCP connections is less secure because it requires you to trust the integrity of the ident service on the client's host.

This example shows how to edit the pg_hba.conf file of the coordinator to allow remote client access to all databases from all roles using encrypted password authentication.

<a id="ip144328"></a>

#### Editing pg_hba.conf

1.  Open the file $COORDINATOR_DATA_DIRECTORY/pg_hba.conf in a text editor.

2.  Add a line to the file for each type of connection you want to allow. Records are read sequentially, so the order of the records is significant. Typically, earlier records will have tight connection match parameters and weaker authentication methods, while later records will have looser match parameters and stronger authentication methods. For example:

    ```
    # allow the gpadmin user local access to all databases
    # using ident authentication
    local   all   gpadmin   ident         sameuser
    host    all   gpadmin   127.0.0.1/32  ident
    host    all   gpadmin   ::1/128       ident
    # allow the 'dba' role access to any database from any
    # host with IP address 192.168.x.x and use md5 encrypted
    # passwords to authenticate the user
    # Note that to use SHA-256 encryption, replace md5 with
    # password in the line below
    host    all   dba   192.168.0.0/32  md5
    # allow all roles access to any database from any
    # host and use ldap to authenticate the user. WarehousePG role
    # names must match the LDAP common name.
    host    all   all   192.168.0.0/32  ldap ldapserver=usldap1 ldapport=1389 ldapprefix="cn=" ldapsuffix=",ou=People,dc=company,dc=com"
    ```

3.  Save and close the file.

4.  Reload the pg_hba.conf configuration file for your changes to take effect:

    ```
    $ gpstop -u
    ```

> **Note** Note that you can also control database access by setting object privileges as described in [Managing Object Privileges](roles_privs.mdx). The pg_hba.conf file just controls who can initiate a database session and how those connections are authenticated.

## Limiting Concurrent Connections

WarehousePG allocates some resources on a per-connection basis, so setting the maximum number of connections allowed is recommended.

To limit the number of active concurrent sessions to your WarehousePG cluster, you can configure the `max_connections` server configuration parameter. This is a *local* parameter, meaning that you must set it in the `postgresql.conf` file of the coordinator, the standby coordinator, and each segment instance (primary and mirror). The recommended value of `max_connections` on segments is 5-10 times the value on the coordinator.

When you set `max_connections`, you must also set the dependent parameter `max_prepared_transactions`. This value must be at least as large as the value of `max_connections` on the coordinator, and segment instances should be set to the same value as the coordinator.

For example:

-   In `$COORDINATOR_DATA_DIRECTORY/postgresql.conf` (including standby coordinator):

    ```
    max_connections=100
    max_prepared_transactions=100

    ```

-   In `SEGMENT_DATA_DIRECTORY/postgresql.conf` for all segment instances:

    ```
    max_connections=500
    max_prepared_transactions=100

    ```

The following steps set the parameter values with the WarehousePG utility `gpconfig`.

For information about `gpconfig`, see the *WarehousePG Utility Guide*.

<a id="ip142411"></a>

### To change the number of allowed connections

1.  Log into the WarehousePG coordinator host as the WarehousePG administrator and source the file `$GPHOME/greenplum_path.sh`.

2.  Set the value of the `max_connections` parameter. This `gpconfig` command sets the value on the segments to 1000 and the value on the coordinator to 200.

    ```
    $ gpconfig -c max_connections -v 1000 -m 200

    ```

    The value on the segments must be greater than the value on the coordinator. The recommended value of `max_connections` on segments is 5-10 times the value on the coordinator.

3.  Set the value of the `max_prepared_transactions` parameter. This `gpconfig` command sets the value to 200 on the coordinator and all segments.

    ```
    $ gpconfig -c max_prepared_transactions -v 200

    ```

    The value of `max_prepared_transactions` must be greater than or equal to `max_connections` on the coordinator.

4.  Stop and restart your WarehousePG cluster.

    ```
    $ gpstop -r

    ```

5.  You can check the value of parameters on the coordinator and segments with the `gpconfig` `-s` option. This `gpconfig` command displays the values of the `max_connections` parameter.

    ```
    $ gpconfig -s max_connections

    ```

> **Note** Raising the values of these parameters may cause WarehousePG to request more shared memory. To mitigate this effect, consider decreasing other memory-related parameters such as `gp_cached_segworkers_threshold`.

## Encrypting Client/Server Connections

Enable SSL for client connections to WarehousePG to encrypt the data passed over the network between the client and the database.

WarehousePG has native support for SSL connections between the client and the coordinator server. SSL connections prevent third parties from snooping on the packets, and also prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. SSL should be used whenever the client connection goes through an insecure link, and must be used whenever client certificate authentication is used.

Enabling WarehousePG in SSL mode requires the following items.

-   OpenSSL installed on both the client and the coordinator server hosts (coordinator and standby coordinator).

-   The SSL files server.key (server private key) and server.crt (server certificate) should be correctly generated for the coordinator host and standby coordinator host.

    -   The private key should not be protected with a passphrase. The server does not prompt for a passphrase for the private key, and WarehousePG start up fails with an error if one is required.
    -   On a production system, there should be a key and certificate pair for the coordinator host and a pair for the standby coordinator host with a subject CN (Common Name) for the coordinator host and standby coordinator host.
        A self-signed certificate can be used for testing, but a certificate signed by a certificate authority (CA) should be used in production, so the client can verify the identity of the server. Either a global or local CA can be used. If all the clients are local to the organization, a local CA is recommended.

-   Ensure that WarehousePG can access server.key and server.crt, and any additional authentication files such as `root.crt` (for trusted certificate authorities). When starting in SSL mode, the WarehousePG coordinator looks for server.key and server.crt. As the default, WarehousePG does not start if the files are not in the coordinator data directory (`$COORDINATOR_DATA_DIRECTORY`). Also, if you use other SSL authentication files such as `root.crt` (trusted certificate authorities), the files must be on the coordinator host.

    If WarehousePG coordinator mirroring is enabled with SSL client authentication, SSL authentication files must be on both the coordinator host and standby coordinator host and *should not be placed* in the default directory `$COORDINATOR_DATA_DIRECTORY`. When coordinator mirroring is enabled, an `initstandby` operation copies the contents of the `$COORDINATOR_DATA_DIRECTORY` from the coordinator to the standby coordinator and the incorrect SSL key, and cert files (the coordinator files, and not the standby coordinator files) will prevent standby coordinator start up.

    You can specify a different directory for the location of the SSL server files with the `postgresql.conf` parameters `sslcert`, `sslkey`, `sslrootcert`, and `sslcrl`. For more information about the parameters, see [SSL Client Authentication](../security_guide/authentication.mdx) in the *Security Configuration Guide*.

WarehousePG can be started with SSL enabled by setting the server configuration parameter `ssl=on` in the `postgresql.conf` file on the coordinator and standby coordinator hosts. This `gpconfig` command sets the parameter:

```
gpconfig -c ssl -m on -v off
```

Setting the parameter requires a server restart. This command restarts the system: `gpstop -ra`.

### Creating a Self-signed Certificate without a Passphrase for Testing Only

To create a quick self-signed certificate for the server for testing, use the following OpenSSL command:

```
# openssl req -new -text -out server.req

```

Enter the information requested by the prompts. Be sure to enter the local host name as *Common Name*. The challenge password can be left blank.

The program will generate a key that is passphrase protected, and does not accept a passphrase that is less than four characters long.

To use this certificate with WarehousePG, remove the passphrase with the following commands:

```
# openssl rsa -in privkey.pem -out server.key
# rm privkey.pem
```

Enter the old passphrase when prompted to unlock the existing key.

Then, enter the following command to turn the certificate into a self-signed certificate and to copy the key and certificate to a location where the server will look for them.

```
# openssl req -x509 -in server.req -text -key server.key -out server.crt
```

Finally, change the permissions on the key with the following command. The server will reject the file if the permissions are less restrictive than these.

```
# chmod og-rwx server.key
```

For more details on how to create your server private key and certificate, refer to the [OpenSSL documentation](https://www.openssl.org/docs/).
