You can monitor a WarehousePG cluster using a variety of tools included with the system or available as add-ons.

Observing the WarehousePG cluster day-to-day performance helps administrators understand the system behavior, plan workflow, and troubleshoot problems. This chapter discusses tools for monitoring database performance and activity.

Also, be sure to review [Recommended Monitoring and Maintenance Tasks](../monitoring) for monitoring activities you can script to quickly detect problems in the system.

**Parent topic:** [Managing a WarehousePG cluster](./)

## Monitoring System State

As a WarehousePG administrator, you must monitor the system for problem events such as a segment going down or running out of disk space on a segment host. The following topics describe how to monitor the health of a WarehousePG cluster and examine certain state information for a WarehousePG cluster.

## Checking System State

A WarehousePG cluster is comprised of multiple PostgreSQL instances (the coordinator and segments) spanning multiple machines. To monitor a WarehousePG cluster, you need to know information about the system as a whole, as well as status information of the individual instances. The `gpstate` utility provides status information about a WarehousePG cluster.

<a id="topic13"></a>

### Viewing Coordinator and Segment Status and Configuration

The default `gpstate` action is to check segment instances and show a brief status of the valid and failed segments. For example, to see a quick status of your WarehousePG cluster:

```
$ gpstate

```

To see more detailed information about your WarehousePG cluster configuration, use `gpstate` with the `-s` option:

```
$ gpstate -s

```

<a id="topic14"></a>

### Viewing Your Mirroring Configuration and Status

If you are using mirroring for data redundancy, you may want to see the list of mirror segment instances in the system, their current synchronization status, and the mirror to primary mapping. For example, to see the mirror segments in the system and their status:

```
$ gpstate -m 

```

To see the primary to mirror segment mappings:

```
$ gpstate -c

```

To see the status of the standby coordinator mirror:

```
$ gpstate -f

```

<a id="topic15"></a>

## Checking Disk Space Usage

A database administrator's most important monitoring task is to make sure the file systems where the coordinator and segment data directories reside do not grow to more than 70 percent full. A filled data disk will not result in data corruption, but it may prevent normal database activity from continuing. If the disk grows too full, it can cause the database server to shut down.

You can use the `gp_disk_free` external table in the `gp_toolkit` administrative schema to check for remaining free space (in kilobytes) on the segment host file systems. For example:

```
=# SELECT * FROM gp_toolkit.gp_disk_free 
   ORDER BY dfsegment;

```

<a id="topic16"></a>

### Checking Sizing of Distributed Databases and Tables

The `gp_toolkit` administrative schema contains several views that you can use to determine the disk space usage for a distributed WarehousePG database, schema, table, or index.

For a list of the available sizing views for checking database object sizes and disk space, see the *WarehousePG Reference Guide*.

<a id="topic17"></a>

#### Viewing Disk Space Usage for a Database

To see the total size of a database (in bytes), use the *gp_size_of_database* view in the *gp_toolkit* administrative schema. For example:

```
=> SELECT * FROM gp_toolkit.gp_size_of_database 
   ORDER BY sodddatname;

```

<a id="topic18"></a>

#### Viewing Disk Space Usage for a Table

The *gp_toolkit* administrative schema contains several views for checking the size of a table. The table sizing views list the table by object ID (not by name). To check the size of a table by name, you must look up the relation name (`relname`) in the *pg_class* table. For example:

```
=> SELECT relname AS name, sotdsize AS size, sotdtoastsize 
   AS toast, sotdadditionalsize AS other 
   FROM gp_toolkit.gp_size_of_table_disk as sotd, pg_class 
   WHERE sotd.sotdoid=pg_class.oid ORDER BY relname;

```

For a list of the available table sizing views, see the *WarehousePG Reference Guide*.

<a id="topic19"></a>

#### Viewing Disk Space Usage for Indexes

The *gp_toolkit* administrative schema contains a number of views for checking index sizes. To see the total size of all index(es) on a table, use the *gp_size_of_all_table_indexes* view. To see the size of a particular index, use the *gp_size_of_index* view. The index sizing views list tables and indexes by object ID (not by name). To check the size of an index by name, you must look up the relation name (`relname`) in the *pg_class* table. For example:

```
=> SELECT soisize, relname as indexname
   FROM pg_class, gp_toolkit.gp_size_of_index
   WHERE pg_class.oid=gp_size_of_index.soioid 
   AND pg_class.relkind='i';

```

<a id="topic20"></a>

## Checking for Data Distribution Skew

All tables in WarehousePG are distributed, meaning their data is divided across all of the segments in the system. Unevenly distributed data may diminish query processing performance. A table's distribution policy, set at table creation time, determines how the table's rows are distributed. For information about choosing the table distribution policy, see the following topics:

-   [Viewing a Table's Distribution Key](#topic21)
-   [Viewing Data Distribution](#topic22)
-   [Checking for Query Processing Skew](#topic23)

The *gp_toolkit* administrative schema also contains a number of views for checking data distribution skew on a table. For information about how to check for uneven data distribution, see the *WarehousePG Reference Guide*.

<a id="topic21"></a>

### Viewing a Table's Distribution Key

To see the columns used as the data distribution key for a table, you can use the `\d+` meta-command in `psql` to examine the definition of a table. For example:

```
=# `\d+ sales
`                Table "retail.sales"
 Column      |     Type     | Modifiers | Description
-------------+--------------+-----------+-------------
 sale_id     | integer      |           |
 amt         | float        |           |
 date        | date         |           |
Has OIDs: no
Distributed by: (sale_id)

```

When you create a *replicated* table, WarehousePG stores all rows in the table on every segment. Replicated tables have no distribution key. Where the `\d+` meta-command reports the distribution key for a normally distributed table, it shows `Distributed Replicated` for a replicated table.

<a id="topic22"></a>

### Viewing Data Distribution

To see the data distribution of a table's rows (the number of rows on each segment), you can run a query such as:

```
=# SELECT gp_segment_id, count(*) 
   FROM <table_name> GROUP BY gp_segment_id;

```

A table is considered to have a balanced distribution if all segments have roughly the same number of rows.

> **Note** If you run this query on a replicated table, it fails because WarehousePG does not permit user queries to reference the system column `gp_segment_id` (or the system columns `ctid`, `cmin`, `cmax`, `xmin`, and `xmax`) in replicated tables. Because every segment has all of the tables' rows, replicated tables are evenly distributed by definition.

<a id="topic23"></a>

### Checking for Query Processing Skew

When a query is being processed, all segments should have equal workloads to ensure the best possible performance. If you identify a poorly-performing query, you may need to investigate further using the `EXPLAIN` command. For information about using the `EXPLAIN` command and query profiling, see [Query Profiling](../query/topics/query-profiling.mdx).

Query processing workload can be skewed if the table's data distribution policy and the query predicates are not well matched. To check for processing skew, you can run a query such as:

```
=# SELECT gp_segment_id, count(*) FROM <table_name>
   WHERE <column>='<value>' GROUP BY gp_segment_id;

```

This will show the number of rows returned by segment for the given `WHERE` predicate.

As noted in [Viewing Data Distribution](#topic22), this query will fail if you run it on a replicated table because you cannot reference the `gp_segment_id` system column in a query on a replicated table.

<a id="avoidskew"></a>

#### Avoiding an Extreme Skew Warning

You may receive the following warning message while running a query that performs a hash join operation:

`Extreme skew in the innerside of Hashjoin`

This occurs when the input to a hash join operator is skewed. It does not prevent the query from completing successfully. You can follow these steps to avoid skew in the plan:

1.  Ensure that all fact tables are analyzed.
2.  Verify that any populated temporary table used by the query is analyzed.
3.  View the `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` plan for the query and look for the following:
    -   If there are scans with multi-column filters that are producing more rows than estimated, then set the `gp_selectivity_damping_factor` server configuration parameter to 2 or higher and retest the query.
    -   If the skew occurs while joining a single fact table that is relatively small (less than 5000 rows), set the `gp_segments_for_planner` server configuration parameter to 1 and retest the query.
4.  Check whether the filters applied in the query match distribution keys of the base tables. If the filters and distribution keys are the same, consider redistributing some of the base tables with different distribution keys.
5.  Check the cardinality of the join keys. If they have low cardinality, try to rewrite the query with different joining columns or additional filters on the tables to reduce the number of rows. These changes could change the query semantics.

## Checking for and Terminating Overflowed Backends

Subtransaction overflow arises when a WarehousePG backend creates more than 64 subtransactions, resulting in a high lookup cost for visibility checks. This slows query performance, but even more so when it occurs in combination with long-running transactions, which result in still more lookups. Terminating suboverflowed backends and/or backends with long-running transactions can help prevent and alleviate performance problems. 

WarehousePG includes a view -- `gp_suboverflowed_backend` -- that is run over a user-defined function to help users query for suboverflowed backends. Users can use segment id and process id information reported in the view to terminate the offending backends, thereby preventing degradation of performance.

<a id="check_backends"></a>

### Steps

Follow these steps below to identify and terminate overflowed backends.

1.  Select all from the view:

    ```
    select * from gp_suboverflowed_backend`;
    ```

     This returns output similar to the following:

    ```
    segid |   pids    
    -------+-----------
    -1 | 
     0 | {1731513}
     1 | {1731514}
     2 | {1731515}
    (4 rows)
    ```

2.  Connect to the database in utility mode and query `pg_stat_activity` to return the session id for the process id in the output for a segment. For example: 

    ```
    select sess_id from pg_stat_activity where pid=1731513;
    ```

    ```
    sess_id 
    ---------
      10
    (1 row)
    ```

3.  Terminate the session, which will terminate all associated backends on all segments:

    ```
    select pg_terminate_backend(pid) from pg_stat_activity where sess_id=10;
    ```

4.  Verify that there are no more suboverflowed backends:

    ```
    select * from gp_suboverflowed_backend`;
    ```

    ```
    segid |   pids    
    -------+-----------
    -1 | 
     0 |
     1 | 
     2 | 
    (4 rows)
    ```

## Viewing Metadata Information about Database Objects

WarehousePG tracks various metadata information in its system catalogs about the objects stored in a database, such as tables, views, indexes and so on, as well as global objects such as roles and tablespaces.

<a id="topic25"></a>

### Viewing the Last Operation Performed

You can use the system views *pg_stat_operations* and *pg_stat_partition_operations* to look up actions performed on an object, such as a table. For example, to see the actions performed on a table, such as when it was created and when it was last vacuumed and analyzed:

```
=> SELECT schemaname as schema, objname as table, 
   usename as role, actionname as action, 
   subtype as type, statime as time 
   FROM pg_stat_operations 
   WHERE objname='cust';
 schema | table | role | action  | type  | time
--------+-------+------+---------+-------+--------------------------
  sales | cust  | main | CREATE  | TABLE | 2016-02-09 18:10:07.867977-08
  sales | cust  | main | VACUUM  |       | 2016-02-10 13:32:39.068219-08
  sales | cust  | main | ANALYZE |       | 2016-02-25 16:07:01.157168-08
(3 rows)

```

<a id="topic26"></a>

### Viewing the Definition of an Object

To see the definition of an object, such as a table or view, you can use the `\d+` meta-command when working in `psql`. For example, to see the definition of a table:

```
=> \d+ <mytable>

```

<a id="topic_slt_ddv_1q"></a>

## Viewing Session Memory Usage Information

You can create and use the *session_level_memory_consumption* view that provides information about the current memory utilization for sessions that are running queries on WarehousePG. The view contains session information and information such as the database that the session is connected to, the query that the session is currently running, and memory consumed by the session processes.

-   [Creating the session_level_memory_consumption View](#topic_nby_j1b_dq)
-   [The session_level_memory_consumption View](#topic7)

<a id="topic_nby_j1b_dq"></a>

### Creating the session_level_memory_consumption View

To create the *session_state.session_level_memory_consumption* view in a WarehousePG, run the script `CREATE EXTENSION gp_internal_tools;` once for each database. For example, to install the view in the database `testdb`, use this command:

```
$ psql -d testdb -c "CREATE EXTENSION gp_internal_tools;"
```

<a id="topic7"></a>

### The session_level_memory_consumption View

The *session_state.session_level_memory_consumption* view provides information about memory consumption and idle time for sessions that are running SQL queries.

When resource queue-based resource management is active, the column `is_runaway` indicates whether WarehousePG considers the session a runaway session based on the vmem memory consumption of the session's queries. Under the resource queue-based resource management scheme, WarehousePG considers the session a runaway when the queries consume an excessive amount of memory. The WarehousePG server configuration parameter `runaway_detector_activation_percent` governs the conditions under which WarehousePG considers a session a runaway session.

The `is_runaway`, `runaway_vmem_mb`, and `runaway_command_cnt` columns are not applicable when resource group-based resource management is active.

| column                | type        | references | description                                                                                                             |

<a id="topic_memcontext"></a>

## Viewing and Logging Per-Process Memory Usage Information

WarehousePG allocates all memory within memory contexts. Memory contexts provide a convenient way to manage allocations made in different places that need to live for differing amounts of time. Destroying a context releases all of the memory that was allocated in it.

Tracking the amount of memory used by a server process or a long-running query can help detect the source of a potential out-of-memory condition. WarehousePG provides a system view and administration functions that you can use for this purpose.

<a id="topic_memcontext_view"></a>

### About the pg_backend_memory_contexts View

To display the memory usage of all active memory contexts in the server process attached to the current session, use the [pg_backend_memory_contexts](../../ref_guide/system_catalogs/catalog_ref-views.mdx#pg_backend_memory_contexts) system view. This view is restricted to superusers, but access may be granted to other roles.

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_backend_memory_contexts;
```

<a id="topic_memcontext_func"></a>

### About the Memory Context Admin Functions

You can use the system administration function `pg_log_backend_memory_contexts()` to instruct WarehousePG to dump the memory usage of other sessions running on the coordinator host into the server log. Execution of this function is restricted to superusers only, and cannot be granted to other roles.

The signature of `pg_log_backend_memory_contexts()` function follows:

```pre
pg_log_backend_memory_contexts( pid integer )
```

where `pid` identifies the process whose memory contexts you want dumped.

`pg_log_backend_memory_contexts()` returns `true` when memory context logging is successfully activated for the process on the local host. When logging is activated, WarehousePG writes one message to the log for each memory context at the `LOG` message level. The log messages appear in the server log based on the log configuration set; refer to [Error Reporting and Logging](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/runtime-config-logging.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation for more information. *The memory context log messages are not sent to the client*.

Memory context logging functions that dump memory usage across all WarehousePG segments, or dump usage for a specific segment are named `gp_log_backend_memory_contexts()`.

`gp_log_backend_memory_contexts()` has two signatures:

```pre
gp_log_backend_memory_contexts( sess_id integer )
gp_log_backend_memory_contexts( sess_id integer, contentId integer )
```

where `sess_id` is the WarehousePG identifier assigned to the session (typically obtained from the `pg_stat_activity` view), and `contentID` in the second signature identifies the segment instance of interest.

When you invoke `gp_log_backend_memory_contexts()` on the WarehousePG coordinator host, it invokes `pg_log_backend_memory_contexts()` on the individual segments, which in turn triggers a memory usage dump to each segment log. The functions return an integer identifying the number of segments on which memory context logging was successfully activated.

<a id="topic_memcontext_samplelog"></a>

### Sample Log Messages

The command:

```sql
SELECT pg_log_backend_memory_contexts( pg_backend_pid() );
```

triggered the dumping of the following (subset of) memory context messages to the local server log file:

```pre

## Viewing Query Workfile Usage Information

The WarehousePG administrative schema *gp_toolkit* contains views that display information about WarehousePG workfiles. WarehousePG creates workfiles on disk if it does not have sufficient memory to run the query in memory. This information can be used for troubleshooting and tuning queries. The information in the views can also be used to specify the values for the WarehousePG configuration parameters `gp_workfile_limit_per_query` and `gp_workfile_limit_per_segment`.

These are the views in the schema *gp_toolkit*:

-   The gp_workfile_entries view contains one row for each operator using disk space for workfiles on a segment at the current time.
-   The gp_workfile_usage_per_query view contains one row for each query using disk space for workfiles on a segment at the current time.
-   The gp_workfile_usage_per_segment view contains one row for each segment. Each row displays the total amount of disk space used for workfiles on the segment at the current time.

For information about using *gp_toolkit*, see [Using gp_toolkit](#topic31).

<a id="topic28"></a>

## Viewing the Database Server Log Files

Every database instance in WarehousePG (coordinator and segments) runs a PostgreSQL database server with its own server log file. Log files are created in the `log` directory of the coordinator and each segment data directory.

<a id="topic29"></a>

### Log File Format

The server log files are written in comma-separated values (CSV) format. Some log entries will not have values for all log fields. For example, only log entries associated with a query worker process will have the `slice_id` populated. You can identify related log entries of a particular query by the query's session identifier (`gp_session_id`) and command identifier (`gp_command_count`).

The following fields are written to the log:

### Searching the WarehousePG Server Log Files

WarehousePG provides a utility called `gplogfilter` can search through a WarehousePG log file for entries matching the specified criteria. By default, this utility searches through the WarehousePG coordinator log file in the default logging location. For example, to display the last three lines of each of the log files under the coordinator directory:

```
$ gplogfilter -n 3

```

To search through all segment log files simultaneously, run `gplogfilter` through the `gpssh` utility. For example, to display the last three lines of each segment log file:

```
$ gpssh -f seg_host_file

```

```
=> source /usr/local/greenplum-db/greenplum_path.sh
=> gplogfilter -n 3 /gpdata/gp*/log/gpdb*.log
```

## Using gp_toolkit

Use the WarehousePG administrative schema *gp_toolkit* to query the system catalogs, log files, and operating environment for system status information. The `gp_toolkit` schema contains several views you can access using SQL commands. The *gp_toolkit* schema is accessible to all database users. Some objects require superuser permissions. Use a command similar to the following to add the *gp_toolkit* schema to your schema search path:

```
=> ALTER ROLE myrole SET search_path TO myschema,gp_toolkit;
```

For a description of the available administrative schema views and their usages, see the *WarehousePG Reference Guide*.

## SQL Standard Error Codes

The following table lists all the defined error codes. Some are not used, but are defined by the SQL standard. The error classes are also shown. For each error class there is a standard error code having the last three characters 000. This code is used only for error conditions that fall within the class but do not have any more-specific code assigned.

The PL/pgSQL condition name for each error code is the same as the phrase shown in the table, with underscores substituted for spaces. For example, code 22012, DIVISION BY ZERO, has condition name DIVISION_BY_ZERO. Condition names can be written in either upper or lower case.

> **Note** PL/pgSQL does not recognize warning, as opposed to error, condition names; those are classes 00, 01, and 02.
