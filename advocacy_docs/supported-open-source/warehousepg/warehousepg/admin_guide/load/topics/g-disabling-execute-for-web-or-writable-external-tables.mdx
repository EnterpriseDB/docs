There is a security risk associated with allowing external tables to run OS commands or scripts. To deactivate the use of `EXECUTE` in web and writable external table definitions, set the `gp_external_enable_exec` server configuration parameter to off in your coordinator postgresql.conf file:

```
gp_external_enable_exec = off

```

> **Note** You must restart the database in order for changes to the `gp_external_enable_exec` server configuration parameter to take effect.
