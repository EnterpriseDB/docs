By default, `COPY` stops an operation at the first error: if the data contains an error, the operation fails and no data loads. If you run `COPY FROM` in *single row error isolation mode*, WarehousePG skips rows that contain format errors and loads properly formatted rows. Single row error isolation mode applies only to rows in the input file that contain format errors. If the data contains a constraint error such as violation of a `NOT NULL`, `CHECK`, or `UNIQUE` constraint, the operation fails and no data loads.

Specifying `SEGMENT REJECT LIMIT` runs the `COPY` operation in single row error isolation mode. Specify the acceptable number of error rows on each segment, after which the entire `COPY FROM` operation fails and no rows load. The error row count is for each WarehousePG segment, not for the entire load operation.

If the `COPY` operation does not reach the error limit, WarehousePG loads all correctly-formatted rows and discards the error rows. Use the `LOG ERRORS` clause to capture data formatting errors internally in WarehousePG. For example:

```
=> COPY country FROM '/data/gpdb/country_data' 
   WITH DELIMITER '|' LOG ERRORS
   SEGMENT REJECT LIMIT 10 ROWS;
```
