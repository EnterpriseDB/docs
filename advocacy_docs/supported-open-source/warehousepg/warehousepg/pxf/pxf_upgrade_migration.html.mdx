When you upgrade your WarehousePG cluster, you must perform some additional steps in order to bring your PXF configuration up to date.

1.  *WarehousePG 6.x to 6.newer upgrade*: You may be required to perform PXF upgrade actions when you [upgrade from a previous WarehousePG 6.x version](upgrade_pxf_6x.html). Note that different steps are outlined based on your PXF installation source: a manually installed `rpm` or `deb` or the PXF version included with the WarehousePG Server installer in versions 6.18.x and older. 

If you are upgrading a PXF `rpm` or `deb` installation independent of a WarehousePG upgrade, refer to the PXF upgrade documentation.
