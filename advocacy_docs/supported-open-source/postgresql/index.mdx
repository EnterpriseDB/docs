EDB is deeply involved with and committed to the PostgreSQL community with the goal of constantly improving and building upon the software. We’re active in promoting the adoption of PostgreSQL and related software worldwide, contributing every year since 2006. Some of our team members have been involved with the project since its inception in 1996, and continue to play a key role in shaping its future.
