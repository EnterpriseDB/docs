PostgreSQL is a popular and free open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). It has a reputation for reliability, performance, and extensibility, with a robust feature set to securely store and scale complex workloads.

For details on PostgreSQL, see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/).

EDB is deeply involved with and committed to the PostgreSQL community with the goal of constantly improving and building on the software. We actively promote adopting PostgreSQL and related software worldwide, contributing every year since 2006. Some of our team members have been involved with the project since its inception in 1996, and they continue to play a key role in shaping its future.
