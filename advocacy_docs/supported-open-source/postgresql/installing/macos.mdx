EDB provides MacOS installers for PostgreSQL on the [EDB downloads page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads). These installers simplify setting up a system. Rather than use the EDB installer, you can also obtain a prebuilt installation package and instructions directly from the [PostgreSQL downloads page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

For a detailed walk-through of the installation process on Mac OS, see [this tutorial](https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgres-tutorials/installation-postgresql-mac-os).

When the PostgreSQL installation finishes, you can optionally invoke the Stack Builder package manager. Stack Builder provides a graphical interface for downloading and installing applications, drivers, utilities, and their dependencies. See [Using Stack Builder](../03_using_stackbuilder) for more information.

!!! Note
    If you're using the graphical installation wizard to perform a system upgrade, the installer preserves the configuration options specified during the previous installation.

## Command-line tools

After installing PostgreSQL, you can run command-line tools by referencing them in the `bin` directory under the installation path you specified during installation. For example, to run `psql` from the default installation directory, enter:

```shell
/Library/PostgreSQL/12/bin/psql -U postgres
```

For ease of use, you can add this directory to your `PATH` by adding a line to your `~/.bash_profile`. If using zsh, add it instead to `~/.zshrc`.

```shell
export PATH="/Library/PostgreSQL/12/bin/:$PATH"
```

This step is especially important if you plan to use scripts or other software that rely on PostgreSQL tools, such as Python's `psycopg2`. You can instead [add this directory](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/106355/setting-the-system-wide-path-environment-variable-in-mavericks/106814#106814) to the system path.

Several other options for installing PostgreSQL on MacOS offer varying levels of flexibility, version support, add-ons, and so on. You find more details on [the PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/macosx/).
