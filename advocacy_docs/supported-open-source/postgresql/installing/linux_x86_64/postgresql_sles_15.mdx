title: Installing PostgreSQL on SLES 15 x86_64
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the EDB repository.

  !!! Note
  Rather than use the EDB repository, you can obtain PostgreSQL installers and installation packages from the [PostgreSQL community downloads page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
  !!!

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

  To determine if your repository exists, enter:

  `zypper lr -E | grep enterprisedb`

  If no output is generated, the repository is installed.

  To set up the EDB repository:

  1. Go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).

  1. Select the button that provides access to the EDB repository.

  1. Select the platform and software that you want to download.

  1. Follow the instructions for setting up the EDB repository.

- Activate the required SUSE module:
  ```shell
  sudo SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.7/x86_64

  ```
- Refresh the metadata:
  ```shell
  sudo zypper refresh
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo zypper -n install postgresql<xx>-server
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of PostgreSQL you are installing. For example, if you are installing version 17, the package name would be `postgresql17-server`.

Optionally, enable the development SUSE modules only if required:

```shell
sudo SUSEConnect -p sle-module-desktop-applications/15.7/x86_64
sudo SUSEConnect -p sle-module-development-tools/15.7/x86_64
sudo zypper install postgresql17-devel
```
