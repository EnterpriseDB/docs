title: Installing PostgreSQL on RHEL 7 or OL 7 x86_64

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the EDB repository

  !!! Note
  Rather than use the EDB repository, you can obtain PostgreSQL installers and installation packages from the [PostgreSQL community downloads page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
  !!!

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

  To determine if your repository exists, enter this command:

  `dnf repolist | grep enterprisedb`

  If no output is generated, the repository isn't installed.

  To set up the EDB repository:

  1. Go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).

  1. Select the button that provides access to the EDB repo.

  1. Select the platform and software that you want to download.

  1. Follow the instructions for setting up an EDB repo.

- Install the EPEL repository

  ```shell
  sudo yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
  ```

- Enable additional repositories to resolve dependencies
  ```shell
  subscription-manager repos --enable "rhel-*-optional-rpms" --enable "rhel-*-extras-rpms"  --enable "rhel-ha-for-rhel-*-server-rpms"
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo yum -y install postgresql<xx>-server postgresql<xx>-contrib
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of PostgreSQL you are installing. For example, if you are installing version 15, the package name would be `postgresql15-server postgresql15-contrib`.
