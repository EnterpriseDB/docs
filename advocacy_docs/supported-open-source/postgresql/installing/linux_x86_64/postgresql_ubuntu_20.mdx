title: Installing PostgreSQL on Ubuntu 20.04 x86_64
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the EDB repository.

  !!! Note
  Rather than use the EDB repository, you can obtain PostgreSQL installers and installation packages from the [PostgreSQL community downloads page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).
  !!!

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

  To determine if your repository exists, enter this command:

  `apt-cache search enterprisedb`

  If no output is generated, the repository isn't installed.

  To set up the EDB repository:

  1. Go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).

  1. Select the button that provides access to the EDB repository.

  1. Select the platform and software that you want to download.

  1. Follow the instructions for setting up the EDB repository.

## Install the package

```shell
sudo apt-get -y install postgresql-<xx>
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of PostgreSQL you are installing. For example, if you are installing version 16, the package name would be `postgresql-16`.
