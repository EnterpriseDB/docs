You can use the graphical installation wizard to install PostgreSQL on Windows. 

When the PostgreSQL installation finishes, you can optionally invoke the Stack Builder package manager. Stack Builder provides a graphical interface for downloading and installing applications, drivers, utilities, and their dependencies. See [Using Stack Builder](../03_using_stackbuilder) for more information.

For information about preparing to use command-line tools after installation, see [Command-line tools](#command-line-tools).

## Downloading PostgreSQL

To download PostgreSQL installers, see the [EDB downloads page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgresql). 

Rather than use the EDB installer, you can also obtain a prebuilt installation package and instructions directly from the [PostgreSQL downloads page](https://www.postgresql.org/download/).

## Installing PostgreSQL

To perform an installation using the graphical installation wizard, you need superuser or administrator privileges. 

!!! Note
    If you're using the graphical installation wizard to perform a system upgrade, the installer preserves the configuration options specified during the previous installation.

1.  To start the installation wizard, assume sufficient privileges, and double-click the installer icon. If prompted, provide a password. (In some versions of Windows, to invoke the installer with administrator privileges, you must select **Run as Administrator** from the installer icon's context menu.)

  The PostgreSQL setup wizard opens to the Welcome screen. 

  ![The PostgreSQL setup wizard welcome screen](/images/welcome.png)
  
1.  Select **Next**.

  The Installation Directory window opens. 

  ![The Installation Directory window](/images/installation_directory.png)

1.  Accept the default installation directory, or specify a location. Select **Next**.

  The Select Components window opens.

  ![Select Components](/images/select_components.png)

1.  Use options on the Select Components window to choose the software components to install. Select:

    -   **PostgreSQL Server** to install the PostgreSQL database server.
    -   **pgAdmin 4** to install pgAdmin 4. This option is available for PostgreSQL version 13.0 and later.
    -   **Stack Builder** to install the Stack Builder utility. For more information, see [Using Stack Builder](../03_using_stackbuilder).
    -   **Command Line Tools** to install PostgreSQL tools such as `psql`, `pg_isready`, `pgbench`, `clusterdb`, `createdb`, `dropdb`, `createuser`, `dropuser`, `pg_basebackup`, `pg_dump`, `pg_dumpall`, `pg_restore`, `reindexdb`, `vacuumdb`, and `vacuumlo`. This isn't a comprehensive list, and the command-line tools installed can vary by platform.

  Select **Next**.

  The Data Directory window opens. 

  ![The Data Directory window](/images/data_directory.png)

1.  Accept the default location, or specify the directory where you want to store data files. Select **Next**.

  The Password window opens.

  ![The Password window](/images/password.png)

  PostgreSQL uses the password specified on the Password window for both the database superuser and the PostgreSQL service account.

  PostgreSQL runs as a service in the background. The PostgreSQL service account is named `postgres`. If you already created a service account with the name `postgres`, you must specify the same password as the existing password for the `postgres` service account.

  The specified password must conform to any security policies on the PostgreSQL host. 
  
1.  Enter a password in the **Password** field, and confirm the password in the **Retype Password** field. Select **Next**.

  The Port window opens.

  ![The Port window](/images/the_port_dialog.png)

1.  In the **Port** field, enter the port number the server listens on. The default listener port is `5432`. Select **Next**.

  The Advanced Options window opens.

  ![The Advanced Options window](/images/aug11_ad.png)

1.  In the **Locale** field, specify the locale for the new database cluster to use. **Default locale** is the operating system locale. Select **Next**.

  The Pre Installation Summary window opens. It displays the installation preferences that you specified with the installation wizard. 

  ![The Pre Installation Summary window](/images/preinstallation.png)
  
1.  Review the settings. If necessary, use the **Back** button to return to a previous dialog box to modify a setting. When you're satisfied with the settings summary, select **Next**.

  The wizard informs you that it has the information required to install PostgreSQL. 

  ![The Ready to Install dialog box](/images/ready_to_install.png)

1.  Select **Next**.

  During the installation, the setup wizard confirms the installation progress of PostgreSQL using a series of progress bars.

  ![The Installing dialog box](/images/installing.png)

  Before the setup wizard completes the PostgreSQL installation, it offers to launch Stack Builder at exit. The Stack Builder utility provides a graphical interface that downloads and installs applications and drivers that work with PostgreSQL.

  ![The installation wizard offers to Launch Stack Builder at exit](/images/installation_complete.png)

1.  Leave the check box selected and select **Finish** to launch Stack Builder. Alternatively, clear the **Stack Builder** check box and select **Finish** to complete the PostgreSQL installation without launching Stack Builder.

## Command-line tools

By default, the installer doesn't modify the system path. If you want to use command-line tools like `psql`, you can add PostgreSQL to the path after installation. 

!!! Note
    For information about the PostgreSQL interactive terminal `psql`, see the [Postgres guide](http://postgresguide.com/utilities/psql.html).

To add PostgreSQL to the path:

1.  Open the System Properties control panel and select the **Advanced** tab. Alternatively, run `SystemPropertiesAdvanced.exe`.
2.  Select **Environment Variables** to open the environment variables editor.
3.  Select the `Path` variable under **System variables**, and select **Edit**.
4.  Add the path that you specified as the installation directory during installation, appended with `\bin`. By default, the value is `c:\program files\postgresql\15\bin`, where `15` is the version of PostgreSQL that you installed.

To test your installation, open a new command prompt and run:

```shell
psql -U postgres
```

You're prompted for the password you provided during installation.
