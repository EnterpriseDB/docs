If you encounter any problems during installation, please consult the installation logfile. The log file is created in:

-   `/tmp` on Mac OS X
-   `%TEMP%` on Windows

The installation log file is called `install-postgresql.log`. The logfile may contain the superuser password specified during the installation, which should be replaced before sharing the log with anyone.

If you are unable to resolve the problem after reviewing the logfile, please search the self-service content available at the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgres-tutorials) for a solution. If you still cannot resolve the issue, please write details of the problem, along with system details and any appropriate parts of the installation logfile to <support@enterprisedb.com>.
