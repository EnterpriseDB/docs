The PostgreSQL installer creates an uninstaller in the PostgreSQL installation directory. This section walks you through uninstalling PostgreSQL on a Windows as well as a Mac host.

## Uninstalling PostgreSQL on Windows

To uninstall PostgreSQL, navigate to the Windows `Control Panel` to open the `Uninstall or change a program` dialog and Right-click the `PostgreSQL 13` and select `Uninstall/Change` from the context menu.

## Uninstalling PostgreSQL on Mac

To uninstall PostgreSQL on a Mac system, assume the identity of an operating system superuser, and navigate into the folder in which the uninstaller resides:

`/Library/PostgreSQL/13`

Then, invoke the uninstaller with the command:

`open uninstall-postgres.app`

If prompted, provide a password that allows the uninstaller to make changes to your system. The uninstaller will open, asking you if you wish to uninstall the entire application or individual components.

To remove the entire application, select the `Entire application` option and click `Next` to start uninstalling components.

To remove individual components, select the `Individual components` option, a selection screen opens allowing you to select which components you wish to uninstall.
