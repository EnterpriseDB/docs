EDB provides a version of Postgres that is compatible with most Oracle features. This greatly simplifies migrations from Oracle by allowing many objects and application queries to work in Postgres without having to modify them. 
Additionally, EBD offers several migration tools (Migration Portal, AI Copilot, Migration Toolkit, Replication Server) that facilitate the migration of complex Oracle databases to EDB Postgres. 

For the remaining incompatibilities, EDB offers this workaround guide with practical aids for features and issues that you can't resolve automatically. It presents a collection of manual solutions to convert feature and query issues, accompanied by examples on how to address them.

Each workaround displays a summary table with the solution's key data: 

- Complexity
- Availability
- Type

## Complexity 

Specifies the complexity of the solution and the level of effort required to address the issue.

- **1 - Easy:** 
  Easy workarounds require minimal effort and are easy to implement. The compatibility with EDB Postgres is very high and the solution involves simple modifications. Performing tests to validate the solution is recommended.

- **2 - Moderate:** 
  These issues are still easily manageable and don't require a lot of background knowledge. The compatibility with EDB Postgres is high and the solution involves some modifications. Performing tests to validate the solution is recommended.

- **3 - Intermediate:** 
  The solution may require an understanding of the source Oracle database. You may need to perform troubleshooting efforts and perform comprehensive tests to validate the solution.

- **4 - Significant:** 
  Finding an equivalent for these functions requires effort, planning and a deeper understanding of Oracle and Postgres databases. The solution involves extensive modifications like using a combination of functions to reflect the original function. You will need to perform comprehensive troubleshooting efforts and end-to-end testing to validate the solution. 

- **5 - Difficult:** 
  Finding an equivalent for these functions requires effort, planning and a deeper understanding of Oracle and Postgres databases. The solution involves extensive rewrites, using a combination of multi-level functions and the original function may not be entirely equivalent, but very similar. You will need to perform comprehensive troubleshooting efforts and end-to-end testing to validate the solution. 

## Availability 

Specifies the EDB Postgres distributions for which the solution is available.

- Yes, fully convertible to EDB Postgres and EDB Postgres Advanced Server.
- No, partially convertible or no available equivalent. 

[Are there possibly solutions that will only apply to EPAS and not to PG? Do we need a category for that?]: #

## Type 

- **In Database:** 
   These workarounds are implemented directly in the database environment. They often involve modifying database objects such as tables, views, stored procedures, and triggers to ensure compatibility between Oracle and Postgres. This type of workaround handles differences in SQL syntax, data types, and database functions.

- **MP Repair Handler:** 
  MP (Migration Portal) Repair Handlers are tools or scripts developed by EDB that automate solving compatibility issues during database migrations. These handlers can detect discrepancies between Oracle and Postgres environments and apply necessary fixes or adjustments.

- **Other:**
  This category encompasses all other types of workarounds that do not fit into the In Database or MP Repair Handler classifications.
