Organizations migrate their Oracle applications to use other database technologies for a variety of reasons including:
-  Reducing costs  
-  License flexibility  
-  Open source initiatives  
-  Initiatives to modernize and consolidate applications and technologies
-  The desire to move to new platforms and deployment environments  

Due to its rich set of features, quality, and strong development community, Postgres is often chosen as the target database for a migration off of Oracle. EDB provides a distribution of PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Advanced Server, with built-in compatibility for Oracle and a set of migration tools and services specifically geared toward helping organizations move off of Oracle more easily and with less impact to their business.

The purpose of this document is to help you plan and execute an Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server migration. It identifies and describes the factors to consider when performing a migration, the steps in the migration journey, and the capabilities, tools, and services that EDB provides to help with migrations. Also covered are the key similarities and differences between Oracle and EDB Postgres Advanced Server and workarounds for known differences or incompatibilities.
