All feedback is welcome:

Is it a simple edit for a typo? Use the **Suggest Edits** button and you can make a change to the docs which we'll review before including in the next docs update.

If, on the other hand you:

1. have an idea for something new
2. you feel there's something missing
3. you can see a mistake thats more than a typo

Then Github Issues is the fastest way to get that feedback in front of us.

[Open an issue on Github &rarr;](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/docs/issues)

### Have code or content to contribute?

The only things we love more than feedback are pull requests. 

Check out [the README on Github](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/docs) to get started.
