All feedback is welcome:

1. an idea for something new
2. you feel there's something missing
3. a mistake

Github Issues is the fastest way to get that feedback in front of us.

### Have code or content to contribute?

The only things we love more than feedback are pull requests. Check out [the README on Github](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/docs) to get started.
