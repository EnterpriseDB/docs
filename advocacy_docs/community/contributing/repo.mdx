Below are detailed steps to get started with [this repository](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/docs). Instructions are optimized for macOS.

> **Note**: Items in code blocks indicate the Terminal command you should input; Terminal is a program that comes standard on MacOS. 

Example:

  ```shell
  echo "hi!"
  __OUTPUT__
  hi!
  ```

## How to Install an IDE, Git, and Homebrew
1. Download VS Code from https://code.visualstudio.com/download (Skip this step if you already have an IDE or favorite editor)
2. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)   
    Go to your Mac Terminal and enter the following command  
    ```shell
    /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
    ```  
    This will take a few minutes
3. Install [git](https://git-scm.com/) from Terminal  
    ```shell
    brew install git
    ```

## How to Install the Repository and dependencies
4. Clone the docs repo into your local environment  
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/docs.git
    ```
5. Add the new repository folder to VS Code  
    Go to VS Code > File menu > Add Folder to Workspace > browse to “docs”  
    Click on > docs to expand it within VS Code
6. Install Node.js 12 or higher from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
7. Go to the docs directory in Terminal   
    ```shell
    cd docs
    ```
8. Install node    
    ```shell
    brew install node
    ```
9. Install python  
    ```shell
    brew install python
    ```
10. Install yarn and gatsby  
    ```shell
    npm i -g gatsby-cli
    npm i -g yarn
    ```
11. Install required packages with yarn   
    ```shell
    yarn
    ```
12. Select sources with yarn  
    ```shell
    yarn config-sources
    ```
    You'll be prompted to choose the packages you'd like to access; you can use comma separated values to choose more than one  
    ```shell
    yarn develop
    ```
13. Go to the localhost port in your browser, e.g. http://localhost:8000/ (your url will be mentioned in Terminal)

### Tips to Use Terminal
- <kbd>⌘</kbd>+<kbd>T</kbd> (press the command key and T key together) opens a new tab - use this to execute terminal commands while <code>yarn develop</code> is running
- <kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> closes a process - use this to return to the terminal prompt after you're done testing with <code>yarn develop</code>

## How to Make changes and Submit Pull Requests
You'll make edits and additions via your IDE (VS Code). We recommend using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) unless you're familiar with git.  

14. Get in the habit of pulling the latest changes from the `develop` branch of the Github repository on a regular basis, so that you don't have to manually merge your changes with those made by others. Use the "Fetch origin" and "Pull origin" buttons in Github Desktop at the start of your work day to update your local files with those from the server. You should also do this again before submitting a pull request. For details, see: [Syncing your branch
](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/contributing-and-collaborating-using-github-desktop/syncing-your-branch)

15. To submit a pull request
    - Make changes to the repository in VS code (or your IDE of choice)
    - Save changes (<kbd>CTRL</kbd>+<kbd>S</kbd> in VS Code)
    - Create a new branch and name it in Github Desktop
    - Follow remaining steps in Github Desktop, most likely starting with "Commit to branch-name"
