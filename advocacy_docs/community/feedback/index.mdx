All feedback is welcome. Here are some common reasons people reach out:

1. you have an idea for something new
2. you feel there's something missing
3. you found a mistake

### Use Github issues

The fastest way to get your feedback in front of us is to [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/rocketinsights/edb_docs_advocacy/).

### Have code or content to contribute?

The only thing we love more than Github issues are Github pull requests. We get it, not everyone has the time or the inclination to pull one of those together. Just sayin... we love 'em. 

If you are _are_ so inclined, great! Check out our [contribution guidelines](/community/contribute).
