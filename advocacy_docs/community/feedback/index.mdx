The fastest way to get your feedback in front of us is to [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/rocketinsights/edb_docs_advocacy/). 

All feedback is welcome:

1. you have an idea for something new
2. you feel there's something missing
3. you found a mistake

### Have code or content to contribute?

The only thing we love more than Github issues are Github pull requests. If you have one to share, great! Before you do, please review our [contribution guidelines](/community/contribute).
