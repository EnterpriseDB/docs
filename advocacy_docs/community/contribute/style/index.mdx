Every article here starts with a block of [Frontmatter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/adding-markdown-pages/#frontmatter-for-metadata-in-markdown-files) metadata (YAML format):

```yaml
---
title: The full title of the article
navTitle: (optional) 1-2 word title for the navigation sidebar
description: (optional) summary description for links on the index page
product: (optional) product the article is about (ex. postgres-advanced-server)
platform: (optional) the platform which the article is about (ex. ubuntu)
tags: list of relevant keywords (used for related articles) Ex.
    - postgresql
    - ubuntu
    - psql
    - live-demo
---

```

Below the Frontmatter's closing dashes is the MDX (Markdown) formatted text of the article. MDX is based on [CommonMark](https://github.com/mdx-js/specification), which minimizes distracting markup - but JSX components or raw HTML may also be mixed in where needed:

```markdown
## Introduction

Briefly introduce the purpose of the article.
Level 2 headings (##) will be linked in the table of contents
generated automatically for the page.

## Step 1

Get into the *actual* information.

### Subsection

Break up long runs of text into subsections.
Level 3 headings (###) will *not* appear in the table of contents.

## Demo

MDX allows including and referencing React components
as well, which is handy for things like Katacoda embeds:

import Katacoda from '../../../../src/advocacy_components/katacoda';

<Katacoda
 account="enterprisedb" scenario="sandbox"
 clickToShowText="Use psql on the Pagila database"
 panel="true"/>
```

## A note on search engines

Readers may find your article from a search engine. If your article is split into separate pages, keep in mind that readers may view the pages out of order. It might be useful to alert them to important details that previous pages cover. To do so, we recommend using the `<Attention>` component at the top of your article where prior context would be useful:

```markdown
<Attention>Don't forget to [install prerequisite](/link/article) before trying to connect!</Attention>
```
