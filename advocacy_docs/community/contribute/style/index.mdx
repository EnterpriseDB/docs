Every article here starts with a block of [Frontmatter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/adding-markdown-pages/#frontmatter-for-metadata-in-markdown-files) metadata (YAML format):

```yaml
---
title: The full title of the article
navTitle: (optional) 1-2 word title for the navigation sidebar 
description: (optional) summary description for links on the index page
product: (optional) product the article is about (ex. postgres-advanced-server) 
platform: (optional) the platform which the article is about (ex. ubuntu) 
tags: list of relevant keywords (used for related articles) Ex.
    - postgresql
    - ubuntu
    - psql
    - live-demo
katacodaPages: (optional) list of Katacoda scenarios linked in the page
    - scenario: install-ubuntu
      account: enterprisedb
---

```

Below the Frontmatter's closing dashes is the MDX (Markdown) formatted text of the article. MDX is based on [CommonMark](https://github.com/mdx-js/specification), which minimizes distracting markup - but JSX components or raw HTML may also be mixed in where needed:

```markdown
## Introduction

Briefly introduce the purpose of the article. 
Level 2 headings (##) will be linked in the table of contents 
generated automatically for the page.

## Step 1

Get into the *actual* information.

### Subsection

Break up long runs of text into subsections. 
Level 3 headings (###) will *not* appear 
in the table of contents.

## Demo

MDX allows including and referencing React components 
as well, which is handy for things like Katacoda embeds:

<!-- button to launch a terminal panel at the bottom of the page 
    and make SQL code blocks executable in it -->
<KatacodaPanel account="enterprisedb" 
    scenario="sandbox"
    codeLanguages="sql" />
<!-- this will create a link to the scenario described in 
    the Frontmatter at the top of this article -->
<KatacodaPageLink scenario="install-ubuntu" />
```
