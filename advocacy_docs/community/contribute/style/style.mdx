This is a small collection of tips aimed at helping you to write effectively; use what you find helpful, and ignore what you don't.

## Start with your own voice

You're drawing from your own knowledge and experience when writing, so start by writing in your own words. You've probably explained the topic you're writing about to others before, so draw on that experience: what worked, and what did not. 

You will want to go back later and revise what you've written before submitting it, but initially the only person reading it is you - so make sure that at least *you* can understand what you've written!

## Be prescriptive instead of descriptive

Readers have work to get done, and need information on how to do it. When there are multiple options, they must spend time and energy trying to decide which option to take - the easier we make this for them, the more useful these articles become. So whenever possible, indicate both the preferred course of action and when / why other options might be relevant. **It is ok to be opinionated!** Empower readers to make their own decisions, but don't pretend all options are equally valid; if one approach will be best in most situations, *say that!*

### Avoid awkward passive phrasing

Most of us have spent a great deal of time reading existing reference documentation, and too often we mirror its style - even when we're not writing reference documentation. Reference docs strive to reflect facts and avoid opinions, even when those opinions are well-supported by facts - this can lead to stilted, hard-to-understand sentences. 

When something you've written appears awkward upon review, pretend that you're writing for a colleague whose work will affect your own: you may quickly find a more direct way to communicate.

## Prefer gender-neutral language

Most of the subjects we're writing about here have no gender, so this is usually pretty easy. Should you find it useful to include an example involving *people*, then prefer to use "they/them/their" as pronouns unless your example includes *real* people *and* you happen to know their genders.
