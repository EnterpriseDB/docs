Note: per [Github convention](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors), this content may move this project to a CONTRIBUTING.md file in this project's root directory.

Before we dive into the details, let us first say...

## Thanks for contributing!

It takes a village, as they say. We appreciate everyone's effort and time to help us make this documentation project the best that it can be, for people new to PostgreSQL, EDB customers, the good people who support those customers, and anyone else who uses PostgreSQL in anger and with love.

## How can I contribute?

There are lots of ways to contribute, and all of them involve Github. We love Github. Keep reading.

### Report bugs

There are two ways to report bugs. One is faster than the other, but both are great:

1. faster: click the "Edit this page" link at the top of every page. This link will take you to Github, where you can edit the file (they're all Markdown files) and issue a pull request, which will alert us to your change. If we agree it's a fix, we'll merge it in.
2. slower: go to the Issues page of this Github repository, and start an issue.

### Share ideas

The best way to share ideas for how we can improve EDB Docs is to use Github Issues.

### Make a pull request

Like with bugs, there are 2 ways to make pull requests:

1. click the "Edit this page" button at the top of any page of EDB Docs (including this one). This is great for simple text fixes.
2. use git or Github Desktop to pull down this site's files using git, make a branch, edit files, push them back up to Github, and make a pull request. This is the right approach for more substantive contributions, like new site pages or sections.
