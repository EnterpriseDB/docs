*Note: per [Github convention](https://help.github.com/en/github/building-a-strong-community/setting-guidelines-for-repository-contributors), this content may move this project to a CONTRIBUTING.md file in this project's root directory.*

Got information that'd useful as a part of these docs? A link that's relevant to a topic here? An idea for a demo? Spot something that could be improved? We welcome all contributors!

## Thanks for contributing!

It's folks like you, working together, that make PostgreSQL such a great community to be a part of. We appreciate everyone's effort and time to help us make this documentation project the best that it can be, for people new to PostgreSQL, EDB customers, the good people who support those customers, and anyone else who uses PostgreSQL in anger and with love.

## How can I contribute?

There are lots of ways to contribute, and all of them involve Github. We love Github. Keep reading.

### Fixing problems

Spot a typo? A bug in a code sample? Awkward or misleading phrasing? Submit a correction!

1. Click the "Edit this page" link at the top-right of the page where you spotted the problem. This will take you to GitHub (you may need to log in first).
2. Click the "Fork this project" button to create your own working copy of the docs. GitHub will open the relevant [MDX file](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/mdx/writing-pages/) for editing.
3. Make whatever corrections you see fit, then describe the reason for the changes in the text fields at the bottom of the page.
4. Click "Propose changes" - GitHub create a branch containing your change and show you a diff. At this point you can make further changes in your patch branch, or - if the changes are sufficient - submit a pull request for us to review.
5. Click "Create pull request" - GitHub will give you another chance to describe the reason for your changes; once you're satisfied, click "Create pull request" again.
6. We'll be notified of the pull request - if we have any questions or concerns, we'll comment on it, when it looks good we'll merge it in and build out the changes!

### Report bugs

See a problem, but not sure how it should be fixed? [Create an Issue on GitHub!](/community/feedback)

### Share ideas

The best way to share ideas for how we can improve EDB Docs is to use [Github Issues](/community/feedback). Please be open to discussion - the best ideas come from collaboration!

### Suggest additions

Got an idea for a new topic, or a better way of presenting an existing one? As with bugs, the fastest way to add to these pages is to make a pull request. You can use the "Edit this page" option (described above) or use git or Github Desktop to fork the repository, clone it to your local machine, make a branch, edit files, push them back up to Github, and make a pull request. For more extensive changes (new pages or sections), working locally allows you to build the site and preview your work before submitting it - you can even open the repository directly from VSCode, and run it in a container without installing anything locally!
