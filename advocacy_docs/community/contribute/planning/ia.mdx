description: How the site is organized, and where to put things like new products

The site has two main organizing concepts:

- "advocacy docs," which generally guides a user on their journey with PostgreSQL, from getting started to production
- "product docs," which describe the products we support, some of which we also build ourselves

## Advocacy docs

This is content that we believe is useful to people working with PostgreSQL, and doesn't directly tie to any of our proprietary software, or software versions. Here, we help people who work with adjacent technologies.

## Product docs

### Proprietary software 

Stuff we make that is either closed source or value add on top of open source

### Open source projects

Software that we support but do not change

### FAQs

#### How do I add a product?

Where do I put it in the file system? Decision tree...

#### How do I help people find it?

Where do I add links to it? Decision tree...

#### What if I have a tutorial that features more than one product we support? 

Under which product does that tutorial go?  Decision tree...

1. tutorials _live_ in the area where they major; i.e., barman/tutorials
2. while tutorials live where they major, we still need to reference them from a "tutorials" landing page, which will link to all of the tutorials on the site 
2. not only do we need to link from a tutorials landing page to all tutorials across the site, but we also need to link from a tutorial where it _lives_ out to the tutorials Index; there's a new contextual link from the tutorial pages under any given focus area (i.e., barman/tutorials) that not only shows the tutorials that live in that section, but also generically links out to the main tutorials Index
