This demo is in two parts:

1. Intro
2. Live demo

The intro will highlight the front end, which features both advocacy and product content in one UX, source control and collaboration via git and Github, and working locally with the content and the app.

The live demo will further develop working locally. Josh will walk through the steps to convert an existing, static tutorial to an interactive one, featuring a Katacoda "panel" embed.
