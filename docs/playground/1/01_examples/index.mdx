Here are some of the most common things you'll need to use for content. For a full list, go to this [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Fair warning: not all of those examples will work here.

## Text styling

```
Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or __underscores__.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.
```

becomes

Emphasis, aka italics, with _asterisks_ or _underscores_.

Strong emphasis, aka bold, with **asterisks** or **underscores**.

Combined emphasis with **asterisks and _underscores_**.

## Headers

Headers are what create the bigger, bolder text right above this sentence. These break out sections and get used on the right side as part of the page's Table of Contents.

Here's the format:
`## Header name`

That is for an h2 `html` element. For different headers, use more `#` signs.

`### h3 header name`

which makes

### h3 header name

The `h3` is slightly smaller and still creates an anchor tag, but it does not get used in the page's Table of Contents.

## Lists

(In this example, leading and trailing spaces are shown with with dots: ⋅)

```
1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list.
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

⋅⋅⋅You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line
 above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align
  the raw Markdown).

⋅⋅⋅To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅(This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces
 are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
```

## Code and Syntax Highlighting

```
Inline `code` has `back-ticks around` it.

Blocks of code are fenced by lines with three back-ticks ```

````
```
Here we can use html tags like this <b>bold</b> or <em>em</em>that won't do anything.

## Links

```
[I'm an inline-style link](https://www.google.com)

[I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.google.com "Google's Homepage")

[I'm an inline link to an anchor in the same document](#headers)

[I'm an inline link to another page in the same site](link)

[I'm a reference-style link][Arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]

[You can use numbers for reference-style link definitions][1]

Or leave it empty and use the [link text itself].

URLs and URLs in angle brackets will automatically get turned into links.
http://www.example.com or <http://www.example.com> and sometimes
example.com (but not on Github, for example).

Some text to show that the reference links can follow later.

[arbitrary case-insensitive reference text]: https://www.mozilla.org
[1]: http://slashdot.org
[link text itself]: http://www.reddit.com
```
