title: Using a Package Manager to Install Advanced Server
---


You can use the yum package manager to install Advanced Server or Advanced Server supporting components. yum will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but requires access to the Advanced Server repositories. If your system does not have access to a repository via the Internet, you can use RPM to install a package or create a local repository, but you may be required to manually satisfy package dependencies.

The Advanced Server RPM installs Advanced Server and the core components of the database server. For a complete list of the RPM installers available for Advanced Server and its supporting components, see Section <span class="underline">3.1.</span>

Installing the server package creates a database superuser named enterprisedb. The user is assigned a user ID (UID) and a group ID (GID) of 26. The user has no default password; use the passwd command to assign a password for the user. The default shell for the user is bash, and the user's home directory is /var/lib/edb/as10.

By default, Advanced Server logging is configured to write files to the log subdirectory of the data directory, rotating the files each day and retaining one week of log entries. You can customize the logging behavior of the server by modifying the postgresql.conf file; for more information about modifying the postgresql.conf file, please see Section <span class="underline">6.1</span>.

The RPM installers place Advanced Server components in the directories listed in the table below:

| Component                         | Location                                 |

## Installing an RPM Package

Before installing the Advanced Server or a supporting component via an RPM package, you must request access to the EnterpriseDB repository. For more information, visit:

<https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf>

After receiving your repository credentials you can:

1\. Create the repository configuration file.

2\. Modify the file, providing your user name and password.

3\. Install Advanced Server and its supporting components.

**Creating a Repository Configuration File and Installing Advanced Server**

To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

> yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm

The repository configuration file is named edb.repo. The file resides in /etc/yum.repos.d.

After creating the edb.repo file, use your choice of editor to ensure that the value of the enabled parameter is 1, and replace the username and password placeholders in the baseurl specification with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

\[edb\]

name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch

baseurl=https://\<*username\>*:\<*password\>*@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch

enabled=1

gpgcheck=1

gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY

After saving your changes to the configuration file, you can use yum install command to install Advanced Server. For example, to install the server and its core components, use the command:

> yum install edb-as10-server

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter a y, and press Return to continue.

After installing Advanced Server, you must configure the installation; see Section <span class="underline">3.3</span>, *Configuring a Package Installation*, for details.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

### Advanced Server RPM Installers

The tables that follow list the packages that are available from EnterpriseDB. Please note that you can also use the yum search command to access a list of the packages that are currently available from your configured repository. To use the yum search command, open a command line, assume root privileges, and enter:

yum search *package*

Where *package* is the search term that specifies the name (or partial name) of a package. The repository search will return a list of available packages that include the specified search term.

The following table lists the packages that are stored in the Advanced Server repository and the corresponding software installed by those packages:

Please Note: Available packages are subject to change.

## Updating an RPM Installation

If you have an existing Advanced Server RPM installation, you can use yum to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the edb.repo file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

> yum upgrade edb-repo

yum will update the edb.repo file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your edb.repo file. Then, you can use yum to upgrade all packages whose names include the expression edb:

> yum upgrade *edb\**

Please note that the yum upgrade command will only perform an update between minor releases; to update between major releases, you must use pg\_upgrade.

For more information about using yum commands and options, enter yum --help on your command line, or visit:

<https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Deployment_Guide/ch-yum.html>

## Configuring a Package Installation

The packages that install the database server component create a service configuration file (on version 6.x hosts) or unit file (on version 7.x hosts), and service startup scripts.

The PostgreSQL initdb command creates a database cluster. If you are using an RPM package to install Advanced Server, you must manually configure the service and invoke initdb to create your cluster.

When invoking initdb, you can:
 - Specify environment options on the command line.
 - Include the service command on RHEL or CentOS 6.x, and use service configuration file to configure the environment.
 - Include the systemd service manager on RHEL or CentOS 7.x use the service configuration file to configure the environment.

If you are using the interactive graphical installer to install Advanced Server, the installer will invoke initdb to create a cluster for you; for details about specifying cluster preferences when using the interactive installer, see ***Setting Cluster Preferences with the Graphical Installer*** in Chapter <span class="underline">4</span>.

### Creating a Database Cluster and Starting the Service

After specifying any options in the service configuration file, you must create the database cluster and start the service; these steps are platform specific.

***On RHEL or CentOS 6.x***

To create a database cluster in the PGDATA directory that listens on the port specified by the PGPORT specified in the service configuration file described in Section <span class="underline">3.3.2</span>, assume root privileges, and invoke the service script:

> service edb-as-10 initdb

You can also assign a locale to the cluster when invoking initdb. By default, initdb will use the value specified by the $LANG operating system variable, but if you append a preferred locale when invoking the script, the cluster will use the alternate value. For example, to create a database cluster that uses simplified Chinese, invoke the command:

> service edb-as-10 initdb zh\_CH.UTF-8

After creating a database cluster, start the database server with the command:

> service edb-as-10 start

***On RHEL or CentOS 7.x***

To invoke initdb on a RHEL or CentOS 7.x system, with the options specified in the service configuration file, assume the identity of the operating system superuser:

> su - root

Then, invoke initdb:

> /usr/edb/as10/bin/edb-as-10-setup initdb

After creating the cluster, use systemctl to start, stop, or restart the service:

> systemctl { start | stop | restart } edb-as-10

For more information about using the service command, please see Section <span class="underline">5.2.</span>

### Using a Service Configuration File on CentOS or Redhat 6.x

On a CentOS or RedHat version 6.x host, the RPM installer creates a service configuration file named edb-as-10.sysconfig in /etc/sysconfig/edb/as10. Please note that options specified in the service configuration file are only enforced if initdb is invoked via the service command; if you manually invoke initdb (at the command line), you must specify the other options (such as the location of the data directory and installation mode) on the command line.

!\[image\]\(./images/image3.png)

*Figure 3.5 -The Advanced Server service configuration file.*

The file contains the following environment variables:
 - PGENGINE specifies the location of the engine and utility executable files.
 - PGPORT specifies the listener port for the database server.
 - PGDATA specifies the path to the data directory.
 - PGLOG specifies the location of the log file to which the server writes startup information.
 - Use INITDBOPTS to specify any initdb option or options that you wish to apply to the new cluster.

You can modify the edb-as-10.sysconfig file before using the service command to invoke the startup script to change the listener port, data directory location, startup log location or installation mode. If you plan to create more than one instance on the same system, you may wish to copy the edb-as-10.sysconfig file (and the associated edb-as-10 startup script) and modify the file contents for each additional instance that resides on the same host.

#### Specifying INITDBOPTS Options

You can use the INITDBOPTS variable to specify your cluster configuration preferences. By default, the INITDBOPTS variable is commented out in the service configuration file; unless modified, when you run the service startup script, the new cluster will be created in a mode compatible with Oracle databases. Clusters created in this mode will contain a database named edb, and have a database superuser named enterprisedb.

To create a new cluster in PostgreSQL mode, remove the pound sign (\#) in front of the INITDBOPTS variable, enabling the "--no-redwood-compat" option. Clusters created in PostgreSQL mode will contain a database named postgres, and have a database superuser named postgres.

You may also specify multiple initdb options. For example, the following statement:

INITDBOPTS="--no-redwood-compat -U alice --locale=en\_US.UTF-8"

Creates a database cluster (without compatibility features for Oracle) that contains a database named postgres that is owned by a user named alice; the cluster uses UTF-8 encoding.

In addition to the cluster configuration options documented in the PostgreSQL core documentation, Advanced Server supports the following initdb options:

\--no-redwood-compat

Include the --no-redwood-compat keywords to instruct the server to create the cluster in PostgreSQL mode. When the cluster is created in PostgreSQL mode, the name of the database superuser will be postgres, the name of the default database will be postgres, and Advanced Server’s features compatible with Oracle databases will not be available to the cluster.

\--redwood-like

Include the --redwood-like keywords to instruct the server to use an escape character (an empty string ('')) following the LIKE (or PostgreSQL-compatible ILIKE) operator in a SQL statement that is compatible with Oracle syntax.

\--icu-short-form

Include the --icu-short-form keywords to create a cluster that uses a default ICU (International Components for Unicode) collation for all databases in the cluster. For more information about Unicode collations, please refer to the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server Guide* available at:

<http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/products/documentation>

For more information about using initdb, and the available cluster configuration options, see the PostgreSQL Core Documentation available at:

[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/app-initdb.html](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/app-initdb.html)

You can also view online help for initdb by assuming superuser privileges and entering:

/*path\_to\_initdb\_installation\_directory*/initdb --help

Where *path\_to\_initdb\_installation\_directory* specifies the location of the initdb binary file.

### Modifying the Data Directory Location on CentOS or Redhat 7.x

On a CentOS or RedHat version 7.x host, the unit file is named edb-as-10.service and resides in /usr/lib/systemd/system. The unit file contains references to the location of the Advanced Server data directory. You should avoid making any modifications directly to the unit file because it may be overwritten during package upgrades.

By default, data files reside under /var/lib/edb/as10/data directory. To use a data directory that resides in a non-default location, create a copy of the unit file under the /etc directory:

> cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-10.service
> /etc/systemd/system/

After copying the unit file to the new location, modify the service file (/etc/systemd/system/edb-as-10.service) with your editor of choice, correcting any required paths.

Then, use the following command to reload systemd, updating the modified service scripts:

> systemctl daemon-reload

Then, start the Advanced Server service with the following command:

> systemctl start edb-as-10

## Starting Multiple Postmasters with Different Clusters

You can configure Advanced Server to use multiple postmasters, each with its own database cluster. The steps required are version specific to the Linux host.

***On RHEL or CentOS 6.x***

The edb-as10-server-core RPM contains a script that starts the Advanced Server instance. The script can be copied, allowing you to run multiple services, with unique data directories and that monitor different ports. You must have root access to invoke or modify the script.

The example that follows creates a second instance on an Advanced Server host; the secondary instance is named secondary:

1.  Create a hard link in /etc/rc.d/init.d (or equivalent location) to edb-as-10 named secondary-edb-as-10:

> ln edb-as-10 secondary-edb-as-10

Be sure to pick a name that is not already used in /etc/rc.d/init.d.

2.  Create a file in /etc/sysconfig/edb/as10/ named secondary-edb-as-10. This file is where you would typically define PGDATA and PGOPTS. Since $PGDATA/postgresql.conf will override many of these settings (except PGDATA) you might notice unexpected results on startup.

3.  Create the target PGDATA directory.

4.  Assume the identity of the Advanced Server database superuser (enterprisedb) and invoke initdb on the target PGDATA. For information about using initdb, please see the PostgreSQL Core Documentation available at:

[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/app-initdb.html](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/app-initdb.html)

5.  Edit the postgresql.conf file to specify the port, address, TCP/IP settings, etc. for the secondary instance.

6.  Start the postmaster with the following command:

> service secondary-edb-as-10 start

***On RHEL or CentOS 7.x***

The edb-as10-server-core RPM for version 7.x contains a unit file that starts the Advanced Server instance. The file allows you to start multiple services, with unique data directories and that monitor different ports. You must have root access to invoke or modify the script.

The example that follows creates an Advanced Server installation with two instances; the secondary instance is named secondary:

1.  Make a copy of the default file with the new name. As noted at the top of the file, all modifications must reside under /etc. You must pick a name that is not already used in /etc/systemd/system.

> cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-10.service /etc/systemd/system/secondary-edb-as-10.service

2.  Edit the file, changing PGDATA to point to the new data directory that you will create the cluster against.

3.  Create the target PGDATA with user enterprisedb.

4.  Run initdb, specifying the setup script:

/usr/edb/as10/bin/edb-as-10-setup initdb secondary-edb-as-10

5.  Edit the postgresql.conf file for the new instance, specifying the port, the IP address, TCP/IP settings, etc.

6.  Make sure that new cluster runs after a reboot:

> systemctl enable secondary-edb-as-10

7.  Start the second cluster with the following command:

> systemctl start secondary-edb-as-10

## Installing Advanced Server on an Isolated Network

You can create a local yum repository to act as a host for the Advanced Server RPM packages if the server on which you wish to install Advanced Server (or supporting components) cannot directly access the EnterpriseDB repository. Please note that this is a high-level listing of the steps requires; you will need to modify the process for your individual network.

To create and use a local repository, you must:

1.  Use yum to install the yum-utils and createrepo packages:

> yum install yum-utils
> yum install createrepo

2.  Create a directory in which to store the repository:

> mkdir /srv/repos

3.  Copy the RPM installation packages to your local network repository. You can download the individual RPM files from:

> [yum.enterprisedb.com](yum.enterprisedb.com)

4.  Sync the RPM packages and create the repository.

> reposync -r edbas10 -p /srv/repos
> createrepo /srv/repos

5.  Install your preferred webserver on the host that will act as your local repository, and ensure that the repository directory is accessible to the other servers on your network. For example, you might install lighttpd:

> yum install lighttpd

6.  If you are using lighttpd, you must provide a configuration file that identifies the location of the repository on your local network. For example, the configuration file might contain:

> $HTTP\["host"\] == "yum.domain.com"{
> server.document-root = "/srv/repos"
> server.errorlog="/var/log/lighttpd/yum\_error.log"
> accesslog.filename = "/var/log/lighttpd/yum\_access.log"}
>
> For detailed information about installing, configuring and using lighttpd, visit the official project site at:

<http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/1/wiki/Docs>

7.  On each isolated database server, configure yum to pull updates from the mirrored repository on your local network. For example, you might create a file called /etc/yum.repos.d/edb-repo with connection information that specifies:

> \[edbas10\]
> name=EnterpriseDB Advanced Server 10
> baseurl=http://yum.domain.com/edbas10
> enabled=1
> gpgcheck=0

After specifying the location and connection information for your local repository, you can use yum commands to install Advanced Server and its supporting components on the isolated servers. For example:

> yum install edb-as10
