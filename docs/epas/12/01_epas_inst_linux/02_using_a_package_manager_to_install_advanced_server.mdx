title: "Using a Package Manager to Install Advanced Server"
---

<div id="using_a_package_manager_to_install_advanced_server" class="registered_link"></div>


You can use the yum package manager to install Advanced Server or Advanced Server supporting components. yum will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but requires access to the Advanced Server repositories. If your system does not have access to a repository via the Internet, you can use RPM to install an individual package or create a local repository, but you may be required to manually satisfy package dependencies.

Installing the server package creates a database superuser named `enterprisedb`. The user is assigned a user ID (UID) and a group ID (GID) of `26`. The user has no default password; use the `passwd` command to assign a password for the user. The default shell for the user is `bash`, and the user's home directory is `/var/lib/edb/as12`.

By default, Advanced Server logging is configured to write files to the `log` subdirectory of the `data` directory, rotating the files each day and retaining one week of log entries. You can customize the logging behavior of the server by [modifying the postgresql.conf File](04_managing_an_advanced_server_installation#modifying_the_postgresqlconf_file).

The RPM installers place Advanced Server components in the directories listed in the table below:

| Component                         | Location                                   |

## Installing Advanced Server on a Linux Host

Before using an RPM package to install Advanced Server on a Linux host, you must:

**Install Linux-specific Software**

You must install `xterm, konsole`, or `gnome-terminal` before executing any console-based program installed by EnterpriseDB installers.

**Install Migration Toolkit or EDB*Plus Installation Prerequisites (Optional)**

Before using an RPM to install Migration Toolkit or EDB*Plus, you must first install Java version 1.7 or later for Migration Toolkit and Java version 1.8 or later for EDB*Plus. On a Linux system, you can use the yum package manager to install Java. Open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

> `# yum install java`

Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation.

**Request Credentials to the EnterpriseDB Repository**

You must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

<https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf>.

After receiving your repository credentials you can:

1.  Create the repository configuration file.
2.  Modify the file, providing your user name and password.
3.  Install the repository keys and additional prerequisite software.
4.  Install Advanced Server and supporting components.

### Creating a Repository Configuration File and Installing Advanced Server

To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

> `yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm`

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d.`

After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to set the value of the `enabled` parameter to `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

``` text
[edb]
name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=https://<\ *username>*:<*password>*\ @yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```

After saving your changes to the configuration file, you must download and install the repository keys:

1.  Use the following command to download the repository key:
    
    `curl -o /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY https://yum.enterprisedb.com/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY`

2.  Use the following command to install the key:
    
    `rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY`

3.  Use the following commands to install the prerequisite software:
    
    `# yum -y install epel-release`
    
    `# yum makecache`

Then, you can use `yum install` command to install Advanced Server. For example, to install the server and its core components, use the command:

> `yum install edb-as12-server`

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system,`yum` may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter a `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

After installing Advanced Server, you must configure the installation. For more information, see [Configuring a Package Installation](02_using_a_package_manager_to_install_advanced_server#configuring_a_package_installation).

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

### Advanced Server RPM Packages

The tables that follow list the RPM packages that are available from EnterpriseDB. You can also use the yum search command to access a list of the packages that are currently available from your configured repository. Open a command line, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

`yum search <package>`

Where `package` is the search term that specifies the name (or partial name) of a package.

Please note: The available package list is subject to change.

### Updating an RPM Installation

If you have an existing Advanced Server RPM installation, you can use yum to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the `edb.repo` file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

> `yum upgrade edb-repo`

yum will update the `edb.repo` file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your `edb.repo` file. Then, you can use yum to upgrade all packages whose names include the expression edb:

> `yum upgrade edb*`

Please note that the `yum upgrade` command will only perform an update between minor releases; to update between major releases, you must use pg_upgrade.

For more information about using yum commands and options, enter `yum --help` on your command line, or visit:

<https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Deployment_Guide/ch-yum.html>

## Installing Advanced Server on a Debian or Ubuntu Host

To install Advanced Server on a Debian or Ubuntu host, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, visit:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request>

The following steps will walk you through using the EnterpriseDB apt repository to install a debian package. When using the commands, replace the `username` and `password` with the credentials provided by EnterpriseDB.

1.  Assume superuser privileges:
    
    `sudo su –`

2.  Configure the EnterpriseDB repository:
    
    `sh -c 'echo "deb https://\ <username>:<password>\ @apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'`

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:
    
    `apt-get install apt-transport-https`

4.  Add the EBD signing key:
    
    `wget -q -O - https://\ <username>:<password> @apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key \| apt-key add -`

5.  Update the repository metadata:
    
    `apt-get update`

6.  Install Debian package:
    
    `apt-get install edb-as12`

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

Some Advanced Server components require a Java installation. Before using a native package to add Migration Toolkit to your system, please ensure that Java version 7 is installed on your Advanced Server host. Before using a native package to install EDB*Plus, please ensure that Java version 8 or later is installed.

</div>

If you are installing an Advanced Server supporting component that requires Java (such as MTK or EDB*Plus), make sure that you install Java version 8 before installing the supporting components.

The Debian package manager places Advanced Server and supporting components in the directories listed in the following table:

## Configuring a Package Installation

The packages that install the database server component create a service configuration file (on version 6.x hosts) or unit file (on version 7.x hosts), and service startup scripts.

### Creating a Database Cluster and Starting the Service

The PostgreSQL `initdb` command creates a database cluster; when installing Advanced Server with an RPM package, the `initdb` executable is in `/usr/edb/asx.x/bin`. After installing Advanced Server, you must manually configure the service and invoke `initdb` to create your cluster. When invoking `initdb`, you can:

  - Specify environment options on the command line.
  - Include the `service` command on RHEL or CentOS 6.x and use a service configuration file to configure the environment.
  - Include the `systemd` service manager on RHEL or CentOS 7.x and use a service configuration file to configure the environment.

To review the `initdb` documentation, visit:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/app-initdb.html>

After specifying any options in the service configuration file, you can create the database cluster and start the service; these steps are platform specific.

**On RHEL or CentOS 6.x**

To create a database cluster in the `PGDATA` directory that listens on the port specified by the `PGPORT` environment variable specified in the service configuration file (described in [Using a Service Configuration File on CentOS or Redhat 6.x](02_using_a_package_manager_to_install_advanced_server#using_a_service_configuration_file_on_centos_or_redhat_6x)), assume `root` privileges, and invoke the `service` script:

> `service edb-as-12 initdb`

You can also assign a locale to the cluster when invoking `initdb`. By default, `initdb` will use the value specified by the $LANG operating system variable, but if you append a preferred locale when invoking the script, the cluster will use the alternate value. For example, to create a database cluster that uses simplified Chinese, invoke the command:

> `service edb-as-12 initdb zh_CH.UTF-8`

After creating a database cluster, start the database server with the command:

> `service edb-as-12 start`

**On RHEL or CentOS 7.x**

To invoke `initdb` on a RHEL or CentOS 7.x system, with the options specified in the service configuration file, assume the identity of the operating system superuser:

> `su - root`

To initialize a cluster with the non-default values, you can use the `PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS` environment variable by invoking the `edb-as-12-setup` cluster initialization script that resides under `EPAS_Home/bin`.

To invoke `initdb` export the `PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS` environment variable with the following command:

> `PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS="-E UTF-8" /usr/edb/as12/bin/edb-as-12-setup initdb`

After creating the cluster, use `systemctl` to start, stop, or restart the service:

> `systemctl { start \| stop \| restart } edb-as-12`

**On Debian 9x or Ubuntu 18.04**

You can initialize multiple clusters using the bundled scripts. To create a new cluster, assume `root` privileges, and invoke the bundled script:

>  `/usr/bin/epas_createcluster 12 main2`

To start a new cluster, use the following command:

> `/usr/bin/epas_ctlcluster 12 main2 start`    

To list all the available clusters, use the following command:

> `/usr/bin/epas_lsclusters`

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

The data directory is created under `/var/lib/edb-as/12/main2` and configuration directory is created under `/etc/edb-as/12/main/`.

</div>

<div id="using_a_service_configuration_file_on_centos_or_redhat_6x" class="registered_link"></div>

### Using a Service Configuration File on CentOS or Redhat 6.x

On a CentOS or RedHat version 6.x host, the RPM installer creates a service configuration file named `edb-as-12.sysconfig` in `/etc/sysconfig/edb/as12` (see Figure 4.1). Please note that options specified in the service configuration file are only enforced if `initdb` is invoked via the service command; if you manually invoke `initdb` (at the command line), you must specify the other options (such as the location of the `data` directory and installation mode) on the command line.

![*The Advanced Server service configuration file.*](images/epas_linux_advanced_server_service_configuration_file.png)

The file contains the following environment variables:

  - `PGENGINE` specifies the location of the engine and utility executable files.
  - `PGPORT` specifies the listener port for the database server.
  - `PGDATA` specifies the path to the data directory.
  - `PGLOG` specifies the location of the log file to which the server writes startup information.
  - Use `INITDBOPTS` to specify any `initdb` option or options that you wish to apply to the new cluster. For more information, see [Specifying Cluster Options with INITDBOPTS](02_using_a_package_manager_to_install_advanced_server#specifying_cluster_options_with_initdbopts).

You can modify the `edb-as-12.sysconfig` file before using the service command to invoke the `startup` script to change the listener port, data directory location, startup log location or installation mode. If you plan to create more than one instance on the same system, you may wish to copy the `edb-as-12.sysconfig` file (and the associated `edb-as-12` startup script) and modify the file contents for each additional instance that resides on the same host.

<div id="specifying_cluster_options_with_initdbopts" class="registered_link"></div>

#### Specifying Cluster Options with INITDBOPTS

You can use the `INITDBOPTS` variable to specify your cluster configuration preferences. By default, the `INITDBOPTS` variable is commented out in the service configuration file; unless modified, when you run the service startup script, the new cluster will be created in a mode compatible with Oracle databases. Clusters created in this mode will contain a database named `edb`, and have a database superuser named `enterprisedb`.

Clusters created in PostgreSQL mode do not include compatibility features. To create a new cluster in PostgreSQL mode, remove the pound sign (\#) in front of the `INITDBOPTS` variable, enabling the `"--no-redwood-compat"` option. Clusters created in PostgreSQL mode will contain a database named `postgres`, and have a database superuser named `postgres`.

If you initialize the database using Oracle compatibility mode, the installation includes:

  - Data dictionary views compatible with Oracle databases.
  - Oracle data type conversions.
  - Date values displayed in a format compatible with Oracle syntax.
  - Support for Oracle-styled concatenation rules (if you concatenate a string value with a `NULL` value, the returned value is the value of the string).
  - Support for the following Oracle built-in packages:

| Package         | Functionality compatible with Oracle Databases                                                                                                                              |

You may also specify multiple `initdb` options. For example, the following statement:

> `INITDBOPTS="--no-redwood-compat -U alice --locale=en_US.UTF-8"`

Creates a database cluster (without compatibility features for Oracle) that contains a database named `postgres` that is owned by a user named `alice`; the cluster uses `UTF-8` encoding.

In addition to the cluster configuration options documented in the PostgreSQL core documentation, Advanced Server supports the following `initdb` options:

> `--no-redwood-compat`

Include the `--no-redwood-compat` keywords to instruct the server to create the cluster in PostgreSQL mode. When the cluster is created in PostgreSQL mode, the name of the database superuser will be `postgres`, the name of the default database will be `postgres`, and Advanced Server’s features compatible with Oracle databases will not be available to the cluster.

> `--redwood-like`

Include the `--redwood-like` keywords to instruct the server to use an escape character (an empty string ('')) following the `LIKE` (or PostgreSQL-compatible `ILIKE`) operator in a SQL statement that is compatible with Oracle syntax.

> `--icu-short-form`

Include the `--icu-short-form` keywords to create a cluster that uses a default ICU (International Components for Unicode) collation for all databases in the cluster. For more information about Unicode collations, please refer to the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server Guide* available at:

> <https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs>

For more information about using `initdb`, and the available cluster configuration options, see the PostgreSQL Core Documentation available at:

> <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/app-initdb.html>

You can also view online help for `initdb` by assuming superuser privileges and entering:

> `/<path_to_initdb_installation_directory>/initdb --help`

Where `path_to_initdb_installation_directory` specifies the location of the `initdb` binary file.

### Modifying the Data Directory Location on CentOS or Redhat 7.x

On a CentOS or RedHat version 7.x host, the unit file is named `edb-as-12.service` and resides in `/usr/lib/systemd/system`. The unit file contains references to the location of the Advanced Server `data` directory. You should avoid making any modifications directly to the unit file because it may be overwritten during package upgrades.

By default, data files reside under `/var/lib/edb/as12/data` directory. To use a data directory that resides in a non-default location, create a copy of the unit file under the `/etc` directory:

> `cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-12.service /etc/systemd/system/`

After copying the unit file to the new location, create the service file `(/etc/systemd/system/edb-as-12.service)` and include `(/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-12.service)` within the file.

Then, use the following command to reload `systemd`, updating the modified service scripts:

> `systemctl daemon-reload`

Then, start the Advanced Server service with the following command:

> `systemctl start edb-as-12`

For information about setting an environment variable, see the [Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Reference Guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/reference/database-compatibility-for-oracle-developers-reference-guide/12/toc.html).

### Starting Multiple Postmasters with Different Clusters

You can configure Advanced Server to use multiple postmasters, each with its own database cluster. The steps required are version specific to the Linux host.

**On RHEL or CentOS 6.x**

The `edb-as12-server-core` RPM contains a script that starts the Advanced Server instance. The script can be copied, allowing you to run multiple services, with unique `data` directories and that monitor different ports. You must have `root` access to invoke or modify the script.

The example that follows creates a second instance on an Advanced Server host; the secondary instance is named `secondary`:

1.  Create a hard link in `/etc/rc.d/init.d` (or equivalent location) to the `edb-as-12` service (named `secondary-edb-as-12`):
    
    `ln edb-as-12 secondary-edb-as-12`

Be sure to pick a name that is not already used in `/etc/rc.d/init.d.`

2.  Create a file in `/etc/sysconfig/edb/as12/` named `secondary-edb-as-12`. This file is where you would typically define `PGDATA` and `PGOPTS`. Since `$PGDATA/postgresql.conf` will override many of these settings (except `PGDATA`) you might notice unexpected results on startup.

3.  Create the target `PGDATA` directory.

4.  Assume the identity of the Advanced Server database superuser (`enterprisedb`) and invoke `initdb` on the target `PGDATA`. For information about using `initdb`, please see the `PostgreSQL` Core Documentation available at:
    
    > <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/app-initdb.html>.

5.  Edit the `postgresql.conf` file to specify the port, address, TCP/IP settings, etc. for the `secondary` instance.

6.  Start the postmaster with the following command:
    
    `service secondary-edb-as-12 start`

**On RHEL or CentOS 7.x**

The `edb-as12-server-core` RPM for version 7.x contains a unit file that starts the Advanced Server instance. The file allows you to start multiple services, with unique `data` directories and that monitor different ports. You must have `root` access to invoke or modify the script.

The example that follows creates an Advanced Server installation with two instances; the secondary instance is named `secondary`:

1.  Make a copy of the default file with the new name. As noted at the top of the file, all modifications must reside under `/etc`. You must pick a name that is not already used `in /etc/systemd/system`.
    
    > `cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-12.service /etc/systemd/system/secondary-edb-as-12.service`

2.  Edit the file, changing `PGDATA` to point to the new `data` directory that you will create the cluster against.

3.  Create the target `PGDATA` with user `enterprisedb`.

4.  Run `initdb`, specifying the setup script:

> `/usr/edb/as12/bin/edb-as-12-setup initdb secondary-edb-as-12`

5.  Edit the `postgresql.conf` file for the new instance, specifying the port, the IP address, TCP/IP settings, etc.

6.  Make sure that new cluster runs after a reboot:
    
    `systemctl enable secondary-edb-as-12`

7.  Start the second cluster with the following command:
    
    `systemctl start secondary-edb-as-12`

### Creating an Advanced Server Repository on an Isolated Network

You can create a local repository to act as a host for the Advanced Server RPM packages if the server on which you wish to install Advanced Server (or supporting components) cannot directly access the EnterpriseDB repository. Please note that this is a high-level listing of the steps requires; you will need to modify the process for your individual network.

To create and use a local repository, you must:

1.  Use yum to install the `epel-release`, `yum-utils`, and `createrepo` packages:

<!-- end list -->

``` bash
yum install epel-release
yum install yum-utils
yum install createrepo
```

2.  Create a directory in which to store the repository:
    
    > `mkdir /srv/repos`

3.  Copy the RPM installation packages to your local repository. You can download the individual packages or use a tarball to populate the repository. The packages are available from the EnterpriseDB repository at:
    
    > `https://yum.enterprisedb.com/`

4.  Sync the RPM packages and create the repository.
    
    > `reposync -r edbas12 -p /srv/repos createrepo /srv/repos`

5.  Install your preferred webserver on the host that will act as your local repository, and ensure that the repository directory is accessible to the other servers on your network.

6.  On each isolated database server, configure yum to pull updates from the mirrored repository on your local network. For example, you might create a repository configuration file called `/etc/yum.repos.d/edb-repo` with connection information that specifies:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
[edbas12]
name=EnterpriseDB Advanced Server 12
baseurl=https:yum.your_domain.com/edbas12
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
```

After specifying the location and connection information for your local repository, you can use yum commands to install Advanced Server and its supporting components on the isolated servers. For example:

> `yum install edb-as12-server`
