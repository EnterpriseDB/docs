## ADD_MONTHS

The `ADD_MONTHS` functions adds (or subtracts if the second parameter is negative) the specified number of months to the given date. The resulting day of the month is the same as the day of the month of the given date except when the day is the last day of the month in which case the resulting date always falls on the last day of the month.

Any fractional portion of the number of months parameter is truncated before performing the calculation.

If the given date contains a time portion, it is carried forward to the result unchanged.

The following are examples of the `ADD_MONTHS` function.

```text
SELECT ADD_MONTHS('13-JUN-07',4) FROM DUAL;

     add_months
--------------------
 13-OCT-07 00:00:00
(1 row)

SELECT ADD_MONTHS('31-DEC-06',2) FROM DUAL;

     add_months
--------------------
 28-FEB-07 00:00:00
(1 row)

SELECT ADD_MONTHS('31-MAY-04',-3) FROM DUAL;

     add_months
--------------------
 29-FEB-04 00:00:00
(1 row)
```

## EXTRACT

The `EXTRACT` function retrieves subfields such as year or hour from date/time values. The `EXTRACT` function returns values of type `DOUBLE PRECISION`. The following are valid field names:

`YEAR`

> The year field

```text
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40') FROM DUAL;

 date_part
-----------
      2001
(1 row)
```

`MONTH`

> The number of the month within the year (1 - 12)

```text
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40') FROM DUAL;

 date_part
-----------
         2
(1 row)
```

`DAY`

> The day (of the month) field (1 - 31)

```text
SELECT EXTRACT(DAY FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40') FROM DUAL;

 date_part
-----------
        16
(1 row)
```

`HOUR`

> The hour field (0 - 23)

```text
SELECT EXTRACT(HOUR FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40') FROM DUAL;

 date_part
-----------
        20
(1 row)
```

`MINUTE`

> The minutes field (0 - 59)

```text
SELECT EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40') FROM DUAL;

 date_part
-----------
        38
(1 row)
```

`SECOND`

> The seconds field, including fractional parts (0 - 59)

```text
SELECT EXTRACT(SECOND FROM TIMESTAMP '2001-02-16 20:38:40') FROM DUAL;

 date_part
-----------
        40
(1 row)
```

## MONTHS_BETWEEN

The `MONTHS_BETWEEN` function returns the number of months between two dates. The result is a numeric value which is positive if the first date is greater than the second date or negative if the first date is less than the second date.

The result is always a whole number of months if the day of the month of both date parameters is the same, or both date parameters fall on the last day of their respective months.

The following are some examples of the `MONTHS_BETWEEN` function.

```text
SELECT MONTHS_BETWEEN('15-DEC-06','15-OCT-06') FROM DUAL;

 months_between
----------------
              2
(1 row)

SELECT MONTHS_BETWEEN('15-OCT-06','15-DEC-06') FROM DUAL;

 months_between
----------------
             -2
(1 row)

SELECT MONTHS_BETWEEN('31-JUL-00','01-JUL-00') FROM DUAL;

 months_between
----------------
    0.967741935
(1 row)

SELECT MONTHS_BETWEEN('01-JAN-07','01-JAN-06') FROM DUAL;

 months_between
----------------
             12
(1 row)
```

## NEXT_DAY

The `NEXT_DAY` function returns the first occurrence of the given weekday strictly greater than the given date. At least the first three letters of the weekday must be specified - e.g., `SAT`. If the given date contains a time portion, it is carried forward to the result unchanged.

The following are examples of the `NEXT_DAY` function.

```text
SELECT NEXT_DAY(TO_DATE('13-AUG-07','DD-MON-YY'),'SUNDAY') FROM DUAL;

      next_day
--------------------
 19-AUG-07 00:00:00
(1 row)

SELECT NEXT_DAY(TO_DATE('13-AUG-07','DD-MON-YY'),'MON') FROM DUAL;

      next_day
--------------------
 20-AUG-07 00:00:00
(1 row)
```

## NEW_TIME

The `NEW_TIME` function converts a date and time from one time zone to another. `NEW_TIME` returns a value of type `DATE`. The syntax is:

```text
NEW_TIME(DATE, time_zone1, time_zone2)
```

`time_zone1` and `time_zone2` must be string values from the Time Zone column of the following table:

Table ‑ Time Zones

| Time Zone | Offset from UTC | Description                 |
| --------- | --------------- | --------------------------- |
| AST       | UTC+4           | Atlantic Standard Time      |
| ADT       | UTC+3           | Atlantic Daylight Time      |

| BDT       | UTC+10          | Bering Daylight Time        |
| CST       | UTC+6           | Central Standard Time       |
| CDT       | UTC+5           | Central Daylight Time       |
| EST       | UTC+5           | Eastern Standard Time       |
| EDT       | UTC+4           | Eastern Daylight Time       |
| GMT       | UTC             | Greenwich Mean Time         |
| HST       | UTC+10          | Alaska-Hawaii Standard Time |
| HDT       | UTC+9           | Alaska-Hawaii Daylight Time |
| MST       | UTC+7           | Mountain Standard Time      |
| MDT       | UTC+6           | Mountain Daylight Time      |
| NST       | UTC+3:30        | Newfoundland Standard Time  |
| PST       | UTC+8           | Pacific Standard Time       |
| PDT       | UTC+7           | Pacific Daylight Time       |

| YDT       | UTC+8           | Yukon Daylight Time         |

Following is an example of the `NEW_TIME` function:

```text
SELECT NEW_TIME(TO_DATE('08-13-07 10:35:15','MM-DD-YY HH24:MI:SS'),'AST', 'PST') "Pacific Standard Time" FROM DUAL;

Pacific Standard Time
---------------------
 13-AUG-07 06:35:15
(1 row)
```

## ROUND

The `ROUND` function returns a date rounded according to a specified template pattern. If the template pattern is omitted, the date is rounded to the nearest day. The following table shows the template patterns for the `ROUND` function.

## CURRENT DATE/TIME

Advanced Server provides a number of functions that return values related to the current date and time. These functions all return values based on the start time of the current transaction.

- `CURRENT_DATE`
- `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`
- `LOCALTIMESTAMP`
- `LOCALTIMESTAMP(precision)`

`CURRENT_DATE` returns the current date and time based on the start time of the current transaction. The value of `CURRENT_DATE` will not change if called multiple times within a transaction.

```text
SELECT CURRENT_DATE FROM DUAL;

   date
-----------
 06-AUG-07
```

`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` returns the current date and time. When called from a single SQL statement, it will return the same value for each occurrence within the statement. If called from multiple statements within a transaction, may return different values for each occurrence. If called from a function, may return a different value than the value returned by current_timestamp in the caller.

```text
SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP FROM DUAL;

                current_timestamp | current_timestamp
----------------------------------+----------------------------------
 02-SEP-13 17:52:29.261473 +05:00 | 02-SEP-13 17:52:29.261474 +05:00
```

`LOCALTIMESTAMP` can optionally be given a precision parameter which causes the result to be rounded to that many fractional digits in the seconds field. Without a precision parameter, the result is given to the full available precision.

```text
SELECT LOCALTIMESTAMP FROM DUAL;

       timestamp
------------------------
 06-AUG-07 16:11:35.973
(1 row)

SELECT LOCALTIMESTAMP(2) FROM DUAL;

       timestamp
-----------------------
 06-AUG-07 16:11:44.58
(1 row)
```

Since these functions return the start time of the current transaction, their values do not change during the transaction. This is considered a feature: the intent is to allow a single transaction to have a consistent notion of the “current” time, so that multiple modifications within the same transaction bear the same time stamp. Other database systems may advance these values more frequently.

## NUMTODSINTERVAL

The `NUMTODSINTERVAL` function converts a numeric value to a time interval that includes day through second interval units. When calling the function, specify the smallest fractional interval type to be included in the result set. The valid interval types are `DAY`, `HOUR`, `MINUTE`, and `SECOND`.

The following example converts a numeric value to a time interval that includes days and hours:

```text
SELECT numtodsinterval(100, ‘hour’);
numtodsinterval
---------------
4 days 04:00:00
(1 row)
```

The following example converts a numeric value to a time interval that includes minutes and seconds:

```text
SELECT numtodsinterval(100, ‘second’);
numtodsinterval
---------------
1 min 40 secs
(1 row)
```

## NUMTOYMINTERVAL

The `NUMTOYMINTERVAL` function converts a numeric value to a time interval that includes year through month interval units. When calling the function, specify the smallest fractional interval type to be included in the result set. The valid interval types are `YEAR` and `MONTH`.

The following example converts a numeric value to a time interval that includes years and months:

```text
SELECT numtoyminterval(100, ‘month’);
numtoyminterval
---------------
8 years 4 mons
(1 row)
```

The following example converts a numeric value to a time interval that includes years only:

```text
SELECT numtoyminterval(100, ‘year’);
numtoyminterval
---------------
100 years
(1 row)
```
