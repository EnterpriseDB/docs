The Dynamic Runtime Instrumentation Tools Architecture (DRITA) allows a DBA to query catalog views to determine the *wait events* that affect the performance of individual sessions or the system as a whole. DRITA records the number of times each event occurs as well as the time spent waiting; you can use this information to diagnose performance problems. DRITA offers this functionality, while consuming minimal system resources.

DRITA compares *snapshots* to evaluate the performance of a system. A snapshot is a saved set of system performance data at a given point in time. Each snapshot is identified by a unique ID number; you can use snapshot ID numbers with DRITA reporting functions to return system performance statistics.
