Advanced Server's `postgresql.conf` file includes a configuration parameter named `timed_statistics` that controls the collection of timing data. The valid parameter values are `TRUE` or `FALSE`; the default value is `FALSE`.

This is a dynamic parameter which can be modified in the `postgresql.conf` file, or while a session is in progress. To enable DRITA, you must either:

Modify the `postgresql.conf` file, setting the `timed_statistics` parameter to TRUE.

or

Connect to the server with the EDB-PSQL client, and invoke the command:

`SET timed_statistics = TRUE`

After modifying the timed_s~tatistics parameter, take a starting snapshot. A snapshot captures the current state of each timer and event counter. The server will compare the starting snapshot to a later snapshot to gauge system performance.

Use the `edbsnap()` function to take the beginning snapshot:

```
edb=# SELECT * FROM edbsnap();
       edbsnap
----------------------
 Statement processed.
(1 row)
```

Then, run the workload that you would like to evaluate; when the workload has completed (or at a strategic point during the workload), take another snapshot:

```
edb=# SELECT * FROM edbsnap();
       edbsnap
----------------------
 Statement processed.
(1 row)
```

You can capture multiple snapshots during a session. Then, use the DRITA functions and reports to manage and compare the snapshots to evaluate performance information.
