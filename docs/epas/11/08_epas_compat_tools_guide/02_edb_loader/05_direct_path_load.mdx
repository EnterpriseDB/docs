title: "Direct Path Load"

<div id="direct_path_load" class="registered_link"></div>

During a direct path load, EDB\*Loader writes the data directly to the database pages, which is then synchronized to disk. The insert processing associated with a conventional path load is bypassed, thereby resulting in a performance improvement.

Bypassing insert processing reduces the types of constraints that may exist on the target table. The following types of constraints are permitted on the target table of a direct path load:

- Primary key
- Not null constraints
- Indexes (unique or non-unique)

The restrictions on the target table of a direct path load are the following:

- Triggers are not permitted
- Check constraints are not permitted
- Foreign key constraints on the target table referencing another table are not permitted
- Foreign key constraints on other tables referencing the target table are not permitted
- The table must not be partitioned
- Rules may exist on the target table, but they are not executed

**Note:** Currently, a direct path load in EDB\*Loader is more restrictive than in Oracle SQL\*Loader. The preceding restrictions do not apply to Oracle SQL*Loader in most cases. The following restrictions apply to a control file used in a direct path load:

- Multiple table loads are not supported. That is, only one `INTO TABLE` clause may be specified in the control file.
- SQL expressions may not be used in the data field definitions of the `INTO TABLE` clause.
- The `FREEZE` option is not supported for direct path loading.

To run a direct path load, add the `DIRECT=TRUE` option as shown by the following example:

```
$ /usr/edb/as11/bin/edbldr -d edb USERID=enterprisedb/password CONTROL=emp.ctl DIRECT=TRUE
