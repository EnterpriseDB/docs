EDB\*Loader is a high-performance bulk data loader that provides an interface compatible with Oracle databases for Advanced Server. The EDB\*Loader command line utility loads data from an input source, typically a file, into one or more tables using a subset of the parameters offered by Oracle SQL*Loader.

EDB*Loader features include:

- Support for the Oracle SQL*Loader data loading methods - conventional path load, direct path load, and parallel direct path load
- Syntax for control file directives compatible with Oracle SQL*Loader
- Input data with delimiter-separated or fixed-width fields
- Bad file for collecting rejected records
- Loading of multiple target tables
- Discard file for collecting records that do not meet the selection criteria of any target table
- Log file for recording the EDB*Loader session and any error messages
- Data loading from standard input and remote loading, particularly useful for large data sources on remote hosts

These features are explained in detail in the following sections.

**Note:** The following are important version compatibility restrictions between the EDB*Loader client and the database server.

- Invoking EDB\*Loader is done using a client program called `edbldr`, which is used to pass parameters and directive information to the database server. **It is strongly recommended that the 11 EDB\*Loader client (that is, the `edbldr` program supplied with Advanced Server 11) be used to load data only into version 11 of the database server. In general, the EDB\*Loader client and database server should be the same version.**
- Use of a version 11, 10, 9.6, 9.5, 9.4 or 9.3 EDB*Loader client is not supported for database servers version 9.2 or earlier.
