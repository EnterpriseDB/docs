As with Oracle SQL\*Loader, EDB*Loader supports three data loading methods:

- Conventional path load
- Direct path load
- Parallel direct path load

Conventional path load is the default method used by EDB*Loader. Basic insert processing is used to add rows to the table.

The advantage of a conventional path load over the other methods is that table constraints and database objects defined on the table such as primary keys, not null constraints, check constraints, unique indexes, foreign key constraints, and triggers are enforced during a conventional path load.

One exception is that the Advanced Server *rules* defined on the table are not enforced. EDB\*Loader can load tables on which rules are defined, but the rules are not executed. As a consequence, partitioned tables implemented using rules cannot be loaded using EDB*Loader.

**Note:** Advanced Server rules are created by the `CREATE RULE` command. Advanced Server rules are not the same database objects as rules and rule sets used in Oracle.

EDB*Loader also supports direct path loads. A direct path load is faster than a conventional path load, but requires the removal of most types of constraints and triggers from the table. See Section [2.5](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/database-compatibility-for-oracle-developers-tools-and-utilities-guide/11/Database_Compatibility_for_Oracle_Developers_Tools_and_Utilities_Guide.1.09.html#) for information on direct path loads.

Finally, EDB\*Loader supports parallel direct path loads. A parallel direct path load provides even greater performance improvement by permitting multiple EDB*Loader sessions to run simultaneously to load a single table. See Section [2.6](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/database-compatibility-for-oracle-developers-tools-and-utilities-guide/11/Database_Compatibility_for_Oracle_Developers_Tools_and_Utilities_Guide.1.10.html#) for information on parallel direct path loads.
