EDB\*Loader supports a feature called *remote loading*. In remote loading, the database containing the table to be loaded is running on a database server on a different host than from where EDB\*Loader is invoked with the input data source.

This feature is useful if you have a large amount of data to be loaded, and you do not want to create a large data file on the host running the database server.

In addition, you can use the standard input feature to pipe the data from the data source such as another program or script, directly to EDB\*Loader, which then loads the table in the remote database. This bypasses the process of having to create a data file on disk for EDB\*Loader.

Performing remote loading along with using standard input requires the following:

- The `edbldr` program must be installed on the client host on which it is to be invoked with the data source for the EDB\*Loader session.
- The control file must contain the clause `INFILE` '`stdin`' so you can pipe the data directly into EDB\*Loaderâ€™s standard input. See Section 2.3 for information on the `INFILE` clause and the EDB\*Loader control file.

- All files used by EDB\*Loader such as the control file, bad file, discard file, and log file must reside on, or are created on, the client host on which `edbldr` is invoked.
- When invoking EDB\*Loader, use the `-h` option to specify the IP address of the remote database server. See Section 2.4 for information on invoking EDB\*Loader.
- Use the operating system pipe operator (|) or input redirection operator (<) to supply the input data to EDB\*Loader.

The following example loads a database running on a database server at `192.168.1.14` using data piped from a source named `datasource`.

```
datasource | ./edbldr -d edb -h 192.168.1.14 USERID=enterprisedb/password CONTROL=remote.ctl
```

The following is another example of how standard input can be used:

```
./edbldr -d edb -h 192.168.1.14 USERID=enterprisedb/password CONTROL=remote.ctl < datasource
```
