The tables that follow list the RPM packages that are available from EnterpriseDB.

You can also use the `yum search` command to access a list of the packages that are currently available from your configured repository. Open a command line, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

> `yum search` *`package`*

Where *`package`* is the search term that specifies the name (or partial name) of a package. The repository search will return a list of available packages that include the specified search term.
