You can use the `INITDBOPTS` variable to specify your cluster configuration preferences. By default, the `INITDBOPTS` variable is commented out in the service configuration file; unless modified, when you run the service startup script, the new cluster will be created in a mode compatible with Oracle databases. Clusters created in this mode will contain a database named `edb`, and have a database superuser named `enterprisedb`.

To create a new cluster in PostgreSQL mode, remove the pound sign (#) in front of the `INITDBOPTS` variable, enabling the "`--no-redwood-compat`" option. Clusters created in PostgreSQL mode will contain a database named `postgres`, and have a database superuser named `postgres`.

You may also specify multiple `initdb` options. For example, the following statement:

`INITDBOPTS="--no-redwood-compat -U alice --locale=en_US.UTF-8"`

Creates a database cluster (without compatibility features for Oracle) that contains a database named `postgres` that is owned by a user named alice; the cluster uses `UTF-8` encoding.

In addition to the cluster configuration options documented in the PostgreSQL core documentation, Advanced Server supports the following `initdb` options:

`--no-redwood-compat`

> Include the `--no-redwood-compat` keywords to instruct the server to create the cluster in PostgreSQL mode. When the cluster is created in PostgreSQL mode, the name of the database superuser will be `postgres`, the name of the default database will be `postgres`, and Advanced Server’s features compatible with Oracle databases will not be available to the cluster.
>

`--redwood-like`

> Include the `--redwood-like` keywords to instruct the server to use an escape character (an empty string ('')) following the LIKE (or PostgreSQL-compatible `ILIKE`) operator in a SQL statement that is compatible with Oracle syntax.
>

`--icu-short-form`

> Include the `--icu-short-form` keywords to create a cluster that uses a default ICU (International Components for Unicode) collation for all databases in the cluster. For more information about Unicode collations, please refer to the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server Guide* available at:

You can also view online help for `initdb` by assuming superuser privileges and entering:

> /*`path_to_initdb_installation_directory`*/`initdb --help`

Where *`path_to_initdb_installation_directory`* specifies the location of the `initdb` binary file.
