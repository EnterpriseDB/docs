This chapter describes the built-in packages that are provided with Advanced Server. For certain packages, non-superusers must be explicitly granted the `EXECUTE` privilege on the package before using any of the packageâ€™s functions or procedures. For most of the built-in packages, `EXECUTE` privilege has been granted to `PUBLIC` by default.

For information about using the `GRANT` command to provide access to a package, please see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Reference Guide*, available at:

https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/product-documentation

All built-in packages are owned by the special `sys` user which must be specified when granting or revoking privileges on built-in packages:

```
GRANT EXECUTE ON PACKAGE SYS.UTL_FILE TO john;
```
