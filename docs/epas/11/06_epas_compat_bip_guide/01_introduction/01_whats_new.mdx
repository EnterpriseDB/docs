The following database compatibility for Oracle features have been added to Advanced Server 10 to create Advanced Server 11:

- Advanced Server now supports SPL standalone procedure overloading. Note that this feature is not compatible with Oracle databases. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer’s Guide.*
- Advanced Server now supports the `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` directive within any SPL block to provide the autonomous transaction capability. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer’s Guide*. For affected SPL programs, see Section  [2.1.2](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/database-compatibility-for-oracle-developers-built-in-package-guide/11/Database_Compatibility_for_Oracle_Developers_Built-in_Package_Guide.1.07.html#pID0E0W5G0HA).
