Use the `ALTER TABLE… DROP PARTITION` command to delete a partition definition, and the data stored in that partition. The syntax is:

`ALTER TABLE` *`table_name`* `DROP PARTITION` *`partition_name`;*

**Parameters**

*`table_name`*

> The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the partitioned table.

*`partition_name`*

> The name of the partition to be deleted.

**Description**

The `ALTER TABLE… DROP PARTITION` command deletes a partition and any data stored on that partition. The `ALTER TABLE… DROP PARTITION` command can drop partitions of a `LIST` or `RANGE` partitioned table; please note that this command does not work on a `HASH` partitioned table. When you delete a partition, any subpartitions (of that partition) are deleted as well.

To use the `DROP PARTITION` clause, you must be the owner of the partitioning root, a member of a group that owns the table, or have database superuser or administrative privileges.

## Example - Deleting a Partition

The example that follows deletes a partition of the `sales` table. Use the following command to create the `sales` table:

```
CREATE TABLE sales
(
  dept_no     number,
  part_no     varchar2,
  country     varchar2(20),
  date    date,
  amount  number
)
PARTITION BY LIST(country)
(
  PARTITION europe VALUES('FRANCE', 'ITALY'),
  PARTITION asia VALUES('INDIA', 'PAKISTAN'),
  PARTITION americas VALUES('US', 'CANADA')
);
```

Querying the `ALL_TAB_PARTITIONS` view displays the partition names:

```
acctg=# SELECT partition_name, high_value FROM ALL_TAB_PARTITIONS;
 partition_name |             high_value
----------------+-------------------------------------
 EUROPE         | FOR VALUES IN ('FRANCE', 'ITALY')
 ASIA           | FOR VALUES IN ('INDIA', 'PAKISTAN')
 AMERICAS       | FOR VALUES IN ('US', 'CANADA')
(3 rows)
```

To delete the americas partition from the `sales` table, invoke the following command:

> `ALTER TABLE sales DROP PARTITION americas;`

Querying the `ALL_TAB_PARTITIONS` view demonstrates that the partition has been successfully deleted:

```
acctg=# SELECT partition_name, high_value FROM ALL_TAB_PARTITIONS;
 partition_name |             high_value
----------------+-------------------------------------
 EUROPE         | FOR VALUES IN ('FRANCE', 'ITALY')
 ASIA           | FOR VALUES IN ('INDIA', 'PAKISTAN')
(2 rows)
```
