title: "Transaction Control"
---

<div id="transaction_control" class="registered_link"></div>

There may be circumstances where it is desired that all updates to a database are to occur successfully, or none are to occur at all if any error occurs. A set of database updates that are to all occur successfully as a single unit, or are not to occur at all, is said to be a *transaction*.

A common example in banking is a funds transfer between two accounts. The two parts of the transaction are the withdrawal of funds from one account, and the deposit of the funds in another account. Both parts of this transaction must occur otherwise the bankâ€™s books will be out of balance. The deposit and withdrawal are one transaction.

An SPL application can be created that uses a style of transaction control compatible with Oracle databases if the following conditions are met:

- The `edb_stmt_level_tx` parameter must be set to `TRUE`. This prevents the action of unconditionally rolling back all database updates within the `BEGIN/END` block if any exception occurs. See Section [1.3.4](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/database-compatibility-for-oracle-developers-guide/11/Database_Compatibility_for_Oracle_Developers_Guide.1.006.html#pID0E0JOL0HA) for more information on the `edb_stmt_level_tx` parameter.

- The application must not be running in autocommit mode. If autocommit mode is on, each successful database update is immediately committed and cannot be undone. The manner in which autocommit mode is turned on or off is application dependent.

A transaction begins when the first SQL command is encountered in the SPL program. All subsequent SQL commands are included as part of that transaction. The transaction ends when one of the following occurs:

- An unhandled exception occurs in which case the effects of all database updates made during the transaction are rolled back and the transaction is aborted.
- A `COMMIT` command is encountered in which case the effect of all database updates made during the transaction become permanent.
- A `ROLLBACK` command is encountered in which case the effects of all database updates made during the transaction are rolled back and the transaction is aborted. If a new SQL command is encountered, a new transaction begins.
- Control returns to the calling application (such as Java, PSQL, etc.) in which case the action of the application determines whether the transaction is committed or rolled back unless the transaction is within a block in which `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` has been declared in which case the commitment or rollback of the transaction occurs independently of the calling program.

**Note:** Unlike Oracle, DDL commands such as `CREATE TABLE` do not implicitly occur within their own transaction. Therefore, DDL commands do not automatically cause an immediate database commit as in Oracle, and DDL commands may be rolled back just like DML commands.

A transaction may span one or more `BEGIN/END` blocks, or a single ``BEGIN/END` block may contain one or more transactions.

The following sections discuss the `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK` commands in more detail.

## COMMIT

The `COMMIT` command makes all database updates made during the current transaction permanent, and ends the current transaction.

> `COMMIT [ WORK ];`

The `COMMIT` command may be used within anonymous blocks, stored procedures, or functions. Within an SPL program, it may appear in the executable section and/or the exception section.

In the following example, the third `INSERT` command in the anonymous block results in an error. The effect of the first two `INSERT` commands are retained as shown by the first `SELECT` command. Even after issuing a `ROLLBACK` command, the two rows remain in the table as shown by the second `SELECT` command verifying that they were indeed committed.

**Note:** The `edb_stmt_level_tx` configuration parameter shown in the example below can be set for the entire database using the `ALTER DATABASE` command, or it can be set for the entire database server by changing it in the `postgresql.conf` file.

```
\set AUTOCOMMIT off
SET edb_stmt_level_tx TO on;

BEGIN
    INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50, 'FINANCE', 'DALLAS');
    INSERT INTO dept VALUES (60, 'MARKETING', 'CHICAGO');
    COMMIT;
    INSERT INTO dept VALUES (70, 'HUMAN RESOURCES', 'CHICAGO');
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('SQLERRM: ' || SQLERRM);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('SQLCODE: ' || SQLCODE);
END;

SQLERRM: value too long for type character varying(14)
SQLCODE: 22001

SELECT * FROM dept;

deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | FINANCE    | DALLAS
     60 | MARKETING  | CHICAGO
(6 rows)

ROLLBACK;

SELECT * FROM dept;

deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | FINANCE    | DALLAS
     60 | MARKETING  | CHICAGO
(6 rows)
```

## ROLLBACK

The ROLLBACK command undoes all database updates made during the current transaction, and ends the current transaction.

> `ROLLBACK [ WORK ];`

The `ROLLBACK` command may be used within anonymous blocks, stored procedures, or functions. Within an SPL program, it may appear in the executable section and/or the exception section.

In the following example, the exception section contains a `ROLLBACK` command. Even though the first two `INSERT` commands are executed successfully, the third results in an exception that results in the rollback of all the `INSERT` commands in the anonymous block.

```
\set AUTOCOMMIT off
SET edb_stmt_level_tx TO on;

BEGIN
    INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50, 'FINANCE', 'DALLAS');
    INSERT INTO dept VALUES (60, 'MARKETING', 'CHICAGO');
    INSERT INTO dept VALUES (70, 'HUMAN RESOURCES', 'CHICAGO');
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        ROLLBACK;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('SQLERRM: ' || SQLERRM);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('SQLCODE: ' || SQLCODE);
END;

SQLERRM: value too long for type character varying(14)
SQLCODE: 22001

SELECT * FROM dept;

deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
(4 rows)
```

The following is a more complex example using both `COMMIT` and `ROLLBACK`. First, the following stored procedure is created which inserts a new employee.

```
\set AUTOCOMMIT off
SET edb_stmt_level_tx TO on;

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE emp_insert (
    p_empno         IN emp.empno%TYPE,
    p_ename         IN emp.ename%TYPE,
    p_job           IN emp.job%TYPE,
    p_mgr           IN emp.mgr%TYPE,
    p_hiredate      IN emp.hiredate%TYPE,
    p_sal           IN emp.sal%TYPE,
    p_comm          IN emp.comm%TYPE,
    p_deptno        IN emp.deptno%TYPE
)
IS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO emp VALUES (
        p_empno,
        p_ename,
        p_job,
        p_mgr,
        p_hiredate,
        p_sal,
        p_comm,
        p_deptno);

    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Added employee...');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee # : ' || p_empno);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Name       : ' || p_ename);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Job        : ' || p_job);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Manager    : ' || p_mgr);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hire Date  : ' || p_hiredate);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Salary     : ' || p_sal);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Commission : ' || p_comm);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Dept #     : ' || p_deptno);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('----------------------');

END;
```

Note that this procedure has no exception section so any error that may occur is propagated up to the calling program.

The following anonymous block is run. Note the use of the `COMMIT` command after all calls to the `emp_insert` procedure and the `ROLLBACK` command in the exception section.

```
BEGIN
    emp_insert(9601,'FARRELL','ANALYST',7902,'03-MAR-08',5000,NULL,40);
    emp_insert(9602,'TYLER','ANALYST',7900,'25-JAN-08',4800,NULL,40);
    COMMIT;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('SQLERRM: ' || SQLERRM);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('An error occurred - roll back inserts');
        ROLLBACK;
END;

Added employee...
Employee # : 9601
Name       : FARRELL
Job        : ANALYST
Manager    : 7902
Hire Date  : 03-MAR-08 00:00:00
Salary     : 5000
Commission :

Dept #     : 40
----------------------

Added employee...
Employee # : 9602
Name       : TYLER
Job        : ANALYST
Manager    : 7900
Hire Date  : 25-JAN-08 00:00:00
Salary     : 4800
Commission :

Dept #     : 40
----------------------
```

The following `SELECT` command shows that employees Farrell and Tyler were successfully added.

```
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno > 9600;

empno |  ename  |   job   | mgr  |      hiredate      |   sal   | comm | deptno
-------+---------+---------+------+--------------------+---------+------+--------
  9601 | FARRELL | ANALYST | 7902 | 03-MAR-08 00:00:00 | 5000.00 |      |     40
  9602 | TYLER   | ANALYST | 7900 | 25-JAN-08 00:00:00 | 4800.00 |      |     40
(2 rows)
```

Now, execute the following anonymous block:

```
BEGIN
    emp_insert(9603,'HARRISON','SALESMAN',7902,'13-DEC-07',5000,3000,20);
    emp_insert(9604,'JARVIS','SALESMAN',7902,'05-MAY-08',4800,4100,11);
    COMMIT;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('SQLERRM: ' || SQLERRM);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('An error occurred - roll back inserts');
        ROLLBACK;
END;

Added employee...
Employee # : 9603
Name       : HARRISON
Job        : SALESMAN
Manager    : 7902
Hire Date  : 13-DEC-07 00:00:00
Salary     : 5000
Commission : 3000

Dept #     : 20
----------------------

SQLERRM: insert or update on table "emp" violates foreign key constraint "emp_ref_dept_fk"
An error occurred - roll back inserts
```

A `SELECT` command run against the table yields the following:

```
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno > 9600;

empno |  ename  |   job   | mgr  |      hiredate      |   sal   | comm | deptno
-------+---------+---------+------+--------------------+---------+------+--------
  9601 | FARRELL | ANALYST | 7902 | 03-MAR-08 00:00:00 | 5000.00 |      |     40
  9602 | TYLER   | ANALYST | 7900 | 25-JAN-08 00:00:00 | 4800.00 |      |     40
(2 rows)
```

The `ROLLBACK` command in the exception section successfully undoes the insert of employee Harrison. Also note that employees Farrell and Tyler are still in the table as their inserts were made permanent by the `COMMIT` command in the first anonymous block.

**Note:** Executing a `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` in a plpgsql procedure will throw an error if there is an Oracle-style SPL procedure on the runtime stack.

## PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION

An SPL program can be declared as an autonomous transaction by specifying the following directive in the declaration section of the SPL block:

`PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION;`

An *autonomous transaction* is an independent transaction started by a calling program. A commit or rollback of SQL commands within the autonomous transaction has no effect on the commit or rollback in any transaction of the calling program. A commit or rollback in the calling program has no effect on the commit or rollback of SQL commands in the autonomous transaction.

The following SPL programs can include `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION`:

- Standalone procedures and functions
- Anonymous blocks
- Procedures and functions declared as subprograms within packages and other calling procedures, functions, and anonymous blocks
- Triggers
- Object type methods

The following are issues and restrictions related to autonomous transactions:

- Each autonomous transaction consumes a connection slot for as long as it is in progress. In some cases, this may mean that the `max_connections` parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file should be raised.
- In most respects, an autonomous transaction behaves exactly as if it was a completely separate session, but GUCs (that is, settings established with `SET`) are a deliberate exception. Autonomous transactions absorb the surrounding values and can propagate values they commit to the outer transaction.
- Autonomous transactions can be nested, but there is a limit of 16 levels of autonomous transactions within a single session.

- Parallel query is not supported within autonomous transactions.
- The Advanced Server implementation of autonomous transactions is not entirely compatible with Oracle databases in that the Advanced Server autonomous transaction does not produce an ERROR if there is an uncommitted transaction at the end of an SPL block.

The following set of examples illustrates the usage of autonomous transactions. This first set of scenarios show the default behavior when there are no autonomous transactions.

Before each scenario, the `dept` table is reset to the following initial values:

```
SELECT * FROM dept;

 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
(4 rows)
```

***Scenario 1a â€“ No autonomous transactions with only a final COMMIT***

This first set of scenarios show the insertion of three rows starting just after the initial `BEGIN` command of the transaction, then from within an anonymous block within the starting transaction, and finally from a stored procedure executed from within the anonymous block.

The stored procedure is the following:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE insert_dept_70 IS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO dept VALUES (70,'MARKETING','LOS ANGELES');
END;
```

The PSQL session is the following:

```
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50,'HR','DENVER');
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO dept VALUES (60,'FINANCE','CHICAGO');
    insert_dept_70;
END;
COMMIT;
```

After the final commit, all three rows are inserted:

```
SELECT * FROM dept ORDER BY 1;

 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | HR         | DENVER
     60 | FINANCE    | CHICAGO
     70 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(7 rows)
```

***Scenario 1b â€“ No autonomous transactions, but a final ROLLBACK***

The next scenario shows that a final `ROLLBACK` command after all inserts results in the rollback of all three insertions:

```
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50,'HR','DENVER');
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO dept VALUES (60,'FINANCE','CHICAGO');
    insert_dept_70;
END;
ROLLBACK;

SELECT * FROM dept ORDER BY 1;

 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
(4 rows)
```

***Scenario 1c â€“ No autonomous transactions, but anonymous block ROLLBACK***

A `ROLLBACK` command given at the end of the anonymous block also eliminates all three prior insertions:

```
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50,'HR','DENVER');
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO dept VALUES (60,'FINANCE','CHICAGO');
    insert_dept_70;
    ROLLBACK;
END;
COMMIT;

SELECT * FROM dept ORDER BY 1;

 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
(4 rows)
```

This next set of scenarios shows the effect of using autonomous transactions with `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` in various locations.

***Scenario 2a â€“ Autonomous transaction of anonymous block with COMMIT***

The procedure remains as initially created:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE insert_dept_70 IS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO dept VALUES (70,'MARKETING','LOS ANGELES');
END;
```

Now, the `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` is given with the anonymous block along with the `COMMIT` command at the end of the anonymous block.

```
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50,'HR','DENVER');
DECLARE
    PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION;
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO dept VALUES (60,'FINANCE','CHICAGO');
    insert_dept_70;
    COMMIT;
END;
ROLLBACK;
```

After the `ROLLBACK` at the end of the transaction, only the first row insertion at the very beginning of the transaction is discarded. The other two row insertions within the anonymous block with `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` have been independently committed.

```
SELECT * FROM dept ORDER BY 1;

 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     60 | FINANCE    | CHICAGO
     70 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(6 rows)
```

***Scenario 2b â€“ Autonomous transaction anonymous block with COMMIT including procedure with ROLLBACK, but not an autonomous transaction procedure***

Now, the procedure has the `ROLLBACK` command at the end. Note, however, that the `PRAGMA ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTION` is not included in this procedure.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE insert_dept_70 IS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO dept VALUES (70,'MARKETING','LOS ANGELES');
    ROLLBACK;
END;
```

Now, the rollback within the procedure removes the two rows inserted within the anonymous block (`deptno` 60 and 70) before the final `COMMIT` command within the anonymous block.

```
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50,'HR','DENVER');
DECLARE
    PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION;
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO dept VALUES (60,'FINANCE','CHICAGO');
    insert_dept_70;
    COMMIT;
END;
COMMIT;
```

After the final commit at the end of the transaction, the only row inserted is the first one from the beginning of the transaction. Since the anonymous block is an autonomous transaction, the rollback within the enclosed procedure has no effect on the insertion that occurs before the anonymous block is executed.

```
SELECT * FROM dept ORDER by 1;

 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | HR         | DENVER
(5 rows)
```

***Scenario 2c â€“ Autonomous transaction anonymous block with COMMIT including procedure with ROLLBACK that is also an autonomous transaction procedure***

Now, the procedure with the `ROLLBACK` command at the end also has `PRAGMA ANONYMOUS_TRANSACTION` included. This isolates the effect of the `ROLLBACK` command within the procedure.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE insert_dept_70 IS
    PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION;
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO dept VALUES (70,'MARKETING','LOS ANGELES');
    ROLLBACK;
END;
```

Now, the rollback within the procedure removes the row inserted by the procedure, but not the other row inserted within the anonymous block.

```
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50,'HR','DENVER');
DECLARE
    PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION;
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO dept VALUES (60,'FINANCE','CHICAGO');
    insert_dept_70;
    COMMIT;
END;
COMMIT;
```

After the final commit at the end of the transaction, the row inserted is the first one from the beginning of the transaction as well as the row inserted at the beginning of the anonymous block. The only insertion rolled back is the one within the procedure.

```
SELECT * FROM dept ORDER by 1;

 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | HR         | DENVER
     60 | FINANCE    | CHICAGO
(6 rows)
```

The following sections now show examples of `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` in a couple of other SPL program types.

***Autonomous Transaction Trigger***

The following example shows the effect of declaring a trigger with `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION`.

The following table is created to log changes to the `emp` table:

```
CREATE TABLE empauditlog (
    audit_date      DATE,
    audit_user      VARCHAR2(20),
    audit_desc      VARCHAR2(20)
);
```

The trigger attached to the `emp` table that inserts these changes into the `empauditlog` table is the following. Note the inclusion of `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` in the declaration section.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER emp_audit_trig
    AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON emp
DECLARE
    PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION;
    v_action        VARCHAR2(20);
BEGIN
    IF INSERTING THEN
        v_action := 'Added employee(s)';
    ELSIF UPDATING THEN
        v_action := 'Updated employee(s)';
    ELSIF DELETING THEN
        v_action := 'Deleted employee(s)';
    END IF;
    INSERT INTO empauditlog VALUES (SYSDATE, USER,
        v_action);
END;
```

The following two inserts are made into the emp table within a transaction started by the BEGIN command.

```
BEGIN;
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (9001,'SMITH','ANALYST',7782,SYSDATE,NULL,NULL,10);
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (9002,'JONES','CLERK',7782,SYSDATE,NULL,NULL,10);
```

The following shows the two new rows in the `emp` table as well as the two entries in the `empauditlog` table:

```
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno > 9000;

 empno | ename |   job   | mgr  |      hiredate      | sal | comm | deptno
-------+-------+---------+------+--------------------+-----+------+--------
  9001 | SMITH | ANALYST | 7782 | 23-AUG-18 07:12:27 |     |      |     10
  9002 | JONES | CLERK   | 7782 | 23-AUG-18 07:12:27 |     |      |     10
(2 rows)

SELECT TO_CHAR(AUDIT_DATE,'DD-MON-YY HH24:MI:SS') AS "audit date",
    audit_user, audit_desc FROM empauditlog ORDER BY 1 ASC;

     audit date     |  audit_user  |    audit_desc

--------------------+--------------+-------------------
 23-AUG-18 07:12:27 | enterprisedb | Added employee(s)
 23-AUG-18 07:12:27 | enterprisedb | Added employee(s)
(2 rows)
```

But then the `ROLLBACK` command is given during this session. The `emp` table no longer contains the two rows, but the `empauditlog` table still contains its two entries as the trigger implicitly performed a commit and `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` commits those changes independent from the rollback given in the calling transaction.

```
ROLLBACK;

SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno > 9000;

 empno | ename | job | mgr | hiredate | sal | comm | deptno
-------+-------+-----+-----+----------+-----+------+--------
(0 rows)

SELECT TO_CHAR(AUDIT_DATE,'DD-MON-YY HH24:MI:SS') AS "audit date",
    audit_user, audit_desc FROM empauditlog ORDER BY 1 ASC;

     audit date     |  audit_user  |    audit_desc

--------------------+--------------+-------------------
 23-AUG-18 07:12:27 | enterprisedb | Added employee(s)
 23-AUG-18 07:12:27 | enterprisedb | Added employee(s)
(2 rows)
```

***Autonomous Transaction Object Type Method***

The following example shows the effect of declaring an object method with `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION`.

The following object type and object type body are created. The member procedure within the object type body contains the `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` in the declaration section along with `COMMIT` at the end of the procedure.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE insert_dept_typ AS OBJECT (
    deptno          NUMBER(2),
    dname           VARCHAR2(14),
    loc             VARCHAR2(13),
    MEMBER PROCEDURE insert_dept
);

CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE BODY insert_dept_typ AS
    MEMBER PROCEDURE insert_dept
    IS
        PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION;
    BEGIN
        INSERT INTO dept VALUES (SELF.deptno,SELF.dname,SELF.loc);
        COMMIT;
    END;
END;
```

In the following anonymous block, an insert is performed into the `dept` table, followed by invocation of the `insert_dept` method of the object, ending with a `ROLLBACK` command in the anonymous block.

```
BEGIN;
DECLARE
    v_dept          INSERT_DEPT_TYP :=
                      insert_dept_typ(60,'FINANCE','CHICAGO');
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50,'HR','DENVER');
    v_dept.insert_dept;
    ROLLBACK;
END;
```

Since `insert_dept` has been declared as an autonomous transaction, its insert of department number 60 remains in the table, but the rollback removes the insertion of department 50.

```
SELECT * FROM dept ORDER BY 1;

 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     60 | FINANCE    | CHICAGO
(5 rows)
```
