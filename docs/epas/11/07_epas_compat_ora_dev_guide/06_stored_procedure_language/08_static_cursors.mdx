Rather than executing a whole query at once, it is possible to set up a *cursor* that encapsulates the query, and then read the query result set one row at a time. This allows the creation of SPL program logic that retrieves a row from the result set, does some processing on the data in that row, and then retrieves the next row and repeats the process.

Cursors are most often used in the context of a `FOR` or `WHILE` loop. A conditional test should be included in the SPL logic that detects when the end of the result set has been reached so the program can exit the loop.

## Declaring a Cursor

In order to use a cursor, it must first be declared in the declaration section of the SPL program. A cursor declaration appears as follows:

> `CURSOR` *`name`* `IS` *`query`*`;`

*`name`* is an identifier that will be used to reference the cursor and its result set later in the program. *`query`* is a SQL `SELECT` command that determines the result set retrievable by the cursor.

**Note:** An extension of this syntax allows the use of parameters. This is discussed in more detail in Section [3.8.8](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/database-compatibility-for-oracle-developers-guide/11/Database_Compatibility_for_Oracle_Developers_Guide.1.077.html#pID0E0PJE0HA).

The following are some examples of cursor declarations:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    CURSOR emp_cur_1 IS SELECT * FROM emp;
    CURSOR emp_cur_2 IS SELECT empno, ename FROM emp;
    CURSOR emp_cur_3 IS SELECT empno, ename FROM emp WHERE deptno = 10
        ORDER BY empno;
BEGIN
    ...
END;
```

## Opening a Cursor

Before a cursor can be used to retrieve rows, it must first be opened. This is accomplished with the `OPEN` statement.

> `OPEN` *`name`*`;`

*`name`* is the identifier of a cursor that has been previously declared in the declaration section of the SPL program. The `OPEN` statement must not be executed on a cursor that has already been, and still is open.

The following shows an `OPEN` statement with its corresponding cursor declaration.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    CURSOR emp_cur_3 IS SELECT empno, ename FROM emp WHERE deptno = 10
        ORDER BY empno;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_3;
        ...
END;
```

## Fetching Rows From a Cursor

Once a cursor has been opened, rows can be retrieved from the cursorâ€™s result set by using the `FETCH` statement.

> `FETCH` *`name`* `INTO` `{` *`record`* `|` *`variable`* `[,` *`variable_2`* `]... };`

*`name`* is the identifier of a previously opened cursor. *`record`* is the identifier of a previously defined record (for example, using *`table`*`%ROWTYPE`). *`variable`*, *`variable_2`*... are SPL variables that will receive the field data from the fetched row. The fields in *`record`* or *`variable`*, *`variable_2`*... must match in number and order, the fields returned in the `SELECT` list of the query given in the cursor declaration. The data types of the fields in the `SELECT` list must match, or be implicitly convertible to the data types of the fields in *`record`* or the data types of *`variable`*, *`variable_2`*...

**Note:** There is a variation of `FETCH INTO` using the `BULK COLLECT` clause that can return multiple rows at a time into a collection. See Section [3.12.4](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/database-compatibility-for-oracle-developers-guide/11/Database_Compatibility_for_Oracle_Developers_Guide.1.081.html#pID0E05CD0HA) for more information on using the `BULK COLLECT` clause with the `FETCH INTO` statement.

The following shows the `FETCH` statement.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    v_empno         NUMBER(4);
    v_ename         VARCHAR2(10);
    CURSOR emp_cur_3 IS SELECT empno, ename FROM emp WHERE deptno = 10
        ORDER BY empno;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_3;
    FETCH emp_cur_3 INTO v_empno, v_ename;
        ...
END;
```

Instead of explicitly declaring the data type of a target variable, `%TYPE` can be used instead. In this way, if the data type of the database column is changed, the target variable declaration in the SPL program does not have to be changed. `%TYPE` will automatically pick up the new data type of the specified column.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    v_empno         emp.empno%TYPE;
    v_ename         emp.ename%TYPE;
    CURSOR emp_cur_3 IS SELECT empno, ename FROM emp WHERE deptno = 10
        ORDER BY empno;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_3;
    FETCH emp_cur_3 INTO v_empno, v_ename;
        ...
END;
```

If all the columns in a table are retrieved in the order defined in the table, `%ROWTYPE` can be used to define a record into which the `FETCH` statement will place the retrieved data. Each field within the record can then be accessed using dot notation.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    v_emp_rec       emp%ROWTYPE;
    CURSOR emp_cur_1 IS SELECT * FROM emp;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_1;
    FETCH emp_cur_1 INTO v_emp_rec;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee Number: ' || v_emp_rec.empno);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee Name  : ' || v_emp_rec.ename);
        ...
END;
```

## Closing a Cursor

Once all the desired rows have been retrieved from the cursor result set, the cursor must be closed. Once closed, the result set is no longer accessible. The `CLOSE` statement appears as follows:

`CLOSE` *`name`*`;`

*`name`* is the identifier of a cursor that is currently open. Once a cursor is closed, it must not be closed again. However, once the cursor is closed, the `OPEN` statement can be issued again on the closed cursor and the query result set will be rebuilt after which the `FETCH` statement can then be used to retrieve the rows of the new result set.

The following example illustrates the use of the `CLOSE` statement:

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    v_emp_rec       emp%ROWTYPE;
    CURSOR emp_cur_1 IS SELECT * FROM emp;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_1;
    FETCH emp_cur_1 INTO v_emp_rec;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee Number: ' || v_emp_rec.empno);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee Name  : ' || v_emp_rec.ename);
    CLOSE emp_cur_1;
END;
```

This procedure produces the following output when invoked. Employee number `7369`, `SMITH` is the first row of the result set.

```
EXEC cursor_example;

Employee Number: 7369
Employee Name  : SMITH
```

## Using %ROWTYPE With Cursors

Using the `%ROWTYPE` attribute, a record can be defined that contains fields corresponding to all columns fetched from a cursor or cursor variable. Each field takes on the data type of its corresponding column. The `%ROWTYPE` attribute is prefixed by a cursor name or cursor variable name.

> *`record`* *`cursor`*`%ROWTYPE;`

*`record`* is an identifier assigned to the record. *`cursor`* is an explicitly declared cursor within the current scope.

The following example shows how you can use a cursor with `%ROWTYPE` to get information about which employee works in which department.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE emp_info
IS
    CURSOR empcur IS SELECT ename, deptno FROM emp;
    myvar           empcur%ROWTYPE;
BEGIN
    OPEN empcur;
    LOOP
        FETCH empcur INTO myvar;
        EXIT WHEN empcur%NOTFOUND;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE( myvar.ename || ' works in department '
            || myvar.deptno );
    END LOOP;
    CLOSE empcur;
END;
```

The following is the output from this procedure.

```
EXEC emp_info;

SMITH works in department 20
ALLEN works in department 30
WARD works in department 30
JONES works in department 20
MARTIN works in department 30
BLAKE works in department 30
CLARK works in department 10
SCOTT works in department 20
KING works in department 10
TURNER works in department 30
ADAMS works in department 20
JAMES works in department 30
FORD works in department 20
MILLER works in department 10
```

## Cursor Attributes

Each cursor has a set of attributes associated with it that allows the program to test the state of the cursor. These attributes are `%ISOPEN`, `%FOUND`, `%NOTFOUND`, and `%ROWCOUNT`. These attributes are described in the following sections.

### %ISOPEN

The `%ISOPEN` attribute is used to test whether or not a cursor is open.

> *`cursor_name`*`%ISOPEN`

*`cursor_name`* is the name of the cursor for which a `BOOLEAN` data type of `TRUE` will be returned if the cursor is open, `FALSE` otherwise.

The following is an example of using `%ISOPEN`.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
        ...
    CURSOR emp_cur_1 IS SELECT * FROM emp;
        ...
BEGIN
        ...
    IF emp_cur_1%ISOPEN THEN
        NULL;
    ELSE
        OPEN emp_cur_1;
    END IF;
    FETCH emp_cur_1 INTO ...
        ...
END;
```

### %FOUND

The `%FOUND` attribute is used to test whether or not a row is retrieved from the result set of the specified cursor after a `FETCH` on the cursor.

> *`cursor_name`*`%FOUND`

*`cursor_name`* is the name of the cursor for which a `BOOLEAN` data type of `TRUE` will be returned if a row is retrieved from the result set of the cursor after a `FETCH`.

After the last row of the result set has been `FETCH`ed the next `FETCH` results in `%FOUND` returning `FALSE`. `FALSE` is also returned after the first `FETCH` if there are no rows in the result set to begin with.

Referencing `%FOUND` on a cursor before it is opened or after it is closed results in an `INVALID_CURSOR` exception being thrown.

`%FOUND` returns `null` if it is referenced when the cursor is open, but before the first `FETCH`.

The following example uses `%FOUND`.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    v_emp_rec       emp%ROWTYPE;
    CURSOR emp_cur_1 IS SELECT * FROM emp;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_1;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('EMPNO    ENAME');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('-----    -------');
    FETCH emp_cur_1 INTO v_emp_rec;
    WHILE emp_cur_1%FOUND LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_emp_rec.empno || '     ' || v_emp_rec.ename);
        FETCH emp_cur_1 INTO v_emp_rec;
    END LOOP;
    CLOSE emp_cur_1;
END;
```

When the previous procedure is invoked, the output appears as follows:

```
EXEC cursor_example;

EMPNO    ENAME

-----    ------

7369     SMITH
7499     ALLEN
7521     WARD
7566     JONES
7654     MARTIN
7698     BLAKE
7782     CLARK
7788     SCOTT
7839     KING
7844     TURNER
7876     ADAMS
7900     JAMES
7902     FORD
7934     MILLER
```

### %NOTFOUND

The `%NOTFOUND` attribute is the logical opposite of `%FOUND`.

*`cursor_name`*`%NOTFOUND`

*`cursor_name`* is the name of the cursor for which a `BOOLEAN` data type of `FALSE` will be returned if a row is retrieved from the result set of the cursor after a `FETCH`.

After the last row of the result set has been `FETCH`ed the next `FETCH` results in `%NOTFOUND` returning `TRUE`. `TRUE` is also returned after the first `FETCH` if there are no rows in the result set to begin with.

Referencing `%NOTFOUND` on a cursor before it is opened or after it is closed, results in an INVALID_CURSOR exception being thrown.

`%NOTFOUND` returns null if it is referenced when the cursor is open, but before the first `FETCH`.

The following example uses `%NOTFOUND`.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    v_emp_rec       emp%ROWTYPE;
    CURSOR emp_cur_1 IS SELECT * FROM emp;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_1;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('EMPNO    ENAME');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('-----    -------');
    LOOP
        FETCH emp_cur_1 INTO v_emp_rec;
        EXIT WHEN emp_cur_1%NOTFOUND;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_emp_rec.empno || '     ' || v_emp_rec.ename);
    END LOOP;
    CLOSE emp_cur_1;
END;
```

Similar to the prior example, this procedure produces the same output when invoked.

```
EXEC cursor_example;

EMPNO    ENAME

-----    ------

7369     SMITH
7499     ALLEN
7521     WARD
7566     JONES
7654     MARTIN
7698     BLAKE
7782     CLARK
7788     SCOTT
7839     KING
7844     TURNER
7876     ADAMS
7900     JAMES
7902     FORD
7934     MILLER
```

### %ROWCOUNT

The `%ROWCOUNT` attribute returns an integer showing the number of rows `FETCH`ed so far from the specified cursor.

> *`cursor_name`*`%ROWCOUNT`

*`cursor_name`* is the name of the cursor for which `%ROWCOUNT` returns the number of rows retrieved thus far. After the last row has been retrieved, `%ROWCOUNT` remains set to the total number of rows returned until the cursor is closed at which point `%ROWCOUNT` will throw an `INVALID_CURSOR` exception if referenced.

Referencing `%ROWCOUNT` on a cursor before it is opened or after it is closed, results in an `INVALID_CURSOR` exception being thrown.

`%ROWCOUNT` returns `0` if it is referenced when the cursor is open, but before the first FETC~H. `%ROWCOUNT` also returns `0` after the first `FETCH` when there are no rows in the result set to begin with.

The following example uses `%ROWCOUNT`.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    v_emp_rec       emp%ROWTYPE;
    CURSOR emp_cur_1 IS SELECT * FROM emp;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_1;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('EMPNO    ENAME');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('-----    -------');
    LOOP
        FETCH emp_cur_1 INTO v_emp_rec;
        EXIT WHEN emp_cur_1%NOTFOUND;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_emp_rec.empno || '     ' || v_emp_rec.ename);
    END LOOP;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('**********************');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(emp_cur_1%ROWCOUNT || ' rows were retrieved');
    CLOSE emp_cur_1;
END;
```

This procedure prints the total number of rows retrieved at the end of the employee list as follows:

```
EXEC cursor_example;

EMPNO    ENAME

-----    -------

7369     SMITH
7499     ALLEN
7521     WARD
7566     JONES
7654     MARTIN
7698     BLAKE
7782     CLARK
7788     SCOTT
7839     KING
7844     TURNER
7876     ADAMS
7900     JAMES
7902     FORD
7934     MILLER

**********************

14 rows were retrieved
```

### Summary of Cursor States and Attributes

The following table summarizes the possible cursor states and the values returned by the cursor attributes.

**Table 3â€‘3 Cursor Attributes**

| Cursor State                                | %ISOPEN | %FOUND                     | %NOTFOUND                  | %ROWCOUNT                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Before `OPEN`                               | False   | `INVALID_CURSOR` Exception | `INVALID_CURSOR` Exception | `INVALID_CURSOR` Exception |
| After `OPEN` & Before 1st `FETCH`           | True    | Null                       | Null                       | 0                          |
| After 1st Successful `FETCH`                | True    | True                       | False                      | 1                          |
| After *`n`*th Successful `FETCH` (last row) | True    | True                       | False                      | n                          |
| After *`n`*+1st `FETCH` (after last row)    | True    | False                      | True                       | n                          |
| After `CLOSE`                               | False   | `INVALID_CURSOR` Exception | `INVALID_CURSOR` Exception | `INVALID_CURSOR` Exception |

## Cursor FOR Loop

In the cursor examples presented so far, the programming logic required to process the result set of a cursor included a statement to open the cursor, a loop construct to retrieve each row of the result set, a test for the end of the result set, and finally a statement to close the cursor. The *cursor FOR loop* is a loop construct that eliminates the need to individually code the statements just listed.

The cursor `FOR` loop opens a previously declared cursor, fetches all rows in the cursor result set, and then closes the cursor.

The syntax for creating a cursor `FOR` loop is as follows.

> `FOR` *`record`* `IN` *`cursor`*
>
> `LOOP`
>
>  *`statements`*
>
> `END LOOP;`

*`record`* is an identifier assigned to an implicitly declared record with definition, *`cursor`*`%ROWTYPE`. *`cursor`* is the name of a previously declared cursor. *`statements`* are one or more SPL statements. There must be at least one statement.

The following example shows the example from Section [3.8.6.3](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/database-compatibility-for-oracle-developers-guide/11/Database_Compatibility_for_Oracle_Developers_Guide.1.077.html#pID0E0VNE0HA), modified to use a cursor `FOR` loop.

```
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    CURSOR emp_cur_1 IS SELECT * FROM emp;
BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('EMPNO    ENAME');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('-----    -------');
    FOR v_emp_rec IN emp_cur_1 LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_emp_rec.empno || '     ' || v_emp_rec.ename);
    END LOOP;
END;
```

The same results are achieved as shown in the output below.

```
EXEC cursor_example;

EMPNO    ENAME

-----    -------

7369     SMITH
7499     ALLEN
7521     WARD
7566     JONES
7654     MARTIN
7698     BLAKE
7782     CLARK
7788     SCOTT
7839     KING
7844     TURNER
7876     ADAMS
7900     JAMES
7902     FORD
7934     MILLER
```

## Parameterized Cursors

A user can also declare a static cursor that accepts parameters, and can pass values for those parameters when opening that cursor. In the following example we have created a parameterized cursor which will display the name and salary of all employees from the `emp` table that have a salary less than a specified value which is passed as a parameter.

```
DECLARE
    my_record       emp%ROWTYPE;
    CURSOR c1 (max_wage NUMBER) IS
        SELECT * FROM emp WHERE sal < max_wage;
BEGIN
    OPEN c1(2000);
    LOOP
        FETCH c1 INTO my_record;
        EXIT WHEN c1%NOTFOUND;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Name = ' || my_record.ename || ', salary = '
            || my_record.sal);
    END LOOP;
    CLOSE c1;
END;
```

So for example if we pass the value 2000 as `max_wage`, then we will only be shown the name and salary of all employees that have a salary less than 2000. The result of the above query is the following:

```
Name = SMITH, salary = 800.00
Name = ALLEN, salary = 1600.00
Name = WARD, salary = 1250.00
Name = MARTIN, salary = 1250.00
Name = TURNER, salary = 1500.00
Name = ADAMS, salary = 1100.00
Name = JAMES, salary = 950.00
Name = MILLER, salary = 1300.00
```
