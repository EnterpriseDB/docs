This section discusses the basic programming elements of an SPL program.

## Character Set

SPL programs are written using the following set of characters:

- Uppercase letters `A` thru `Z` and lowercase letters a thru z
- Digits `0` thru `9`
- Symbols `( ) + - * / < > = ! ~ ^ ; : . ' @ % , " # $ & _ | { } ? [ ]`
- White space characters tabs, spaces, and carriage returns

Identifiers, expressions, statements, control structures, etc. that comprise the SPL language are written using these characters.

**Note:** The data that can be manipulated by an SPL program is determined by the character set supported by the database encoding.

## Case Sensitivity

Keywords and user-defined identifiers that are used in an SPL program are case insensitive. So for example, the statement `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello World');` is interpreted to mean the same thing as `dbms_output.put_line``('Hello World');` or `Dbms_Output.Put_Line('Hello World');` or `DBMS_output.Put_line('Hello World');`.

Character and string constants, however, are case sensitive as well as any data retrieved from the Advanced Server database or data obtained from other external sources. The statement `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello World!');` produces the following output:

Hello World!

However the statement `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('HELLO WORLD!');` produces the output:

```
HELLO WORLD!
```

## Identifiers

*Identifiers* are user-defined names that are used to identify various elements of an SPL program including variables, cursors, labels, programs, and parameters. The syntax rules for valid identifiers are the same as for identifiers in the SQL language.

An identifier must not be the same as an SPL keyword or a keyword of the SQL language. The following are some examples of valid identifiers:

```
x
last___name
a_$_Sign
Many$$$$$$$$signs_____
THIS_IS_AN_EXTREMELY_LONG_NAME
A1
```

## Qualifiers

A *qualifier* is a name that specifies the owner or context of an entity that is the object of the qualification. A qualified object is specified as the qualifier name followed by a dot with no intervening white space, followed by the name of the object being qualified with no intervening white space. This syntax is called *dot notation*.

The following is the syntax of a qualified object.

> *`qualifier`*`. [` *`qualifier`*`. ]...` *`object`*

*`qualifier`* is the name of the owner of the object. *`object`* is the name of the entity belonging to *`qualifier`*. It is possible to have a chain of qualifications where the preceding qualifier owns the entity identified by the subsequent qualifier(s) and object.

Almost any identifier can be qualified. What an identifier is qualified by depends upon what the identifier represents and the context of its usage.

Some examples of qualification follow:

- Procedure and function names qualified by the schema to which they belong - e.g., `schema_name.procedure_name(...)`
- Trigger names qualified by the schema to which they belong - e.g., `schema_name.trigger_name`
- Column names qualified by the table to which they belong - e.g., `emp.empno`
- Table names qualified by the schema to which they belong - e.g., `public.emp`
- Column names qualified by table and schema - e.g., `public.emp.empno`

As a general rule, wherever a name appears in the syntax of an SPL statement, its qualified name can be used as well. Typically a qualified name would only be used if there is some ambiguity associated with the name. For example, if two procedures with the same name belonging to two different schemas are invoked from within a program or if the same name is used for a table column and SPL variable within the same program.

You should avoid using qualified names if at all possible. In this chapter, the following conventions are adopted to avoid naming conflicts:

- All variables declared in the declaration section of an SPL program are prefixed by v_. E.g., `v_empno`
- _All formal parameters declared in a procedure or function definition are prefixed by p_. E.g., `p_empno`
- Column names and table names do not have any special prefix conventions. E.g., column `empno` in table `emp`

## Constants

*Constants* or *literals* are fixed values that can be used in SPL programs to represent values of various types - e.g., numbers, strings, dates, etc. Constants come in the following types:

- Numeric (Integer and Real)
- Character and String
- Date/time

## User-Defined PL/SQL Subtypes

Advanced Server supports user-defined PL/SQL subtypes and (subtype) aliases. A subtype is a data type with an optional set of constraints that restrict the values that can be stored in a column of that type. The rules that apply to the type on which the subtype is based are still enforced, but you can use additional constraints to place limits on the precision or scale of values stored in the type.

You can define a subtype in the declaration of a PL function, procedure, anonymous block or package. The syntax is:

> `SUBTYPE` *`subtype_name`* `IS` *`type_name`*`[(`*`constraint`*`)] [NOT NULL]`

Where *`constraint`* is:

`{`*`precision`* `[,` *`scale`*`]} |` *`length`*

Where:

*`subtype_name`*

> *`subtype_name`* specifies the name of the subtype.

*`type_name`*

> *`type_name`* specifies the name of the original type on which the subtype is based. *`type_name`* may be:
>
> - The name of any of the type supported by Advanced Server.
> - The name of any composite type.
> - A column anchored by a %TYPE operator.
> - The name of another subtype.

Include the *`constraint`* clause to define restrictions for types that support precision or scale.

*`precision`*

> *`precision`* specifies the total number of digits permitted in a value of the subtype.

*`scale`*

> *`scale`* specifies the number of fractional digits permitted in a value of the subtype.

*`length`*

> *`length`* specifies the total length permitted in a value of `CHARACTER`, `VARCHAR`, or `TEXT` base types

Include the `NOT NULL` clause to specify that `NULL` values may not be stored in a column of the specified subtype.

Note that a subtype that is based on a column will inherit the column size constraints, but the subtype will not inherit `NOT NULL` or `CHECK` constraints.

**Unconstrained Subtypes**

To create an unconstrained subtype, use the `SUBTYPE` command to specify the new subtype name and the name of the type on which the subtype is based. For example, the following command creates a subtype named address that has all of the attributes of the type, `CHAR`:

> `SUBTYPE address IS CHAR;`

You can also create a subtype (constrained or unconstrained) that is a subtype of another subtype:

> `SUBTYPE cust_address IS address NOT NULL;`

This command creates a subtype named `cust_address` that shares all of the attributes of the `address` subtype. Include the `NOT NULL` clause to specify that a value of the `cust_address` may not be `NULL`.

**Constrained Subtypes**

Include a *`length`* value when creating a subtype that is based on a character type to define the maximum length of the subtype. For example:

> `SUBTYPE acct_name IS VARCHAR (15);`

This example creates a subtype named `acct_name` that is based on a `VARCHAR` data type, but is limited to 15 characters in length.

Include values for *`precision`* (to specify the maximum number of digits in a value of the subtype) and optionally, *`scale`* (to specify the number of digits to the right of the decimal point) when constraining a numeric base type. For example:

> `SUBTYPE acct_balance IS NUMBER (5, 2);`

This example creates a subtype named `acct_balance` that shares all of the attributes of a `NUMBER` type, but that may not exceed 3 digits to the left of the decimal point and 2 digits to the right of the decimal.

An argument declaration (in a function or procedure header) is a *formal* *argument*. The value passed to a function or procedure is an *actual* *argument*. When invoking a function or procedure, the caller provides (0 or more) actual arguments. Each actual argument is assigned to a formal argument that holds the value within the body of the function or procedure.

If a formal argument is declared as a constrained subtype:

- Advanced Server does not enforce subtype constraints when assigning an actual argument to a formal argument when invoking a function.
- Advanced Server enforces subtype constraints when assigning an actual argument to a formal argument when invoking a procedure.

**Using the %TYPE Operator**

You can use `%TYPE` notation to declare a subtype anchored to a column. For example:

> `SUBTYPE emp_type IS emp.empno%TYPE`

This command creates a subtype named `emp_type` whose base type matches the type of the `empno` column in the `emp` table. A subtype that is based on a column will share the column size constraints; `NOT NULL` and `CHECK` constraints are not inherited.

**Subtype Conversion**

Unconstrained subtypes are aliases for the type on which they are based. Any variable of type subtype (unconstrained) is interchangeable with a variable of the base type without conversion, and vice versa.

A variable of a constrained subtype may be interchanged with a variable of the base type without conversion, but a variable of the base type may only be interchanged with a constrained subtype if it complies with the constraints of the subtype. A variable of a constrained subtype may be implicitly converted to another subtype if it is based on the same subtype, and the constraint values are within the values of the subtype to which it is being converted.
