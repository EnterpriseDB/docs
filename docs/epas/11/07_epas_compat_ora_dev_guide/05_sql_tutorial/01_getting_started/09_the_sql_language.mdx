Advanced Server supports SQL language that is compatible with Oracle syntax as well as syntax and commands for extended functionality (functionality that does not provide database compatibility for Oracle or support Oracle-styled applications).

The Reference Guide that supports the Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's Guide provides detailed information about:

- Compatible SQL syntax and language elements
- Data types
- Supported SQL command syntax
