Please note: StackBuilder Plus is supported only on Windows systems.

The StackBuilder Plus utility provides a graphical interface that simplifies the process of updating, downloading, and installing modules that complement your Advanced Server installation. When you install a module with StackBuilder Plus, StackBuilder Plus automatically resolves any software dependencies.

You can invoke StackBuilder Plus at any time after the installation has completed by selecting the `StackBuilder Plus` menu option from the `Apps` menu. Enter your system password (if prompted), and the StackBuilder Plus welcome window opens (shown in Figure 6.1).

Use the drop-down listbox on the welcome window to select your Advanced Server installation.

StackBuilder Plus requires Internet access; if your installation of Advanced Server resides behind a firewall (with restricted Internet access), StackBuilder Plus can download program installers through a proxy server. The module provider determines if the module can be accessed through an HTTP proxy or an FTP proxy; currently, all updates are transferred via an HTTP proxy and the FTP proxy information is not used.

If the selected Advanced Server installation has restricted Internet access, use the `Proxy Servers` on the `Welcome` window to open the `Proxy servers` dialog (shown in Figure 6.2).

Enter the IP address and port number of the proxy server in the `HTTP proxy` on the `Proxy servers` dialog. Currently, all StackBuilder Plus modules are distributed via HTTP proxy (FTP proxy information is ignored). Click OK to continue.

The tree control on the StackBuilder Plus module selection window (shown in Figure 6.3) displays a node for each module category. To perform an Advanced Server update, expand the `Database Serve`r module in the tree control and check the box to the left of the Advanced Server upgraded version. Then, click `Next`.

If prompted, enter your email address and password on the StackBuilder Plus registration window (shown in Figure 6.4).

<center><i>Figure 6.5 -A summary window displays a list of selected packages.</i></center>

StackBuilder Plus confirms the packages selected (Figure 6.5). The `Selected packages` dialog will display the name and version of the installer; click `Next` to continue.

When the download completes, a window opens that confirms the installation files have been downloaded and are ready for installation (see Figure 6.6).

You can check the box next to `Skip Installation`, and select `Next` to exit StackBuilder Plus without installing the downloaded files, or leave the box unchecked and click `Next` to start the installation process.

When the upgrade is complete, StackBuilder Plus will alert you to the success or failure of the installation of the requested package (see Figure 6.7). If you were prompted by an installer to restart your computer, reboot now.

Please note: If the update fails to install, StackBuilder Plus will alert you to the installation error with a popup dialog and write a message to the log file at `%TEMP%`.
