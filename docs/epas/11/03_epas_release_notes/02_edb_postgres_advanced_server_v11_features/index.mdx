EnterpriseDB features added for Advanced Server Version 11 include:

- Advanced Server no longer creates the `dbo` system catalog in its databases.
- Advanced Server now supports data redaction. Data redaction is a technique for limiting the exposure of sensitive data to certain users. Data redaction results in the alteration of the displayed data to such users. This is accomplished by defining redaction policies for tables with sensitive data.
- You can use the `edb_filter_log.redact_password_commands` extension to instruct the server to redact stored passwords from the log file.
- Advanced Server now supports EDB wait states, which is a background worker that probes each running session at a regular interval collecting information such as the database connection, the logged in user, the running query, and the wait events.
- Advanced Server now permits an infinite number of tries for custom plan generation if you set the `edb_custom_plan_tries` parameter to `-1`.
- The output format of the version() function has been changed to appear more consistent with the PostgreSQL community version output.
- Advanced Server now supports SPL standalone procedure overloading. Note that this feature is not compatible with Oracle databases.
- Advanced Server now supports the `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` directive within any SPL block to provide the autonomous transaction capability.
- Advanced server now offers performance improvements to libpq dblink and the OCI.
