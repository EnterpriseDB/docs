This section describes the database server configuration parameters of Advanced Server. These parameters control various aspects of the database serverâ€™s behavior and environment such as data file and log file locations, connection, authentication, and security settings, resource allocation and consumption, archiving and replication settings, error logging and statistics gathering, optimization and performance tuning, locale and formatting settings, and so on.

Most of these configuration parameters apply to PostgreSQL as well. Configuration parameters that apply only to Advanced Server are noted in Section [3.1.2](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/user-guide/11/EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_Guide.1.022.html#pID0E05WF0HA).

Additional information about configuration parameters can be found in the PostgreSQL Core Documentation available at:
