This section describes the configuration parameters used for planner method configuration.

## edb_custom_plan_tries

**Parameter Type:** Integer

**Default Value:** 5

**Range:** -1 to 100

**Minimum Scope of Effect:** Per session

**When Value Changes Take Effect:** Immediate

**Required Authorization to Activate:** Session User

This configuration parameter controls the number of custom execution plans considered by the planner before the planner settles on a generic execution plan.

When a client application repeatedly executes a prepared statement, the server may decide to evaluate several execution plans before deciding to choose a *custom* plan or a *generic* plan.

- A custom plan is a plan built for a specific set of parameter values.
- A generic plan is a plan that will work with any set of parameter values supplied by the client application.

By default, the optimizer will generate five custom plans before evaluating a generic plan. That means that if you execute a prepared statement six times, the optimizer will generate five custom plans, then one generic plan, and then decide whether to stick with the generic plan.

In certain workloads, this extra planning can have a negative impact on performance. You can adjust the `edb_custom_plan_tries` configuration parameter to decrease the number of custom plans considered before evaluating a generic plan.

Setting `edb_custom_plan_tries` to 0 will effectively disable custom plan generation.

Setting `edb_custom_plan_tries` to -1 allows custom plan generation for an infinite number of tries.

Consider the following query:

`PREPARE custQuery AS SELECT * FROM customer WHERE salesman >= $1`

The $1 token in this query is a parameter marker - the client application must provide a value for each parameter marker each time the statement executes.

If an index has been defined on `customer.salesman`, the optimizer may choose to execute this query using a sequential scan, or using an index scan. In some cases, an index is faster than a sequential scan; in other cases, the sequential scan will win. The optimal plan will depend on the distribution of salesman values in the table and on the search value (the value provided for the $1 parameter).

When the client application repeatedly executes the `custQuery` prepared statement, the optimizer will generate some number of parameter-value-specific execution plans (custom plans), followed by a generic plan (a plan that ignores the parameter values), and then decide whether to stick with the generic plan or to continue to generate custom plans for each execution. The decision process takes into account not only the cost of executing the plans, but the cost of generating custom plans as well.

## edb_enable_pruning

**Parameter Type:** Boolean

**Default Value:** `true`

**Range:** {`true | false`}

**Minimum Scope of Effect:** Per session

**When Value Changes Take Effect:** Immediate

**Required Authorization to Activate:** Session user

When set to `TRUE`, `edb_enable_pruning` allows the query planner to early-prune partitioned tables. *Early-pruning* means that the query planner can “prune” (i.e., ignore) partitions that would not be searched in a query *before* generating query plans. This helps improve performance time as it eliminates the generation of query plans of partitions that would not be searched.

Conversely, *late-pruning* means that the query planner prunes partitions *after* generating query plans for each partition. (The `constraint_exclusion` configuration parameter controls late-pruning.)

The ability to early-prune depends upon the nature of the query in the WHERE clause. Early-pruning can be utilized in only simple queries with constraints of the type `WHERE` *`column`* `=` *literal* (e.g., `WHERE deptno = 10`).

Early-pruning is not used for more complex queries such as `WHERE` *`column`* `=` *`expression`* (e.g., `WHERE deptno = 10 + 5`).
