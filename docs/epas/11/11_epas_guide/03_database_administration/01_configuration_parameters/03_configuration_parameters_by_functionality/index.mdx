This section provides more detail for certain groups of configuration parameters.

The section heading for each parameter is followed by a list of attributes:

- **Parameter Type.** Type of values the parameter can accept. See Section [3.1.1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/user-guide/11/EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_Guide.1.021.html#pID0E0XXF0HA) for a discussion of parameter type values.
- **Default Value.** Default setting if a value is not explicitly set in the configuration file.
- **Range.** Permitted range of values.
- **Minimum Scope of Effect.** Smallest scope for which a distinct setting can be made. Generally, the minimal scope of a distinct setting is either the entire **cluster** (the setting is the same for all databases and sessions thereof, in the cluster), or **per session** (the setting may vary by role, database, or individual session). (This attribute has the same meaning as the “Scope of Effect” column in the table of Section 2.1.2.)
- **When Value Changes Take Effect.** Least invasive action required to activate a change to a parameter’s value. All parameter setting changes made in the configuration file can be put into effect with a restart of the database server; however certain parameters require a database server **restart**. Some parameter setting changes can be put into effect with a **reload** of the configuration file without stopping the database server. Finally, other parameter setting changes can be put into effect with some client side action whose result is **immediate**. (This attribute has the same meaning as the “When Takes Effect” column in the table of Section 2.1.2.)
- **Required Authorization to Activate.** The type of user authorization to activate a change to a parameter’s setting. If a database server restart or a configuration file reload is required, then the user must be a EPAS service account (`enterprisedb` or `postgres` depending upon the Advanced Server compatibility installation mode). This attribute has the same meaning as the “Authorized User” column in the table of Section 2.1.2.
