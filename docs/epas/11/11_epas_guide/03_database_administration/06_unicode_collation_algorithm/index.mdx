The *Unicode Collation Algorithm* (UCA) is a specification (*Unicode Technical Report #10*) that defines a customizable method of collating and comparing Unicode data. *Collation* means how data is sorted as with a `SELECT â€¦ ORDER BY` clause. *Comparison* is relevant for searches that use ranges with less than, greater than, or equal to operators.

Customizability is an important factor for various reasons such as the following.

- Unicode supports a vast number of languages. Letters that may be common to several languages may be expected to collate in different orders depending upon the language.
- Characters that appear with letters in certain languages such as accents or umlauts have an impact on the expected collation depending upon the language.
- In some languages, combinations of several consecutive characters should be treated as a single character with regards to its collation sequence.
- There may be certain preferences as to the collation of letters according to case. For example, should the lowercase form of a letter collate before the uppercase form of the same letter or vice versa.
- There may be preferences as to whether punctuation marks such as underscore characters, hyphens, or space characters should be considered in the collating sequence or should they simply be ignored as if they did not exist in the string.

Given all of these variations with the vast number of languages supported by Unicode, there is a necessity for a method to select the specific criteria for determining a collating sequence. This is what the Unicode Collation Algorithm defines.

**Note:** In addition, another advantage for using ICU collations (the implementation of the Unicode Collation Algorithm) is for performance. Sorting tasks, including B-tree index creation, can complete in less than half the time it takes with a non-ICU collation. The exact performance gain depends on your operating system version, the language of your text data, and other factors.

The following sections provide a brief, simplified explanation of the Unified Collation Algorithm concepts. As the algorithm and its usage are quite complex with numerous variations, refer to the official documents cited in these sections for complete details.
