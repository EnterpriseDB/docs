Several extensions along with the PL/Perl language must be installed on any database to be used as the source or target database by an EDB Clone Schema function.

In addition, some configuration parameters in the `postgresql.conf` file of the database servers may benefit from some modification.

The following is the setup instructions for these requirements.

## Installing Extensions and PL/Perl

The following describes the steps to install the required extensions and the PL/Perl language.

**These steps must be performed on any database to be used as the source or target database by an EDB Clone Schema function.**

**Step 1:** The following extensions must be installed on the database:

- `postgres_fdw`
- `dblink`
- `adminpack`
- `pgagent`

Ensure that pgAgent is installed before creating the pgagent extension. On Linux, you can use the `edb-as`*`xx`*`-pgagent` RPM package where *xx* is the Advanced Server version number to install pgAgent. On Windows, use StackBuilder Plus to download and install pgAgent.

The previously listed extensions can be installed by the following commands if they do not already exist:

> `CREATE EXTENSION postgres_fdw SCHEMA public;`
> `CREATE EXTENSION dblink SCHEMA public;`
> `CREATE EXTENSION adminpack;`
> `CREATE EXTENSION pgagent;`

For more information about using the `CREATE EXTENSION` command, see the PostgreSQL core documentation at:

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/sql-createextension.html

**Step 2:** Modify the `postgresql.conf` file.

Modify the `postgresql.conf` file by adding `$libdir/parallel_clone` to the `shared_preload_libraries` configuration parameter as shown by the following example:

```
shared_preload_libraries = '$libdir/dbms_pipe,$libdir/dbms_aq,$libdir/parallel_clone'
```

**Step 3:** The Perl Procedural Language (PL/Perl) must be installed on the database and the `CREATE TRUSTED LANGUAGE plperl` command must be run. For Linux, install PL/Perl using the edb-as*xx*-`server-plperl` RPM package where *xx* is the Advanced Server version number. For Windows, use the EDB Postgres Language Pack. For information on EDB Language Pack, see the *EDB Postgres Language Pack Guide* available at:

https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/product-documentation

**Step 4:** Connect to the database as a superuser and run the following command:

> `CREATE TRUSTED LANGUAGE plperl;`

For more information about using the `CREATE LANGUAGE` command, see the PostgreSQL core documentation at:

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/sql-createlanguage.html

## Setting Configuration Parameters

The following sections describe certain configuration parameters that may need to be altered in the `postgresql.conf` file.

### Performance Configuration Parameters

You may need to tune the system for copying a large schema as part of one transaction.

Tuning of configuration parameters is for the source database server referenced in a cloning function.

The configuration parameters in the `postgresql.conf` file that may need to be tuned include the following:

- **work_mem.** Specifies the amount of memory to be used by internal sort operations and hash tables before writing to temporary disk files.
- **maintenance_work_mem.** Specifies the maximum amount of memory to be used by maintenance operations, such as `VACUUM`, `CREATE INDEX`, and `ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY`.
- **max_worker_processes.** Sets the maximum number of background processes that the system can support.
- **checkpoint_timeout.** Maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints, in seconds.
- **checkpoint_completion_target.** Specifies the target of checkpoint completion, as a fraction of total time between checkpoints.
- **checkpoint_flush_after.** Whenever more than `checkpoint_flush_after` *`bytes`* have been written while performing a checkpoint, attempt to force the OS to issue these writes to the underlying storage.
- **max_wal_size.** Maximum size to let the WAL grow to between automatic WAL checkpoints.
- **max_locks_per_transaction.** This parameter controls the average number of object locks allocated for each transaction; individual transactions can lock more objects as long as the locks of all transactions fit in the lock table.

For information about the configuration parameters, see the PostgreSQL core documentation at:

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/runtime-config.html

### Status Logging

Status logging by the cloning functions creates log files in the directory specified by the `log_directory` parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file for the database server to which you are connected when invoking the cloning function.

The default location is `PGDATA/log` as shown by the following:

```
#log_directory = 'log'        # directory where log files are written,
                              # can be absolute or relative to PGDATA
```

This directory must exist prior to running a cloning function.

The name of the log file is determined by what you specify in the parameter list when invoking the cloning function.

To display the status from a log file, use the `process_status_from_log` function as described in Section [9.2.5](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/user-guide/11/EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_Guide.1.080.html#pID0E01K0HA).

To delete a log file, use the `remove_log_file_and_job` function as described in Section [9.2.6](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/user-guide/11/EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_Guide.1.080.html#pID0E0IK0HA), or simply navigate to the log directory and delete it manually.

## Installing EDB Clone Schema

The following are the directions for installing EDB Clone Schema.

**These steps must be performed on any database to be used as the source or target database by an EDB Clone Schema function.**

**Step 1:** If you had previously installed an older version of the `edb_cloneschema` extension, then you must run the following command:

> `DROP EXTENSION parallel_clone CASCADE;`

This command also drops the `edb_cloneschema` extension.

**Step 2:** Install the extensions using the following commands:

> `CREATE EXTENSION parallel_clone SCHEMA public;`
>
> `CREATE EXTENSION edb_cloneschema;`

Make sure you create the parallel_clone extension before creating the `edb_cloneschema` extension.

## Creating the Foreign Servers and User Mappings

When using one of the local cloning functions, `localcopyschema` or `localcopyschema_nb`, one of the required parameters includes a single, foreign server for identifying the database server along with its database that is the source and the receiver of the cloned schema.

When using one of the remote cloning functions, `remotecopyschema` or `remotecopyschema_nb`, two of the required parameters include two foreign servers. The foreign server specified as the first parameter identifies the source database server along with its database that is the provider of the cloned schema. The foreign server specified as the second parameter identifies the target database server along with its database that is the receiver of the cloned schema.

For each foreign server, a user mapping must be created. When a selected database superuser invokes a cloning function, that database superuser who invokes the function must have been mapped to a database user name and password that has access to the foreign server that is specified as a parameter in the cloning function.

For general information about foreign data, foreign servers, and user mappings, see the PostgreSQL core documentation at:

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/ddl-foreign-data.html

The following two sections describe how these foreign servers and user mappings are defined.

### Foreign Server and User Mapping for Local Cloning Functions

For the `localcopyschema` and `localcopyschema_nb` functions, the source and target schemas are both within the same database of the same database server. Thus, only one foreign server must be defined and specified for these functions. This foreign server is also referred to as the *local server*.

This server is referred to as the local server because this server is the one to which you must be connected when invoking the `localcopyschema` or `localcopyschema_nb` function.

The user mapping defines the connection and authentication information for the foreign server.

**This foreign server and user mapping must be created within the database of the local server in which the cloning is to occur.**

**The database user for whom the user mapping is defined must be a superuser and the user connected to the local server when invoking an EDB Clone Schema function.**

The following example creates the foreign server for the database containing the schema to be cloned, and to receive the cloned schema as well.

> `CREATE SERVER local_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw`
>   `OPTIONS(`
>     `host 'localhost',`
>     `port '5444',`
>     `dbname 'edb'`
> `);`

For more information about using the `CREATE SERVER` command, see the PostgreSQL core documentation at:

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/sql-createserver.html

The user mapping for this server is the following:

> `CREATE USER MAPPING FOR enterprisedb SERVER local_server`
>   `OPTIONS (`
>     `user 'enterprisedb',`
>     `password 'password'`
> `);`

For more information about using the `CREATE USER MAPPING` command, see the PostgreSQL core documentation at:

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/sql-createusermapping.html

The following `psql` commands show the foreign server and user mapping:

```
edb=# \des+
List of foreign servers
-[ RECORD 1 ]--------+----------------------------------------------
Name                 | local_server
Owner                | enterprisedb
Foreign-data wrapper | postgres_fdw
Access privileges    |
Type                 |
Version              |
FDW options          | (host 'localhost', port '5444', dbname 'edb')
Description          |

edb=# \deu+
                           List of user mappings
    Server    |  User name   |                 FDW options
--------------+--------------+----------------------------------------------
 local_server | enterprisedb | ("user" 'enterprisedb', password 'password')
(1 row)
```

When database superuser `enterprisedb` invokes a cloning function, the database user `enterprisedb` with its password is used to connect to `local_server` on the `localhost` with port `5444` to database `edb`.

In this case, the mapped database user, `enterprisedb`, and the database user, `enterprisedb`, used to connect to the local `edb` database happen to be the same, identical database user, but that is not an absolute requirement.

For specific usage of these foreign server and user mapping examples, see the example given in Section [9.2.1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/user-guide/11/EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_Guide.1.080.html#pID0E0CW0HA).

### Foreign Server and User Mapping for Remote Cloning Functions

For the `remotecopyschema` and `remotecopyschema_nb` functions, the source and target schemas are in different databases of either the same or different database servers. Thus, two foreign servers must be defined and specified for these functions.

The foreign server defining the originating database server and its database containing the source schema to be cloned is referred to as the *source server* or the *remote server*.

The foreign server defining the database server and its database to receive the schema to be cloned is referred to as the *target server* or the *local server*.

The target server is also referred to as the local server because this server is the one to which you must be connected when invoking the `remotecopyschema` or `remotecopyschema_nb` function.

The user mappings define the connection and authentication information for the foreign servers.

**All of these foreign servers and user mappings must be created within the target database of the target/local server.**

**The database user for whom the user mappings are defined must be a superuser and the user connected to the local server when invoking an EDB Clone Schema function.**

The following example creates the foreign server for the local, target database that is to receive the cloned schema.

> `CREATE SERVER tgt_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw`
>   `OPTIONS(`
>     `host 'localhost',`
>     `port '5444',`
>     `dbname 'tgtdb'`
> `);`

The user mapping for this server is the following:

> `CREATE USER MAPPING FOR enterprisedb SERVER tgt_server`
>   `OPTIONS (`
>     `user 'tgtuser',`
>     `password 'tgtpassword'`
> `);`

The following example creates the foreign server for the remote, source database that is to be the source for the cloned schema.

> `CREATE SERVER src_server FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER postgres_fdw`
>   `OPTIONS(`
>     `host '192.168.2.28',`
>     `port '5444',`
>     `dbname 'srcdb'`
> `);`

The user mapping for this server is the following:

> `CREATE USER MAPPING FOR enterprisedb SERVER src_server`
>   `OPTIONS (`
>     `user 'srcuser',`
>     `password 'srcpassword'`
> `);`

The following `psql` commands show the foreign servers and user mappings:

```
tgtdb=# \des+
List of foreign servers
-[ RECORD 1 ]--------+---------------------------------------------------
Name                 | src_server
Owner                | tgtuser
Foreign-data wrapper | postgres_fdw
Access privileges    |
Type                 |
Version              |
FDW options          | (host '192.168.2.28', port '5444', dbname 'srcdb')
Description          |
-[ RECORD 2 ]--------+---------------------------------------------------
Name                 | tgt_server
Owner                | tgtuser
Foreign-data wrapper | postgres_fdw
Access privileges    |
Type                 |
Version              |
FDW options          | (host 'localhost', port '5444', dbname 'tgtdb')
Description          |

tgtdb=# \deu+
                         List of user mappings
   Server   |  User name   |                FDW options
------------+--------------+--------------------------------------------
 src_server | enterprisedb | ("user" 'srcuser', password 'srcpassword')
 tgt_server | enterprisedb | ("user" 'tgtuser', password 'tgtpassword')
(2 rows)
```

When database superuser `enterprisedb` invokes a cloning function, the database user `tgtuser` with password `tgtpassword` is used to connect to `tgt_server` on the `localhost` with port `5444` to database `tgtdb`.

In addition, database user `srcuser` with password `srcpassword` connects to `src_server` on host `192.168.2.28` with port `5444` to database `srcdb`.

**Note:** Be sure the `pg_hba.conf` file of the database server running the source database `srcdb` has an appropriate entry permitting connection from the target server location (address `192.168.2.27` in the following example) connecting with the database user `srcuser` that was included in the user mapping for the foreign server `src_server` defining the source server and database.

```
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     md5
# IPv4 local connections:
host    srcdb           srcuser         192.168.2.27/32         md5
```
