You can perform the following operations to debug a program:

- Step through the program one line at a time
- Execute the program until you reach a breakpoint
- View and change local variable values within the program

## Stepping Through the Code

Use the tool bar icons to step through a program with the Debugger:

![](images/the_tool_bar_icons.jpg)

<center><i>Figure 7.13 - The Tool bar icons</i></center>

The icons serve the following purposes:

- **Step into.** Click the `Step into` icon to execute the currently highlighted line of code.
- **Step over.** Click the `Step over` icon to execute a line of code, stepping over any sub-functions invoked by the code. The sub-function executes, but is not debugged unless it contains a breakpoint.
- **Continue/Start.** Click the `Continue/Start` icon to execute the highlighted code, and continue until the program encounters a breakpoint or completes.
- **Stop.** Click the `Stop` icon to halt the execution of a program.

## Using Breakpoints

As the Debugger executes a program, it pauses whenever it reaches a breakpoint. When the Debugger pauses, you can observe or change local variables, or navigate to an entry in the call stack to observe variables or set other breakpoints. The next step into, step over, or continue operation forces the debugger to resume execution with the next line of code following the breakpoint. There are two types of breakpoints:

***Local Breakpoint* -** A local breakpoint can be set at any executable line of code within a program. The Debugger pauses execution when it reaches a line where a local breakpoint has been set.

***Global Breakpoint* -** A global breakpoint will trigger when *any* session reaches that breakpoint. Set a global breakpoint if you want to perform in-context debugging of a program. When a global breakpoint is set on a program, the debugging session that set the global breakpoint waits until that program is invoked in another session. A global breakpoint can only be set by a superuser.

To create a local breakpoint, left-click within the grey shaded margin to the left of the line of code where you want the local breakpoint set. Where you click in the grey shaded margin should be close to the right side of the margin as in the spot where the breakpoint dot is shown on source code line 12 in Figure 7.14.

When created, the Debugger displays a dark dot in the margin, indicating a breakpoint has been set at the selected line of code.

You can set as many local breakpoints as desired. Local breakpoints remain in effect for the duration of a debugging session until they are removed.

**Removing a Local Breakpoint**

To remove a local breakpoint, left-click the mouse on the breakpoint dot in the grey shaded margin of the `Program Body` panel. The dot disappears, indicating that the breakpoint has been removed.

You can remove all of the breakpoints from the program that currently appears in the `Program Body` frame by clicking the `Clear all breakpoints` icon.

![](images/clear_all_breakpoints_icon.jpg)

<center><i>Figure 7.15 â€“ Clear all breakpoints icon</i></center>

**Note:** When you perform any of the preceding actions, only the breakpoints in the program that currently appears in the `Program Body` panel are removed. Breakpoints in called subprograms or breakpoints in programs that call the program currently appearing in the `Program Body` panel are not removed.

## Setting a Global Breakpoint for In-Context Debugging

To set a global breakpoint for in-context debugging, highlight the stored procedure, function, or trigger on which you wish to set the breakpoint in the `Browser` panel. Navigate through the `Object` menu to select `Debugging`, and then `Set Breakpoint`.

![](images/setting_a_global_breakpoint_from_the_object_menu.png)

<center><i>Figure 7.16 - Setting a global breakpoint from the Object menu</i></center>

Alternatively, you can right-click on the name of the stored procedure, function, or trigger on which you wish to set a global breakpoint and select `Debugging`, then `Set Breakpoint` from the context menu as shown by the following.

![](images/setting_a_global_breakpoint_from_the_objects_context_menu.png)

<center><i>Figure 7.17 - Setting a global breakpoint from the object's context menu</i></center>

To set a global breakpoint on a trigger, expand the table node that contains the trigger, highlight the specific trigger you wish to debug, and follow the same directions as for stored procedures and functions.

To set a global breakpoint in a package, highlight the specific procedure or function under the package node of the package you wish to debug and follow the same directions as for stored procedures and functions.

After you choose `Set Breakpoint`, the Debugger window opens and waits for an application to call the program to be debugged.

The PSQL client invokes the `select_emp` function (on which a global breakpoint has been set).

```
$ psql edb enterprisedb
psql.bin (11.0.2, server 11.0.2)
Type "help" for help.

edb=# SELECT select_emp(7900);
```

The `select_emp` function does not complete until you step through the program in the Debugger.

![](images/program_on_which_a_global_breakpoint_has_been_set.png)

<center><i>Figure 7.19 - Program on which a global breakpoint has been set</i></center>

You can now debug the program using any of the previously discussed operations such as step into, step over, and continue, or set local breakpoints. When you have stepped through execution of the program, the calling application (PSQL) regains control and the `select_emp` function completes execution and its output is displayed.

```
$ psql edb enterprisedb
psql.bin (11.0.2, server 11.0.2)
Type "help" for help.

edb=# SELECT select_emp(7900);

 select_emp
------------

(1 row)
```

At this point, you can end the Debugger session as shown in Section [7.5.4](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/user-guide/11/EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_Guide.1.074.html#pID0E0XHB0HA). If you do not end the Debugger session, the next application that invokes the program will encounter the global breakpoint and the debugging cycle will begin again.

## Exiting the Debugger

To end a Debugger session and exit the Debugger, click on the close icon (x) located in the upper-right corner to close the tab.
