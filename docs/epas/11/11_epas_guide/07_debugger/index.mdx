The Debugger gives developers and DBAs the ability to test and debug server-side programs using a graphical, dynamic environment. The types of programs that can be debugged are SPL stored procedures, functions, triggers, and packages as well as PL/pgSQL functions and triggers.

The Debugger is integrated with and invoked from *pgAdmin 4*. On Linux, the `edb-as`*`xx`*`-server-pldebugger` RPM package where *xx* is the Advanced Server version number, must be installed as well. Information about pgAdmin 4 is available at:

https://www.pgadmin.org/

There are two basic ways the Debugger can be used to test programs:

- **Standalone Debugging.** The Debugger is used to start the program to be tested. You supply any input parameter values required by the program and you can immediately observe and step through the code of the program. Standalone debugging is the typical method used for new programs and for initial problem investigation.
- **In-Context Debugging.** The program to be tested is initiated by an application other than the Debugger. You first set a *global breakpoint* on the program to be tested. The application that makes the first call to the program encounters the global breakpoint. The application suspends execution at which point the Debugger takes control of the called program. You can then observe and step through the code of the called program as it runs within the context of the calling application. After you have completely stepped through the code of the called program in the Debugger, the suspended application resumes execution. In-context debugging is useful if it is difficult to reproduce a problem using standalone debugging due to complex interaction with the calling application.

The debugging tools and operations are the same whether using standalone or in-context debugging. The difference is in how the program to be debugged is invoked.

The following sections discuss the features and functionality of the Debugger using the standalone debugging method. The directions for starting the Debugger for in-context debugging are discussed in Section [7.5.3](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/user-guide/11/EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_Guide.1.074.html#pID0E0DJB0HA).
