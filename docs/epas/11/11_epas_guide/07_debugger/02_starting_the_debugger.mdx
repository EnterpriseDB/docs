Note that triggers cannot be debugged using standalone debugging. Triggers must be debugged using in-context debugging. See Section [7.5.3](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/user-guide/11/EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_Guide.1.074.html#pID0E0DJB0HA) for information on setting a global breakpoint for in-context debugging.

To debug a package, highlight the specific procedure or function under the package node of the package you wish to debug and follow the same directions as for stored procedures and functions.
