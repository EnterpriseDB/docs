<div id="main_debugger_window" class="registered_link"></div>

The Main Debugger window contains two panels:

- The top Program Body panel displays the program source code.
- The bottom Tabs panel provides a set of tabs for different information.

Use the `Tool Bar` icons located at the top panel to access debugging functions.

The two panels are described in the following sections.

## The Program Body Panel

The `Program Body` panel displays the source code of the program that is being debugged.

Figure 7.5 shows that the Debugger is about to execute the `SELECT` statement. The blue indicator in the program body highlights the next statement to execute.

## The Tabs Panel

You can use the bottom `Tabs` panel to view or modify parameter values or local variables, or to view messages generated by `RAISE INFO` and function results.

The following is the information displayed by the tabs in the panel:

- The `Parameters` tab displays the current parameter values.
- The `Local variables` tab displays the value of any variables declared within the program.
- The `Messages` tab displays any results returned by the program as it executes.
-  The `Results` tab displays program results (if applicable) such as the value from the `RETURN` statement of a function.
-  The `Stack` tab has functionality described in Section [7.4.3](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/user-guide/11/EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_Guide.1.073.html#pID0E0QKB0HA).

The following figures show the results from the various tabs.

## The Stack Tab

The `Stack` tab displays a list of programs that are currently on the call stack (programs that have been invoked, but which have not yet completed). When a program is called, the name of the program is added to the top of the list displayed in the `Stack` tab. When the program ends, its name is removed from the list.

The `Stack` tab also displays information about program calls. The information includes:

- The location of the call within the program
- The call arguments
- The name of the program being called

Reviewing the call stack can help you trace the course of execution through a series of nested programs.

Figure 7.10 shows that `emp_query_caller` is about to call a subprogram named `emp_query`. `emp_query_caller` is currently at the top of the call stack.

After the call to `emp_query` executes, `emp_query` is displayed at the top of the `Stack` tab, and its code is displayed in the `Program Body` panel as shown in Figure 7.11.

Upon completion of execution of the subprogram, control returns to the calling program (`emp`_query_caller), now displayed at the top of the `Stack` tab as shown in Figure 7.12.
