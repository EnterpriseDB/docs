title: "Configuring SQL/Protect"
---

<div id="configuring_sql_protect" class="registered_link"></div>

The library file (`sqlprotect.so` on Linux, `sqlprotect.dll` on Windows) necessary to run SQL/Protect should be installed in the `lib` subdirectory of your Advanced Server home directory. For Windows, this should be done by the Advanced Server installer. For Linux, install the `edb-as`*`xx`*`-server-sqlprotect` RPM package where *`xx`* is the Advanced Server version number.

You will also need the SQL script file `sqlprotect.sql` located in the `share/contrib` subdirectory of your Advanced Server home directory.

You must configure the database server to use SQL/Protect, and you must configure each database that you want SQL/Protect to monitor:

- The database server configuration file, `postgresql.conf`, must be modified by adding and enabling configuration parameters used by SQL/Protect.
- Database objects used by SQL/Protect must be installed in each database that you want SQL/Protect to monitor.

**Step 1:** Edit the following configuration parameters in the `postgresql.conf` file located in the `data` subdirectory of your Advanced Server home directory.

- **shared_preload_libraries.** Add `$libdir/sqlprotect` to the list of libraries.

- **edb_sql_protect.enabled.** Controls whether or not SQL/Protect is actively monitoring protected roles by analyzing SQL statements issued by those roles and reacting according to the setting of `edb_sql_protect.level`. When you are ready to begin monitoring with SQL/Protect set this parameter to `on`. If this parameter is omitted, the default is `off`.

- **edb_sql_protect.level.** Sets the action taken by SQL/Protect when a SQL statement is issued by a protected role. If this parameter is omitted, the default behavior is `passive`. Initially, set this parameter to `learn`. See Section [4.1.2.1.2](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/user-guide/11/EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_Guide.1.050.html#pID0E0LCD0HA) for further explanation of this parameter.

- **edb_sql_protect.max_protected_roles.** Sets the maximum number of roles that can be protected. If this parameter is omitted, the default setting is `64`. See Section [3.1.3.12.8](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/user-guide/11/EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_Guide.1.033.html#pID0E0H5E0HA) for information on the maximum range of this parameter.

- **edb_sql_protect.max_protected_relations.** Sets the maximum number of relations that can be protected per role. If this parameter is omitted, the default setting is `1024`.

  Please note the total number of protected relations for the server will be the number of protected relations times the number of protected roles. Every protected relation consumes space in shared memory. The space for the maximum possible protected relations is reserved during database server startup.

  See Section [3.1.3.12.7](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/user-guide/11/EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_Guide.1.033.html#pID0E0Y5E0HA) for information about the maximum range of this parameter.

- **edb_sql_protect.max_queries_to_save.** Sets the maximum number of offending queries to save in the `edb_sql_protect_queries` view. If this parameter is omitted, the default setting is `5000`. If the number of offending queries reaches the limit, additional queries are not saved in the view, but are accessible in the database server log file. **Note:** The minimum valid value for this parameter is `100`. If a value less than `100` is specified, the database server starts using the default setting of `5000`. A warning message is recorded in the database server log file. See Section [3.1.3.12.9](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/user-guide/11/EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_Guide.1.033.html#pID0E0V4E0HA) for information on the maximum range of this parameter.

The following example shows the settings of these parameters in the `postgresql.conf` file:

```
shared_preload_libraries = '$libdir/dbms_pipe,$libdir/edb_gen,$libdir/sqlprotect'
                                        # (change requires restart)
 	.
 	.
 	.
edb_sql_protect.enabled = off
edb_sql_protect.level = learn
edb_sql_protect.max_protected_roles = 64
edb_sql_protect.max_protected_relations = 1024
edb_sql_protect.max_queries_to_save = 5000
```

**Step 2:** Restart the database server after you have modified the `postgresql.conf` file.

**On Linux:** Invoke the Advanced Server service script with the `restart` option:

On a Redhat or CentOS 6.x installation, use the command:

> `/etc/init.d/edb-as-11 restart`

On a Redhat or CentOS 7.x installation, use the command:

> `systemctl restart edb-as-11`

**On Windows:** Use the Windows Services applet to restart the service named `edb-as-11`.

**Step 3:** For each database that you want to protect from SQL injection attacks, connect to the database as a superuser (either `enterprisedb` or `postgres`, depending upon your installation options) and run the script `sqlprotect.sql` located in the `share/contrib` subdirectory of your Advanced Server home directory. The script creates the SQL/Protect database objects in a schema named `sqlprotect`.

The following example shows this process to set up protection for a database named `edb`:

```
$ /usr/edb/as11/bin/psql -d edb -U enterprisedb
Password for user enterprisedb:
psql.bin (11.0.2, server 11.0.2)
Type "help" for help.

## Selecting Roles to Protect

After the SQL/Protect database objects have been created in a database, you select the roles for which SQL queries are to be monitored for protection, and the level of protection.

### Setting the Protected Roles List

For each database that you want to protect, you must determine the roles you want to monitor and then add those roles to the *protected roles list* of that database.

**Step 1:** Connect as a superuser to a database that you wish to protect using either `psql` or Postgres Enterprise Manager Client.

```
$ /usr/edb/as11/bin/psql -d edb -U enterprisedb
Password for user enterprisedb:
psql.bin (11.0.2, server 11.0.2)
Type "help" for help.

edb=#
```

**Step 2:** Since the SQL/Protect tables, functions, and views are built under the `sqlprotect` schema, use the `SET search_path` command to include the `sqlprotect` schema in your search path. This eliminates the need to schema-qualify any operation or query involving SQL/Protect database objects.

```
edb=# SET search_path TO sqlprotect;
SET
```

**Step 3:** Each role that you wish to protect must be added to the protected roles list. This list is maintained in the table `edb_sql_protect`.

To add a role, use the function `protect_role('`*`rolename`*`')`.

The following example protects a role named `appuser`.

```
edb=# SELECT protect_role('appuser');
 protect_role
--------------

(1 row)
```

You can list the roles that have been added to the protected roles list by issuing the following query:

```
edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_sql_protect;
 dbid  | roleid | protect_relations | allow_utility_cmds | allow_tautology | allow_empty_dml
-------+--------+-------------------+--------------------+-----------------+-----------------
 13917 |  16671 | t                 | f                  | f               | f
(1 row)
```

A view is also provided that gives the same information using the object names instead of the Object Identification numbers (OIDs).

```
edb=# \x
Expanded display is on.
edb=# SELECT * FROM list_protected_users;
-[ RECORD 1 ]------+--------
dbname             | edb
username           | appuser
protect_relations  | t
allow_utility_cmds | f
allow_tautology    | f
allow_empty_dml    | f
```

### Setting the Protection Level

Configuration parameter `edb_sql_protect.level` sets the protection level, which defines the behavior of SQL/Protect when a protected role issues a SQL statement. **The defined behavior applies to all roles in the protected roles lists of all databases configured with SQL/Protect in the database server.**

In the `postgresql.conf` file the `edb_sql_protect.level` configuration parameter can be set to one of the following values to use either learn mode, passive mode, or active mode:

- **learn.** Tracks the activities of protected roles and records the relations used by the roles. This is used when initially configuring SQL/Protect so the expected behaviors of the protected applications are learned.
- **passive.** Issues warnings if protected roles are breaking the defined rules, but does not stop any SQL statements from executing. This is the next step after SQL/Protect has learned the expected behavior of the protected roles. This essentially behaves in intrusion detection mode and can be run in production when properly monitored.
- **active.** Stops all invalid statements for a protected role. This behaves as a SQL firewall preventing dangerous queries from running. This is particularly effective against early penetration testing when the attacker is trying to determine the vulnerability point and the type of database behind the application. Not only does SQL/Protect close those vulnerability points, but it tracks the blocked queries allowing administrators to be alerted before the attacker finds an alternate method of penetrating the system.

If the `edb_sql_protect.level` parameter is not set or is omitted from the configuration file, the default behavior of SQL/Protect is passive.

If you are using SQL/Protect for the first time, set `edb_sql_protect.level` to learn.

## Monitoring Protected Roles

Once you have configured SQL/Protect in a database, added roles to the protected roles list, and set the desired protection level, you can then activate SQL/Protect in one of learn mode, passive mode, or active mode. You can then start running your applications.

With a new SQL/Protect installation, the first step is to determine the relations that protected roles should be permitted to access during normal operation. Learn mode allows a role to run applications during which time SQL/Protect is recording the relations that are accessed. These are added to the role’s *protected relations list* stored in table `edb_sql_protect_rel`.

Monitoring for protection against attack begins when SQL/Protect is run in passive or active mode. In passive and active modes, the role is permitted to access the relations in its protected relations list as these were determined to be the relations the role should be able to access during typical usage.

However, if a role attempts to access a relation that is not in its protected relations list, a `WARNING` or `ERROR` severity level message is returned by SQL/Protect. The role’s attempted action on the relation may or may not be carried out depending upon whether the mode is passive or active.

### Learn Mode

**Step 1:** To activate SQL/Protect in learn mode, set the following parameters in the `postgresql.conf` file as shown below:

```
edb_sql_protect.enabled = on
edb_sql_protect.level = learn
```

**Step 2:** Reload the `postgresql.conf` file.

Choose Expert Configuration, then Reload Configuration from the Advanced Server application menu.

**Note:** For an alternative method of reloading the configuration file, use the `pg_reload_conf` function. Be sure you are connected to a database as a superuser and execute function `pg_reload_conf` as shown by the following example:

```
edb=# SELECT pg_reload_conf();
 pg_reload_conf
----------------
 t
(1 row)
```

**Step 3:** Allow the protected roles to run their applications.

As an example the following queries are issued in the `psql` application by protected role `appuser`:

```
edb=> SELECT * FROM dept;
NOTICE:  SQLPROTECT: Learned relation: 16384
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
(4 rows)

edb=> SELECT empno, ename, job FROM emp WHERE deptno = 10;
NOTICE:  SQLPROTECT: Learned relation: 16391
 empno | ename  |    job
-------+--------+-----------
  7782 | CLARK  | MANAGER
  7839 | KING   | PRESIDENT
  7934 | MILLER | CLERK
(3 rows)
```

SQL/Protect generates a `NOTICE` severity level message indicating the relation has been added to the role’s protected relations list.

In SQL/Protect learn mode, SQL statements that are cause for suspicion are not prevented from executing, but a message is issued to alert the user to potentially dangerous statements as shown by the following example:

```
edb=> CREATE TABLE appuser_tab (f1 INTEGER);
NOTICE:  SQLPROTECT: This command type is illegal for this user
CREATE TABLE
edb=> DELETE FROM appuser_tab;
NOTICE:  SQLPROTECT: Learned relation: 16672
NOTICE:  SQLPROTECT: Illegal Query: empty DML
DELETE 0
```

**Step 4:** As a protected role runs applications, the SQL/Protect tables can be queried to observe the addition of relations to the role’s protected relations list.

Connect as a superuser to the database you are monitoring and set the search path to include the `sqlprotect` schema.

```
edb=# SET search_path TO sqlprotect;
SET
```

Query the `edb_sql_protect_rel` table to see the relations added to the protected relations list:

```
edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_sql_protect_rel;
 dbid  | roleid | relid
-------+--------+-------
 13917 |  16671 | 16384
 13917 |  16671 | 16391
 13917 |  16671 | 16672
(3 rows)
```

The view `list_protected_rels` is provided that gives more comprehensive information along with the object names instead of the OIDs.

```
edb=# SELECT * FROM list_protected_rels;
 Database | Protected User | Schema |    Name     | Type  |    Owner
----------+----------------+--------+-------------+-------+--------------
 edb      | appuser        | public | dept        | Table | enterprisedb
 edb      | appuser        | public | emp         | Table | enterprisedb
 edb      | appuser        | public | appuser_tab | Table | appuser
(3 rows)
```

### Passive Mode

Once you have determined that a role’s applications have accessed all relations they will need, you can now change the protection level so that SQL/Protect can actively monitor the incoming SQL queries and protect against SQL injection attacks.

Passive mode is the less restrictive of the two protection modes, passive and active.

**Step 1:** To activate SQL/Protect in passive mode, set the following parameters in the `postgresql.conf` file as shown below:

```
edb_sql_protect.enabled = on
edb_sql_protect.level = passive
```

**Step 2:** Reload the configuration file as shown in Step 2 of Section [4.1.2.2.1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/user-guide/11/EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_Guide.1.050.html#pID0E05BD0HA).

Now SQL/Protect is in passive mode. For relations that have been learned such as the `dept` and `emp` tables of the prior examples, SQL statements are permitted with no special notification to the client by SQL/Protect as shown by the following queries run by user `appuser`:

```
edb=> SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
(4 rows)

edb=> SELECT empno, ename, job FROM emp WHERE deptno = 10;
 empno | ename  |    job
-------+--------+-----------
  7782 | CLARK  | MANAGER
  7839 | KING   | PRESIDENT
  7934 | MILLER | CLERK
(3 rows)
```

SQL/Protect does not prevent any SQL statement from executing, but issues a message of `WARNING` severity level for SQL statements executed against relations that were not learned, or for SQL statements that contain a prohibited signature as shown in the following example:

```
edb=> CREATE TABLE appuser_tab_2 (f1 INTEGER);
WARNING:  SQLPROTECT: This command type is illegal for this user
CREATE TABLE
edb=> INSERT INTO appuser_tab_2 VALUES (1);
WARNING:  SQLPROTECT: Illegal Query: relations
INSERT 0 1
edb=> INSERT INTO appuser_tab_2 VALUES (2);
WARNING:  SQLPROTECT: Illegal Query: relations
INSERT 0 1
edb=> SELECT * FROM appuser_tab_2 WHERE 'x' = 'x';
WARNING:  SQLPROTECT: Illegal Query: relations
WARNING:  SQLPROTECT: Illegal Query: tautology
 f1
----
  1
  2
(2 rows)
```

**Step 3:** Monitor the statistics for suspicious activity.

By querying the view `edb_sql_protect_stats`, you can see the number of times SQL statements were executed that referenced relations that were not in a role’s protected relations list, or contained SQL injection attack signatures. See Section [4.1.1.2.2](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/user-guide/11/EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_Guide.1.049.html#pID0E0QGD0HA) for more information on view `edb_sql_protect_stats`.

The following is a query on `edb_sql_protect_stats`:

```
edb=# SET search_path TO sqlprotect;
SET
edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_sql_protect_stats;
 username | superusers | relations | commands | tautology | dml
----------+------------+-----------+----------+-----------+-----
 appuser  |          0 |         3 |        1 |         1 |   0
(1 row)
```

**Step 4:** View information on specific attacks.

By querying the view `edb_sql_protect_queries`, you can see the SQL statements that were executed that referenced relations that were not in a role’s protected relations list, or contained SQL injection attack signatures. See Section [4.1.1.2.3](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/user-guide/11/EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_Guide.1.049.html#pID0E0DGD0HA) for more information on view `edb_sql_protect_queries`.

The following is a query on `edb_sql_protect_queries`:

```
edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_sql_protect_queries;
-[ RECORD 1 ]+---------------------------------------------
 username     | appuser
 ip_address   |
 port         |
 machine_name |
 date_time    | 20-JUN-14 13:21:00 -04:00
 query        | INSERT INTO appuser_tab_2 VALUES (1);
-[ RECORD 2 ]+---------------------------------------------
 username     | appuser
 ip_address   |
 port         |
 machine_name |
 date_time    | 20-JUN-14 13:21:00 -04:00
 query        | CREATE TABLE appuser_tab_2 (f1 INTEGER);
-[ RECORD 3 ]+---------------------------------------------
 username     | appuser
 ip_address   |
 port         |
 machine_name |
 date_time    | 20-JUN-14 13:22:00 -04:00
 query        | INSERT INTO appuser_tab_2 VALUES (2);
-[ RECORD 4 ]+---------------------------------------------
 username     | appuser
 ip_address   |
 port         |
 machine_name |
 date_time    | 20-JUN-14 13:22:00 -04:00
 query        | SELECT * FROM appuser_tab_2 WHERE 'x' = 'x';
```

**Note:** The `ip_address` and `port` columns do not return any information if the attack originated on the same host as the database server using the Unix-domain socket (that is, `pg_hba.conf` connection type `local`).

### Active Mode

In active mode, disallowed SQL statements are prevented from executing. Also, the message issued by SQL/Protect has a higher severity level of `ERROR` instead of `WARNING`.

**Step 1:** To activate SQL/Protect in active mode, set the following parameters in the `postgresql.conf` file as shown below:

```
edb_sql_protect.enabled = on
edb_sql_protect.level = active
```

**Step 2:** Reload the configuration file as shown in Step 2 of Section [4.1.2.2.1](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/user-guide/11/EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_Guide.1.050.html#pID0E05BD0HA).

The following example illustrates SQL statements similar to those given in the examples of Step 2 in Section [4.1.2.2.2](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/user-guide/11/EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_Guide.1.050.html#pID0E0BAD0HA), but executed by user `appuser` when `edb_sql_protect.level` is set to active:

```
edb=> CREATE TABLE appuser_tab_3 (f1 INTEGER);
ERROR:  SQLPROTECT: This command type is illegal for this user
edb=> INSERT INTO appuser_tab_2 VALUES (1);
ERROR:  SQLPROTECT: Illegal Query: relations
edb=> SELECT * FROM appuser_tab_2 WHERE 'x' = 'x';
ERROR:  SQLPROTECT: Illegal Query: relations
```

The following shows the resulting statistics:

```
edb=# SELECT * FROM sqlprotect.edb_sql_protect_stats;
 username | superusers | relations | commands | tautology | dml
----------+------------+-----------+----------+-----------+-----
 appuser  |          0 |         5 |        2 |         1 |   0
(1 row)
```

The following is a query on `edb_sql_protect_queries`:

```
edb=# SELECT * FROM sqlprotect.edb_sql_protect_queries;
-[ RECORD 1 ]+---------------------------------------------
 username     | appuser
