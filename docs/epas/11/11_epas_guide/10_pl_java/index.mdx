The PL/Java package provides access to Java stored procedures, triggers, and functions via the JDBC interface. Unless otherwise noted, the commands and paths noted in the following section assume that you have performed an installation with the `edb-as`*`xx`*`-pljava` RPM package where *`xx`* is the Advanced Server version number.

Before installing PL/Java for use with a standard Java virtual machine (JVM) on a Linux system, you must first confirm that a Java runtime environment (version 1.8) is installed on your system. Installation of a Java development kit also provides a Java runtime environment.

Please Note: The PL/Java package is deprecated in Advanced Server 11 and will be unavailable in server versions 12 or later.
