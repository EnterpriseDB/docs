There are several ways to install Advanced Server that will allow you to take advantage of compatibility features:

-  Use the `INITDBOPTS` variable (in the Advanced Server service configuration file) to specify --`redwood-like` before initializing your cluster.
- When invoking `initdb` to initialize your cluster, include the --`redwood-like` option.

For more information about the installation options supported by the Advanced Server installers, please see the EDB Postgres Advanced Server Installation Guide, available from the EDB website at:
