EnterpriseDB has enhanced ECPG (the PostgreSQL pre-compiler) to create ECPGPlus. ECPGPlus allows you to include embedded SQL commands in C applications; when you use ECPGPlus to compile an application that contains embedded SQL commands, the SQL code is syntax-checked and translated into C.

ECPGPlus supports Pro\*C syntax in C programs when connected to an Advanced Server database. ECPGPlus supports:

- Oracle Dynamic SQL â€“ Method 4 (ODS-M4)
- Pro\*C compatible anonymous blocks
- A CALL statement compatible with Oracle databases

For information about using ECPGPlus, please see the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server ECPG Connector Guide*, available from the EnterpriseDB website at:
