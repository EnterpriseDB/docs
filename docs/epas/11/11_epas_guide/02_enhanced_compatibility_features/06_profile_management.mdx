Advanced Server supports compatible SQL syntax for profile management. Profile management commands allow a database superuser to create and manage named *profiles*. Each profile defines rules for password management that augment `password` and `md5` authentication. The rules in a profile can:

- count failed login attempts
- lock an account due to excessive failed login attempts
- mark a password for expiration
- define a grace period after a password expiration
- define rules for password complexity
- define rules that limit password re-use

A profile is a named set of attributes that allow you to easily manage a group of roles that share comparable authentication requirements. If password requirements change, you can modify the profile to have the new requirements applied to each user that is associated with that profile.

After creating the profile, you can associate the profile with one or more users. When a user connects to the server, the server enforces the profile that is associated with their login role. Profiles are shared by all databases within a cluster, but each cluster may have multiple profiles. A single user with access to multiple databases will use the same profile when connecting to each database within the cluster.
