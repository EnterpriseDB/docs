When you invoke a `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, or `UPDATE` command, the server generates a set of execution plans; after analyzing those execution plans, the server selects a plan that will (generally) return the result set in the least amount of time. The server's choice of plan is dependent upon several factors:

- The estimated execution cost of data handling operations.
- Parameter values assigned to parameters in the Query Tuning section of the `postgresql.conf` file.
- Column statistics that have been gathered by the `ANALYZE` command

As a rule, the query planner will select the least expensive plan. You can use an optimizer hint to influence the server as it selects a query plan.

An optimizer hint is a directive (or multiple directives) embedded in a comment-like syntax that immediately follows a `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT` or `UPDATE` command. Keywords in the comment instruct the server to employ or avoid a specific plan when producing the result set.
