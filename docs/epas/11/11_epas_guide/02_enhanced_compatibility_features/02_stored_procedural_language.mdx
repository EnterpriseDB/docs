Advanced Server supports a highly productive procedural language that allows you to write custom procedures, functions, triggers and packages. The procedural language:

- complements the SQL language and built-in packages.
- provides a seamless development and testing environment.
- allows you to create reusable code.

For information about using the Stored Procedural Language, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Guide*, available at:
