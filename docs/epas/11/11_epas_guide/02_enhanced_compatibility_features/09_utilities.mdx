For detailed information about the compatible syntax supported by the utilities listed below, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Tools and Utilities Guide*, available at:

<i>**EDB\*Plus**</i>

EDB\*Plus is a utility program that provides a command line user interface to the Advanced Server that will be familiar to Oracle developers and users. EDB\*Plus accepts SQL commands, SPL anonymous blocks, and EDB\*Plus commands.

EDB\*Plus allows you to:

- Query certain database objects
- Execute stored procedures
- Format output from SQL commands
- Execute batch scripts
- Execute OS commands
- Record output

For detailed information about EDB\*Plus, please see the *EDB\*Plus User's Guide* available at:

<i>**EDB\*Loader**</i>

EDB\*Loader is a high-performance bulk data loader that provides an interface compatible with Oracle databases for Advanced Server. The EDB\*Loader command line utility loads data from an input source, typically a file, into one or more tables using a subset of the parameters offered by Oracle SQL\*Loader.

EDB\*Loader features include:

- Support for the Oracle SQL\*Loader data loading methods - conventional path load, direct path load, and parallel direct path load
- Oracle SQL\*Loader compatible syntax for control file directives
- Input data with delimiter-separated or fixed-width fields
- Bad file for collecting rejected records
- Loading of multiple target tables
- Discard file for collecting records that do not meet the selection criteria of any target table
- Log file for recording the EDB\*Loader session and any error messages
- Data loading from standard input and remote loading

<i>**EDB\*Wrap**</i>

The EDB\*Wrap utility protects proprietary source code and programs (functions, stored procedures, triggers, and packages) from unauthorized scrutiny. The EDB\*Wrap program translates a file that contains SPL or PL/pgSQL source code (the plaintext) into a file that contains the same code in a form that is nearly impossible to read. Once you have the obfuscated form of the code, you can send that code to Advanced Server and it will store those programs in obfuscated form. While EDB\*Wrap does obscure code, table definitions are still exposed.

Everything you wrap is stored in obfuscated form.  If you wrap an entire package, the package body source, as well as the prototypes contained in the package header and the functions and procedures contained in the package body are stored in obfuscated form.

<i>**Dynamic Runtime Instrumentation Tools Architecture (DRITA)**</i>

The Dynamic Runtime Instrumentation Tools Architecture (DRITA) allows a DBA to query catalog views to determine the *wait events* that affect the performance of individual sessions or the system as a whole. DRITA records the number of times each event occurs as well as the time spent waiting; you can use this information to diagnose performance problems. DRITA offers this functionality, while consuming minimal system resources.

DRITA compares *snapshots* to evaluate the performance of a system. A snapshot is a saved set of system performance data at a given point in time. Each snapshot is identified by a unique ID number; you can use snapshot ID numbers with DRITA reporting functions to return system performance statistics.
