Prior to Advanced Server 11, a system catalog named `dbo` was available. The dbo system catalog contained views of database objects for similarity with Microsoft SQL Server.

Now, for Advanced Server neither the `dbo` system catalog nor a schema named `dbo` exist in any database.

If it is desired to have such a schema with its SQL Server compatible views, use the `CREATE EXTENSION edb_dbo` command to create the `dbo` schema and its content.

The following example shows the creation of the `dbo` schema and its views:

```
edb=# CREATE EXTENSION edb_dbo;
CREATE EXTENSION
edb=# \dn
    List of schemas
  Name  |    Owner
--------+--------------
 dbo    | enterprisedb
 public | enterprisedb
(2 rows)

edb=# SET search_path TO dbo;
SET
edb=# \dv
             List of relations
 Schema |    Name    | Type |    Owner
--------+------------+------+--------------
 dbo    | sysindexes | view | enterprisedb
 dbo    | sysobjects | view | enterprisedb
 dbo    | systables  | view | enterprisedb
 dbo    | systypes   | view | enterprisedb
 dbo    | sysusers   | view | enterprisedb
(5 rows)
```
