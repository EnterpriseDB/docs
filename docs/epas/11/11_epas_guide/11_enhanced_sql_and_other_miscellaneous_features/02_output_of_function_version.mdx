The text string output of the `version()` function displays the name of the product, its version, and the host system on which it has been installed.

For Advanced Server, the `version()` output is in a format similar to the PostgreSQL community version in that the first text word is *PostgreSQL* instead of *EnterpriseDB* as in Advanced Server version 10 and earlier.

The general format of the version() output is the following:

```
PostgreSQL $PG_VERSION_EXT (EnterpriseDB Advanced Server $PG_VERSION) on $host
```

So for the current Advanced Server the version string appears as follows:

```
edb@45032=#select version();
version
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
PostgreSQL 11.0 (EnterpriseDB Advanced Server 11.0.0) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-11), 64-bit
(1 row)
```

In contrast, for Advanced Server 10, the version string was the following:

```
edb=# select version();
                                                   version
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 EnterpriseDB 10.4.9 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (GCC) 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 4.4.7-18), 64-bit
(1 row)

```
