*EDB Resource Manager* is an Advanced Server feature that provides the capability to control the usage of operating system resources used by Advanced Server processes.

This capability allows you to protect the system from processes that may uncontrollably overuse and monopolize certain system resources.

The following are some key points about using EDB Resource Manager.

-  The basic component of EDB Resource Manager is a resource group. A *resource group* is a named, global group, available to all databases in an Advanced Server instance, on which various resource usage limits can be defined. Advanced Server processes that are assigned as members of a given resource group are then controlled by EDB Resource Manager so that the aggregate resource usage of all processes in the group is kept near the limits defined on the group.
-  Data definition language commands are used to create, alter, and drop resource groups. These commands can only be used by a database user with superuser privileges.
- The desired, aggregate consumption level of all processes belonging to a resource group is defined by *resource type parameters*. There are different resource type parameters for the different types of system resources currently supported by EDB Resource Manager.
- Multiple resource groups can be created, each with different settings for its resource type parameters, thus defining different consumption levels for each resource group.
- EDB Resource Manager throttles processes in a resource group to keep resource consumption near the limits defined by the resource type parameters. If there are multiple resource type parameters with defined settings in a resource group, the actual resource consumption may be significantly lower for certain resource types than their defined resource type parameter settings. This is because EDB Resource Manager throttles processes attempting to keep *all resources with defined resource type settings within their defined limits*.
- The definition of available resource groups and their resource type settings are stored in a shared global system catalog. Thus, resource groups can be utilized by all databases in a given Advanced Server instance.
- The `edb_max_resource_groups` configuration parameter sets the maximum number of resource groups that can be active simultaneously with running processes. The default setting is 16 resource groups. Changes to this parameter take effect on database server restart.
- Use the `SET` `edb_resource_group` `TO` *`group_name`* command to assign the current process to a specified resource group. Use the `RESET` `edb_resource_group` command or `SET` `edb_resource_group` `TO` `DEFAULT` to remove the current process from a resource group.
- A default resource group can be assigned to a role using the `ALTER ROLE ... SET` command, or to a database by the `ALTER DATABASE ... SET` command. The entire database server instance can be assigned a default resource group by setting the parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file.
-  In order to include resource groups in a backup file of the database server instance, use the `pg_dumpall` backup utility with default settings (That is, do not specify any of the `--globals-only`, `--roles-only`, or `--tablespaces-only` options.)
