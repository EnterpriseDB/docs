libpq is the C application programmer’s interface to Advanced Server. libpq is a set of library functions that allow client programs to pass queries to the Advanced Server and to receive the results of these queries.

libpq is also the underlying engine for several other EnterpriseDB application interfaces including those written for C++, Perl, Python, Tcl and ECPG. So some aspects of libpq’s behavior will be important to the user if one of those packages is used.

Client programs that use libpq must include the header file `libpq-fe.h` and must link with the `libpq` library.
