The `edb_dir` table contains one row for each alias that points to a directory created with the `CREATE DIRECTORY` command. A directory is an alias for a pathname that allows a user limited access to the host file system.

You can use a directory to fence a user into a specific directory tree within the file system. For example, the `UTL_FILE` package offers functions that permit a user to read and write files and directories in the host file system, but only allows access to paths that the database administrator has granted access to via a `CREATE DIRECTORY` command.
