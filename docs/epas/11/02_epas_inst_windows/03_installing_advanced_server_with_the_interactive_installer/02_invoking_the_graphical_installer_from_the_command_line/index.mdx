The command line options of the Advanced Server installer offer functionality for Windows systems that reside in situations where a graphical installation may not work because of limited resources or privileges. You can:

- Include the `--mode unattended` option when invoking the installer to perform an installation without user input.
- Invoke the installer with the `--extract-only` option to perform a minimal installation when you donâ€™t hold the privileges required to perform a complete installation.

Not all command line options are suitable for all situations. For a complete reference guide to the command line options, see Section [3.2.3](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/installation-getting-started/installation-guide-for-windows/11/EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_Installation_Guide_Windows.1.12.html#pID0E0SK0HA), *Reference - Command Line Options*.

Please note: If you are invoking the installer from the command line to perform a system upgrade, the installer will ignore command line options, and preserve the configuration of the previous installation.
