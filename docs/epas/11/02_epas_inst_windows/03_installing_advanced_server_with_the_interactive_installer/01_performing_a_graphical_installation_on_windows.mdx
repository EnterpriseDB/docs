<center><i>Figure 3.5 -The Additional Directories window.</i></center>

By default, the Advanced Server `data` files are saved to:

> `C:\Program Files\edb\as11\data`

The default location of the Advanced Server Write-Ahead Log (WAL) Directory is:

> `C:\Program Files\edb\as11\data\pg_wal`

Advanced Server uses write-ahead logs to promote transaction safety and speed transaction processing; when you make a change to a table, the change is stored in shared memory and a record of the change is written to the write-ahead log. When you perform a `COMMIT`, Advance Server writes contents of the write-ahead log to disk.

Accept the default file locations, or use the `File Browser` icon to select an alternate location; click Next to continue to the `Advanced Server Dialect` window.

![](images/the_advanced_server_dialect_window.png)

<center><i>Figure 3.6 -The Advanced Server Dialect window.</i></center>

Use the drop-down listbox on the `Advanced Server Dialect` window (see Figure 3.6) to choose a server dialect. The server dialect specifies the compatibility features supported by Advanced Server.

By default, Advance Server installs in `Compatible with Oracle` mode; you can choose between `Compatible with Oracle` and `Compatible with PostgreSQL` installation modes.

**Compatible with Oracle**

If you select `Compatible with Oracle`, the installation will include the following features:

- Data dictionary views that is compatible with Oracle databases.

This is not a comprehensive list of the compatibility features for Oracle included when Advanced Server is installed in `Compatible with Oracle` mode; for more information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer’s Guide* available from the EnterpriseDB website at:

http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/products/documentation

If you choose to install in `Compatible with Oracle` mode, the Advanced Server superuser name is `enterprisedb`.

**Compatible with PostgreSQL**

If you select `Compatible with PostgreSQL`, Advanced Server will exhibit compatibility with PostgreSQL version 11. If you choose to install in `Compatible with PostgreSQL` mode, the default Advanced Server superuser name is `postgres`.

For detailed information about PostgreSQL functionality, visit the official PostgreSQL website at:

[http://www.postgresql.org](http://www.postgresql.org/)

After specifying a configuration mode, click Next to continue to the `Password` window (shown in Figure 3.7).

![](images/the_password_window.png)

<center><i>Figure 3.7 -The Password window.</i></center>

Advanced Server uses the password specified on the `Password` window for the database superuser. The specified password must conform to any security policies existing on the Advanced Server host.

After you enter a password in the `Password` field, confirm the password in the `Retype Password` field, and click `Next` to continue.

The `Additional Configuration` window opens (shown in Figure 3.8).

![](images/the_additional_configuration_window.png)

<center><i>Figure 3.8 -The Additional Configuration window.</i></center>

Use the fields on the `Additional Configuration` window to specify installation details:

- Use the `Port` field to specify the port number that Advanced Server should listen to for connection requests from client applications. The default is `5444`.
- If the `Locale` field is set to `[Default locale]`, Advanced Server uses the system locale as the working locale. Use the drop-down listbox next to `Locale` to specify an alternate locale for Advanced Server.
- By default, the `Setup` wizard installs corresponding sample data for the server dialect specified by the compatibility mode (`Oracle` or `PostgreSQL`). Clear the check box next to `Install sample tables and procedures` if you do not wish to have sample data installed.

After verifying the information on the `Additional Configuration` window, click `Next` to open the `Dynatune Dynamic Tuning: Server Utilization` window (shown in Figure 3.9).

The graphical `Setup` wizard facilitates performance tuning via the Dynatune Dynamic Tuning feature. Dynatune functionality allows Advanced Server to make optimal usage of the system resources available on the host machine on which it is installed.

![](images/the_dynatune_dynamic_tuning_server_utilization_window.png)

<center><i>Figure 3.9 -The Dynatune Dynamic Tuning: Server Utilization window.</i></center>

The `edb_dynatune` configuration parameter determines how Advanced Server allocates system resources. Use the radio buttons on the `Server Utilization` window to set the initial value of the `edb_dynatune` configuration parameter:

- Select `Development` to set the value of `edb_dynatune` to `33`. A low value dedicates the least amount of the host machine’s resources to the database server. This is a good choice for a development machine.
- Select `General Purpose` to set the value of `edb_dynatune` to `66`. A mid-range value dedicates a moderate amount of system resources to the database server. This would be a good setting for an application server with a fixed number of applications running on the same host as Advanced Server.
- Select `Dedicated` to set the value of `edb_dynatune` to `100`. A high value dedicates most of the system resources to the database server. This is a good choice for a dedicated server host.

After the installation is complete, you can adjust the value of `edb_dynatune` by editing the `postgresql.conf` file, located in the data directory of your Advanced Server installation. After editing the `postgresql.conf` file, you must restart the server for your changes to take effect.

Select the appropriate setting for your system, and click `Next` to continue to the `Dynatune Dynamic Tuning: Workload Profile` window (shown in Figure 3.10).

![](images/the_dynatune_dynamic_tuning_workload_profile_window.png)

<center><i>Figure 3.10 -The Dynatune Dynamic Tuning: Workload Profile window.</i></center>

Use the radio buttons on the `Workload Profile` window to specify the initial value of the `edb_dynatune_profile` configuration parameter. The `edb_dynatune_profile` parameter controls performance-tuning aspects based on the type of work that the server performs.

- Select `Transaction Processing (OLTP systems)` to specify an `edb_dynatune_profile` value of `oltp`. Recommended when Advanced Server is supporting heavy online transaction processing.
- Select `General Purpose (OLTP and reporting workloads)` to specify an `edb_dynatune_profile` value of mixed. Recommended for servers that provide a mix of transaction processing and data reporting.
- Select `Reporting (Complex queries or OLAP workloads)` to specify an `edb_dynatune_profile` value of `reporting`. Recommended for database servers used for heavy data reporting.

After the installation is complete, you can adjust the value of `edb_dynatune_profile` by editing the `postgresql.conf` file, located in the data directory of your Advanced Server installation. After editing the `postgresql.conf` file, you must restart the server for your changes to take effect.

For more information about `edb_dynatune` and other performance-related topics, see the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server Guide* available from the EnterpriseDB website at:

http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/products/documentation

Click `Next` to continue. The `Update Notification Service` window (shown in Figure 3.11) opens.

![](images/the_update_notification_service_window.png)

<center><i>Figure 3.11 -The Update Notification Service window.</i></center>

When enabled, the update notification service notifies you of any new updates and security patches available for your installation of Advanced Server.

By default, Advanced Server is configured to start the service when the system boots; clear the `Install Update Notification Service` check box, or accept the default, and click `Next` to continue.

The `Pre Installation Summary` opens as shown in Figure 3.12.

![](images/the_pre_installation_summary.png)

<center><i>Figure 3.12 -The Pre Installation Summary.</i></center>

The `Pre Installation Summary` provides an overview of the options specified during the `Setup` process. Review the options before clicking `Next`; click `Back` to navigate back through the dialogs and update any options.

The `Ready to Install` window (see Figure 3.13) confirms that the installer has the information it needs about your configuration preferences to install Advanced Server. Click `Next` to continue.
