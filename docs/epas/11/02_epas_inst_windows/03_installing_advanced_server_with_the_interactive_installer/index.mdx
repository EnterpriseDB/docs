You can use the Advanced Server interactive installer to install Advanced Server on Windows. The interactive installer is available from the EnterpriseDB website at:

https://www.enterprisedb.com/advanced-downloads

You can invoke the graphical installer in different installation modes to perform an Advanced Server installation:

- For information about using the graphical installer, see Section 3.1.
- For information about performing an unattended installation, see Section 3.2.1.
- For information about performing an installation with limited privileges, see Section 3.2.2.
- For information about the command line options you can include when invoking the installer, see Section 3.2.3.

During the installation, the graphical installer copies a number of temporary files to the location specified by the `TEMP` environment variable. You can optionally specify an alternate location for the temporary files by modifying the `TEMP` environment variable.

If invoking the installer from the command line, you can set the value of the variable on the command line. Use the command:

> SET TEMP=`*`tempfilelocation`*

Where *`temp_file_location`* specifies the alternate location for the temporary files.

Please Note: If you are invoking the installer to perform a system upgrade, the installer will preserve the configuration options specified during the previous installation.



***Setting Cluster Preferences during a Graphical Installation***

During an installation, the graphical installer invokes the PostgreSQL `initdb` utility to initialize a cluster. If you are using the graphical installer, you can use the `INITDBOPTS` environment variable to specify your `initdb` preferences. Before invoking the graphical installer, set the value of `INITDBOPTS` at the command line, specifying one or more cluster options. For example:

> `SET INITDBOPTS= -k -E=UTF-8`

If you specify values in `INITDBOPTS` that are also provided by the installer (such as the `–D` option, which specifies the installation directory), the value specified in the graphical installer will supersede the value if specified in `INITDBOPTS`.

For more information about using `initdb` cluster configuration options, see the PostgreSQL Core Documentation available at:

https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/app-initdb.html

In addition to the cluster configuration options documented in the PostgreSQL core documentation, Advanced Server supports the following `initdb` options:

`--no-redwood-compat`

> Include the `--no-redwood-compat` keywords to instruct the server to create the cluster in PostgreSQL mode. When the cluster is created in PostgreSQL mode, the name of the 			database superuser will be `postgres`, the name of the default database will be `postgres`, and Advanced Server’s features compatible with Oracle databases will not be available to the cluster.
>

`--redwood-like`

> Include the `--redwood-like keywords` to instruct the server to use an escape character (an empty string ('')) following the `LIKE` (or PostgreSQL-compatible `ILIKE`) operator in a SQL statement that is compatible with Oracle syntax.
>

`--icu-short-form`

> Include the `--icu-short-form` keywords to create a cluster that uses a default ICU (International Components for Unicode) collation for all databases in the cluster. For more information about Unicode collations, please refer to the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server Guide* available at:
