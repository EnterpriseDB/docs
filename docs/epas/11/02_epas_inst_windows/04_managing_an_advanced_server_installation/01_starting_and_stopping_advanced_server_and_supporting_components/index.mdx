A service is a program that runs in the background and requires no user interaction (in fact, a service provides no user interface); a service can be configured to start at boot time, or manually on demand. Services are best controlled using the platform-specific operating system service control utility. Many of the Advanced Server supporting components are services.

The following table lists the names of the services that control Advanced Server and services that control Advanced Server supporting components:

| Advanced Server Component Name | Windows Service Name                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Advanced Server                | `edb-as-11`                                      |
| pgAgent                        | EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11 Scheduling Agent |
| PgBouncer                      | `edb-pgbouncer-1.7`                              |
| pgPool-II                      | N/A                                              |
| Slony                          | `edb-slony-replication-11`                       |

You can use the command line or the Windows Services applet to control Advanced Server's database server and the services of Advanced Server's supporting components on a Windows host.
