The PL/Python procedural language allows you to create and execute functions written in Python within Postgres applications. The version of PL/Python used by Advanced Server and PostgreSQL is untrusted (`plpython3u`); it offers no restrictions on users to prevent potential security risks.

Install PL/Python in each database (or in a template database) before creating a PL/Python function. You can use the `CREATE LANGUAGE` command at the EDB-PSQL command line to install PL/Python. Use EDB-PSQL to connect to the database in which you wish to install PL/Python, and enter the command:

> `CREATE EXTENSION plpython3u;`

After installing PL/Python in your database, you can use the features of the PL/Python language.

Please note: The indentation shown in the following example must be included as you enter the sample function in EDB-PSQL. The following PL/Python example creates a function named `pymax` that returns the larger of two integer values:

```
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pymax (a integer, b integer) RETURNS integer AS
    $$
        if a > b:
          return a
        return b
    $$ LANGUAGE plpython3u;
```

When calling the `pymax` function, pass two values as shown below:

```
SELECT pymax(12, 3);
```

The server returns:

```
   pymax
  \-------
      12
  (1 row)
```
