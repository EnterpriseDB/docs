Language pack installers contain supported languages that may be used with EDB Postgres Advanced Server and EnterpriseDB PostgreSQL database installers. The language pack installer allows you to install Perl, TCL/TK, and Python without installing supporting software from third party vendors. The Language Pack installer includes:

- TCL with TK version 8.6.8
- Perl version 5.26.2
- Python version 3.6.8

The Perl package contains the `cpan` package manager, and Python contains `pip` and easy_~install package managers. There is no package manager for TCL/TK.

In previous Postgres releases, `plpython` was statically linked with ActiveState's python library. The Language Pack Installer dynamically links with our shared object for python. In ActiveState Linux installers for Python, there is no dynamic library. As a result of these changes, `plpython` will no longer work with ActiveState installers.

This document uses the term *Postgres* to mean either EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB PostgreSQL. For more information about using EDB Postgres products, please visit the EnterpriseDB website at:

StackBuilder Plus is distributed with Advanced Server; Stack Builder (distributed with PostgreSQL) provides comparable functionality. This document uses the term *StackBuilder Plus* to mean either StackBuilder Plus or Stack Builder.

##  Supported Platforms

- EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 11

## Typographical Conventions Used in this Guide

Certain typographical conventions are used in this manual to clarify the meaning and usage of various commands, statements, programs, examples, etc. This section provides a summary of these conventions.

In the following descriptions a *term* refers to any word or group of words which may be language keywords, user-supplied values, literals, etc. A term’s exact meaning depends upon the context in which it is used.

- *Italic font* introduces a new term, typically, in the sentence that defines it for the first time.
- `Fixed-width (mono-spaced) font` is used for terms that must be given literally such as SQL commands, specific table and column names used in the examples, programming language keywords, etc. For example, `SELECT * FROM emp`;

- *`Italic fixed-width font`* is used for terms for which the user must substitute values in actual usage. For example, `DELETE FROM` *`table_name`*;
- A vertical pipe | denotes a choice between the terms on either side of the pipe. A vertical pipe is used to separate two or more alternative terms within square brackets (optional choices) or braces (one mandatory choice).
- Square brackets `[ ]` denote that one or none of the enclosed term(s) may be substituted. For example, `[ a | b ]`, means choose one of “`a`” or “`b`” or neither of the two.
- Braces `{}` denote that exactly one of the enclosed alternatives must be specified. For example, `{ a | b }`, means exactly one of “`a`” or “`b`” must be specified.
- Ellipses ... denote that the proceeding term may be repeated. For example, `[ a | b ]` ... means that you may have the sequence, “`b a a b a`”.
