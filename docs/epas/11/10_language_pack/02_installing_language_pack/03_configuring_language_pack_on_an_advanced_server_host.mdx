After installing Language Pack on an Advanced Server host, you must configure the installation.

***Configuring Language Pack on Windows***

On Windows, the Language Pack installer places the languages in:

> `C:\edb\languagepack-11\x64`

After installing Language Pack, you must set the following variables:

> `set PYTHONHOME=C:\edb\languagepack-11\x64\Python-3.6.`

Use the following commands to add Python, Perl and Tcl to your search path:

> `set PATH= C:\edb\LanguagePack-11\x64\Python-3.6;`
> `C:\edb\LanguagePack-11\x64\Perl-5.26\bin;`
> `C:\edb\LanguagePack-11\x64\Tcl-8.6\bin;%PATH%`

After performing the steps required to configure Language Pack on Windows, use the Windows `Services` applet to restart the Advanced Server database server.
