**Name**

`SAVEPOINT` -- define a new savepoint within the current transaction

**Synopsis**

`SAVEPOINT` *`savepoint_name`*

**Description**

`SAVEPOINT` establishes a new savepoint within the current transaction.

A savepoint is a special mark inside a transaction that allows all commands that are executed after it was established to be rolled back, restoring the transaction state to what it was at the time of the savepoint.

**Parameters**

*`savepoint_name`*

> The name to be given to the savepoint.

**Notes**

Use `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` to roll back to a savepoint.

Savepoints can only be established when inside a transaction block. There can be multiple savepoints defined within a transaction.

When another savepoint is established with the same name as a previous savepoint, the old savepoint is kept, though only the more recent one will be used when rolling back.

`SAVEPOINT` is not supported within SPL programs.

**Examples**

To establish a savepoint and later undo the effects of all commands executed after it was established:

```
\set AUTOCOMMIT off
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50, 'HR', 'NEW YORK');
SAVEPOINT depts;
INSERT INTO emp (empno, ename, deptno) VALUES (9001, 'JONES', 50);
INSERT INTO emp (empno, ename, deptno) VALUES (9002, 'ALICE', 50);
SAVEPOINT emps;
INSERT INTO jobhist VALUES (9001,'17-SEP-07',NULL,'CLERK',800,NULL,50,'New Hire');
INSERT INTO jobhist VALUES (9002,'20-SEP-07',NULL,'CLERK',700,NULL,50,'New Hire');
ROLLBACK TO depts;
COMMIT;
```

The above transaction will commit a row into the `dept` table, but the inserts into the `emp` and `jobhist` tables are rolled back.
