This variant of the `GRANT` command gives a role the ability to perform certain *system* operations within a database. System privileges relate to the ability to create or delete certain database objects that are not necessarily within the confines of one schema. Only database superusers can grant system privileges.

`CREATE [PUBLIC] DATABASE LINK`

The `CREATE [PUBLIC] DATABASE LINK` privilege allows the specified role to create a database link. Include the `PUBLIC` keyword to allow the role to create public database links; omit the `PUBLIC` keyword to allow the specified role to create private database links.

`DROP PUBLIC DATABASE LINK`

The `DROP PUBLIC DATABASE LINK` privilege allows a role to drop a public database link. System privileges are not required to drop a private database link. A private database link may be dropped by the link owner or a database superuser.

`EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY`

The `EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY` privilege allows a role to execute a SQL command without invoking any policy function that may be associated with the target database object. That is, the role is exempt from all security policies in the database.

The `EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY` privilege is not inheritable by membership to a role that has the EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY privilege. For example, the following sequence of `GRANT` commands does not result in user `joe` obtaining the `EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY` privilege even though `joe` is granted membership to the `enterprisedb` role, which has been granted the `EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY` privilege:

```
GRANT EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY TO enterprisedb;
GRANT enterprisedb TO joe;
```

The `rolpolicyexempt` column of the system catalog table `pg_authid` is set to true if a role has the `EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY` privilege.

**Examples**

Grant `CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK` privilege to user `joe`:

```
GRANT CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK TO joe;
```

Grant `DROP PUBLIC DATABASE LINK` privilege to user `joe`:

```
GRANT DROP PUBLIC DATABASE LINK TO joe;
```

Grant the `EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY` privilege to user `joe`:

```
GRANT EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY TO joe;
```

**Using the ALTER ROLE Command to Assign System Privileges**

The Advanced Server `ALTER ROLE` command also supports syntax that you can use to assign:

- the privilege required to create a public or private database link.
- the privilege required to drop a public database link.
- the `EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY` privilege.

The `ALTER ROLE` syntax is functionally equivalent to the respective commands compatible with Oracle databases.
