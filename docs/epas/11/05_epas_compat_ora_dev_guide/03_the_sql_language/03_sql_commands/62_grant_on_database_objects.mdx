This variant of the `GRANT` command gives specific privileges on a database object to a role. These privileges are added to those already granted, if any.

The key word `PUBLIC` indicates that the privileges are to be granted to all roles, including those that may be created later. `PUBLIC` may be thought of as an implicitly defined group that always includes all roles. Any particular role will have the sum of privileges granted directly to it, privileges granted to any role it is presently a member of, and privileges granted to `PUBLIC`.

If the `WITH GRANT OPTION` is specified, the recipient of the privilege may in turn grant it to others. Without a grant option, the recipient cannot do that. Grant options cannot be granted to `PUBLIC`.

There is no need to grant privileges to the owner of an object (usually the user that created it), as the owner has all privileges by default. (The owner could, however, choose to revoke some of his own privileges for safety.) The right to drop an object or to alter its definition in any way is not described by a grantable privilege; it is inherent in the owner, and cannot be granted or revoked. The owner implicitly has all grant options for the object as well.

Depending on the type of object, the initial default privileges may include granting some privileges to `PUBLIC`. The default is no public access for tables and `EXECUTE` privilege for functions, procedures, and packages. The object owner may of course revoke these privileges. (For maximum security, issue the `REVOKE` in the same transaction that creates the object; then there is no window in which another user may use the object.)

The possible privileges are:

`SELECT`

> Allows `SELECT` from any column of the specified table, view, or sequence. For sequences, this privilege also allows the use of the `currval` function.

`INSERT`

> Allows `INSERT` of a new row into the specified table.

`UPDATE`

> Allows `UPDATE` of a column of the specified table. `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` also requires this privilege (besides the `SELECT` privilege).

`DELETE`

> Allows `DELETE` of a row from the specified table.

`REFERENCES`

> To create a foreign key constraint, it is necessary to have this privilege on both the referencing and referenced tables.

`EXECUTE`

> Allows the use of the specified package, procedure, or function. When applied to a package, allows the use of all of the packageâ€™s public procedures, public functions, public variables, records, cursors and other public objects and object types. This is the only type of privilege that is applicable to functions, procedures, and packages.
>
> The Advanced Server syntax for granting the `EXECUTE` privilege is not fully compatible with Oracle databases. Advanced Server requires qualification of the program name by one of the keywords, `FUNCTION`, `PROCEDURE`, or `PACKAGE` whereas these keywords must be omitted in Oracle. For functions, Advanced Server requires all input (`IN`, `IN OUT`) argument data types after the function name (including an empty parenthesis if there are no function arguments). For procedures, all input argument data types must be specified if the procedure has one or more input arguments. In Oracle, function and procedure signatures must be omitted. This is due to the fact that all programs share the same namespace in Oracle, whereas functions, procedures, and packages have their own individual namespace in Advanced Server to allow program name overloading to a certain extent.
