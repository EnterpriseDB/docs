This variant of the `GRANT` command grants membership in a role to one or more other roles. Membership in a role is significant because it conveys the privileges granted to a role to each of its members.

If the `WITH ADMIN OPTION` is specified, the member may in turn grant membership in the role to others, and revoke membership in the role as well. Without the admin option, ordinary users cannot do that.

Database superusers can grant or revoke membership in any role to anyone. Roles having the `CREATEROLE` privilege can grant or revoke membership in any role that is not a superuser.

There are three pre-defined roles that have the following meanings:

`CONNECT`

> Granting the `CONNECT` role is equivalent to giving the grantee the `LOGIN` privilege. The grantor must have the `CREATEROLE` privilege.

`RESOURCE`

> Granting the `RESOURCE` role is equivalent to granting the `CREATE` and `USAGE` privileges on a schema that has the same name as the grantee. This schema must exist before the grant is given. The grantor must have the privilege to grant `CREATE` or `USAGE` privileges on this schema to the grantee.

`DBA`

> Granting the `DBA` role is equivalent to making the grantee a superuser. The grantor must be a superuser.

**Notes**

The `REVOKE` command is used to revoke access privileges.

When a non-owner of an object attempts to `GRANT` privileges on the object, the command will fail outright if the user has no privileges whatsoever on the object. As long as a privilege is available, the command will proceed, but it will grant only those privileges for which the user has grant options. The `GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES` forms will issue a warning message if no grant options are held, while the other forms will issue a warning if grant options for any of the privileges specifically named in the command are not held. (In principle these statements apply to the object owner as well, but since the owner is always treated as holding all grant options, the cases can never occur.)

It should be noted that database superusers can access all objects regardless of object privilege settings. This is comparable to the rights of `root` in a Unix system. As with `root`, itâ€™s unwise to operate as a superuser except when absolutely necessary.

If a superuser chooses to issue a `GRANT` or `REVOKE` command, the command is performed as though it were issued by the owner of the affected object. In particular, privileges granted via such a command will appear to have been granted by the object owner. (For role membership, the membership appears to have been granted by the containing role itself.)

`GRANT` and `REVOKE` can also be done by a role that is not the owner of the affected object, but is a member of the role that owns the object, or is a member of a role that holds privileges `WITH GRANT OPTION` on the object. In this case the privileges will be recorded as having been granted by the role that actually owns the object or holds the privileges `WITH GRANT OPTION`.

> For example, if table `t1` is owned by role `g1`, of which role `u1` is a member, then `u1` can grant privileges on `t1` to `u2`, but those privileges will appear to have been granted directly by `g1`. Any other member of role `g1` could revoke them later.

If the role executing `GRANT` holds the required privileges indirectly via more than one role membership path, it is unspecified which containing role will be recorded as having done the grant. In such cases it is best practice to use `SET ROLE` to become the specific role you want to do the `GRANT` as.

Currently, Advanced Server does not support granting or revoking privileges for individual columns of a table. One possible workaround is to create a view having just the desired columns and then grant privileges to that view.

**Examples**

Grant insert privilege to all users on table `emp`:

```
GRANT INSERT ON emp TO PUBLIC;
```

Grant all available privileges to user `mary` on view `salesemp`:

```
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON salesemp TO mary;
```

Note that while the above will indeed grant all privileges if executed by a superuser or the owner of `emp`, when executed by someone else it will only grant those permissions for which the someone else has grant options.

Grant membership in role `admins` to user `joe`:

```
GRANT admins TO joe;
```

Grant `CONNECT` privilege to user `joe`:

```
GRANT CONNECT TO joe;
```
