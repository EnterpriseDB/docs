The following database compatibility for Oracle features have been added to Advanced Server 10 to create Advanced Server 11:

- Advanced Server now supports SPL standalone procedure overloading. Note that this feature is not compatible with Oracle databases. For more information, see Section 2.3.25.
- Advanced Server now supports the PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION directive within any SPL block to provide the autonomous transaction capability. For information, see the Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer’s Guide. For affected SPL programs, see sections 2.3.20, 2.3.24, 2.3.25, 2.3.35, and 2.3.37.
