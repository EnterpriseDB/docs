On Windows, ECPGPlus is installed by the Advanced Server installation wizard as part of the `Database Server` component. On Linux, install with the `edb-as*xx*-server-devel` RPM package where *xx* is the Advanced Server version number. By default, on a Linux installation, the executable is located in:

> > `/usr/edb/as11/bin`
>
> On Windows, the executable is located in:
>
> > `C:\Program Files\edb\as11\bin`

When invoking the ECPGPlus compiler, the executable must be in your search path (`%PATH%` on Windows, `$PATH` on Linux). For example, the following commands set the search path to include the directory that holds the ECPGPlus executable file `ecpg`.

> On Windows:
>
> > `set EDB_PATH=C:\Program Files\edb\as11\bin`
> > `set PATH=%EDB_PATH%;%PATH%`
>
> On Linux:
>
> > `export EDB_PATH==/usr/edb/as11/bin`
> > `export PATH=$EDB_PATH:$PATH`
