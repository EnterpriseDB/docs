The following examples demonstrate four techniques for building and executing dynamic SQL statements. Each example demonstrates processing a different combination of statement and input types:

- The first example demonstrates processing and executing a SQL statement that does not contain a `SELECT` statement and does not require input variables. This example corresponds to the techniques used by Oracle Dynamic SQL Method 1.
- The second example demonstrates processing and executing a SQL statement that does not contain a `SELECT` statement, and contains a known number of input variables. This example corresponds to the techniques used by Oracle Dynamic SQL Method 2.
- The third example demonstrates processing and executing a SQL statement that may contain a `SELECT` statement, and includes a known number of input variables. This example corresponds to the techniques used by Oracle Dynamic SQL Method 3.
- The fourth example demonstrates processing and executing a SQL statement that may contain a `SELECT` statement, and includes an unknown number of input variables. This example corresponds to the techniques used by Oracle Dynamic SQL Method 4.
