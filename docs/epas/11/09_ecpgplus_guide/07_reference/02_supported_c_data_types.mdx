An ECPGPlus application must deal with two sets of data types: SQL data types (such as `SMALLINT`, `DOUBLE PRECISION` and `CHARACTER VARYING`) and C data types (like `short`, `double` and `varchar[`*`n`*`]`). When an application fetches data from the server, ECPGPlus will map each SQL data type to the type of the C variable into which the data is returned.

In general, ECPGPlus can convert most SQL server types into similar C types, but not all combinations are valid. For example, ECPGPlus will try to convert a SQL character value into a C integer value, but the conversion may fail (at execution time) if the SQL character value contains non-numeric characters. The reverse is also true; when an application sends a value to the server, ECPGPlus will try to convert the C data type into the required SQL type. Again, the conversion may fail (at execution time) if the C value cannot be converted into the required SQL type.

ECPGPlus can convert any SQL type into C character values (`char[`*`n`*`]` or `varchar[`*`n`*`]`). Although it is safe to convert any SQL type to/from `char[`*`n`*`]` or `varchar[`*`n`*`]`, it is often convenient to use more natural C types such as `int`, `double`, or float.

The supported C data types are:

- `short`
- `int`
- `unsigned int`
- `long long int`
- `float`
- `double`
- `char[n+1]`
- `varchar[n+1]`
- `bool`
- and any equivalent created by a `typedef`

In addition to the numeric and character types supported by C, the `pgtypeslib` run-time library offers custom data types (and functions to operate on those types) for dealing with date/time and exact numeric values:

- `timestamp`
- `interval`
- `date`
- `decimal`
- `numeric`

To use a data type supplied by `pgtypeslib`, you must `#include` the proper header file.
