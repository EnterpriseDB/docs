Prepared statements are useful when a client application must perform a task multiple times; the statement is parsed, written and planned only once, rather than each time the statement is executed, saving repetitive processing time.

Use the `PREPARE` statement to prepare an SQL statement or PL/pgSQL block for execution. The statement is available in two forms; the first form is:

> `EXEC SQL [AT` *`database_name`*`] PREPARE` *statement_name*
>   FROM *`sql_statement`*;

The second form is:

> `EXEC SQL [AT` *`database_name`*`] PREPARE` *`statement_name`*
>   `AS` *`sql_statement`*;

Where:

*`database_name`* is the database identifier or a host variable that contains the database identifier against which the statement will execute. If you omit the `AT` clause, the statement will execute against the current default database.

*`statement_name`* is the identifier associated with a prepared SQL statement or PL/SQL block.

*`sql_statement`* may take the form of a `SELECT` statement, a single-quoted string literal or host variable that contains the text of an SQL statement.

To include variables within a prepared statement, substitute placeholders (`$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc.) for statement values that might change when you `PREPARE` the statement. When you `EXECUTE` the statement, provide a value for each parameter. The values must be provided in the order in which they will replace placeholders.

The following example creates a prepared statement (named `add_emp`) that inserts a record into the `emp` table:

> `EXEC SQL PREPARE add_emp (int, text, text, numeric) AS`
>
> â€‹    `INSERT INTO emp VALUES($1, $2, $3, $4);`

Each time you invoke the statement, provide fresh parameter values for the statement:

> `EXEC SQL EXECUTE add_emp(8003, 'Davis', 'CLERK', 2000.00);`
>
> `EXEC SQL EXECUTE add_emp(8004, 'Myer', 'CLERK', 2000.00);`

Please note: A client application must issue a `PREPARE` statement within each session in which a statement will be executed; prepared statements persist only for the duration of the current session.
