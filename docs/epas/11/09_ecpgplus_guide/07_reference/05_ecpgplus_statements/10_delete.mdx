Use the `DELETE` statement to delete one or more rows from a table. The syntax for the ECPGPlus `DELETE` statement is the same as the syntax for the SQL statement, but you can use parameter markers and host variables any place that an expression is allowed. The syntax is:

> `[FOR` *`exec_count`*`] DELETE FROM [ONLY]` *`table`* `[[AS]` *`alias`*`]`
>
>   `[USING` *`using_list`*`]`
>
>   `[WHERE` *`condition`* `| WHERE CURRENT OF` *`cursor_name`*]
>   `[{RETURNING|RETURN} * |` *`output_expression`* `[[ AS]` *`output_name`*`] [, ...] INTO` *`host_variable_list`* `]`

Where:

Include the `FOR` *`exec_count`* clause to specify the number of times the statement will execute; this clause is valid only if the `VALUES` clause references an array or a pointer to an array.

*`table`* is the name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing table. Include the `ONLY` clause to limit processing to the specified table; if you do not include the `ONLY` clause, any tables inheriting from the named table are also processed.

*`alias`* is a substitute name for the target table.

*`using_list`* is a list of table expressions, allowing columns from other tables to appear in the WHERE condition.

Include the `WHERE` clause to specify which rows should be deleted. If you do not include a `WHERE` clause in the statement, `DELETE` will delete all rows from the table, leaving the table definition intact.

*`condition`* is an expression, host variable or parameter marker that returns a value of type `BOOLEAN`. Those rows for which *`condition`* returns true will be deleted.

*`cursor_name`* is the name of the cursor to use in the `WHERE CURRENT OF` clause; the row to be deleted will be the one most recently fetched from this cursor. The cursor must be a non-grouping query on the `DELETE` statements target table. You cannot specify `WHERE CURRENT OF` in a `DELETE` statement that includes a Boolean condition.

The `RETURN/RETURNING` clause specifies an *`output_expression`* or *`host_variable_list`* that is returned by the `DELETE` command after each row is deleted:

> *`output_expression`* is an expression to be computed and returned by the `DELETE` command after each row is deleted. *`output_name`* is the name of the returned column; include * to return all columns.
>
> *`host_variable_list`* is a comma-separated list of host variables and optional indicator variables. Each host variable receives a corresponding value from the `RETURNING` clause.

For example, the following statement deletes all rows from the `emp` table where the `sal` column contains a value greater than the value specified in the host variable, `:max_sal`:

> `DELETE FROM emp WHERE sal > :max_sal;`
