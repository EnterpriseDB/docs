Use the `DISCONNECT` statement to close the connection to the server. The syntax is:

> `EXEC SQL DISCONNECT` \[*`connection_name`*]\[`CURRENT`]\[`DEFAULT`][`ALL`];

Where:

*`connection_name`* is the connection name specified in the `CONNECT` statement used to establish the connection. If you do not specify a connection name, the current connection is closed.

Include the `CURRENT` keyword to specify that ECPGPlus should close the most-recently used connection.

Include the `DEFAULT` keyword to specify that ECPGPlus should close the connection named `DEFAULT`. If you do not specify a name when opening a connection, ECPGPlus assigns the name, `DEFAULT`, to the connection.

Include the `ALL` keyword to instruct ECPGPlus to close all active connections.

The following example creates a connection (named `hr_connection`) that connects to the `hr` database, and then disconnects from the connection:

> `/* client.pgc*/`
>
> `int main()`
>
> `{`
>
> ​    `EXEC SQL CONNECT TO hr AS connection_name;`
>
> ​    `EXEC SQL DISCONNECT connection_name;`
>
> ​    `return(0);`
>
> `}`
