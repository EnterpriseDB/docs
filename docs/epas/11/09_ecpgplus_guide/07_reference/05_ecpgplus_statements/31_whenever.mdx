Use the `WHENEVER` statement to specify the action taken by a client application when it encounters an SQL error or warning. The syntax is:

> `EXEC SQL WHENEVER` *`condition action`*`;`

The following table describes the different conditions that might trigger an *`action`*:

| Condition    | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `NOT FOUND`  | The server returns a `NOT FOUND` condition when it encounters a `SELECT` that returns no rows, or when a `FETCH` reaches the end of a result set. |
| `SQLERROR`   | The server returns an `SQLERROR` condition when it encounters a serious error returned by an SQL statement. |
| `SQLWARNING` | The server returns an `SQLWARNING` condition when it encounters a non-fatal warning returned by an SQL statement. |

The following table describes the actions that result from a client encountering a *`condition`*:

| Action                                | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `CALL` *`function`*`[([`*`args`*`])]` | Instructs the client application to call the named *`function`*. |
| `CONTINUE`                            | Instructs the client application to proceed to the next statement. |
| `DO BREAK`                            | Instructs the client application to a C break statement. A break statement may appear in a `loop` or a `switch` statement. If executed, the break statement terminate the `loop` or the `switch` statement.. |
| `DO CONTINUE`                         | Instructs the client application to emit a C `continue` statement. A `continue` statement may only exist within a loop, and if executed, will cause the flow of control to return to the top of the loop. |
| `DO` *`function`*`([`*`args`*`])`     | Instructs the client application to call the named *`function`*. |
| `GOTO` *`label`* `or GO TO` *`label`* | Instructs the client application to proceed to the statement that contains the *`label`*. |
| `SQLPRINT`                            | Instructs the client application to print a message to standard error. |
| `STOP`                                | Instructs the client application to stop execution.          |

The following code fragment prints a message if the client application encounters a warning, and aborts the application if it encounters an error:

> `EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLWARNING SQLPRINT;`
>
> `EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR STOP;`

Include the following code to specify that a client should continue processing after warning a user of a problem:

> `EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLWARNING SQLPRINT;`

Include the following code to call a function if a query returns no rows, or when a cursor reaches the end of a result set:

> `EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND CALL error_handler(__LINE__);`
