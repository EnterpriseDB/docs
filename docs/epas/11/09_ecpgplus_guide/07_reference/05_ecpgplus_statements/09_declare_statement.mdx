Use the `DECLARE STATEMENT` directive to declare an identifier for an SQL statement. Advanced Server supports two versions of the `DECLARE STATEMENT` directive:

> `EXEC SQL [`*`database_name`*`] DECLARE` *`statement_name`* `STATEMENT;`
>
> and
>
> `EXEC SQL DECLARE STATEMENT` *`statement_name`*;

Where:

*`statement_name`* specifies the identifier associated with the statement.

*`database_name`* specifies the name of the database. This value may take the form of an identifier or of a host variable that contains the identifier.

A typical usage sequence that includes the `DECLARE STATEMENT` directive might be:

> `EXEC SQL DECLARE give_raise STATEMENT;      // give_raise is now a statement handle (not prepared)`
>
> `EXEC SQL PREPARE give_raise FROM :stmtText; // give_raise is now associated with a statement`
>
> `EXEC SQL EXECUTE give_raise;`

This statement has no effect and is provided for Pro*C compatibility only.
