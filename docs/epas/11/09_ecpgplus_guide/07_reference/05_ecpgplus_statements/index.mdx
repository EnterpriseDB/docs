An embedded SQL statement allows your client application to interact with the server, while an embedded directive is an instruction to the ECPGPlus compiler.

You can embed any Advanced Server SQL statement in a C program. Each statement should begin with the keywords EXEC SQL, and must be terminated with a semi-colon (;). Within the C program, a SQL statement takes the form:

`EXEC SQL` *`sql_command_body`*`;`

Where *`sql_command_body`* represents a standard SQL statement. You can use a host variable anywhere that the SQL statement expects a value expression. For more information about substituting host variables for value expressions, please see [Section 3.1.2](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/user-guides/ecpgplus-guide/11/EDB_Postgres_Advanced_Server_ecpgPlus_Guide.1.11.html#), *Declaring Host Variables*.

ECPGPlus extends the PostgreSQL server-side syntax for some statements; for those statements, syntax differences are outlined in the following reference sections. For a complete reference to the supported syntax of other SQL commands, please refer to the *PostgreSQL* *Core* *Documentation* available at:
