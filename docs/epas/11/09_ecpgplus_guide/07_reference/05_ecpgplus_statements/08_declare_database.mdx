Use the `DECLARE DATABASE` statement to declare a database identifier for use in subsequent SQL statements (for example, in a `CONNECT` statement). The syntax is:

> `EXEC SQL DECLARE` *`database_name`* `DATABASE`;

Where:

*`database_name`* specifies the name of the database.

The following example demonstrates declaring an identifier for the `acctg` database:

> `EXEC SQL DECLARE acctg DATABASE;`

After invoking the command declaring `acctg` as a database identifier, the `acctg` database can be referenced by name when establishing a connection or in AT clauses.
