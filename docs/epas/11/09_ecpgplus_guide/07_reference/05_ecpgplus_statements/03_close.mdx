Use the `CLOSE` statement to close a cursor, and free any resources currently in use by the cursor. A client application cannot fetch rows from a closed cursor. The syntax of the `CLOSE` statement is:

> `EXEC SQL CLOSE [`*`cursor_name`*`];`

Where:

*`cursor_name`* is the name of the cursor closed by the statement. The cursor name may take the form of an identifier or of a host variable.

The `OPEN` statement initializes a cursor. Once initialized, a cursor result set will remain unchanged unless the cursor is re-opened. You do not need to `CLOSE` a cursor before re-opening it.

To manually close a cursor named `emp_cursor`, use the command:

> `EXEC SQL CLOSE emp_cursor;`

A cursor is automatically closed when an application terminates.
