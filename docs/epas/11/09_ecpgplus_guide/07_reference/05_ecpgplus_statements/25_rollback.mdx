Use the `ROLLBACK` statement to abort the current transaction, and discard any updates made by the transaction. The syntax is:

> `EXEC SQL [AT` *`database_name`*`] ROLLBACK [WORK]`
>   `[ { TO [SAVEPOINT]` *`savepoint`* `} | RELEASE ]`

Where:

*`database_name`* is the database identifier or a host variable that contains the database identifier against which the statement will execute. If you omit the `AT` clause, the statement will execute against the current default database.

Include the `TO` clause to abort any commands that were executed after the specified *`savepoint`*; use the `SAVEPOINT` statement to define the *`savepoint`*. If you omit the `TO` clause, the `ROLLBACK` statement will abort the transaction, discarding all updates.

Include the `RELEASE` clause to cause the application to execute an `EXEC SQL COMMIT RELEASE` and close the connection.

Use the following statement to rollback a complete transaction:

> `EXEC SQL ROLLBACK;`

Invoking this statement will abort the transaction, undoing all changes, erasing any savepoints, and releasing all transaction locks. If you include a savepoint (`my_savepoint` in the following example):

> `EXEC SQL ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;`

Only the portion of the transaction that occurred after the `my_savepoint` is rolled back; `my_savepoint` is retained, but any savepoints created after `my_savepoint` will be erased.

Rolling back to a specified savepoint releases all locks acquired after the savepoint.
