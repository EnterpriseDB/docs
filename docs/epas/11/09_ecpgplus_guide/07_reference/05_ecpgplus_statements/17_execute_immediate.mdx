Use the `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` statement to execute a string that contains a SQL command. The syntax is:

> `EXEC SQL [AT` *`database_name`*`] EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` *`command_text`*;

Where:

*`database_name`* is the database identifier or a host variable that contains the database identifier. If you omit the AT clause, the statement will be executed on the current default database.

*`command_text`* is the command executed by the `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` statement.

This dynamic SQL statement is useful when you don't know the text of an SQL statement (ie., when writing a client application). For example, a client application may prompt a (trusted) user for a statement to execute. After the user provides the text of the statement as a string value, the statement is then executed with an `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` command.

The statement text may not contain references to host variables. If the statement may contain parameter markers or returns one or more values, you must use the `PREPARE` and `DESCRIBE` statements.

The following example executes the command contained in the `:command_text` host variable:

> `EXEC SQL EXECUTE IMMEDIATE :command_text;`
