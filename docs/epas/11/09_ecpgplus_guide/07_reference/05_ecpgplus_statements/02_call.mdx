Use the `CALL` statement to invoke a procedure or function on the server. The `CALL` statement works only on Advanced Server. The `CALL` statement comes in two forms; the first form is used to call a *`function`*:

> `EXEC SQL CALL` *program**`name`* `'('[`*`actual_arguments`*`]')'`
>   `INTO [[:`*`ret_variable`*`][:`*`ret_indicator`*`]];`

The second form is used to call a *procedure*:

> `EXEC SQL CALL` *`program_name`* `'('[`*`actual_arguments`*`]')';`

Where:

*`program_name`* is the name of the stored procedure or function that the `CALL` statement invokes. The program name may be schema-qualified or package-qualified (or both); if you do not specify the schema or package in which the program resides, ECPGPlus will use the value of `search_path` to locate the program.

*`actual_arguments`* specifies a comma-separated list of arguments required by the program. Note that each *`actual_argument`* corresponds to a formal argument expected by the program. Each formal argument may be an IN parameter, an `OUT` parameter, or an `INOUT` parameter.

:*`ret_variable`* specifies a host variable that will receive the value returned if the program is a function.

:*`ret_indicator`* specifies a host variable that will receive the indicator value returned, if the program is a function.

For example, the following statement invokes the `get_job_desc` function with the value contained in the :`ename` host variable, and captures the value returned by that function in the :`job` host variable:

> `EXEC SQL CALL get_job_desc(:ename)`
>   `INTO :job;`
