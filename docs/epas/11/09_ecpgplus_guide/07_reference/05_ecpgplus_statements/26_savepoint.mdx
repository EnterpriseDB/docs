Use the `SAVEPOINT` statement to define a *savepoint*; a savepoint is a marker within a transaction. You can use a `ROLLBACK` statement to abort the current transaction, returning the state of the server to its condition prior to the specified savepoint. The syntax of a `SAVEPOINT` statement is:

> `EXEC SQL [AT` *`database_name`*`] SAVEPOINT` *`savepoint_name`*

Where:

*`database_name`* is the database identifier or a host variable that contains the database identifier against which the savepoint resides. If you omit the `AT` clause, the statement will execute against the current default database.

*`savepoint_name`* is the name of the savepoint. If you re-use a *`savepoint_name`*, the original savepoint is discarded.

Savepoints can only be established within a transaction block. A transaction block may contain multiple savepoints.

To create a savepoint named `my_savepoint`, include the statement:

> `EXEC SQL SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;`
