Use the `COMMIT` statement to complete the current transaction, making all changes permanent and visible to other users. The syntax is:

`EXEC SQL [AT` *`database_name`*`] COMMIT [WORK]`
         `[COMMENT` *'`text`'*`] [COMMENT` *'`text`'* `RELEASE];`

Where:

*`database_name`* is the name of the database (or host variable that contains the name of the database) in which the work resides. This value may take the form of an unquoted string literal, or of a host variable.

For compatibility, ECPGPlus accepts the `COMMENT` clause without error but does *not* store any text included with the `COMMENT` clause.

Include the `RELEASE` clause to close the current connection after performing the commit.

For example, the following command commits all work performed on the `dept` database and closes the current connection:

> `EXEC SQL AT dept COMMIT RELEASE;`

By default, statements are committed only when a client application performs a `COMMIT` statement. Include the `-t` option when invoking ECPGPlus to specify that a client application should invoke `AUTOCOMMIT` functionality. You can also control `AUTOCOMMIT` functionality in a client application with the following statements:

> `EXEC SQL SET AUTOCOMMIT TO ON`
>
> and
>
> `EXEC SQL SET AUTOCOMMIT TO OFF`
