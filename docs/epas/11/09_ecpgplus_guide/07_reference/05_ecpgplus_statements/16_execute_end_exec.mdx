Use the `EXECUTE…END-EXEC` statement to embed an anonymous block into a client application. The syntax is:

> `EXEC SQL [AT` *`database_name`*`] EXECUTE` *`anonymous_block`* `END-EXEC;`

Where:

*`database_name`* is the database identifier or a host variable that contains the database identifier. If you omit the `AT` clause, the statement will be executed on the current default database.

*`anonymous_block`* is an inline sequence of PL/pgSQL or SPL statements and declarations. You may include host variables and optional indicator variables within the block; each such variable is treated as an `IN/OUT` value.

The following example executes an anonymous block:

> `EXEC SQL EXECUTE` 
>   `BEGIN`
>     `IF (current_user = :admin_user_name) THEN`
>       `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('You are an administrator');`
>     `END IF;` 
> `END-EXEC;`

Please Note: the `EXECUTE…END EXEC` statement is supported only by Advanced Server.
