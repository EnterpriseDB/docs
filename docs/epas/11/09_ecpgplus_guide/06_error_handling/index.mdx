ECPGPlus provides two methods to detect and handle errors in embedded SQL code:

- A client application can examine the `sqlca` data structure for error messages, and supply customized error handling for your client application.
- A client application can include `EXEC SQL WHENEVER` directives to instruct the ECPGPlus compiler to add error-handling code.
