  # this serves to allow building PDFs to be optional without preventing deployment,

  # there are ways to do this in conditions on a single job, but this keeps things clear
  # this job will fail only if build-pdfs failed (not if it was skipped)
  # however, it will set an output - check-has-pdfs.steps.check.has-pdfs - true if PDFs were generated
