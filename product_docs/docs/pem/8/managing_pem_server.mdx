The sections that follow provide information about tasks related to PEM server such as restarting the PEM server and agent, controlling the PEM server or PEM agent, controlling the HTTPD service on Linux and Windows, controlling the HTTPD server, managing PEM authentication and security, modifying the `pg_hba.conf` file, modifying PEM to use a proxy server etc.

## Starting and stopping the PEM server and agents

The PEM server starts, stops and restarts when the Postgres server instance on which it resides starts, stops or restarts; use the same commands to control the PEM server that you would use to control the Postgres server. On Linux platforms, the command that stops and starts the service script will vary by platform and OS version.

The PEM agent is controlled by a service named `pemagent`.

The Windows operating system includes a graphical service controller that displays the server status, and offers point-and-click server control. The `Services` utility can be accessed through the Windows `Control Panel`. When the utility opens, use the scroll bar to navigate through the listed services to highlight the service name.

![The PEM service in the Windows Services window](/images/pem_services_windows_server_agent.png)

Use the `Stop`, `Pause`, `Start`, or `Restart` buttons to control the state of the service.

Please note that any user (or client application) connected to the Postgres server will be abruptly disconnected if you stop the service. For more information about controlling a service, please consult the [*EDB Postgres Advanced Server Installation Guide*](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/), available from the EDB website.

## Controlling the PEM server or PEM agent on Linux

On Linux platforms, the name of the service script that controls:

-   a PEM server on Advanced Server is `edb-as-<x>` or `ppas-<x>`
-   a PEM server on PostgreSQL is `postgresql-<x>`
-   a PEM agent is `pemagent`

Where `x` indicates the server version number.

You can use the service script to control the service.

-   To control a service on RHEL or CentOS version 7.x or 8.x open a command line, assume superuser privileges, and issue the command:

    ```text
    systemctl <service_name> <action>
    ```

Where:

`service_name` is the name of the service.

`action` specifies the action taken by the service. Specify:

-   `start` to start the service.
-   `stop` to stop the service.
-   `restart` to stop and then start the service.
-   `status` to check the status of the service.

## Controlling the PEM server or PEM agent on Windows

The Windows operating system includes a graphical service controller that displays the server status, and offers point-and-click server control. The registered name of the service that controls:

-   a PEM server host on PostgreSQL is `postgresql-<x>`
-   a PEM server host on Advanced Server is `edb-as-<x>`, or `ppas-<x>`
-   a PEM agent is `Postgres Enterprise Manager - pemAgent`

Where `x` indicates the server version number.

Navigate through the Windows `Control Panel` to open the `Services` utility. When the utility opens, use the scroll bar to browse the list of services.

![The Windows Services window](/images/pem_services_windows_server_agent.png)

Use the `Stop the service` option to stop a service. Any user (or client application) connected to the server will be abruptly disconnected if you stop the service.

Use the `Pause the service` option to instruct Postgres to reload a service's configuration parameters. The `Pause the service` option is an effective way to reset parameters without disrupting user sessions for many of the configuration parameters.

Use the `Start the service` option to start a service.

## Controlling the HTTPD server

On Linux, you can confirm the status of the `PEM-HTTPD` service by opening a command line, and entering the following command:

```text
ps -ef | grep httpd
```

If Linux responds with an answer that is similar to the following example, `httpd` is not running:

```text
user 13321 13267 0 07:37 pts/1 00:00:00 grep httpd
```

To start the service on a CentOS or RHEL 7.x or 8.x system, use the command:

```text
systemctl start httpd
```

On Windows, you can use the `Services` applet to check the status of the `PEM HTTPD` service. After opening the Services applet, scroll through the list to locate the `PEM HTTPD` service.

![The PEM HTTPD Windows service](/images/pem_services_httpd.png)

The `Status` column displays the current state of the server. Click the `Start` link to start `PEM HTTPD` if the service is not running.

## Managing PEM authentication

Postgres supports a number of authentication methods:

-   Secure password (md5)
-   GSSAPI
-   SSPI
-   Kerberos
-   Ident
-   LDAP
-   RADIUS
-   Certificate (SSL)
-   PAM

Postgres (and PEM) authentication is controlled by the `pg_hba.conf` configuration file. Entries within the configuration file specify who may connect to a specific database, and the type of authentication required before that user is allowed to connect.

A typical entry in the `pg_hba.conf` file that allows a user named `postgres` to connect to all databases from the local host (127.0.0.1/32) using secure password (md5) authentication connections would take the form:

`host all postgres 127.0.0.1/32 md5`

Depending on your system's configuration, you may also need to create a password file for the user account that the PEM agent uses to connect to the server, to allow the agent to properly respond to the server’s authentication request. An entry in the password file for a user named `postgres`, with a password of `1safepwd` would take the form:

`localhost:5432:*:postgres:1safepwd`

The password file is usually named `~root/.pgpass` on Linux systems, or `%APPDATA%\postgresql\pgpass.conf` (on Windows). For more information about configuring a password file, visit the [PostgreSQL website](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html).

For more information about the authentication methods supported by Postgres, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/client-authentication.html).

## Editing the PEM server configuration

You can use the PEM client to graphically manage the configuration parameters of the PEM server to enable features or modify default settings. To open the `Server Configuration` dialog, select `Server Configuration…` from the `Management` menu.

![The Server Configuration dialog](/images/pem_server_config.png)

To modify a parameter value, edit the content displayed in the `Value` field to the right of a parameter name. Click the `Save` button to preserve your changes, or click the `Close` button to exit the dialog without applying the changes. Use the `Reset` button to return the parameters to their original value.

## Managing security

PEM provides a graphical way to manage your Postgres roles and servers.

### Login roles

When you connect to the PEM server, you must provide role credentials that allow access to the database on which the PEM server stores data. By default, the postgres superuser account is used to initially connect to the server, but it is strongly recommended (for both security and auditing purposes) that individual roles are created for each connecting user. You can use the PEM Query Tool, the PEM web interface `Create – Login/Group Role` dialog, or a command line client (such as psql) to create a role.

To use the `Create – Login/Group Role` dialog to create a role, expand the node for the server on which the role will reside in the PEM tree control, and right-click on the `Login/Group Roles` node to access the context menu. Then, select `Login/Group Role…` from the `Create` menu.

![The context menu of the Login Roles node](/images/pem_access_create_login.png)

Use fields on the tabs of the `Create – Login/Group` Role dialog to define the role. To display the PEM online help in a browser tab, click the help (`?`) button located in the lower-left corner of the dialog.

When you've finished defining the new role, click `Save` to create the role.

![Create Login Role - General tab](/images/role_general.png)

To modify the properties of an existing login role, right click on the name of a login role in the tree control, and select `Properties` from the context menu. To delete a login role, right click on the name of the role, and select `Delete/Drop` from the context menu.

For more complete information about creating and managing a role, see the [PostgreSQL online documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createrole.html).

### Group roles

Group roles can serve as containers, used to dispense system privileges (such as creating databases) and object privileges (e.g. inserting data into a particular table). The primary purpose of a group role is to make the mass management of system and object permissions much easier for a DBA. Rather than assigning or modifying privileges individually across many different login accounts, you can assign or change privileges for a single role and then grant that role to many login roles at once.

Use the `Group Roles` node (located beneath the name of each registered server in the PEM tree control) to create and manage group roles. Options on the context menu provide access to a dialog that allows you to create a new role or modify the properties of an existing role. You can find more information about creating roles [here](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createrole.html).

### Using PEM pre-defined roles to manage access to PEM functionality

You can use the `Login/Group Role` dialog to allow a role with limited privileges to access PEM features such as the Audit Manager, Capacity Manager, or SQL Profiler. PEM pre-defined roles allow access to PEM functionality; roles that are assigned membership in these roles can access the associated feature.

![Create Login Role - Membership tab](/images/role_membership.png)

When defining a user, use the `Membership` tab to specify the roles in which the new user is a member. The new user will share the privileges associated with each role in which it is a member. For a user to have access to PEM extended functionality, the role must be a member of the pem_user role and the pre-defined role that grants access to the feature. Use the `Roles` field to select pre-defined role names from a drop down list.

The `SQL` tab displays the SQL command that the server will execute when you click `Save`.

![Create Login Role - SQL tab](/images/role_sql.png)

The example shown above creates a login role named `acctg_clerk` that will have access to the `Audit Manager`; the role can make unlimited connections to the server at any given time.

You can use PEM pre-defined roles to allow access to the functionality listed in the table below:

| Value                            | Parent Role                  | Description                                                                                                                       |

### Using a team role

When you register a server for monitoring by PEM, you can specify a *Team* that will be associated with the server. A Team is a group role that can be used to allow or restrict access to one or more monitored servers to a limited group of role members. The PEM client will only display a server with a specified Team to those users who are:

-   a member of the Team role
-   the role that created the server
-   a role with superuser privileges on the PEM server.

To create a team role, expand the node for the server on which the role will reside in the PEM tree control, and right-click on the `Login/Group Roles` node to access the context menu. Then, select `Login/Group Role…` from the `Create` menu; when the `Create - Login/Group Role` dialog opens, use the fields provided to specify the properties of the team role.

### Object permissions

A role must be granted sufficient privileges before accessing, executing, or creating any database object. PEM allows you to assign (`GRANT`) and remove (`REVOKE`) object permissions to group roles or login accounts using the graphical interface of the PEM client.

Object permissions are managed via the graphical object editor for each particular object. For example, to assign privileges to access a database table, right click on the table name in the tree control, and select the Properties option from the context menu. Use the options displayed on the Privileges tab to assign privileges for the table.

The PEM client also contains a `Grant Wizard` (accessed through the `Tools` menu) that allows you to manage many object permissions at once.

## Server configuration parameters - reference

The following sections are provided for reference; please note that the items referred to in the following tables are subject to change.

You can use global configuration options to modify aspects of the PEM Server's behavior. Please note that the list of configuration parameters is subject to change.
