title: "Monitoring BDR Nodes"
---
!!! Note "New Feature: "
    BDR support is available in PEM 8.1.0 and later.
    
BDR (Bi-Directional Replication) is a PostgreSQL extension that provides a multi-master replication between the Postgres clusters. Before you monitor BDR through PEM console, you must ensure that your BDR nodes are up and running. For more information about BDR, please see [BDR Documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/bdr/latest).

You can configure PEM to display status information about one or more BDR Nodes via dashboards from PEM 8.1.0 and BDR 3.7.9 onwards.

To configure PEM to monitor `BDR Nodes`, use the PEM Web Client to create a server definition. Use the tabs on the [New Server Registration](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pem/latest/pem_online_help/01_toc_pem_getting_started/07_pem_define_connection/#pem_define_connection) dialog to specify general connection properties for the BDR Node with the following exceptions:

-   Specify the BDR-enabled database name in the `Database` field of the `PEM Agent` tab.

-   Specify the user having `bdr_monitor` or `bdr_superuser` role in the `username` field of the `PEM Agent` tab.

After saving the server definition, the BDR Node will be included in the list of servers under the PEM Server Directory in the PEM client object browser tree. You can monitor the `BDR Nodes` from BDR dashboards.

To include monitoring information on the BDR dashboards, you must enable the relative probes for each BDR Group. You can see the complete list of BDR Probes [here](05_performance_monitoring_and_management/#bdr-probes).

To enable a probe, right click on the node name, and select `Manage Probes` from the `Management` menu.

To monitor the BDR Node, right click on the name of the BDR Node in the Object browser tree control and navigate through the Dashboards menu to select `BDR Admin` or `BDR Group Monitoring` or `BDR Node Monitoring` dashboard.
