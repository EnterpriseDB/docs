title: "The ERD Tool"
---
!!! Note "New Feature: "
    The ERD Tool is available in PEM 8.1.0 and later.

The **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)** tool is a database design tool that provides a graphical representation of database tables, columns, and inter-relationships. ERD can give sufficient information for the database administrator to follow when developing and maintaining the database. You can access the ERD Tool via the `ERD Tool` menu option on the `Tools` menu. The ERD Tool allows you to:

-   Design and visualize the database tables and their relationships.
-   Add notes to the diagram.
-   Auto-align the tables and links for cleaner visualization.
-   Save the diagram and open it later to continue working on it.
-   Generate ready to run SQL from the database design.
-   Generate the database diagram for an existing database.
