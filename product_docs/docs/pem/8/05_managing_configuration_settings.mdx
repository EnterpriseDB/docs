Multiple configuration files are read at startup by Postgres Enterprise Manager. The files are as follows:

-   `config.py`: This is the main configuration file, and should not be modified. It can be used as a reference for configuration settings, that may be overridden in one of the following files.
-   `config_distro.py`: This file is read after `config.py` and is intended for packagers to change any settings that are required for their Postgres Enterprise Manager distribution. This may typically include certain paths and file locations. This file is optional, and may be created by packagers in the same directory as `config.py` if needed.
-   `config_local.py`: This file is read after `config_distro.py` and is intended for end users to change any default or packaging specific settings that they may wish to adjust to meet local preferences or standards.This file is optional, and may be created by users in the same directory as `config.py` if needed.

A copy of the default `config.py` file is included in the PEM online help for reference.
