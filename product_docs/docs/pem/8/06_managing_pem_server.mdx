The sections that follow provide information about tasks related to PEM server such as restarting the PEM server and agent, controlling the PEM server or PEM agent, controlling the HTTPD service on Linux and Windows, controlling the HTTPD server, managing PEM authentication and security, modifying the `pg_hba.conf` file, modifying PEM to use a proxy server etc.

## Starting and stopping the PEM server and agents

The PEM server starts, stops and restarts when the Postgres server instance on which it resides starts, stops or restarts; use the same commands to control the PEM server that you would use to control the Postgres server. On Linux platforms, the command that stops and starts the service script will vary by platform and OS version.

The PEM agent is controlled by a service named `pemagent`.

The Windows operating system includes a graphical service controller that displays the server status, and offers point-and-click server control. The `Services` utility can be accessed through the Windows `Control Panel`. When the utility opens, use the scroll bar to navigate through the listed services to highlight the service name.

![The PEM service in the Windows Services window](../images/pem_services_windows_server_agent.png)

Use the `Stop`, `Pause`, `Start`, or `Restart` buttons to control the state of the service.

Please note that any user (or client application) connected to the Postgres server will be abruptly disconnected if you stop the service. For more information about controlling a service, please consult the [*EDB Postgres Advanced Server Installation Guide*](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/), available from the EDB website.

## Remotely starting and stopping monitored servers

PEM allows you to startup and shutdown managed server instances with the PEM client. To configure a server to allow PEM to manage the service, complete the Server registration dialog, registering the database server with a PEM agent and:

-   specify the `Store on PEM Server` option on the `Properties` dialog.

-   specify the name of a service script in the `Service ID` field on the `Advanced` tab:

    -   For Advanced Server, the service name is `edb-as-<x>` or `ppas-<x>`.
    -   For PostgreSQL, the service name is `postgresql-<x>`.

    Where `x` indicates the server version number.

After connecting to the server, you can start or stop the server by highlighting the server name in the tree control, and selecting `Queue Server Startup` or `Queue Server Shutdown` from the `Tools` menu.

![The Tools menu of a managed server](../images/pem_server_tools_menu_queue_server.png)

## Controlling the PEM server or PEM agent on Linux

On Linux platforms, the name of the service script that controls:

-   a PEM server on Advanced Server is `edb-as-<x>` or `ppas-<x>`
-   a PEM server on PostgreSQL is `postgresql-<x>`
-   a PEM agent is `pemagent`

Where `x` indicates the server version number.

You can use the service script to control the service.

-   To control a service on RHEL or CentOS version 7.x or 8.x open a command line, assume superuser privileges, and issue the command:

    ```text
    systemctl <service_name> <action>
    ```

Where:

`service_name` is the name of the service.

`action` specifies the action taken by the service. Specify:

-   `start` to start the service.
-   `stop` to stop the service.
-   `restart` to stop and then start the service.
-   `status` to check the status of the service.

## Controlling the PEM server or PEM agent on Windows

The Windows operating system includes a graphical service controller that displays the server status, and offers point-and-click server control. The registered name of the service that controls:

-   a PEM server host on PostgreSQL is `postgresql-<x>`
-   a PEM server host on Advanced Server is `edb-as-<x>`, or `ppas-<x>`
-   a PEM agent is `Postgres Enterprise Manager - pemAgent`

Where `x` indicates the server version number.

Navigate through the Windows `Control Panel` to open the `Services` utility. When the utility opens, use the scroll bar to browse the list of services.

![The Windows Services window](../images/pem_services_windows_server_agent.png)

Use the `Stop the service` option to stop a service. Any user (or client application) connected to the server will be abruptly disconnected if you stop the service.

Use the `Pause the service` option to instruct Postgres to reload a service's configuration parameters. The `Pause the service` option is an effective way to reset parameters without disrupting user sessions for many of the configuration parameters.

Use the `Start the service` option to start a service.

## Controlling the HTTPD server

On Linux, you can confirm the status of the `PEM-HTTPD` service by opening a command line, and entering the following command:

```text
ps -ef | grep httpd
```

If Linux responds with an answer that is similar to the following example, `httpd` is not running:

```text
user 13321 13267 0 07:37 pts/1 00:00:00 grep httpd
```

To start the service on a CentOS or RHEL 7.x or 8.x system, use the command:

```text
systemctl start httpd
```

On Windows, you can use the `Services` applet to check the status of the `PEM HTTPD` service. After opening the Services applet, scroll through the list to locate the `PEM HTTPD` service.

![The PEM HTTPD Windows service](../images/pem_services_httpd.png)

The `Status` column displays the current state of the server. Click the `Start` link to start `PEM HTTPD` if the service is not running.

## Modifying the pg_hba.conf file

Entries in the `pg_hba.conf` file control network authentication and authorization. The `pg_hba.conf` file on the PEM server host must allow connections between the PEM server and PEM-HTTPD, the PEM agent, and the monitored servers.

During the PEM server installation process, you are prompted for the IP address and connection information for hosts that will be monitored by PEM; this information is added to the top of the `pg_hba.conf` file of the PEM backing database.

![PEM entries in the pg_hba.conf file](../images/pem_pg_hba.png)

You may also need to manually modify the `pg_hba.conf` file to allow connections between the PEM server and other components. For example, if your PEM-HTTPD installation does not reside on the same host as the PEM server, you must modify the `pg_hba.conf` file on the PEM server host to allow PEM-HTTPD to connect to the server.

By default, the `pg_hba.conf` file resides in the data directory, under your Postgres installation; for example, on an Advanced Server 10 host, the default location of the pg_hba.conf is:

`/var/lib/edb/as10/data/pg_hba.conf`

You can modify the `pg_hba.conf` file with your editor of choice. After modifying the file, restart the server for changes to take effect.

The following example shows a `pg_hba.conf` entry that allows an md5 password authenticated connection from a user named `postgres`, to the `postgres` database on the host on which the pg_hba.conf file resides. The connection is coming from an IP address of `192.168.10.102`:

```text
# TYPE     DATABASE        USER        CIDR-ADDRESS         METHOD
# IPv4 local connections:
 host     postgres       postgres    192.168.10.102/32       md5
```

You may specify the address of a network host, or a network address range. For example, if you wish to allow connections from servers with the addresses `192.168.10.23`, `192.168.10.76` and `192.168.10.184`, enter a CIDR-ADDRESS of `192.168.10.0/24` to allow connections from all of the hosts in that network:

```text
# TYPE     DATABASE        USER        CIDR-ADDRESS       METHOD
# IPv4 local connections:
  host      postgres         all       192.168.10.0/24       md5
```

For more information about formatting a `pg_hba.conf` file entry, please see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

Before you can connect to a Postgres server with PEM, you must ensure that the `pg_hba.conf` file on both servers allows the connection.

If you receive this error when connecting to the database server, modify the `pg_hba.conf` file, adding an entry that allows the connection.

## Creating and maintaining databases and objects

Each instance of a Postgres server manages one or more databases; each user must provide authentication information to connect to the database before accessing the information contained within it. The PEM client provides dialogs that allow you to create and manage databases, and all of the various objects that comprise a database (e.g. tables, indexes, stored procedures, etc.).

Creating a database is easy in PEM: simply right click on any managed server’s `Databases` node and select `Database…` from the `Create` menu. After defining a database, you can create objects within the new database.

For example, to create a new table, right click on a `Tables` node, and select `Table…` from the `Create` menu. When the `New Table` dialog opens, specify the attributes of the new table.

![Create Table - General Tab](../images/table_general.png)

PEM provides similar dialogs for the creation and management of other database objects:

-   tables
-   indexes
-   stored procedures
-   functions
-   triggers
-   views
-   constraints, etc.

Each object type is displayed in the tree control; right click on the node that corresponds to an object type to access the `Create` menu and create a new object, or select `Properties` from the context menu of a named node to perform administrative tasks for the highlighted object.

## Managing PEM authentication

Postgres supports a number of authentication methods:

-   Secure password (md5)
-   GSSAPI
-   SSPI
-   Kerberos
-   Ident
-   LDAP
-   RADIUS
-   Certificate (SSL)
-   PAM

Postgres (and PEM) authentication is controlled by the `pg_hba.conf` configuration file. Entries within the configuration file specify who may connect to a specific database, and the type of authentication required before that user is allowed to connect.

A typical entry in the `pg_hba.conf` file that allows a user named `postgres` to connect to all databases from the local host (127.0.0.1/32) using secure password (md5) authentication connections would take the form:

`host all postgres 127.0.0.1/32 md5`

Depending on your system's configuration, you may also need to create a password file for the user account that the PEM agent uses to connect to the server, to allow the agent to properly respond to the server’s authentication request. An entry in the password file for a user named `postgres`, with a password of `1safepwd` would take the form:

`localhost:5432:*:postgres:1safepwd`

The password file is usually named `~root/.pgpass` on Linux systems, or `%APPDATA%\postgresql\pgpass.conf` (on Windows). For more information about configuring a password file, visit the [PostgreSQL website](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html).

For more information about the authentication methods supported by Postgres, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/client-authentication.html).

## Editing the PEM server configuration

You can use the PEM client to graphically manage the configuration parameters of the PEM server to enable features or modify default settings. To open the `Server Configuration` dialog, select `Server Configuration…` from the `Management` menu.

![The Server Configuration dialog](../images/pem_server_config.png)

To modify a parameter value, edit the content displayed in the `Value` field to the right of a parameter name. Click the `Save` button to preserve your changes, or click the `Close` button to exit the dialog without applying the changes. Use the `Reset` button to return the parameters to their original value.

## Managing security

PEM provides a graphical way to manage your Postgres roles and servers.

### Login roles

When you connect to the PEM server, you must provide role credentials that allow access to the database on which the PEM server stores data. By default, the postgres superuser account is used to initially connect to the server, but it is strongly recommended (for both security and auditing purposes) that individual roles are created for each connecting user. You can use the PEM Query Tool, the PEM web interface `Create – Login/Group Role` dialog, or a command line client (such as psql) to create a role.

To use the `Create – Login/Group Role` dialog to create a role, expand the node for the server on which the role will reside in the PEM tree control, and right-click on the `Login/Group Roles` node to access the context menu. Then, select `Login/Group Role…` from the `Create` menu.

![The context menu of the Login Roles node](../images/pem_access_create_login.png)

Use fields on the tabs of the `Create – Login/Group` Role dialog to define the role. To display the PEM online help in a browser tab, click the help (`?`) button located in the lower-left corner of the dialog.

When you've finished defining the new role, click `Save` to create the role.

![Create Login Role - General tab](../images/role_general.png)

To modify the properties of an existing login role, right click on the name of a login role in the tree control, and select `Properties` from the context menu. To delete a login role, right click on the name of the role, and select `Delete/Drop` from the context menu.

For more complete information about creating and managing a role, see the [PostgreSQL online documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createrole.html).

### Group roles

Group roles can serve as containers, used to dispense system privileges (such as creating databases) and object privileges (e.g. inserting data into a particular table). The primary purpose of a group role is to make the mass management of system and object permissions much easier for a DBA. Rather than assigning or modifying privileges individually across many different login accounts, you can assign or change privileges for a single role and then grant that role to many login roles at once.

Use the `Group Roles` node (located beneath the name of each registered server in the PEM tree control) to create and manage group roles. Options on the context menu provide access to a dialog that allows you to create a new role or modify the properties of an existing role. You can find more information about creating roles [here](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createrole.html).

### Using PEM pre-defined roles to manage access to PEM functionality

You can use the `Login/Group Role` dialog to allow a role with limited privileges to access PEM features such as the Audit Manager, Capacity Manager, or SQL Profiler. PEM pre-defined roles allow access to PEM functionality; roles that are assigned membership in these roles can access the associated feature.

![Create Login Role - Membership tab](../images/role_membership.png)

When defining a user, use the `Membership` tab to specify the roles in which the new user is a member. The new user will share the privileges associated with each role in which it is a member. For a user to have access to PEM extended functionality, the role must be a member of the pem_user role and the pre-defined role that grants access to the feature. Use the `Roles` field to select pre-defined role names from a drop down list.

The `SQL` tab displays the SQL command that the server will execute when you click `Save`.

![Create Login Role - SQL tab](../images/role_sql.png)

The example shown above creates a login role named `acctg_clerk` that will have access to the `Audit Manager`; the role can make unlimited connections to the server at any given time.

You can use PEM pre-defined roles to allow access to the functionality listed in the table below:

| Value                            | Parent Role                  | Description                                                                                                                       |

### Using a team role

When you register a server for monitoring by PEM, you can specify a *Team* that will be associated with the server. A Team is a group role that can be used to allow or restrict access to one or more monitored servers to a limited group of role members. The PEM client will only display a server with a specified Team to those users who are:

-   a member of the Team role
-   the role that created the server
-   a role with superuser privileges on the PEM server.

To create a team role, expand the node for the server on which the role will reside in the PEM tree control, and right-click on the `Login/Group Roles` node to access the context menu. Then, select `Login/Group Role…` from the `Create` menu; when the `Create - Login/Group Role` dialog opens, use the fields provided to specify the properties of the team role.

### Object permissions

A role must be granted sufficient privileges before accessing, executing, or creating any database object. PEM allows you to assign (`GRANT`) and remove (`REVOKE`) object permissions to group roles or login accounts using the graphical interface of the PEM client.

Object permissions are managed via the graphical object editor for each particular object. For example, to assign privileges to access a database table, right click on the table name in the tree control, and select the Properties option from the context menu. Use the options displayed on the Privileges tab to assign privileges for the table.

The PEM client also contains a `Grant Wizard` (accessed through the `Tools` menu) that allows you to manage many object permissions at once.

## Managing job notifications

You can configure the settings in PEM console for sending the SMTP trap on success or failure of a system-generated job (listed under scheduled tasks) or a custom-defined agent job. These email notification settings can be configured at following three levels (in order of precedence) to send email notifications to the specified user group:

-   Job level
-   Agent level
-   PEM server level (default level)

### Configuring job notifications at job level

You can configure email notification settings at job level only for a custom-defined agent job in one of the following ways:

-   For a new agent job, you can configure the email notification settings in the `Notification` tab of `Create-Agent Job` wizard while creating the job itself.
-   For an existing custom-defined job, you can edit the properties of the job and configure the notification settings.

![Configure Job Notification - Job level](../images/job_notifications_job_level.png)

Use the fields on the `Notifications` tab to configure the email notification settings on job level:

-   Use the `Send the notifications` field to specify when you want the email notifications to be sent.
-   Use the `Email group` field to specify the email group that should receive the email notification.

### Configuring job notifications at agent level

Select the agent in the tree view, right click and select *Properties*. In the `Properties` dialog, select the *Job notifications* tab.

![Configure Job Notification - Agent level](../images/job_notifications_agent_level.png)

Use the fields on the Job notifications tab to configure the email notification settings on agent level:

-   Use the `Override default configuration?` switch to specify if you want the agent level job notification settings to override the default job notification settings. If you select *Yes* for this switch, you can use the rest of the settings on this dialog to define when and to whom the job notifications should be sent. Please note that the rest of the settings on this dialog work only if you enable the `Override default configuration?` switch.
-   Use the `Email on job completion?` switch to specify if the job notification should be sent on the successful job completion.
-   Use the `Email on a job failure?` switch to specify if the job notification should be sent on the failure of a job.
-   Use the `Email group` field to specify the email group to whom the job notification should be sent.

### Configuring job notifications at server level

You can use the *Server Configuration* dialog to provide information about your email notification configuration at PEM server level. To open the Server Configuration dialog, select *Server Configuration...* from the PEM client's Management menu.

![Configure Job Notification - Server level](../images/job_notifications_server_level.png)

Four server configuration parameters specify information about your job notification preferences at PEM server level:

-   Use the `job_failure_notification` switch to specify if you want to send email notification after each job failure.
-   Use the `job_notification_email_group` parameter to specify the email group that should receive the email notification.
-   Use the `job_retention_time parameter` to specify the number of days that non-recurring scheduled tasks should be retained in the system.
-   Use the `job_status_change_notification` switch to specify if you want to send email notification after each job status change, irrespective of its status being a failure, success, or interrupted.

## Managing PEM scheduled jobs

You can create a PEM scheduled job to perform a set of custom-defined steps in the specified sequence. These steps may contain SQL code or a batch/shell script that you may run on a server that is bound with the agent. You can schedule these jobs to suit your business requirements. For example, you can create a job for taking a backup of a particular database server and schedule it to run on a specific date and time of every month.

To create or manage a PEM scheduled job, use the PEM tree control to browse to the PEM agent for which you want to create the job. The tree control will display a Jobs node, under which currently defined jobs are displayed. To add a new job, right click on the `Jobs` node, and select `Create Job...` from the context menu.

When the `Create - Agent Job` dialog opens, use the tabs on the `Create - Agent Job` dialog to define the steps and schedule that make up a PEM scheduled job.

![Create Agent Job - General tab](../images/create_pem_jobs_general.png)

Use the fields on the `General` tab to provide general information about a job:

-   Provide a name for the job in the `Name` field.
-   Move the `Enabled` switch to the `Yes` position to enable a job, or `No` to disable a job.
-   Use the `Comment` field to store notes about the job.

![Create Agent Job - Steps tab](../images/create_pem_jobs_steps.png)

Use the `Steps` tab to define and manage the steps that the job will perform. Click the `Add` icon (+) to add a new step; then click the compose icon (located at the left side of the header) to open the step definition dialog:

![Create Agent Job - Steps tab - General tab](../images/create_pem_jobs_steps_definition.png)

Use fields on the step definition dialog to define the step:

-   Provide a name for the step in the `Name` field; please note that steps will be performed in alphanumeric order by name.

-   Use the `Enabled` switch to include the step when executing the job (`True`) or to disable the step (`False`).

-   Use the `Kind` switch to indicate if the job step invokes SQL code (`SQL`) or a batch script (`Batch`).

    -   If you select `SQL`, use the `Code` tab to provide SQL code for the step.
    -   If you select `Batch`, use the `Code` tab to provide the batch script that will be executed during the step.

-   Use the `On error` drop-down to specify the behavior of pgAgent if it encounters an error while executing the step. Select from:

    -   Fail - Stop the job if you encounter an error while processing this step.
    -   Success - Mark the step as completing successfully, and continue.
    -   Ignore - Ignore the error, and continue.

-   If you have selected SQL as your input for `Kind` switch, provide the following additional information:

    -   Use the `Server` field to specify the server that is bound with the agent for which you are creating the PEM scheduled job.
    -   Use the `Database` field to specify the database that is associated with the server that you have selected.

-   Use the `Comment` field to provide a comment about the step.

![Create Agent Job - Steps tab - Code tab](../images/create_pem_jobs_steps_definition_code.png)

-   Use the context-sensitive field on the step definition dialog's `Code` tab to provide the SQL code or batch script that will be executed during the step:

    -   If the step invokes SQL code, provide one or more SQL statements in the `SQL query` field.

    -   If the step invokes a batch script, provide the script in the `Code` field. If you are running on a Windows server, standard batch file syntax must be used. When running on a Linux server, any shell script may be used, provided that a suitable interpreter is specified on the first line (e.g. *#!/bin/sh*). Along with the defined inline code, you can also provide the path of any batch script, shell script, or SQL file on the filesystem.

        -   To invoke a script on a Linux system, you must modify the entry for `batch_script_user` parameter in the `agent.cfg` file and specify the user that should be used to run the script. You can either specify a non-root user or root for this parameter. If you do not specify a user, or the specified user does not exist, then the script will not be executed. Restart the agent after modifying the file.

        -   To invoke a script on a Windows system, set the registry entry for `AllowBatchJobSteps` to `true` and restart the PEM agent. PEM registry entries are located in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\EnterpriseDB\PEM\agent`.

After providing all the information required by the step, click the `Save` button to save and close the step definition dialog.

Click the add icon (+) to add each additional step, or select the `Schedules` tab to define the job schedule.

Click the add icon (+) to add a schedule for the job; then click the compose icon (located at the left side of the header) to open the schedule definition dialog:

![Create Agent Job - Schedules tab - General tab](../images/create_pem_jobs_schedules.png)

Use the fields on the `Schedules definition` tab to specify the days and times at which the job will execute.

-   Provide a name for the schedule in the `Name` field.
-   Use the `Enabled` switch to indicate that pgAgent should use the schedule (`Yes`) or to disable the schedule (`No`).
-   Use the calendar selector in the `Start` field to specify the starting date and time for the schedule.
-   Use the calendar selector in the `End` field to specify the ending date and time for the schedule.
-   Use the `Comment` field to provide a comment about the schedule.

Select the `Repeat` tab to define the days on which the schedule will execute.

![Create Agent Job - Schedules tab - Repeat tab](../images/create_pem_jobs_schedules_repeat.png)

Use the fields on the `Repeat` tab to specify the details about the schedule in a cron-style format. The job will execute on each date or time element selected on the `Repeat` tab.

Click within a field to open a list of valid values for that field; click on a specific value to add that value to the list of selected values for the field. To clear the values from a field, click the X located at the right-side of the field.

-   Use the fields within the `Days` box to specify the days on which the job will execute:
    -   Use the `Week Days` field to select the days on which the job will execute.
    -   Use the `Month Days` field to select the numeric days on which the job will execute. Specify the `Last Day` to indicate that the job should be performed on the last day of the month, irregardless of the date.
    -   Use the `Months` field to select the months in which the job will execute.
-   Use the fields within the `Times` box to specify the times at which the job will execute:
    -   Use the `Hours` field to select the hour at which the job will execute.
    -   Use the `Minutes` field to select the minute at which the job will execute.

Select the `Exceptions` tab to specify any days on which the schedule will `not` execute.

![Create Agent Job - Schedules tab - Exceptions tab](../images/create_pem_jobs_schedules_exceptions.png)

Use the fields on the `Exceptions` tab to specify days on which you wish the job to not execute; for example, you may wish for jobs to not execute on national holidays.

Click the Add icon (+) to add a row to the exception table, then:

-   Click within the `Date` column to open a calendar selector, and select a date on which the job will not execute. Specify `<Any>` in the `Date` column to indicate that the job should not execute on any day at the time selected.
-   Click within the `Time` column to open a time selector, and specify a time on which the job will not execute. Specify `<Any>` in the `Time` column to indicate that the job should not execute at any time on the day selected.

Select the `Notifications` tab to configure the email notification settings on job level:

![Create Agent Job - Notifications tab](../images/create_pem_jobs_notifications.png)

Use the fields on the `Notifications` tab to configure the email notification settings for a job:

-   Use the `Send the notifications` field to specify when you want the email notifications to be sent.
-   Use the `Email group` field to specify the email group that should receive the email notification.

When you've finished defining the schedule, you can use the `SQL` tab to review the code that will create or modify your job.

![Create Agent Job - SQL tab](../images/create_pem_jobs_sql.png)

Click the `Save` button to save the job definition, or `Cancel` to exit the job without saving. Use the `Reset` button to remove your unsaved entries from the dialog.

After saving a job, the job will be listed under the `Jobs` node of the PEM tree control of the server on which it was defined. The `Properties` tab in the PEM console will display a high-level overview of the selected job, and the Statistics tab will show the details of each run of the job. To modify an existing job or to review detailed information about a job, right-click on a job name, and select `Properties` from the context menu.
