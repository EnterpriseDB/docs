This document provides detailed information about using pgBouncer as a connection pooler for limiting the number of connections from the PEM Agent towards the Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) server on non-Windows machine:

-   Preparing the PEM Database Server – provides information about preparing the PEM database server to be used with pgBouncer.
-   Configuring pgBouncer – provides detailed information about configuring pgBouncer to make it work with the PEM database server.
-   Configuring the PEM Agent – provides detailed information about configuring a PEM Agent to connect to pgBouncer.

For detailed information about using the PEM web interface, please see the [PEM Administrator's Guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pem/latest/pem_admin/).

This document uses the term `Postgres` to mean either the PostgreSQL or the Advanced Server database.
