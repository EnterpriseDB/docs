1.  Install a backend database.

    When installing a PEM server on a Linux host, you must first install a backend database cluster which will hold the `pem` database. The PEM server’s backend database may be installed via package for Linux. The backend database must be one of the following versions:

    -   EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 11 or above

    -   PostgreSQL version 11 or above

    For detailed information about installing an Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database, please see the product documentation at the EDB website.

2.  Configure Postgres authentication on the backend database.

    The `pg_hba.conf` file on the backend database can be configured to use any supported authentication methods (for example: md5, trust,...) for connections. For information about modifying the `pg_hba.conf` file, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

3.  If you are using a PostgreSQL database, use the following command to install the `hstore contrib module`:

    ```text
    yum install postgresql<x>-contrib
    ```

    Where, `x` is the server version.

4.  Ensure that the `sslutils` extension is installed.

    -   On an Advanced Server backend database, the `sslutils` extension is installed by default.

    -   If you are using a PostgreSQL backend database, ensure you have access to the PostgreSQL community repository, and use the command:

    ```text
    yum install sslutils_<x>     
    ```

    Where, `x` is the server version.

    Please note that Debian 10 and Ubuntu 20 has increased the requirements to accept the certificates due to security reason. If a user wants to install the PEM Agent on any of the machines, they must upgrade `ssltuils` to 1.3 where 4096 bit RSA key and sha256 signature algorithm support has added.If the user does not upgrade `sslutils` to 1.3, then PEM Agent may fail to connect to the PEM backend database server, and it might log the error `ca md too weak`.
     


5.  Adjust your firewall restrictions.

    If you are using a firewall, you must allow access to port `8443` on the PEM backend database:

    ```text
    firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8443/tcp
     
    firewall-cmd --reload
    ```

6.  Request credentials that allow you to access the EDB repositories:
    To install the PEM Server, you must have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, contact [EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request) . When using commands in the sections that follow, replace the `username` and `password` placeholders with the credentials provided by EDB
     


7.  PEM is dependent on third-party components from the vendor repository, including the python3, libboost, openssl, snmp++, libcurl, etc. To ensure these components are up to date, you should update your operating system using following platform-specific commands. Minimum version require for openssl is 1.0.2k.

    To upgrade packages on a CentOS or RHEL 7.x host

    ```text
    yum upgrade
    ```

    To upgrade packages on a CentOS or RHEL 8.x host

    ```text
    dnf upgrade
    ```

    To upgrade packages on a Debian or Ubuntu host

    ```text
    apt-get update
    ```

    To upgrade packages on a SLES host

    ```text
    zypper update
    ```
