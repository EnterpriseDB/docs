Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) is designed to assist database administrators, system architects, and performance analysts when administering, monitoring, and tuning PostgreSQL and Advanced Server database servers. PEM has been designed to manage and monitor a single server or multiple servers from a single console, allowing complete control over monitored databases.

This document provides step-by-step instructions to guide you through the installation of Postgres Enterprise Manager on a Linux host.

Throughout this guide, the term `Postgres` refers to either a PostgreSQL or an EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended (formerly known as 2ndQPostgres) installation, where either is appropriate.
