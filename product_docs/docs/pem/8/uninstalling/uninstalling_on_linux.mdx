The process of uninstalling the PEM server or Agent is platform-specific. The name of the package for PEM server is `edb-pem-server` and for PEM Agent is `edb-pem-agent`.

If you uninstall the PEM server package from a host, the PEM Agent package installed on the same host doesn't get uninstalled. But if you uninstall the PEM Agent package, then the PEM server package installed on the same host also gets uninstalled.

!!! Note
    Before uninstalling the PEM Agent, you need to de-register the agent first. You can de-register the agent using the `pemworker` command-line utility. After that, you can proceed with the uninstallation steps.

## Uninstalling PEM components from CentOS or RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux hosts

You can use variations of the `rpm`, `yum remove`, or `yum erase` commands to remove the installed packages from CentOS/RHEL 7.x or Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux/RHEL 8.x hosts. Also, you can use the `dnf remove` command to remove the installed package from Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux/RHEL 8.x hosts. Note that removing a package does not damage the PEM data directory.

-   Include the `-e` option when invoking the rpm command to remove an installed package; the command syntax is:

    ```text
    rpm -e package_name
    ```

-   You can use the `yum remove` command to remove the PEM Server or Agent package installed by yum. To remove a package, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter the command:

    ```text
    yum remove package_name
    ```

-   You can use the `yum erase` command to remove the pem server or Agent package along with the `edb-pem` and `edb-pem-docs` dependencies. To remove a package, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter the command:

    ```text
    yum erase package_name
    ```

Where `package_name` is the name of the package that you would like to remove.

-   You can use `dnf remove` command to remove the pem server or Agent along with the `edb-pem` and `edb-pem-docs` dependencies on Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux or RHEL 8.x hosts. To remove a package, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter the command:

    ```text
    dnf remove package_name
    ```

## Uninstalling PEM components from Debian or Ubuntu hosts

You can use `apt-get remove` or `apt-get purge` command to uninstall the PEM server or Agent package from a Debian or Ubuntu host:

-   To uninstall PEM server or Agent from a Debian or Ubuntu host without impacting the configuration files and data directories, invoke the following command:

    ```text
    apt-get remove package_name
    ```

-   To uninstall PEM server or Agent along with the configuration files and data directory, invoke the following command:

    ```text
    apt-get purge package_name
    ```

Where `package_name` is the name of the package that you would like to remove.

## Uninstalling PEM components from SLES hosts

To uninstall PEM server or Agent from a SLES host, invoke the following command:

```text
zypper remove package_name
```

Where `package_name` is the name of the package that you would like to remove.
