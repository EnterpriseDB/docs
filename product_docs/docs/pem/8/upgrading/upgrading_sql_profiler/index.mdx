The process of upgrading SQL Profiler is platform specific. You can update SQL Profiler on a Linux platform by using the native packages and on a Windows platform by using the graphical installer available for Windows. 

!!! Note
    - Prior to PEM version 7.8 release, you can install SQL Profiler on Linux either by using the     
      graphical installer or by using the RPMs. 
    - From PEM version 7.8 and later, SQL Profiler graphical installers for Linux are discontinued. To upgrade a SQL Profiler on a Linux host from any earlier version to PEM 7.9 or later versions, you must use native packages.

Links to SQL Profiler installers and RPMs are available at the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/edb-postgres-enterprise-manager).
