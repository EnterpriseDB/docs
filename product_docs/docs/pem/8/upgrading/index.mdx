You can upgrade the Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) components including the PEM installation, the backend database, and the SQL Profiler. You can also move the PEM server.

!!! Note
    If you're upgrading PEM 7.x to the latest version and the PEM backend database is PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 10 or earlier:
    1.  Upgrade the PEM backend database.
    2.  Upgrade the PEM installation.

    If the PEM backend database is PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Sever version 11 or later, then upgrading the PEM backend database is optional.
