A PEM Agent may monitor one or more servers on one or more hosts. For comprehensive information about managing a PEM Agent, see the [PEM Agent User Guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pem/latest/pem_agent/).

On a Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux system, you can use the `dnf` command to install a PEM Agent; the installation tool you use will be dependent on the version of the host operating system. Before installing the agent, you must ensure that your system contains the required prerequisite software listed below.

**Install the `epel-release` package**

```text
dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
```

**Enable the powertools repository since EPEL packages may depend on packages from it**

```text
dnf config-manager --set-enabled powertools
```

**Install and Configure the edb.repo File**

To create an EDB repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

```text
dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`. After creating the `edb.repo` file, use the following command to replace the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the &lt;username> and &lt;password> of a registered EDB user:

```text
sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
```

To request credentials for the repository, contact [EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

**Installing the PEM Agent**

-   Install the PEM Agent package:

    ```text
    dnf install edb-pem-agent
    ```

When the installation is complete, you can review a list of the installed packages and dependencies.

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

After installing PEM Agent using `dnf`, you need to register the PEM Agent. For detailed information see [Registering a PEM Agent](09_registering_a_pem_agent/#registering-a-pem-agent).
