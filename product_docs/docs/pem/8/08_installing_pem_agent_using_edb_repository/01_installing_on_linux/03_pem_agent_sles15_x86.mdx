There are two steps to completing an installation:

- [Setting up the repository](#setting-up-the-repository)
- [Installing the package](#installing-the-package)

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser
sudo su -
```

Before setting up the repository, you need to register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

## Setting up the Repository

```shell
# Install the repository configuration and enter your EDB repository
# credentials when prompted
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
zypper install SUSEConnect

# Register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
# You can skip this step if already registered
# Replace 'REGISTRATION_CODE' and 'EMAIL' with your SUSE registration information
SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'

# Activate the required SUSE modules on SUSE 15
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.3/x86_64

# Install the following repository for PEM dependencies
zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache:/Modules/SLE_15_SP3/Apache:Modules.repo

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh
```

## Installing the Package

```shell
zypper -n install edb-pem-agent
```

After installing the PEM Agent, you must register the agent. For more detailed information see [Registering a PEM Agent](09_registering_a_pem_agent/#registering-a-pem-agent).
