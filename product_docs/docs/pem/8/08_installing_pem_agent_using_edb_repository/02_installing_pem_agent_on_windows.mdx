To invoke the PEM Agent installer, assume `Administrative` privileges and navigate into the directory that contains the installer. Then, invoke the installer with the command:

```text
pem_agent-7.<x>.<x>-<x>-platform.exe
```

The `Setup…` page opens, welcoming you to the PEM Agent installer.

![PEM Agent Wizard - Welcome dialog](../../images/pem_agent_welcome_dialog.png)

Click `Next` to continue to the `License Agreement`.

![PEM Agent Wizard - License Agreement dialog](../../images/pem_agent_windows_license_agreement.png)

Carefully review the license agreement before highlighting the appropriate radio button and accepting the agreement; click `Next` to continue to the `Installation Directory` dialog.

![PEM Agent Wizard - Installation Directory dialog](../../images/pem_agent_windows_installation_directory.png)

By default, the PEM Agent is installed in the `C:\Program Files (x86)\edb\pem` directory.You can accept the default installation directory, or modify the contents of the `Installation Directory` field, specifying an alternate installation directory for the PEM agent.

By default, the PEM Agent installer places a certificate in the Administrator’s `%APPDATA%\pem` directory. Check the `Show advanced options` box to indicate that you would like the PEM agent installer to include a dialog that allows you to specify an alternate path for the certificate file.

Check the box next to `Register now?` to instruct the installer to register the newly installed PEM Agent with the PEM server.

Click `Next` to continue to the `PEM Server Installation Details` dialog.

![PEM Agent Wizard - PEM Server Installation details dialog](../../images/pem_agent_pem_server_windows_installation_details.png)

Enter the connection details for the PEM server on the `PEM server installation details` dialog:

-   Specify the name or IP address of the system on which the PEM database server resides in the `Host` field. Please note: If the PEM-HTTPD web server and PEM database are hosted on different systems, you must specify *the host of the PEM database*.
-   Specify the name of the database superuser in the `User Name` field.
-   Specify the password associated with the database superuser in the `Password` field.
-   Specify the port that PostgreSQL is monitoring in the `Port` field.

Click `Next` to continue to `pemAgent Service Account`. The installer will attempt to connect to the server to verify that the details are correct.

!!! Note
    The PEM server must allow connections from the PEM Agent installer. If you encounter a connection error, confirm the connection properties specified on the `PEM Server Installation Details` dialog are correct, and confirm that the `pg_hba.conf` file (on the PEM server) will allow a connection to the server described in the error message.

![PEM Agent Wizard - pemAgent Service Account password dialog](../../images/pem_agent_service_account_windows_password.png)

Provide the password for the edb account under which the pemAgent service will run. The Agent certificate and key files will be created in `C:\Users\edb\AppData\Roaming\pem` directory. Click `Next` to continue to `Agent Details` dialog.

![PEM Agent Wizard - Naming PEM Agent dialog](../../images/pem_agent_windows_agent_details.png)

The tree control displayed in the `Browser` panel of the PEM web interface displays the value entered in the `Description` field to identify the PEM agent. Specify a descriptive name for the agent, such as the hostname of the machine the agent is installed on, or a name that reflects the host's functionality.

Provide a descriptive name, or accept the default provided by the PEM Agent host, and click `Next` to continue.

If you checked the `Show advanced options` checkbox, the `Advanced options` dialog opens.

![PEM Agent Wizard - Advanced Options - Certificate Path dialog](../../images/pem_agent_windows_advanced_options_certificate_path.png)

By default, the PEM Agent installer places the certificate in the `C:\Program Files (x86)\edb\pem` directory. Specify an alternate path for the certificate or accept the default and click `Next`.

The wizard is now ready to install the PEM Agent; click `Back` to amend the installation directory, or `Next` to continue.

![PEM Agent Wizard - Ready to install](../../images/pem_agent_windows_installation_ready_to_begin.png)

Click `Next` on the `Ready to Install` dialog to instruct the installer to copy files to the system and register the Agent on the PEM server.

![PEM Agent Wizard - Installation in progress](../../images/pem_agent_windows_installation_in_progress.png)

The PEM Agent installer displays progress bars to mark the PEM Agent's installation progress.

![PEM Agent Wizard - Finish Installation dialog](../../images/pem_agent_windows_installation_complete.png)

When the installation has completed, the PEM Agent will be running and reporting operating system and host data to the PEM server. To start monitoring Postgres instances on the host of the PEM agent, they must now be added to PEM’s enterprise directory and bound to the agent.

## Invoking the Agent Installer from the Command Line

The command line options of the PEM Agent installers offer functionality in situations where a graphical installation may not work because of limited resources or system configuration. You can:

-   Include the `--mode unattended` option when invoking the installer to perform an installation without additional user input.

Not all command line options are suitable for all platforms. For a complete reference guide to the command line options, include the `--help` option when you invoke the installer.

### Invoking the PEM Agent Installer in Unattended Mode

You can perform an unattended PEM server installation by providing installation preferences on the command line when invoking the installer. Please note that the system on which you are installing the PEM server must have internet access.

Before invoking the PEM Agent installer in unattended mode, you must:

-   Install the PEM server; the `pg_hba.conf` file of the PEM server must allow connections from the host of the PEM Agent.
-   Ensure that the monitored Postgres database has SSL enabled, and is accepting connections.

You must have Administrator privileges to install the PEM Agent. Use the following command to invoke the PEM Agent installer in unattended mode:

```text
pem-agent-7.<x>.<x>-windows-x64.exe --mode unattended
--pghost <pem_server_host_address> --pgport <pem_server_port>
--pguser postgres --pgpassword <pguser_password>
--agent_description <agent_name>
```

Where:

-   `pem_server_host_address` specifies the IP address of the host of the PEM server.
-   `pem_server_port` specifies the port used by the backing PEM database; by default, the database uses port `5432`.
-   `pguser_password` specifies the password associated with the PEM database superuser.
-   `agent_name` specifies a descriptive name for the PEM Agent.

!!! Note
    When configuring a shell/batch script run by a Windows Agent that has PEM 7.11 or later version installed, the `AllowBatchJobSteps` parameter must be set to `True` in the `agent.cfg` file. The PEM agent will not execute any batch/shell script by default.
