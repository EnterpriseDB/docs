The easiest PEM server installation configuration consists of a PEM backend database server (hosted on a PostgreSQL database installed with the PEM server installer) and a PEM-HTTPD service that reside on the same host. In this configuration, the PEM server installer will provide the pre-requisite software for the backend host register the service (on Windows).

To invoke the PEM server installer on a Windows system, right click the installer icon and select `Run as Administrator`. The installer displays a `Welcome` dialog.

![PEM Server Wizard - Welcome dialog](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_welcome_wizard.png)

Click `Next` to continue to the `License Agreement` dialog.

![PEM Server Wizard - License Agreement dialog](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_license_agreement.png)

Carefully review the license agreement before highlighting the appropriate radio button and accepting the agreement. Click `Next` to continue to the `Installation Directory` dialog.

![PEM Server Wizard - Installation directory dialog](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_installation_directory.png)

Use the `Installation Directory` dialog to specify the location of the PEM server:

-   By default, the PEM server is installed in `C:\Program Files\edb\pem` on Windows. Accept the default location, or use the `Installation Directory` button to open a browser dialog and select the directory in which the PEM server will be installed.
-   Use the `Show advanced options` check box to instruct the installer to open the `Advanced options` dialog.
-   Use the `Advanced options` dialog when installing the Postgres database server and the PEM-HTTPD on different hosts, or if you wish the PEM server to reside on an existing Postgres server installation.

To install the PostgreSQL server packaged with the installer and PEM-HTTPD on the same host, leave the `Show advanced options` box unchecked and click `Next`.

The PEM server installer will perform a pre-installation check for PEM-HTTPD, Language Pack, and PostgreSQL 13. If the installer does not locate these packages, it will inform you in the `Dependency missing` dialog.

!!! Note
    By default EDB Language Pack is installed in `C:\edb\languagepack\v1`.

![PEM Server Wizard - Dependencies check dialog](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_prerequisites_checks.png)

If the dependencies are missing, the PEM server installer will launch the respective installation wizards; follow the onscreen directions presented by the installation wizards for each package.

After installing any missing dependencies, the installation process continues by displaying the `Database Server Installation Details` dialog.

![PEM Server Wizard - Database Server Installation details dialog](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_pgsql_credentials.png)

The information provided on the `Database Server Installation Details` dialog enables the installer to connect to the PostgreSQL server. Provide the `User name` and `Password` of a database superuser. After supplying the requested information, click `Next` to continue to the `pemAgent Service Account` dialog.

![PEM Server Wizard - pemAgent Service Account Password dialog](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_pemagent_service_account_password.png)

After providing the name and password of the Postgres database superuser, you may be prompted for the password to the user account under which the PEM agent will run. If prompted, provide the password, and press `Next` to continue to the `Network Details` dialog.

![Supply the network address from which the agent will connect](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_network_details.png)

Use the `Network Details` dialog to specify the CIDR-style network address from which the PEM agents will connect to the server (the *client-side* address).

You may specify the address of a network host, or a network address range. For example, if you wish to monitor database servers with the addresses `192.168.10.23`, `192.168.10.76` and `192.168.10.184`, enter `192.168.10.0/24` to allow connections with hosts in that network.

The specified address will be added to the server's `pg_hba.conf` file. You can specify additional network addresses by manually adding entries to the `pg_hba.conf` file on the PostgreSQL server if required, using the initial entry as a template.

When you've added the `Network address`, click `Next` to continue to the `Agent Details` dialog.

The PEM server installer will install a PEM agent on the host on which the server resides, to monitor the server and provide alert processing and garbage collection services. A certificate will also be installed in the location specified in the `Agent certificate path` field.

![PEM Server Wizard - Agent Description and Certificate Path dialog](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_agent_details.png)

Enter an alternate description or select an alternate agent certificate path for the PEM agent, or accept the defaults. Click `Next` to continue to the `Ready to Install` dialog.

![PEM Server Wizard - Ready to Install dialog](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_installation_begins.png)

The wizard is now ready to install the PEM server.

Click `Back` to modify any of the options previously selected, or `Next` to continue with the installation.

![PEM Server Wizard - Installation in progress](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_installation_in_progress.png)

During the installation process, the installer will copy files to the system, and set up the database and web services required to run PEM. When the installation completes, a popup dialog opens confirming that the webservice has been configured, and is listening on port `8443`, and that the `pem` database has been created and configured.

![PEM Server Wizard - pem database created](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_db_pem_created.png)

Click `OK` to acknowledge that the webservice has been configured, and that the `pem` database has been created, and continue to the `Completed`… dialog.
