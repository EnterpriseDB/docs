Postres Enterprise Manager requires a Postgres server running either [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest) or [PostgresSQL](/supported-open-source/postgresql/) version 11 or later to hold the Postgres Enterprise Manager backend database. 
  
  1. Set up the repository

     Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

     -  To set up the EDB repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

     -  To set up the PostgreSQL community repository, go to [yum](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/redhat/) or [apt](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt).
   
   !!! Note
       The PostgreSQL community repository is required only if you are using PostgreSQL as the backend database for PEM server.

  2. Install the Postgres server. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server on Linux](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux) or [Installing PostgreSQL](/supported-open-source/postgresql/installer/).
  
  3. Configure authentication on the Postgres server by updating the `pg_hba.conf` file. The `pg_hba.conf` file manages connections. Verify that the `pg_hba.conf` file allows connections from the PEM server, the monitoring PEM agent, and the host of the Apache web server server. Pointers for configuring access:
  
     - PEM server connects to the PEM backend database as a superuser using password authentication. On Linux platforms, this requires you to add a new superuser that authenticates using a password.
     
     - To allow the new superuser to connect using password authentication, add a line `pg_hba.conf` that allows `host` connections using `md5` or `scram-sha-256` authentication.

     - If you're using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, see [Modifying the pg_hba.conf file](/pem/latest/managing_database_server/#modifying-the-pg_hbaconf-file).

     - If you're using PostgreSQL, see [Client Authentication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

  4.  Verify that the sslutils extension and hstore contrib module are installed on your Postgres server.

      -   If you're using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the sslutils extension and hstore contrib module are installed by default.

      -   If you're using PostgreSQL, make sure you have access to the PostgreSQL community repository ([yum](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/redhat/), [apt](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt)), and then install the sslutils extension and the hstore contrib module: 

          For RHEL/AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux 8:
          
          ```shell
          dnf install sslutils_<x> postgresql<x>-contrib
          ```

          Where `<x>` is the Postgres server version.

          For RHEL/OL/CentOS 7:
          
          ```shell
          yum install sslutils_<x> postgresql<x>-contrib
          ```

          Where `<x>` is the Postgres server version.

          For Debian/Ubuntu:
          
          ```shell
          apt install postgresql-<x>-sslutils
          ```

          Where `<x>` is the Postgres server version.

          For SLES:
          
          ```shell
          zypper install sslutils_<x> postgresql<x>-contrib
          ```

          Where `<x>` is the Postgres server version.

      !!! Note For Debian and Ubuntu users     
          The postgres community repository for apt (used by Debian and Ubuntu) does not include `sslutils` and therefore this must be installed from the EDB repository along with [PEM](/installing_pem_server_using_edb_repository/index.mdx).
          
          Debian 10 and Ubuntu 20 changed the requirements for accepting certificates.

            -   If you want to install the PEM agent on a machine with an old version of sslutils, then you must upgrade sslutils to 1.3. Version 1.3 has a 4096-bit RSA key and sha256 signature algorithm support added to it.
            -   If you don't upgrade sslutils to 1.3, then PEM agent might fail to connect to the PEM backend database server, and it might log the error "ca md too weak."

   4.  If you're using a firewall, allow access to port 8443 on the Postgres server:

     For RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux/OL/CentOS/SLES:

       ```shell
       firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8443/tcp
     
       firewall-cmd --reload
       ```
       
     For Debian/Ubuntu:

       ```shell
       iptables -t filter -A INPUT -p TCP --dport 8443 -j ACCEPT
       ```

Make sure the components Postgres Enterprise Manager depends on, such as python3, libboost, openssl (1.0.2k or later), snmp++, and libcurl, are up to date: 

   For RHEL/AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux 8:

   ```shell
   dnf upgrade
   ```

   For RHEL/OL/CentOS 7:
   
   ```shell
   yum upgrade
   ```

   For Debian/Ubuntu:
   
   ```shell
   apt-get update
   ```

   For SLES:
   
   ```shell
   zypper update
   ```

## Supported locales

Currently, the Postgres Enterprise Manager server and web interface support a locale of `English(US) en_US` and use of a period (.) as a language separator character. Using an alternate locale or a separator character other than a period might cause errors.
