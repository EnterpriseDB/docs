Postres Enterprise Manager requires a Postgres server running either [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest) or [PostgresSQL](/supported-open-source/postgresql/) version 11 or later to hold the Postgres Enterprise Manager backend database. 
  
  1. Install the Postgres server. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server on Linux](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux) or [Installing PostgreSQL](/supported-open-source/postgresql/installer/).
  
  2. Configure authentication on the Postgres server by updating the `pg_hba.conf` file. The `pg_hba.conf` file manages connections. Verify that the `pg_hba.conf` file allows connections from the PEM server, the monitoring PEM agent, and the host of the Apache web server server.
  
     - If you're using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, see [Modifying the pg_hba.conf file](/pem/latest/managing_database_server/#modifying-the-pg_hbaconf-file).

     - If you're using PostgreSQL, see [Client Authentication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

  3.  Verify that the sslutils extension and hstore contrib module are installed on your Postgres server.

      -   If you're using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the sslutils extension and hstore contrib module are installed by default.

      -   If you're using PostgreSQL, make sure you have access to the PostgreSQL community repository, and then install the sslutils extension and the hstore contrib module: 

          For RHEL/AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux 8:
          
          ```shell
          dnf install sslutils-<x> postgresql<x>-contrib
          ```

          Where `x` is the Postgres server version.

          For RHEL/OL/CentOS 7:
          
          ```shell
          yum install sslutils_<X>-<version> postgresql<x>-contrib
          ```

          Where `x` is the Postgres server version and `<version>` is the sslutils version number.

          For Debian/Ubuntu:
          
          ```shell
          apt install postgresql-<X>-sslutils_<version> postgresql<x>-contrib
          ```

          Where `x` is the Postgres server version and `<version>` is the sslutils version number.

          For SLES:
          
          ```shell
          zypper install sslutils_<X>-<version> postgresql<x>-contrib
          ```

          Where `x` is the Postgres server version and `<version>` is the sslutils version number.

      !!! Note
          Debian 10 and Ubuntu 20 increased the requirements to accept the certificates due to security reason.

            -   If you want to install the PEM agent on any of the machines, you must upgrade ssltuils to 1.3 where 4096-bit RSA key and sha256 signature algorithm support was added.
            -   If you don't upgrade sslutils to 1.3, then PEM agent might fail to connect to the PEM backend database server, and it might log the error "ca md too weak."

   4.  If you're using a firewall, allow access to port 8443 on the Postgres server:

     For RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux/OL/CentOS/SLES:

       ```shell
       firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8443/tcp
     
       firewall-cmd --reload
       ```
       
     For Debian/Ubuntu:

       ```shell
       iptables -t filter -A INPUT -p TCP --dport 8443 -j ACCEPT
       ```

Make sure the components Postgres Enterprise Manager depends on, such as python3, libboost, openssl (1.0.2k or later), snmp++, and libcurl, are up to date: 

   For RHEL/AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux 8:

   ```shell
   dnf upgrade
   ```

   For RHEL/OL/CentOS 7:
   
   ```shell
   yum upgrade
   ```

   For Debian/Ubuntu:
   
   ```shell
   apt-get update
   ```

   For SLES:
   
   ```shell
   zypper update
   ```
