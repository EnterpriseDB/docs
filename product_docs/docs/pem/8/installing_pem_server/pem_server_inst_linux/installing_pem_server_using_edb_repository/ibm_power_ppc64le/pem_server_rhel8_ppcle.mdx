## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Review the [prerequisites](/pem/latest/installing_pem_server/pem_server_inst_linux/prerequisites/).

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

## Install the package

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-pem
```

## Initial configuration

```shell
# You can configure the PEM server using the following command:
/usr/edb/pem/bin/configure-pem-server.sh
```

For more details, see [Configuring the PEM Server on Linux](/pem/latest/installing_pem_server/installing_on_linux/configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux/).

!!! Note

- The operating system user pem is created while installing the PEM server. The PEM server web application is a WSGI application, which runs under Apache HTTPD. The pem application data and the session is saved to this user's home directory.
