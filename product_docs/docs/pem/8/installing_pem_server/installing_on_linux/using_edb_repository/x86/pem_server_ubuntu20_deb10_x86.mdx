The following steps will walk you through using the EDB `apt` repository to install a Debian package.

!!! Note
    You can also visit <https://repos.enterprisedb.com/> and select the platform and product to view the steps for installation.

1.  Log in as root on your Debian or Ubuntu host:

    ```text
    sudo su -
    ```

## Prerequisites

- Postres Enterprise Manager requires a Postgres server running either [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest) or [PostgresSQL](/supported-open-source/postgresql/) version 11 or later to hold the Postgres Enterprise Manager backend database. 
  
  1. Install the Postgres server. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server on Linux](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux) or [Installing PostgreSQL](/supported-open-source/postgresql/installer/).
  
  2. Configure authentication on the Postgres server by updating the pg_hba.conf file. The pg_hba.conf file manages connections. You must ensure that the pg_hba.conf file allows connections from the PEM server, the monitoring PEM agent, and the host of the Apache web server server.
  
     - If you are using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, see [Modifying the pg_hba.conf file](/pem/latest/managing_database_server/#modifying-the-pg_hbaconf-file).

     - If you are using PostgreSQL, see [Client Authentication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

  3.  Ensure that the `sslutils` extension and `hstore` contrib module are installed on your Postgres server.

      -   If you are using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the `sslutils` extension and `hstore` contrib module are installed by default.

      -   If you are PostgreSQL, ensure you have access to the PostgreSQL community repository, and then install the `sslutils` extension and the `hstore` contrib module: 

          ```shell
          apt install postgresql-<x>_sslutils postgresql<x>-contrib
          ```

          Where, `x` is the Postgres server version.

      !!! Note
          Debian 10 and Ubuntu 20 has increased the requirements to accept the certificates due to security reason.

            -   If a user wants to install the PEM agent on any of the machines, they must upgrade ssltuils to 1.3 where 4096 bit RSA key and sha256 signature algorithm support has added.
            -   If a user does not upgrade sslutils to 1.3, then PEM agent may fail to connect to the PEM backend database server, and it might log the error ca md too weak.

   4.  If you are using a firewall, allow access to port `8443` on the Postgres server:

       ```text
        iptables -t filter -A INPUT -p TCP --dport 8443 -j ACCEPT
       ```

-  Ensure the components Postgres Enterprise Manager depends on such as python3, libboost, openssl (1.0.2k or later), snmp++, and libcurl are up to date, using the following command: 

   ```text
   apt-get update
   ```

## Configure the EDB repository

a.  Set up the EnterpriseDB repository:

```text
sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs)main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
```

b.  Substitute your EnterpriseDB credentials for the `<username>` and `<password>` placeholders in the following command:

```text
sh -c 'echo "machine apt.enterprisedb.com login <username> password <password>" > /etc/apt/auth.conf.d/edb.conf'
```
    
To request credentials for the repository, contact [EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

## Add support to your system for secure APT repositories

```text
apt-get install apt-transport-https
```

## Add the EBD signing key

```text
wget -q -O -https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add â€“
```

## Update the repository metadata

```text
apt-get update
```

## Install the PEM server

```text
apt-get install edb-pem
```

!!! Note
    The operating system user `pem` gets created while installing the PEM Server. The PEM Server web application is a WSGI application, which runs under Apache HTTPD. The pem application data and the session gets saved to this user's home directory.

When the installation completes, you must configure the PEM Server. For detailed information see [Configuring the PEM Server on Linux Platforms](../../configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux/).
