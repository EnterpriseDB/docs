On a Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux system, you can use the `yum` package manager or `dnf` command to install a PEM Server; the installation tool you use will be dependent on the version of the host operating system. Before installing the server, you must ensure that your system contains the required prerequisite software listed below.

**Install the `epel-release` package**

```text
dnf -y install epel-release
```


**Enable the powertools repository since EPEL packages may depend on packages from it**

```text
dnf config-manager --set-enabled powertools
```

## Prerequisites

- Postres Enterprise Manager requires a Postgres server running either [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest) or [PostgresSQL](/supported-open-source/postgresql/) version 11 or later to hold the Postgres Enterprise Manager backend database. 
  
  1. Install the Postgres server. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server on Linux](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux) or [Installing PostgreSQL](/supported-open-source/postgresql/installer/).
  
  2. Configure authentication on the Postgres server by updating the pg_hba.conf file. The pg_hba.conf file manages connections. You must ensure that the pg_hba.conf file allows connections from the PEM server, the monitoring PEM agent, and the host of the Apache web server server.
  
     - If you are using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, see [Modifying the pg_hba.conf file](/pem/latest/managing_database_server/#modifying-the-pg_hbaconf-file).

     - If you are using PostgreSQL, see [Client Authentication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

  3.  Ensure that the `sslutils` extension and `hstore` contrib module are installed on your Postgres server.

      -   If you are using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the `sslutils` extension and `hstore` contrib module are installed by default.

      -   If you are PostgreSQL, ensure you have access to the PostgreSQL community repository, and then install the `sslutils` extension and the `hstore` contrib module: 

          ```shell
          dnf install postgresql-<x>_sslutils postgresql<x>-contrib
          ```

          Where, `x` is the Postgres server version.

   4.  If you are using a firewall, allow access to port `8443` on the Postgres server:

       ```text
       firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8443/tcp
     
       firewall-cmd --reload
       ```

-  Ensure the components Postgres Enterprise Manager depends on such as python3, libboost, openssl (1.0.2k or later), snmp++, and libcurl are up to date, using the following command: 

   ```text
   dnf upgrade
   ```

## Install and configure the edb.repo file

To create an EnterpriseDB repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

```text
dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`. After creating the `edb.repo` file, use the following command to replace the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the `<username>` and `<password>` of a registered EDB user:

```text
sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
```

To request credentials for the repository, contact [EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

## Disbale the built-in PostgreSQL module

```text
dnf -qy module disable PostgreSQL
```

## Install the PEM server

After meeting the platform-specific prerequisites listed above, you can use dnf to install the PEM Server:

```text
dnf install edb-pem
```

!!! Note
    The operating system user `pem` gets created while installing the PEM Server. The PEM Server web application is a WSGI application, which runs under Apache HTTPD. The pem application data and the session gets saved to this user's home directory.

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

If you want to install PEM server on a machine that is in isolated network, you must first create PEM repository on that machine. For more information about creating PEM repository on an isolated network, see [Creating a PEM repository in an Isolated Network](../../creating_pem_repository_in_isolated_network/).

After installing PEM Server using `yum` or `dnf`, you need to configure the PEM Server. For more detailed information see [Configuring the PEM Server on Linux platforms](../../configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux/).
