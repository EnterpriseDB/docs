[Logical replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/logical-replication.html) uses a `publish` and `subscribe` model with one or more `subscribers` subscribing to one or more `publications` on a publisher node.

Use the `publication` dialog to create a publication. A publication is a set of changes generated from a table or a group of tables, and might also be described as a change set or replication set.

The `publication` dialog organizes the development of a publication through the following dialog tabs: `General` and `Definition`. The `SQL` tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

Use the fields in the `General` tab to identify the publication:

-   Use the `Name` field to add a descriptive name for the publication. The name will be displayed in the Browser tree control.
-   The `Owner` field takes the name of the user automatically as current connected user. You can change the owner after creating publication using alter publication.

Click the `Definition` tab to continue.

Use the `Definition` tab to set properties for the publication:

-   Move the switch next to `All tables?` to `Yes` to replicate all the tables of the database, including tables created in the future.
-   Move the switch next to `Only table?` to `Yes` to replicate only the listed tables excluding all its descendant tables.
-   Specify a table or list of tables separated by a comma in `Tables` field to replicate all the listed table.
-   Use the `With` section to determine which DML operations will be published by the new publication to the subscribers. Move the switch next to `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `TRUNCATE` to `No` if you do not want to replicate any of these DML operations from Publication to Subscription. By default, all the switches are set to `Yes` allowing all the DML operations.

!!! Note
    A published table must have a `replica identity` configured in order to be able to replicate UPDATE and DELETE operations. You can change with ALTER TABLE statement. For more information on replica identity see [Logical Replication Publication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/logical-replication-publication.html).

Click the `SQL` tab to continue.

Your entries in the `Publication` dialog generate a SQL command (see an example below). Use the `SQL` tab for review; revisit or switch tabs to make any changes to the SQL command.

**Example**

The following is an example of the sql command generated by user selections in the `Publication` dialog:

![Publication dialog sql tab](../../images/publication_sql.png)

The example creates a publication named `pub1` that is owned by `postgres`. It allows replication of all the DML operations.
