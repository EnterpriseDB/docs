The PEM client features a menu bar and a window divided into two panes: the `Browser` tree control in the left pane, and a tabbed browser in the right pane.

![PEM browser window](../images/pem_browser_window.png)

[Menus](03_pem_menu_bar/#pem_menu_bar) displayed across the top of the browser window provide quick, context-sensitive access to PEM features and functionality.

## The PEM Client Object Browser

The `Browser` tree control provides access to information and management options for the database objects that reside on each server. The tree control expands to display a hierarchical view of the servers and objects that are monitored by the PEM server. You can use context menu options (accessed by right-clicking on nodes of the tree control) to create new objects, and modify and delete existing objects if your role holds the required privileges.

Expand nodes in the tree control to display a hierarchical view of the database objects that reside on a selected server:

-   Use the plus sign (+) to the left of a node to expand a segment of the tree control.
-   Click the minus sign (-) to the left of a node to close that node.

Right-click on a node of the tree control to access a context-sensitive menu and perform common tasks. Context menu options may include one or more of the following selections:

| Option                    | Action                                                                                                                                                                             |

-   The `Tuples In` graph displays the number of tuples inserted, updated, and deleted on the server or database.
-   The `Tuples out` graph displays the number of tuples fetched and returned from the server or database.
-   The `Block I/O` graph displays the number of blocks read from the filesystem or fetched from the buffer cache (but not the operating system's file system cache) for the server or database.
-   The `Server activity` tabbed panel displays tables that contain session information, session locks, prepared transactions and configuration.

![PEM browser - Properties tab](../images/pem_browser_properties.png)

Navigate to the `Properties` tab to review the properties of the item currently highlighted in the tree control.

![PEM browser - SQL tab](../images/pem_browser_sql.png)

The `SQL` tab displays the SQL code used to generate the object currently selected in the Browser tree control.

![PEM browser - Statistics tab](../images/pem_browser_statistics.png)

The `Statistics` tab displays the statistics gathered for each object on the tree control; the statistics displayed in the table vary by the type of object that is highlighted. Click a column heading to sort the table by the data displayed in the column; click again to reverse the sort order. The following table lists some of the statistics that may be displayed:

| Panel                     | Description                                                                                                |

![PEM browser - Dependencies tab](../images/pem_browser_dependencies.png)

The `Dependencies` tab displays the objects on which the currently selected object depends. To ensure the integrity of the database structure, the server makes sure that you do not accidentally drop objects that other objects depend on; you must use DROP CASCADE to remove an object on which another object depends.

The `Dependencies` table displays:

-   The `Type` field specifies the parent object type.
-   The `Name` field specifies the identifying name of the parent object.
-   The `Restriction` field describes the dependency relationship between the currently selected object and the parent.

![PEM browser - Dependents tab](../images/pem_browser_dependents.png)

The `Dependents` tab displays a table of objects that depend on the object currently selected in the Browser tree. A dependent object can be dropped without affecting the object currently selected in the Browser tree control.

-   The `Type` field specifies the dependent object type.
-   The `Name` field specifies the identifying name for the dependent object.
-   The `Restriction` field describes the dependency relationship between the currently selected object and the parent.
-   Navigate to the `Monitoring` tab to access information presented on [PEM dashboards](../04_toc_pem_features/01_dashboards/#dashboards). Dashboards display statistical information about the objects monitored by the PEM server.

![PEM browser - Global Overview tab](../images/global_overview.png)

PEM will open additional tabs when you access PEM functionality through the `Management` or `Tools` dialogs. Right-click the current tab and select from a context menu that allows you to customize the display for your working style:

-   Click `Remove Panel` to remove the currently selected panel.
-   Click `Rename Panel` to rename the currently selected panel.
-   Click `Detach Panel` to detach the currently selected panel, repositioning it for convenience.
-   Click `Add Panel` and select any of the available options to be added to the panels.

The PEM client will preserve any adjustments when you exit the program; to reset the PEM client to its original format, select `Reset Layout` from the `File` menu.

## Using Chart, Graph and Table Controls

Use the icons in the upper-right corner of each graphic on a PEM Client dashboard to control, download, and customize the charts, graphs and tables displayed in the PEM client.

![PEM Agent and Server Status](../images/chart_icons.png)

Use the `Refresh` icon ![refresh](../images/lgrefresh.png) to display the most-recent content available from the PEM probes.

Select the `Download` icon ![download](../images/lgdownload.png) to download a .jpeg or .png image of the chart or graph. By default, the file will be in .jpeg format; to save the file as a .png, use the `Personalize` icon to modify the download format.

Select the `Fullscreen` icon ![fullscreen](../images/lgfullscreen.png) to expand the chart or graph to fill the main pane of the PEM client.

Select the `Personalize` ![personal](../images/lgpersonalize.png) icon to modify the display properties of the chart or graph for your session only.

Use the `Information` ![info](../images/lginformation.png) icon to access information about the chart or graph.

**Personalizing a Graphic**

When you select the `Personalize` icon, the `Personalize chart configuration` dialog opens:

![PEM personalize chart options](../images/personalize_chart.png)

Use controls on the `Personalize chart configuration` dialog to modify the properties of the graphic:

-   Use the `Auto Refresh` control to increase or decrease the number of seconds between refreshes.
-   Use the `Auto Refresh` field to specify the number of seconds between updates of the data displayed in the table or chart.
-   If applicable, use the `Download as` field to indicate if you would like a chart to be downloaded as a JPEG image or a PNG image.
-   If applicable, use the `Colours` selectors to specify the display colors that will be used on a chart.
-   If applicable, set the `Show Acknowledged Alerts` switch to `Yes` indicate that you would like the table to display alerts that you have acknowledged with a checkbox in the `Ack'ed` column. Set the field to `No` to indicate that the table should hide any acknowledged alerts. The switch acts as a toggle; acknowledged alerts are not purged from the table content until the time specified in the alert definition passes.

After personalizing the display properties, use the controls in the upper-right hand corner to apply your changes:
