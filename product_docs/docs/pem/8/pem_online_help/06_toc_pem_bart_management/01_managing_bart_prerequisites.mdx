-   Before adding a BART server to the PEM console, you must manually install and configure BART on the BART host. For more information about installing and configuring BART, please see the `BART Installation Guide` available at:

    [https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs](/bart/latest/bart_inst/)

-   Before associating a database server with a BART server, you must install SSH on the database server and the BART server.

-   Before restoring a BART backup, you must install BART, PEM agent, and SSH on the target server. SSH must also be installed on the BART server that you plan to use for restore.

-   To take a backup of the replica database servers, you must ensure that the latest `pg_basebackup` utility is installed on the database server that you want to manage through BART.
