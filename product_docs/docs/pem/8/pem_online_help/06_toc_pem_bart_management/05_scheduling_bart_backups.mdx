To schedule a backup using BART, select `Schedule Backup` under `Tools` menu. You can see a list of scheduled backups with details such as `Logs`, *Last result*, `Database server`, *Last backup name*, `Started on`, *Type*, `Parent`, *Format*, `Verify checksum?`, and `Use pg_basebackup?`. Click the Add icon (+) to add a schedule for the backup. Enter the details in the schedule definition dialog:

![Schedule Backups dialog - General tab](../images/BART_backup_scheduler_general.png)

Use the fields on the `General` tab to describe the general properties of the backup:

-   Use the `Database Server` field to specify the target database server that you want to back up.
-   Use the `Backup name` to specify a user-defined name for the backup.
-   Use the `Backup type` switch to specify the backup type I. e. full backup or incremental backup.
-   Use the `Parent backup` field to select the ID of the parent backup for incremental backup. This parent backup can either be a full or an incremental backup.
-   Use the `Format switch` to specify the output format of the backup i.e plain text or tar. For incremental backup, you need to select plain text only.
-   Use the `Gzip compression` switch to specify if gzip compression should be enabled for the backup. This option is applicable only for the tar format.
-   Use the `Compression level` field to specify the gzip compression level on the tar file output.
-   Use the `Thread count` field to specify the number of threads that will copy the blocks.
-   Use the `MBM scan timeout` field to specify the number of seconds to wait for required MBM files before timing out.
-   Use the `Checksum algorithm` field to specify checksum algorithm for MBM files of the backup.
-   Use the `Verify checksum` field to specify if you want the application to verify the checksum of the backup.
-   Use the `pg_basebackup` field to specify if the pg_basebackup utility should be used for the backup. Typically, pg_basebackup utility is used only for backing up the replica servers since it cannot be used for incremental backups.

Provide information on the `Schedule` tab to describe the scheduling details:

-   Use the `Enabled?` switch to indicate if the schedule should be enabled (`Yes`) or disabled (`No`).
-   Use the calendar selector in the `Start` field to specify the starting date and time for the schedule.
-   Use the calendar selector in the `End` field to specify the ending date and time for the schedule.

![Schedule Backups dialog - Schedule Repeat tab](../images/BART_backup_scheduler_schedule_repeat.png)

Use the fields on the `Repeat` tab to specify the details about the schedule in a cron-style format. The schedule will execute on each date or time element selected on the `Repeat` tab. Click within a field to open a list of valid values for that field; click on a specific value to add that value to the list of selected values for the field. To clear the values from a field, click the `X` located at the right-side of the field.

Use the fields within the `Days` box to specify the days on which the schedule will execute:

-   Use the `Week Days` field to select the days on which the schedule will execute.
-   Use the `Month Days` field to select the numeric days on which the schedule will execute. Specify the Last Day to indicate that the schedule should be performed on the last day of the month, regardless of the date.
-   Use the `Months` field to select the months in which the schedule will execute.

Use the fields within the `Times` box to specify the times at which the schedule will execute:

-   Use the `Hours` field to select the hour at which the schedule will execute.
-   Use the `Minutes` field to select the minute at which the schedule will execute.

![Schedule Backups dialog - Notifications tab](../images/BART_backup_scheduler_schedule_notifications.png)

Use the fields on the `Notifications` tab to specify the email notification settings for a scheduled backup:

-   Use the `Send the notifications` field to specify when you want the email notifications to be sent.
-   Use the `Email group` field to specify the email group that should receive the email notification.
