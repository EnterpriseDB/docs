The PEM web interface uses Apache to connect to the PEM server on port 8080 of the IP address on which the PEM server is installed. To connect to PEM, open your browser of choice, and navigate to:

> *&lt;ip_address_of_PEM_host>:8080/pem*

Where `ip_address_of_PEM_host` specifies the IP address of the host of the PEM server.

If the PEM Server is using the `Kerberos Authentication`, you will be directly connected to the PEM interface without having to login.

Use the fields on the Login window to authenticate yourself with the PEM server:

-   Provide the name of a `pem` database user in the `Username` field. Users logon to PEM using user credentials setup as `login roles` on the PostgreSQL database used by the PEM server. By default, the `postgres` superuser account will be used for the initial logon.

    We strongly recommend you create an individual role for each user. You can create a login role with the `CREATE ROLE` SQL statement, or by defining a role with the PEM client `Create - Login/Group Role` dialog. To access the dialog, connect to the PEM server database; right-click the `Login/Group Roles` node in the tree control, and select `New Login Role...` from the `Create` pull-aside menu. Roles must be granted permissions and role memberships to properly use PEM:

    -   users that are members of the `pem_user` role are essentially `read-only` users; they may view dashboards, change the database server connection options, but they will not be able to install agents or configure the server directory, alerts, probes, or run any of the wizard/dialog based components of PEM.
    -   users that are members of the `pem_admin` role have the same read permissions as members of the pem_user role, plus sufficient privileges to configure the servers, directory, alerts and probes.
    -   `administrative` users must be added to the pem_admin role and explicitly granted the create role privilege. in addition to the permissions granted through membership in the pem_admin role, the create role privilege allows an administrator to create additional pem users, and to install and register new agents.
    -   users can be member of one of the [PEM roles](04_pem_roles/#pem_roles) to give right to run a particular component, to manage, or to configure PEM.

-   Provide the password associated with the user in the `Password` field.

!!! Note
    From PEM 8.2 onwards, the Two-Factor Authentication support is added. For more information see `PEM Installation guides` on [EDB Doc Website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pem/latest/).

After providing your credentials, click `Login` to connect to the PEM client. PEM opens, displaying the `Global Overview` Dashboard:
