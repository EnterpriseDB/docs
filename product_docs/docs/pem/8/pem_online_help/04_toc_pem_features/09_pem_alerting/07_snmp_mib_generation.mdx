PEM allows alerts to be sent as SNMP traps or notifications to receivers such as network monitoring tools. To enable such tools to understand these notifications, a MIB file may be generated that describes the different alerts and accompanying information that PEM may send. The `pem.generate_alert_mib()` SQL function in the PEM database may be used to generate the MIB file from the alert templates defined in the database. For example:

```
psql.exe -U postgres -d pem -A -t -c "SELECT pem.generate_alert_mib();" > PEM-ALERTING-MIB
```
