Use the `Custom Probes` tab to create a new probe or modify an existing probe. After creating or modifying a probe, you can incorporate the data gathered by custom probes into existing or new charts or graphs. To open the `Custom Probes` tab, select the `Manage Custom Probes` icon from the `Quick Links` section of the `Manage Probes` tab.

![Custom Probes](../../images/custom_probes.png)

Use the `Show system probes?` switch to display the system probes on the `Custom Probes` tab.

To modify an existing probe, click the `Edit` icon located to the left of a probe name.

## Defining a New Probe

To create a new probe, click the `Add` icon in the upper-right corner of the tab.

![Custom Probes - Add New Probe - General tab](../../images/custom_probes_general.png)

Use the fields on the `General` tab to modify the definition of an existing probe or to specify the properties of a new probe.

-   Use the `Probe name` field to provide a name for a new probe.
-   Use the `Collection method` field to specify the probe type. Use the drop-down listbox to select from:

> -   `SQL` (the probe will gather information via a SQL statement)
>
> -   `WMI` (the probe will gather information via a Windows Management Instrumentation extension)
>
> -   `Batch/Shell Script` (the probe will use a command-script or shell-script to gather information).
>
>     Before creating a batch probe on a Linux system, you must modify the `agent.cfg` file, setting the `allow_batch_probes` parameter equal to `true` and restart the PEM agent. The `agent.cfg` file is located in `/opt/PEM/agent/etc`.
>
>     On 64-bit Windows systems, agent settings are stored in the registry. Before creating a batch probe, modify the registry entry for the `AllowBatchProbes` registry entry and restart the PEM agent. PEM registry entries are located in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\EnterpriseDB\\PEM\\agent`.
>
>     Please note that batch probes are platform-specific. If you specify a collection method of `Batch`, you must specify a platform type in the `Platform` field.
>
>     To invoke a script on a Linux system, you must modify the entry for `batch_script_user` parameter of agent.cfg file and specify the user that should be used to run the script. You can either specify a non-root user or root for this parameter. If you do not specify a user, or the specified user does not exist, then the script will not be executed. Restart the agent after modifying the file. If pemagent is being run by a non-root user then the value of `batch_script_user` will be ignored and the script will be executed by the same non-root user that is being used for running the pemagent.

-   Use the `Target type` drop-down listbox to select the object type that the probe will monitor. `Target type` is disabled if `Collection method` is `WMI`.
-   Use the `Minutes` and `Seconds` selectors to specify how often the probe will collect data.
-   Use the `Probe enable?` switch to specify if the probe is enabled. Specify `Yes` to enable the probe, or `No` to specify that the probe is disabled.
-   Set the `Data retention` switch to `Yes` to specify the number of days that gathered information will be retained in the probe's history table.
-   Use the switch next to `Discard from history` to specify if the server should create a history table for the probe. Select `Yes` to discard probe history, or `No` to retain the probe history in a table.
-   Use the `Platform` drop-down listbox to specify the type of platform that the probe will monitor. This field is enabled only when the `Collection method` is `Batch`.

![Custom Probes - Add New Probe - Columns tab](../../images/custom_probes_columns.png)

Use the `Columns` tab to define the columns in which the probe data will be stored. Navigate to the Columns tab, and click the `Add` button (in the upper-right corner) to define a new column.

-   Provide a name for the column in the `Name` field.

-   The `Internal name` field is not enabled for user-defined probes.

-   Use the `Column type` drop-down listbox to specify if the column is a `Key` column (a primary key) or a `Non key` column. Non-key columns are generally metric items (values that can be graphed).

-   Use the `Data type` drop-down listbox to specify the type of data that will be stored in the column.

-   Use the `Unit` field to specify the unit of measure that applies to the metric stored in the column. This unit is displayed on the Y-Axis of a custom chart or a Capacity Manager chart. This is an optional field.

-   Use the `Graphable` switch to specify if the defined metric may be graphed, and that the probe should be accessible from the Capacity Manager or Manage Charts dialogs.

-   Use the `Is PIT` switch to specify if the metric is stored by point-in-time (by default).

    'Point-in-time' metrics are those metrics that change (increase or decrease) at any given point of time. For example, database size is a point-in-time metric; at any given point-in-time, the size of the database is fluctuating. Metrics that are not point-in-time (also referred to as cumulative metrics) are metrics whose size always increases over time. For example, Blocks Read and Tuples Read are cumulative metrics; the value stays the same or increases.

-   Use the `Calculate PIT` switch to specify that the server should calculate a point-in-time value for the metric data. `Calculate PIT` is disabled if `Is PIT` is `Yes`.

PEM allows you to store point-in time-values of cumulative metrics as well. PEM subtracts the last collected value of a cumulative metric from the current value, and stores the difference as a point-in-time value.

![Custom Probes - Add New Probe - Code tab](../../images/custom_probes_code.png)

Use the `Code` tab to specify the default code that will be executed by the probe.

-   If the probe is a SQL probe, you must specify the SQL SELECT statement invoked by the probe on the `Code` tab. The column names returned by the query must match the `Internal Name` specified on the `Column` tab. The number of columns returned by the query, as well as the column name, datatype, etc. must match the information specified on the `Columns` tab.
-   If the probe is a Batch probe, you must specify the shell or .bat script that will be invoked when the probe runs. The output of the script should be as follows:

> -   The first line must contain the names of the columns provided on the `Columns` tab. Each column name should be separated by a tab (t) character.
> -   From the second line onwards, each line should contain the data for each column, separated by a tab character.
> -   If a specified column is defined as key column, make sure the script does not produce duplicate data for that column across lines of output.
> -   The number of columns specified in the `Columns` tab and their names, data type, etc. should match with the output of the script output.

-   If the probe is a WMI probe, you must specify the WMI query as a SELECT WMI query. The column name referenced in the SELECT statement should be same as the name of the corresponding column specified on the `Column` tab. The column names returned by the query must match the `Internal Name` specified on the `Column` tab. The number of columns returned by the query, as well as the column name, datatype, etc. must match the information specified on the `Columns` tab.

![Custom Probes - Add New Probe - Alternate Code tab](../../images/custom_probes_alt_code.png)

Use the `Alternate Code` tab to provide code that will be invoked if the probe fires on a specific version of the server. To provide version-specific code, move the `Applies to all database server versions?` switch to `No`, and click the `Add` button. Then, use the `Database version(s)` drop-down listbox to select the version to which the code will apply. After selecting the version, click the `Edit` button (to the left of the version name) to provide the code that will execute when the probe fires.

If you select a database version, and leave the `Probe code` column blank, PEM will invoke the code specified on the `Code` tab when the probe executes on a server that matches that version.

When you've finished defining the probe, click the `Save` icon (in the corner of the `Custom Probes` tab) to save the definition, and make the probe data available for use on custom charts and graphs.

## Exporting and Importing Probes

From PEM 8.2 onwards, you can export and import the probes to another PEM Server.

To `Export` the probe, select any probe/s from the `Manage Custom Probes` tab and then select the `Export` icon in the upper-right corner of the table. Select `Save File` option and then select `ok`, it will generate the `JSON` file.

![Custom Probes - Export](../../images/custom_probes_export.png)

To `Import` the probe, go to the `Manage Custom Probes` tab and then select the `Import` icon in the upper-right corner of the table.

![Custom Probes - Import](../../images/custom_probes_import.png)

Click on the `Browse` button to select the `JSON` file with the probe code to be imported and then click `Import`.

![Custom Probes - Import Browse](../../images/custom_probes_import_browse.png)

After selecting the file to import you can select the `skip existing` checkbox. If selected then it will skip the probe if it already exists.

If the checkbox is selected and the probe already exists, then it skips importing the probe with the message as below:

![Custom Probes - Import Skipped Message](../../images/custom_probes_import_skip_msg.png)

If the checkbox is not selected and the probe already exists, then it does not import the probe and throws the below error:

![Custom Probes - Import Error](../../images/custom_probes_import_error.png)

!!! Note
    `Import` cannot overwrite the existing probe as it may be configured to retain historical data as per the configured retention policy.

If the checkbox is not selected and probe does not exist but the corresponding table in the `pem` schema exists, then it imports the probe successfully using the same table.

![Custom Probes - Import Successful](../../images/custom_probes_import_successful.png)

!!! Note
    It is possible that probe is deleted and not listed on `Manage Custom Probe` tab, but still the table holding the data of that probe exists in the `pem` schema.

## Deleting Probes

You may delete only user-defined probes. To delete a probe, select the probe name in the probes table, and select the `Delete` icon (located to the upper-right corner of the table). The probe history will persist for the length of time specified on the `History Retention` field in the probe definition. During the deletion the probe definition is deleted and any corresponding tables are dropped from the `pemdata` and `pemhistory` schemas.

System probes are the built-in probes provided by PEM, and are part of the PEM schema. You may only modify system probes; if you attempt to delete a system probe, you will receive an error from PEM.
