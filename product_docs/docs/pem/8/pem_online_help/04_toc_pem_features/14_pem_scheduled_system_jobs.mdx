PEM defines system jobs to take care of cleanup activities at scheduled intervals. All of the system jobs are enabled by default, and are scheduled to deploy on a regular interval. You can query the `pem.job` table in the `pem` database to review a list of the system jobs. The current schedule for system jobs is stored in the `pem.schedule` table in the `pem` database.

The system job names, their descriptions, and default deployment intervals are listed in the table below:

| **Job Name**                 | **Description**                                                                                                               | **Intervals to Run the Job**                                                                                                                                                |
