You can use the PEM dashboard editor to create or modify a user-defined dashboard. The custom dashboard may include pre-defined charts, user-defined charts or a mix of pre-defined and user-defined charts. To create a new dashboard, select `Create New Dashboard...` from the `Quick Links` section of the `Manage Dashboards` tab.

Use the fields in the `Configure` section to specify general information about the dashboard:

-   Specify a name for the dashboard in the `Name` field. The name specified will also be the title of the dashboard if the title is displayed.
-   Use the `Level` drop-down listbox to specify the level of the PEM hierarchy within the PEM client on which the dashboard will be displayed. A dashboard may be accessed via the `Dashboards` menu on a `Global` level, an `Agent` level, the `Server` level or the `Database` level. Each selected level within the list will expose a different set of metrics on which the custom dashboard's charts may be based.
-   Provide a description of the dashboard in the `Description` field.

Provide information in the fields in the `Ops dashboard options` box if the dashboard will be used as an Ops dashboard:

-   Set the `Ops Dashboard?` field to `Yes` to instruct the server to create a dashboard that is formatted for display on an [Ops monitor](02_pem_ops_dashboard/#pem_ops_dashboard).
-   Set the `Show Title?` field to `Yes` to display the dashboard name at the top of the Ops dashboard.
-   Use the `Font` drop-down list box to select a custom font style for the title. The selected font style will be displayed in the `Preview` box.
-   Use the `Font size` drop-down list box to select a custom font size for the title. The selected font style will be displayed in the `Preview` box.

Use the `Permissions` box to specify the users that will be able to view the new dashboard:

-   Set the `Share with all` slider to `Yes` to instruct the server to allow all `Teams` to access the dashboard, or set `Share with all` to `No` to enable the `Access permissions` field.
-   Use the `Access permissions` field to specify which roles can view the new dashboard. Click in the field, and select from the list of users to add a role to the list of users with dashboard access.

When you've completed the `Configure Dashboard` section, click the arrow in the upper-right corner to close the section, and access the `Dashboard Layout Design` section.

Click the edit icon in a section header to specify a section name; then, click the add icon (+) to add a chart to the section.

![Create Custom dashboard - Add Chart options](../../images/pem_custom_dashboard_add_chart.png)

Use the arrows to the right of each chart category to display the charts available and select a chart.

![Create Custom dashboard - Chart Display options](../../images/pem_custom_dashboard_chart_details.png)

Use the chart detail selectors to specify placement details for the chart: \* Use the `Chart width` selector to indicate the width of the chart; select 50% to display the chart in half of the dashboard, or 100% to use the whole dashboard width. \* Use the `Chart alignment` selector to indicate the position of the chart within the section:

> -   Select `Left` to indicate that the chart should be left-justified.
> -   Select `Center` to indicate that the chart should be centered.
> -   Select `Right` to indicate that the chart should be right-justified.

Please note that tables are always displayed centered.

When creating or editing a custom dashboard, you can use drag and drop to re-arrange the charts within a section or to move a chart to a different section.

To add another chart to your dashboard, click the add icon (+) in the section header. When you've finished editing the dashboard, click the `Save` button to save your edits and exit.

To exit without saving your changes, click the `Cancel` button.
