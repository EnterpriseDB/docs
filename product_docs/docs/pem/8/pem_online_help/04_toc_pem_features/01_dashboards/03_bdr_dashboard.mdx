The `BDR Monitoring Dashboards` display the information about replication activities of the `BDR Nodes` in a `BDR Group`. There are three different dashboards for BDR:

-   BDR Admin Dashboard
-   BDR Group Monitoring Dashboard
-   BDR Node Monitoring Dashboard

To view the details on these dashboards, you must enable the probes on the BDR Nodes. By default, the [BDR Probes](../12_pem_manage_probes/03_pem_probe_config/01_pem_probes/#bdr_probes) are disabled. To enable the probes, highlight the name of the BDR Node in the PEM client browser tree control, and select `Manage Probes...` from the `Management` menu. Use the `Manage Probes..` tab to enable to Probes.

## BDR Admin Dashboard

To view the details on `BDR Admin Dashboard` enable the following probes:

-   BDR Group Camo Details
-   BDR Group Locks
-   BDR Group Raft Details
-   BDR Group Versions Details
-   BDR Node Summary
-   BDR Worker
-   BDR Worker Errors

Then highlight the `BDR Node` in the PEM client browser and select the `BDR Admin` from the `Dashboards` drop down menu.

This includes the time taken for the heavyweight session lock acquire, but does NOT include any time taken on DDL epochs or queue flushing. If the lock is re-acquired after local node restart, this will be the node restart time.

-   The `Is Camo Partner Ready?` column displays the readiness status of the camo partner.
-   The `Camo Transactions Resolved` column displays if there are any pending and unresolved CAMO transactions.
-   The `Apply LSN` column displays the latest position reported as replayed.
-   The `Receive LSN` column displays the latest LSN of any change or message received.
-   The `Apply Queue Size` column displays the difference between apply_lsn and receive_lsn in bytes.
