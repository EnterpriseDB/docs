SQL Profiler captures statistical information and query execution plans for SQL statements executed during a trace session. You can use the information stored by SQL Profiler to identify performance issues. Before using SQL Profiler, you must [install and configure SQL Profiler](01_sp_installing_sql_profiler/#sp_installing_sql_profiler) on each database you intend to profile.
