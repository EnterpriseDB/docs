    ```

2.  Use the following command to remove the PEM packages:

    yum erase edb-pem-server
    ```

3.  Use the following command to drop the `pem` database:

    DROP DATABASE pem
    ```

4.  Move the certificates from `/root/.pem/` to another location:

    mv /root/.pem/* <new_location>
    ```

    ```
