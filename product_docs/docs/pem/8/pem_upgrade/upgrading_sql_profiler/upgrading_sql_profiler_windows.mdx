title: "Upgrading a SQL Profiler installation on a Windows host"
---

If you are using SQL Profiler on a Windows host, Windows will lock any files that have been executed or loaded into memory. To release any locked files, you must stop the Postgres server before performing an upgrade.

On Windows, you can use the `Services` dialog to control the service. To open the `Services` dialog, navigate through the `Control Panel` to the `System and Security menu`. Select `Administrative Tools`, and then double-click the `Services` icon. When the `Services` dialog opens, highlight the service name in the list, and use the option provided on the dialog to `Stop` the service.

After stopping the Postgres Server:

1.  Delete the existing SQL Profiler query set on each node by invoking the `uninstall-sql-profiler.sql` script. By default, on a Windows host the script resides in the `share\contrib` directory under your Advanced Server or PostgreSQL installation.

    You can use the following server-specific commands.

    For PostgreSQL:

    ```text
    psql -f C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<x>\share\contrib\uninstall-sql-profiler.sql -d postgres -U postgres
    ```

    Where, `x` is the version of PostgreSQL and `-d` specifies the name of the maintenance database.

    For Advanced Server:

    ```text
    psql -f C:\Program Files\edb\as<x>\share\contrib\uninstall-sql-profiler.sql -d edb -U enterprisedb
    ```

    Where `x` is the version of Advanced Server and `-d` specifies the name of the maintenance database.

2.  Invoke the new SQL Profiler installer on each node you wish to profile; run the installer as `Administrator`.

    For PostgreSQL:

    ```text
    sqlprofiler-pg-<x>-<y>-windows-x64.exe
    ```

    Where, `x` is the version of the PostgreSQL and `y` is the version of SQL Profiler. For example: `sqlprofiler-pg-12-7.14.0-1-windows-x64.exe`.

    For Advanced Server:

    ```text
    sqlprofiler-edb-as<x>-<y>-windows-x64.exe
    ```

    Where `x` is the version of Advanced Server and `y` is the version of SQL Profiler. For example: `sqlprofiler-edb-as12-7.14.0-1-windows-x64.exe`.

    The SQL Profiler installer will detect the existing `SQL Profiler` installation and upgrade it with the latest version of SQL Profiler.

3.  Run the `sql-profiler.sql` script file in the maintenance database.

    For PostgreSQL:

    ```text
    psql -f C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<x>\share\contrib\sql-profiler.sql -d postgres -U postgres
    ```

    Where `x` is the version of PostgreSQL and `-d` specifies the name of the maintenance database.

    For Advanced Server:

    ```text
    psql -f C:\Program Files\edb\as<x>\share\contrib\sql-profiler.sql -d edb -U enterprisedb
    ```

    Where, `x` is the version of Advanced Server and `-d` specifies the name of the maintenance database.

4.  Then, restart the Postgres Server to resume profiling the node from a PEM client.
