    Monitoring Barman is available in PEM 8.4.0 and later.

Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) is designed to assist database administrators, system architects, and performance analysts when administering, monitoring, and tuning PostgreSQL and Advanced Server database servers.

Barman (Backup and Recovery Manager) is an open-source administration tool for remote backups and disaster recovery of PostgreSQL servers in business-critical environments. It relies on PostgreSQL’s Point In Time Recovery technology, allowing DBAs to remotely manage a complete catalogue of backups and the recovery phase of multiple remote servers – all from one location. For more information about Barman, see [Barman docs](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/supported-open-source/barman/).

Starting with version 8.4, you can monitor a Barman server through PEM console. You can monitor your Barman server using the PEM console.

Before you manage a Barman server through PEM console, your system must meet certain requirements. See 

-   [Prerequisites for monitoring Barman](01_managing_barman_prerequisites)

You must add a Barman server to the PEM console whose backup you want to manage with Barman. See

-   [Configuring a Barman Server](02_configuring_barman_server)

After you configure the Barman server, you will be able to view the details of the backups in the dashboard. See
