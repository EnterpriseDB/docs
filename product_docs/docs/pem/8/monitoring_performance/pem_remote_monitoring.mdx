Remote monitoring is monitoring your Postgres cluster using a PEM Agent residing on a different host.

To remotely monitor a Postgres cluster with PEM, you must register the cluster with PEM, and bind a PEM agent. See [Registering a Server](02_registering_server/#registering_server) for more information.

The following scenarios require remote monitoring using PEM:

- [Postgres cluster running on AWS RDS](../pem_admin/03_pem_define_aws_instance_connection/#monitoring-a-postgres-instance-running-on-aws-ec2S)
- [Postgres cluster running on BigAnimal](../../../biganimal/latest/using_cluster/05_monitoring_and_logging/)

PEM remote monitoring supports:
