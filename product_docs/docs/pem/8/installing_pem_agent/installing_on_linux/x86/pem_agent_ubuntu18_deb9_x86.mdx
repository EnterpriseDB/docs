To install PEM on a Debian or Ubuntu host, you must have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, [contact EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request) .

The following steps will walk you through using the EDB apt repository to install a Debian package. When using the commands, replace the username and password with the credentials provided by EDB.

1.  Log in as root:

    ```text
    sudo su -
    ```

2.  Configure the EDB repository:


    ```text
    sh -c 'echo "deb https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com $(lsb_release - cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
    ```

Where `username:password` is to be replaced by the credentials provided by EDB.

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

    ```text
    apt-get install apt-transport-https
    ```

4.  Add the EBD signing key:

    ```text
    wget -q -O -https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add â€“
    ```

5.  Update the repository metadata:

    ```text
    apt-get update
    ```

6.  Use the following command to install the Debian package for the PEM Agent:

    ```text
    apt-get install edb-pem-agent
    ```

After installing PEM Agent using `apt-get`, you need to register the PEM Agent. For more detailed information see [Registering an agent](../../../registering_agent).
