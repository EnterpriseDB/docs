!!! Note

    Postgres Enterprise Manager 8.3 and later is supported on SLES.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Address other prerequisites

  ```shell
  # Activate the required SUSE module
  # You can use SLES 15 SP3 for PEM 8.3 and later:
  sudo SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.3/x86_64

  # You can use SLES 15 SP4 for PEM 8.6 and later:
  sudo SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.4/x86_64

  # Refresh the metadata
  sudo zypper refresh
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo zypper -n install edb-pem-agent
```

After installing PEM agent, you need to register the PEM agent. For detailed information see [Registering an agent](/pem/latest/registering_agent/).
