title: Installing Postgres Enterprise Manager agent on SLES 15 ppc64le
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Address other prerequisites

  ```shell
  # Activate the required SUSE module
  SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.3/ppc64le

  # Refresh the metadata
  sudo zypper refresh
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo zypper -n install edb-pem-agent
```

After installing PEM agent, you need to register the PEM agent. For detailed information see [Registering an agent](/pem/latest/registering_agent/).
