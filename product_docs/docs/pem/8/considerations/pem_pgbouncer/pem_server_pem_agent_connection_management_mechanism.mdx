Each PEM agent connects to the PEM database server using the SSL certificates for each user. For example, an agent with `ID#1` connects to the PEM database server using the agent1 user.

![Connecting to the PEM database without pgBouncer](../../images/pem_database_without_pgbouncer.png)

Prior to PEM version 7.5, the following limitations disallowed the use of the connection pooler between the PEM server and PEM agent:

-   The PEM agent uses an SSL certificate to connect to the PEM database server.
-   It uses an individual user identifier when connecting to the PEM database server.

EDB modified the PEM agent to allow the agent to use a common database user (instead of the dedicated agent users) to connect to the PEM database server.

![Connecting to pgBouncer.](../../images/pem_database_with_pgbouncer.png)

We recommend using PgBouncer version 1.9.0 or later as the connection pooler. Versions 1.9.0 or later support cert authentication. PEM agents can connect to pgBouncer using SSL certificates.
