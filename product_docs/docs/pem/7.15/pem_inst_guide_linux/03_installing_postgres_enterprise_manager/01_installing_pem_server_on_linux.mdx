Before following the detailed instructions that install the PEM server on your specific platform, you must perform the prerequisite steps detailed in Section 3.1.1.



## Prerequisites for installing the PEM Server on Linux Platforms

1.  Install a backing database.
    
    When installing a PEM server on a Linux host, you must first install a backing database cluster which will hold the `pem` database. The PEM server’s backing database may be installed via package for Linux. The backing database must be one of the following versions:
    
      - EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 9.5 or above
      - PostgreSQL version 9.5 or above
    
    For detailed information about installing an Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database, please see the product documentation at the EnterpriseDB website.

2.  Configure Postgres authentication on the backing database.
    
    The `pg_hba.conf` file on the backing database can be configured to use any supported authentication methods (for example: md5, trust,...) for connections. For information about modifying the `pg_hba.conf` file, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

3.  Install the `hstore` contrib module (PostgreSQL users only).
    
      - If you are using a PostgreSQL database, use the following command to install the `hstore contrib module`:
        
        ``` text
        yum install postgresql<x>-contrib
        ```
    
    Where, `x` is the server version.

4.  Ensure that the `sslutils` extension is installed.
    
      - On an Advanced Server backing database, the `sslutils` extension is installed by default.
    
      - If you are using a PostgreSQL backing database, ensure you have access to the PostgreSQL community repository, and use the command:
        
        ``` text
        yum install sslutils_<x>
        ```
    
    Where, `x` is the server version.

5.  Adjust your firewall restrictions.
    
    If you are using a firewall, you must allow access to port `8443` on the PEM backing database:
    
    ``` text
    firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8443/tcp
    
    firewall-cmd --reload
    ```

6.  Request credentials that allow you to access the EnterpriseDB repositories:
    
    To install the PEM Server, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, contact [EnterpriseDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request) . When using commands in the sections that follow, replace the `username` and `password` placeholders with the credentials provided by EnterpriseDB.

### Installing PEM-HTTPD

During the PEM server installation, you can specify your hosting preferences for the PEM-HTTPD server:

**To install the PEM Server and PEM-HTTPD on the same host**

Follow the installation steps; while running the configuration script, select the `Web Services and Database` option.

**To install the PEM Server and PEM-HTTPD on separate hosts**

Follow the installation steps on both the hosts. While running the configuration script, first configure PEM Server host by selecting the `Database` option on first host and then configure PEM-HTTPD host by selecting the `Web Services` option on the second host.

> For detailed information regarding Configuration of the PEM Server, see [Configuring the PEM Server on Linux Platforms](../../../7.15/pem_inst_guide_linux/03_installing_postgres_enterprise_manager/#configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux).

## Installing the PEM Server on a CentOS or RHEL Host

In addition to the above considerations, the following prerequisites are applicable if you are using a CentOS or RHEL 6.x, 7.x or 8.x host:

1.  Install the epel-release package and prepare the host.
    1.  You must install the `epel-release` package on the host by running one of the following commands:
        
        ``` text
        yum install epel-release
        
        yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
        ```
        
        <div class="note">
        
        <div class="title">
        
        Note
        
        </div>
        
        You may need to enable the `[extras]` repository definition in the `CentOS-Base.repo` file (located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`).
        
        If you are a Red Hat Network user:
        
          - You must also enable the `rhel-<x>-server-optional-rpms` repository to use EPEL packages, where *x* specifies the version of RHEL on the host. You can make the repository accessible by enabling the `RHEL optional subchannel` for `RHN-Classic`. If you have a certificate-based subscription, then you must also enable `rhel-<x>-server-eus-optional-rpms` repository to use EPEL packages or please see the `Red Hat Subscription Management Guide` for the required repository.
          - You must also enable the `rhel-<x>-server-extras-rpms` repository, where `x` specifies the version of the RHEL on the host.
        
        </div>
    
    2.  If you are using a `CentOS 6.x` or `RHEL 6.x` host, you need to stop the default `httpd` server and run commands to install `rh-python36` before installing the PEM server. As part of PEM server installation, an `httpd24` server will be installed.
        
          - Stop the default `httpd` server using the command:
            
            ``` text
            service httpd stop
            ```
        
          - Run the following commands to install `rh-python36`:
            
            ``` text
            yum install centos-release-scl
            ```
2.  Install and configure the `edb.repo` file.
    1.  To create a repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:
        
        ``` text
        yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
        ```
        
        The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.
    
    2.  After creating the `edb.repo` file, invoke the following command to replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user:
        
        ``` text
        sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
        ```
3.  Install the PEM Server.

>   - You can use `yum` to install the PEM server on CentOS or RHEL 6.x, 7.x or 8.x:
>     
>     ``` text
>     yum install edb-pem
>     ```
> 
>   - You can use `dnf` to install PEM Server on CentOS or RHEL 8.x:
>     
>     ``` text
>     dnf install edb-pem
>     ```

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

If you want to install PEM server on a machine that is in isolated network, you must first create PEM repository on that machine. For more information about creating PEM repository on an isolated network, see [Creating a PEM repository in an Isolated Network](../../../7.15/pem_inst_guide_linux/03_installing_postgres_enterprise_manager/#creating_pem_repo_isolated_network).

After installing PEM Server using `yum` or `dnf`, you need to configure the PEM Server. For more detailed information see [Configuring the PEM Server on Linux platforms](../../../7.15/pem_inst_guide_linux/03_installing_postgres_enterprise_manager/#configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux).

## Installing the PEM Server on a Debian or Ubuntu Host

The following steps will walk you through using the EnterpriseDB `apt` repository to install a Debian package.

You can also visit <https://repos.enterprisedb.com/> and select the platform and product to view the steps for installation.

</div>

1.  Log in as root on your Debian or Ubuntu host:
    
    ``` text
    sudo su -
    ```

2.  Configure the EnterpriseDB repository:
    
    ``` text
    sh -c 'echo "deb https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com $(lsb_release - cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
    ```
    
    Where `username:password` is to be replaced by the credentials provided by EnterpriseDB.

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:
    
    ``` text
    apt-get install apt-transport-https
    ```

4.  Add the EBD signing key:
    
    ``` text
    wget -q -O -https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add –``
    ```

5.  Update the repository metadata:
    
    ``` text
    apt-get update
    ```

6.  Use the following command to install the Debian package for the PEM server:
    
    ``` text
    apt-get install edb-pem
    ```

When the installation completes, you must configure the PEM Server. For detailed information see [Configuring the PEM Server on Linux Platforms](../../../7.15/pem_inst_guide_linux/03_installing_postgres_enterprise_manager/#configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux).

## Installing the PEM Server on a SLES Host

Use the following command to add the EnterpriseDB repository configuration files to your SLES host:

> 
> 
> ``` text
> zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo
> ```

The command creates a repository configuration file named `edb.repo` in the `/etc/zypp/repos.d` directory. Modify the repository configuration file, adding the username and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

Before installing PEM, you must install prerequisite packages. Invoke the following commands, replacing *sp_no* with the service pack that you are using (i.e. SP4):

> 
> 
> ``` text
> SUSEConnect -p sle-module-legacy/12/x86_64
> 
> SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12/x86_64
> 
> zypper addrepo  https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache:Modules/SLE_12_<sp_no>/Apache:Modules.repo
> 
> zypper addrepo http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Cloud:/OpenStack:/Newton:/cisco-apic:/2.3.1/SLE_12_<sp_no>/ pem_opensuse_boost
> ```

Then, refresh the repository and install the PEM server:

> 
> 
> ``` text
> zypper refresh
> 
> zypper install edb-pem
> ```

After installing PEM Server using `zypper`, you must configure the PEM Server. For detailed information see [Configuring the PEM Server on Linux Platforms](../../../7.15/pem_inst_guide_linux/03_installing_postgres_enterprise_manager/#configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux).
