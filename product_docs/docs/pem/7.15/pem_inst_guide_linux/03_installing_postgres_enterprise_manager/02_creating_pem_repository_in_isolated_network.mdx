You can create a local repository to act as a host for RPM packages if the server on which you wish to install PEM cannot directly access the EnterpriseDB repository. Please note that this is a high-level overview of the steps required; you may need to modify the process for your individual network. To create and use a local repository, you must:

1.  Use a system with Internet access to download all of the required dependencies:

> 
> 
> ``` text
> yum install yum-plugin-downloadonly
> 
> mkdir /<pem_dir>
> 
> yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=/<pem_dir>/ edb-pem
> 
> mkdir /<epel_dir>
> 
> yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=/<epel_dir>/ epel-release*
> ```
> 
> Where `<pem_dir>` and `<epel_dir>` are the local directories that you create for downloading the RPMs.

2.  Copy the `/<pem_dir>` and `/<epel_dir>` directories to a machine on the isolated network.

3.  Create the repositories:
    
    ``` text
    yum install createrepo
    
    createrepo /<pem_dir>
    
    createrepo /<epel_dir>
    ```

4.  Create a repository configuration file called `/etc/yum.repos.d/pem.repo` with connection information that specifies:

> 
> 
> ``` text
> [pemrepo]
> name=PEM Repository
> baseurl=file:///<pem_dir>/
> enabled=1
> gpgcheck=0
> ```

6.  Create a repository configuration file called `/etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo` with connection information that specifies:

> 
> 
> ``` text
> [epelrepo]
> name=epel Repository
> baseurl=file:///<epel_dir>/
> enabled=1
> gpgcheck=0
> ```

After specifying the location and connection information for your local repository, you can use yum commands to install or upgrade the PEM server:

>   - To install a PEM server:
>     
>     ``` text
>     yum install edb-pem
>     ```
> 
>   - To upgrade a PEM server:
>     
>     ``` text
>     yum upgrade edb-pem
>     ```
