A PEM Agent may monitor one or more servers on one or more hosts. For comprehensive information about managing a PEM Agent, see the [PEM Agent User Guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/p/edb-postgres-enterprise-manager).

## Installing a PEM Agent on a CentOS or RHEL host

On a CentOS or RHEL system, you can use the `yum` package manager or `dnf` command to install a PEM Agent depending on the version of the operating system.

The following prerequisites are applicable if you are using a CentOS or RHEL 6.x, 7.x or 8.x host:

1.  **Install epel-release package**
    1.  You must install the `epel-release` package on the host by running any one of the following commands:

        ``` text
        yum install epel-release

        yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-<X>.noarch.rpm
        ```

        Where `X` is the OS version.

        <div class="title">

        Note

        </div>

        You may need to enable the `[extras]` repository definition in the `CentOS-Base.repo` file (located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`).

        If you are a Red Hat Network user,

          - You must also enable the `rhel-<x>-server-optional-rpms` repository to use EPEL packages, where *x* specifies the version of RHEL on the host. You can make the repository accessible by enabling the `RHEL optional subchannel` for `RHN-Classic`. If you have a certificate-based subscription, then you must also enable `rhel-<x>-server-eus-optional-rpms` repository to use EPEL packages or please see the `Red Hat Subscription Management Guide` for the required repository.
          - You must also enable the `rhel-<x>-server-extras-rpms` repository, where `x` specifies the version of the RHEL on the host.

        </div>
2.  **Install and configure edb.repo**
    1.  You must also have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials, visit:

        [EnterpriseDB Repository Access Steps](https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339//../../../../../../../../images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf).

    2.  Create a repository configuration file; assume superuser privileges, and invoke the following command:

        ``` text
        yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
        ```

        The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

    3.  After creating the `edb.repo` file, to ensure that the value of the enabled parameter is `1`, and the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification are replaced with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user, run the following command:.

        ``` text
        sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
        ```

If you want to install PEM Agent on a machine that is in isolated network, you must first create PEM repository on that machine. For more information about creating PEM repository on an isolated network, see [Creating a PEM repository in an Isolated Network](../../../7.15/pem_inst_guide_linux/03_installing_postgres_enterprise_manager/#creating_pem_repo_isolated_network).

**Installing the PEM Agent**

>   - Use the `yum install` command to install PEM Agent on CentOS or RHEL 6.x, 7.x or 8.x:
>
>     ``` text
>     yum install edb-pem-agent
>     ```
>
>   - Also, you can use `dnf` command to install PEM Agent on CentOS or RHEL 8.x:
>
>     ``` text
>     dnf install edb-pem-agent
>     ```

When the installation is complete, it will display a list of the installed packages and dependencies.

![*Using an RPM package to install the PEM Agent*](../images/pem_rpm_installation_agent.png)

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

After installing PEM Agent using `yum` or `dnf`, you need to register the PEM Agent. For more detailed information see [Registering a PEM Agent](../../../7.15/pem_inst_guide_linux/03_installing_postgres_enterprise_manager/#registering_a_pem_agent).

## Installing a PEM Agent on a Debian or Ubuntu Host

To install PEM on a Debian or Ubuntu host, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, [contact EnterpriseDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request) .

The following steps will walk you through using the EnterpriseDB apt repository to install a Debian package. When using the commands, replace the username and password with the credentials provided by EnterpriseDB.

1.  Log in as root:

    ``` text
    sudo su -
    ```

2.  Configure the EnterpriseDB repository:

    ``` text
    sh -c 'echo "deb https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release - cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
    ```

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

    ``` text
    apt-get install apt-transport-https
    ```

4.  Add the EBD signing key:

    ``` text
    wget -q -O -https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add â€“
    ```

5.  Update the repository metadata:

    ``` text
    apt-get update
    ```

6.  Use the following command to install the Debian package for the PEM Agent:

    ``` text
    apt-get install edb-pem-agent
    ```

After installing PEM Agent using `apt-get`, you need to register the PEM Agent. For more detailed information see [Registering a PEM Agent](../../../7.15/pem_inst_guide_linux/03_installing_postgres_enterprise_manager/#registering_a_pem_agent).

## Installing a PEM Agent on a SLES Host



Use the following command to add the EnterpriseDB repository configuration files to your SLES host:

>
>
> ``` text
> zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo
> ```

The command creates a repository configuration file named `edb.repo` in the `/etc/zypp/repos.d` directory. Modify the repository configuration file, adding the username and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

Before installing PEM, you must install prerequisite packages. Use the following commands replacing *sp_no* with the service pack that you are using (i.e. SP2 or SP3):

>
>
> ``` text
> SUSEConnect -p sle-module-legacy/12/x86_64
>
> SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12/x86_64
>
> zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache:Modules/SLE_12_<sp_no>/Apache:Modules.repo
>
> zypper addrepo http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Cloud:/OpenStack:/Newton:/cisco-apic:/2.3.1/SLE_12_<sp_no>/ pem_opensuse_boost
> ```

Then, you can refresh the repository and add a PEM agent:

>
>
> ``` text
> zypper refresh
>
> zypper install edb-pem-agent
> ```

After installing the PEM Agent, you must register the agent. For more detailed information see [Registering a PEM Agent](../../../7.15/pem_inst_guide_linux/03_installing_postgres_enterprise_manager/#registering_a_pem_agent).
