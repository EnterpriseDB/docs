-   A service script allows the PEM server to start, stop or restart the server if necessary when performing configuration management, certificate management, or other administrative tasks.

-   The Postgres server on which the PEM server resides must contain a service script. Postgres installers in Windows generated by EnterpriseDB create a service script for you; if you are using a Postgres server from another source like native packages, you must provide a service script.

    > On **CentOS or RHEL 6.x**, the service script resides in the `/etc/init.d` directory.
    >
    > On **CentOS or RHEL 7.x or 8.x**, the service script resides in the `/usr/lib/systemd/system` directory.

-   Service scripts are platform-specific.
