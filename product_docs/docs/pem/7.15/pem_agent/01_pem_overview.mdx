## PEM Architecture







Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) consists of components that provide management and analytical functionality:

  - **PEM Server**: The PEM server is used as the data repository for monitoring data and as a server to which both agents and clients connect. The PEM server consists of an instance of PostgreSQL, an associated database for storage of monitoring data, and a server that provides web services.
  - **PEM web interface**: The PEM web interface allows you to manage and monitor Postgres servers and utilize PEM extended functionality. The web interface software is installed with the PEM server installer, and is accessed via your choice of web browser.
  - **PEM Agent**: The PEM agent is responsible for executing tasks and reporting statistics from the agent host and monitored Postgres instances to the PEM server. A single PEM agent can monitor multiple installed instances of Postgres that reside on one or many hosts.
  - **SQL Profiler plugin**: This plugin to the Postgres server is used to generate the monitoring data used by the SQL Profiler tool. Installation of the SQL Profiler plugin is optional, but the plugin must be installed on each instance of Postgres you wish to profile. The SQL Profiler may be used with any supported version of an EnterpriseDB distribution of a PostgreSQL server or an Advanced Server (not just those managed through the PEM server).

The PEM Agent installer creates two executables: the PEM worker (`pemworker.exe`) and the PEM agent (`pemagent.exe`). Each PEM worker has a corresponding PEM agent that you can use to start or stop the PEM worker. The PEM agent will also restart the PEM worker should it terminate unexpectedly. The PEM worker log file contains information related to PEM worker activity (probe activities, heartbeat responses, etc.), and is stored in `/var/log/pem/worker.log`.

The architectural diagram below illustrates the relationship between the various servers and workstations involved in a typical PEM installation.
