At the heart of each PEM installation is the server. In a production environment, the server will typically be a dedicated machine, monitoring a large number of Postgres servers or a smaller number of busy servers.

The PEM server backend database may be an EnterpriseDB distribution of the PostgreSQL or Advanced Server database server, or an existing Postgres server installed from another source. The Postgres backing database server must be version 9.4 or later, and will contain a database named `pem`, which is used by the PEM server as a repository.

-   If you would like to use an existing Postgres server to host the PEM server, the PEM server installer can create the `pem` database on the Postgres host. You must manually satisfy the software pre-requisites if you choose to use an existing server.

    For more information about using an existing Postgres server to host the PEM server backend database, see [Installing the PEM Server on an Existing Postgres Server](../03_installing_postgres_enterprise_manager/#installing_the_pem_server_on_an_existing_postgres_server) section.

-   If you do not wish to use an existing installation of Postgres as the PEM server host, the PEM server installer can install PostgreSQL, satisfy the server host's software pre-requisites, and create an instance (a PostgreSQL database cluster) that contains the `pem` database.

    This is the simplest PEM server installation option.

PEM-HTTPD is made available for Postgres installations through the PEM server installer or the StackBuilder utility. If PEM-HTTPD is already installed on the host, the PEM server installer will review and update the existing installation if required. If the PEM server host does not contain an existing PEM-HTTPD installation, the PEM server installer will add it.

Before installing the PEM server, you must decide if you wish to run PostgreSQL and PEM-HTTPD on the same host or on separate hosts. If you intend to run the PostgreSQL database server and PEM-HTTPD on different hosts, then you must run the PEM server installer twice – once on each host, as detailed in [Installing the PEM Server and PEM-HTTPD on Separate Hosts](../03_installing_postgres_enterprise_manager/#installing_the_pem_server_and_pem-httpd_on_separate_hosts) section.

The PEM server installer will also install the software required to access the server via the PEM web interface. You can access the web interface with a supported version of your browser of choice.

![*The PEM web interface*](../images/pem_web_interface.png)

You can use the web interface to review information about objects that reside on monitored servers, manage databases and database objects that reside on monitored servers, or review statistical information gathered by the PEM server.



## Installing the PEM Server and PEM-HTTPD on the Same Host

The easiest PEM server installation configuration consists of a PEM backend database server (hosted on a PostgreSQL database installed with the PEM server installer) and a PEM-HTTPD service that reside on the same host. In this configuration, the PEM server installer will provide the pre-requisite software for the backend host register the service (on Windows).

To invoke the PEM server installer on a Windows system, right click the installer icon and select `Run as Administrator`. The installer displays a `Welcome` dialog.

![*PEM Server Wizard - Welcome dialog*](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_welcome_wizard.png)

Click `Next` to continue to the `License Agreement` dialog.

![*PEM Server Wizard - License Agreement dialog*](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_license_agreement.png)

Carefully review the license agreement before highlighting the appropriate radio button and accepting the agreement. Click `Next` to continue to the `Installation Directory` dialog.

![*PEM Server Wizard - Installation directory dialog*](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_installation_directory.png)

Use the `Installation Directory` dialog to specify the location of the PEM server:

-   By default, the PEM server is installed in `C:\Program Files\edb\pem` on Windows. Accept the default location, or use the `Installation Directory` button to open a browser dialog and select the directory in which the PEM server will be installed.
-   Use the `Show advanced options` check box to instruct the installer to open the `Advanced options` dialog.
-   Use the `Advanced options` dialog when installing the Postgres database server and the PEM-HTTPD on different hosts, or if you wish the PEM server to reside on an existing Postgres server installation.

To install the PostgreSQL server packaged with the installer and PEM-HTTPD on the same host, leave the `Show advanced options` box unchecked and click `Next`.

The PEM server installer will perform a pre-installation check for PEM-HTTPD, Language Pack, and PostgreSQL 10. If the installer does not locate these packages, it will inform you in the `Dependency missing` dialog.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

By default EDB Language Pack is installed in `C:\edb\languagepack\v1`.

</div>

![*PEM Server Wizard - Dependencies check dialog*](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_prerequisites_checks.png)

If the dependencies are missing, the PEM server installer will launch the respective installation wizards; follow the onscreen directions presented by the installation wizards for each package.

After installing any missing dependencies, the installation process continues by displaying the `Database Server Installation Details` dialog.

![*PEM Server Wizard - Database Server Installation details dialog*](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_pgsql_credentials.png)

The information provided on the `Database Server Installation Details` dialog enables the installer to connect to the PostgreSQL server. Provide the `User name` and `Password` of a database superuser. After supplying the requested information, click `Next` to continue to the `pemAgent Service Account` dialog.

![*PEM Server Wizard - pemAgent Service Account Password dialog*](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_pemagent_service_account_password.png)

After providing the name and password of the Postgres database superuser, you may be prompted for the password to the user account under which the PEM agent will run. If prompted, provide the password, and press `Next` to continue to the `Network Details` dialog.

![*Supply the network address from which the agent will connect*](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_network_details.png)

Use the `Network Details` dialog to specify the CIDR-style network address from which the PEM agents will connect to the server (the *client-side* address).

You may specify the address of a network host, or a network address range. For example, if you wish to monitor database servers with the addresses `192.168.10.23`, `192.168.10.76` and `192.168.10.184`, enter `192.168.10.0/24` to allow connections with hosts in that network.

The specified address will be added to the server's `pg_hba.conf` file. You can specify additional network addresses by manually adding entries to the `pg_hba.conf` file on the PostgreSQL server if required, using the initial entry as a template.

When you've added the `Network address`, click `Next` to continue to the `Agent Details` dialog.

The PEM server installer will install a PEM agent on the host on which the server resides, to monitor the server and provide alert processing and garbage collection services. A certificate will also be installed in the location specified in the `Agent certificate path` field.

![*PEM Server Wizard - Agent Description and Certificate Path dialog*](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_agent_details.png)

Enter an alternate description or select an alternate agent certificate path for the PEM agent, or accept the defaults. Click `Next` to continue to the `Ready to Install` dialog.

![*PEM Server Wizard - Ready to Install dialog*](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_installation_begins.png)

The wizard is now ready to install the PEM server.

Click `Back` to modify any of the options previously selected, or `Next` to continue with the installation.

![*PEM Server Wizard - Installation in progress*](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_installation_in_progress.png)

During the installation process, the installer will copy files to the system, and set up the database and web services required to run PEM. When the installation completes, a popup dialog opens confirming that the webservice has been configured, and is listening on port `8443`, and that the `pem` database has been created and configured.

![*PEM Server Wizard - pem database created*](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_db_pem_created.png)

Click `OK` to acknowledge that the webservice has been configured, and that the `pem` database has been created, and continue to the `Completed`… dialog.

![*PEM server Wizard - Installation Finish dialog*](../images/pem_server_on_same_host_installation_complete.png)

## Installing the PEM Server and PEM-HTTPD on Separate Hosts



To use separate hosts for the PEM server backend database and PEM-HTTPD, you must:

1.  Invoke the PEM server installer on the host of the Postgres server that will contain the `pem` database. During the installation, select the `Database` option on the `Advanced options` dialog, and provide connection information for the Postgres server.
2.  Modify the `pg_hba.conf` file of the Postgres installation on which the PEM server (and `pem` database) resides, allowing connections from the host of the PEM-HTTPD server.
3.  Invoke the PEM server installer on the host of the PEM-HTTPD server, selecting the `Web Services` option on the `Installation Type` dialog.

To invoke the PEM server installer on a Windows system, right click the installer icon and select `Run as Administrator`. The installer displays a `Welcome` dialog.

![*PEM Server Wizard - Welcome dialog*](../images/pem_server_on_separate_host_welcome_wizard.png)

Click `Next` to continue to the `License Agreement` dialog.

![*PEM Server Wizard - License Agreement dialog*](../images/pem_server_on_separate_host_license_agreement.png)

Carefully review the license agreement before highlighting the appropriate radio button and accepting the agreement; click `Next` to continue.

![*PEM Server Wizard - Installation Directory dialog*](../images/pem_server_on_separate_host_installation_directory.png)

Use fields on the `Installation Directory` dialog to specify the directory in which the PEM server will reside, and to access the `Advanced options` dialog:

-   By default, the PEM server is installed in the `C:\Program Files\edb\pem` on Windows. Accept the default location, or use the `Installation Directory` field to open a browser dialog and select the directory in which the PEM server will be installed.
-   To install the PEM server and PEM-HTTPD on separate hosts, you must use the `Advanced options` dialog to specify the installation type (`Web Services` or `Database`). Select the `Show advanced options` check box to instruct the installer to include the `Advanced options` dialog in the installation process.

Click `Next` to continue to the `Advanced Options` dialog.

![*PEM Server Wizard - Advanced Options dialog*](../images/pem_server_on_separate_host_web_services_and_database.png)

Use the radio buttons on the `Advanced options` dialog to specify the component or components that you would like to install:

-   Select `Web Services and Database` to indicate that the Postgres server and PEM-HTTPD will both reside on the current host. If you select the `Web Services and Database` option, the PEM server installer will allow you to specify which Postgres server you wish to use for the PEM server before checking for a PEM-HTTPD installation.
-   Select `Web Services` to install PEM-HTTPD on the current host, while using a Postgres database server that resides on another host to host the PEM server and `pem` database.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

</div>

You may be required to add the `sslutils` package to your installation.

</div>

-   Select the `PostgreSQL x` option to install the Postgres server that is distributed with the PEM server installer where `x` is the PostgreSQL database server version. If you decide to use the version of PostgreSQL that is bundled with the PEM server installer, the EnterpriseDB one-click PostgreSQL installer will open and walk you through the installation.
-   Select `Other Database Server` to specify connection information for a Postgres server that was not installed using a one-click graphical installer from EnterpriseDB. For information about the software pre-requisites for the PEM server database host, please see [Preparing the Postgres Server](../03_installing_postgres_enterprise_manager/#preparing_the_postgres_server) section.

Click `Next` to continue.

If the PEM server will reside on an existing Postgres server, the `Database Server Installation Details` dialog shown in opens.

![*PEM Server Wizard - Database Server Installation Details dialog*](../images/pem_server_on_separate_host_database_server_installation_details.png)

The information required on the `Database Server Installation Details` dialog may vary; the PEM server installer will ask you to provide only the information about the selected installation that it cannot locate:

-   Specify the name of a Postgres database superuser in the `User` field.
-   Specify the password associated with that user in the `Password` field.

Click `Next` to continue.

If prompted, provide the system password for the service account under which the PEM agent will run.

-   Enter the name of a Postgres database superuser in the `User` field.
-   Enter the password associated with the Postgres superuser in the `Password` field.

Click `Next` to continue. Before completing the PEM server installation, the installer will contact the database host. The `pg_hba.conf` file on the PEM database host must be configured to accept connections from the host of the httpd server and the firewall must allow a connection for the installation to continue. The PEM server installer will complete the PEM server installation, adding only those items that must reside on the host of the PEM-HTTPD server.

<div id="installing_the_pem_server_on_an_existing_postgres_server" class="registered_link"></div>

## Installing the PEM Server on an Existing Postgres Server



You can use an existing Postgres server (version 9.4 or later) to host the PEM server and the `pem` database. Postgres installers and pre-requisite software extensions are freely available on the [EnterpriseDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads).

This section provides information about configuring an existing Postgres server for a PEM server installation.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

The steps that follow should be considered guidelines only; the actual steps required to configure your Postgres installation will vary depending on the configuration of your Postgres server.

</div>

The following versions of Postgres are pre-configured to contain the `sslutils` extension and a service script; no additional preparation is required to use the following Postgres versions as a PEM backend database server:

-   PostgreSQL 9.4 or later (as bundled with the PEM Server installer)
-   Advanced Server 9.4 or later

<div id="preparing_the_postgres_server" class="registered_link"></div>

### Preparing the Postgres Server

Before installing the PEM server on an existing Postgres server, you must:

-   Ensure that the Postgres server contains an installation of the `sslutils` extension. For more information, see [Installing the sslutils Extension](../03_installing_postgres_enterprise_manager/#installing_the_sslutils_extension) section.
-   Register the server with the Windows service manager. For more information, see the [Registering the Service](../03_installing_postgres_enterprise_manager/#registering_the_service) section.

After preparing the server, you can use the PEM server installer to install PEM on the existing Postgres server.

<div id="installing_the_sslutils_extension" class="registered_link"></div>

### Installing the sslutils Extension



The Postgres server on which the PEM server will reside must contain the `sslutils` extension. The `sslutils` package is freely available for download from the [EnterpriseDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/modified-gpl-source-code)

When the web page opens, select the link for the `SRC- SSL Utils 1.3` package. When the download completes, extract the file, and copy it into the Postgres installation directory.



Remember: You are *not* required to manually add the `sslutils` extension when using the following Postgres installations:

-   PostgreSQL 9.4 or later (as distributed with the PEM server installer)
-   Advanced Server 9.4 or later

`sslutils` must be built with the same compiler that was used to compile the backend Postgres installation. If you are using a backend Postgres database that was installed on a Windows platform using a PostgreSQL one-click installer (from EnterpriseDB) or an Advanced Server installer, you must use Visual Studio to build `sslutils`.

While specific details of the installation process will vary by platform and compiler, the basic steps are the same. You must:

1.  Copy the `sslutils` package to the Postgres installation directory.

2.  Open the command line of the appropriate compiler, and navigate into the `sslutils` directory.

3.  Use the following commands to build `sslutils`:

    > `SET USE_PGXS=1`
    >
    > `SET GETTEXTPATH=<path_to_gettext>`
    >
    > `SET OPENSSLPATH=<path_to_openssl>`
    >
    > `SET PGPATH=<path_to_pg_installation_dir>`
    >
    > `SET ARCH=x86`
    >
    > `REM Set ARCH x64 for 64 bit`
    >
    > `msbuild sslutils.proj /p:Configuration=Release`
    >
    > Where:
    >
    > `path_to_gettext` specifies the location of the `GETTEXT` library and header files.
    >
    > `path_to_openssl` specifies the location of the `openssl` library and header files.
    >
    > `path_to_pg_installation_dir` specifies the location of the Postgres installation.

4.  Copy the compiled `sslutils` files to the appropriate directory for your installation. The `sslutils` directory will contain the following files:

    > `sslutils--1.3.sql`
    >
    > `sslutils--unpackaged--1.3.sql`
    >
    > `sslutils--pemagent.sql.in`
    >
    > `sslutils.dll`

    Copy the `.dll` libraries and `.sql` files into place:

    > `COPY sslutils*.sql* "%PGPATH%\share\extension\"`
    >
    > `COPY sslutils.dll "%PGPATH%\lib\"`

<div id="registering_the_service" class="registered_link"></div>

### Registering the Service



When you install a PostgreSQL or an Advanced Server database using an installer from EnterpriseDB, the installer will register the service for you.

If you are using Windows to host the PEM backend database, you must register the name of the Postgres server with the Windows service manager. If you are using a Postgres server that was created using an EnterpriseDB installer, the service will be registered automatically. If you are manually building the installation, you can use the `register` clause of the Postgres `pg_ctl` command to register the service. The syntax of the command is:

> `pg_ctl register [-N <service_name>] [-U <user_name>] | [-P <password>] [-D <data_directory>]`
>
> Where:
>
> `service name` specifies the name of the Postgres cluster.
>
> `user_name` specifies the name of an operating system user with sufficient privileges to access the Postgres installation directory and start the Postgres service.
>
> `password` specifies the operating system password associated with the user.
>
> `data_directory` specifies the location of the Postgres data directory.

For more information about using the `pg_ctl` command and the available command options, see the

> [Postgres core documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-pg-ctl.html)

### Invoking the PEM Server Installer



After preparing the existing Postgres server, invoke the PEM server installer. Assume Administrative privileges and navigate into the directory that contains the installer. Then, invoke the installer with the command:

> `pem_server-7.<x>.<x>-<x>-<platform>`

Where *x* is the major and minor versions of PEM and platform is the platform.

If you are using a PEM-HTTPD service that resides on a separate host, you must:

-   Modify the `pg_hba.conf` file on the Postgres server host to allow connections between the hosts.
-   Invoke the PEM server installer on the host of the PEM-HTTPD server. See [Installing Web Services](../03_installing_postgres_enterprise_manager/#installing_web_services) section for more information about installing PEM-HTTPD.

## Invoking the Server Installer from Command Line



The command line options of the PEM server and PEM agent installers offer functionality in situations where a graphical installation may not work because of limited resources or system configuration. You can:

-   Include the `--mode unattended` option when invoking the installer to perform an installation without additional user input.

Not all command line options are suitable for all platforms. For a complete reference guide to the command line options, include the `--help` option when you invoke the installer.

### Invoking the PEM Server Installer in Unattended Mode



You can perform an unattended PEM server installation by providing installation preferences on the command line when invoking the installer. Please note that the system on which you are installing the PEM server must have internet access.

You must have Administrative privileges to install the PEM server. Before invoking the PEM server installer, you must install the following dependencies:

-   PostgreSQL
-   pem-httpd
-   Language Pack

You can use the PEM server installer to satisfy the dependencies of the PEM server; use the following command to extract the dependencies. Navigate to the location of the installer, and use the following command to extract the dependencies:

`pem-server-7.<x>.<x>-windows-x64.exe --extract-dependents C:\`

In our example, the files are extracted to the `C:\` directory. After extracting the files, you must install each program. Navigate into the directory that contains the files (in our example, `C:\)`, and enter:

`edb-languagepack-<version>-windows-x64.exe --mode unattended`  
`pem-httpd-<version>-windows-x64.exe --mode unattended`  
postgresql-&lt;version&gt;-windows-x64.exe --mode unattended

Then, you can invoke the PEM server installer:

`pem-server-7.<x>.<x>-windows-x64.exe --mode unattended`  
`--existing-user <registered_edb_user> --existing-password`  
`<edb_user_password> --pgport <port> --pguser postgres`  
`--pgpassword postgres -–cidr-address <cidr_address_range>`  
`--agent_description pem-agent --systempassword <windows_password>` `--agent-crt-path C:\edb`

Where:

> `registered_edb_user` specifies the name of a registered EnterpriseDB user. To register, visit the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user/register)
>
> `edb_user_password` specifies the password associated with the EDB user account.
>
> `port` specifies the port used by the backing PostgreSQL database; by default, the PostgreSQL database uses port `5432`.
>
> `cidr_address_range` specifies the address range that will be added to the `pg_hba.conf` file of the PEM server's backing database to allow connections from the agents that will be monitored by the server. You may wish to specify a network range (for example, 192.168.2.0/24) to provide server access to agents that reside on the same network.
>
> `windows_password` specifies the password associated with the Windows Administrator's account.
