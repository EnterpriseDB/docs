You can create a local repository to act as a host for RPM packages if the server on which you wish to install PEM cannot directly access the EnterpriseDB repository. Please note that this is a high-level overview of the steps required; you may need to modify the process for your individual network. To create and use a local repository, you must:

1.  Use a system with Internet access to download all the dependencies required:

<!-- -->

```
yum install yum-plugin-downloadonly

mkdir /tmp/<pem_dir>

yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=/tmp/<pem_dir>/ edb-pem

mkdir /tmp/<epel_dir>

yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=/tmp/<epel_dir>/ epel-release*
```

Where `<pem_dir>` and `<epel_dir>` are the local directories that you create for downloading the RPMs.

1.  Copy the `/tmp/<pem_dir>` and `/tmp/<epel_dir>` directories to the machine that is on the isolated network.
2.  Create the repositories:

<!-- -->

```
yum install createrepo

createrepo /tmp/<pem_dir>

createrepo /tmp/<epel_dir>
```

1.  Create a repository configuration file called `/etc/yum.repos.d/pem.repo` with connection information that specifies:

<!-- -->

```
[pemrepo]
name=PEM Repository
baseurl=file:///tmp//<pem_dir>/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
```

1.  Create a repository configuration file called `/etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo` with connection information that specifies:

<!-- -->

```
[epelrepo]
name=epel Repository
baseurl=file:///tmp/<epel_dir>/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
```

After specifying the location and connection information for your local repository, you can use yum commands to install or upgrade PEM server:

-   To install PEM server:

    `yum install edb-pem`

-   To upgrade PEM server:

    `yum upgrade edb-pem`
