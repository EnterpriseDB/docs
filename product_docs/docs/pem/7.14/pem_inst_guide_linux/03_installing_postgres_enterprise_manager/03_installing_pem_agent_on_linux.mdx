A PEM agent may monitor one or more servers on one or more hosts. For comprehensive information about managing a PEM agent, see the [PEM Agent User Guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/p/edb-postgres-enterprise-manager).

## Installing a PEM agent on a CentOS or RHEL host

On a Linux system, you can use the `yum` package manager to install a PEM agent. Please note that before using a package manager to install the PEM agent on a host, you must:

-   Install the `epel-release` package on the host by running any one of the following commands:
-   `yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm`
-   `yum install epel-release`

> </div>
>
> You may need to enable the `[extras]` repository definition in the `CentOS-Base.repo` file (located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`).
>
> </div>

-   You must also have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

    > [EnterpriseDB Repository Access Steps](https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/../images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf).

After receiving your repository credentials you can:

> 1.  Create the repository configuration file.
> 2.  Modify the file, providing your user name and password.
> 3.  Install the `edb-pem-agent` package.

**Creating a Repository Configuration File**

To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges, and invoke the following command:

> `yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm`

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

**Modifying the file, providing your user name and password**

After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to ensure that the value of the enabled parameter is `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

```
[edb]
name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```

If you want to install PEM Agent on a machine that is in isolated network, you must first create PEM repository on that machine. For more information about creating PEM repository on an isolated network, see [Creating a PEM repository in an Isolated Network](../03_installing_postgres_enterprise_manager/#creating_pem_repo_isolated_network).

**Installing the PEM Agent**

After saving your changes to the configuration file, you can use the `yum install` command to install `edb-pem-agent`:

> `yum install edb-pem-agent`

When the installation is complete, `yum` will display a list of the installed packages and dependencies.

![*Using an RPM package to install the PEM agent*](../images/pem_rpm_installation_agent.png)

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

## Installing a PEM Agent on a Debian or Ubuntu Host

To install PEM on a Debian or Ubuntu host, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, [contact EnterpriseDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request) .

The following steps will walk you through using the EnterpriseDB apt repository to install a Debian package. When using the commands, replace the username and password with the credentials provided by EnterpriseDB.

1.  Go to <https://apt.enterprisedb.com/> and log in as root:

    `sudo su -`

2.  Configure the EnterpriseDB repository:

    `sh -c 'echo "deb https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release - cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'`

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

    `apt-get install apt-transport-https`

4.  Add the EBD signing key:

    `wget -q -O -https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add –`

5.  Update the repository metadata:

    `apt-get update`

6.  Use the following command to install the Debian package for the PEM agent:

    `apt-get install edb-pem-agent`

## Installing a PEM Agent on a SLES Host

For detailed information about installing Advanced Server and supporting components on a SLES host, please consult the

[EDB Postgres Advanced Server Installation Guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/p/edb-postgres-enterprise-manager)

SLES packages are available from:

> <https://zypp.enterprisedb.com>

Before installing PEM, you must install prerequisite packages. Use the following commands replacing *sp_no* with the service pack that you are using (i.e. SP2 or SP3):

```
SUSEConnect -p sle-module-legacy/12/x86_64

SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12/x86_64

zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache:Modules/SLE_12_<sp_no>/Apache:Modules.repo

zypper addrepo http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Cloud:/OpenStack:/Newton:/cisco-apic:/2.3.1/SLE_12_<sp_no>/ pem_opensuse_boost

zypper refresh

zypper install edb-pem-agent
```

## Registering an Agent

Each PEM agent must be *registered* with the PEM server. The registration process provides the PEM server with the information it needs to communicate with the agent. The PEM agent graphical installer supports agent self-registration, but you can use the `pemworker` utility to register the agent if you skip PEM agent registration during a graphical installation or use an RPM package to install a PEM agent.

The RPM installer places the PEM agent in the `/usr/edb/pem/agent/bin` directory. To register an agent, include the `--register-agent` keywords along with registration details when invoking the `pemworker` utility:

> `pemworker --register-agent`

Append command line options to the command string when invoking the pemworker utility. Each option should be followed by a corresponding value:

| Option                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

If you want to use any PEM feature for which database server restart is required by the pemagent such as Audit Manager, Log Manager, or Tuning Wizard, then you must set the value for `allow_server_restart` as `true` in the `agent.cfg` file.

Note

</div>

When configuring a shell/batch script run by a PEM agent that has PEM 7.11 or later version installed, the user for the `batch_script_user parameter` must be specified. It is strongly recommended that a non-root user is used to run the scripts. Using the root user may result in compromising the data security and operating system security. However, if you want to restore the pemagent to its original settings using `root` user to run the scripts, then the `batch_script_user` parameter value must be set to `root`.

</div>

Before any changes are made on the PEM database, the connecting agent is authenticated with the PEM database server. When invoking the pemworker utility, you must provide the password associated with the PEM server administrative user role (`postgres`). There are three ways to specify the administrative password; you can:

-   set the `PEM_MONITORED_SERVER_PASSWORD` environment variable.
-   provide the password on the command line with the `PGPASSWORD` keyword.
-   create an entry in the `.pgpass` file.

Failure to provide the password will result in a password authentication error; you will be prompted for any other required but omitted information. When the registration is complete, the server will confirm that the agent has been successfully registered.

**Setting PEM Agent Configuration Parameters**

The PEM agent RPM installer creates a sample configuration file named `agent.cfg.sample` in the `/usr/edb/pem/agent/etc` directory. When you register the PEM agent, the `pemworker` program creates the actual agent configuration file (named `agent.cfg`). You must modify the `agent.cfg` file, adding the following configuration parameter:

> `heartbeat_connection = true`

You must also add the location of the `ca-bundle.crt` file (the certificate authority). By default, the installer creates a `ca-bundle.crt` file in the location specified in your `agent.cfg.sample` file. You can copy the default parameter value from the sample file, or, if you use a `ca-bundle.crt` file that is stored in a different location, specify that value in the `ca_file` parameter:

> `ca_file=/usr/libexec/libcurl-pem7/share/certs/ca-bundle.crt`

Then, use a platform-specific command to start the PEM agent service; the service is named `pemagent`. For example, on a CentOS or RHEL 6.x system, you would use the command:

> `/etc/init.d/pemagent start`

On a CentOS or RHEL 7.x or 8.x host, use systemctl to start the service:

> `systemctl start pemagent`

The service will confirm that it is starting the agent; when the agent is registered and started, it will be displayed on the `Global Overview` and in the `Object browser` of the PEM web interface.

For information about using the `pemworker` utility to register a server, please see the [PEM Administrator's Guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs)
