<div id="installing_pem_server_on_linux" class="registered_link"></div>




When installing a PEM server on a Linux host, you must first install a backing database and create the `pem` database cluster. The server’s backing database may be installed via an RPM package for Linux. The database must be one of the following versions:

-   EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 9.4 or above
-   PostgreSQL version 9.4 or above

For detailed information about installing an Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database, please see the product documentation at the EnterpriseDB website.

The `pg_hba.conf` file on the backing database must be configured to use `trust` authentication for connections. For information about modifying the pg\_hba.conf file, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

If you are using a PostgreSQL database, you must also install the [hstore contrib module](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/hstore.html).

If you are using a firewall, you must allow access to port `8443` on the PEM backing database; use the commands:

> `firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8443/tcp`
>
> `firewall-cmd --reload`

## Installing the PEM Server on a CentOS or RHEL Host

In addition to the above considerations, the following prerequisites are applicable if you are using a RHEL or CentOS host:

1.  You must install the `epel-release` package:

> `yum install epel-release`
>
> <div class="note">
>
> <div class="title">
>
> Note
>
> </div>
>
> </div>
>
> You may need to enable the `[extras]` repository definition in the `CentOS-Base.repo` file (located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`).
>
> If you are a Red Hat Network user you must also enable the `rhel-<x>-server-optional-rpms` repository to use EPEL packages, where *x* specifies the version of RHEL on the host. You can make the repository accessible by enabling the `RHEL optional subchannel` for `RHN-Classic`. If you have a certificate-based subscription, then you must also enable `rhel-<x>-server-eus-optional-rpms` repository to use EPEL packages or please see the `Red Hat Subscription Management Guide` for the required repository.

1.  You must also enable the `rhel-<x>-server-extras-rpms` repository, where `x` specifies the version of the RHEL on the host.

2.  If you are using a `RHEL 6.x` or `CentOS 6.x` host, you need to stop the default httpd server and run commands to install `rh-python36` before installing the PEM server. As part of PEM server installation, an `httpd24` server will be installed.

    1.  Stop the default httpd server using the command:

        `service httpd stop`

    2.  Run the following commands to install `rh-python36`:

        `yum install centos-release-scl`

        `yum install rh-python36`

3.  You must also have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials, visit:

    > [EnterpriseDB Repository Access Steps](https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/../images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf).

4.  Create a repository configuration file; assume superuser privileges, and invoke the following command:

> `yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm`

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

1.  After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to ensure that the value of the enabled parameter is `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

<!-- -->

    [edb]
    name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
    baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY

1.  Use yum to install the PEM server:

> `yum install edb-pem`

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

If you want to install PEM server on a machine that is in isolated network, you must first create PEM repository on that machine. For more information about creating PEM repository on an isolated network, see [Creating a PEM repository in an Isolated Network](../03_installing_postgres_enterprise_manager/#creating_pem_repo_isolated_network).

## Installing the PEM Server on a Debian or Ubuntu Host

To install PEM on a Debian or Ubuntu host, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, contact [EnterpriseDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request) .

The following steps will walk you through using the EnterpriseDB apt repository to install a Debian package. When using the commands, replace the username and password with the credentials provided by EnterpriseDB.

1.  Go to <https://apt.enterprisedb.com/> and log in as root:

    `sudo su -`

2.  Configure the EnterpriseDB repository:

    `sh -c 'echo "deb https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com $(lsb_release - cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'`

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

    `apt-get install apt-transport-https`

4.  Add the EBD signing key:

    `wget -q -O -https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add –`

5.  Update the repository metadata:

    `apt-get update`

6.  Use the following command to install the Debian package for the PEM server:

    `apt-get install edb-pem`

## Installing PEM Server on a SLES Host

For detailed information about installing Advanced Server and supporting components on a SLES host, please consult the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server Installation Guide*,available at:

> <https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/p/edb-postgres-enterprise-manager>

SLES packages are available from:

> <https://zypp.enterprisedb.com>

Before installing PEM, you must install prerequisite packages. Invoke the following commands, replacing *sp\_no* with the service pack that you are using (i.e. SP4):

> `SUSEConnect -p sle-module-legacy/12/x86_64`
>
> `SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12/x86_64`
>
> `zypper addrepo  https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache:Modules/SLE_12_<sp_no>/Apache:Modules.repo`
>
> `zypper addrepo http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Cloud:/OpenStack:/Newton:/cisco-apic:/2.3.1/SLE_12_<sp_no>/ pem_opensuse_boost`
>
> `zypper refresh`
>
> `zypper install edb-pem`

## Configuring the PEM Server

Before configuring the PEM server, ensure that the `sslutils` extension is installed for your backing database.

-   For an Advanced Server backing database, `sslutils` extension is by default installed along with Advanced Server.

-   If you are using a PostgreSQL backing database, ensure you have access to the PostgreSQL community repository, and use the command:

    > `yum install sslutils_<x> postgresql<X>-contrib`

Where, `x` is the server version.

The PEM server installer includes a script (`configure-pem-server.sh`) to help automate the configuration process for RPM installations. The script is installed in the `/usr/edb/pem/bin` directory. To invoke the script, use the command:

> `/usr/edb/pem/bin/configure-pem-server.sh`

When invoking the script, you can include command line options to specify configuration properties; the script will prompt you for values that you omit on the command line. The accepted options are:

| **Option** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

If you do not provide configuration properties on the command line, you will be prompted for values by the script. When you invoke the script, choose from:

1\. `Web Services and Database` -Select this option if the web server and database both reside on the same host as the PEM server.

2\. `Web Services` -Select this option if the web server resides on a different host than the PEM server.

3\. `Database` -Select this option to configure the PEM backing database for use by the PEM server. Please note that the specified database must reside on the local host.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

If the web server and the backing database reside on separate hosts, configure the database server first (option 3), and then web services (option 2). The script will exit if the backing database is not configured before web services.

</div>

After selecting a configuration option, the script will proceed to prompt you for configuration properties. When the script completes, it will create the objects required by the PEM server, or perform the configuration steps required.

To view script-related help, use the command:

> `/usr/edb/pem/bin/configure-pem-server.sh -help`

If you are using a RHEL or CentOS 6.x host, restart the httpd24 server after configuring the PEM server; use the command:

> `service httpd24-httpd restart`

After configuring the PEM server, you can access the PEM web interface in your browser. Navigate to:

> `https://<ip_address_of_PEM_server>:8443/pem`
