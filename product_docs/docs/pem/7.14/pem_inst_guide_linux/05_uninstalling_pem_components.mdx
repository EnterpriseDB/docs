The process of uninstalling the PEM server or agent is platform-specific. The name of the package for PEM server is `edb-pem` and for PEM agent is `edb-pem-agent`.

If you uninstall the PEM server package from a host, the PEM agent package installed on the same host doesn't get uninstalled. But if you uninstall the PEM agent package, then the PEM server package installed on the same host also gets uninstalled.

## Uninstalling PEM components from CentOS or RHEL hosts

You can use variations of the `rpm`, `yum remove`, or `yum erase` commands to remove the installed packages. Note that removing a package does not damage the PEM data directory.

-   Include the `-e` option when invoking the rpm command to remove an installed package; the command syntax is:

    `rpm -e <package_name>`

-   You can use the `yum remove` command to remove the pem server or agent package installed by yum. To remove a package, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter the command:

    `yum remove <package_name>`

-   You can use the `yum erase` command to remove the pem server or agent package along with the `edb-pem` and `edb-pem-docs` dependencies. To remove a package, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter the command:

    `yum erase <package_name>`

Where *package\_name* is the name of the package that you would like to remove.

## Uninstalling PEM components from Debian or Ubuntu hosts

You can use `apt-get remove` or `apt-get purge` command to uninstall the PEM server or agent package from a Debian or Ubuntu host:

-   To uninstall PEM server or agent from a Debian or Ubuntu host without impacting the configuration files and data directories, invoke the following command:

    `apt-get remove <package_name>`

-   To uninstall PEM server or agent along with the configuration files and data directory, invoke the following command:

    `apt-get purge <package_name>`

Where *package\_name* is the name of the package that you would like to remove.

## Uninstalling PEM components from SLES hosts

To uninstall PEM server or agent from a SLES host, invoke the follwoing command:

`zypper remove <package_name>`

Where *package\_name* is the name of the package that you would like to remove.
