Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) is designed to assist database administrators, system architects, and performance analysts when administering, monitoring, and tuning PostgreSQL and Advanced Server database servers. PEM has been designed to manage and monitor a single server or multiple servers from a single console, allowing complete control over monitored databases.

This document provides step-by-step instructions to guide you through the installation of Postgres Enterprise Manager on a Linux host.

For information about the platforms and versions supported by PEM, visit the EnterpriseDB website at:

Throughout this guide, the term *Postgres* refers to either a PostgreSQL or an Advanced Server installation, where either is appropriate.

Language pack installers contain supported languages that may be used with EDB Postgres Advanced Server and EnterpriseDB PostgreSQL database installers. The language pack installer allows you to install Perl, TCL/TK, and Python without installing supporting software from third party vendors. For more information about installing and using Language Pack, please see the *EDB Postgres Language Pack Guide*, available from the EnterpriseDB Website.
