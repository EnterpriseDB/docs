The following features have been added to create Postgres Enterprise Manager 7.8:

-   PEM 7.8 allows you to set the `enable_heartbeat_connection` to true during PEM agent registration; this creates a dedicated heartbeat connection between PEM Agent and server to constantly update the PEM server.
-   The PEM 7.8 interface has improved accessibility features such as keyboard navigation enabled across dialogs and wizards and new shortcut keys being added.
-   PEM 7.8 adds capabilities for making the Query tool history persistent across sessions.
-   Support has been added for the IDENTITY columns supported in PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server 10+.
