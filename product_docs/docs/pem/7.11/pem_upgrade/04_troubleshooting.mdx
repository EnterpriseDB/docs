## The pem.alert Table Fails to Restore

When restoring the `pem` backing database from backup, you may encounter an error during the restoration of the `pem.alert` table. This is caused by a missing table pre-requisite for the table - the `pg_restore` utility may restore the `pem.alert` pre-requisites *after* it attempts to restore `pem.alert`.

If this happens, the output from `pg_restore` will include error messages that refer to the `alert` table:

    pg_restore: [archiver (db)] could not execute query: ERROR: insert or
     update on table "alert_history" violates foreign key constraint
     "alert_history_alert_id_fkey"
    DETAIL: Key (alert_id)=(3) is not present in table "alert".
    Command was: ALTER TABLE ONLY alert_history
    ADD CONSTRAINT alert_history_alert_id_fkey FOREIGN KEY (alert_id)
     REFERENCES alert(id) ON...

    Command was: ALTER TABLE ONLY alert_status

If you encounter this problem, restore the `pem` database before restoring the `pem.alert` table. Restoring the `pem` database will install the pre-requisites for `pem.alert`, and the restoration of the table should complete as expected.
