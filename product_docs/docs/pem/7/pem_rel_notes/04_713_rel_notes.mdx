New features, enhancements, bug fixes,  and other changes in PEM 7.13 include:

| Type        | Description |  ID  |
|-------------|-------------| ---- |
| New Feature | Core Usage Report: The Core Usage report provides metrics such as total number of cores used by the EDB Postgres Advanced Server or Postgres database that is being managed by PEM. This report can help you understand if you are in compliance with core-based licensing guidelines. See [Core Usage Reports](../pem_ent_feat/11_reports) | PEM-3107 |
| New Feature | Schema Diff tool (Beta): The Schema Diff tool allows you to compare two database schema objects and synchronize the two schemas. The tool lists the differences and also generates the synchronization scripts for the two schemas. See [Schema Diff Tool](../pem_ent_feat/03_pem_schema_diff_tool)                                                   | [#3452](https://redmine.postgresql.org/issues/3452) |
