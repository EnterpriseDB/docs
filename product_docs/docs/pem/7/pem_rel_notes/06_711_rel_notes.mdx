title: "Version 7.11"
---

Features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in PEM 7.11 include:

| Highlights | Type |
| --------- | -----|
|Added configuration options to avoid a security risk in some environments running shell/batch scripts. The PEM Agent runs shell/batch probes and tasks under its service user account which is typically root (Administrator on Windows). The new options require system administrators to explicitly enable this functionality in the Agent configuration file if required. Note, this change may require users to update their PEM Agent configuration if they are using shell/batch tasks or probes. To return to the behaviour in prior versions of PEM on Windows, set AllowBatchJobSteps to true. To return to the behaviour in prior versions of PEM on Linux, set batch_script_user to root. | Enhancement |
