The following features have been added to Postgres Enterprise Manager 7.16:

-   **Enhanced BART Integration**: You can now automate the cleanup of obsolete backups, allow incremental backups from a parent backup in a `tar.gz` format,  and manage the BART scanner via the PEM Console.
-   **Enhanced EFM Integration**: You can now perform cluster switchover and monitor cluster property values such as `missingnodes`, `minimumstandbys` and `membershipcoordinators` for a Failover Manager cluster via the PEM Console.
-   **Auto-discovery of server clusters on Debian Platforms**: You can now quickly locate the database servers that reside on the monitored system.
-   **Extended the REST API on alerts states for agents, servers, and databases**: PEM has now exposed endpoints to: 
    -   Current threshold alert violations
    -   State change history on available alerts for agent, server, and database.
    -   Current state of all agents and monitored servers.
-   **Other features and changes include**:
    -   You can use the same agent-id on agent registration using `--force-registration` and regenerate the certificates.
    -   Documentation now includes information about defining and monitoring Postgres instances on `AWS EC2` and `RDS`.
    -   The `Query Tool` now provides SQL Formatter support.
    -   The `Query Tool` toolbar now has a button to provide easy access to a new query tool window.
    -   The modified `Schema diff` tool will now compare two databases instead of two schemas.
    -   Added High Contrast (Beta) theme support.
    -   A warning now alerts the user when connecting to a server version that is no longer supported.
    -   The management user interface for EDB Ark is no longer distributed with PEM.
