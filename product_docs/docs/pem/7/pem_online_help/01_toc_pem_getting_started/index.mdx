You can use either a graphical installer or an RPM package to install the PEM server and PEM agent; for detailed installation instructions, please see the Postgres Enterprise Manager Installation Guide, available at [www.enterprisedb.com](http://www.enterprisedb.com).

Each `server` in the PEM client tree control defines a set of connection and authentication properties that creates a connection to a Database server. The server can optionally bind the server to a PEM agent, defining a `managed` server, or not specify an agent binding, defining an `unmanaged` server. The process of defining the connection to a server is referred to as registering a server. You can use the `Auto Discovery` dialog to simplify the process of registering a managed server, or register a server manually.

You can (optionally) use the `Server Group` dialog to create server groups to organize the server connections within the tree control for easier server management. To open the `Server Group` dialog, open the `Object` menu, and select `Server Group` from the `Create` menu.
