You can use SQL Profiler to create and store up to 15 named traces; use menu options to create and manage traces.

## Creating a Trace

You can use the Create trace... dialog to define a SQL Trace for any database on which SQL Profiler has been installed and configured. [installed and configured](01_sp_installing_sql_profiler/#sp_installing_sql_profiler). To access the dialog, highlight the name of the database in the PEM client tree control; navigate through the `Management` menu to the `SQL Profiler` pull-aside menu, and select `Create trace...`.

![Create trace dialog - Trace options tab](../images/sp_create_new_trace.png)

Use the fields on the `Trace options` tab to specify details about the new trace:

-   Provide a name for the trace in the `Name` field.
-   Click in the `User filter` field to specify the roles whose queries will be included the trace; optionally, check the box next to `Select All` to include queries from all roles.
-   Click in the `Database filter` field to specify which databases to trace; optionally, check the box next to `Select All` to include queries against all databases.
-   Specify a trace size in the `Maximum Trace File Size` field; SQL Profiler will terminate the trace when it reaches approximately the size specified.
-   Specify `Yes` in the `Run Now` field to start the trace when you select the `Create` button; select `No` to enable fields on the `Schedule` tab.

![Create trace dialog - Schedule tab](../images/sp_create_new_trace_schedule.png)

Use the fields on the `Schedule` tab to specify scheduling details for the new trace:

-   Use the `Start time` field to specify the starting time for the trace.
-   Use the `End time` field to specify the ending time for the trace.
-   Specify `Yes` in the `Repeat?` field to indicate that the trace should be repeated every day at the times specified; select `No` to enable fields on the `Periodic job options` tab.

![Create trace - Schedule repeat tab](../images/sp_create_new_trace_periodic_job.png)

Fields on the `Periodic job options` tab specify scheduing details for a recurring trace. Use fields in the `Days` section to specify the days on which the job will execute:

-   Click in the `Week days` field to select the days of the week on which the trace will execute.
-   Click in the `Month days` field to select the days of the month on which the trace will execute.
-   Click in the `Months` field to select the months in which the trace will execute.

Use fields in the `Times` section to specify a time schedule for the trace execution:

-   Click in the `Hours` field to select the hours at which the trace will execute.
-   Click in the `Minutes` field to select the hours at which the trace will execute.

When you've completed the `Create trace...` dialog, click `Create` to start the newly defined trace or to schedule the trace for a later time. If you elect to execute the trace immediately, the trace results will display in the PEM client.

## Opening a Trace

To view a previous trace, highlight the name of the profiled database in the PEM client tree control; navigate through the `Management` menu to the `SQL Profiler` pull-aside menu, and select `Open trace...`. You can also use the SQL Profiler toolbar menu to open a trace; select the `Open trace...` option. The `Open trace...` dialog opens.

![Open existing trace dialog](../images/sp_open_existing_trace.png)

Highlight an entry in the trace list and click `Open` to open the selected trace. The selected trace opens in the SQL Profiler tab.

## Filtering a Trace

A filter is a named set of (one or more) rules, each of which can hide events from the trace view. When you apply a filter to a trace, the hidden events are not removed from the trace, but are merely excluded from the display. Click the `Filter` icon to open the `Trace Filter` dialog and create a rule (or set of rules) that define a filter. Each rule will screen the events within the current trace based on the identity of the role that invoked the event, or the query type invoked during the event.

![Trace filter - General tab](../images/sp_trace_filter.png)

To open an existing filter, select the`Open` button; to define a new filter, click the Add (+) button to add a row to the table displayed on the `General` tab and provide rule details:

-   Use the `Type` drop-down listbox to specify the trace field that the filter rule will apply to.
-   Use the `Condition` drop-down listbox to specify the type of operator that SQL Profiler will apply to the Value when it filters the trace:

> -   Select `Matches` to filter events that contain the specified Value.
> -   Select `Does not match` to filter events that do not contain the specified Value.
> -   Select `Is equal to` to filter events that contain an exact match to the string specified in the Value field.
> -   Select `Is not equal to` to filter events that do not contain an exact match to the string specified in the Value field.
> -   Select `Starts with` to filter events that begin with the string specified in the Value field.
> -   Select `Does not start with` to filter events that do not begin with the string specified in the Value field.
> -   Select `Less than` to filter events that have a numeric value less than the number specified in the Value field.
> -   Select `Greater than` to filter events that have a numeric value greater than the number specified in the Value field.
> -   Select `Less than or equal to` to filter events that have a numeric value less than or equal to the number specified in the Value field.
> -   Select `Greater than or equal to` to filter events that have a numeric value greater than or equal to the number specified in the Value field.

-   Use the `Value` field to specify the string, number or regular expression that SQL Profiler will search for.

When you've finished defining a rule, click the Add (+) button to add another rule to the filter. To delete a rule from a filter, highlight the rule and click the `Delete` icon.

Click the `Save` button to save the filter definition to a file without applying the filter; to apply the filter, click `OK`. Select `Cancel` to exit the Trace Filter dialog and discard any changes to the filter.

## Deleting a Trace

To delete a trace, highlight the name of the profiled database in the PEM client tree control; navigate through the `Management` menu to the `SQL Profiler` pull-aside menu, and select `Delete trace(s)...`. You can also use the SQL Profiler toolbar menu to delete a trace; select the `Delete trace(s)...` option. The `Delete traces...` dialog opens.

![Delete existing trace dialog](../images/sp_delete_trace.png)

Click the icon to the left of a trace name to mark one or more traces for deletion and click `Delete`.

![Delete existing trace notification](../images/sp_delete_trace.png)

The PEM client will acknowledge that the selected traces have been deleted.

## Viewing Scheduled Traces

To view a list of scheduled traces, highlight the name of the profiled database in the PEM client tree control; navigate through the `Management` menu to the `SQL Profiler` pull-aside menu, and select `Scheduled traces...`. You can also use the SQL Profiler toolbar menu to the list; select the `Scheduled traces...` option. The `Scheduled traces...` dialog opens.

![Scheduled traces dialog](../images/sp_scheduled_traces.png)

The `Scheduled traces...` dialog displays a list of the traces that are awaiting execution. Click the edit button to the left of a trace name to access detailed information about the trace:

![Scheduled traces details dialog](../images/sp_trace_details.png)

The `General` tab displays detailed information about the scheduled trace:

-   The `Status` field lists the status of the current trace.
-   The `Enabled?` switch displays `Yes` if the trace is enabled; `No` if the trace is disabled.
-   The `Name` field displays the name of the trace.
-   The `Agent` field displays the name of the agent responsible for executing the trace.
-   The `Last run` field displays the date and time of the last execution of the trace.
-   The `Next run` field displays the date and time of the next scheduled execution of the trace.
-   The `Created` field displays the date and time that the trace was defined.
