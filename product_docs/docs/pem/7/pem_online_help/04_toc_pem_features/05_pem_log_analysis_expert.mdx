The Postgres Log Analysis Expert analyzes the log files of servers that are registered with PEM, and produces a report that provides an overview of your Postgres cluster's usage based on log file entries. You can use information on the Log Analysis Expert reports to make decisions about optimizing your cluster usage and configuration to improve performance.

Before invoking the Postgres Log Analysis Expert, you must specify the `Service ID` on the `Advanced` tab of the server's properties dialog, and use the Log Manager wizard to enable log collection by the PEM server. To invoke the Log Manager wizard, select the `Log Manager...` option from the `Management` menu; check the box next to `Import logs to PEM` in the `Import Logs` panel of the wizard to enable log collection.

To open the `Postgres Log Analysis Expert` wizard, select the `Postgres Log Analysis Expert...` option from the `Management` menu of the PEM client. When the wizard's `Welcome` dialog opens, click `Next` to continue.

The wizard's `Analyzer selection` dialog displays a list of `Analyzers` from which you can select. Each Analyzer generates a corresponding table, chart, or graph that contains information gleaned from the log files.

![Postgres Log Analysis Expert Wizard - Select Analyzers page](../images/pem_log_analysis_expert_select_analyzers.png)

Check the box to the left of an Analyzer to indicate that the Log Analysis Expert should prepare the corresponding table, chart or graph. After making your selections, click `Next` to continue to the `Server selection` tree control.

![Postgres Log Analysis Expert Wizard - Select Servers page](../images/pem_log_analysis_expert_select_servers.png)

Use the tree control to specify which servers you would like the Postgres Log Analysis Expert to analyze. If you select multiple servers, the resulting report will contain the corresponding result set for each server in a separate (but continuous) list. Click `Next` to continue.

![Postgres Log Analysis Expert Wizard - Report Options page](../images/pem_log_analysis_expert_report_options.png)

Use the fields in the `Options` section to specify the analysis method and the maximum length of any resulting tables:

-   Use the `Aggregate method` drop-down to select the method used by the Log Analysis Expert to consolidate data for the selected time span - select from:
    -   `SUM` - `SUM` instructs the analyzer to calculate a value that is the sum of the collected values for the specified time span.
    -   `AVG` - `AVG` instructs the analyzer to calculate a value that is the average of the collected values for the specified time span.
    -   `MAX` - `MAX` instructs the analyzer to use the maximum value that occurs within a specified time span.
    -   `MIN` - `MIN` instructs the analyzer to use the minimum value that occurs within a specified time span.
-   Use the `Time span` field to specify the number of minutes that the analyzer will incorporate into each calculation for a point on a graph. For example, if the `Time span` is '5 minutes', and the `Aggregate method` is 'AVG', each point on the given graph will contain the average value of the activity that occurred within a five minute time span.
-   Use the `Rows limit` field to specify the maximum number of rows to include in a table.

Use the fields in the `Time Intervals` section to specify the time range that the Log Analysis Expert will analyze:

-   Set `Relative days` to `Yes` to enable the `(+/-)From date` field and specify the number of days before or after the date and time selected in the `From` field.
-   Use the `From` field to specify the starting date and time for the analysis.
-   Use the `To` field to specify the ending date and time for the analysis.
-   Use the `(+/-) From date` selector to specify the number of days before or after the `From` date that should be included in the analysis.

When you've specified the report options, click `Next` to continue.

You can select the default option (`Finish`) to view the Log Analysis Expert report in the PEM client's tabbed browser, or click the radio button next to `Download the report` to save a copy of the report to an HTML file for later use.

## Reviewing the Postgres Log Analysis Expert Report

If you've elected to review the report immediately, the Postgres Log Analysis Expert report will be displayed in the PEM Client window. If the report contains an analysis of more than one monitored server, the graphs will be displayed in sets; first the graphs, tables and charts that display statistics for one server, then the graphs for the next server in the report.

The Postgres Log Analysis Expert Report header displays the date and time that the report was generated, the time period that the report spans, and the Aggregation method specified when defining the report. The name of the server for which information is displayed is noted at the start of each section of the report.

The report displays the tables, graphs and charts that were selected in the Log Analysis Expert wizard. Use the `Jump To` button (located in the lower-right hand corner of the screen) to navigate to a specific graphic.
