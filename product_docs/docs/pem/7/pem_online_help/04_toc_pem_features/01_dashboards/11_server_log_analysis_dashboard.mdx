The header information on the `Server Log Analysis` dashboard displays the date and time that the server was started, the date and time that the page was last updated, and the current number of triggered alerts.

The `Server Log` table displays the contents of the log files that are stored on the PEM server. For content to displayed, you must check the box next to `Import logs to PEM` when using Log Manager to configure logging for the server.

Entries are displayed in chronological order, most-recent log entries first. Use the scroll bars to navigate through the log entries, or to view columns that are off of the display.

Headings at the top of the server log table identify the information stored in each column:

-   The `Id` column identifies the PEM agent that monitors the server that initiated the recorded transaction.
-   The `Server` column identifies the server that initiated the recorded transaction.
-   The `Timestamp` column displays the date and time that the log entry was made.
-   The `User Name` column displays the name of the user that executed the recorded transaction.
-   The `Database Name` column displays the name of the database on which the recorded transaction was executed.
-   The `Process ID` column displays the identifier of the process that executed the recorded transaction.
-   The `Session ID` column displays the identifier of the session in which the transaction was executed.
-   The `Transaction ID` column displays the transaction identifier.
-   The `Connection From` column displays the host name or IP address from which the client session connected.
-   The `Command` column displays the type of command executed.
-   The `Message` column displays the transaction message.
