Selecting the `Import Capacity Manager Template` from the `Manage Charts` tab's `Quick Links` section opens the `Create Chart` dialog, allowing you to select from your saved Capacity Manager templates. When the dialog opens, use the `Import capacity template` drop-down listbox to select the template you would like to use for your chart.

Use the fields on the `Create Chart` dialog to provide information about the chart:

-   Specify the name of the chart in the `Name` field.
-   Use the drop-down listbox in the `Category` field to specify the category in which this chart will be displayed. When adding a custom chart to a custom dashboard, the chart will be displayed for selection in the `Category` specified.
-   Use the radio buttons in the `Type` field to specify if the chart will be a `Line chart` or a `Table`.
-   Provide a description of the chart in the `Description` field. The description will be displayed to the user viewing the chart (on a custom dashboard) when they click the information icon.
