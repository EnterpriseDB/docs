Click the `Create New Chart` icon in the `Quick Links` section of the `Manage Charts` tab to open the `Create Chart` wizard. The `Create Chart` wizard will walk you through the steps required to define a new chart.

![Create New Chart Wizard - Configure Chart page](../../images/pem_create_new_chart_conf_chart.png)

Use the fields on the `Configure Chart` dialog to specify general information about the chart:

> -   Specify the name of the chart in the `Name` field.
> -   Use the drop-down listbox in the `Category` field to specify the category in which this chart will be displayed; when adding a custom chart to a custom dashboard, the chart will be displayed for selection in the `Category` specified.
> -   Use the radio buttons in the `Type` field to specify if the chart will be a `Line chart` or a `Table`.
> -   Provide a description of the chart in the `Description` field. The description will be displayed to the user viewing the chart (on a custom dashboard) when they click the information icon.

When you've completed the fields on the `Configure Chart` dialog, click `Next` to continue.

![Create New Chart Wizard - Metrics Selection page](../../images/pem_create_new_chart_select_metrics.png)

Use the fields on the `Select Metrics` dialog to select the metrics that will be displayed on the chart:

> -   Use the `Metric level` drop-down listbox to specify the level of the PEM hierarchy from which you wish to select metrics. You can specify `Agent`, `Database`, or `Server`. Each level offers access to a unique set of probes and metrics.
>
> -   Use the tree control in the `Available metrics` box to select the metrics that will be displayed on the chart.
>
>     -   If you are creating a table, you may only select metrics from one probe; each node of the tree control lists the metrics returned by a single probe. Expand a node of the tree control, and check the boxes to the left of a metric name to include that metric data in the table.
>     -   If you are creating a line chart, expand the nodes of the tree control and double-click each metric that you would like to include in the chart.
>
> -   Use the fields in the `Selected metrics` panel to specify how the metric data will be displayed in your chart. The selection panel displays the name of the metric in the (non-modifiable) `Metric [Probe]` column. You can:
>
>     -   Click the garbage can icon to delete a metric from the list of selected metrics.
>     -   Use the drop-down listboxes in the `Selection Criteria` column to specify the order of the data displayed.
>     -   Use the `Limit` field to specify the number of rows in a table or lines in a chart:
>
>     > -   The maximum number of lines allowed in a chart is 32.
>     > -   The maximum number of rows allowed in a table is 100.
>
> -   If you are creating a line chart, PEM supports comparisons of cross-hierarchy metrics.
>
>     -   Click the compare icon to open a selection box that allows you to select one or more probe-specific attributes (i.e. CPUs, interfaces, databases, etc.) to compare in the chart.
>     -   Click the copy icon to apply your selections to all of the metrics for the same probe. When the popup opens, click `Yes` to confirm that other selections for the same probe will be overwritten, or `No` to exit the popup without copying the attributes.

When you've completed the fields on the `Select Metrics` dialog, click `Next` to continue.

![Create New Chart - Display Options page](../../images/pem_create_new_chart_set_options.png)

Use the fields on the `Set Options` dialog to specify display options for your chart:

> -   Use the `Auto Refresh` field to specify the number of minutes between chart updates - choose a value from 1 to 120. The default auto refresh rate is 2 minutes.

Use fields under the `Line chart options` heading to specify display preferences for a line chart:

> -   Use the `Points to plot` field to specify the maximum number of points that will be plotted on the chart.
> -   Use the fields to the right of the `Historical span` label to specify how much historical data should be displayed on the chart:
>     -   Use the `Day(s)` field to specify the number of days of historical data that should be included on the chart.
>     -   Use the `Hour(s)` field to specify the number of hours of historical data that should be included on the chart.
>     -   Use the `Minute(s)` field to specify the number of minutes of historical data that should be included on the chart.
> -   Use the fields in the `Data extrapolation` box to specify if PEM should generate extrapolated data based on historical data.
>     -   Click the `No Extrapolation` label to omit extrapolated data from the chart.
>     -   Click the `Span` label to use the `Days` and `Hours` selectors to specify the period of time spanned by the metrics on the chart.
>     -   Click the `Threshold` label to use threshold selectors to specify a maximum or minimum value for the chart.

When you've completed the fields on the `Set Options` dialog, click `Next` to continue.

![Create New Chart Wizard - Permission Options page](../../images/pem_manage_charts_set_permissions.png)

Use the fields on the `Set Permissions` dialog to specify display options for your chart:

> -   Set the `Share with all` slider to `Yes` to indicate that the chart will be available to all authorized users, or `No` to restrict access to the users or groups specified in the `Access permissions` field.
> -   Use the `Access permissions` field to select the group or groups that will have access to the chart.

When you've finished defining the chart, click `Finish` to save your edits and add your chart to the list on the `Manage Charts` tab:
