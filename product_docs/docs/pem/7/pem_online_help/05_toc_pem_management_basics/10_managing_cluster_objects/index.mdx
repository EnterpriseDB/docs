Some object definitions reside at the cluster level; PEM provides dialogs that allow you to create these objects, manage them, and control their relationships to each other. To access a dialog that allows you to create a database object, right-click on the object type in the Browser tree control, and select the `Create` option for that object. For example, to create a new database, right-click on the `Databases` node, and select `Create Database...`
