The `Restore` dialog provides an easy way to use a Custom, tar, or Directory format backup taken with the PEM `Backup` dialog to recreate a database or database object. The `Backup` dialog invokes options of the pg_dump client utility; the `Restore` dialog invokes options of the pg_restore client utility.

You can use the `Query Tool` to play back the script created during a plain-text backup made with the `Backup` dialog. For more information about backing up or restoring, please refer to the documentation for [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-pgdump.html) or [pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-pgrestore.html).

![Restore dialog - General tab](../images/restore_general.png)

Use the fields on the `General` tab to specify general information about the restore process:

-   Use the drop-down listbox in the `Format` field to select the format of your backup file.

    > -   Select `Custom or tar` to restore from a custom archive file to create a copy of the backed-up object.
    > -   Select `Directory` to restore from a compressed directory-format archive.

-   Enter the complete path to the backup file in the `Filename` field. Optionally, select the `Browser` icon (ellipsis) to the right to navigate into a directory and select the file that contains the archive.

-   Use the `Number of Jobs` field to specify if pg_restore should use multiple (concurrent) jobs to process the restore. Each job uses a separate connection to the server.

-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Rolename` to specify the role that will be used to authenticate with the server during the restore process.

Click the `Restore options` tab to continue. Use the fields on the `Restore options` tab to specify options that correspond to `pg_restore` options.

![Restore dialog - Restore Options tab - Sections](../images/restore_sections.png)

-   Use the switches in the **Sections** box to specify the content that will be restored:

    > -   Move the switch next to `Pre-data` to the `Yes` position to restore all data definition items not included in the data or post-data item lists.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Data` to the `Yes` position to restore actual table data, large-object contents, and sequence values.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Post-data` to the `Yes` position to restore definitions of indexes, triggers, rules, and constraints (other than validated check constraints).

![Restore dialog - Restore Options tab - Type of objects section](../images/restore_objects.png)

-   Use the switches in the **Type of objects** box to specify the objects that will be restored:

    > -   Move the switch next to `Only data` to the `Yes` position to limit the restoration to data.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Only schema` to limit the restoration to schema-level database objects.

![Restore dialog - Restore Options tab - Do not save section](../images/restore_do_not_save.png)

-   Use the switches in the **Do not save** box to specify which objects will not be restored:

    > -   Move the switch next to `Owner` to the `Yes` position to exclude commands that set object ownership.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Privilege` to the `Yes` position to exclude commands that create access privileges.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Tablespace` to the `Yes` position to exclude tablespaces.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Comments` to the `Yes` position to exclude commands that set the comments. **Note:** This option is visible only for database server greater than or equal to 11.

![Restore dialog - Restore Options tab - Queries section](../images/restore_queries.png)

-   Use the switches in the **Queries** box to specify the type of statements that should be included in the restore:

    > -   Move the switch next to `Include CREATE DATABASE statement` to the `Yes` position to include a command that creates a new database before performing the restore.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Clean before restore` to the `Yes` position to drop each existing database object (and data) before restoring.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Single transaction` to the `Yes` position to execute the restore as a single transaction (that is, wrap the emitted commands in `BEGIN/COMMIT`). This ensures that either all the commands complete successfully, or no changes are applied. This option implies `--exit-on-error`.

![Restore dialog - Restore Options tab - Disable section](../images/restore_disable.png)

-   Use the switches in the **Disable** box to specify the type of statements that should be excluded from the restore:

    > -   Move the switch next to `Trigger` (active when creating a data-only restore) to the `Yes` position to include commands that will disable triggers on the target table while the data is being loaded.
    > -   Move the switch next to `No data for Failed Tables` to the `Yes` position to ignore data that fails a trigger.

![Restore dialog - Restore Options tab - Miscellaneous section](../images/restore_miscellaneous.png)

-   Use the switches in the **Miscellaneous/Behavior** box to specify miscellaneous restore options:

    > -   Move the switch next to `Verbose messages` to the `No` position to instruct `pg_restore` to exclude verbose messages.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Use SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION` to the `Yes` position to include a statement that will use a SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION command to determine object ownership (instead of an ALTER OWNER command).
    > -   Move the switch next to `Exit on error` to the `Yes` position to instruct `pg_restore` to exit restore if there is an error in sending SQL commands. The default is to continue and to display a count of errors at the end of the restore.

When youâ€™ve specified the details that will be incorporated into the pg_restore command, click the `Restore` button to start the process, or click the `Cancel` button to exit without saving your work. A popup will confirm if the restore is successful.

![Restore dialog - Successful Notifications popup](../images/restore_messages.png)

Use the **Stop Process** button to stop the Restore process.

Click `Click here for details` on the popup to launch the `Process Watcher`. The `Process Watcher` logs all the activity associated with the restore, and provides additional information for troubleshooting should the restore command encounter problems.
