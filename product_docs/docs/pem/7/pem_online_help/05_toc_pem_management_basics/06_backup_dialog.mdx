`PEM` uses the *pg_dump* utility to provide an easy way to create a backup in a plain-text or archived format. You can then use a client application (like `psql` or the `Query Tool`) to restore a plain-text backup file, or use the Postgres `pg_restore` utility to restore an archived backup. The `pg_dump` utility must have read access to all database objects that you want to back up.

You can backup a single table, a schema, or a complete database. Select the name of the backup source in the `Browser` tree control, right click to open the context menu, and select `Backup...` to open the `Backup` dialog. The name of the object selected will appear in the dialog title bar.

![Backup dialog - General tab](../images/backup_general.png)

Use the fields in the `General` tab to specify parameters for the backup:

-   Enter the name of the backup file in the `Filename` field. Optionally, select the `Browser` icon (...) to the right to navigate into a directory and select a file that will contain the archive.

-   Use the drop-down listbox in the `Format` field to select the format that is best suited for your application. Each format has advantages and disadvantages:

    > -   Select `Custom` to create a custom archive file that you can use with `pg_restore` to create a copy of a database. Custom archive file formats must be restored with `pg_restore`. This format offers the opportunity to select which database objects to restore from the backup file. `Custom` archive format is recommended for medium to large databases as it is compressed by default.
    > -   Select `Tar` to generate a tar archive file that you can restore with `pg_restore`. The tar format does not support compression.
    > -   Select `Plain` to create a plain-text script file. A plain-text script file contains SQL statements and commands that you can execute at the `psql` command line to recreate the database objects and load the table data. A plain-text backup file can be edited in a text editor, if desired, before using the `psql` program to restore database objects. `Plain` format is normally recommended for smaller databases; script dumps are not recommended for blobs. The SQL commands within the script will reconstruct the database to the last saved state of the database. A plain-text script can be used to reconstruct the database on another machine, or (with modifications) on other architectures.
    > -   Select `Directory` to generate a directory-format archive suitable for use with `pg_restore`. This file format creates a directory with one file for each table and blob being dumped, plus a `Table of Contents` file describing the dumped objects in a machine-readable format that `pg_restore` can read. This format is compressed by default.

-   Use the `Compression Ratio` field to select a compression level for the backup. Specify a value of zero to mean use no compression; specify a maximum compression value of 9. Please note that tar archives do not support compression.

-   Use the `Encoding` drop-down listbox to select the character encoding method that should be used for the archive.

-   Use the `Number of Jobs` field (when applicable) to specify the number of tables that will be dumped simultaneously in a parallel backup.

-   Use the dropdown listbox next to `Rolename` to specify the role that owns the backup.

Click the `Dump options` tab to continue. Use the box fields in the `Dump options` tab to provide options for `pg_dump`.

![Backup dialog - Dump Options tab - Sections options](../images/backup_sections.png)

-   Move switches in the **Sections** field box to select a portion of the object that will be backed up.

    > -   Move the switch next to `Pre-data` to the `Yes` position to include all data definition items not included in the data or post-data item lists.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Data` to the `Yes` position to backup actual table data, large-object contents, and sequence values.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Post-data` to the `Yes` position to include definitions of indexes, triggers, rules, and constraints other than validated check constraints.

![Backup dialog - Dump Options tab - Type of Objects](../images/backup_objects.png)

-   Move switches in the **Type of objects** field box to specify details about the type of objects that will be backed up.

    > -   Move the switch next to `Only data` to the `Yes` position to limit the back up to data.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Only schema` to limit the back up to schema-level database objects.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Blobs` to the `No` position to exclude large objects in the backup.

![Backup dialog - Dump Options tab - Do not save options](../images/backup_do_not_save.png)

-   Move switches in the **Do not save** field box to select the objects that will not be included in the backup.

    > -   Move the switch next to `Owner` to the `Yes` position to exclude commands that set object ownership.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Privilege` to the `Yes` position to exclude commands that create access privileges.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Tablespace` to the `Yes` position to exclude tablespaces.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Unlogged table data` to the `Yes` position to exclude the contents of unlogged tables.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Comments` to the `Yes` position to exclude commands that set the comments. **Note:** This option is visible only for database server greater than or equal to 11.

![Backup dialog - Dump Options tab - Queries options](../images/backup_queries.png)

-   Move switches in the **Queries** field box to specify the type of statements that should be included in the backup.

    > -   Move the switch next to `Use Column Inserts` to the `Yes` position to dump the data in the form of INSERT statements and include explicit column names. Please note: this may make restoration from backup slow.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Use Insert commands` to the `Yes` position to dump the data in the form of INSERT statements rather than using a COPY command. Please note: this may make restoration from backup slow.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Include CREATE DATABASE statement` to the `Yes` position to include a command in the backup that creates a new database when restoring the backup.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Include DROP DATABASE statement` to the `Yes` position to include a command in the backup that will drop any existing database object with the same name before recreating the object during a backup.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Load Via Partition Root` to the `Yes` position, so when dumping a COPY or INSERT statement for a partitioned table, target the root of the partitioning hierarchy which contains it rather than the partition itself. **Note:** This option is visible only for database server greater than or equal to 11.

![Backup dialog - Dump Options tab - Disable options](../images/backup_disable.png)

-   Move switches in the **Disable** field box to specify the type of statements that should be excluded from the backup.

    > -   Move the switch next to `Trigger` (active when creating a data-only backup) to the `Yes` position to include commands that will disable triggers on the target table while the data is being loaded.
    > -   Move the switch next to `$ quoting` to the `Yes` position to enable dollar quoting within function bodies; if disabled, the function body will be quoted using SQL standard string syntax.

![Backup dialog - Dump Options tab - Miscellaneous options](../images/backup_miscellaneous.png)

-   Move switches in the **Miscellaneous** field box to specify miscellaneous backup options.

    > -   Move the switch next to `With OIDs` to the `Yes` position to include object identifiers as part of the table data for each table.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Verbose messages` to the `No` position to instruct `pg_dump` to exclude verbose messages.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Force double quotes on identifiers` to the `Yes` position to force the quoting of all identifiers.
    > -   Move the switch next to `Use SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION` to the `Yes` position to include a statement that will use a SET SESSION AUTHORIZATION command to determine object ownership (instead of an ALTER OWNER command).

When youâ€™ve specified the details that will be incorporated into the pg_dump command:

-   Click the `Backup` button to build and execute a command that builds a backup based on your selections on the `Backup` dialog.
-   Click the `Cancel` button to exit without saving work.

![Backup Success Notification popup](../images/backup_messages.png)

Use the **Stop Process** button to stop the Backup process.

If the backup is successful, a popup window will confirm success. Click *More details* on the popup window to launch the *Process Watcher*. The *Process Watcher* logs all the activity associated with the backup and provides additional information for troubleshooting.

![Backup Process Watcher](../images/backup_process_watcher.png)

If the backup is unsuccessful, you can review the error messages returned by the backup command on the `Process Watcher`.
