PEM provides a number of benefits not found in any other PostgreSQL management tool:

-   **Management en Masse Design** - PEM is designed for enterprise database management and is built to tackle the management of large numbers of servers across geographical boundaries. Global dashboards keep you up to date on the up/down/performance status of all your servers in an at-a-glance fashion.

-   **Distributed Architecture** - PEM is architected in a way that maximizes its ability to gather statistical information and to perform operations remotely on machines regardless of operating system platform.

-   **Graphical Administration** - All aspects of database administration can be carried out in the PEM client via a graphical interface. Server startup and shutdown, configuration management, storage and security control, object creation, performance management, and more can be handled from a single console.

-   **Full SQL IDE** - PEM contains a robust SQL integrated development environment (IDE) that provides ad-hoc SQL querying, stored procedure/function development and a graphical debugger.

-   **Enterprise Performance Monitoring** - PEM provides enterprise-class performance monitoring for all managed database servers. Lightweight and efficient agents monitor all aspects of each database server’s operations as well as each machine’s underlying operating system and provide detailed statistics back to easily navigated performance pages within the interface.

-   **Proactive Alert Management** - PEM ships out-of-the-box with the ability to create performance thresholds for each key metric (e.g. memory, storage, etc.) that are monitored around the clock. Any threshold violation results in an alert being sent to a centralized dashboard that communicates the nature of the problem and what actions are necessary to prevent the situation from jeopardizing the overall performance of the server.

-   **Simplified Capacity Planning** - All key performance-related statistics are automatically collected and retained for a specified period of time in the PEM’s repository. The Capacity Manager utility allows you to select various statistics and perform trend analysis over time to understand things such as peak load periods, storage consumption trends, and much more. A forecasting mechanism in the tool allows you to also forecast resource usage in the future and plan/budget accordingly.

-   **Audit Manager** - The Audit Manager configures audit logging on Advanced Server instances. Activities such as connections to a database, disconnections from a database, and the SQL statements run against a database can be logged. The Audit Log dashboard can then be used to filter and view the log.

-   **Log Manager** - The Log Manager wizard configures server logging parameters with (optional) log collection into a central table. Use the wizard to specify your preference for logging behaviors such as log file rotation, log destination, and the error message severity. Use the Server Log dashboard to filter and review the collected server log entries.

-   **SQL Workload Profiling** - PEM contains a SQL profiling utility that allows you to trace the SQL statements that are executed against one or more servers. SQL profiling can either be done in an ad-hoc or scheduled manner. Captured SQL statements can then be filtered so you can easily identify and tune poorly running SQL statements. SQL statements can also be fed into an Index Advisor on Advanced Server that analyzes each statement and makes recommendations on new indexes that should be created to help performance.

-   **Expert Database Analysis** - PEM includes the Postgres Expert utility. Postgres Expert analyzes selected databases for best practice enforcement purposes. Areas such as general configuration, security setup, and much more are examined. Any deviations from recommended best practices are reported back to you, along with an explanation of each particular issue, and expert help on what to do about making things right.

-   **Streaming Replication Monitoring** - You can monitor the Streaming Replication dashboard or use options on the PEM client to promote a replica node to the primary node.

-   **Secure Client Connectivity** - PEM supports secure client connections through an encrypted SSH tunnel. The full-featured PEM client includes an SSH Tunnel definition dialog that allows you to provide connection information for a secure connection.

-   **Wide Platform Support** - PEM supports most major Linux and Windows platforms.
