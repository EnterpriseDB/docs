For detailed instructions about installing PEM, please consult the `PEM Installation Guides`, available at:

   https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/

The basic steps involved in the PEM installation process are:

1. Install the PEM server components. The PEM server software and backend database (named pem) may reside on the same host as the supporting httpd server, or may reside on a separate host. The PEM server installer installs a PEM agent and the PEM Web client on the host of the PEM server.

2. Register each additional physical or virtual machine that you would like to manage with PEM. For convenience, PEM supports remote monitoring (an agent is not required to reside on the same host as the server that it monitors). Please note that a remote agent cannot retrieve all of the information available from a monitored server; you may wish to install an agent on each server host.

3. Install the SQL Profiler component into each Postgres instance on which you want to perform SQL capture and analysis. The SQL Profiler installer will prompt you for the location of your Postgres installation, and place the required software into that directory. The SQL Profiler plugin is already installed on Advanced Server instances, and requires only configuration to enable profiling.
