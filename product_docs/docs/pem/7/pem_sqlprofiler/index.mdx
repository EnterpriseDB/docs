title: "SQL Profiler"
---

Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) is designed to assist database administrators, system architects, and performance analysts when administering, monitoring, and tuning PostgreSQL and Advanced Server database servers. PEM has been designed to manage and monitor a single server or multiple servers from a single console, allowing complete control over monitored databases.

The SQL Profiler Plugin works with PEM to allow you to profile a server's workload. The SQL Profiler plugin may be installed on servers with or without a PEM Agent, however traces can only be run in ad-hoc mode on unmanaged servers, and may only be scheduled on managed servers.

This document provides step-by-step instructions to guide you through the installation and use of SQL Profiler.

SQL Profiler is officially supported only on the EDB distributions of PostgreSQL and Advanced Server supported versions . The plugin is distributed via StackBuilder, or as operating system dependent packages in EDB's yum repositories. The plugin is also distributed and installed with the Advanced Server installations.

Throughout this guide, the term `Postgres` refers to either a PostgreSQL or an Advanced Server installation, where either is appropriate.
