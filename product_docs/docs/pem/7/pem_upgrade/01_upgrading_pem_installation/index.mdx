The process of upgrading a PEM installation is platform-specific. 

-   For Windows, you can update a PEM Agent or Server using the PEM graphical installer. 
-   For Linux,
    -   Prior to PEM 7.8 version, PEM Agent or Server could be installed on Linux either by using the graphical installer or by using the RPMs. 
    -   From PEM 7.8 version onwards, PEM graphical installers for Linux are discontinued. To update a PEM Agent or Server from any lower version to higher versions, you must use native packages.

Links to PEM and SQL Profiler installers and RPMs are available at the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/edb-postgres-enterprise-manager).
