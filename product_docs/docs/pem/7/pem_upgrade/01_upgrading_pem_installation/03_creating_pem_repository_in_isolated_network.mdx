title: "Creating a PEM Repository on an Isolated Network"
---

You can create a local repository to act as a host for the PEM RPM packages if the server on which you wish to upgrade PEM cannot directly access the EDB repository. Please note that this is a high-level overview of the steps required; you may need to modify the process for your individual network. To create and use a local repository, you must:

1.  Use the following commands on a system with Internet access to download the dependencies for PEM:

    ```text
    yum install yum-plugin-downloadonly

    mkdir /<pem_dir>

    yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=/<pem_dir>/ edb-pem

    mkdir /<epel_dir>

    yum install --downloadonly --downloaddir=/<epel_dir>/ epel-release*
    ```

    Where `<pem_dir>` and `<epel_dir>` are the local directories that you create for downloading the RPMs.

2.  Copy the directories `/<pem_dir>` and `/<epel_dir>` to the machine that is in the isolated network.

3.  Create the repositories:

    ```text
    createrepo /<pem_dir>

    createrepo /<epel_dir>
    ```

4.  Create a repository configuration file called `/etc/yum.repos.d/pem.repo` with connection information that specifies:

    ```text
    [pemrepo]
    name=PEM Repository
    baseurl=file:///pem7/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0
    ```

5.  Create a repository configuration file called `/etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo` with connection information that specifies:

    ```text
    [epelrepo]
    name=epel Repository
    baseurl=file:///pem7/
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0
    ```

6.  After specifying the location and connection information for your local repository, you can use yum commands to install or upgrade PEM server:

    To install PEM server:

    ```text
    yum install edb-pem
    ```

    To upgrade PEM server:

    ```text
    yum upgrade edb-pem
    ```
