This guide will acquaint you with the tools and wizards that are built into the Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) web interface that make it easier for you to monitor and manage your system.

This guide is not a comprehensive resource; rather, it is meant to serve as an aid to help you evaluate the tool and bring you up to speed with the basics of how to use the product. For more detailed information about using PEM's functionality, please see the online help made available by the PEM client.

This document uses `Postgres` to mean either the PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server database.
