This document provides detailed information about using pgBouncer as a connection pooler for limiting the number of connections from the PEM Agent towards the Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) server on non-Windows machine:

-   Preparing the PEM Database Server – Chapter 3 provides information about preparing the PEM database server to be used with pgBouncer.
-   Configuring pgBouncer – Chapter 4 provides detailed information about configuring pgBouncer to make it work with the PEM database server.
-   Configuring the PEM Agent – Chapter 5 provides detailed information about configuring a PEM agent to connect to pgBouncer.

For detailed information about using the PEM 7 web interface, please see the *PEM Getting Started Guide*.
