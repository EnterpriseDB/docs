Each PEM agent connects to the PEM database server using the SSL certificates for each individual user. For example, an agent with `ID#1` connects to the PEM database server using the `agent1` user.

Prior to PEM version 7.5, the following limitations disallowed the use of the connection pooler between the PEM server and PEM agent:

-   The PEM agent uses an SSL Certificate to connect the PEM database server.
-   It uses an individual user identifier when connecting to the PEM database server.

EDB has modified the PEM agent to allow the agent to use a common database user (instead of the dedicated agent users) to connect the PEM database server.

![Connecting to pgBouncer.](../images/pem_database_with_pgbouncer.png)

We recommend using PgBouncer versions equal to or later than version 1.9.0 as the connection pooler. Versions 1.9.0 or later support `cert` authentication; PEM Agents can connect to pgBouncer using SSL certificates.
