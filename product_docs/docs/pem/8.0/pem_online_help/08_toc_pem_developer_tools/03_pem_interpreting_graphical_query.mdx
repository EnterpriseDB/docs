The graphical explain plan provides clues that can help you identify the aspects of the selected query that consume the most resources; within the diagram, thicker lines indicate the portions of the query that are expected to take the most processing time.

To view a graphical interpretation of an executed query, select `Explain` or `Explain Analyze` from the `Execute/Refresh` drop-down menu. Please note that you can use the `Explain Options` pull-aside menu to specify the level of detail displayed for each node.

Hover over an icon within the plan to view details for the selected node:

Each query operator (within the selected query) is represented in the graphical display by an icon. The table below describes the Advanced Server query operators:

| Icon                                                                    | Represents                              | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ![Result set icon](../images/result_set_icon.png)                       | Result Set                              | The Result Set icon represents a simple result set in the query plan. Typically, a Result Set operator is used to evaluate a query that does not fetch data from a table.                                                                            |
| ![Aggregat icon](../images/aggregate_icon.png)                          | Aggregate                               | The server creates an Aggregate operator whenever the query invokes an aggregate function (a function that returns a value computed from multiple rows). Aggregate functions include: AVG(), COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), STDDEV(), SUM(), and VARIANCE(). |
| ![Window aggregate icon](../images/window_aggregate_icon.png)           | Window Aggregate                        | The server may use a Window aggregate operator to implement windowed aggregate functions; a windowed aggregate function is a function that returns a value computed from a set of rows within the input.                                             |
| ![Seek icon](../images/seek_icon.png)                                   | Seek                                    | The server may use a Seek operator in any plan that includes an Index Scan operator. The Seek operator represents a probe into the heap to fetch the tuple that corresponds to an index entry (found by the Index Scan operator).                    |
| ![Seq scan icon](../images/seq_scan_icon.png)                           | Seq Scan                                | The server may use a Seq scan (sequential scan) to read through a table from beginning to end.                                                                                                                                                       |
| ![Index scan icon](../images/index_scan_icon.png)                       | Index Scan                              | The server may use an Index scan operator to read through a table in the order specified in the index.                                                                                                                                               |
| ![CTE scan icon](../images/cte_scan_icon.png)                           | CTE Scan                                | The server may use a CTE Scan operator if the query performs a scan of a common table expression.                                                                                                                                                    |
| ![Tuple id scan icon](../images/tuple_id_scan_icon.png)                 | Tuple ID Scan                           | The server uses a Tuple ID scan if the query uses the Tuple ID (ctid) as a constraint in a WHERE clause.                                                                                                                                             |
| ![Group icon](../images/group_icon.png)                                 | Group                                   | The server may use a Group operator when the query includes a GROUP BY clause. The operator requires a single input set ordered by the target column(s).                                                                                             |
| ![Sort icon](../images/sort_icon.png)                                   | Sort                                    | The server may use a Sort operator when a query includes an ORDER BY clause to impose an order on a result set.                                                                                                                                      |
| ![Limit icon](../images/limit_icon.png)                                 | Limit                                   | The server may use the Limit operator to limit the size of a result set (when a query includes the LIMIT or OFFSET clause).                                                                                                                          |
| ![Sub plan icon](../images/subplan_icon.png)                            | Sub Plan                                | The server may use a Subplan operator for queries that include subselects.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ![Unique icon](../images/unique_icon.png)                               | Unique                                  | The server may use the Unique operator to remove duplicate values from a result set; the diagram will include a Unique operator if the query includes a DISTINCT clause.                                                                             |
| ![Hash icon](../images/hash_icon.png)                                   | Hash                                    | The server may use a Hash operator when joining two input sets that are not ordered by the column that controls the join.                                                                                                                            |
| ![Hash semi join icon](../images/hash_semi_join_icon.png)               | Hash Semi-Join                          | The server may use a Hash Semi-Join operator to evaluate a query that joins two tables, but returns data from only one of those tables.                                                                                                              |

| ![Hash set operator icon](../images/hash_set_operator_icon.png)         | Hash Set Operator (Setop) Intersect     | The server may use an Intersect Set operator if the query includes an INTERSECT clause.                                                                                                                                                              |
| ![Hash setop int all icon](../images/hash_setop_int_all_icon.png)       | Hash Set Operator (Setop) Intersect All | The server may use an Intersect Set operator if the query includes an INTERSECT ALL.                                                                                                                                                                 |

A Merge Join requires two sets of inputs, where each set is ordered by the column used for the comparison.                                                                              |

While you cannot directly specify the execution plan of a query, you can use indexes, configuration parameters and optimizer hints to direct Advanced Server as it selects from the query plans presented by the server. See the following resources for more information about query optimization:

-   For more information about interpreting and understanding a query plan, see Using EXPLAIN, in the PostgreSQL documentation.
-   For information about using PEM's Index Advisor, see the EDB Postgres Advanced Server Guide, available from the EnterpriseDB website at [www.enterprisedb.com](http://www.enterprisedb.com).
