title: "Alert Templates"
---

<div id="pem_alert_templates" class="registered_link"></div>

An alert definition contains a system-defined or user-defined set of conditions that PEM compares to the system statistics; if the statistics deviate from the boundaries specified for that statistic, the alert triggers, and the PEM client displays a warning on the `Alerts Overview` page, and optionally sends a notification to a monitoring user.

The table below lists the system-defined alert templates that you can use to create an alert; please note that this list is subject to change, and may vary by system.

Within the table, the alerts are sorted by the target of the alert. The `Template Name` and `Description` columns identify and describe the behavior of the template. If the template `Details` column specifies `Yes`, metrics returned by the alert and alert parameters (if applicable) are accessible in the `Alerts table` on the `Global Overview` or `Alerts` dashboards:
