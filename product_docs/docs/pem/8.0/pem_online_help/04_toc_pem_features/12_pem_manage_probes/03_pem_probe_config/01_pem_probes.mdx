A `probe` is a scheduled task that retrieves information about the database objects that are being monitored by the PEM agent. PEM uses the collected information to build the graphs displayed on each homepage. The `Manage Probes` tab (accessed via the `Management` menu) allows you to modify the data collection schedule and the length of time that PEM will retain information returned by a specific probe.

Unless otherwise noted, Postgres Enterprise Manager enables the probes listed in the table below:
