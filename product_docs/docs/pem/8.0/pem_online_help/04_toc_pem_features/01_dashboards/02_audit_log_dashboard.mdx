The Audit Log Dashboard allows you to browse the audit logs that have been collected from Advanced Server instances which have enabled audit logging and collection with the [Audit Manager](../04_audit_manager/#audit_manager). If the Audit Log Dashboard is opened from the Global level, it will display logs from all servers. If opened from the Agent level, it will show logs from all servers monitored by that Agent. If opened from the Server level, it will show logs from that server only.
