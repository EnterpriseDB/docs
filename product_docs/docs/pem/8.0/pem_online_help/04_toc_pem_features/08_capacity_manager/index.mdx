PEM's Capacity Manager analyzes collected statistics (metrics) to generate a graph or table that displays the historical usage statistics of an object, and can project the anticipated usage statistics for an object. You can configure Capacity Manager to collect and analyze metrics for a specific:

-   Host/operating system
-   EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL server
-   Database
-   Database object (table, index, function etc).

You can tailor the content of the Capacity Manager report by choosing a specific metric (or metrics) to include in the report, the time range over which the metrics were gathered, and a high or low threshold for the metrics analyzed. You can also specify a start and end date for the Capacity Manager report. If the end date of the report specifies a time in the future, Capacity Manager will analyze the `historical` usage of the selected object to extrapolate the `projected` object usage in the future.

To open Capacity Manager, select the `Capacity Manager...` option from the `Management` menu in the PEM client window; the `Capacity Manager` wizard opens, displaying a tree control on the `Metrics` tab.

![Capacity Manager dialog](../../images/capacity_manager_opens.png)

Expand the tree control on the [Metrics](01_capacity_manager_metrics/#capacity_manager_metrics) tab to select the metrics that will be included in the Capacity Manager report.

When defining report options, you can specify an `aggregation` method for each selected metric. The aggregation method determines how Capacity Manager will analyze the data points within the sampling period to reduce the data to a more visually meaningful quantity within a report (if required). The aggregation method can instruct Capacity Manager to compute an average of the data within a time period, the high or low value, or the first sampled value.

Use the [Options](02_capacity_manager_options/#capacity_manager_options) tab to specify additional report details.

When defining the boundaries of a Capacity Manager report, specify the starting date and time, and an end boundary. The end boundary can be a point in time or a threshold boundary (when the data meets a specified criteria). If the sample contains more data points than the number of points specified by the <span class="title-ref">cm_data_points_per_report &lt;pem_config_options></span> configuration parameter, Capacity Manager applies the aggregation method to calculate a reduced number of graph points for the report.

## Report Templates

You can save a report definition as a template for future reports. Capacity Manager report templates may be accessed by all PEM users. To save a report definition as a template:

1.  Use the `Metrics` and `Options` tabs to define your report.
2.  Click the `Save` button to open the `Save Template` dialog.
3.  Provide a report name in the Title field, select a location to store the template in the tree control.
4.  Click `OK`.

When creating a report, you can use the `Load Template` button to browse and open an existing template. Once opened, the report definition may be modified if required, and optionally saved again, either as a new template, or overwriting the original template. Use the `Manage Templates` button open a dialog that allows you to rename or remove unwanted templates.
