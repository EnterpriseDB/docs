title: "PEM Agent Privileges"
---

<div id="pem_agent_privileges" class="registered_link"></div>

By default, the PEM agent is installed with `root` privileges for the operating system host and superuser privileges for the database server. These privileges allow the PEM agent to invoke unrestricted probes on the monitored host and database server about system usage, retrieving and returning the information to the PEM server.

Please note that PEM functionality diminishes as the privileges of the PEM agent decrease. For complete functionality, the PEM agent should run as `root` and on the same host as the database server.

> -   If the PEM agent is run under the database server's service account, PEM probes will not have complete access to the statistical information used to generate reports, and functionality will be limited to the capabilities of that account.
> -   If the PEM agent is run under another lesser-privileged account, functionality will be limited even further.
> -   If the PEM agent is installed on a different host and is monitoring the database server remotely, then the functionality will be limited.
