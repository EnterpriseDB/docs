Use the `Materialized View` dialog to define a materialized view. A materialized view is a stored or cached view that contains the result set of a query. Use the REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW command to update the content of a materialized view.

The `Materialized View` dialog organizes the development of a materialized_view through the following dialog tabs: `General`, `Definition`, `Storage`, `Parameter`, and `Security`. The `SQL` tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

![Create Materialized View dialog - General tab](../../images/materialized_view_general.png)

Use the fields in the `General` tab to identify the materialized view:

-   Use the `Name` field to add a descriptive name for the materialized view. The name will be displayed in the `Browser` tree control.
-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Owner` to select the role that will own the materialized view.
-   Select the name of the schema in which the materialized view will reside from the drop-down listbox in the `Schema` field.
-   Store notes about the materialized view in the `Comment` field.

Click the `Definition` tab to continue.

![Create Materialized View dialog - Definition tab](../../images/materialized_view_definition.png)

Use the text editor field in the `Definition` tab to provide the query that will populate the materialized view. Please note that updating the definition of existing materialized view would result in loss of Parameter(Table, Toast), Security(Privileges & Security labels), Indexes and other dependent objects.

Click the `Storage` tab to continue.

![Create Materialized View dialog - Storage tab](../../images/materialized_view_storage.png)

Use the fields in the `Storage` tab to maintain the materialized view:

-   Move the `With Data` switch to the `Yes` position to specify the materialized view should be populated at creation time. If not, the materialized view cannot be queried until you invoke REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW.
-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Tablespace` to select a location for the materialized view.
-   Use the `Fill Factor` field to specify a fill factor for the materialized view. The fill factor for a table is a percentage between 10 and 100. 100 (complete packing) is the default.

Click the `Parameter` tab to continue.

![Create Materialized View dialog - Parameter tab](../../images/materialized_view_parameter.png)

Use the tabs nested inside the `Parameter` tab to specify VACUUM and ANALYZE thresholds; use the `Table` tab and the `Toast Table` tab to customize values for the table and the associated toast table. To change the default values:

-   Move the `Custom auto-vacuum?` switch to the `Yes` position to perform custom maintenance on the materialized view and to select values in the `Vacuum table`. The `Vacuum Table` provides default values for maintenance operations.
-   Changing `Autovacuum enabled?` to `Not set` will reset autovacuum_enabled.

Click the `Security` tab to continue.

![Create Materialized View dialog - Security tab](../../images/materialized_view_security.png)

Use the `Security` tab to assign privileges and define security labels.

Use the `Privileges` panel to assign privileges to a role. Click the `Add` icon (+) to set privileges for the materialized view:

-   Select the name of the role from the drop-down listbox in the `Grantee` field.
-   Click inside the `Privileges` field. Check the boxes to the left of one or more privileges to grant the selected privilege to the specified user.
-   The current user, who is the default grantor for granting the privilege, is displayed in the `Grantor` field.

Click the `Add` icon (+) to assign additional privileges; to discard a privilege, click the trash icon to the left of the row and confirm deletion in the `Delete Row` popup.

Use the `Security Labels` panel to define security labels applied to the materialized view. Click the `Add` icon (+) to add each security label selection:

-   Specify a security label provider in the `Provider` field. The named provider must be loaded and must consent to the proposed labeling operation.
-   Specify a a security label in the `Security Label` field. The meaning of a given label is at the discretion of the label provider. PostgreSQL places no restrictions on whether or how a label provider must interpret security labels; it merely provides a mechanism for storing them.

Click the `Add` icon (+) to assign additional security labels; to discard a security label, click the trash icon to the left of the row and confirm deletion in the `Delete Row` popup.

Click the `SQL` tab to continue.

Your entries in the `Materialized View` dialog generate a SQL command (see an example below). Use the `SQL` tab for review; revisit or switch tabs to make any changes to the SQL command.

**Example**

The following is an example of the sql command generated by user selections in the `Materialized View` dialog:

![Create Materialized View dialog - SQL tab](../../images/materialized_view_sql.png)

The example shown creates a query named `new_hires` that stores the result of the displayed query in the `pg_default` tablespace.

-   Click the `Info` button (i) to access online help. View context-sensitive help in the `Tabbed browser`, where a new tab displays the PostgreSQL core documentation.
-   Click the `Save` button to save work.
-   Click the `Cancel` button to exit without saving work.
-   Click the `Reset` button to restore configuration parameters.
