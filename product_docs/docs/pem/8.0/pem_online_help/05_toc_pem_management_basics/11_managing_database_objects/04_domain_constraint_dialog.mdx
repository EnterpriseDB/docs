Use the `Domain Constraints` dialog to create or modify a domain constraint. A domain constraint confirms that the values provided for a domain meet a defined criteria. The `Domain Constraints` dialog implements options of the ALTER DOMAIN command.

The `Domain Constraints` dialog organizes the development of a domain constraint through the following dialog tabs: `General` and `Definition`. The `SQL` tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

Use the fields in the `General` tab to identify the domain constraint:

-   Use the `Name` field to add a descriptive name for the constraint. The name will be displayed in the `Browser` tree control.
-   Store notes about the constraint in the `Comment` field.

Click the `Definition` tab to continue.

![Create Domain Constraints dialog - Definition tab](../../images/domain_constraint_definition.png)

Use the fields in the `Definition` tab to define the domain constraint:

-   Use the `Check` field to provide a CHECK expression. A CHECK expression specifies a constraint that the domain must satisfy. A constraint must produce a Boolean result; include the key word VALUE to refer to the value being tested. Only those expressions that evaluate to TRUE or UNKNOWN will succeed. A CHECK expression cannot contain subqueries or refer to variables other than VALUE. If a domain has multiple CHECK constraints, they will be tested in alphabetical order.
-   Move the `Validate?` switch to the `No` position to mark the constraint NOT VALID. If the constraint is marked NOT VALID, the constraint will not be applied to existing column data. The default value is `Yes`.

Click the `SQL` tab to continue.

Your entries in the `Domain Constraints` dialog generate a SQL command (see an example below). Use the `SQL` tab for review; revisit or switch tabs to make any changes to the SQL command.

**Example**

The following is an example of the sql command generated by user selections in the `Domain Constraints` dialog:

The example shown demonstrates creating a domain constraint on the domain `timesheets` named `weekday`. It constrains a value to equal `Friday`.
