Use the `Rule` dialog to define or modify a rule for a specified table or view. A PostgreSQL rule allows you to define an additional action that will be performed when a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE is performed against a table.

The `Rule` dialog organizes the development of a rule through the `General`, `Definition`, `Condition`, `Commands` tabs. The `SQL` tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

Use the fields in the `General` tab to identify the rule:

-   Use the `Name` field to add a descriptive name for the rule. The name will be displayed in the `Browser` tree control. Multiple rules on the same table are applied in alphabetical name order.
-   Store notes about the rule in the `Comment` field.

Click the `Definition` tab to continue.

Use the fields in the `Definition` tab to write parameters:

-   Click inside the `Event` field to select the type of event that will invoke the rule; event may be `Select`, `Insert`, `Update`, or `Delete`.
-   Move the `Do Instead` switch to `Yes` indicate that the commands should be executed instead of the original command; if Do Instead specifies `No`, the rule will be invoked in addition to the original command.

Click the `Condition` tab to continue.

Specify a SQL conditional expression that returns a boolean value in the editor.

Click the `Commands` tab to continue.

Provide a command in the editor that defines the action performed by the rule.

Click the `SQL` tab to continue.

Your entries in the `Rule` dialog generate a SQL command (see an example below). Use the `SQL` tab for review; revisit or switch tabs to make any changes to the SQL command.

**Example**

The following is an example of the sql command generated by user selections in the `Rule` dialog:

The example sends a notification when an UPDATE executes against a table.

-   Click the `Info` button (i) to access online help. View context-sensitive help in the `Tabbed browser`, where a new tab displays the PostgreSQL core documentation.
-   Click the `Save` button to save work.
-   Click the `Cancel` button to exit without saving work.
-   Click the `Reset` button to restore configuration parameters.
