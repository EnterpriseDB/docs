Use the `Foreign key` dialog to specify the behavior of a foreign key constraint. A foreign key constraint maintains referential integrity between two tables. A foreign key constraint cannot be defined between a temporary table and a permanent table.

The `Foreign key` dialog organizes the development of a foreign key constraint through the following dialog tabs: `General`, `Definition`, `Columns`, and `Action`. The `SQL` tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

![Create Foreign Key dialog - General tab](../../images/foreign_key_general.png)

Use the fields in the `General` tab to identify the foreign key constraint:

-   Use the `Name` field to add a descriptive name for the foreign key. The name will be displayed in the `Browser` tree control.
-   Store notes about the foreign key constraint in the `Comment` field.

Click the `Definition` tab to continue.

![Create Foreign Key dialog - Definition tab](../../images/foreign_key_definition.png)

Use the fields in the `Definition` tab to define the foreign key constraint:

-   Move the `Deferrable?` switch to the `Yes` position to specify the timing of the constraint is deferrable and can be postponed until the end of the statement. The default is `No`.

-   If enabled, move the `Deferred?` switch to the `Yes` position to specify the timing of the constraint is deferred to the end of the statement. The default is `No`.

-   Move the `Match type` switch specify the type of matching that is enforced by the constraint:

    > -   Select `Full` to indicate that all columns of a multicolumn foreign key must be null if any column is null; if all columns are null, the row is not required to have a match in the referenced table.
    > -   Select `Simple` to specify that a single foreign key column may be null; if any column is null, the row is not required to have a match in the referenced table.

-   Move the `Validated` switch to the `Yes` position to instruct the server to validate the existing table content (against a foreign key or check constraint) when you save modifications to this dialog.

-   Move the `Auto FK Index` switch to the `No` position to disable the automatic index feature.

-   The field next to `Covering Index` generates the name of an index if the `Auto FK Index` switch is in the `Yes` position; or, this field is disabled.

Click the `Columns` tab to continue.

![Create Foreign Key dialog - Columns tab](../../images/foreign_key_columns.png)

Use the fields in the `Columns` tab to specify one or more reference column(s). A Foreign Key constraint requires that one or more columns of a table must only contain values that match values in the referenced column(s) of a row of a referenced table:

-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Local column` to specify the column in the current table that will be compared to the foreign table.
-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `References` to specify the name of the table in which the comparison column(s) resides.
-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Referencing` to specify a column in the foreign table.

Click the `Add` icon (+) to add a column to the list; repeat the steps above and click the `Add` icon (+) to add additional columns. To discard an entry, click the trash icon to the left of the entry and confirm deletion in the `Delete Row` popup.

Click the `Action` tab to continue.

![Create Foreign Key dialog - Action tab](../../images/foreign_key_action.png)

Use the drop-down listboxes on the `Action` tab to specify behavior related to the foreign key constraint that will be performed when data within the table is updated or deleted:

-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `On update` to select an action that will be performed when data in the table is updated.
-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `On delete` to select an action that will be performed when data in the table is deleted.

The supported actions are:

|             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NO ACTION   | Produce an error indicating that the deletion or update will create a foreign key constraint violation. If the constraint is deferred, this error will be produced at constraint check time if any referencing rows still exist. This is the default. |
| RESTRICT    | Throw an error indicating that the deletion or update would create a foreign key constraint violation. This is the same as NO ACTION except that the check is not deferrable.                                                                         |
| CASCADE     | Delete any rows referencing the deleted row, or update the values of the referencing column(s) to the new values of the referenced columns, respectively.                                                                                             |
| SET NULL    | Set the referencing column(s) to null.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| SET DEFAULT | Set the referencing column(s) to their default values. There must be a row in the referenced table that matches the default values (if they are not null), or the operation will fail.                                                                |

Click the `SQL` tab to continue.

Your entries in the `Foreign key` dialog generate a SQL command (see an example below). Use the `SQL` tab for review; revisit or switch tabs to make any changes to the SQL command.

**Example**

The following is an example of the sql command generated by user selections in the `Foreign key` dialog:

![Create Foreign Key dialog - SQL tab](../../images/foreign_key_sql.png)

The example shown demonstrates creating a foreign key constraint named `territory_fkey` that matches values in the `distributors` table `territory` column with those of the `sales_territories` table `region` column.
