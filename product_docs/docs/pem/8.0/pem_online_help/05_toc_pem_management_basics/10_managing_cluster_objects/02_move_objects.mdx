Use the `Move Objects` dialog to to move database objects from one tablespace to another tablespace.

The `Move Objects` dialog organizes the movement of database objects with the `General` tab; the `SQL` tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

Use the fields in the `General` tab to identify the items that will be moved and the tablespace to which they will be moved:

-   Use the `New tablespace` drop-down listbox to select a pre-existing tablespace to which the object will be moved. (To create a tablespace, use the `Tablespace` dialog; access the dialog by right clicking `Tablespaces` in the `Browser` tree control and selecting `Create Tablespace...` from the context-menu.)

-   Use the `Object type` drop-down listbox to select from the following:

    > -   Select `All` to move all tables, indexes, and materialized views from the current tablespace (currently selected in the `Browser` tree control) to the new tablespace.
    > -   Select `Tables` to move tables from the current tablespace to the new tablespace.
    > -   Select `Indexes` to move indexes from the current tablespace to the new tablespace.
    > -   Select `Materialized views` to move materialized views from the current tablespace to the new tablespace.

-   Use the `Object owner` drop-down listbox to select the role that owns the objects selected in the `Object type` field. This field is optional.

Click the `SQL` tab to continue.

Your entries in the `Move Objects` dialog generate a SQL command (see an example below). Use the `SQL` tab for review; revisit the `General` tab to modify the SQL command.

**Example**

The following is an example of the sql command generated by user selections in the `Move Objects` dialog:

The example shown demonstrates moving materialized views owned by Alice from tablespace `tbspace_01` to `tbspace_02`.
