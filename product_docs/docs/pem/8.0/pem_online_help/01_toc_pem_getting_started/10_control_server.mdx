If you provided a `Service ID` on the `Advanced` tab of the [Server](07_pem_define_connection/#pem_define_connection) property dialogue, the PEM server can control the database service process.

> -   If the PEM client is running on a Windows machine, it can control the postmaster service if you have sufficient access rights. In case of a remote server, the service name must be prepended by the machine name (e.g. PSE1pgsql-8.0).
> -   If the PEM client is running on a Unix machine, it can control processes running on the local machine if you have sufficient access rights. When executing service control functions, PEM will append status/start/stop keywords to the service name provided.
