<div id="pem_menu_bar" class="registered_link"></div>

The PEM menu bar provides access to commands and features that you can use to manage your database servers and the objects that reside on those servers. If an option is disabled:

-   The database server to which you are currently connected may not support the selected feature.
-   The selected menu option may not be valid for the current object (by design).
-   The role that you have used to connect to the server may have insufficient privileges to change the selected object.

Context-sensitive menus across the top of the PEM web interface allow you to customize your environment and provide access to the enterprise management features of PEM.
