<div id="pgagent_jobs" class="registered_link"></div>

pgAgent is a scheduling agent that runs and manages jobs; each job consists of steps and schedules.

To create or manage a job, use the Browser tree control to browse to the server on which the pgAgent database objects were created. The tree control will display a `pgAgent Jobs` node, under which currently defined jobs are displayed. To add a new job, right click on the `pgAgent Jobs` node, and select `Create pgAgent Job...` from the context menu.

When the pgAgent dialog opens, use the tabs on the `pgAgent Job` dialog to define the steps and schedule that make up a pgAgent job.

![Create pgAgent Job dialog - General tab](../images/pgagent_general.png)

Use the fields on the `General` tab to provide general information about a job:

> -   Provide a name for the job in the `Name` field.
>
> -   Move the `Enabled` switch to the `Yes` position to enable a job, or `No` to disable a job.
>
> -   Use the `Job Class` drop-down to select a class (for job categorization).
>
> -   Use the `Host Agent` field to specify the name of a machine that is running pgAgent to indicate that only that machine may execute the job. Leave the field blank to specify that any machine may perform the job.
>
>     !!! Note
>         It is not always obvious what value to specify for the Host Agent in order to target a job step to a specific machine. With pgAgent running on the required machines and connected to the scheduler database, you can use the following query to view the hostnames as reported by each agent:
>
>     ```
>     SELECT jagstation FROM pgagent.pga_jobagent
>     ```
>
>     Use the hostname exactly as reported by the query in the Host Agent field.
>
> -   Use the `Comment` field to store notes about the job.

![Create pgAgent Job dialog - Steps tab](../images/pgagent_steps.png)

Use the `Steps` tab to define and manage the steps that the job will perform. Click the Add icon (+) to add a new step; then click the compose icon (located at the left side of the header) to open the step definition dialog:

![Create pgAgent Job dialog - Steps tab - General tab](../images/pgagent_step_definition.png)

Use fields on the step definition dialog to define the step:

> -   Provide a name for the step in the `Name` field; please note that steps will be performed in alphanumeric order by name.
> -   Use the `Enabled` switch to include the step when executing the job (`True`) or to disable the step (`False`).
> -   Use the `Kind` switch to indicate if the job step invokes SQL code (`SQL`) or a batch script (`Batch`).
>
> > -   If you select `SQL`, use the `Code` tab to provide SQL code for the step.
> > -   If you select `Batch`, use the `Code` tab to provide the batch script that will be executed during the step.

!!! Note
    The fields `Connection type`, `Database` and `Connection string` are only applicable when `SQL` is selected because `Batch` cannot be run on remote servers.

-   Use the `Connection type` switch to indicate if the step is performed on a local server (`Local`) or on a remote host (`Remote`). If you specify a remote connection should be used for the step, the `Connection string` field will be enabled, and you must provide a libpq-style connection string.
-   Use the `Database` drop-down to select the database on which the job step will be performed.
-   Use the `Connection string` field to specify a libpq-style connection string to the remote server on which the step will be performed. For more information about writing a connection string, please see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq.html#libpq-connect).
-   Use the `On error` drop-down to specify the behavior of pgAgent if it encounters an error while executing the step. Select from:
    -   `Fail` - Stop the job if you encounter an error while processing this step.
    -   `Success` - Mark the step as completing successfully, and continue.
    -   `Ignore` - Ignore the error, and continue.

> -   Use the `Comment` field to provide a comment about the step.

![Create pgAgent Job dialog - Steps tab - Code tab](../images/pgagent_step_definition_code.png)

Use the context-sensitive field on the step definition dialog's `Code` tab to provide the SQL code or batch script that will be executed during the step:

> -   If the step invokes SQL code, provide one or more SQL statements in the `SQL query` field.
> -   If the step performs a batch script, provide the script in the `Script` field. If you are running on a Windows server, standard batch file syntax must be used. When running on a Linux server, any shell script may be used, provided that a suitable interpreter is specified on the first line (e.g. `#!/bin/sh`).

When you've provided all of the information required by the step, click the compose icon to close the step definition dialog. Click the add icon (+) to add each additional step, or select the `Schedules` tab to define the job schedule.

![Create pgAgent Job dialog - Schedules tab](../images/pgagent_schedules.png)

Click the Add icon (+) to add a schedule for the job; then click the compose icon (located at the left side of the header) to open the schedule definition dialog:

![Create pgAgent Job dialog - Schedules tab - General tab](../images/pgagent_schedule_definition.png)

Use the fields on the schedule definition tab to specify the days and times at which the job will execute.

> -   Provide a name for the schedule in the `Name` field.
> -   Use the `Enabled` switch to indicate that pgAgent should use the schedule (`Yes`) or to disable the schedule (`No`).
> -   Use the calendar selector in the `Start` field to specify the starting date and time for the schedule.
> -   Use the calendar selector in the `End` field to specify the ending date and time for the schedule.
> -   Use the `Comment` field to provide a comment about the schedule.

Select the `Repeat` tab to define the days on which the schedule will execute.

![Create pgAgent Job dialog - Schedules tab - Repeat tab](../images/pgagent_schedule_repeat.png)

Use the fields on the `Repeat` tab to specify the details about the schedule in a cron-style format. The job will execute on each date or time element selected on the `Repeat` tab.

Click within a field to open a list of valid values for that field; click on a specific value to add that value to the list of selected values for the field. To clear the values from a field, click the X located at the right-side of the field.

Use the fields within the `Days` box to specify the days on which the job will execute:

> -   Use the `Week Days` field to select the days on which the job will execute.
> -   Use the `Month Days` field to select the numeric days on which the job will execute. Specify the `Last Day` to indicate that the job should be performed on the last day of the month, irregardless of the date.
> -   Use the `Months` field to select the months in which the job will execute.

Use the fields within the `Times` box to specify the times at which the job will execute:

> -   Use the `Hours` field to select the hour at which the job will execute.
> -   Use the `Minutes` field to select the minute at which the job will execute.

Select the `Exceptions` tab to specify any days on which the schedule will `not` execute.

![Create pgAgent Job dialog - Schedules tab - Exceptions tab](../images/pgagent_schedule_exceptions.png)

Use the fields on the `Exceptions` tab to specify days on which you wish the job to not execute; for example, you may wish for jobs to not execute on national holidays.

Click the Add icon (+) to add a row to the exception table, then:

> -   Click within the `Date` column to open a calendar selector, and select a date on which the job will not execute. Specify `<Any>` in the `Date` column to indicate that the job should not execute on any day at the time selected.
> -   Click within the `Time` column to open a time selector, and specify a time on which the job will not execute. Specify `<Any>` in the `Time` column to indicate that the job should not execute at any time on the day selected.

When you've finished defining the schedule, you can use the `SQL` tab to review the code that will create or modify your job.

![Create pgAgent Job dialog - SQL tab](../images/pgagent_sql.png)

Click the `Save` button to save the job definition, or `Cancel` to exit the job without saving. Use the `Reset` button to remove your unsaved entries from the dialog.

After saving a job, the job will be listed under the `pgAgent Jobs` node of the browser tree control of the server on which it was defined. The `Properties` tab in the main PEM window will display a high-level overview of the selected job, and the `Statistics` tab will show the details of each run of the job.

![pgAgent Object Properties tab](../images/pgagent_properties.png)

To modify an existing job or to review detailed information about a job, right-click on a job name, and select `Properties` from the context menu.
