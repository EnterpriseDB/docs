Use the `RLS Policy` dialog to Create a Row Level Security Policy.

!!! Note
    If the Row Level Security is enabled at table level and no policy is created then by default `Deny Policy` is applied. That means, no rows are visible or can be modified for that table.

The `RLS Policy` dialog creates a Row Level Security Policy through the following dialog tabs: `General`, and `Commands`. The `SQL` tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

Use the fields in the `General` tab to define the RLS Policy:

-   Use the `Name` field to add a descriptive name for the RLS Policy. The name will be displayed in the `pgAdmin` tree control.
-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Role` to select the Role to which the RLS Policy is to be applied.
-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Type` to select the type of the policy.

Click the `Commands` tab to continue.

Use the fields in the `Commands` tab to define the RLS Policy:

-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Event` to select the command to which policy applies. Valid options are ALL, SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE. Default is ALL.
-   Use the `Using` field to add a SQL conditional expression returning boolean. This expression will be added to queries that refer to the table if row level security is enabled.
-   Use the `With check` field to add a SQL conditional expression returning boolean. This expression will be used in INSERT and UPDATE queries against the table if row level security is enabled.

Click the `SQL` tab to continue.

Your entries in the `RLS Policy` dialog generate a SQL command (see an example below). Use the `SQL` tab for review; revisit or switch tabs to make any changes to the SQL command.

## Example

The following is an example of the sql command generated by user selections in the `RLS Policy` dialog:

The example shown demonstrates creating a RLS Policy named `account_managers` that applies the Row Level Security on the `accounts` table.
