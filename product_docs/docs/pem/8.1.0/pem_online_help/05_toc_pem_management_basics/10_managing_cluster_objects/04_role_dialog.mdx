<div id="role_dialog" class="registered_link"></div>

Use the `Login/Group Role` dialog to define a role. A role may be an individual user (with or without login privileges) or a group of users. Note that roles defined at the cluster level are shared by all databases in the cluster.

The `Login/Group Role` dialog organizes the creation and management of roles through the following dialog tabs: `General`, *Definition*, `Privileges`, *Parameters*, and `Security`. The `SQL` tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

![Create Role dialog - General tab](../../images/role_general.png)

Use the fields on the `General` tab to identify the role.

-   Use the `Name` field to provide the name of the role. The name will be displayed in the tree control.
-   Provide a note about the role in the `Comments` field.

Click the `Definition` tab to continue.

![Create Role dialog - Definition tab](../../images/role_definition.png)

Use the `Definition` tab to set a password and configure connection rules:

-   Provide a password that will be associated with the role in the `Password` field.
-   Provide an expiration date for the password in the `Account Expires` field (the role does not expire). The expiration date is not enforced when a user logs in with a non-password-based authentication method.
-   If the role is a login role, specify how many concurrent connections the role can make in the `Connection Limit` field. The default value (`-1`) allows unlimited connections.

Click the `Privileges` tab to continue.

![Create Role dialog - Privileges tab](../../images/role_privileges.png)

Use the `Privileges` tab to grant privileges to the role.

-   Move the `Can login?` switch to the `Yes` position if the role has login privileges. The default value is `No`.
-   Move the `Superuser` switch to the `Yes` position if the role is a superuser within the database. The default value is `No`.
-   Move the `Create roles?` switch to the `Yes` position to specify whether a role is permitted to create roles. A role with this privilege can alter and drop roles. The default value is `No`.
-   Move the `Create databases` switch to the `Yes` position to control whether a role can create databases. The default value is `No`.
-   The `Update catalog?` switch is disabled until the role is given superuser privileges. Move the `Update catalogs?` switch to the `No` position to control whether a role can update catalogs. The default value is `Yes` when the `Superuser` switch is in the `Yes` position.
-   Move the `Inherit rights from the parent roles?` switch to the `No` position if a role does not inherit privileges. The default value is `Yes`.
-   Move the `Can initiate streaming replication and backups?` switch to the `Yes` position to control whether a role can initiate streaming replication or put the system in and out of backup mode. The default value is `No`.

![Create Role dialog - Membership tab](../../images/role_membership.png)

-   Specify members of the role in the `Role Membership` field. Click inside the `Roles` field to select role names from a drop down list. Confirm each selection by checking the checkbox to the right of the role name; delete a selection by clicking the `x` to the left of the role name. Membership conveys the privileges granted to the specified role to each of its members.

Click the `Parameters` tab to continue.

![create Role dialog - Parameters tab](../../images/role_parameters.png)

Use the fields on the `Parameters` tab to set session defaults for a selected configuration parameter when the role is connected to a specified database. This tab invokes the ALTER ROLE... SET configuration_parameter syntax. Click the `Add` icon (+) to assign a value for a parameter.

-   Use the drop-down listbox in the `Name` field to select a parameter.
-   Use the `Value` field to specify a value for the parameter.
-   Use the drop-down listbox in the `Database` field to select a database.

Click the `Add` icon (+) to specify each additional parameter; to discard a parameter, click the trash icon to the left of the row and confirm the deletion in the `Delete Row` popup.

Click the `Security` tab to continue.

![Create Role dialog - Security tab](../../images/role_security.png)

Use the `Security` tab to define security labels applied to the role. Click the `Add` icon (+) to add each security label selection.

-   Specify a security label provider in the `Provider` field. The named provider must be loaded and must consent to the proposed labeling operation.
-   Specify a a security label in the `Security Label` field. The meaning of a given label is at the discretion of the label provider. PostgreSQL places no restrictions on whether or how a label provider must interpret security labels; it merely provides a mechanism for storing them.

To discard a security label, click the trash icon to the left of the row and confirm the deletion in the `Delete Row` popup.

Click the `SQL` tab to continue.

Your entries in the `Login/Group Role` dialog generate a SQL command (see an example below). Use the `SQL` tab for review; revisit or switch tabs to make any changes to the SQL command.

**Example**

The following is an example of the sql command generated by user selections in the `Login/Group Role` dialog:

![Create Role dialog - SQL tab](../../images/role_sql.png)

The example creates a login role named `alice` with `pem_user` privileges; the role can make unlimited connections to the server at any given time.

-   Click the Info button (`i`) to access online SQL help.
-   Click the Help button (`?`) to access the documentation for the dialog.
-   Click the `Save` button to save work.
-   Click the `Cancel` button to exit without saving work.
-   Click the `Reset` button to restore configuration parameters.
