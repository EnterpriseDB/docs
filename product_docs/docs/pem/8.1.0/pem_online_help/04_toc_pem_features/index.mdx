Postgres Enterprise Manager offers a number of additional enterprise management features that will assist you in managing, analyzing, streamlining, and deploying Postgres functionality. PEM probes monitor managed servers, retrieving information that PEM then analyzes to create dashboards that display useful information and statistics about your hosts, servers and databases. PEM dialogs provide easy access to probe, server, and agent configurations so you can enable and customise the behaviour of PEM features.

-   [Dashboards](01_dashboards)
-   [Server Configuration](02_pem_server_config)

PEM configuration wizards simplify the process of configuring logging; after logs are gathered, you can use PEM features like the PEM Log Analysis Expert and Tuning Wizard to help you skillfully analyze log file contents. Postgres Expert analyses server configuration, and recommends changes that may improve performance, security, or reliability. Capacity Manager uses statistical data to analyze historical usage, and extrapolate future usage statistics for monitored objects.

PEM is highly customizable. You can modify system-defined alerts, or create custom alerts that notify a responsible administrator or group during a specific time period. PEM charts and dashboards are designed to provide an at-a-glance overview of the state of your systems, but you can design custom charts that display the most useful combinations of metric data returned by PEM probes. Then, create custom dashboards with details that `you` need to identify problems, plan for resource usage, or diagnose unique performance issues.

PEM can schedule jobs on monitored servers. you can use the wizards to schedule the setup to occur at a time when server usage is low, or when a system restart won't interrupt your users. The Scheduled Task tab provides an overview of all the tasks that are pending execution or that have recently completed on your servers. Performance diagnostic feature helps you analyze the database performance for Advanced Server instances by monitoring the wait events.
