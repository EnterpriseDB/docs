title: "Enable Kerberos Authentication"
---

PEM 8.1 onwards supports `Kerberos Authentication`. So you need to set up the Kerberos authentication at the time of configuring the PEM Server. For more details, see [PEM Installation Guides](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pem/latest).

## Principal and Keytab file for PEM Webserver (apache/HTTP) and PEM Backend Database

-   Add the `principal` and generate the `keytab` file for `PEM webserver` (apache/HTTP) and copy it to the machine where the PEM webserver resides. Ensure that the operating system user owning the `PEM Webserver` is the owner of this file and accessible by that user.
-   Add the `principal` and generate the `keytab` file for the `PEM backend database` server and copy it to the machine where the PEM backend database resides. Ensure that the operating system user owning the `PEM backend database` server data directory is the owner of this file and accessible by that user.

## Configuration settings

To enable Kerberos authentication for PEM, you must configure the following parameters in `config_setup.py` on the system where the PEM Server is installed.

-   `PEM_APP_HOST`- Specify the name of the `PEM Webserver Hostname`. Please note that if it is not set, then it will take the value of the `default_server` parameter.
-   `PEM_AUTH_METHOD`- Set the value to `kerberos` to use kerberos authentication.

## Browser settings to configure Kerberos Authentication

You need to do the browser settings on the client machine to use the `Spnego/Kerberos`.

-   For Mozilla Firefox
    -   Open the low level Firefox configuration page by loading the `about:config` page.
    -   In the Search text box, enter: `network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris`
    -   Double-click the `network.negotiate-auth.trusted-uris` preference and enter the hostname or the domain of the web server that is protected by Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO. Separate multiple domains and hostnames with a comma.
    -   Click OK.
-   For Google Chrome

    -   For Windows:

        -   Open the Control Panel to access the Internet Options dialog.
        -   Select the Security tab.
        -   Select the Local Intranet zone and click the Sites button.
        -   Make sure that the first two options, Include all local (intranet) sites not listed in other zones and Include all sites that bypass the proxy server are checked.
        -   Click Advanced and add the names of the domains that are protected by Kerberos HTTP SPNEGO, one at a time, to the list of websites. For example, myhost.example.com. Click Close.
        -   Click OK to save your configuration changes.

    -   For Linux or MacOS:

        -   Add the `--auth-server-whitelist` parameter to the google-chrome command. For example, to run Chrome from a Linux prompt, run the google-chrome command as follows:

        ```text
        google-chrome --auth-server-whitelist = "hostname/domain"
        ```
