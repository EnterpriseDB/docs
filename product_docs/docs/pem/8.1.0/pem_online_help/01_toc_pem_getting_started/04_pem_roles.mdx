You can use the `Login/Group Role` dialog to allow a role with limited privileges to access PEM features such as the Audit Manager, Capacity Manager, or SQL Profiler. PEM pre-defined roles allow access to PEM functionality; roles that are assigned membership in these roles can access the associated feature.

![Role dialog membership tab](../images/role_dialog_membership.png)

When defining a user, use the `Membership` tab to specify the roles in which the new user is a member. The new user will share the privileges associated with each role in which it is a member. For a user to have access to PEM extended functionality, the role must be a member of the pem_user role and the pre-defined role that grants access to the feature. Use the `Roles` field to select pre-defined role names from a drop down list.

Check the checkbox to the right of the role name to allow administrative access to the functionality.

The `SQL` tab displays the SQL command that the server will execute when you click `Save`.

![Role based membership example](../images/pem_roles_membership_example.png)

The examples shown above creates a login role named `acctg_clerk` that will have access to the Audit Manager; the role can make unlimited connections to the server at any given time.

You can use PEM pre-defined roles to allow access to the functionality listed in the table below:

!!! Note
    The difference between pem_admin role and pem_super_admin role is that a user with pem_admin role can view and manage only those objects where the role has been mentioned in the Team field under the server's properties, while a user with pem_super_admin role can view and manage all the objects within Postgres Enterprise Manager console.
