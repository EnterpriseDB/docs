title: "Upgrading the PEM Backend Postgres Database"
---

If you are updating both PEM components and the PEM backend database, you should perform PEM component updates (the server and Agent) before updating the backend database. For more information about updating PEM component software, see [Upgrading a PEM Installation](01_upgrading_pem_installation/#upgrading_pem_installation).

!!! Note
    From PEM 8.0 onwards, the PostgreSQL or EPAS version 11 or higher are only supported as backend database server. Hence if your backend database server is lower than version 11 then first you need to upgrade your backend database server and then upgrade the PEM components.

The update process described in this section uses the `pg_upgrade` utility to migrate from one version of the backend server to a more recent version. `pg_upgrade` facilitates migration between any supported version of Postgres, and any subsequent release of Postgres that is supported on the same platform.

!!! Note
    If the source PEM Server is lower than the 7.16 version, then you need to replace the following functions before you run `pg_upgrade`:

    -   The `abstime`, `reltime`, and `tinterval` datatypes are deprecated from Postgres version 12 or later, hence to replace those dataypes  with `timestamptz` data type use below command:

    ```text
    DO
    $$
    DECLARE
        rec record;
        cnt integer;
    BEGIN
        -- Check for the deprecated type in our user info probe
        SELECT count(*) INTO cnt
        FROM pem.probe_column
        WHERE sql_data_type = ‘abstime’ AND internal_name = ‘valuntil’;
            IF cnt = 0 THEN
                RETURN;
            END IF;
        ALTER TABLE pemdata.user_info
            ALTER COLUMN valuntil SET DATA TYPE timestamptz;
        ALTER TABLE pemhistory.user_info
            ALTER COLUMN valuntil SET DATA TYPE timestamptz;
        -- Now update the pem.probe_column itself
        UPDATE pem.probe_column
        SET sql_data_type = ‘timestamptz’
        WHERE sql_data_type = ‘abstime’ AND internal_name = ‘valuntil’;
    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE ‘plpgsql’;
    ```

    -   Replace the below function to avoid any alert errors:

    ```text
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pem.check_alert_params_array_size(
    template_id pem.alert_template.id%type, params text[]
    )
    RETURNS bool AS $FUNC$
    DECLARE
        res bool := TRUE;
    BEGIN
        /*
        * During restoring the pem database, it does not maintain the order while
        * inserting data in the table, and uses the sort table based on the
        * names.
        * Hence - we need to check the foreign key constraint is present before
        * validating these values.
        */
        IF EXISTS(
            SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.table_constraints
            WHERE constraint_name='alert_template_id_fkey' AND
            table_name='alert' AND table_schema='pem'
        ) THEN
      /*
       * Need to use the IS TRUE construct outside the main query, because
       * otherwise if there's no template by that ID then the query would return
       * 0 rows and the result of the function would be undefined and CHECK
       * constraint would succeed.
       * Probably this is being over-cautious, because pem.alert.template_id
       * references pem.alert_template.id. But the SQL standard (probably) does
       * not define the order in which the CHECK or the FOREIGN KEY constraints
       * should be validated; in case CHECK is validated first, we want it to
       * fail.
       */
    EXECUTE $SQL$
        SELECT (
            SELECT pem.check_array_size_equal(t.param_names, $2)
            FROM pem.alert_template AS t
            WHERE id = $1
        ) IS TRUE
      $SQL$ INTO res USING template_id, params;
    END IF;
     RETURN res;
    END
    $FUNC$ LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';
    ```

`pg_upgrade` supports a transfer of data between servers of the same type. For example, you can use `pg_upgrade` to move data from a PostgreSQL 9.6 backend database to a PostgreSQL 11 backend database, but not to an Advanced Server 11 backend database. If you wish to migrate to a different type of backend database (i.e from a PostgreSQL server to Advanced Server), see [Moving the Postgres Enterprise Manager Server](03_moving_pem_server).

You can find more information about using pg_upgrade at:

<http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/pgupgrade.html>

1.  Download and invoke the updated installer; installers for PostgreSQL and Advanced Server are available through the EDB website:

    <https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres>

    After downloading the installer for the server version to which you will be upgrading, invoke the installer on the host of the PEM server. Follow the onscreen instructions of the installation wizard to configure and install the Postgres server.

    You can optionally use a custom-built PostgreSQL server as a host of the PEM backend database. Note that if you are upgrading from a PostgreSQL backend database listening on port `5432`, the new server must be configured to listen on a different port.

2.  Configure SSL utilities on the new server. The new backend database must be running the same version of `sslutils` that the current backend database is running; you can download the SSL Utils package that is used in EDB installers at:

     <https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/modified-gpl-source-code>

     You are *not* required to manually add the `sslutils` extension when using the Advanced Server as the new backend database. The process of configuring `sslutils` is platform-specific.

    **On Linux**

    -   On an Advanced Server backend database, the sslutils extension is installed by default.

    -   If you are using a PostgreSQL as PEM backend database, ensure you have access to the PostgreSQL community repository, and use the command:

        ```text
        yum install sslutils_<X>
        ```

        Where `<X>` is the server version.

    -   If you are using a EDB one-click installer of PostgreSQL as PEM backend database

        ```text
         yum install gcc openssl-devel
        ```

        Set the value of PATH so it can locate the pg_config program

        ```text
         export PATH=$PATH:/opt/postgres_inst_dir/<X>/bin/
        ```

        Move into the sslutils folder, and enter

        ```text
         make USE_PGXS=1
         make USE_PGXS=1 install
        ```

        Use psql to create the sslutils extension

        ```text
         CREATE EXTENSION sslutils
        ```

        Please note that Debian 10 and Ubuntu 20 has increased the requirements to accept the certificates due to security reason. If a user wants to install the PEM Agent on any of the machines, they must upgrade `ssltuils` to 1.3 where 4096 bit RSA key and sha256 signature algorithm support has added.If the user does not upgrade `sslutils` to 1.3, then PEM Agent may fail to connect to the PEM backend database server, and it might log the error `ca md too weak`.

    **On Windows**

    -   `sslutils` must be compiled on the new backend database with the same compiler that was used to compile `sslutils` on the original backend database. If you are moving to a Postgres database that was installed using a PostgreSQL one-click installer (from EDB) or an Advanced Server installer, use Visual Studio to build `sslutils`. If you are upgrading to PostgreSQL 9.6 or later, use Visual Studio 2010.

        For detailed information about building a specific version of Postgres on Windows, please consult the core documentation for that version. Core documentation is available at the PostgreSQL project website at:

        <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/install-windows.html>

    -   While specific details of the process will vary by platform and compiler, the basic steps on each platform are the same. The example that follows demonstrates compiling OpenSSL support for PostgreSQL on a 32-bit Windows system.

        Before compiling the OpenSSL extension, you must locate and install OpenSSL for your version of Windows. Before invoking the OpenSSL installer you may be required to download and install a pre-requisite redistributable (such as `vcredist_x86.exe`).

        After installing OpenSSL, download and unpack the `sslutils` utility package available at:

        <https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/modified-gpl-source-code>

    -   Copy the unpacked `sslutils` folder to the Postgres installation directory (i.e. `C:\ProgramFiles\PostgreSQL\<x.x>`)

    -   Open the Visual Studio command line, and navigate into the `sslutils` directory. Use the following commands to build `sslutils`:

        ```text
        SET USE_PGXS=1

        SET GETTEXTPATH=\ <path_to_gettext>

        SET OPENSSLPATH=\ <path_to_openssl>

        SET PGPATH=\ <path_to_pg_installation_dir>

        SET ARCH=x86

        msbuild sslutils.proj /p:Configuration=Release
        ```

    Where:

    -   `path_to_gettext` specifies the location of the `GETTEXT` library and header files.

    -   `path_to_openssl` specifies the location of the openssl library and header files.

    -   `path_to_pg_installation_dir` specifies the location of the Postgres installation.

    -   For example, the following set of commands builds OpenSSL support into the PostgreSQL 11 server:

        ```text
        SET USE_PGXS=1

        SET OPENSSLPATH=C:\OpenSSL-Win32

        SET GETTEXTPATH="C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\11"

        SET PGPATH="C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\11"

        SET ARCH=x86

        msbuild sslutils.proj /p:Configuration=Release
        ```

    -   When the build completes, the `sslutils` directory will contain the following files:

        `sslutils--1.3.sql`

        `sslutils--unpackaged--1.3.sql`

        `sslutils--pemagent.sql.in`

        `sslutils.dll`

    -   Copy the compiled sslutils files to the appropriate directory for your installation; for example:

        ```text
        COPY sslutils*.sql "%PGPATH%\share\extension\"

        COPY sslutils.dll "%PGPATH%\lib\"

        COPY sslutils.control "%PGPATH%\share\extension\"
        ```

3.  Stop the services of both the old backend database and the new backend database.

    On RHEL or CentOS 7.x or 8.x, open a command line and assume the identity of a superuser. Enter the command:

    ```text
    systemctl <service_name> stop
    ```

    Where `<service_name>` specifies the name of the Postgres service.

    On Windows, you can use the `Services` dialog to control the service. To open the `Services` dialog, navigate through the `Control Panel` to the `System and Security` menu. Select `Administrative Tools`, and then double-click the `Services` icon. When the `Services` dialog opens, highlight the service name in the list, and use the option provided on the dialog to stop the service.

4.  Use the `pg_upgrade` utility to perform an in-place transfer of existing data between the old backend database and the new backend  database. If your server is configured to enforce `md5` authentication, you may need to add an entry to the `.pgpass` file that specifies the connection properties (and password) for the database superuser, or modify the `pg_hba.conf` file to allow trust connections before invoking `pg_upgrade`. For more information about creating an entry in the `.pgpass` file, please see the PostgreSQL core documentation, available at:

    <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-pgpass.html>

    During the upgrade process, pg_upgrade will write a series of log files. The cluster owner must invoke `pg_upgrade` from a directory in which they have write privileges. If the upgrade completes successfully, `pg_upgrade` will remove the log files when the upgrade completes. To instruct `pg_upgrade` to not delete the upgrade log files, include the `--retain` keyword when invoking `pg_upgrade`.

    To invoke `pg_upgrade`, assume the identity of the cluster owner, navigate into a directory in which the cluster owner has write privileges, and execute the command:

    ```text
    <path_to_pg_upgrade> pg_upgrade

    -d <old_data_dir_path>

    -D <new_data_dir_path>

    -b <old_bin_dir_path> -B <new_bin_dir_path>

    -p <old_port> -P <new_port>

    -u <user_name>
    ```

    Where:

    -   `path_to_pg_upgrade` specifies the location of the pg_upgrade utility. By default, pg_upgrade is installed in the `bin` directory under your Postgres directory.
    -   `old_data_dir_path` specifies the complete path to the data directory of the old backend database.
    -   `new_data_dir_path` specifies the complete path to the data directory of the new backend database.
    -   `old_bin_dir_path` specifies the complete path to the bin directory of the old backend database.
    -   `new_bin_dir_path` specifies the complete path to the bin directory of the old backend database.
    -   `old_port` specifies the port on which the old server is listening.
    -   `new_port` specifies the port on which the new server is listening.
    -   `user_name` specifies the name of the cluster owner.

    For example, the following command:

    ```text
    C:\>"C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\11\bin\pg_upgrade.exe"

    -d "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.6\data"

    -D "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\11\data"

    -b "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\9.6\bin"

    -B "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\11\bin"

    -p 5432 -P 5433

    -U postgres
    ```

    Instructs `pg_upgrade` to migrate the PEM database from PostgreSQL 9.6 to PostgreSQL 11 on a Windows system (if the backend databases are installed in their default locations).

    Once invoked, `pg_upgrade` will perform consistency checks before moving the data to the new backend database. When the upgrade is finished, `pg_upgrade` will notify you that the upgrade is complete.

    For detailed information about using `pg_upgrade` options, or troubleshooting the upgrade process, please see:

    <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/pgupgrade.html>

5.  Copy the following certificate files from the `data` directory of the old backend database to the `data` directory of the new backend database:

    `ca_certificate.crt`

    `ca_key.key`

    `root.crt`

    `root.crl`

    `server.key`

    `server.crt`

    Once in place on the target server, the files should have the (platform-specific) permissions described below:

    **Permissions and Ownership on Linux**

    | **File Name**      | **Owner** | **Permissions** |
    | ------------------ | --------- | --------------- |
    | ca_certificate.crt | postgres  | -rw-------      |
    | ca_key.key         | postgres  | -rw-------      |
    | root.crt           | postgres  | -rw-------      |
    | root.crl           | postgres  | -rw-------      |
    | server.key         | postgres  | -rw-------      |
    | server.crt         | postgres  | -rw-r--r--      |

    On Linux, the certificate files must be owned by `postgres`. You can use the following command at the command line to modify the ownership of the files:

    ```text
    chown postgres <file_name>
    ```

    Where `file_name` specifies the name of the certificate file.

    The `server.crt` file may only be modified by the owner of the file, but may be read by any user. You can use the following command to set the file permissions for the `server.crt` file:

    ```text
    chmod 644 server.crt
    ```

    The other certificate files may only be modified or read by the owner of the file. You can use the following command to set the file permissions:

    ```text
    chmod 600 <file_name>
    ```

    Where `file_name` specifies the name of the file.

    **Permissions and Ownership on Windows**

    On Windows, the certificate files moved from the source host must be owned by the service account that performed the PEM server and backend database installation on the target host. If you invoked the PEM server and Postgres installer using the `Run as Administrator` option (selected from the context menu of the installer), the owner of the certificate files will be `Administrators`.

    To review and modify file permissions on Windows, right-click on the file name, and select `Properties`.

    ![The Security tab](../images/upgrade_backendDB_permission_Windows_security.png)
    ** The Security tab **

    Navigate to the `Security` tab and highlight a `Group or user name` to view the assigned permissions. Select `Edit` or `Advanced` to access dialogs that allow you to modify the permissions associated with the selected user.


6.  The `postgresql.conf` file contains parameter settings that specify server behavior. You will need to modify the `postgresql.conf` file on the new server to match the configuration specified in the `postgresql.conf` file of the old server.

    By default, the `postgresql.conf` file is located:

    -   For Postgres version lower than 10 on Linux, in `/opt/PostgreSQL/<X>/data`
    -   For Postgres version 10 or higher when installed with graphical installers on Linux, in `/opt/PostgreSQL/<X>/data`
    -   For Postgres version 10 or higher when installed with an RPM on Linux, in `/usr/pgsql/<X>/data`
    -   For any Postgres version on Windows, in `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<X>\data`

    Where, `<X>` is the version of Postgres on your system.

    Use your choice of editor to update the `postgresql.conf` file of the new server. Modify the following parameters:

    -   The `port` parameter to listen on the port monitored by your original backend database (typically, `5432`).
    -   The `ssl` parameter should be set to `on`.

    You must also ensure that the following parameters are enabled. If the parameters are commented out, remove the pound sign from in front of each `postgresql.conf` file entry:

    -   `ssl_cert_file = 'server.crt' # (change requires restart)`
    -   `ssl_key_file = 'server.key' # (change requires restart)`
    -   `ssl_ca_file = 'root.crt' # (change requires restart)`
    -   `ssl_crl_file = 'root.crl'`

    Your installation may have other parameter settings that require modification to ensure that the new backend database behaves in a manner comparable to the old backend database. Review the `postgresql.conf` files carefully to ensure that the configuration of the new server matches the configuration of the old server.

7.  The `pg_hba.conf` file contains parameter settings that specify how the server will enforce host-based authentication. When you install the PEM server, the installer modifies the `pg_hba.conf` file, adding entries to the top of the file:

    `# Adding entries for PEM Agens and admins to connect to PEM server`

    `hostssl pem +pem_user 192.168.2.0/24 md5`

    `hostssl pem +pem_agent 192.168.2.0/24 cert`

    `# Adding entries (localhost) for PEM Agens and admins to connect to PEM server`

    `hostssl pem +pem_user 127.0.0.1/32 md5`

    `hostssl postgres +pem_user 127.0.0.1/32 md5`

    `hostssl pem +pem_user 127.0.0.1/32 md5`

    `hostssl pem +pem_agent 127.0.0.1/32 cert`

    By default, the `pg_hba.conf` file is located at the following location:

    -   For Postgres version lower than 10 on Linux, in `/opt/PostgreSQL/<X>/data`
    -   For Postgres version 10 or higher when installed with graphical installers on Linux, in `/Opt/PostgreSQL/<X>/data`
    -   For Postgres version 10 or higher when installed with RPMs on Linux, in `/var/lib/pgsql/<X>/data`
    -   For Advanced Server version 10 or higher when installed with RPMs on Linux, in `/var/lib/edb/as<X>/data`
    -   For any Postgres version on Windows, in `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<X>\data`

    Where, `<X>` is the version of Postgres on your system.

    Using your editor of choice, copy the entries from the `pg_hba.conf` file of the old server to the `pg_hba.conf` file for the new server.

8.  Restart the service of the new backend database.

    On RHEL or CentOS 7.x or 8.x, open a command line and assume the identity of a superuser. Enter the command:

    ```text
    systemctl stop <service_name>
    ```

    Where `service_name` is the name of the backend database server.

    If you are using Windows, you can use the `Services` dialog to control the service. To open the `Services` dialog, navigate through the `Control Panel` to the `System and Security` menu. Select `Administrative Tools`, and then double-click the `Services` icon. When the `Services` dialog opens, highlight the service name in the list, and use the option provided on the dialog to start the service.
