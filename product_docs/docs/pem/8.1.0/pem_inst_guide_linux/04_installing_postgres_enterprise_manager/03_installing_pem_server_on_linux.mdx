title: 'Installing the PEM Server on Linux Platforms'

Before following the detailed instructions that install the PEM server on your specific platform, you must perform the prerequisite steps detailed in [Prerequisites for installing PEM Server](01_prerequisites_for_installing_pem_server/#prerequisites_for_installing_pem_server).

## Installing the PEM Server on a CentOS or RHEL Host

On a CentOS or RHEL system, you can use the `yum` package manager or `dnf` command to install a PEM Server; the installation tool you use will be dependent on the version of the host operating system. Before installing the server, you must ensure that your system contains the required prerequisite software listed below.

**Install Version-Specific Software**

Follow the version-specific instructions listed below to prepare your host system.

-   On a CentOS or RHEL 7.x host:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

-   On a CentOS or RHEL 8.x host:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
    ```

!!! Note
    You may need to enable the `[extras]` repository definition in the `CentOS-Base.repo` file (located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`).

**If you are a Red Hat Network user**

You must enable the `rhel-<x>-server-extras-rpms` repository, where `x` specifies the RHEL version.

You must also enable the `rhel-<x>-server-optional-rpms` repository to use EPEL packages, where *x* specifies the RHEL version. You can make the repository accessible by enabling the `RHEL optional subchannel` for `RHN-Classic`. If you have a certificate-based subscription, then you must also enable `rhel-<x>-server-eus-optional-rpms` repository to use EPEL packages; please see the `Red Hat Subscription Management Guide` for more information about the required repositories.

**Install and Configure the edb.repo File**

To create an EnterpriseDB repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

```text
yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`. After creating the `edb.repo` file, use the following command to replace the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the `<username>` and `<password>` of a registered EDB user:

```text
sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
```

**Install the PEM Server**

After meeting the platform-specific prerequisites listed above, you can use yum or dnf to install the PEM Server:

-   On CentOS or RHEL 7.x or 8.x, you can use `yum` to install the PEM server :

    ```text
    yum install edb-pem
    ```

-   On CentOS or RHEL 8.x, you can use `dnf` to install the PEM Server:

    ```text
    dnf install edb-pem
    ```

If you are doing a fresh installation of the PEM Server on a CentOS or RHEL 7.x host, the installer will also install `edb-python3-mod_wsgi` packages along with the installation as per requirement of the operating system.

If you are upgrading the PEM Server on a CentOS or RHEL 7.x host, the `mod_wsgi system` package will be replaced by the `edb-python3-mod_wsgi` package as per the requirement of the operating system.

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

If you want to install PEM server on a machine that is in isolated network, you must first create PEM repository on that machine. For more information about creating PEM repository on an isolated network, see [Creating a PEM repository in an Isolated Network](04_creating_pem_repository_in_isolated_network/#creating_pem_repository_in_isolated_network).

After installing PEM Server using `yum` or `dnf`, you need to configure the PEM Server. For more detailed information see [Configuring the PEM Server on Linux platforms](05_configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux/#configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux).

## Installing the PEM Server on a Debian or Ubuntu Host

The following steps will walk you through using the EDB `apt` repository to install a Debian package.

!!! Note
    You can also visit <https://repos.enterprisedb.com/> and select the platform and product to view the steps for installation.

1.  Log in as root on your Debian or Ubuntu host:

    ```text
    sudo su -
    ```

2.  Configure the EDB repository:

    -   For Debian 9:

        ```text
        sh -c 'echo "deb https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com $(lsb_release - cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
        ```

    Where `username:password` is to be replaced by the credentials provided by EDB.

    -   For Debian 10:

        a.  Set up the EnterpriseDB repository:

        ```text
        sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
        ```

        b.  Substitute your EnterpriseDB credentials for the `<username>` and `<password>` placeholders in the following command:

        ```text
        sh -c 'echo "machine apt.enterprisedb.com login <username> password <password>" > /etc/apt/auth.conf.d/edb.conf'
        ```

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

    ```text
    apt-get install apt-transport-https
    ```

4.  Add the EBD signing key:

    ```text
    wget -q -O -https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add â€“``
    ```

5.  Update the repository metadata:

    ```text
    apt-get update
    ```

6.  Use the following command to install the Debian package for the PEM server:

    ```text
    apt-get install edb-pem
    ```

When the installation completes, you must configure the PEM Server. For detailed information see [Configuring the PEM Server on Linux Platforms](05_configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux/#configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux).

## Installing the PEM Server on a SLES Host

Use the following command to add the EDB repository configuration files to your SLES host:

```text
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo
```

The command creates a repository configuration file named `edb.repo` in the `/etc/zypp/repos.d` directory. Modify the repository configuration file, adding the username and password of a registered EDB user.

Before installing PEM, you must install prerequisite packages. Invoke the following commands, replacing *sp_no* with the service pack that you are using (i.e. SP4):

```text
SUSEConnect -p sle-module-legacy/12/x86_64

SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12/x86_64

zypper addrepo  https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache:Modules/SLE_12_<sp_no>/Apache:Modules.repo

zypper addrepo http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Cloud:/OpenStack:/Newton:/cisco-apic:/2.3.1/SLE_12_<sp_no>/ pem_opensuse_boost
```

Then, refresh the repository and install the PEM server:

```text
zypper refresh

zypper install edb-pem
```

After installing PEM Server using `zypper`, you must configure the PEM Server. For detailed information see [Configuring the PEM Server on Linux Platforms](05_configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux/#configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux).
