A PEM Agent may monitor one or more servers on one or more hosts. For comprehensive information about managing a PEM Agent, see the [PEM Agent User Guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pem/latest/pem_agent/).

## Installing a PEM Agent on a CentOS or RHEL Host

On a CentOS or RHEL system, you can use the `yum` package manager or `dnf` command to install a PEM Agent; the installation tool you use will be dependent on the version of the host operating system. Before installing the agent, you must ensure that your system contains the required prerequisite software listed below.

**Install Platform-Specific Software**

-   On a CentOS or RHEL 7.x host:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

-   On a CentOS or RHEL 8.x host:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
    ```

!!! Note
    You may need to enable the `[extras]` repository definition in the `CentOS-Base.repo` file (located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`).

**If you are a Red Hat Network user**

You must enable the `rhel-<x>-server-extras-rpms` repository, where `x` specifies the RHEL version.

You must also enable the `rhel-<x>-server-optional-rpms` repository to use EPEL packages, where *x* specifies the RHEL version. You can make the repository accessible by enabling the `RHEL optional subchannel` for `RHN-Classic`. If you have a certificate-based subscription, then you must also enable `rhel-<x>-server-eus-optional-rpms` repository to use EPEL packages; please see the `Red Hat Subscription Management Guide` for more information about the required repositories.

**Install and Configure the edb.repo File**

To create an EnterpriseDB repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

```text
yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`. After creating the `edb.repo` file, use the following command to replace the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the &lt;username> and &lt;password> of a registered EDB user:

```text
sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
```

**Installing the PEM Agent**

-   Use the `yum install` command to install the PEM Agent on CentOS or RHEL 7.x or 8.x:

    ```text
    yum install edb-pem-agent
    ```

-   Also, you can use `dnf` command to install the PEM Agent on CentOS or RHEL 8.x:

    ```text
    dnf install edb-pem-agent
    ```

When the installation is complete, you can review a list of the installed packages and dependencies.

![](../../images/pem_rpm_installation_agent.png)

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

After installing PEM Agent using `yum` or `dnf`, you need to register the PEM Agent. For detailed information see [Registering a PEM Agent](09_registering_a_pem_agent/#registering-a-pem-agent).

## Installing a PEM Agent on a Debian or Ubuntu Host

To install PEM on a Debian or Ubuntu host, you must have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, [contact EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request) .

The following steps will walk you through using the EDB apt repository to install a Debian package. When using the commands, replace the username and password with the credentials provided by EDB.

1.  Log in as root:

    ```text
    sudo su -
    ```

2.  Configure the EDB repository:

    -   For Debian 9:

        ```text
        sh -c 'echo "deb https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com $(lsb_release - cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
        ```

    Where `username:password` is to be replaced by the credentials provided by EDB.

    -   For Debian 10:

        a.  Set up the EnterpriseDB repository:

        ```text
        sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
        ```

        b.  Substitute your EnterpriseDB credentials for the `username` and `password` placeholders in the following command:

        ```text
        sh -c 'echo "machine apt.enterprisedb.com login <username> password <password>" > /etc/apt/auth.conf.d/edb.conf'
        ```

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

    ```text
    apt-get install apt-transport-https
    ```

4.  Add the EBD signing key:

    ```text
    wget -q -O -https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add â€“
    ```

5.  Update the repository metadata:

    ```text
    apt-get update
    ```

6.  Use the following command to install the Debian package for the PEM Agent:

    ```text
    apt-get install edb-pem-agent
    ```

After installing PEM Agent using `apt-get`, you need to register the PEM Agent. For more detailed information see [Registering a PEM Agent](09_registering_a_pem_agent/#registering-a-pem-agent).

## Installing a PEM Agent on a SLES Host

Use the following command to add the EDB repository configuration files to your SLES host:

```text
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo
```

The command creates a repository configuration file named `edb.repo` in the `/etc/zypp/repos.d` directory. Modify the repository configuration file, adding the username and password of a registered EDB user.

Before installing PEM, you must install prerequisite packages. Use the following commands replacing *sp_no* with the service pack that you are using (i.e. SP2 or SP3):

```text
SUSEConnect -p sle-module-legacy/12/x86_64

SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12/x86_64

zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache:Modules/SLE_12_<sp_no>/Apache:Modules.repo

zypper addrepo http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Cloud:/OpenStack:/Newton:/cisco-apic:/2.3.1/SLE_12_<sp_no>/ pem_opensuse_boost
```

Then, you can refresh the repository and add a PEM agent:

```text
zypper refresh

zypper install edb-pem-agent
```

After installing the PEM Agent, you must register the agent. For more detailed information see [Registering a PEM Agent](09_registering_a_pem_agent/#registering-a-pem-agent).
