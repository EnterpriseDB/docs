title: "Registering a PEM Agent"
---

Each PEM Agent must be *registered* with the PEM Server. The registration process provides the PEM server with the information it needs to communicate with the Agent. You can use the `pemworker` utility to register the Agent if you use the package to install a PEM Agent.

The PEM Agent package places the PEM Agent in the `/usr/edb/pem/agent/bin` directory. To register an Agent, include the `--register-agent` keywords along with registration details when invoking the `pemworker` utility:

```text
pemworker --register-agent
```

Append command line options to the command string when invoking the pemworker utility. Each option should be followed by a corresponding value:

| Option                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

If you want to use any PEM feature for which a database server `restart` is required by the pemagent (such as Audit Manager, Log Manager, or the Tuning Wizard), then you must set the value for `allow_server_restart` to `true` in the `agent.cfg` file.

!!! Note
    When configuring a shell/batch script run by a PEM Agent that has PEM version 7.11 or later installed, the user for the `batch_script_user parameter` must be specified. It is strongly recommended that a non-root user is used to run the scripts. Using the root user may result in compromising the data security and operating system security. However, if you want to restore the `pemagent` to its original settings using the `root` user to run the scripts, then the `batch_script_user` parameter value must be set to `root`.

Before any changes are made on the PEM database, the connecting agent is authenticated with the PEM database server. When invoking the `pemworker` utility, you must provide the password associated with the PEM server administrative user role (`postgres`). There are three ways to specify the administrative password; you can:

-   set the `PEM_MONITORED_SERVER_PASSWORD` environment variable.
-   provide the password on the command line with the `PGPASSWORD` keyword.
-   create an entry in the `.pgpass` file.

Failure to provide the password will result in a password authentication error; you will be prompted for any other required but omitted information. When the registration is complete, the server will confirm that the Agent has been successfully registered.

**Setting PEM Agent Configuration Parameters**

The PEM Agent native package creates a sample configuration file named `agent.cfg.sample` in the `/usr/edb/pem/agent/etc` directory. When you register the PEM Agent, the `pemworker` program creates the actual Agent configuration file (named `agent.cfg`). Modify the `agent.cfg` file, changing the following configuration parameter value to `true`:

`heartbeat_connection = true`

By default, `heartbeat_connection` value is `false` but you can override the value during pemagent registration with `pemworker` utility using the `--enable-heartbeat-connection` option.

Then, use a platform-specific command to start the PEM Agent service;

On a CentOS or RHEL 7.x or 8.x host, use `systemctl` to start the service:

```text
systemctl start pemagent
```

The service will confirm that it is starting the Agent; when the Agent is registered and started, it will be displayed on the `Global Overview` and in the `Object browser` of the PEM web interface.
