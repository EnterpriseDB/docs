## PEM Probes – Reference

A probe is a scheduled task that retrieves information about the database objects that are being monitored by the PEM agent. PEM uses the collected information to build the graphs displayed on each dashboard. The Manage Probes tab (accessed via the Management menu) allows you to modify the data collection schedule and the length of time that PEM will retain information returned by a specific probe.

## PEM Pre-defined Alert Templates – Reference

An alert definition contains a system-defined or user-defined set of conditions that PEM compares to the system statistics; if the statistics deviate from the boundaries specified for that statistic, the alert triggers, and the PEM client displays a warning on the \*Alerts Overview\* page, and optionally sends a notification to a monitoring user.

The tables that follow list the system-defined alert templates that you can use to create an alert; please note that this list is subject to change, and may vary by system:
