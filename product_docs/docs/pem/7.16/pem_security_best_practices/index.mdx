title: "PEM Security Guide"
---

This document provides information about security practices you should consider when configuring PEM. PEM functionality does not require you to enforce these practices; however, EDB recommends these practices to enhance the overall systemâ€™s security.

PEM is dependent on third-party components from the vendor repository, including the Apache web server, OpenSSL, snmp++, libcurl, etc. To ensure these components are up to date, you should update your operating system and regularly apply security updates to avoid any security vulnerability. Without the most recent security patches, your system is potentially vulnerable to cyberattacks. Security patches protect your devices and their data by applying the latest updates to guard against the latest threats.

Some of the benefits of regularly applying security patches include:

-   Reduced exposure to cyberattacks
-   Avoiding lost productivity
-   Data protection from malware (like ransomware)
-   Avoid worm infections that use security loopholes to spread over the network
