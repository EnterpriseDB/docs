title: "Using the PEM Web Interface"
---

The PEM web interface is installed with the PEM server. When the server installation completes, you can open the PEM interface in your choice of browser by navigating to:

   `https://<ip_address_of_PEM_host>:8443/pem`

Where `ip_address_of_PEM_host` specifies the IP address of the host of the PEM server. The Postgres Enterprise Manager Login window opens:

![The PEM Login](../../images/pem_logon.png)

Use the fields on the `Postgres Enterprise Manager Login` window to authenticate yourself with the PEM server:

-  Provide the name of a pem database user in the `Username` field. For the first user connecting, this will be the name provided when installing the PEM server.

-  Provide the password associated with the user in the `Password` field.

After providing your credentials, click `Login` to connect to PEM.

The PEM web interface opens, displaying the `Global Overview` Dashboard.

![The Global Overview](../../images/global_overview.png)

The `Browser` pane displays a tree control that provides access to information about the database objects that reside on each server. The tree control expands to display a hierarchical view of the servers and objects that are monitored by the PEM server.

## The PEM Menu Bar

The PEM menu bar provides access to commands and features that you can use to manage your database servers and the objects that reside on those servers. If an option is disabled:

-  The database server to which you are currently connected may not support the selected feature.

-  The selected menu option may not be valid for the current object (by design).

-  The role that you have used to connect to the server may have insufficient privileges to change the selected object.

Context-sensitive menus across the top of the PEM web interface allow you to customize your environment and provide access to the enterprise management features of PEM.
