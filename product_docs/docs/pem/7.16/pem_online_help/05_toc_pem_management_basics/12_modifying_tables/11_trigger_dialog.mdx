Use the `Trigger` dialog to create a trigger or modify an existing trigger. A trigger executes a specified function when certain events occur.

The `Trigger` dialog organizes the development of a trigger through the following dialog tabs: `General`, *Definition*, `Events`, and `Code`. The `SQL` tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

![Create Trigger dialog - General tab](../../images/trigger_general.png)

Use the fields in the `General` tab to identify the trigger:

-   Use the `Name` field to add a descriptive name for the trigger. This must be distinct from the name of any other trigger for the same table. The name will be displayed in the `Browser` tree control. Note that if multiple triggers of the same kind are defined for the same event, they will be fired in alphabetical order by name.
-   Store notes about the trigger in the `Comment` field.

Click the `Definition` tab to continue.

![Create Trigger dialog - Definition tab](../../images/trigger_definition.png)

Use the fields in the `Definition` tab to define the trigger:

-   Move the `Row trigger?` switch to the `No` position to disassociate the trigger from firing on each row in a table. The default is `Yes`.
-   Move the `Constraint trigger?` switch to the `Yes` position to specify the trigger is a constraint trigger.
-   If enabled, move the `Deferrable?` switch to the `Yes` position to specify the timing of the constraint trigger is deferrable and can be postponed until the end of the statement. The default is `No`.
-   If enabled, move the `Deferred?` switch to the `Yes` position to specify the timing of the constraint trigger is deferred to the end of the statement causing the triggering event. The default is `No`.
-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Trigger Function` to select a trigger function or procedure.
-   Use the `Arguments` field to provide an optional (comma-separated) list of arguments to the function when the trigger is executed. The arguments are literal string constants.

-   `Trigger enabled` field is available in trigger dialog once the trigger is created. You can select one of the four options available.

Click the `Events` tab to continue.

![Create Trigger dialog - Events tab](../../images/trigger_events.png)

Use the fields in the `Events` tab to specify how and when the trigger fires:

-   Use the drop-down listbox next to the `Fires` fields to determine if the trigger fires `BEFORE` or `AFTER` a specified event. The default is `BEFORE`.
-   Select the type of event(s) that will invoke the trigger; to select an event type, move the switch next to the event to the `YES` position. The supported event types are `INSERT`, *UPDATE*, `DELETE`, and `TRUNCATE`.
-   Use the `When` field to provide a boolean condition that will invoke the trigger.
-   If defining a column-specific trigger, use the `Columns` field to specify the columns or columns that are the target of the trigger.

Click the `Code` tab to continue.

![Create Trigger dialog - Code tab](../../images/trigger_code.png)

Use the `Code` field to specify any additional code that will be invoked when the trigger fires.

Click the `SQL` tab to continue.

Your entries in the `Trigger` dialog generate a SQL command (see an example below). Use the `SQL` tab for review; revisit or switch tabs to make any changes to the SQL command.

**Example**

The following is an example of the sql command generated by user selections in the `Trigger` dialog:

The example demonstrates creating a trigger named `log_update` that calls a procedure named `log_account_update` that logs any updates to the `distributors` table.
