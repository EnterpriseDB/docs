Use the `Primary key` dialog to create or modify a primary key constraint. A primary key constraint indicates that a column, or group of columns, uniquely identifies rows in a table. This requires that the values in the selected column(s) be both unique and not null.

The `Primary key` dialog organizes the development of a primary key constraint through the `General` and `Definition` tabs. The `SQL` tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

Use the fields in the `General` tab to identify the primary key:

-   Use the `Name` field to add a descriptive name for the primary key constraint. The name will be displayed in the `Browser` tree control.

Click the `Definition` tab to continue.

Use the fields in the `Definition` tab to define the primary key constraint:

-   Click inside the `Columns` field and select one or more column names from the drop-down listbox. To delete a selection, click the `x` to the left of the column name. The primary key constraint should be different from any unique constraint defined for the same table; the selected column(s) for the constraints must be distinct.
-   Use `Include columns` field to specify columns for `INCLUDE` clause of the index. This option is available in Postgres 11 and later.
-   Select the name of the tablespace in which the primary key constraint will reside from the drop-down listbox in the `Tablespace` field.
-   Select the name of an index from the drop-down listbox in the `Index` field. This field is optional. Adding a primary key will automatically create a unique B-tree index on the column or group of columns listed in the primary key, and will force the column(s) to be marked NOT NULL.
-   Use the `Fill Factor` field to specify a fill factor for the table and index. The fill factor for a table is a percentage between 10 and 100. 100 (complete packing) is the default.
-   Move the `Deferrable?` switch to the `Yes` position to specify the timing of the constraint is deferrable and can be postponed until the end of the statement. The default is `No`.
-   If enabled, move the `Deferred?` switch to the `Yes` position to specify the timing of the constraint is deferred to the end of the statement. The default is `No`.

Click the `SQL` tab to continue.

Your entries in the `Primary key` dialog generate a SQL command (see an example below). Use the `SQL` tab for review; revisit or switch tabs to make any changes to the SQL command.

**Example**

The following is an example of the sql command generated by user selections in the `Primary key` dialog:

The example shown demonstrates creating a primary key constraint named `dept_pkey` on the `dept_id` column of the `dept` table.
