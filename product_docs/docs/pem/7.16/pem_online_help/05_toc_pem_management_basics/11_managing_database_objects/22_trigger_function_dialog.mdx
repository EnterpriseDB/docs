Use the `Trigger function` dialog to create or manage a trigger_function. A trigger function defines the action that will be invoked when a trigger fires.

The `Trigger function` dialog organizes the development of a trigger function through the following dialog tabs: `General`, *Definition*, `Code`, *Options*, *Parameters* and `Security`. The `SQL` tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

![Create Trigger Function dialog - General tab](../../images/trigger_function_general.png)

Use the fields in the `General` tab to identify the trigger function:

-   Use the `Name` field to add a descriptive name for the trigger function. The name will be displayed in the `Browser` tree control. Please note that trigger functions will be invoked in alphabetical order.
-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Owner` to select the role that will own the trigger function.
-   Select the name of the schema in which the trigger function will reside from the drop-down listbox in the `Schema` field.
-   Store notes about the trigger function in the `Comment` field.

Click the `Definition` tab to continue.

![Create Trigger Function dialog - Definition tab](../../images/trigger_function_definition.png)

Use the fields in the `Definition` tab to define the trigger function:

-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Return type` to specify the pseudotype that is associated with the trigger function:

    > -   Select `trigger` if you are creating a DML trigger.
    > -   Select `event_trigger` if you are creating a DDL trigger.

-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Language` to select the implementation language. The default is `plpgsql`.

Click the `Code` tab to continue.

![Create Trigger Function dialog - Code tab](../../images/trigger_function_code.png)

-   Use the `Code` field to write the code that will execute when the trigger function is called.

Click the `Options` tab to continue.

![Create Trigger Function dialog - Options tab](../../images/trigger_function_options.png)

Use the fields in the `Options` tab to describe or modify the action of the trigger function:

-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Volatility` to select one of the following:

    > -   `VOLATILE` indicates that the trigger function value can change even within a single table scan.
    > -   `STABLE` indicates that the trigger function cannot modify the database, and that within a single table scan it will consistently return the same result for the same argument values.
    > -   `IMMUTABLE` indicates that the trigger function cannot modify the database and always returns the same result when given the same argument values.

-   Move the `Returns a Set?` switch to indicate if the trigger function returns a set that includes multiple rows. The default is `No`.

-   Move the `Strict?` switch to indicate if the trigger function always returns NULL whenever any of its arguments are NULL. If `Yes`, the function is not executed when there are NULL arguments; instead a NULL result is assumed automatically. The default is `No`.

-   Move the `Security of definer?` switch to specify that the trigger function is to be executed with the privileges of the user that created it. The default is `No`.

-   Move the `Window?` switch to indicate that the trigger function is a window function rather than a plain function. The default is `No`. This is currently only useful for trigger functions written in C.

-   Use the `Estimated cost` field to specify a positive number representing the estimated execution cost for the trigger function, in units of cpu_operator_cost. If the function returns a set, this is the cost per returned row.

-   Use the `Estimated rows` field to specify a positive number giving the estimated number of rows that the query planner should expect the trigger function to return. This is only allowed when the function is declared to return a set. The default assumption is 1000 rows.

-   Move the `Leak proof?` switch to indicate whether the trigger function has side effects. The default is `No`. This option can only be set by the superuser.

Click the `Parameters` tab to continue.

![Create Trigger Function dialog - Parameters tab](../../images/trigger_function_parameters.png)

Use the fields in the `Parameters` tab to specify settings that will be applied when the trigger function is invoked. Click the `Add` icon (+) to add a `Name`/*Value* pair to the table below.

-   Use the drop-down listbox in the `Name` field to select a parameter.
-   Use the `Value` field to specify the value that will be associated with the selected parameter. This field is context-sensitive.

Click the `Add` icon (+) to set additional parameters; to discard a parameter, click the trash icon to the left of the row and confirm deletion in the `Delete Row` popup.

Click the `Security` tab to continue.

![Create Trigger Function dialog - Security tab](../../images/trigger_function_security.png)

Use the `Security` tab to assign privileges and define security labels.

Use the `Privileges` panel to assign usage privileges for the trigger function to a role. Click the `Add` icon (+) to to add a role to the table.

-   Select the name of the role from the drop-down listbox in the `Grantee` field.
-   Click inside the `Privileges` field. Check the boxes to the left of one or more privileges to grant the selected privilege to the specified user.
-   The current user, who is the default grantor for granting the privilege, is displayed in the `Grantor` field.

Click the `Add` icon (+) to assign additional privileges; to discard a privilege, click the trash icon to the left of the row and confirm deletion in the `Delete Row` popup.

Use the `Security Labels` panel to define security labels applied to the trigger function. Click the `Add` icon (+) to add each security label selection:

-   Specify a security label provider in the `Provider` field. The named provider must be loaded and must consent to the proposed labeling operation.
-   Specify a a security label in the `Security Label` field. The meaning of a given label is at the discretion of the label provider. PostgreSQL places no restrictions on whether or how a label provider must interpret security labels; it merely provides a mechanism for storing them.

Click the `Add` icon (+) to assign additional security labels; to discard a security label, click the trash icon to the left of the row and confirm deletion in the `Delete Row` popup.

Click the `SQL` tab to continue.

Your entries in the `Trigger function` dialog generate a SQL command (see an example below). Use the `SQL` tab for review; revisit other tabs to modify the SQL command.

**Example**

The following is an example of the sql command generated by user selections in the `Trigger function` dialog:

![Create Trigger Function dialog - SQL tab](../../images/trigger_function_sql.png)

The example shown demonstrates creating a trigger function named `emp_stamp` that checks for a new employee's name, and checks that the employee's salary is a positive value.

-   Click the `Info` button (i) to access online help. View context-sensitive help in the `Tabbed browser`, where a new tab displays the PostgreSQL core documentation.
-   Click the `Save` button to save work.
-   Click the `Cancel` button to exit without saving work.
-   Click the `Reset` button to restore configuration parameters.
