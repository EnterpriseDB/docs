Use the `Package` dialog to create a (user-defined) package specification.

The `Package` dialog organizes the management of a package through the following dialog tabs: `General`, `Header`, `Body`, and `Security`. The `SQL` tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

Use the fields in the `General` tab to identify the package:

-   Use the `Name` field to add a descriptive name for the package. The name of a new package must not match any existing package in the same schema.
-   Select the schema in which the package will reside from the drop-down listbox in the `Schema` field.
-   Store notes about the package in the `Comment` field.

Click the `Header` tab to continue.

Use the fields in the `Security` tab to to assign EXECUTE privileges for the package to a role. Click the `Add` icon (+) to set privileges for the package:

-   Select the name of the role from the drop-down listbox in the `Grantee` field.
-   Click inside the `Privileges` field. Check the boxes to the left of a privilege to grant the selected privilege to the specified user.
-   The current user, who is the default grantor for granting the privilege, is displayed in the `Grantor` field.

Click the `Add` icon (+) to assign additional privileges; to discard a privilege, click the trash icon to the left of the row, and confirm the deletion in the `Delete Row` popup.

Click the `SQL` tab to continue.

Your entries in the `Package` dialog generate a SQL command that creates or modifies a package definition:

-   Click the `Cancel` button to exit without saving work.
-   Click the `Reset` button to delete any changes to the dialog.
