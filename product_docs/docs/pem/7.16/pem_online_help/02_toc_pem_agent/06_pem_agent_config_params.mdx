title: "PEM Agent Configuration Parameters"
---

<div id="pem_agent_config_params" class="registered_link"></div>

A number of user-configurable parameters and registry entries control the behavior of the PEM Agent. With the exception of the PEM_MAXCONN (or pem_maxconn) parameter, we strongly recommend against modifying any of the configuration parameters or registry entries listed below without first consulting EnterpriseDB support experts.

> -   On 32 bit Windows systems, PEM registry entries are located in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\EnterpriseDB\\PEM\\agent
> -   On 64 bit Windows systems, PEM registry entries are located in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Wow6432Node\\EnterpriseDB\\PEM\\agent
> -   On Linux systems, PEM configuration options are stored in the agent.cfg file, located (by default) in /usr/edb/pem/agent/etc
