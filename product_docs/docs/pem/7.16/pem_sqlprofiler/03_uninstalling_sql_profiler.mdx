The process of uninstalling SQL Profiler is platform-specific.

## Uninstalling SQL Profiler from Windows Hosts

If you are using SQL Profiler on a Windows host, Windows will lock any files that have been executed or loaded into memory. To release any locked files, you must stop the Postgres server before performing an uninstall.

On Windows, you can use the `Services` dialog to control the service. To open the `Services` dialog, navigate through the `Control Panel` to the `System and Security menu`. Select `Administrative Tools`, and then double-click the `Services` icon. When the `Services` dialog opens, highlight the service name in the list, and use the option provided on the dialog to `Stop` the service.

After stopping the Postgres Server:

Delete the existing SQL Profiler query set on each node by invoking the `uninstall-sql-profiler.sql` script.

By default, the script resides in the `share\contrib` directory under your Advanced Server or PostgreSQL installation.

## Uninstalling SQL Profiler from CentOS or RHEL Hosts

To uninstall a SQL Profiler installation that resides on a Linux host:

Delete the existing SQL Profiler query set on each node by invoking the `uninstall-sql-profiler.sql` script.

By default, if you are using Advanced Server on a Linux host, the script resides in the `share/contrib` directory under the Advanced Server installation.

If you are using a PostgreSQL installation on a Linux host, the script resides in the `share/contrib` directory under the PostgreSQL installation.
