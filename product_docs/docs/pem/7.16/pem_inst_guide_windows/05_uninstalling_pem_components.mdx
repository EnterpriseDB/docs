If you uninstall the PEM server from a host, the PEM agent installed on the same host is uninstalled. But if you uninstall the PEM agent, then the PEM server installed on the same host will not be uninstalled.

You can use the Windows `Add/Remove Programs` application to remove PEM components from a Windows host. Select the `Add/Remove Programs` option from the Windows `Control Panel`. When the `control panel` opens, locate the name of the PEM component in the program list. Click the `Remove` button to remove the component.

You can also invoke the uninstaller that resides at the following location:

> For the PEM Server, `C:\Program Files\edb\pem\server\uninstall-pemserver`
>
> For the PEM Agent, `C:\Program Files\edb\pem\agent\uninstall-pemagent`
