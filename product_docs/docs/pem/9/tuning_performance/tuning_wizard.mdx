The Tuning Wizard reviews your PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation, recommending a set of configuration options tuned to the installation's anticipated workload. Benchmarking systems or systems with a high work load might require also require manual tuning to reach optimum performance.

Before using the Tuning Wizard, you must specify the name of the service in the server's Properties dialog box. In the **Advanced** tab, enter the service name in the **Server ID** field.

The Tuning Wizard can make recommendations only for those servers that reside on the same server as their bound PEM agent. If you specify a value of **Yes** in the **Remote monitoring** field when defining your server, the server doesn't display in the Tuning Wizard tree.

1. To open the Tuning Wizard, in the PEM client select **Management > Tuning Wizard**.

2. Select **Next**.

3. When you expand the **Servers** node of the tree, a list of servers appears. All of these servers are currently monitored by PEM and available for tuning. Select a server to tune it. 

   !!! Note
       If you don't provide the server's service name, then the Tuning Wizard displays a warning next to the server name on the tree.
          

4. Select **Next**.

5. Select an option in the **Machine utilization** field to specify the type of work performed by each server. The type of work performed by the server determines how the Tuning Wizard allocates system resources:

      -   Select **Dedicated** to dedicate the majority of the system resources to the database server.
      -   Select **Mixed use** to dedicate a moderate amount of system resources to the database server.
      -   Select **Developer workstation** to dedicate a relatively small amount of system resources to the database server.
      -   Select an option in the **Workload Selection** field to specify the type of workload typically performed on the selected server:
            -   Select **OLTP** if the selected server is used primarily to process online transaction workloads.
            -   Select **Mixed** if the selected server provides a mix of transaction processing and data reporting.
            -   Select **Data warehouse** if the server is used for heavy data reporting.

6. Select **Next**.

7. The tree on the Tuning Changes Summary dialog box displays the parameter setting modifications recommended for each server analyzed by the Tuning Wizard. Select the recommendations that you want the Tuning Wizard to apply or to include in a preview report:

      -   Select a parameter name, and the Tuning Wizard includes the parameter setting.
      -   Select the server name, and the Tuning Wizard includes all parameter setting recommendations for the specified server.

8. Select **Next**.

9. In the Schedule or Run? dialog box, either select a time for PEM to apply the recommended changes or generate a report that details the recommended changes.

      PEM makes the recommended changes that you selected in the Tuning Changes Summary dialog box. If you choose to generate a report, then PEM creates a report. It contains a list of the current values and recommended changes to the configuration parameters as selected in the Tuning Changes Summary dialog box. To implement changes, you must open the Tuning Wizard a second time, selecting the parameters you want to modify in the Tuning Changes Summary dialog box.

      Select **Schedule changes** to view and specify your scheduling options.

   You can set the **Configuration now?** slider to:

      - **Yes** &mdash; Apply the Tuning Wizard's recommendations and restart the server.

      - **No** &mdash; Enable the **Time?** field where you can specify a date and time with the calendar selector. PEM applies the recommended changes and restarts the server at this time.

      Select **Generate report** to view your report options.

      You can set the **View report now?** slider to:

      - **Yes** &mdash; Display the Tuning Wizard report onscreen.

      - **No** &mdash; Enable the **Save the report to file** field where you can specify a file name and location.

10. Select **Finish**.

      To confirm that the Tuning Wizard implemented the recommended changes, review the `postgresql.conf` file for the modified server. When the change is applied, the Tuning Wizard adds a comment above each modified parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file.

      You can also confirm a parameter value by querying the server. For example, to confirm the value of the shared_buffers parameter, open a SQL command line using either the Query tool (accessed through the Tools menu) or the psql client, and issue the command:

      ```sql
      SHOW shared_buffers;
      ```

The value returned by the server confirms whether the parameter was modified.
