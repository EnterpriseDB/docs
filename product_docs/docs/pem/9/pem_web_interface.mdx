After installing a PEM server and agent, you can configure PEM to start monitoring and managing PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server instances. The PEM server installer installs the PEM web interface. You can use the interface to review information about objects that reside on monitored servers or to review statistical information gathered by the PEM server.

After the server installation completes, you can open the PEM interface in your choice of browser by navigating to:

`https://<ip_address_of_PEM_host>:8443/pem`

`ip_address_of_PEM_host` specifies the IP address of the host of the PEM server. 

Use the fields on the Postgres Enterprise Manager Login window to authenticate yourself with the PEM server:

-   Provide the name of a pem database user in the **Username** field. For the first user connecting, this is the name provided when installing the PEM server.

-   Provide the password associated with the user in the **Password** field.

After providing your credentials, select **Login** to connect to PEM.

The PEM web interface opens, displaying the Global Overview dashboard.

![The Global Overview Dashboard](images/global_overview.png)

The Browser pane displays a tree that provides access to information about the database objects that reside on each server. The tree expands to display a hierarchical view of the servers and objects that the PEM server monitors.

Before you can use the PEM web interface to manage or monitor a database server, you must register that server with the PEM server. When you register a server, you describe the connection to the server, provide authentication information for the connection, and specify any management preferences (optionally binding an agent).

A server can be managed or unmanaged:

-   A *managed* server is bound to a PEM agent. The PEM agent monitors the server to which it's bound and performs tasks or reports statistics for display on the PEM dashboards. A managed server has access to extended PEM functionality such as custom alerting. When registering a server, you can also allow PEM to restart a managed server as required.
-   An *unmanaged* server isn't bound to a PEM agent. You can create database objects on an unmanaged server, but extended PEM functionality (such as custom alerting) isn't supported on an unmanaged server.

You must also ensure the `pg_hba.conf` file of the server that you're registering allows connections from the host of the PEM web interface.

## Accessing in-app help for UI details

The in-app help provides comprehensive details about the PEM web interface, including the menu items, charts and graphs on the dashboards, and the options on the dialog boxes. The in-app help also includes instructions for creating database objects.

- To access the landing page for the help, select **Help > Online help**. 
- To access context-sensitive help for a dialog box, select **?**.

## PEM client object browser

The Browser tree control provides access to information and management options for the database objects that reside on each server. The tree control expands to display a hierarchical view of the servers and objects that are monitored by the PEM server. You can use context menu options, accessed by right-clicking nodes of the tree control, to create new objects and modify and delete existing objects if your role holds the required privileges.

Expand nodes in the tree control to display a hierarchical view of the database objects that reside on a selected server:

-   Use the plus sign (+) to the left of a node to expand a segment of the tree control.
-   Use the minus sign (-) to the left of a node to close that node.

Context menu options can include one or more of the following selections:

| Option                    | Action                                                                                                                                                                             |

Select the name of an agent or server and navigate to the **Dashboard** tab to review session or server activity for the currently selected object.

When opened from the name of an agent or server, the **Dashboard** tab provides a graphical analysis of usage statistics:

-   The Server sessions or Database sessions graph displays the interactions with the server or database.
-   The Transactions per second graph displays the commits, rollbacks, and total transactions per second that are taking place on the server or database.
-   The Tuples In graph displays the number of tuples inserted, updated, and deleted on the server or database.
-   The Tuples Out graph displays the number of tuples fetched and returned from the server or database.
-   The Block I/O graph displays the number of blocks read from the file system or fetched from the buffer cache (but not the operating system's file system cache) for the server or database.
-   The Server activity tabbed panel displays tables that contain session information, session locks, prepared transactions, and configuration.

Navigate to the **Properties** tab to review the properties of the item currently selected in the tree control.

The **SQL** tab displays the SQL code used to generate the object currently selected in the Browser tree control.

The **Statistics** tab displays the statistics gathered for each object on the tree control. The statistics displayed in the table vary by the type of object that's highlighted. Select a column heading to sort the table by the data displayed in the column. Select it again to reverse the sort order. The following table lists some of the statistics that might be displayed.

| Panel                     | Description                                                                                                |

The **Dependencies** tab displays the objects on which the currently selected object depends. To ensure the integrity of the database structure, the server makes sure that you don't accidentally drop objects that other objects depend on. You must use `DROP CASCADE` to remove an object on which another object depends.

The **Dependencies** table displays:

-   The **Type** field, which specifies the parent object type.
-   The **Name** field, which specifies the identifying name of the parent object.
-   The **Restriction** field, which describes the dependency relationship between the currently selected object and the parent.

The **Dependents** tab displays a table of objects that depend on the object currently selected in the Browser tree. A dependent object can be dropped without affecting the object currently selected in the Browser tree control.

-   The **Type** field specifies the dependent object type.
-   The **Name** field specifies the identifying name for the dependent object.
-   The **Restriction** field describes the dependency relationship between the currently selected object and the parent.

Navigate to the **Monitoring** tab to access information presented on [PEM dashboards](/pem/latest/monitoring_performance/dashboards/). Dashboards display statistical information about the objects monitored by the PEM server.

PEM opens additional tabs when you access PEM functionality through the Management or Tools dialog boxes. Right-click the current tab and select from a context menu that allows you to customize the display for your working style:

-   Select **Remove Panel** to remove the currently selected panel.
-   Select **Rename Panel** to rename the currently selected panel.
-   Select **Detach Panel** to detach the currently selected panel, repositioning it for convenience.
-   Select **Add Panel** and select any of the available options to add to the panels.

The PEM client preserves any adjustments when you exit the program. To reset the PEM client to its original format, select **File > Reset Layout**.

Use the **Information** ![info](../images/lginformation.png) icon to access information about the chart or graph.

### Personalizing a graphic

When you select the **Personalize** icon, the Personalize chart configuration dialog box opens.

Use controls on the Personalize chart configuration dialog box to modify the properties of the graphic:

-   Use the **Auto Refresh** control to increase or decrease the number of seconds between refreshes.
-   Use the **Auto Refresh** field to specify the number of seconds between updates of the data displayed in the table or chart.
-   If applicable, use the **Download as** field to indicate if you want to download a chart as a .jpeg image or a .png image.
-   If applicable, use the **Colors** selectors to specify the display colors to use on a chart.
-   If applicable, set the **Show Acknowledged Alerts** switch to **Yes** to indicate that you want the table to display alerts that you have acknowledged with a check box in the **Ack'ed** column. Set the field to **No** to indicate for the table to hide any acknowledged alerts. Acknowledged alerts aren't purged from the table content until the time specified in the alert definition passes.

After personalizing the display properties, use the controls in the upper-right hand corner to apply your changes:

-   Use the **Delete** icon to reset the properties of the graphic to their default settings. Use the menu to specify whether to apply the change to only this instance of the graphic or to the same graphic when displayed on other dashboards.
-   Use the **Save** icon to save your changes to the properties for the graphic. Use the menu to specify to apply the change to only this instance of the graphic or to the same graphic when displayed on other dashboards.

## Browser toolbar

The browser toolbar provides shortcuts for frequently used features, like View Data and the Query tool. This toolbar is visible on the Browser panel. Buttons get enabled/disabled based on the selected browser node.

-   Use the **Query tool** button to open the Query tool in the current database context.
-   Use the **View Data** button to view/edit the data stored in a selected table.
-   Use the **Filtered Rows** button to access the Data Filter popup to apply a filter to a set of data for viewing/editing.

## PEM menu bar

The PEM menu bar provides access to commands and features that you can use to manage your database servers and the objects that reside on those servers. If an option is disabled:

-   The database server to which you're currently connected might not support the selected feature.

-   The selected menu option might not apply to the current object.

-   The role that you used to connect to the server might not have enough privileges to change the selected object.

Context-sensitive menus across the top of the PEM web interface allow you to customize your environment and provide access to the enterprise management features of PEM.
