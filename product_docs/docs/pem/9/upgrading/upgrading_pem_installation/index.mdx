The process of upgrading a PEM installation is platform specific. You can update a PEM agent or server on a Linux platform by using the native packages and on a Windows platform by using the PEM graphical installer available for Windows. 

!!! Note
    - Prior to PEM 7.8 release, you installed PEM agent or server on Linux either by using the     
      graphical installer or by using the RPMs. 
    - For PEM version 7.8 and later, PEM graphical installers for Linux are discontinued. To upgrade a 
      PEM agent or server on a Linux host from any earlier version to PEM version 7.9 or later, you must use native packages.

Links to PEM installers and RPMs are available at the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/edb-postgres-enterprise-manager).
