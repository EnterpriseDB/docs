If you're updating PEM components and the PEM backend database, perform PEM component updates on the server and agent before updating the backend database. For more information about updating PEM component software, see [Upgrading a PEM installation](upgrading_pem_installation/).

!!! Note
    -   From PEM 8.0 onwards, PostgreSQL or EPAS versions 11 or later are only supported as backend database servers. As a result, if 
        your backend database server is earlier than version 11, you need to first upgrade your backend database server and then upgrade the PEM components.

    -   After upgrading the backend database server, if you encounter this error while creating the server in the PEM web interface:
    
        ```text
        Error - User does not have enough permission to add new server.
                Please contact the administrator to grant 'pem_database_server_registration' role 
                to the 'enterprisedb' user.
        ```

        Resolve the error by updating the roles and granting appropriate permissions:

       ```sql
       UPDATE pem.roles SET rolid = pr.oid FROM pg_roles pr WHERE pr.rolname = 'pem_' || component;
       ```

The update process uses the pg_upgrade utility to migrate from one version of the backend server to a more recent version. pg_upgrade enables migration between any supported version of Postgres and any subsequent release of Postgres that's supported on the same platform.

If the source PEM server is earlier than the 7.16 version, then you need to replace the following functions before you run pg_upgrade:

-  The `abstime`, `reltime`, and `tinterval` datatypes are deprecated from Postgres version 12 or later, hence to replace those dataypes  with `timestamptz` data type use this command:

    ```sql
    DO
    $$
    DECLARE
        rec record;
        cnt integer;
    BEGIN
        -- Check for the deprecated type in our user info probe
        SELECT count(*) INTO cnt
        FROM pem.probe_column
        WHERE sql_data_type = ‘abstime’ AND internal_name = ‘valuntil’;
            IF cnt = 0 THEN
                RETURN;
            END IF;
        ALTER TABLE pemdata.user_info
            ALTER COLUMN valuntil SET DATA TYPE timestamptz;
        ALTER TABLE pemhistory.user_info
                ALTER COLUMN valuntil SET DATA TYPE timestamptz;
        -- Now update the pem.probe_column itself
        UPDATE pem.probe_column
        SET sql_data_type = ‘timestamptz’
        WHERE sql_data_type = ‘abstime’ AND internal_name = ‘valuntil’;
    END;
    $$ LANGUAGE ‘plpgsql’;
    ```

-   Replace this function to avoid any alert errors:

    ```sql
    CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pem.check_alert_params_array_size(
    template_id pem.alert_template.id%type, params text[]
    )
    RETURNS bool AS $FUNC$
    DECLARE
        res bool := TRUE;
    BEGIN
        /*
        * During restoring the pem database, it does not maintain the order while
        * inserting data in the table, and uses the sort table based on the
        * names.
        * Hence - we need to check the foreign key constraint is present before
        * validating these values.
        */
        IF EXISTS(
            SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.table_constraints
            WHERE constraint_name='alert_template_id_fkey' AND
            table_name='alert' AND table_schema='pem'
        ) THEN
      /*
       * Need to use the IS TRUE construct outside the main query, because
       * otherwise if there's no template by that ID then the query would return
       * 0 rows and the result of the function would be undefined and CHECK
       * constraint would succeed.
       * Probably this is being over-cautious, because pem.alert.template_id
       * references pem.alert_template.id. But the SQL standard (probably) does
       * not define the order in which the CHECK or the FOREIGN KEY constraints
       * should be validated; in case CHECK is validated first, we want it to
       * fail.
       */
    EXECUTE $SQL$
        SELECT (
            SELECT pem.check_array_size_equal(t.param_names, $2)
            FROM pem.alert_template AS t
            WHERE id = $1
        ) IS TRUE
      $SQL$ INTO res USING template_id, params;
    END IF;
     RETURN res;
    END
    $FUNC$ LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';
    ```

pg_upgrade supports a transfer of data between servers of the same type. For example, you can use pg_upgrade to move data from a PostgreSQL 10 backend database to a PostgreSQL 11 backend database but not to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11 backend database. If you want to migrate to a different type of backend database (such as from a PostgreSQL server to EDB Postgres Advanced Server), see [Moving the Postgres Enterprise Manager server](moving_pem_server).

You can find more information about using pg_upgrade at [pg_upgrade](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/pgupgrade.html).

1.  Download and invoke the updated installer. Installers for PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server are available through the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres).

    After downloading the installer for the server version you are upgrading to, invoke the installer on the host of the PEM server. Follow the onscreen instructions of the installation wizard to configure and install the Postgres server.

    You can optionally use a custom-built PostgreSQL server as a host of the PEM backend database. If you're upgrading from a PostgreSQL backend database listening on port 5432, the new server must be configured to listen on a different port.

2.  Configure SSL utilities on the new server. The new backend database must be running the same version of sslutils that the current backend database is running. You can download the SSL Utils package from the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/modified-gpl-source-code).

     You don't need to manually add the sslutils extension when using the EDB Postgres Advanced Server as the new backend database. The process of configuring sslutils is platform specific.

    **On Linux**

    -   On an EDB Postgres Advanced Server backend database, the sslutils extension is installed by default.

    -   If you're using PostgreSQL as a PEM backend database, verify that you have access to the PostgreSQL community repository, and use the command:

        ```shell
        yum install sslutils_<X>
        ```

        Where `<X>` is the server version.

    -   If you're using a EDB one-click installer of PostgreSQL as a PEM backend database, use the command:

        ```shell
         yum install gcc openssl-devel
        ```

        Set the value of PATH so it can locate the pg_config program

        ```ini
         export PATH=$PATH:/opt/postgres_inst_dir/<X>/bin/
        ```

        Move into the `sslutils` folder, and enter:

        ```ini
         make USE_PGXS=1
         make USE_PGXS=1 install
        ```

        Use psql to create the sslutils extension

        ```sql
         CREATE EXTENSION sslutils
        ```

        Debian 10 and Ubuntu 20 have increased the requirements to accept the certificates for security reasons. If you want to install the PEM agent on any of the machines, you must upgrade ssltuils to 1.3 where 4096-bit RSA key and sha256 signature algorithm support was added. If you don't upgrade sslutils to 1.3, then PEM agent might fail to connect to the PEM backend database server, and it might log the error "ca md too weak."

    **On Windows**

    -   You must compile sslutils on the new backend database with the same compiler that was used to compile sslutils on the original backend database. If you're moving to a Postgres database that was installed using a PostgreSQL one-click installer (from EDB) or an EDB Postgres Advanced Server installer, use Visual Studio to build sslutils. If you're upgrading to PostgreSQL 10 or later, use Visual Studio 2010.

        For detailed information about building a specific version of Postgres on Windows, consult the core documentation for that version. Core documentation is available at the [PostgreSQL project website](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/install-windows.html).

    -   While specific details of the process vary by platform and compiler, the basic steps on each platform are the same. The example that follows shows compiling OpenSSL support for PostgreSQL on a 32-bit Windows system.

        Before compiling the OpenSSL extension, you must locate and install OpenSSL for your version of Windows. Before invoking the OpenSSL installer you might need to download and install a prerequisite redistributable (such as `vcredist_x86.exe`).

        After installing OpenSSL, download and unpack the [sslutils utility package](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/modified-gpl-source-code).

    -   Copy the unpacked `sslutils` folder to the Postgres installation directory (`C:\ProgramFiles\PostgreSQL\<x.x>`).

    -   Open the Visual Studio command line, and navigate into the `sslutils` directory. Use the following commands to build sslutils:

        ```ini
        SET USE_PGXS=1

        SET GETTEXTPATH=\ <path_to_gettext>

        SET OPENSSLPATH=\ <path_to_openssl>

        SET PGPATH=\ <path_to_pg_installation_dir>

        SET ARCH=x86

        msbuild sslutils.proj /p:Configuration=Release
        ```

    Where:

    -   `path_to_gettext` specifies the location of the `GETTEXT` library and header files.

    -   `path_to_openssl` specifies the location of the openssl library and header files.

    -   `path_to_pg_installation_dir` specifies the location of the Postgres installation.

    For example, the following set of commands builds OpenSSL support into the PostgreSQL 11 server:

        ```ini
        SET USE_PGXS=1

        SET OPENSSLPATH=C:\OpenSSL-Win32

        SET GETTEXTPATH="C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\11"

        SET PGPATH="C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\11"

        SET ARCH=x86

        msbuild sslutils.proj /p:Configuration=Release
        ```

    -   When the build completes, the `sslutils` directory contains the following files:

        `sslutils--1.3.sql`

        `sslutils--unpackaged--1.3.sql`

        `sslutils--pemagent.sql.in`

        `sslutils.dll`

    -   Copy the compiled sslutils files to the appropriate directory for your installation; for example:

        ```sql
        COPY sslutils*.sql "%PGPATH%\share\extension\"

        COPY sslutils.dll "%PGPATH%\lib\"

        COPY sslutils.control "%PGPATH%\share\extension\"
        ```

3.  Stop the services of both the old backend database and the new backend database.

    On RHEL 8.x, open a command line and assume the identity of a superuser. Enter the command:

    ```shell
    systemctl <service_name> stop
    ```

    Where `<service_name>` specifies the name of the Postgres service.

    On Windows, you can use the Services dialog box to control the service. To stop the service:
        1. On the Control Panel select **System and Security > Administrative Tools**.
        1. Double-click **Services**. 
        1. In the Services dialog box, select the service name and selet **Stop**.

4.  Use the pg_upgrade utility to perform an in-place transfer of existing data between the old backend database and the new backend  database. If your server is configured to enforce md5 authentication, you might need to add an entry to the `.pgpass` file that specifies the connection properties (and password) for the database superuser. Or you might need to modify the `pg_hba.conf` file to allow trust connections before invoking `pg_upgrade`. For more information about creating an entry in the `.pgpass` file, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-pgpass.html).

    During the upgrade process, pg_upgrade writes a series of log files. The cluster owner must invoke pg_upgrade from a directory in which they have write privileges. If the upgrade completes successfully, pg_upgrade removes the log files when the upgrade completes. If you don't want pg_upgrade to delete the upgrade log files, include the `--retain` keyword when invoking pg_upgrade.

    To invoke pg_upgrade, assume the identity of the cluster owner, navigate to a directory in which the cluster owner has write privileges, and execute the command:

    ```shell
    <path_to_pg_upgrade> pg_upgrade

    -d <old_data_dir_path>

    -D <new_data_dir_path>

    -b <old_bin_dir_path> -B <new_bin_dir_path>

    -p <old_port> -P <new_port>

    -u <user_name>
    ```

    Where:

    -   `path_to_pg_upgrade` specifies the location of the pg_upgrade utility. By default, pg_upgrade is installed in the `bin` directory under your Postgres directory.
    -   `old_data_dir_path` specifies the complete path to the data directory of the old backend database.
    -   `new_data_dir_path` specifies the complete path to the data directory of the new backend database.
    -   `old_bin_dir_path` specifies the complete path to the bin directory of the old backend database.
    -   `new_bin_dir_path` specifies the complete path to the bin directory of the old backend database.
    -   `old_port` specifies the port on which the old server is listening.
    -   `new_port` specifies the port on which the new server is listening.
    -   `user_name` specifies the name of the cluster owner.

    For example, the following command instructs pg_upgrade to migrate the PEM database from PostgreSQL 9.6 to PostgreSQL 11 on a Windows system (if the backend databases are installed in their default locations):

    ```shell
    C:\>"C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\11\bin\pg_upgrade.exe"

    -d "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\10\data"

    -D "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\11\data"

    -b "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\10\bin"

    -B "C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\11\bin"

    -p 5432 -P 5433

    -U postgres
    ```

    Once invoked, pg_upgrade performs consistency checks before moving the data to the new backend database. When the upgrade is finished, pg_upgrade notifies you that the upgrade is complete.

    For detailed information about using pg_upgrade options or troubleshooting the upgrade process, see [pg_upgrade](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/pgupgrade.html).

5.  Copy the following certificate files from the `data` directory of the old backend database to the `data` directory of the new backend database:

    `ca_certificate.crt`

    `ca_key.key`

    `root.crt`

    `root.crl`

    `server.key`

    `server.crt`

    Once in place on the target server, make sure the files have these platform-specific permissions:

    **Permissions and ownership on Linux**

    | File name          | Owner     | Permissions     |
    | ------------------ | --------- | --------------- |
    | ca_certificate.crt | postgres  | -rw-------      |
    | ca_key.key         | postgres  | -rw-------      |
    | root.crt           | postgres  | -rw-------      |
    | root.crl           | postgres  | -rw-------      |
    | server.key         | postgres  | -rw-------      |
    | server.crt         | postgres  | -rw-r--r--      |

    On Linux, the certificate files must be owned by postgres. You can use the following command at the command line to modify the ownership of the files:

    ```shell
    chown postgres <file_name>
    ```

    Where `file_name` specifies the name of the certificate file.

    Only the owner of the `server.crt` file can modify it, but any user can read it. You can use the following command to set the file permissions for the `server.crt` file:

    ```shell
    chmod 644 server.crt
    ```

    Only the owner of the other certificate files can modify or read the file. You can use the following command to set the file permissions:

    ```shell
    chmod 600 <file_name>
    ```

    Where `file_name` specifies the name of the file.

    **Permissions and ownership on Windows**

    On Windows, the service account that performed the PEM server and backend database installation on the target host must own the certificate files moved from the source host. If you invoked the PEM server and Postgres installer using **Run as Administrator** from the context menu of the installer, the owner of the certificate files is Administrators.

    To review and modify file permissions on Windows, right-click the file name and select **Properties**.

    On the **Security** tab select a group or user name to view the assigned permissions. Select **Edit** or **Advanced** to open dialog boxes that allow you to modify the permissions associated with the selected user.


6.  The `postgresql.conf` file contains parameter settings that specify server behavior. Modify the `postgresql.conf` file on the new server to match the configuration specified in the `postgresql.conf` file of the old server.

    By default, the `postgresql.conf` file is located:

    -   For Postgres version earlier than 10 on Linux, in `/opt/PostgreSQL/<X>/data`
    -   For Postgres version 10 or later when installed with graphical installers on Linux, in `/opt/PostgreSQL/<X>/data`
    -   For Postgres version 10 or later when installed with an RPM on Linux, in `/usr/pgsql/<X>/data`
    -   For any Postgres version on Windows, in `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<X>\data`

    Where `<X>` is the version of Postgres on your system.

    Use your choice of editor to update the `postgresql.conf` file of the new server. Modify the following parameters:

    -   The `port` parameter to listen on the port monitored by your original backend database (typically set to `5432`).
    -   The `ssl` parameter to be set to `on`

    You must also ensure that the following parameters are enabled. If the parameters are commented out, remove the pound sign from in front of each `postgresql.conf` file entry:

    -   `ssl_cert_file = 'server.crt' # (change requires restart)`
    -   `ssl_key_file = 'server.key' # (change requires restart)`
    -   `ssl_ca_file = 'root.crt' # (change requires restart)`
    -   `ssl_crl_file = 'root.crl'`

    Your installation might have other parameter settings that require modification to ensure that the new backend database behaves like the old backend database. Review the `postgresql.conf` files carefully to ensure that the configuration of the new server matches the configuration of the old server.

7.  The `pg_hba.conf` file contains parameter settings that specify how the server enforces host-based authentication. When you install the PEM server, the installer modifies the `pg_hba.conf` file, adding entries to the top of the file:

    `# Adding entries for PEM Agens and admins to connect to PEM server`

    `hostssl pem +pem_user 192.168.2.0/24 md5`

    `hostssl pem +pem_agent 192.168.2.0/24 cert`

    `# Adding entries (localhost) for PEM Agens and admins to connect to PEM server`

    `hostssl pem +pem_user 127.0.0.1/32 md5`

    `hostssl postgres +pem_user 127.0.0.1/32 md5`

    `hostssl pem +pem_user 127.0.0.1/32 md5`

    `hostssl pem +pem_agent 127.0.0.1/32 cert`

    By default, the `pg_hba.conf` file is located at the following location:

    -   For Postgres version earlier than 10 on Linux, in `/opt/PostgreSQL/<X>/data`
    -   For Postgres version 10 or later when installed with graphical installers on Linux, in `/Opt/PostgreSQL/<X>/data`
    -   For Postgres version 10 or later when installed with RPMs on Linux, in `/var/lib/pgsql/<X>/data`
    -   For Advanced Server version 10 or later when installed with RPMs on Linux, in `/var/lib/edb/as<X>/data`
    -   For any Postgres version on Windows, in `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\<X>\data`

    Where `<X>` is the version of Postgres on your system.

    Using your editor of choice, copy the entries from the `pg_hba.conf` file of the old server to the `pg_hba.conf` file for the new server.

8.  Restart the service of the new backend database.

    On RHEL 8.x, at the command line as superuser enter:

    ```shell
    systemctl stop <service_name>
    ```

    Where `service_name` is the name of the backend database server.

    If you're using Windows, you can use the **Services** dialog box to control the service:
    
    1.  In the Control Panel, select **System and Security > Administrative Tools**.
    1.  Double-click the **Services** icon. 
    1.  In the Services dialog box, select the service name and start the service.
