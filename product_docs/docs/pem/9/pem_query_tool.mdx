PEM contains a feature-rich interactive development environment (IDE) that allows you to issue ad hoc SQL queries against Postgres servers.

You can access the Query tool by selecting **Tools > Query tool** or through the context menu of select nodes of the Browser tree. The Query tool allows you to:

-   Issue ad hoc SQL queries.
-   Execute arbitrary SQL commands.
-   Edit the result set of a SELECT query if it's [updatable](/pem/latest/pem_query_tool/).
-   Configure and display current connection and transaction status.
-   Save the data displayed in the output panel to a CSV file.
-   Review the execution plan of a SQL statement in either text, graphical, or table format (similar to <https://explain.depesz.com>).
-   View analytical information about a SQL statement.

The Query tool features two panels:

-   The upper panel displays the SQL editor. You can use the panel to enter, edit, or execute a query. It also shows the **History** tab, which you can use to view the queries that ran in the session. You can use the scratch pad to hold text snippets during editing.
    
    To reopen a closed scratch pad or open a new one, right-click the SQL editor and select **Add Panel**. You can also open new scratch pads from other panels using the same technique.
-   The lower panel displays the Data Output panel. The tabbed panel displays:
    -   The result set returned by a query
    -   Information about a query's execution plan
    -   server messages related to the query's execution
    -   Any asynchronous notifications received from the server.

## The Query tool toolbar

The toolbar uses context-sensitive icons that provide shortcuts to frequently performed tasks.

## The SQL editor panel

The SQL editor panel is a workspace where you can manually provide a query, copy a query from another source, or read a query from a file. The SQL editor features syntax coloring and auto-completion.

To use auto-complete, begin typing your query. When you want the editor to suggest object names or commands that might be next in your query, press **Control+Space**. For example, type `\*SELECT \* FROM\*` (with a trailing space), and then press **Control+Space** to select from a menu of auto-complete options.

After entering a query, select **Execute/Refresh** from the toolbar. The database server receives the complete contents of the SQL editor panel to execute. To execute only a section of the code that's displayed in the SQL editor, select the text that you want the server to execute, and select **Execute/Refresh**.

The message returned by the server when a command executes is displayed on the **Messages** tab. If the command is successful, the **Messages** tab displays execution details.

The **Edit** menu helps with code formatting and commenting:

-   Use auto-indent to indent text to the same depth as the previous line by pressing **Return**.
-   Block indent text by selecting two or more lines and pressing **Tab**.
-   Implement or remove SQL-style or toggle C-style comment notation within your code.

You can also drag certain objects from the tree to save time spent typing long object names. Text containing the object name is fully qualified with the schema name. Double quotes are added if required. For functions and procedures, the function name along with parameter names are pasted into the Query tool.

## The Data Output panel

The Data Output panel displays data and statistics generated by the most recently executed query.

### Data Output tab

The **Data Output** tab displays the result set of the query in a table format. You can:

-   Select and copy from the result set.
-   Use the **Execute/Refresh** options to retrieve query execution information and set query execution options.
-   Select **Download as CSV** to download the content of the **Data Output** tab as a comma-delimited file.
-   Edit the data in the result set of a `SELECT` query if it's updatable.

A result set is updatable if:

-   All columns are either selected directly from a single table or they aren't actually a table column (for example, the concatenation of two columns). You can edit only columns that are selected directly from the table. Other columns are read-only.
-   All the primary key columns or OIDs of the table are selected in the result set.

Any columns that are renamed or selected more than once are also read-only.

!!! Note
    To work with an updatable query result set, you must have psycopg2 driver version 2.8 or later installed.

Editable and read-only columns are identified using pencil and lock icons in the column headers.

An updatable result set is similar to the data grid in View/Edit Data mode, and you can modify it in the same way.

If auto-commit is off, data changes are made as part of the ongoing transaction. If no transaction is ongoing, a new one is started. The data changes aren't committed to the database unless the transaction is committed.

If any errors occur while saving (for example, trying to save a NULL into a column with a NOT NULL constraint), the data changes are rolled back to a savepoint to ensure any previously executed queries in the ongoing transaction aren't rolled back.

All rowsets from previous queries or commands that are displayed in the Data Output panel get discarded when you invoke another query. Open another Query tool browser tab to keep your previous results available.

### Explain tab

To generate the Explain or Explain Analyze plan of a query, select **Explain** or **Explain Analyze** in the toolbar.

You can select more options related to **Explain** and **Explain Analyze** from the menu.

!!! Note
    PEM generates the Explain Analyze plan in JSON format.

On successful generation of an Explain plan, three tabs/panels appear under the **Explain** panel.

### Graphical tab

To download the plan as an SVG file, select **Download** in the top-left corner of the Explain canvas. **Download as SVG** isn't supported on Internet Explorer.

The query plan that accompanies **Explain Analyze** is available on the **Data Output** tab.

### Analysis tab

The **Analysis** tab shows the plan details in table format, generating a format similar to the one available at `explain.depsez.com`. Each row of the table represents the data for an Explain Plan node. The output can contain the node information, exclusive timing, inclusive timing, actual versus planned rows, actual rows, planned rows, or loops. Child rows of the selected row are marked with an orange dot.

If the percentage of the exclusive/inclusive timings of the total query time is:

-  Greater than 90, red appears

-  Greater than 50, orange appears

-  Greater than 10, yellow appears

If the planner has misestimated the number of rows (actual verse planned) by:

-  10 times, yellow appears

-  100 times, orange appears

-  1000 times, red appears

### Statistics tab

The **Statistics** tab displays information in two tables:

-  Statistics per Node Type tells you how many times each node type was referenced.
-  Statistics per Table tells you how many times each table was referenced by the query.

### Messages tab

Use the **Messages** tab to view information about the most recently executed query. If the server returns an error, the error message appears on the **Messages** tab, and the syntax that caused the error is underlined in the SQL editor. If a query succeeds, the **Messages** tab shows how long the query took to complete and how many rows were retrieved.

### Notifications tab

Use the **Notifications** tab to view the notifications using the PostgreSQL Listen/Notify feature. For more details, see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-listen.html).

For example:

1.  Execute `LISTEN "foo"` in first Query tool session.

![Query tool - notifications listen](images/query_output_notifications_listen.png)

2.  In the another Query tool session, execute the `Notify` command or `pg_notify`
    function to send the notification of the event together with the payload.

![Query tool - notifications notify](images/query_output_notifications_notify.png)

3.  You can observe the **Notification** tab in the first Query tool session
    where it shows the recorded time, event, process ID, and the payload of the channel.

![Query tool - Output Notifications panel](images/query_output_notifications_panel.png)

## Query History panel

Use the **Query History** tab to review activity for the current session. The **Query History** tab displays information about recent commands including:

-   The date and time that a query was invoked.
-   The text of the query.
-   The number of rows returned by the query.
-   The amount of time it took the server to process the query and return a result set.
-   Messages returned by the server (not noted on the **Messages** tab).
-   The source of the query (indicated by icons corresponding to the toolbar).

You can show or hide the queries generated internally by pgAdmin (during View/Edit Data or Save Data operations).

To erase the content of the **Query History** tab, select **Clear > Clear history**.

Query history is maintained across sessions for each database on a per-user basis when running in Query tool mode. In View/Edit Data mode, history isn't retained. By default, the last 20 queries are stored for each database. You can adjust this in `config_local.py` by overriding the `MAX_QUERY_HIST_STORED` value.

## Connection status

Use **Connection Status** to view the current connection and transaction status by selecting the status in the Query tool.

![Query tool - Connection Status button](images/query_tool_connection_status.png)

## Macros

Query tool macros enable you to execute predefined SQL queries by pressing a single key. Predefined queries can contain the placeholder `$SELECTION$`. When the macro executes, the placeholder is replaced with the currently selected text in the Query Editor pane of the Query tool.

To create a macro:

1.  In the Query tool, select **Macros > Manage Macros**. 
2.  Select the key you want to use. Enter the name of the macro and the query.
3.  Optionally, include the selection placeholder.
4.  Select **Save**. 

To clear a macro, in the Manage Macros dialog box, select the macro and select **Clear**. Respond **Yes** to the prompt.

To clear all macros, select **Clear** next to **Key**. Respond **Yes** to the prompt.

To execute a macro, select the shortcut keys, or select it from the **Macros** menu.
