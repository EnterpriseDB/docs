## Managing job notifications

In the PEM console, you can configure the settings for sending the SMTP trap on success or failure of a system-generated job listed under scheduled tasks or a custom agent job. You can configure these email notification settings at the following three levels to send email notifications to the specified user group. These levels are shown in order of precedence.

-   Job level
-   Agent level
-   PEM server level (default)

### Configuring job notifications at job level

You can configure email notification settings at job level only for a custom agent job in one of the following ways:

-   For a new agent job, you can configure the email notification settings in the **Notification** tab of the Create Agent Job wizard while creating the job.
-   For an existing custom job, you can edit the properties of the job and configure the notification settings.

Use the **Notifications** tab to configure the email notification settings on job level:

-   Use the **Send the notifications** field to specify when you want to send the email notifications.
-   Use the **Email group** field to specify the email group to send the email notification to.

### Configuring job notifications at agent level

Select the agent in the tree view, right-click, and select **Properties**. In the Properties dialog box, select the **Job Notifications** tab.

Use the Job notifications tab to configure the email notification settings at agent level:

-   Use the **Override default configuration?** switch to specify if you want the agent level job notification settings to override the default job notification settings. Select **Yes** to enable the rest of the settings on this dialog box to define when and to whom to send the job notifications. 
-   Use the **Email on job completion?** switch to specify whether to send the job notification when the job completes successfully.
-   Use the **Email on a job failure?** switch to specify whether to send the job notification when the job fails.
-   Use the **Email group** field to specify the email group to send the job notification to.

### Configuring job notifications at server level

You can use the Server Configuration dialog box to provide information about your email notification configuration at PEM server level. To open the Server Configuration dialog box, select **Management > Server Configuration**.

Four server configuration parameters specify information about your job notification preferences at PEM server level:

-   Use the **job_failure_notification** switch to specify if you want to send an email notification after each job failure.
-   Use the **job_notification_email_group** parameter to specify the email group to send the email notification to.
-   Use the **job_retention_time parameter** to specify the number of days to retain nonrecurring scheduled tasks in the system.
-   Use the **job_status_change_notification** switch to specify if you want to send an email notification after each job status change, that is, failure, success, or interrupted.

## Managing PEM scheduled jobs

You can create a PEM scheduled job to perform a set of steps you define in the specified sequence. These steps can contain SQL code or a batch/shell script that you can run on a server that's bound with the agent. You can schedule these jobs to suit your business requirements. For example, you can create a job for taking a backup of a particular database server and schedule it to run on a specific date and time of every month.

To create or manage a PEM scheduled job, use the PEM tree to browse to the PEM agent for which you want to create the job. The tree displays a **Jobs** node, under which currently defined jobs are listed. To add a job, right-click the **Jobs** node and select **Create Job** from the context menu.

Use the tabs on the Create - Agent Job dialog box to define the steps and schedule that make up a PEM scheduled job.

Use the **General** tab to provide general information about a job:

-   Provide a name for the job in the **Name** field.
-   Set the **Enabled** switch to **Yes** to enable a job. Set it to **No** to disable a job.
-   Use the **Comment** field to store notes about the job.

Use the **Steps** tab to define and manage the steps that the job performs. Select **Add** (+) to add a step. Then, select the compose icon, located at the left side of the header, to open the Step Definition dialog box.

Use the Step Definition dialog box to define the step:

-   Provide a name for the step in the **Name** field. Steps are performed in alphanumeric order by name.

-   Use the **Enabled** switch to include the step when executing the job (**True**) or to disable the step (**False**).

-   Use the **Kind** switch to indicate if the job step invokes SQL code (**SQL**) or a batch script (**Batch**).

    -   If you select **SQL**, use the **Code** tab to provide SQL code for the step.
    -   If you select **Batch**, use the **Code** tab to provide the batch script to execute during the step.

-   Use the **On error** list to specify the behavior of pgAgent if it encounters an error while executing the step. Select from:

    -   **Fail** &mdash; Stop the job if you encounter an error while processing this step.
    -   **Success** &mdash; Mark the step as completing successfully and continue.
    -   **Ignore** &mdash; Ignore the error and continue.

-   If you selected SQL as your input for the **Kind** switch:

    -   Use the **Server** field to specify the server that's bound with the agent for which you are creating the PEM scheduled job.
    -   Use the **Database** field to specify the database that's associated with the server that you selected.

-   Use the **Comment** field to provide a comment about the step.

-   Use the context-sensitive field on the Step Definition dialog box **Code** tab to provide the SQL code or batch script to execute during the step:

    -   If the step invokes SQL code, provide one or more SQL statements in the **SQL query** field.

    -   If the step invokes a batch script, provide the script in the **Code** field. If you're running on a Windows server, use standard batch file syntax. On a Linux server, you can use any shell script, provided that you specify a suitable interpreter on the first line (such as `#!/bin/sh`). Along with the defined inline code, you can also provide the path of any batch script, shell script, or SQL file on the filesystem.

        -   To invoke a script on a Linux system, you must modify the entry for the `batch_script_user` parameter in the `agent.cfg` file and specify the user who runs the script. You can specify either a nonroot user or root for this parameter. If you don't specify a user or the specified user doesn't exist, then the script doesn't execute. Restart the agent after modifying the file.

        -   To invoke a script on a Windows system, set the registry entry for `AllowBatchJobSteps` to `true` and restart the PEM agent. PEM registry entries are located in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\EnterpriseDB\PEM\agent`.

After providing all the information required by the step, select **Save**.

Select **Add** (+) to add each step, or select the **Schedules** tab to define the job schedule.

On the **Schedules** tab, select **Add** (+) to add a schedule for the job. Then select the compose icon located at the left side of the header to open the Schedule Definition dialog box.

Use the **Schedules definition** tab to specify the days and times for the job to execute.

-   Provide a name for the schedule in the **Name** field.
-   Use the **Enabled** switch to indicate for pgAgent to use the schedule (**Yes**) or to disable the schedule (**No**).
-   Use the calendar selector in the **Start** field to specify the starting date and time for the schedule.
-   Use the calendar selector in the **End** field to specify the ending date and time for the schedule.
-   Use the **Comment** field to provide a comment about the schedule.

Select the **Repeat** tab to define the days when the schedule executes in a cron-style format. The job executes on each date or time element selected on the **Repeat** tab.

In each field, select a value to add it to the list of selected values for the field. To clear the values from a field, select the X located at the right-side of the field.

-   Use the fields in the **Days** box to specify the days when the job executes:
    -   Use the **Week Days** field to select the days when the job executes.
    -   Use the **Month Days** field to select the numeric days when the job executes. Select **Last Day** to perform the job on the last day of the month, regardless of the date.
    -   Use the **Months** field to select the months when the job executes.
-   Use the fields in the **Times** box to specify the times when the job executes in hours and minutes.

Select the **Exceptions** tab to specify any days when you don't want the schedule to execute. For example, you might not want to run jobs on holidays.

Select **Add** (+) to add a row to the exception table. Then:

-   In the **Date** column, open a calendar selector and select a date when you don't want the job to execute. Specify ****&lt;Any>**** to indicate that you don't want the job to execute on any day at the time selected.
-   In the **Time** column, open a time selector and specify a time when you don't want the job to execute. Specify ****&lt;Any>**** to indicate that you don't want the job to execute at any time on the day selected.

Select the **Notifications** tab to configure the email notification settings on job level:

-   Use the **Send the notifications** field to specify when you want to send the email notifications.
-   Use the **Email group** field to specify the email group to send the email notification to.

When you finish defining the schedule, you can use the **SQL** tab to review the code that creates or modifies your job.

Select **Save** to save the job definition.

After you save a job, the job is listed under the **Jobs** node of the PEM tree of the server on which it was defined. The **Properties** tab in the PEM console displays a high-level overview of the selected job, and the **Statistics** tab shows the details of each run of the job. To modify an existing job or to review detailed information about a job, right-click a job name, and select **Properties** from the context menu.

## Agent privileges

By default, the PEM agent is installed with root privileges for the operating system host and superuser privileges for the database server. These privileges allow the PEM agent to invoke unrestricted probes on the monitored host and database server about system usage, retrieving and returning the information to the PEM server.

PEM functionality lessens as the privileges of the PEM agent decrease. For complete functionality, run the PEM agent as root. If the PEM agent is run under the database server's service account, PEM probes don't have complete access to the statistical information used to generate reports, and functionality is limited to the capabilities of that account. If the PEM agent is run under another lesser-privileged account, functionality is limited even further.

If you limit the operating system privileges of the PEM agent, some of the PEM probes don't return information, and the following functionality might be affected.

!!! Note
    The list isn't comprehensive but provides an overview of the type of functionality that's limited.

If the probe is querying the operating system without enough privileges, the probe might return a `permission denied` error. If the probe is querying the database without enough privileges, the probe might return a `permission denied` error or display the returned data in a PEM chart or graph as an empty value.

When a probe fails, an entry is written to the log file that contains the name of the probe, the reason the probe failed, and a hint that helps you resolve the problem.

You can view probe-related errors that occurred on the server in the Probe Log dashboard or review error messages in the PEM worker log files. On Linux, the default location of the log file is:

 `/var/log/pem/worker.log`

On Windows, log information is available on the Event Viewer.

## Agent configuration

A number of configurable parameters and registry entries control the behavior of the PEM agent. You might need to modify the PEM agent's parameter settings to enable some PEM functionality. After modifying values in the PEM agent configuration file, restart the PEM agent to apply any changes.

With the exception of the `PEM_MAXCONN` parameter, we strongly recommend against modifying any of these configuration parameters or registry entries without first consulting EDB support experts unless you need the modifications to enable PEM functionality.

On Linux systems, PEM configuration options are stored in the `agent.cfg` file, located in `/usr/edb/pem/agent/etc`. The `agent.cfg` file contains the following entries.

|     Parameter name      |                                                                                                                                              Description                                                                                                                                               |                                                 Default value                                                 |

### About alert threads

The number of alert threads spawned by an agent is determined by the `alert_threads` or `AlertThreads` parameter. In general, we recommend setting this parameter to 1 on the agent that resides on the PEM server and 0 for all other agents. However, on PEM server instances with very large numbers of alerts (caused by many monitored servers, many enabled alerts, or high alert frequency), it may be necessary to increase this parameter if alerts are not being evaluated at the configured frequency. In this situation, we recommend setting this parameter to around 8 on the agent that resides on the PEM server and 0 for all other agents and tuning up or down accordingly.

When tuning this parameter, it is important to understand that any agent can process any alert, so in general it is unnecessary to have a non-zero number of alert threads on more than one agent. The capacity of the PEM instance to process alerts is determined by the total number of alert thread across all agents. Increasing the number of threads on a specific agent does not give any additional performance for alerts pertaining to servers monitored by that agent.

Each alert thread opens a connection to the PEM server backend, so allocating more threads than necessary does result in additional memory and CPU usage on the PEM server.

## Agent properties

The PEM Agent Properties dialog box provides information about the PEM agent from which the dialog box was opened. To open the dialog box, right-click an agent name in the PEM client tree and select **Properties** from the context menu.

Use the PEM Agent Properties dialog box to review or modify information about the PEM agent:

-   The **Description** field displays a modifiable description of the PEM agent. This description is displayed in the tree of the PEM client.

-   You can use groups to organize your servers and agents in the PEM client tree. Use the **Group** list to select the group in which the agent is displayed.

-   Use the **Team** field to specify the name of the group role that can access servers monitored by the agent. The servers monitored by this agent are visible in the PEM client tree to connected team members. This is a convenience feature. The **Team** field doesn't provide true isolation. Don't use it for security purposes.

-   The **Heartbeat interval** fields display the length of time that elapses between reports from the PEM agent to the PEM server. Use the selectors next to the **Minutes** or **Seconds** fields to modify the interval.

    Use the **Job Notifications** tab to configure the email notification settings on agent level:

    -   Use the **Override default configuration?** switch to specify if you want the agent level job notification settings to override the default job notification settings. Select **Yes** to enable the rest of the settings on this dialog box to define when and to whom to send the job notifications. 
    -   Use the **Email on job completion?** switch to specify whether to send the job notification when the job completes successfully.
    -   Use the **Email on a job failure?** switch to specify whether to send the job notification when the job fails.
    -   Use the **Email group** field to specify the email group to send the job notification to.

    The **Agent Configurations** tab displays all the current configurations and capabilities of an agent.

    -   The **Parameter** column displays a list of parameters.
    -   The **Value** column displays the current value of the corresponding parameter.
    -   The **Category** column displays the category of the corresponding parameter. It can be either **configuration** or **capability**.
