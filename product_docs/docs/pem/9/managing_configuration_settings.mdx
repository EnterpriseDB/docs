Postgres Enterprise Manager reads multiple configuration files at startup:

-   `config.py` &mdash; This is the main configuration file. Don't modify it. You can use it as a reference for configuration settings that one of the following files might be override.
-   `config_distro.py` &mdash; This file is read after `config.py` and is intended for packagers to change any settings that are required for their Postgres Enterprise Manager distribution. This typically includes certain paths and file locations. This file is optional. Packagers can create it in the same directory as `config.py` if it's needed.
-   `config_local.py` &mdash; This file is read after `config_distro.py` and is intended for end users to change any default or packaging specific settings that they want to adjust to meet local preferences or standards. This file is optional. Create it in the same directory as `config.py` if it's needed.

A copy of the default `config.py` file is included in the PEM online help for reference.
