## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  - To set up the EDB repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

  - To set up the PostgreSQL community repository, go to [yum](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/redhat/) or [apt](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt).

  !!! Note
  The PostgreSQL community repository is required only if you are using PostgreSQL as the backend database for PEM server.

- Install the Postgres server. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server on Linux](/epas/latest/installing/) or [Installing PostgreSQL](/supported-open-source/postgresql/installer/).

- Review other [Linux installation prerequisites](/pem/latest/installing/prerequisites/) for PEM.

## Install the package

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-pem
```

## Initial configuration

```shell
# You can configure the PEM server using the following command:
sudo /usr/edb/pem/bin/configure-pem-server.sh
```

For more details, see [Configuring the PEM server on Linux](/pem/latest/installing/configuring_the_pem_server_on_linux/).

!!! Note

    - The operating system user pem is created while installing the PEM server. The PEM server web application is a WSGI application, which runs under Apache HTTPD. The pem application data and the session is saved to this user's home directory.
