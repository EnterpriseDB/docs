To install a Postgres Enterprise Manager server on Linux, you may need to perform some preliminary configuration:
    
1. Configure authentication on the Postgres server by updating the `pg_hba.conf` file. The `pg_hba.conf` file manages connections. Verify that the `pg_hba.conf` file allows connections from the PEM server, the monitoring PEM agent, and the host of the Apache web server server. Pointers for configuring access:
  
    - PEM server connects to the PEM backend database as a superuser using password authentication. On Linux platforms, this requires you to add a new superuser that authenticates using a password.

    - To allow the new superuser to connect using password authentication, add a line `pg_hba.conf` that allows `host` connections using `md5` or `scram-sha-256` authentication.

    - If you're using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, see [Modifying the pg_hba.conf file](/pem/latest/managing_database_server/#modifying-the-pg_hbaconf-file).

    - If you're using PostgreSQL, see [Client Authentication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

2.  Verify that the `sslutils` extension and `hstore contrib` module are installed on your Postgres server.

    -   If you're using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the `hstore contrib` module is installed by default. You can install the `sslutils` extension:

        For RHEL/AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux 8:
          
        ```shell
        dnf install edb-as<x>-server-sslutils
        ```

        Where `<x>` is the EDB Postgres Advanced server version.

        For RHEL/OL/CentOS 7:
          
        ```shell
        yum install edb-as<x>-server-sslutils
        ```

        Where `<x>` is the EDB Postgres Advanced server version.

        For Debian/Ubuntu:
          
        ```shell
        apt install edb-as<x>-server-sslutils
        ```

        Where `<x>` is the EDB Postgres Advanced server version.

        For SLES:
          
        ```shell
        zypper install edb-as<x>-server-sslutils
        ```

        Where `<x>` is the EDB Postgres Advanced server version.

    -   If you're using PostgreSQL, make sure you have access to the PostgreSQL community repository ([yum](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/redhat/), [apt](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Apt)), and then install the `sslutils` extension and the `hstore contrib` module: 

        For RHEL/AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux 8:
          
        ```shell
        dnf install sslutils_<x> postgresql<x>-contrib
        ```

        Where `<x>` is the Postgres server version.

        For RHEL/OL/CentOS 7:
          
        ```shell
        yum install sslutils_<x> postgresql<x>-contrib
        ```

        Where `<x>` is the Postgres server version.

        For Debian/Ubuntu:
          
        ```shell
        apt install postgresql-<x>-sslutils
        ```

        Where `<x>` is the Postgres server version.

        For SLES:
          
        ```shell
        zypper install sslutils_<x> postgresql<x>-contrib
        ```

        Where `<x>` is the Postgres server version.

    !!! Note For Debian and Ubuntu users     
        The postgres community repository for apt (used by Debian and Ubuntu) does not include `sslutils` and therefore this must be installed from the EDB repository along with [PEM](/installing_pem_server_using_edb_repository/index.mdx).
          
        Debian 10 and Ubuntu 20 changed the requirements for accepting certificates.

          -   If you want to install the PEM agent on a machine with an old version of sslutils, then you must upgrade sslutils to 1.3. Version 1.3 has a 4096-bit RSA key and sha256 signature algorithm support added to it.
          -   If you don't upgrade sslutils to 1.3, then PEM agent might fail to connect to the PEM backend database server, and it might log the error "ca md too weak."

  3.  If you're using a firewall, allow access to port 8443 on the Postgres server:

     For RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux/OL/CentOS/SLES:

    ```shell
    firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-port=8443/tcp
         
    firewall-cmd --reload
    ```
       
    For Debian/Ubuntu:

    ```shell
    iptables -t filter -A INPUT -p TCP --dport 8443 -j ACCEPT
    ```

4. Make sure the components Postgres Enterprise Manager depends on, such as python3, libboost, openssl (1.0.2k or later), snmp++, and libcurl, are up to date: 

     For RHEL/AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux 8:

     ```shell
     dnf upgrade
     ```

     For RHEL/OL/CentOS 7:
   
     ```shell
    yum upgrade
    ```

    For Debian/Ubuntu:
   
    ```shell
    apt-get update
    ```

    For SLES:
   
   ```shell
   zypper update
   ```

## Supported locales

Currently, the Postgres Enterprise Manager server and web interface support a locale of `English(US) en_US` and use of a period (.) as a language separator character. Using an alternate locale or a separator character other than a period might cause errors.
