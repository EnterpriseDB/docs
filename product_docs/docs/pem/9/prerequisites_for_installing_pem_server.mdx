For optimum performance when monitoring servers and rendering dashboards, we recommend installing PEM on a system with at least:

-   4 CPU cores
-   8 GB of RAM
-   100 GB of storage

Additional disk space is required for data storage. Resource use varies based on the probes that are defined and enabled and the activity level on the monitored databases. Monitoring server resources as you use PEM lets you know when you need to expand your initial system configuration.
