title: "Postgres Enterprise Manager 9.8.0 release notes"
navTitle: Version 9.8.0
---

Released: 19th Nov 2024
!!! Note
This release contains a fix for a bug that prevented some historical data from being correctly purged when its configured retention time expired.
Therefore, it is likely that the first purge job to run after this update will delete more data than usual and may take longer to complete. 
The purge job should start within 3 hours of the upgrade.
You may also notice that the total size of your PEM database shrinks significantly once this job and subsequent vacuuming is complete.
!!!

New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in PEM 9.8.0 include:

| Type         | Description                                                                                                                                               |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhancement  | Added support for EDB Advanced Server, EDB Postgres Distributed, and PostgreSQL 17.                                                                       |
| Enhancement  | Added support for RHEL9 ARM64 platform.                                                                                                                   |
| Enhancement  | Added support to allow sslmode connections from PEM agent to PEM server.                                                                                  |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue for PEM port while registering the server. Now `pemworker` picks up the PEM port from the agent config file while registering the server.  |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where PEM agent installation on Windows was failing if a `%` character was used to set the service for the agent.                          |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where some historical probe data was not purged because the system job that tracks data for purging would be erroneously deleted by another system job.                                                                                         |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue for displaying errors on EINTR signal. Now spoolers `select()` error will be displayed on EINTR signal only when log level is set to INFO. |
