!!! Note

    Postgres Enterprise Manager 8.3 and later is supported on SLES.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the EDB repository. For more information, see [getting started with repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/repos/getting_started/).

- Activate the required SUSE module:

  ```shell
  # You can use SLES 15 SP3 for PEM 8.3 and later:
  sudo SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.3/ppc64le

  # You can use SLES 15 SP4 for PEM 8.6 and later:
  sudo SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.4/ppc64le

  ```

- Refresh the metadata:
  ```shell
  sudo zypper refresh
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo zypper -n install edb-pem-agent
```

After installing PEM agent, you need to register the PEM agent. For detailed information see [Registering an agent](../../registering_agent/).
