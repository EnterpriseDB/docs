## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the EDB repository.

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

  To determine if your repository exists, enter:

  `dnf repolist | grep enterprisedb`

  If no output is generated, the repository isn't installed.

  To set up the EDB repository:

  1. Go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).

  1. Select the button that provides access to the EDB repository.

  1. Select the platform and software that you want to download.

  1. Follow the instructions for setting up the EDB repository.

## Install the package

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-pem-agent
```

After installing PEM agent, you need to register the PEM agent. For detailed information see [Registering an agent](../../registering_agent/).
