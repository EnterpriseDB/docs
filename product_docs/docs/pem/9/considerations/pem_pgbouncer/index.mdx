You can use pgBouncer as a connection pooler for limiting the number of connections from the PEM agent to the Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) server on non-Windows machine:

-   Preparing the PEM Database Server provides information about preparing the PEM database server to be used with pgBouncer.
-   Configuring pgBouncer provides detailed information about configuring pgBouncer to make it work with the PEM database server.
-   Configuring the PEM agent provides detailed information about configuring a PEM agent to connect to pgBouncer.

For detailed information about using the PEM web interface, see the [Accessing the web interface ](../../pem_web_interface).
