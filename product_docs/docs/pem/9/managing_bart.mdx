The EDB Backup and Recovery Tool (BART) is an administrative utility providing simplified backup and recovery management for multiple local or remote EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL database servers. For more information about BART, see [Backup and Recovery Tool](/bart/latest).

This feature is built into the Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) web interface and makes it easier for you to monitor and manage BART.

In PEM version 7.10 and later, you can manage a BART server and perform all the BART operations through the PEM console. 

## Prerequisites

-  Before adding a BART server to the PEM console, you must manually install and configure BART on the BART host. For more information about installing and configuring BART, see [BART installation](/bart/latest/bart_inst/).

!!! Note
    While integrating PEM with BART, the PEM agent creates the backup directory required for BART and ensures that the ownership and permissions on the directory are correct.

-  Before associating a database server with a BART server, you must install SSH on the database server and the BART server.

-  Before restoring a BART backup, you must install BART, a PEM agent, and SSH on the target server. SSH must also be installed on the BART server that you plan to use to restore.

-  To take a backup of the replica database servers, ensure that the latest pg_basebackup utility is installed on the database server that you want to manage through BART.

## Configuring a BART server

You can use the Create–BART Server dialog box to register an existing BART server with the PEM server. To open the dialog box, right-click the BART Servers node and select **Create-BART Server**.

Use the **General** tab to describe the general properties of the BART server:

-   Use the **Agent Name** field to select the agent that you want to use for the BART server. Only those PEM agents that are supported for BART are listed.

-   Use the **Server Name** field to specify a name for the server. The name specified identifies the server in the Browser tree.

-   Use the **Host** field to specify the IP address of the host or agent where BART is installed.

-   Use the **User** field to specify the user name to use for performing all the BART operations. You can use the enterprisedb (for EDB Postgres Advanced Server) or postgres (for PostgreSQL) database user account, or you can create a new BART user account. This user must be an operating system user who owns the BART backup catalog directory.

-   Use the **Installation path** field to specify the directory path where BART is installed on the host or BART server.

-   Use the **Backup path** field to specify the file system parent directory to store all BART backups and archived WAL files.

-   Use the **pg_basebackup_path** field to specify the path to the pg_basebackup utility.

-   Use the **Xlog/WAL method** field to specify how to collect the transaction log while pg_basebackup executes. The default option is **fetch**, which specifies to collect the transaction log files after the backup has completed. Set the **Xlog/WAL** method to **stream** to stream the transaction log in parallel with the full base backup creation. If streaming is used, the `max_wal_senders` configuration parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file for affected database servers must account for an additional session for the streaming of the transaction log. The setting must be a minimum of 2.

    For more information about Xlog/WAL methods, see [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgbasebackup.html).

-   Use the **Retention policy** field to specify the retention policy for the backup. This policy determines when to mark an active backup as obsolete and hence a candidate for deletion. You can specify the retention policy in terms of number of backup or in terms of duration (days, weeks, or months).

-   Use the optional **Log file** field to specify the path to BART log file.

Use the **Misc** tab to describe the backup-related properties of the BART server:

-   Use the **Scanner log file** field to specify the path to the Xlog/WAL scanner log file. BART creates a log scanner file only if you specify the path.

-   Use the **Socket dir path** field to specify the path to the socket directory to store all BART sockets. The default directory is `/tmp`. This parameter is added from BART version 2.5.2 and later.

-   Use the **Socket name** field to specify the BART socket file name. Using this option overrides the default BART socket name generated using MD5 checksum. This parameter is added in BART version 2.5.6 and later.

-   Use the **WAL compression?** switch to specify if you want to compress the archived Xlog/WAL files in Gzip format. To enable WAL compression, the gzip compression program must be present in the BART user account’s PATH. Don't enable the WAL compression setting for database servers where you need to take incremental backups.

-   Use the **Copy WALs during restore?** field to specify how the archived WAL files are collected when invoking the RESTORE operation. Set to **Enabled** to copy the archived WAL files from the BART backup catalog to the `restore_path/archived_wals` directory prior to the database server archive recovery. Set to **Disabled** to retrieve the archived WAL files directly from the BART backup catalog during the database server archive recovery. Enabling this option helps you save time during the restore operation.

-   Use the **Thread count** field to specify the number of worker threads for copying blocks or data files from the database server to the BART backup catalog. Specify a thread count of 1 if you want to take the backup using the pg_basebackup utility.

-   Use the **Batch size** field to specify the number of blocks of memory used for copying modified blocks. This applies only to incremental backups.

-   Use the **Scan interval** field to specify the number of seconds to wait before the WAL scanner scans the new WAL files.

-   Use the **MBM scan timeout** field to specify the number of seconds to wait for MBM files before timing out. This applies only to incremental backups.

-   Use the **Workers** field to specify the number of parallel worker processes required to stream the modified blocks of an incremental backups to the restore host.

## Associating the BART server with a database server

After configuring the BART server, you must associate it with the database server whose backup you want to manage with BART. You can either:

-   Use the PEM console to modify the properties of an existing monitored database server to map it to the newly configured BART server.

-   Use the PEM console to create a new monitored database server and map it to the newly configured BART server.

To map the BART server to a new PEM database server, right-click the PEM Server Directory node and select **Create > Server**. Enter the details on all the generic tabs and then enter the BART-specific details on the **BART** tab.

Use the **General** tab to describe the general properties of the BART Server that map to the PEM server:

-   Use the **BART server** field to select the BART server name. All the BART servers configured in the PEM console are listed.

-   Use the **Server name** field to specify a name for the database server that you want to back up using the BART server. This name is stored in the BART configuration file.

-   Use the **Description** field to specify the description of the database server.

-   Use the **Backup name** field to specify a template for user-defined names to assign to the backups of the database server. If you don't specify a backup name template, then the backup can be referenced in BART sub-commands only by the BART-assigned, integer backup identifier.

-   Use the **Host address** field to specify the IP address of the database server that you want to configure for backup.

-   Use the **Port** field to specify the port to use for the database that you want to backup.

-   Use the **User** field to specify the user of the database that you want to back up using BART through the PEM console. If you want to enable incremental backups for this database server, then the user must be a superuser.

-   Use the **Password** field to specify the password for the user of the database that you want to back up.

-   Use the **Cluster Owner** field to specify the Linux operating system user account that owns the database cluster. This is typically enterprisedb for EDB Postgres Advanced Server database clusters installed in the Oracle databases compatible mode. It is postgres for PostgreSQL database clusters and for EDB Postgres Advanced Server database clusters installed in the PostgreSQL databases compatible mode.

-   Use the **Archive command** field to specify the desired format of the archive command string to use in the `bart.cfg` file. Inputs provided for the archive command overwrite the database server's `Postgresql.conf` file. Once the server is added, the database server restarts or database configurations are reloaded.

-   Use the **Archive path** field to store the archived WAL files. The default location is the BART backup catalog. This parameter is in BART version 2.5.2 and later.

-   Use the **Allow incremental backup?** switch to specify whether to enable incremental backup for this database server.

-   Use the **Setup passwordless SSH?** switch to specify if you want to create SSH certificates to allow passwordless logins between the database server and the BART server. Be sure to bind a PEM agent before setting up the passwordless SSH authentication. Passwordless SSH doesn't work for a database server being remotely monitored by a PEM agent.

Use the fields on the **Misc** tab to describe the miscellaneous properties of the BART server:

-   Use the **Override default configuration?** switch to specify if you want to override the BART server configurations with the specific database server configurations.

-   Use the **Xlog** method to specify how to collect the transaction log while `pg_basebackup` executes.

-   Use the **Retention policy** field to specify the retention policy for the backup. This policy determines when to mark an active backup as obsolete and hence a candidate for deletion. You can specify the retention policy in terms of number of backup or in terms of duration (days, weeks, or months).

-   Use the **WAL compression** switch to specify if you want to compress the archived Xlog/WAL files in Gzip format. To enable WAL compression, the gzip compression program must be present in the BART user account’s PATH. The wal_compression setting must not be enabled for those database servers where you need to take incremental backups.

-   Use the **Copy WALs during restore** field to specify how the archived WAL files are collected when invoking the RESTORE operation. Set to enabled to copy the archived WAL files from the BART backup catalog to the `<;restore_path>/archived_wals` directory prior to the database server archive recovery. Set to disabled to retrieve the archived WAL files directly from the BART backup catalog during the database server archive recovery.

-   Use the **Thread count** field to specify the number of threads to copy the blocks. You must set the thread count to 1 if you want to take a backup with the pg_basebackup utility.

-   Use the **Batch size** field to specify the number of blocks of memory used for copying modified blocks. This option applies only to incremental backups.

-   Use the **Scan interval** field to specify the number of seconds for the WAL scanner to wait before scanning the new WAL files.

-   Use the **MBM scan timeout** field to specify the number of seconds to wait for MBM files before timing out. This option applies only to incremental backups.

-   Use the **Workers** field to specify the number of parallel worker processes required to stream the modified blocks of an incremental backups to the restore host.

## Viewing the BART server details on a PEM dashboard

After associating the BART server with a database server, you can review the backup and restore details for that server on the PEM dashboard. You can also perform operations such as restoring or deleting a backup that's listed on the dashboard.

When you select a monitored BART server, details of all the associated database servers along with their backups and restore activities are displayed as a chart on the dashboard in the Backup and Restore Activities panel. You can filter the list of backups on criteria specified in the filter boxes (database server, activity, or duration).

The Managed Database Servers panel displays a list of all the database servers managed by a BART server along with their high-level details.

The Initiated Server Backups panel displayes a list of all the backups of the database servers managed by a BART server. You can filter the list to display the details of any database server. You can also filter the list on criteria that you specify in the filter box. Typically, this filter works with any kind of string value (excluding date, time, and size) listed under the columns. For example, you can type `tar` to filter the list and display only those backups that are in tar format.

Backup details displayed include the Backup Name, Backup ID, Status, Server Name, Start Time, Type, Parent ID, Format, Duration, and Size. The Status column shows the status of the backups. Status can be one of the following: In Progress, Active, Keep, or Obsolete.

A backup is marked as Obsolete when the backup retention period has passed or if the number of retained backups (specified as the retention policy of the BART server) is met. If you want to make an exception so that a particular backup doesn't get marked as Obsolete even after the retention policy expires, mark that backup as Keep. Similarly, if you mark a particular backup as NoKeep, the backup is reevaluated to determine whether to change its status back to Obsolete based on the current retention policy.

If any of the scheduled tasks for backup, restore, validate host, validate server, or delete obsolete backup for any of the BART server is deleted, it doesn't appear under the BART Tool Activities graph of the BART server's dashboard. However, it is listed under the **Initiated Server Backups** list.

A pin in the first column under Actions indicates that you can mark a backup as Keep by selecting the pin. An inverted pin indicates that you can mark the backup as NoKeep. The second column under Actions displays the **Restore** icon, which you can select to perform the restore operation.

You can delete all the obsolete backups by selecting **Delete Obsolete**. You can also refresh the list of backups by selecting **Refresh**.

## Scheduling BART backups

To create or manage a backup, select **Tools > Schedule Backup**. The dialog box header displays general execution information about the backup. Select the plus sign (+) to add information about a scheduled backup. Enter the backup details in the schedule definition dialog.
