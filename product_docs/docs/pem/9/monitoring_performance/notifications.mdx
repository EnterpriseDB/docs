PEM can send a notification or execute a script if an alert is triggered or cleared. You can send notifications using the following options:

-   SMTP
-   Webhooks
-   SNMP
-   Nagios

Use the **Notification** tab to specify PEM behavior when an alert is raised.

## SMTP

You must configure the PEM server to use an SMTP server to deliver email before PEM can send email notifications.

### Creating an email group

PEM monitors your system for conditions that require attention. You can use an email group to specify the email addresses of users for the server to notify if current values deviate from threshold values specified in an alert definition. An email group can notify multiple users or target specific users during the time periods you specify.

Use the **Email Groups** tab to configure groups of SMTP email recipients. To open the **Email Groups** tab, in the PEM client, select **Management > Manage Alerts**. When the **Manage Alerts** tab opens, select **Email Groups** from the Quick Links toolbar.

The **Email Groups** tab displays a list of the currently defined email groups. To modify an existing group, select a group name and select **Edit** at the far left end of the row.

To define a new email group, select the plus sign (+) in the upper-right corner of the **Email Groups** table. Use the Email Groups dialog box to define an email group and its members.

Each row in the email group definition associates a set of email addresses with a specific time period. When an alert is triggered, the server evaluates the times specified in each row and sends the message to those group members whose definitions are associated with the time that the alert triggered.

1.  Provide a name for the email group in the **Group Name** field.

1.  To open the **Options** tab, select the plus sign (+) in the group members table.

1.  Add the member addresses to receive notifications for the time period specified:

    -   Enter a comma-delimited list of recipient addresses in the **Reply to Addresses** field.
    -   Enter a comma-delimited list of addresses to receive a copy of the email in the **CC Addresses** field.
    -   Enter a comma-delimited list of addresses to receive a copy of the email without the knowledge of other  recipients in the **Bcc Addresses** field.
    -   Enter the email address to send the messages from in the **From Address** field.
    -   Use the **Subject prefix** field to provide a message to add to the start of each subject line when a notification is sent.
    -   Use the **From Time** and **To Time** selectors to specify the time range for notifications to the group members that are identified on this row. Provide these values in the locale of the PEM client host. The PEM server translates the time into other time zones as required.

1. Select **Add** to add a row to the table, and specify another time period and the email addresses to notify during those hours. 

1. When you've finished defining the email group, select **Save**.

After creating the email group, you can use the **Manage Alerts** tab to set up the notification details for an alert to direct notifications to the group.

### Deleting an email group

To delete an email group, in the Email Group table, select the name of the group and select **Delete**, located to the left of the group name.

The group name appears in the Email Group table in red. Select **Save** to permanently remove the group from the table.

## Webhook

You must configure the PEM Server to use webhooks to receive notification of alert events on threshold value violations in your configured applications.

### Creating a webhook

PEM monitors your system for conditions that require user attention. You can use a webhook to create the endpoints to receive a notification if current values deviate from threshold values specified in an alert definition. Based on the events triggered, PEM sends a notification to multiple webhook endpoints or to specific target webhook endpoints.

Use the **Webhooks** tab to configure endpoint recipients. To open the **Webhooks** tab, select **Management > Manage Alerts**. From the **Manage Alerts** tab, on the Quick Links toolbar, select **Webhooks**.

The **Webhooks** tab displays a list of the currently defined recipient applications as endpoints. Select an endpoint and select **Edit** at the far left end of the row to modify an existing endpoint.

To define a new webhook, select the plus sign (+) in the upper-right corner of the table. You can then use the **General** tab to define the basic details of the webhook:

-   Provide a name for the webhook in the **Name** field.
-   Specify a webhook URL to deliver all the notifications to in the **URL** field.
-   Set the request method type used to make the call in the **Request Method** field: **POST** or **PUT**.
-   By default, webhooks are enabled. To disable a webhook, set **Enable?** to **No**.

!!! Note
    The **Enable?** setting works only if the `enable_webhook` parameter is set to `true` in the `agent.cfg` file. By default, the `enable_webhook` parameter is set to `true` only for the agent running on the PEM server host. For all other agents running on other hosts, you need to set it to `true` manually.

### Defining webhook SSL configurations

You can define the webhook SSL parameters in the respective agent configuration file or registry in Windows. You can find the list of webhook SSL parameters in [PEM agent configuration parameters](../managing_pem_agent/modifying_agent_configuration). If you add or remove any of the agent configuration parameters, you must restart the agent to apply them.

-   On Windows systems, PEM registry entries for webhooks are located in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\EnterpriseDB\PEM\agent\WEBHOOK`.
-   On Linux systems, PEM configuration options for webhooks are stored in the `agent.cfg file`, located by default in `/usr/edb/pem/agent/etc`.

![Example - Webhook SSL Parameters in agent.cfg file](../images/webhook_ssl_config.png)

![Example - Webhook SSL Parameters in windows registry](../images/webhook_ssl_config_windows.png)

### Defining webhook headers

Use the **HTTP Headers** tab to define the header parameters to pass while calling the webhook endpoints:

-   Specify all the values as a key and value pair.
-   Specify a key parameter in the **Key** field and a value in the **Value** field.
-   To add HTTP headers, select the plus sign (+) in the upper-right corner of the HTTP Headers table.
-   To delete HTTP headers, select **Delete** to the left of **Key**. The header remains in the list but in strike-through font. Select **Save** to permanently delete the headers.
-   To edit the HTTP headers, select **Edit** to the left of **Key**.

### Defining webhook payloads

Use the **Payload** tab to define the JSON data to send to the endpoint when an alert is triggered:

-   **Type** specifies data to send in the format type, that is, JSON.

-   Use **Template** to configure JSON data sent to endpoints. In the template, you can use placeholders for the following:

    -   `%AlertID%` &mdash; The id of the triggered alert.
    -   `%AlertName%` &mdash; The name of the triggered alert.
    -   `%ObjectName%` &mdash; The name of the server or agent on which the alert was triggered.
    -   `%ObjectType%` &mdash; The type on which the alert was generated.
    -   `%ThresholdValue%` &mdash; The threshold value reached by the metric when the alert triggered.
    -   `%CurrentValue%` &mdash; The current value of the metric that triggered the alert.
    -   `%CurrentState%` &mdash; The current state of the alert.
    -   `%OldState%` &mdash; The previous state of the alert.
    -   `%AlertRaisedTime%` &mdash; The time that the alert was raised or the most recent time that the alert state changed.
    -   `%AgentID%` &mdash; The id of the agent by which the alert was generated.
    -   `%AgentName%` &mdash; The name of the agent by which the alert was generated.
    -   `%ServerID%` &mdash; The id of the server on which the alert was generated.
    -   `%ServerName%` &mdash; The name of the server on which the alert was generated.
    -   `%ServerIP%` &mdash; The ip or address of the server on which the alert was generated.
    -   `%ServerPort%` &mdash; The the port of the server on which the alert was generated.
    -   `%DatabaseName%` &mdash; The name of the database on which the alert was generated.
    -   `%SchemaName%` &mdash; The name of the schema on which the alert was generated.
    -   `%PackageName%` &mdash; The name of the package on which the alert was generated.
    -   `%DatabaseObjectName%` &mdash; The name of the database object, like table name or function name, on which the alert was generated.
    -   `%Parameters%` &mdash; The list of custom parameters used to generate the alert.
    -   `%AlertInfo%` &mdash; The detailed database object-level information of the alert.

-   Select **Test Connection** to test notification delivery to the mentioned endpoint.

### Defining webhook alert levels

Use the **Notifications** tab to specify an alert level for webhook endpoints:

-   Set **All alerts** to **Yes** to enable all alert levels to send notifications.
-   To send a notification when a specific alert level is reached, set the slider next to an alert level to **Yes**. You must set **All alerts** to **No** to configure an individual alert level.

### Example: Sending notifications to Slack

In Slack, follow the instructions in [Getting started with incoming webhooks](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks) to:
- Create a Slack app.
- Activate incoming webhooks for that app.
- Add a webhook that posts to a channel or user of your choice.

The new webhook has a unique URL similar to `https://hooks.slack.com/services/x/y/z`. You can now configure PEM to send notifications to this URL.

In PEM, [create a new webhook](#creating-a-webhook), give it a descriptive name, and copy the URL you obtained earlier to the **URL** field.
Ensure that **Request method** is set to **POST** and **Enable?** is set to **Yes**. Set all the sliders under **Alert Notifications** to **Yes**.

Add a header under HTTP headers with the key `Content-Type` and the value `application/json`.

Under **Payload**, delete the default template and specify a template with `text` as the top-level key as in the following example:

```
{"text": "%AlertName% on %ObjectType% %ObjectName% is now %CurrentState%"}
```

You can now test the connection. If it succeeds, PEM issues a notification, and the template you specified appears in your Slack channel as a message.

Save the webhook and continue using PEM as usual. PEM now sends all the alerts to your Slack channel.

### Deleting a webhook

To mark a webhook for deletion, in the Webhooks table, select the webhook name and select **Delete** to the left of the name. The alert remains in the list but in strikethrough font.

**Delete** is a toggle. You can undo the deletion by selecting **Delete** a second time. Select **Save** to permanently delete the webhook definition.

## SNMP

You must configure the PEM server to send the notifications to an SNMP trap/notification receiver before notifications can be sent. Set the SNMP ver to v1, v2, or v3 to identify the SNMP version.

### Example - Configure `SNMP V3` traps with `net-snmp` trap receiver

1.  Set `snmp_security_engine_id` to `PEM_SNMP_AGENT` in plain text format in the Server Configuration dialog box. 

1.  Convert the plain text value to hexadecimal format to use it in `snmptrapd.conf` file. (You can have hexadecimal values of `snmp_security_engine_id` up to 32 octets length).
    ```shell
       echo PEM_SNMP_AGENT | hexdump -v -e '/1 "%02X"'
       50454D5F534E4D505F4147454E540A
    ```

1.  Set the following parameters in the Server Configuration dialog box:   
    -   **snmp_security_nam** to **pem_snmp_user**
    -   **snmp_authentication_protocol** to **MD5**
    -   **snmp_authentication_password** to **pem_auth_pass**
    -   **snmp_privacy_protocol** to **DES**
    -   **snmp_privacy_password** to **pem_priv_pass**

1.   The `snmptrapd.conf` file has the following values:

    ```shell
       createUser -e 0x50454D5F534E4D505F4147454E540A pem_snmp_user MD5 pem_auth_pass DES pem_priv_pass
       authUser log pem_snmp_user
    ```
!!!note
The agent must run as root to allow sending notifications with SNMP V3.
!!!

## Using PEM with Nagios

The PEM server can send a passive alert result to Nagios network-alerting software when a user-defined alert is triggered. To instruct the PEM server to notify Nagios of a triggered alert, you must:

-   Enable Nagios notification for each alert that triggers a notification from the PEM server to Nagios. You must configure PEM alerting before you create the `host.cfg` and `services.cfg` files.
-   Configure Nagios-related behaviors of the PEM server.
-   Create the `host.cfg` and `services.cfg` configuration files.
-   If necessary, modify the Nagios configuration file and restart the Nagios server.
-   Install the PEM agent on the system where the Nagios server is installed and register it with the PEM Server. Set `enable_nagios` configuration to `true` in the `agent.cfg` file for that agent, and restart the agent service.

After configuring the server to enable Nagios alerting, any triggered alerts send a passive check result to the Nagios service. The syntax of a passive alert is:

`<timestamp> PROCESS_SERVICE_CHECK_RESULT; <host_name> ; <service_name> ; <service_status> ;`

Where:

`timestamp` is the date and time that the alert was triggered.

`host_name` is the name of the server or agent.

`service_name` is the name of the alert.

`service_status` is the numeric service status value:

-  0 if the service status is OK
-  1 if the service status is WARNING
-  2 if the service status is CRITICAL
-  3 if the service status is UNKNOWN

The PEM server uses the following rules to evaluate the service status:

-   If the PEM alert level is CLEARED, the warning message reads OK.
-   If the PEM alert level is LOW, the warning message reads WARNING.
-   If the `is_nagios_medium_alert_as_critical` flag (specified in the PEM server configuration dialog box) is set to FALSE and the alert level MEDIUM, the warning message reads WARNING.
-   If the `is_nagios_medium_alert_as_critical` flag (specified in the PEM server configuration dialog box) is set to TRUE and the alert level is MEDIUM, the warning message reads CRITICAL.
-   If the PEM alert level is HIGH, the warning message reads CRITICAL.

### Enabling Nagios notification for an alert

The PEM server maintains a unique set of notification properties for each enabled alert. Use the **Notification** tab of the **Manage Alerts** tab to specify that, when triggered, a given alert sends an alert notice to Nagios.

To modify the notification properties of an alert, right-click the name of the object monitored by the alert, and select **Management > Manage Alerts**. On the **Manage Alerts** tab, select **Edit** to the left of the alert name in the Alerts list. When the edit pane opens, select the **Notification** tab.

To enable Nagios notification, move the slider next to **Submit passive service check result to Nagios** to **Yes**. Then select **Save**.

### Configuring Nagios-related behavior of the PEM Server

You can use the Server Configuration dialog box to provide information about your Nagios configuration to the PEM server. To open dialog box, select **Management > Server Configuration**.

Four server configuration parameters specify information about your Nagios installation and PEM server behavior related to Nagios:

-   Use the `nagios_cmd_file_name` parameter to specify the location of the Nagios pipeline file that receives passive check alerts from PEM. The default value of this parameter is `/usr/local/nagios/var/rw/nagios.cmd`. If your `nagios.cmd` file resides elsewhere, specify the file location in the **Value** field.

-   Move the slider in the `nagios_enabled` parameter to **Yes** to instruct the PEM server to send passive check alerts to Nagios.

-   Use the `nagios_medium_alert_as_critical` slider to specify the warning severity that the PEM server passes to Nagios if a medium alert is triggered:

    -   If the `is_nagios_medium_alert_as_critical` flag is set to **FALSE** and the alert level is **MEDIUM**, the warning message reads WARNING.

    -   If the `is_nagios_medium_alert_as_critical` flag is set to **TRUE** and the alert level is **MEDIUM**, the warning message reads CRITICAL.

-   Use the `nagios_spool_retention_time` parameter to specify the number of days of notification history to store on the PEM server. The default value is 7 days.

After modifying parameter values, select **Save** in the upper-right corner of the dialog box.

### Creating the hosts.cfg and services.cfg file

The `templates.cfg` file (by default, located in `/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects`) specifies the properties of a generic host and generic service. The properties specify the parameters used in the `hosts.cfg` and `services.cfg` files.

In most cases (when PEM is installed in a default configuration), you don't need to modify the `templates.cfg` file before creating the `hosts.cfg` and `services.cfg` files. If necessary, you can modify the `templates.cfg` file to specify alternative values for parameters or to create new templates.

Before modifying the Nagios configuration file, use the following command to create a `hosts.cfg` file that contains information about the PEM hosts that reside on the local system:

`psql -U postgres -p 5433 -d pem -A -t -c "select pem.create_nagios_host_config('generic-host')" > /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/hosts.cfg`

Then, use the following command to create a `services.cfg` file that contains information about the PEM services that reside on the local system:

`psql -U postgres -p 5433 -d pem -A -t -c "select pem.create_nagios_service_config('generic-service')" > /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/services.cfg`

If you want to use a `custom template.cfg` file entry, specify the entry name in place of `generic-host` or `generic-service` in these commands.

### Modifying the Nagios configuration file

After creating the `host.cfg` and `services.cfg` files, you must specify their location in the Nagios configuration file (by default, `/usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg`). Modify the configuration file, adding entries that specify the location of the files:

`cfg_file=/usr/local/etc/objects/hosts.cfg`

`cfg_file=/usr/local/etc/objects/services.cfg`

You can use the following command to confirm that Nagios is properly configured:

`/usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg`

After confirming that Nagios is configured correctly, restart the Nagios service:

`/usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -d /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg`

## Customizing email templates

PEM monitors your system for conditions that require user attention and sends email notifications. Use **Email Templates** to customize the email subject and the payload that the server sends if the current values deviate from the threshold values specified by an alert.

These are the default email templates that are customizable:

- Alert detected
- Alert level increased
- Alert level decreased
- Alert cleared
- Alert reminder
- Job success
- Job failure
- Job cancellation
- Job step
- Job step (Database server)

To customize the email template, select the edit button next to the email template name. As needed, edit the **Subject** and **Payload** fields from the available list of placeholders. After modifying the field values, select **Save**.

If any of the default email templates are customized, then a green tick mark is displayed for that template in the `Custom Template?` column on the **Email Templates** tab.

To restore the customized email template as the default template, select the custom template and select the undo button at the top of the **Email Templates** tab.
