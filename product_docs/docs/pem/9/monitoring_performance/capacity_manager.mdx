PEM's Capacity Manager analyzes collected statistics (metrics) to generate a graph or table that displays the historical usage statistics of an object. It can also project the anticipated usage statistics for an object. You can configure Capacity Manager to collect and analyze metrics for a specific host, server, database, or database object.

You can tailor the content of the Capacity Manager report by choosing:

-  Specific metrics to include in the report
-  The time range over which the metrics were gathered 
-  A high or low threshold for the metrics analyzed 

You can also specify a start and end date for the Capacity Manager report. If the end date of the report specifies a time in the future, Capacity Manager analyzes the historical usage of the selected object to extrapolate the projected object usage in the future.

To open Capacity Manager, in the PEM client, select **Management > Capacity Manager**. The Capacity Manager wizard opens, displaying a tree on the **Metrics** tab. On the **Metrics** tab, expand the tree to review the metrics for the node that you want to analyze. Select the metric to include it in your report.

Capacity Manager uses the aggregation method specified with the **Aggregation** list. Capacity Manager uses the aggregation method to evaluate and plot the metric values. Select from:

-   **Average** &mdash; Use the average of the values recorded during the time period.
-   **Maximum** &mdash; Use the maximum value recorded during the time period.
-   **Minimum** &mdash; Use the minimum value recorded during the time period.
-   **First** &mdash; Use the first value recorded during the time period.

To remove a metric from the Capacity Manager report, clear the box to the left of the name of a metric.

Move the slider next to **Graph/chart metrics individually?** to **Yes** to produce a separate report for each metric selected on the **Metrics** tab. If the option is set to **No**, all selected metrics are merged into a single graph or table.

Select **Generate** to display the report onscreen (accepting the default configuration options), or use the **Options** tab to customize sampling boundaries, report type, and report destination. The times displayed on the **Options** tab are from the time zone where the PEM client resides.

Use the fields in the **Time Period** box to define the boundaries of the Capacity Manager report:

-   Use the **Period** list to select the type of time period to use for the report. You can select:

| Start time and end time               | Specify a start date and an end date/time for the report                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Start time and threshold              | Specify a start date and time and a threshold to determine the end time and date for the report.                                                                                                             |
| Historical days and extrapolated days | Specify a start date for the report that is a number of days in the past and an end date that is a number of days in the future. This option is useful for report templates that don't specify fixed dates. |
| Historical days and threshold         | Specify a start date that is a number of days in the past, and end it when a threshold value is reached.                                                                                                      |

After specifying the type of time period for the report, select from other options in the **Time Period** box to define the time period for the report:

-   Use the date and time selectors next to the **Start time** field to specify the starting date and time of the sampling period. Or select the number of historical days of data to include in the report. The date and time specified in the **Start time** field can't be later than the current date/time.

    By default, Capacity Manager selects a start time one week prior to the current date and time.

-   The end boundary for the report can be a time, a number of days in the future, or the point at which a selected metric reaches a specified threshold value. Use the date and time selectors next to **End time** to specify an end boundary for the report. Or select the number of extrapolated days of data to include in the report. The time specified in the **End time** field must be later than the time specified in the **Start time** field.

    If you select an end date and time in the future, Capacity Manager uses historical usage information to extrapolate anticipated future usage. Since the projected usage is based on the sampling of historical data, the accuracy of the future usage trend improves with a longer sampling period.

    To specify a threshold value, use the list in the **Threshold** field to select a metric, an operator (**Exceeds** or **Falls below**), and a target value for the metric. If you choose to define the end of the report using a threshold, the Capacity Manager report terminates when the value for the selected metric exceeds or falls below the specified value.

The `cm_max_end_date_in_years` configuration parameter defines a default time value for the end boundary of a Capacity Manager report. If you specify a threshold value as the end boundary of a report and the anticipated usage of the boundary isn't met before the maximum time passes, the report terminates at the time specified by the `cm_max_date_in_years` parameter. By default, `cm_max_end_date_in_years` is 5. You can use the Server Configuration dialog box to modify the value of `cm_max_end_date_in_years`.

The fields in the **Report** box specify the report type and destination. Use the **Include on report** options to specify the type of report produced by Capacity Manager:

-   Select **Graph** to display the report in the form of a line graph in the PEM client window.
-   Select **Table of data** to display a table containing the report data in the PEM client window.
-   Select **Graph and table of data** to display both a line graph and a data table in the PEM client window.

Use the **Report destination** options to set where to display or save the report:

-   Select **New tab** to display the report on a new tab in the PEM client. You must select **New tab** to display the first generation of a Capacity Manager report. For subsequent reports, you can select **Previous tab**.
-   Select **Previous tab** to reuse a previously opened tab when displaying the report.
-   Select **Download the report as a file** and specify a file name to write the report to the specified file.

After you specify the report boundaries and select the type and destination of the Capacity Manager report, select **Generate** to create the report.

Reports saved to file are stored as HTML. You can review a Capacity Manager report with any web browser that supports scalable vector graphics (SVG). Browsers that don't support SVG can't display a Capacity Manager graph and might include unwanted characters.

## Capacity Manager templates

After defining a report, you can save the definition as a template for future reports. All PEM users can access Capacity Manager report templates. To save a report definition as a template:

1.  Use the **Metrics** and **Options** tabs to define your report.
1.  Select **Save**.
1.  In the **Save Template** dialog box, Provide a report name in the **Title** field and select a location to store the template in the tree.
1.  Select **OK**.

When creating a report, you can use **Load Template** to browse and open an existing template. Once opened, you can modify the report definition and save it again, either as a new template or by overwriting the original template.

Select **Manage Templates** to open a dialog box that lets rename or remove unwanted templates.
