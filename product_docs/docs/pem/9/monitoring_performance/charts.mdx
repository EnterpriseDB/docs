You can use the **Manage Charts** tab to create or modify a custom line chart or table or to import a Capacity Manager template to use in a custom chart. After defining a chart, you can display the chart on a custom dashboard. 

To open the **Manage Charts** tab, in the PEM client, select **Management > Manage Charts**. The **Manage Charts** tab provides a Quick Links menu for accessing dialog boxes to:

-   Create a new chart for use on a custom dashboard.
-   Import a Capacity Manager template to use as a template for creating a custom chart.
-   Access online help.

The Custom Charts table displays a list of charts you defined. When a chart is new, the font is green. When you add a chart or refresh the screen, the font is black. Use the search box in the upper-right of the Custom Charts table to search through your custom charts. Specify:

-   Chart name
-   Type
-   Level
-   Metrics category

Use icons to the left of a chart name in the Custom Charts table to manage a chart:

-   Select **Edit** to open the Chart Configuration wizard and modify aspects of the chart or table.
-   Select **Delete** to delete the selected chart.

### Creating a custom chart

Select **Create New Chart** in the Quick Links section of the **Manage Charts** tab to open the Create Chart wizard. The wizard takes you through the steps required to define a new chart. 

1.  Use the Configure Chart dialog box to specify general information about the chart:

    -   Specify the name of the chart in the **Name** field.
    -   Use the list in the **Category** field to specify the category in which to display this chart. When adding a custom chart to a custom dashboard, you can select the chart from the category specified.
    -   Use the **Type** field to specify if the chart is a line chart or a table.
    -   Provide a description of the chart in the **Description** field. The description is displayed on a custom dashboard when the user selects the information icon next to the chart.

    After you complete the fields on the Configure Chart dialog box, select **Next**.

1.  Use the Select Metrics dialog box to select the metrics to display on the chart.

    -   Use the **Metric level** list to specify the level of the PEM hierarchy from which you want to select metrics. You can specify **Agent**, **Database**, or **Server**. Each level offers access to a unique set of probes and metrics.

    -   Use the tree in the **Available metrics** box to select the metrics to display on the chart.

        If you're creating a table, you can select metrics from only one probe. Each node of the tree lists the metrics returned by a single probe. Expand a node of the tree and select the check box next to a metric name to include that metric data in the table.

        If you're creating a line chart, expand the nodes of the tree and double-click each metric that you want to include in the chart.

    -   Use the Selected Metrics panel to specify how the metric data appears in your chart. The selection panel displays the name of the metric in the nonmodifiable Metric \[Probe] column. You can:

        -   Select the trash can to delete a metric from the list of selected metrics.
        -   Use the lists in the Selection Criteria column to specify the order of the data displayed.
        -   Use the **Limit** field to specify the number of rows in a table or lines in a chart: up to 32 lines and 100 rows.

    -   If you're creating a line chart, PEM supports comparisons of cross-hierarchy metrics.

        -   Select **Compare** to select one or more probe-specific attributes (such as CPUs, interfaces, and databases) to compare in the chart.
        -   Select **Copy** to apply your selections to all of the metrics for the same probe.

    After you complete the fields on the Select Metrics dialog box, select **Next**.

1.  Use the Set Options dialog box to specify display options for your chart:

    -   Use the **Auto Refresh** field to specify the number of minutes between chart updates. Choose a value from 1 to 120. The default auto refresh rate is 2 minutes.

    -   Use fields under **Line chart options** to specify display preferences for a line chart:

        -   Use the **Points to plot** field to specify the maximum number of points to plot on the chart.
        -   Use the fields to the right of **Historical span** to specify how much historical data to display on the chart in days, hours, and minutes.

    -   Use the fields in the **Data extrapolation** box to specify whether PEM generates extrapolated data based on historical data:

        -   Select **No Extrapolation** to omit extrapolated data from the chart.
        -   Select **Span** to use the **Days** and **Hours** selectors to specify the period of time spanned by the metrics on the chart.
        -   Select **Threshold** to use threshold selectors to specify a maximum or minimum value for the chart.

    After you complete the fields in the Set Options dialog box, select **Next**.

1.  Use the Set Permissions dialog box to specify display options for your chart.

    -   Set the **Share with all** slider to **Yes** to make the chart available to all authorized users. Select **No** to restrict access to the users or groups specified in the **Access permissions** field.
    -   Use the **Access permissions** field to select the groups you want to give access to the chart to.

    After you finish defining the chart, select **Finish** to save your edits and add your chart to the list on the **Manage Charts** tab.

### Importing a Capacity Manager template

Select **Import Capacity Manager Template** in the Quick Links section of the **Manage Charts** tab to open the Create Chart dialog box and use a Capacity Manager template as a starting point for a chart or table.

1.  When the Create Chart dialog box opens, provide information about the custom chart:

    -   Use the **Import capacity template** list to select the name of the template on which the chart is based.
    -   Specify the name of the chart in the **Name** field.
    -   Use the **Category** list to specify the category in which to display this chart. When adding a custom chart to a custom dashboard, you can select the chart from this category.
    -   Use the **Type** field to specify if the chart is a line chart or a table.
    -   Provide a description of the chart in the **Description** field. The description is displayed on the custom dashboard when user selects the information icon next to the chart.

    Select **Next**.

1.  The Select Metrics window allows you to review the metrics specified by the selected template. The bottom panel of the chart editor displays the metrics to include in the chart. You can't modify the metrics included in the chart using the chart editor. To modify the metrics, use the Capacity Manager utility to update the template.

    After you review the metrics, select **Next**.

1.  Use the Set Options window to specify display options for your chart:

    -   Use the **Auto Refresh** field to specify the number of minutes between chart updates. Choose a value from 1 to 120. The default auto refresh rate is 2 minutes.

    -  Use the **Data extrapolation** box to specify the time period covered by the chart. You can either:

    -   Select **Historical days and extrapolated days** and provide:
        -   The number of days of historical data to chart in the **Historical** field.
        -   The number of projected days to chart in the **Extrapolated** field.
    -   Select **Historical days and threshold** and provide:
        -   The number of days of historical data to chart in the **Historical** field.
        -   The threshold value at which the chart ends.

    After you complete the Set Options window, select **Next**.

1.  Use the Set Permissions window to specify display options for your chart:

    -   Set the **Share with all slider** to **Yes** to make the chart available to all authorized users. Set it to **No** to restrict access to the users or groups specified in the **Access permissions** field.
    -   Use the **Access permissions** field to select the groups to give access to the chart to.

    After you finish defining the chart, select **Finish** to save your edits and add your chart to the list on the **Manage Charts** tab.
