The Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD) tool is a database design tool that provides a graphical representation of database tables, columns, and inter-relationships. ERD can give sufficient information for the database administrator to follow when developing and maintaining the database. To access the ERD tool, select **Tools > ERD Tool**. The ERD tool allows you to:

-   Design and visualize the database tables and their relationships.
-   Add notes to the diagram.
-   Align the tables and links for a cleaner look.
-   Save the diagram and open it later to continue working on it.
-   Generate ready-to-run SQL from the database design.
-   Generate the database diagram for an existing database.

- The remaining rows dispalys the table's column names and their data types. 
   - A column that is a primary key displays as a lock key, like `id integer` in the example. 
   - Other columns diplay as a green column, like `email character varying` in the example.
- Select the node to drag it on the canvas.
- To open the table dialog box and change the table details, either double-click the table node or select **Edit** on the toolbar. See Table dialog in the PEM client online help for information on different fields.

## One-to-many link dialog box

![ERD Tool - One-to-Many Dialog Box](images/erd_1m_dialog.png)

The one-to-many link dialog box allows you to:

-   Add a foregin key relationship between two tables.
-   Select a Local Table that references another table. The Local Table has the `many` end point.
-   Select a Local Column that references another column.

-   Select the Referenced Column. 

## Many-to-many link dialog box

The many-to-many link dialog box allows you to:

-   Add a many-to-many relationship between two tables.
-   Create a relation table with linked columns that are derived from the two tables.
-   Select the Left Table, which is the first table that is linked. The Left Table has the `one` endpoint of the link with the new relation table.
-   Select the Left table Column, which is the first table's column. The Left table Column is a primary key.
-   Select the Right Table, which is the second table that is linked. The Right Table has the `one` endpoint of the link with the new relation table.
-   Select the Right table Column, which is the second table's column. The Right table Column is a primary key.

## Table link

![ERD Tool - Table Link](images/erd_table_link.png)

The table link shows the relationship between tables:

-   The single-line endpoint of the link shows the column that is the reference.
-   The three-line endpoint of the link shows the column that references.
-   If one of the columns that is a reference or that references is removed from the table, then the link drops.
-   Select the link to drag it on the canvas.

## Table notes

To add a note to a table:

1. On the toolbar, select **Add/Edit note**.
1. In the window, enter your note.

When a note is added to a table, **Note** becomes enabled on the Table node. To check or update notes, select **Note**.
