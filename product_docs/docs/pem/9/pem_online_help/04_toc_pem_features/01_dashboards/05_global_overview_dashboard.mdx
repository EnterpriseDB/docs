Upon connecting to Postgres Enterprise Manager, the web interface displays the `Global Overview` dashboard. The Global Overview dashboard displays the status of each PEM server and agent, and calls your attention to any triggered alerts on monitored objects.

Use parameters on the [PEM Server Configurations](../02_pem_server_config/#pem_server_config) dialog to specify the auto-refresh rate for the dashboard. To access the `Server Configuration` dialog, select `Server Configuration...` from the PEM web interface `Management` menu.

The `Global Overview` header displays the date and time that the overview was last updated and the current number of triggered alerts.

The `Enterprise Dashboard` bar graph provides an at-a-glance overview of the status of your PEM agents and servers.

The `Agent Status` table provides detailed information about the status of each individual PEM agent:

-   Check the box in the `Blackout` column to disable alert processing for the agent and all servers monitored by the agent. This is useful when undertaking maintenance on the agent or the host on which the agent runs.
-   The `Status` column reports the current state of the agent; `UP`, `DOWN` or `UNKNOWN`. A healthy agent displays a green 'check' circle icon; an agent that is down displays a red 'info' circle icon; an agent registered with PEM, but - never sent an heartbeat, displays a gray 'question' circle icon. If user changes the colour for UP, DOWN or UNKNOWN status of agents in \**Enterprise Dashboard*\* bar chart, then that color will be reflected for the respective status icon.
-   The `Name` column displays the name of the agent. Click the name to navigate to the `Operating System Analysis` dashboard for the selected host.
-   The `Alerts` column displays the number of current alerts triggered on the server.
-   The `Version` column displays the agent's version.
-   The `Processes` column lists the number of processes running on the agent's host.
-   The `Threads` column lists the number of threads running on the agent's host.
-   The `CPU Utilisation (%)` column shows the average utilisation of all CPU cores on the host.
-   The `Memory Utilisation (%)` column shows the percentage of available RAM memory used on the host.
-   The `Swap Utilisation (%)` column shows the percentage of available swap memory used on the host.
-   The `Disk Utilisation` column shows the total percentage of disk space used, for all disks on the host.

The `Postgres Server Status` table provides detailed information about the status of each individual server:

-   Check the box in the `Blackout` column provides a checkbox to disable alert processing for the server. This is useful when performing maintenance on the server.
-   The `Status` column reports the current state of the server; UP, DOWN, UNKNOWN or UNMANAGED.
-   A healthy server displays a green 'check' circle icon; a disabled server displays a red 'info' circle icon; an unknown server displays a grey 'question' circle icon; an unmanged server displays a light gray 'user' circle icon. If user changes the colour for UP, DOWN, UNKNOWN or UNMANAGED servers in **Enterprise Dashboard** bar chart, then that color will be reflected for the respective status icon.
-   The `Name` column displays the name of the agent. Click the name to navigate to the `Operating System Analysis` dashboard for the host.
-   The `Connections` column reports the current number of connections to the server.
-   The `Alerts` column displays the number of current alerts triggered on the server.
-   The `Version` column lists the PostgreSQL version and build signature.
-   The `Remotely Monitored` column displays a `Yes` if the PEM agent that is bound to the monitored server does not reside on the same host as the server, and a `No` if the agent resides on the same host as the server.

Triggered alerts displayed in the `Alert Status` table include both PEM-defined alerts and user-defined alerts for all PEM-monitored hosts, servers, agents and database objects. The `Alert Status` table will also display an alert if an [agent or server is down](../../02_toc_pem_agent/03_pem_agent_start_pem_agent/#pem_agent_start_pem_agent).

-   The `Alarm Type` column reports the alert severity. An icon displays in red for a `High` severity alert, in yellow for a `Medium` severity alert, and in grey for a `Low` severity alert.
-   The `Object Description` column displays a description of the object that triggered the alert.
-   The `Alert Name` column displays the name of the triggered alert. When viewing the dashboard in the PEM client, you can click the Alert Name to open the configuration dialogue for the alert.
-   The `Value` column displays the current value of the object that triggered the alert.
-   The `Database` column displays the name of the database with which the alert is associated (if applicable).
-   The `Schema` column displays the name of the schema with which the alert is associated (if applicable).
-   The `Package` column displays the name of the package with which the alert is associated (if applicable).
-   The `Object` column displays the name of the object with which the alert is associated (if applicable).
-   The `Additional Params` column displays any additional parameters specified for the alert.
-   The `Additional Param Values` column displays any additional parameter values specified for the alert.
-   The `Alerting Since` column displays the date and time at which the alert triggered.
