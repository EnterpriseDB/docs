The Audit Log Dashboard allows you to browse the audit logs that have been collected from Advanced Server instances which have enabled audit logging and collection with the [Audit Manager](../04_audit_manager/#audit_manager). If the Audit Log Dashboard is opened from the Global level, it will display logs from all servers. If opened from the Agent level, it will show logs from all servers monitored by that Agent. If opened from the Server level, it will show logs from that server only.

The `Audit Log Dashboard` header includes the date and time that the page was last updated, and a current count of triggered alerts.

Audit Log table entries are loaded on demand in batches; to load additional entries, scroll to the end of the log and the additional rows will be automatically loaded from the database and added to the table. Log entries are show in chronological order, most recent first.
