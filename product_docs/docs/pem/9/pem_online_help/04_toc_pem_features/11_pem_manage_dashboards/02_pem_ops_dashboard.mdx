You can use the PEM [dashboard editor](01_pem_custom_dashboard/#pem_custom_dashboard) to create a custom dashboard formatted for display on an Ops monitor. An Ops dashboard displays the specified charts and graphs, while omitting header information and minimizing extra banners, titles, and borders.

To create an Ops dashboard, provide detailed information about the Ops display in the `Ops dashboard options` section of the `Create Dashboard` dialog:

-   Set the `Ops Dashboard?` field to `Yes` to instruct the server to create a dashboard that is formatted for display on an Ops monitor.
-   Set the `Show Title?` field to `Yes` to display the dashboard name at the top of the Ops dashboard.
-   Use the `Font` drop-down list box to select a custom font style for the title. The selected font style will be displayed in the `Preview` box.
-   Use the `Font size` drop-down list box to select a custom font size for the title. The selected font style will be displayed in the `Preview` box.

After adding charts and tables to the Ops dashboard, click the `Save` button to save your work. You can then access the dashboard by navigating through the `Dashboards` menu of the hierarchy level specified in the `Level` field on the `New Dashboard` dialog.
