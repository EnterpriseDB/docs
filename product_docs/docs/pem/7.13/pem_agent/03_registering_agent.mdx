<div id="registering_agent" class="registered_link"></div>


Each PEM agent must be *registered* with the PEM server. The registration process provides the PEM server with the information it needs to communicate with the agent. The PEM agent graphical installer for Windows supports self-registration for the agent. You must use the `pemworker` utility to register the agent if the agent is on a Linux host.

The RPM installer places the PEM agent in the `/usr/edb/pem/agent/bin` directory. To register an agent, include the `--register-agent` keywords along with registration details when invoking the pemworker utility:

> `pemworker --register-agent`

Append command line options to the command string when invoking the pemworker utility. Each option should be followed by a corresponding value:

| Option                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

If you want to use any PEM feature for which database server restart is required by the pemagent such as Audit Manager, Log Manager, or Tuning Wizard, then you must set the value for `allow_server_restart` as `true` in the `agent.cfg` file.

Note

</div>

When configuring a shell/batch script run by a PEM agent that has PEM 7.11 or later version installed, the user for the `batch_script_user` parameter must be specified. It is strongly recommended that a non-root user is used to run the scripts. Using the root user may result in compromising the data security and operating system security. However, if you want to restore the pemagent to its original settings using root user to run the scripts, then the `batch_script_user` parameter value must be set to `root`.

</div>

You can use the PEM\_SERVER\_PASSWORD environment variable to set the password of the PEM Admin User. If the PEM\_SERVER\_PASSWORD is not set, the server will use the PGPASSWORD or pgpass file when connecting to the PEM Database Server.

Failure to provide the password will result in a password authentication error; you will be prompted for any other required but omitted information. When the registration is complete, the server will confirm that the agent has been successfully registered.

## Setting PEM Agent Configuration Parameters

The PEM agent RPM installer creates a sample configuration file named `agent.cfg.sample` in the `/usr/edb/pem/agent/etc` directory. When you register the PEM agent, the pemworker program creates the actual agent configuration file (named `agent.cfg`). You must modify the agent.cfg file, adding the following configuration parameter:

> `heartbeat_connection = true`

You must also add the location of the `ca-bundle.crt` file (the certificate authority). By default, the installer creates a `ca-bundle.crt` file in the location specified in your `agent.cfg.sample` file. You can copy the default parameter value from the sample file, or, if you use a `ca-bundle.crt` file that is stored in a different location, specify that value in the `ca_file` parameter:

> `ca_file=/usr/libexec/libcurl-pem7/share/certs/ca-bundle.crt`

Then, use a platform-specific command to start the PEM agent service; the service is named `pemagent`. For example, on a CentOS or RHEL 6.x system, you would use the command:

> `/etc/init.d/pemagent`

On a CentOS or RHEL 7.x host, use systemctl to start the service:

> `systemctl start pemagent`

The service will confirm that it is starting the agent; when the agent is registered and started, it will be displayed on the `Global Overview` dashboard and in the Object browser tree control of the PEM web interface.

## Using a non-root User Account to Register a PEM Agent

To register a PEM agent using a non-root user, you first need to install PEM agent as a root user. After installation, assume the identity of a non-root user (for example edb) and perform the following steps:

1.  Create the `.pem` directory and `logs` directory as following and assign read, write, and execute permissions to the file:

<!-- -->

    mkdir /home/<edb>/.pem
    mkdir /home/<edb>/.pem/logs
    chmod 700 /home/<edb>/.pem
    chmod 700 /home/<edb>/.pem/logs

1.  Register the agent with PEM server using the `pemworker` utility as following:

<!-- -->

    ./pemworker --register-agent --pem-server <172.19.11.230> --pem-user <postgres> --pem-port <5432> --display-name <non_root> --cert-path /home/<edb> --config-dir /home/<edb>

The above command creates agent certificates and an agent configuration file (`agent.cfg`) in the `/home/edb/.pem` directory. Assign read and write permissions to these files using the command:

> `chmod -R 600 /home/edb/.pem/agent*`

1.  Change the parameters of the `agent.cfg` file as following:

<!-- -->

    agent_ssl_key=/home/edb/.pem/agent<id>.key
    agent_ssl_crt=/home/edb/.pem/agent<id>.crt
    log_location=/home/edb/.pem/worker.log
    agent_log_location=/home/edb/.pem/agent.log

1.  Update the value for path and user in the `pemagent` service file:

-   If you are using RHEL or CentOS 6, update the pemagent service file to reflect the correct path of `agent.cfg` file and also change user `su` to `su edb`.
-   If you are using RHEL or CentOS 7, update the parameters as following:

<!-- -->

    User=edb
    ExecStart=/usr/edb/pem/agent/bin/pemagent -c /home/edb/.pem/agent.cfg

1.  Kill the agent process that was started earlier, and then restart the agent service using the non-root user as follows:

-   If you are using RHEL or CentOS 6, `sudo /etc/init.d/pemagent start/stop/restart`
-   If you are using RHEL or CentOS 7, `sudo systemctl start/stop/restart pemagent`

1.  Check the agent status on PEM dashboard.
