title: "Using PEM to Manage EDB Postgres Ark"
---

PEM provides a user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your Ark consoles and create and scale Ark clusters. The PEM web interface helps you manage Ark by providing a point-and-click interface accessed in your favorite browser. Object definitions on existing Ark consoles (clusters, engines, server ../images, etc.) will be displayed in the PEM object browser when you register an Ark console with PEM.

Before you can use PEM's management features, you must register your Ark console with the PEM server.
