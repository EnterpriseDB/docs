The PEM web interface provides dialogs that allow you to review and modify the Ark console attributes.

The `Dashboard` tab displays icons that provide quick access to Ark information and features. If the tab is accessed from the top-level `Ark Servers` node, it includes informational links that are applicable to all consoles. If the tab is accessed from a console name node, the tab includes information specific to that console:

| Properties            | Select Properties to review the properties specified when registering an Ark console; if the server is disconnected, you may modify the property values. After modifying property values, select Save to preserve your changes.                                                    |

## Downloading Console Logs



Use options on the console `Dashboard` panel or context menu to download a zip file that contains the server logs for the underlying application server. You can use the log file to confirm changes to server status or verify server activity. To download a console log you can either:

-   Right click on the console name in the PEM Browser tree control and select `Download console logs` from the context menu.
-   Highlight a console name in the tree control and navigate to the `Dashboard` tab; then, select the `Download console logs` option from the `Quick Links` panel.

A popup will ask you to confirm your selection; click `OK` to download the log file.

You can also review the console logs via an ssh session. Log files are stored in `/var/log/edb-ark`; the current log file is `/var/log/edb-ark/ark.log`. Use the Linux tail utility to display the most recent entries in any of the server logs. For example, to review the last 10 lines in the server log file, use SSH to connect to the console host's backing database and enter:

> `tail file_name`

Where *file*\_*name* specifies the complete path to the log file. Include the -F option to instruct the tail utility to display only the last 10 lines of the log file, and new log file entries as they are added to the file:

> `tail -F file_name`

## Reviewing the Console Deployment Options



The `Installation options` dialog displays the deployment properties of the selected console. To open the dialog, right-click on a console name and select `Installation options` from the context menu.
