Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) consists of components that provide the management and analytical features of PEM:

-   **PEM Server:** The PEM server is used as the data repository for monitoring data and as a server to which both agents and clients connect. The PEM server consists of an instance of PostgreSQL and an associated database for storage of monitoring data, and a server that provides web services.

-   **PEM web interface:** The PEM web interface allows you to manage and monitor Postgres servers and utilize PEM extended functionality. The web interface software is installed with the PEM server installer, and is accessed via your choice of web browser.

-   **PEM Agent:** The PEM agent is responsible for executing tasks and reporting statistics from the agent host and monitored Postgres instances to the PEM server. A single PEM agent can monitor multiple installed instances of Postgres that reside on one or many hosts.

    The PEM Agent installer creates two executables: the PEM worker (`pemworker.exe`) and the PEM agent (`pemagent.exe`). Each PEM worker has a corresponding PEM agent that you can use to start or stop the PEM worker. The PEM agent will also restart the PEM worker should it terminate unexpectedly.

    The PEM worker log file contains information related to PEM worker activity (probe activities, heartbeat responses, etc.), and is stored in `/var/log/pem/worker.log`.

-   **SQL Profiler plugin:** This plugin to the Postgres server is used to generate the monitoring data used by the SQL Profiler tool. Installation of the SQL Profiler plugin is optional, but the plugin must be installed into each instance of Postgres you wish to profile. The SQL Profiler may be used with any supported version of an EnterpriseDB distribution of a PostgreSQL server or an Advanced Server (not just those managed through the PEM server). See [Installing the SQL Profiler Plugin](#installing_the_sql_profiler_plugin) section for details and supported versions.

The architectural diagram below illustrates the relationship between the various servers and workstations involved in a typical PEM installation.

Note

</div>

It is recommended that the operating system is kept up to date with the latest updates from the vendor on an ongoing basis. Failure to do so may result in compatibility or security issues.

</div>

The PEM server is supported on these platforms, using Advanced Server or PostgreSQL backing databases (version 9.4 and higher).

The PEM agent is supported on any Linux or Windows platform on which Advanced Server or PostgreSQL version 9.4 or higher is supported.

**Browser**

The PEM web interface is supported on the following browsers:

-   Google Chrome version 65 and above
-   Mozilla Firefox version 59 and above
-   Microsoft Edge version 42 and above
-   Apple Safari version 11.1 and above

**PostgreSQL Version Support**

PEM can manage and monitor:

-   PostgreSQL versions 9.4 and higher
-   Advanced Server 9.4 and higher

**SQL Profiler**

SQL Profiler for Postgres Enterprise Manager is supported on EDB Postgres Advanced Server 9.4 and later, and EnterpriseDB distributions of PostgreSQL version 9.4 and above.

## Hardware Prerequisites



For optimum speed when monitoring servers and rendering dashboards, we recommend installing PEM on a system with at least:

-   4 CPU cores
-   8 GB of RAM
-   100 GB of Storage

Additional disk space is required for data storage. Please note that resource usage will vary based on which probes are defined and enabled, and the activity level on the monitored databases. Monitoring server resources (as you use PEM) will let you know when you need to expand your initial system configuration.

## Software Prerequisites



**Modifying the pg\_hba.conf File**

The `pg_hba.conf` file manages connections for the Postgres server. You must ensure that the `pg_hba.conf` file on each monitored server allows connections from the PEM server, the monitoring PEM agent, and the host of the PEM-HTTPD server.

For information about modifying the `pg_hba.conf` file, see the *PEM Getting Started Guide* available at:

> <https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/product-documentation>

Information about managing authentication is also available in the Postgres core documentation available at:

> <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html>

**Firewall Restrictions**

Please note that you must adjust your firewall to allow communication between PEM components.

**PEM Agent Installation- Prerequisites for RHEL or CentOS 7.x**

Before installing the PEM agent on a CentOS 7.x host, you must ensure that the host contains the `wxBase` and `epel-release` packages. To install the packages, open a command line, assume `root` privileges, and invoke the commands:

> `yum install epel-release`  
> `yum install wxBase`

**Windows Permissions**

If you are installing PEM components on Windows, you may be required to invoke the PEM installers with `Administrative` privileges. To invoke an installer using Administrator privileges, right click on the installer icon and select `Run as Administrator` from the context menu.

**Supported Locales**

Currently, the PEM server and web interface support a locale of `English(US) en_US` and use of a period (.) as a language separator character. Using an alternate locale, or a separator character other than a period may result in errors.

**Windows Server IE Security**

If you are using Internet Explorer on a Windows Server host to access monitored servers with the PEM web interface, you must disable Internet Explorer's Enhanced Security to take advantage of PEM functionality. If you do not wish to disable IE Enhanced Security, we recommend that you use an alternate browser (such as Chrome).
