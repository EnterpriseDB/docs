The following features have been added to create Postgres Enterprise Manager 7.12:

-   Improved BART Integration- The following capabilities have been added to enhance the integration of BART with PEM:
    -   PEM 7.12 provides an option to create SSH certificates to allow passwordless authentication for backup and restore operations. You can enable passwordless SSH authentication from the database server's `Properties` dialog or from the `Backup Restore` dialog.
    -   You can now set or override the `archive_command` of the database server’s configuration by providing inputs in the database server’s `Properties` dialog.
-   Accessibility Improvements- Attributes have been added to provide an invisible label to the UI elements where a text label cannot be used.
-   Dark Theme (Beta)- You can now choose to use the dark theme while accessing the PEM console. In the following cases, the dark theme does not work in PEM console:
    -   Background of the pie charts under monitoring dashboards.
    -   All the reports generated for Capacity Manager, Log Analysis Expert, Postgres Expert, Tuning Wizard etc.
