title: "Managing a BART Server"
---





Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) is designed to assist database administrators, system architects, and performance analysts when administering, monitoring, and tuning PostgreSQL and Advanced Server database servers.

The EDB Backup and Recovery Tool (BART) is an administrative utility providing simplified backup and recovery management for multiple local or remote EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL database servers. For more information about BART, please visit the EnterpriseDB website at:

> <https://www.enterprisedb.com/enterprise-postgres/edb-postgres-backup-and-recovery-tool>

From PEM version 7.10 onwards, you can manage a BART server through PEM console. PEM provides a user-friendly interface that allows you to manage your BART server and perform all the BART operations from PEM console.

## Prerequisites

-   Before adding a BART server to the PEM console, you must manually install and configure BART on the BART host. For more information about installing and configuring BART, please see the *BART Installation Guide* available at:

    <https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs>

-   Before associating a database server with a BART server, you must authorize SSH/SCP access without a password prompt and enable WAL archiving for the managed database server. For more information about authorizing SSH/SCP access without a password prompt and enabling WAL archiving, please see *BART Installation Guide* available at:

    <https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs>

-   To take a backup of the standby database servers, you must ensure that the latest `pg_basebackup` utility is installed on the database server that you want to manage through BART.

-   To restore a BART backup, you must install the PEM agent as well as BART on the target server.

## Configuring a BART Server

You can use the `Create–BART server` dialog to register an existing BART server with the PEM server. To access the dialog, right-click on the `BART Servers` node and select `Create-BART Server`.

![*The Create-BART server dialog - General tab*](images/create_BART_server_general.png)

Use the fields on the `General` tab to describe the general properties of the BART Server:

-   Use the `Agent Name` field to select the agent that you want to configure as a BART server. Only those PEM agents that are supported for BART are listed in the drop-down list.

-   Use the `Server Name` field to specify a user-friendly name for the server. The name specified will identify the server in the Browser tree.

-   Use the `Host` field to specify the IP address of the host or agent where BART is installed.

-   Use the `User` field to specify the user name that will be used for performing all the BART operations. You can either use the `enterprisedb` (for Advanced Server) or `postgres` (for PostgreSQL) database user account or you can create a new BART user account. This user must be an operating system user who owns the BART backup catalog directory.

-   Use the `Installation path` field to specify the directory path where BART is installed on the host or BART server.

-   Use the `Backup path` field to specify the file system parent directory where all BART backups and archived WAL files will be stored.

-   Use the `pg_basebackup_path` field to specify the path to the `pg_basebackup` utility.

-   Use the `Xlog/WAL` method field to specify how the transaction log should be collected during the execution of pg\_basebackup. The default option is `fetch`; it specifies that the transaction log files will be collected after the backup has completed. Set the `Xlog` method to `stream` to stream the transaction log in parallel with the full base backup creation. If streaming is used, the `max_wal_senders` configuration parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file for affected database servers must account for an additional session for the streaming of the transaction log (the setting must be a minimum of 2).

    For more information about Xlog method, see:

    > <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgbasebackup.html>

-   Use the `Retention policy` field to specify the retention policy for the backup. This determines when an active backup should be marked as obsolete, and hence, be a candidate for deletion. You can specify the retention policy in terms of number of backup or in terms of duration (days, weeks, or months).

-   Use the `Log file` field to specify the path to BART log file. This is an optional field.

![*The Create-BART server dialog - Misc tab*](images/create_BART_server_misc.png)

Use the fields on the `Misc` tab to describe the backup-related properties of the BART Server:

-   Use the `Scanner log file` field to specify the path to the Xlog/WAL scanner log file. This is an optional field; BART does not create a WAL scanner log file if you do not specify the path.
-   Use the `WAL compression?` switch to specify if you want to compress the archived Xlog/WAL files in Gzip format. To enable WAL compression, the gzip compression program must be present in the BART user account’s PATH. The WAL compression setting must not be enabled for those database servers where you need to take incremental backups.
-   Use the `Copy WALs during restore?` field to specify how the archived WAL files are collected when invoking the RESTORE operation. Set to enabled to copy the archived WAL files from the BART backup catalog to the `restore_path/archived_wals` directory prior to the database server archive recovery. Set to `disabled` to retrieve the archived WAL files directly from the BART backup catalog during the database server archive recovery. Enabling this option helps you save time during the restore operation.
-   Use the `Thread count` field to specify the number of worker threads for copying blocks or data files from the database server to the BART backup catalog. Specify a `thread count` of `1` if you want to take the backup using the `pg_basebackup` utility.
-   Use the `Batch size` field to specify the number of blocks of memory used for copying modified blocks. This is applicable only for incremental backups.
-   Use the `scan interval` field to specify the number of seconds after which the WAL scanner should scan the new WAL files.
-   Use the `MBM scan timeout` field to specify the number of seconds to wait for MBM files before timing out. This is applicable only for incremental backups.

## Associating the BART Server with a Database Server

After configuring the BART server, you need to associate it with the database server whose backup you want to manage with BART. You can do one of the following:

-   Use the PEM console to modify the properties of an existing monitored database server to map it to the newly configured BART server.
-   Use the PEM console to create a new monitored database server, and map it to the newly configured BART server.

To map the BART server to a new PEM database server, right-click the `PEM Server Directory` node and select `Create` &gt; `Server`. Enter the details on all the generic tabs and then enter the BART-specific details on the `BART` tab.

![*The Create Server dialog (BART - General tab)*](images/create_server_bart_general.png)

Use the fields on the `General` tab to describe the general properties of the BART Server that will map to the PEM server:

-   Use the `BART server` field to select the BART server name. All the BART servers configured in the PEM console will be listed in this drop down list.
-   Use the `Server name` field to specify a name for the database server that you want to backup using the BART server. This name gets stored in the BART configuration file.
-   Use the `Description` field to specify the description of the database server.
-   Use the `Backup name` field to specify a template for user-defined names to be assigned to the backups of the database server. If you do not specify a backup name template, then the backup can only be referenced in BART sub-commands by the BART assigned, integer backup identifier.
-   Use the `Host address` field to specify the IP address of the database server that you want to configure for backup.
-   Use the `Port` field to specify the port to be used for the database that you want to backup.
-   Use the `User` field to specify the user of the database that you want to backup using BART through PEM console. If you want to enable incremental backups for this database server, then the user must be a superuser.
-   Use the `Password` field to specify the password for the user of the database that you want to backup.
-   Use the `Cluster Owner` field to specify the Linux operating system user account that owns the database cluster. This is typically `enterprisedb` for Advanced Server database clusters installed in the Oracle databases compatible mode, or `postgres` for PostgreSQL database clusters and for Advanced Server database clusters installed in the PostgreSQL databases compatible mode.
-   Use the `Archive command` field to specify the desired format of the archive command string to be used in bart.cfg file.
-   Use the `Allow incremental backup` field to specify if incremental backup should be enabled for this database server.

![*The Create - Server dialog (BART - Misc tab)*](images/create_server_bart_misc.png)

Use the fields on the `Misc` tab to describe the miscellaneous properties of the BART Server:

-   Use the `Override default configuration?` Switch to specify if you want to override the BART server configurations with the specific database server configurations.
-   Use the `Xlog` method to specify how the transaction log should be collected during the execution of `pg_basebackup`.
-   Use the `Retention policy` field to specify the retention policy for the backup. This determines when an active backup should be marked as obsolete, and hence, be a candidate for deletion. You can specify the retention policy in terms of number of backup or in terms of duration (days, weeks, or months).
-   Use the `WAL compression` switch to specify if you want to compress the archived Xlog/WAL files in Gzip format. To enable WAL compression, the gzip compression program must be present in the BART user account’s PATH. The wal\_compression setting must not be enabled for those database servers where you need to take incremental backups.
-   Use the `Copy WALs during restore` field to specify how the archived WAL files are collected when invoking the RESTORE operation. Set to enabled to copy the archived WAL files from the BART backup catalog to the &lt;restore\_path&gt;/archived\_wals directory prior to the database server archive recovery. Set to disabled to retrieve the archived WAL files directly from the BART backup catalog during the database server archive recovery.
-   Use the `Thread count` field to specify the number of threads to copy the blocks. You must set `thread count` to `1` if you want to take a backup with the `pg_basebackup` utility.
-   Use the `Batch size` field to specify the number of blocks of memory used for copying modified blocks, applicable only for incremental backups.
-   Use the `Scan interval` field to specify the number of seconds after which the WAL scanner should scan the new WAL files.
-   Use the `MBM scan timeout` field to specify the number of seconds to wait for MBM files before timing out, applicable only for incremental backups.

## Viewing the BART Server Details on a PEM Dashboard

Once the BART server is associated with the database server, you can see the entire backup and restore related details for that particular BART server on the PEM Dashboard. You can also perform operations such as restoration or deletion of a backup that is listed on the dashboard.

![*The BART Backup Dashboard*](images/bart_backup_dashboard.png)

When you select a monitored BART server, details of all the associated database servers along with their backups and restore activities are displayed as a chart on the Dashboard in the `Backup and Restore Activities` panel. You can filter the list of backups on any criteria that you specify in the filter boxes (the database server, activity, or duration).

The `Managed Database servers` panel displays a list of all the database servers managed by that particular BART server along with their high-level details.

The `Initiated Server Backups` panel displayes a list of all the backups of the database servers managed by that particular BART server. You can filter the list to display the details of a particular database server. You can also filter the list on any criteria that you specify in the filter box. Typically, this filter works with any kind of string value (excluding date, time, and size) listed under the columns. For example, you can type `tar` to filter the list and display only those backups that are in tar format.

Backup details displayed include the `Backup Name`, `Backup ID`, `Status`, `Server Name`, `Start Time`, `Type`, `Parent ID`, `Format`, `Duration`, and `Size`. The `Status` column shows the status of the backups which can be one of the following: `In Progress`, `Active`, `Keep`, or `Obsolete`.

The backups are marked as `Obsolete` after the backup retention period has passed or number of retained backups that you have specified as retention policy of the BART server is met. If you want to make an exception so that a particular backup does not get marked as `Obsolete` even after the expiry of the duration of retention policy, then you need to mark that particular backup as `Keep`. Similarly, if you mark a particular backup as `NoKeep`, the backup is re-evaluated to determine if its status should be changed back to obsolete based upon the current retention policy.

The red pin in the first column under `Actions` indicates that a backup is marked as `Keep` while a green one indicates that the backup is marked as `NoKeep`. The second column under `Actions` displays the `Restore` icon; you can perform the `Restore` operation by clicking on the icon.

You can delete all the `Obsolete` backups by clicking the `Delete Obsolete` button. You can also refresh the list of backups by clicking the `Refresh` button.

## Scheduling BART Backups

To schedule a backup using BART, select `Schedule Backup` under `Tools` menu. You can see a list of scheduled backups with details such as `Logs`, `Last result`, `Database server`, `Last backup name`, `Started on`, `Type`, `Parent`, `Format`, `Verify checksum?`, and `Use pg_basebackup?`. Click the Add icon (+) to add a schedule for the backup. Enter the details in the schedule definition dialog:

![*The Schedule Backup dialog - General options*](images/BART_backup_scheduler_general.png)

Use the fields on the `General` tab to describe the general properties of the backup:

-   Use the `Database Server` field to specify the target database server that you want to back up.

-   Use the `Backup type` switch to specify the backup type I. e. full backup or incremental backup.
-   Use the `Parent backup` field to select the ID of the parent backup for incremental backup. This parent backup can either be a full or an incremental backup.
-   Use the `Format switch` to specify the output format of the backup i.e plain text or tar. For incremental backup, you need to select plain text only.
-   Use the `Gzip compression` switch to specify if gzip compression should be enabled for the backup. This option is applicable only for the tar format.
-   Use the `Compression level` field to specify the gzip compression level on the tar file output.
-   Use the `Thread count` field to specify the number of threads that will copy the blocks.
-   Use the `MBM scan timeout` field to specify the number of seconds to wait for required MBM files before timing out.
-   Use the `Verify checksum` field to specify if you want the application to verify the checksum of the backup.
-   Use the `pg_basebackup` field to specify if the pg\_basebackup utility should be used for the backup. Typically, pg\_basebackup utility is used only for backing up the standby servers since it cannot be used for incremental backups.

![*The Schedule Backup dialog - (Schedule : General)*](images/BART_backup_scheduler_schedule_general.png)

Provide information on the `Schedule` tab to describe the scheduling details:

-   Use the `Enabled?` switch to indicate if the schedule should be enabled (`Yes`) or disabled (`No`).
