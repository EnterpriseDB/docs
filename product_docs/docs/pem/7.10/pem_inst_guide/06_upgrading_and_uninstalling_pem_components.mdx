title: "Upgrading and Uninstalling PEM Components"
---

For detailed information about upgrading and moving PEM components, please see the *PEM Upgrade and Migration Guide*. PEM documentation and links to PEM and SQL Profiler installers are available from the [EnterpriseDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/product-documentation)

**Upgrading Postgres Enterprise Manager on Windows**

To upgrade your version of PEM on Windows, simply invoke the PEM component installers. Each installer will notify you if it detects a previous installation, and will upgrade to the more recent version of PEM.

You should invoke the PEM installers in the following order:

1.  Invoke the PEM agent installer on each monitored node *except* the PEM server node.
2.  Invoke the PEM server installer; this installer will upgrade *both* the PEM server and the PEM agent that resides on the PEM server node.

For detailed information about upgrading from a previous version, see the *PEM Upgrade and Migration Guide*.

**Upgrading SQL Profiler on a Linux Host**

To upgrade a SQL Profiler installation that resides on a Linux host:

1.  Delete the existing SQL Profiler query set on each node by invoking the `uninstall-sql-profiler.sql` script.

> -   By default, if you are using Advanced Server on a Linux host, the script resides in:
>
>     `/opt/PostgresPlus/x.x/share/contrib`
>
> -   If you are using a PostgreSQL installation on a Linux host, the script resides in:
>
>     `/opt/PostgreSQL/x.x/share/postgresql/contrib`
>
>     Where *x.x* specifies the installed Postgres version.

1.  Then, invoke the new SQL Profiler installer on each node you wish to profile.

**Upgrading SQL Profiler on a Windows Host**

If you are using SQL Profiler on a Windows host, Windows will lock any files that have been executed or loaded into memory. To release any locked files, you must stop the Postgres server before performing an upgrade.

After stopping the Postgres Server:

1.  Delete the existing SQL Profiler query set on each node by invoking the `uninstall-sql-profiler.sql` script.

> -   If you are using Advanced Server on a Windows host, the script resides in:
>
>     `C:\Program Files\PostgresPlus\x.x\share\contrib`
>
> -   If you are using a PostgreSQL installation on a Windows host, the script resides in:
>
>     `C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\x.x\share\contrib`
>
>     Where *x* specifies the installed Postgres version.

1.  Invoke the new SQL Profiler installer on each node you wish to profile.

    Then, restart the Postgres Server, to resume profiling the node.

**Troubleshooting**

Upgrading SQL Profiler on a Windows Host

After upgrading to a newer version of SQL Profiler, if you encounter the following error:

```
An error has occurred:
ERROR: function return row and query-specified return row do not
  match
DETAIL: Returned row contains 11 attributes, but query expects 10.
```

To correct this error, you must replace the existing query set with a new query set. First, uninstall SQL Profiler by invoking the `uninstall-sql-profiler.sql` script, and then reinstall SQL Profiler by invoking the `sql-profiler.sql` script.

**Uninstalling Postgres Enterprise Manager**

The process of uninstalling the PEM server or agent is platform-specific. The name of the package for PEM server is `edb-pem` and for PEM agent is `edb-pem-agent`.

If you uninstall the PEM server package from a host, the PEM agent package installed on the same host doesn't get uninstalled. But if you uninstall the PEM agent package, then the PEM server package installed on the same host also gets uninstalled.

**Uninstalling PEM from Windows hosts**

If the PEM installation resides on a Windows host, you can use the Windows `Add/Remove Programs` application to remove PEM components. Select the `Add/Remove Programs` option from the Windows `Control Panel`. When the `control panel` opens, locate the name of the PEM component in the program list. Click the `Remove` button to remove the component.

You can also invoke the uninstaller that resides at the following location:

> `C:\\Program Files\edb\pem\server`

**Uninstalling PEM from CentOS or RHEL hosts**

You can use variations of the `rpm`, `yum remove`, or `yum erase` commands to remove the installed packages. Note that removing a package does not damage the PEM data directory.

-   Include the `-e` option when invoking the rpm command to remove an installed package; the command syntax is:

    `rpm -e <package_name>`

-   You can use the `yum remove` command to remove the pem server or agent package installed by yum. To remove a package, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter the command:

    `yum remove <package_name>`

-   You can use the `yum erase` command to remove the pem server or agent package along with the `edb-pem` and `edb-pem-docs` dependencies. To remove a package, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter the command:

    `yum erase <package_name>`

Where *package_name* is the name of the package that you would like to remove.

**Uninstalling PEM from Debian or Ubuntu hosts**

You can use `apt-get remove` or `apt-get purge` command to uninstall the PEM server or agent package from a Debian or Ubuntu host:

-   To uninstall PEM server or agent from a Debian or Ubuntu host without impacting the configuration files and data directories, invoke the following command:

    `apt-get remove <package_name>`

-   To uninstall PEM server or agent along with the configuration files and data directory, invoke the following command:

    `apt-get purge <package_name>`

Where *package_name* is the name of the package that you would like to remove.

**Uninstalling PEM from SLES hosts**

To uninstall PEM server or agent from a SLES host, invoke the following command:

`zypper remove <package_name>`

Where *package_name* is the name of the package that you would like to remove.
