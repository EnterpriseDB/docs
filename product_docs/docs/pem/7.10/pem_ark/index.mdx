title: "PEM ARK Management"
---

Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) is designed to assist database administrators, system architects, and performance analysts when administering, monitoring, and tuning PostgreSQL and Advanced Server database servers. PEM has been designed to manage and monitor a single server or multiple servers from a single console, allowing complete control over monitored databases.

EDB Ark provisions EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL databases in single instances, high-availability clusters, or application development sandboxes on Amazon AWS, Azure, and OpenStack hosts. EDB Ark offers an elastic and highly scalable environment that frees DBAs and application developers from the rigors of setting up and administering modern and robust database environments.

Throughout this guide, the term `Postgres` refers to either a PostgreSQL or an Advanced Server installation, where either is appropriate.
