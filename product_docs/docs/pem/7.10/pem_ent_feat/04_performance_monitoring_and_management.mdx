title: "Performance Monitoring and Management"
---





PEM contains built-in functionality that implements enterprise-wide performance monitoring of all managed servers. While you can customize many aspects of the various performance monitoring aspects of PEM, you can also elect to accept the recommended defaults that come out-of-the-box with the product.

![*The Global Overview dashboard*](images/global_overview_dashboard.png)

The top-level dashboard is the `Global Overview`. The Global Overview presents a status summary of all the servers and agents that are being monitored by the PEM server, a list of the monitored servers, and the state of any currently triggered alerts.

## Using Dashboards to View Performance Information



PEM displays performance statistics through a number of dashboards; each dashboard contains a series of summary views that contain charts, graphs and tables that display the statistics related to the selected object.

The PEM client displays the Global Overview dashboard when it connects to the PEM server. Additional dashboards provide statistical information about monitored objects. These include the:

**Alerts Dashboard**

> The Alerts dashboard displays the currently triggered alerts. If opened from the Global Overview, the dashboard displays the current alerts for all monitored nodes on the system; if opened from a node within a server, the report will reflect alerts related to that node, and all monitored objects that reside below that object in the tree control.

**Audit Log Analysis dashboard**

> For Advanced Server users, the Audit Log Analysis dashboard allows you to browse the audit logs that have been collected from instances that have audit logging and collection enabled.

**Database Analysis dashboard**

> The Database Analysis dashboard displays performance statistics for the selected database.

**I/O Analysis dashboard**

> The I/O Analysis dashboard displays I/O activity across various areas such as object DML activity, log operations and more.

**Memory Analysis dashboard**

> The Memory Analysis dashboard supplies statistics concerning various memory-related metrics for the Postgres server.

**Object Activity Analysis dashboard**

> The Object Activity Analysis dashboard provides performance details on tables/indexes of a selected database.

**Operating System Analysis dashboard**

> The Operating System Analysis dashboard supplies information regarding the performance of the underlying machineâ€™s operating system.

**Probe Log Analysis Dashboard**

> The Probe Log Analysis dashboard displays any error messages returned by a PEM agent.

**Server Analysis dashboard**

> The Server Analysis dashboard provides general performance information about the overall operations of a selected Postgres server.

**Server Log Analysis dashboard**

> The Server Log Analysis dashboard allows you to filter and review the contents of server logs that are stored on the PEM server.

**Session Activity Analysis dashboard**

> The Session Activity Analysis dashboard provides information about the session workload and lock activity for the selected server

**Session Waits Analysis dashboard**

> The Session Waits Analysis dashboard provides an overview of the current DRITA wait events for an Advanced Server session.

**Storage Analysis dashboard**

> The Storage Analysis dashboard displays space-related metrics for tablespaces and objects.

**System Waits Analysis dashboard**

> The System Waits Analysis dashboard displays a graphical analysis of system wait information for an Advanced Server session.

**Streaming Replication Analysis dashboard**

> The Streaming Replication Analysis dashboard displays statistical information about WAL activity for a monitored server and allows you to monitor the status of Failover Manager clusters.

There are two ways to open a dashboard; you can:

-   Select an active dashboard name from the Dashboards menu (accessed via the Management menu).
-   Right click on the name of a monitored object in the tree control and select the name of the dashboard you would like to review from the Dashboards menu.

Each dashboard is displayed on the `Monitoring` tab in the main panel of the client window. After opening a dashboard, you can navigate to other dashboards within the same tab.

Each dashboard header includes navigation menus that allow you to navigate to other dashboards; use your browsers forward and back icons to scroll through previously-viewed dashboards. Use the Refresh icon to update the current dashboard.

Options on the `Dashboard Configuration` dialog allow you to link the time lines of all of the line graphs on the dashboard. To open the `Dashboard Configuration` dialog, click the Settings icon displayed in the dashboard header.

![*The Dashboard Configuration dialog*](images/dashboard_configuration.png)

Use fields on the `Dashboard Configuration` dialog to control attributes of the charts displayed on the dashboard:

-   Set the Link timelines of all the line charts slider to Enable to indicate that the specified timeline should be applied to line graphs displayed on the dashboard; if set to Disable, your preferences will be preserved for later use, but will not modify the amount of data displayed.
-   Use the `Days` selector to specify the number of days of gathered data that should be displayed on line graphs.
-   Use the `Hour(s)` selector to specify the number of hours of gathered data that should be displayed on line graphs.
-   Check the box next to Remember configuration for this dashboard to indicate that the customized time span should be applied to the current dashboard only; if left unchecked, the time span will be applied globally to line graphs on all dashboards.

Please note that settings specified on the Dashboard Configuration dialog are applied only to the current user's session.

## Managing Custom Dashboards



PEM displays performance statistics through a number of system-defined dashboards; each dashboard contains a series of summary views that contain charts, graphs and tables that display statistics related to the selected object. You can use the `Manage Dashboards` tab to create and manage custom dashboards that display the information that is most relevant to your system.

When you've finished defining the chart, click `Finish` to save your edits and add your chart to the list on the `Manage Charts` tab.

## Customizing Probes



A probe is a scheduled task that returns a set of performance metrics about a specific monitored object. A probe retrieves statistics from a monitored server, database, operating system or agent. You can use the Manage Probes tab (shown in Figure 6.13) to override the default configuration and customize the behavior of each probe.

To open the `Manage Probes` tab, select `Manage Probes...` from the `Management` menu. The Manage Probes tab opens in the PEM client.

![*The Manage Probes tab*](images/manage_probes_tab.png)

The `Manage Probes` tab provides a set of Quick Links that you can use to create and manage probes:

-   Click the `Manage Custom Probes` icon to open the `Custom Probes` tab and create or modify a custom probe.
-   Click the `Copy Probes` icon to open the Copy Probe dialog, and copy the probe configurations from the currently selected object to one or more monitored objects.

A probe monitors a unique set of metrics for each specific object type (server, database, database object, or agent); select the name of an object in the tree control to review the probes for that object.

To modify the properties associated with a probe, highlight the name of a probe, and customize the settings that are displayed in the Probes table:

-   Move the`` `Default `` switch in the `Execution Frequency` columns to N to enable the Minutes and Seconds selectors, and specify a non-default value for the length of time between executions of the probe.
-   Move the `Default` switch in the `Enabled?` column to No to change the state of the probe, and indicate if the probe is active or not active.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

If data from a Disabled probe is used in a chart, the chart will display an information icon in the upper-left corner that allows you to enable the probe by clicking the provided link.

</div>

-   Move the `Default` switch in the `Data Retention` column to No to enable the Day(s) field and specify the number of days that information gathered by the probe is stored on the PEM server.

The `Manage Probes` tab may display information about probes that cannot be modified from the current node. If a probe cannot be modified from the current dialog, the switches are disabled. Generally, a disabled probe can be modified from a node that is higher in the hierarchy of the PEM client tree control; select another object in the tree control to modify which probes are displayed or enabled in the `Manage Probes` tab.

### Creating a Custom Probe



You can use the `PEM Custom Probes` tab to create a new probe or modify an existing user-defined probe. To open the `Custom Probes` tab, select the `Manage Custom Probes...` icon from the `Manage Probes` tab.

![*The Custom Probes dialog*](images/custom_probes_dialog.png)

Use the `Show System Probes?` switch to display or conceal the system probes on the Custom Probes tab.

You can use the `Custom Probes` tab to create a new probe or modify an existing probe. To create a new probe, click the Add icon in the upper-right corner of the tab; provide a name for the new probe in the Probe Name column. Then, select the Edit icon (located to the left of the probe name) to review or add the probe definition.

![*Defining a custom probe â€“ the General tab*](images/custom_probe_general.png)

Use the fields on the `General` tab to modify the definition of an existing probe or to specify the properties of a new probe:

-   Use the `Probe Name` field to provide a name for a new probe.

-   Use the `Collection method` field to specify the probe type. Use the drop-down listbox to select:

-   SQL - the probe will gather information via a SQL statement.

-   WMI - the probe will gather information via a Windows Management Instrumentation extension.

-   Batch - the probe will use a command-script or shell-script to gather information.

    Before creating a batch probe on a Linux system, you must modify the agent.cfg file, setting the allow\_batch\_probes parameter equal to true and restart the PEM agent. The `agent.cfg` file is located in `/opt/PEM/agent/etc`.

    On 64-bit Windows systems, agent settings are stored in the registry. Before creating a batch probe, modify the registry entry for the `AllowBatchProbes` registry entry and restart the PEM agent. PEM registry entries are located in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Wow6432Node\EnterpriseDB\PEM\agent`.

    Please note that batch probes are platform-specific. If you specify a collection method of Batch, you must specify a platform type in the Platform field.

-   Use the `Target Type` drop-down listbox to select the object type that the probe will monitor. Target type is disabled if Collection method is WMI.

-   Use the `Minutes` and `Seconds` selectors to specify how often the probe will collect data.

-   Use the `Probe Enable?` switch to specify if the probe in enabled by default. Specify Yes to enable the probe by default, or No to specify that the probe is disabled by default.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

If data from a disabled probe is used in a chart, the chart will display an information icon in the upper-left corner that allows you to enable the probe by clicking the provided link.

</div>

-   Use the `Data Retention` field to specify the number of days that gathered information will be retained in the probe's history table.
-   Use the switch next to `Discard from history` to specify if the server should create a history table for the probe. Select Yes to discard probe history, or No to retain the probe history in a table.
-   Use the `Platform` drop-down listbox to specify the type of platform that the probe will monitor. This field is enabled only when the Collection method is Batch.

![*The Columns tab of the Custom Probes dialog*](images/custom_probe_columns.png)

Use the `Columns` tab to define the columns in which the probe data will be stored. Navigate to the `Columns` tab, and click the Add button (in the upper-right corner) to define a new column. After a providing a column name in the Name field, click the Edit button (to the left of the new column name) to provide information about the column:

-   Provide a descriptive name for the column in the `Name` field.

-   The `Internal Name` field is not enabled for user-defined probes.

-   Use the `Column Type` drop-down listbox to specify if the column is a Key column (a primary key) or a Non key column. Non-key columns are generally metric items (values that can be graphed).

-   Use the `Data Type` drop-down listbox to specify the type of data that will be stored in the column.

-   Use the `Unit` field to specify the unit of measure that applies to the metric stored in the column. This unit is displayed on the Y-Axis of a custom chart or a Capacity Manager chart. This is an optional field.

-   Use the `Graphable` switch to specify if the defined metric may be graphed, and that the probe should be accessible from the Capacity Manager or Manage Charts dialogs.

-   Use the `Is PIT` switch to specify if the metric should be stored by point-in-time.

    'Point-in-time' metrics are those metrics that change (increase or decrease) at any given point of time. For example, database size is a point-in-time metric; at any given point-in-time, the size of the database is fluctuating. Metrics that are not point-in-time (also referred to as cumulative metrics) are metrics whose size always increases over time. For example, Blocks Read and Tuples Read are cumulative metrics; the value stays the same or increases.

-   Use the `Calculate PIT` switch to specify that the server should calculate a point-in-time value for the metric data. Calculate PIT is disabled if Is PIT is Yes.

    PEM allows you to store point-in time-values of cumulative metrics as well. PEM subtracts the last collected value of a cumulative metric from the current value, and stores the difference as a point-in-time value.

![*The Code tab of the Custom Probes dialog*](images/custom_probe_code.png)

Use the `Code` tab to specify the default code that will be executed by the probe:

-   If the probe is a SQL probe, you must specify the `SQL SELECT` statement invoked by the probe on the `Code` tab. The column names returned by the query must match the Internal Name specified on the `Columns` tab. The number of columns returned by the query, as well as the column name, data type, etc. must match the information specified on the `Columns` tab.

-   If the probe is a batch probe, you must specify the shell or .bat script that will be invoked when the probe runs. The output of the script should be as follows:

    The first line must contain the names of the columns provided on the `Columns` tab. Each column name should be separated by a tab (t) character. From the second line onwards, each line should contain the data for each column, separated by a tab character.

    If a specified column is defined as key column, you should ensure that the script does not produce duplicate data for that column across lines of output. The number of columns specified in the `Columns` tab and their names, data type, etc. should match with the output of the script output.

-   If the probe is a WMI probe, you must specify the WMI query as a `SELECT WMI` query. The column name referenced in the `SELECT` statement should be same as the name of the corresponding column specified on the `Column` tab. The column names returned by the query must match the `Internal Name` specified on the `Column` tab. The number of columns returned by the query, as well as the column name, data type, etc. must match the information specified on the Columns tab.

![*The Alternate Code tab of the Custom Probes dialog*](images/custom_probe_altenate_code.png)

Use the `Alternate Code` tab to provide code that will be invoked if the probe fires on a specific version of the server. To provide version-specific code, move the `Applies to any server version?` switch to `No`, and click the `Add` button. Then, use the `Database Version(s)` drop-down listbox to select a version, and click the `Edit` button (to the left of the version name) to provide the code that will execute when the probe fires.

If you select a database version, and leave the `Probe Code` column blank, PEM will invoke the code specified on the `Code` tab when the probe executes on a server that matches that version.

When you've finished defining the probe, click the `Save` icon (in the corner of the `Custom Probes` tab) to save the definition, and make the probe data available for use on custom charts and graphs.

### Deleting a Probe



Use the Delete icon (located to the left of a Probe Name) to delete a user-defined probe. When you delete a probe, the probe is marked for deletion and will be deleted later (when custom probes are purged). During the deletion, the probe definition is deleted and any corresponding tables are dropped from the pemdata and pemhistory schemas.

System probes are the built-in probes provided by PEM, and are part of the PEM schema. If you attempt to delete a system probe, the PEM client will display a notice, informing you that the probe cannot be deleted.

![*Attempting to delete a system probe*](images/delete_system_probe.png)

### Copying a Probe



You can use the `Copy Probe Configuration...` dialog to copy probe definitions from one monitored object to one or more monitored objects of the same type. To open the `Copy Probe Configuration...` dialog, highlight the object from which you are copying probes in the PEM client tree control, and select `Manage Probes` from the `Management` menu. When the `Manage Probes` tab opens, click on `Copy Probe` to open the `Copy Probe Configuration` dialog:

![*The Copy Probe Configuration tree control*](images/copy_probe_configuration.png)

The dialog will copy the probe definitions from the object through which the Copy Probe Configuration dialog was opened, to the location(s) selected on the tree control.

Note that if you specify a parent node in the Copy Probe Configuration tree control, PEM will copy the probe configurations to each object (of the same type) that resides under that node in the tree control. For example, to copy the probe definitions from one schema to all schemas that reside within a database, select only the parent database of the target schemas. Please note that a red warning symbol is displayed to the left of the name of a listed target object if that object is the source of the probe that is being copied.

When you have selected the target object or objects, click the `Configure Probes` button to copy the probe definitions to the location selected on the dialog.

## Alerting



PEM continually monitors registered servers and compares performance metrics against pre-defined and user-specified thresholds that constitute good or acceptable performance for each statistic. Any deviation from an acceptable threshold value triggers an alert. An alert is a system-defined or user-defined set of conditions that PEM compares to the system statistics. Alerts call your attention to conditions on registered servers that require your attention.

**Reviewing alerts on the Global Overview**

When your system statistics deviate from the boundaries specified for that statistic, the alert triggers, displaying a high (red), low (yellow), or medium (orange) severity warning in the left-most column of the `Alert Status` table on the `Global Overview` dashboard.

![*The Alert Status table*](images/alert_status.png)

The PEM server includes a number of pre-defined alerts that are actively monitoring your servers. If the alert definition makes details available about the cause of the alert, you can click the down arrow to the right of the severity warning to access a dialog with detailed information about the condition that triggered the alert.

![*Alert details*](images/alert_details.png)

PEM also provides an interface that allows you to create customized alerts. Each alert uses metrics defined on an alert template. An alert template defines how the server will evaluate the statistics for a resource or metric. The PEM server includes a number of pre-defined alert templates, or you can create custom alert templates.

### Using the Alerts Dashboard



Use the `Dashboards` menu (on the `Monitoring` tab) to access the `Alerts` Dashboard. The `Alerts` Dashboard displays a summary of the active alerts and the status of each alert:

![*The Alerts Dashboard*](images/alerts_dashboard.png)

The `Alerts Dashboard` header displays the date and time that the dashboard was last updated, and the number of current alerts.

The `Alerts Overview` section displays a graphic representation of the active alerts, as well as a count of the current high, low and medium alerts. The vertical bar on the left of the graph provides the count of the alerts displayed in each column. Hover over a bar to display the alert count for the selected alert severity in the upper-right hand corner of the graph.

The `Alert Details` table provides a list of the alerts that are currently triggered. The entries are prioritized from high-severity to lower-severity; each entry includes information that will allow you to identify the alert and recognize the condition that triggered the alert. Click the name of an alert to review detailed information about the alert definition.

The `Alert Errors` table displays configuration-related errors (eg. accidentally disabling a required probe, or improperly configuring an alert parameter). You can use the information provided in the Error Message column to identify and resolve the conflict that is causing the error.

**Customizing the Alerts Dashboard**

You can customize tables and charts that appear on the Alerts dashboard. To customize a table or chart, click the Settings icon located in the upper-right corner.

![*Customizing a chart*](images/customizing_chart.png)

Use fields on the Personalize chart configuration dialog (Figure 4.32) to provide your display preferences:

-   Use the `Auto Refresh` field to specify the number of seconds between updates of the data displayed in the table or chart.
-   If applicable, use the `Download as` field to indicate if you would like a chart to be downloaded as a JPEG image or a PNG image.
-   If applicable, use the `Colours selectors` to specify the display colors that will be used on a chart.
-   If applicable, set the `Show Acknowledged Alerts` switch to Yes indicate that you would like the table to display alerts that you have acknowledged with a checkbox in the Ack'ed column. Set the field to No to indicate that the table should hide any acknowledged alerts. The switch acts as a toggle; acknowledged alerts are not purged from the table content until the time specified in the alert definition passes.

To save your customizations, click the `Save` icon (a check mark) in the upper-right corner; to delete any previous changes and revert to the default values, click the `Delete` icon. The `Save` and `Delete` drop-down menus allow you to specify if your preferences should be applied to `All Dashboards`, or to a selected server or database.

### Using the Manage Alerts Tab



Use the PEM Client's `Manage Alerts` tab to define, copy, or manage alerts. To open the `Manage Alerts` tab, select `Manage Alerts` from the `Management` menu.

![*The Manage Alerts tab*](images/manage_alerts_dashboard.png)

Use the `Quick Links` toolbar to open dialogs and tabs that will assist you when managing alerts:

-   Click `Copy Alerts` to open the `Copy Alert Configuration` dialog and copy an alert definition.
-   Click `Alert Templates` to open the `Alert Template` tab, and modify or create an alert template.
-   Click `Email Groups` to open the `Email Groups` tab, and modify or create an email group.
-   Click `Server Configurations` to open the `Server Configuration` dialog and review or modify server configuration settings.
-   Click `Help` to open the PEM online help in a new tab of the PEM web interface.

Use the table in the `Alerts` section of the `Manage Alerts` tab to create new alerts or manage existing alerts.

#### Creating a Custom Alert Template

An alert template is a prototype that defines the properties of an alert. An alert instructs the server to compare the current state of the monitored object to a threshold (specified in the alert template) to determine if a situation exists that requires administrative attention.

You can use the `Alert Templates` tab to define a custom alert template or view the definitions of existing alert templates. To open the `Alert Templates` tab, select the `Manage Alerts...` menu option from the `Management` menu. When the Manage Alerts tab opens, select Alert Templates from the Quick Links toolbar.

![*The Alert Templates tab*](images/alert_templates_tab.png)

Use the `Show System Template` drop-down listbox to filter the alert templates that are displayed in the Alert Templates table. Use the listbox to select a level of the PEM hierarchy to view all of the templates for the selected level.

**Defining a New Alert Template**

To define a new alert template, use the `Show System Template` drop-down listbox to select None, and click the Add icon (+) located in the upper-right corner of the alert template table. The alert template editor opens.

![*The General tab*](images/alert_template_general.png)

Use fields on the `General` tab to specify general information about the template:

-   Use the `Template name` field to specify a name for the new alert template.

-   Use the `Description` field to provide a description of the alert template.

-   Use the `Target type` drop-down listbox to select the type of object that will be the focus of the alert.

-   Use the `Applies to server` drop-down listbox to specify the server type (EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL) to which the alert will be applied; you can specify a single server type, or ALL.

-   Use the `History retention` field to specify the number of days that the result of the alert execution will be stored on the PEM server.

-   Use the `Threshold unit` field to specify the unit type of the threshold value.

-   Use fields in the `Auto create` box to indicate if PEM should use the template to generate an automatic alert. If enabled, PEM will automatically create an alert when a new server or agent (as specified by the Target type drop-down listbox) is added, and delete that alert when the target object is dropped.

    -   Move the `Auto create?` slider to `Yes` to indicate that PEM should automatically create alerts based on the template. If you modify an existing alert template, changing the Auto create? slider from No to Yes, PEM will create alerts on the existing agents and servers. Please note that if you change the slider from Yes to No, the default threshold values in existing alerts will be erased, and cannot be recovered.
    -   Use the `Operator` drop-down listbox to select the operator that PEM will use when evaluating the current system values.

    Select a greater-than sign (&gt;) to indicate that the alert should be triggered when the system values are greater than the values entered in the Threshold values fields.

    Select a less-than sign (&lt;) to indicate that the alert should be triggered when the system values are less than the values entered in the Threshold values fields.

-   Use the threshold fields to specify the values that PEM will compare to the system values to determine if an alert should be raised. Please note that you must specify values for all three thresholds (Low, Medium, and High):

    Enter a value that will trigger a low-severity alert in the `Low` field.

    Enter a value that will trigger a medium-severity alert in the `Medium` field.

    Enter a value that will trigger a high-severity alert in the `High` field.

-   Use the `Check frequency` field to specify the default number of minutes between alert executions. This value specifies how often the server will invoke the SQL code specified in the definition and compare the result to the threshold value specified in the template.

![*The Probe Dependency tab of the Alert Templates dialog*](images/alert_template_probe_dependency.png)

Use the fields on the `Probe Dependency` tab to specify the names of probes referred to in the SQL query specified on the SQL tab:

-   Use the `Probes` drop-down listbox to select from a list of the available probes; highlight a probe name, and click the Add button to add the probe to the list of probes used by the alert template. To remove a probe from the selected probes list, highlight the probe name, and click the Delete icon.

![*The Parameters tab of the Alert Templates dialog*](images/alert_template_parameters.png)

-   Use fields on the `Parameters` tab to define the parameters that will be used in the SQL code specified on the `SQL` tab. Click the `Add` icon (+) and:

    Use the `Name` field to specify the parameter name.

    Use the `Data type` drop-down listbox to specify the type of parameter.

    Use the `Unit` field to specify the type of unit specified by the parameter.

-   Use the `Code` field on the `SQL` tab to provide the text of the SQL query that the server will invoke when executing the alert. The SQL query will provide the result against which the threshold value is compared; if the alert result deviates from the specified threshold value, an alert will be raised.

![*The SQL tab of the Alert Templates dialog*](images/alert_template_sql.png)

Within the query, parameters defined on the `Parameters` tab should be referenced sequentially by the variable [param]()*x*, where *x* indicates the position of the parameter definition within the parameter list. For example, param\_1 refers to the first parameter in the parameter list, param\_2 refers to the second parameter in the parameter list, and so on.

The query can also include the following pre-defined variables:

| **Variable Description** | **Variable Name**   |
|--------------------------|---------------------|
| agent identifier         | '${agent\_id}'      |
| server identifier        | '${server\_id}'     |
| database name            | '${database\_name}' |
| schema name              | '${schema\_name}'   |
| Table                    | '${object\_name}'   |
| index                    | '${object\_name}'   |
| sequence                 | '${object\_name}'   |
| function name            | '${object\_name}'   |

-   Use the `Detailed Information SQL` field to provide a SQL query that will be invoked if the alert is triggered. The result set of the query may be displayed as part of the detailed alert information on the Alerts dashboard or Global Overview dashboard.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

If the specified query is dependent on one or more probes from different levels within the PEM hierarchy (server, database, schema, etc.), and a probe becomes disabled, any resulting alerts will be displayed as follows:

</div>

-   If the alert definition and the probe referenced by the query are from the same level within the PEM hierarchy, the server will display any alerts that reference the alert template on the `Alert Error` table of the `Global Alert Dashboard`.
-   If the alert definition and the probe referenced by the query are from different levels of the PEM hierarchy, the server will display any triggered alerts that reference the alert template on the `Alert Details` table of the hierarchy on which the alert was defined.

Click the Save icon to save the alert template definition and add the template name to the Alert Templates list. After saving a custom alert template, you can use the Alerting dialog to define an alert based on the template.

**Modifying or Deleting an Alert Template**

To view the definition of an existing template (including PEM pre-defined alert templates), use the `Show System Template` drop-down listbox to select the type of object monitored. When you select the object type, the `Alert Templates` table will display the currently defined alert templates that correspond with that object type.

Highlight a Template Name in the list, and click the Edit icon (at the left end of the row) to review the template definition.

Use the tabs on the `Alert Templates` dialog to view detailed information about the alert template:

-   General information is displayed on the `General` tab.
-   The names of probes that provide data for the template are listed on the `Probe Dependency` tab.
-   The names of any parameters referred to in the SQL code are listed on the `Parameters` tab.
-   The SQL code that defines the behavior of the alert is displayed on the `SQL` tab.

To delete an alert template, highlight the template name in the alert templates table, and click the Delete icon. The alert history will persist for the length of time specified in the `History Retention` field in the template definition.

#### Creating a New Alert

The `Manage Alerts` tab displays a table of alerts that are defined on the object currently selected in the PEM client tree control. You can use the `Alerts` table to modify an existing alert, or to create a new alert.

![*The Manage Alerts tab*](images/manage_alerts_dashboard.png)

To open the alert editor and create a new alert, click the Add icon (+) in the upper-right corner of the table. The editor opens as shown below.

![*The General tab of the alert editor*](images/alert_editor_general.png)

Use the fields on the `General` tab to provide information about the alert:

-   Enter the name of the alert in the `Name` field.
-   Use the drop-down listbox in the `Template` field to select a template for the alert. An alert template is a function that uses one (or more) metrics or parameters to generate a value to which PEM compares user-specified alert boundaries. If the value returned by the template function evaluates to a value that is within the boundary of a user-defined alert (as specified by the Operator and Threshold values fields), PEM raises an alert, adds a notice to the Alerts overview display, and performs any actions specified on the template.
-   Use the `Enable?` switch to specify if the alert is enabled (Yes) or disabled (No).
-   Use the controls in the `Interval` box to specify how often the alert should confirm if the alert conditions are satisfied. Use the Minutes selector to specify an interval value. Use the Default switch to set or reset the Minutes value to the default (recommended) value for the selected template.
-   Use controls in the `History retention` box to specify the number of days that PEM will store data collected by the alert. Use the Days selector to specify the number of days that the data will be stored. Use the Default switch to set or reset the Days value to the default value (30 days).
-   Use controls in the `Threshold values` box to define the triggering criteria for the alert. When the value specified in the Threshold Values fields evaluates to greater-than or less-than the system value (as specified with the Operator), PEM will raise a Low, Medium or High level alert:
-   Use the `Operator` drop-down listbox to select the operator that PEM will use when evaluating the current system values:
    -   Select a greater-than sign (&gt;) to indicate that the alert should be triggered when the system values are greater than the values entered in the Threshold values fields.
    -   Select a less-than sign (&lt;) to indicate that the alert should be triggered when the system values are less than the values entered in the Threshold values fields.
-   Use the `threshold` fields to specify the values that PEM will compare to the system values to determine if an alert should be raised. Please note that you must specify values for all three thresholds (Low, Medium, and High):
    -   Enter a value that will trigger a low-severity alert in the `Low` field.
    -   Enter a value that will trigger a medium-severity alert in the `Medium` field.
    -   Enter a value that will trigger a high-severity alert in the `High` field.

The `Parameter Options` table contains a list of parameters that are required by the selected template; the table displays both pre-defined parameters, and parameters for which you must specify a value. Please note that you must specify a value for any parameter that displays a prompt in the Value column.

PEM can send a notification or execute a script if an alert is triggered, or if an alert is cleared. Use the `Notification` tab to specify how PEM will behave if an alert is raised.

![*The alert editor Notification tab*](images/alert_editor_notification.png)

Use the fields in the `Email notification` box to specify the email group that will receive an email notification if the alert is triggered at the specified level. Use the `Email Groups` tab to create an email group that contains the address of the user or users that will be notified when an alert is triggered. To access the `Email Groups` tab, click the Email Groups icon located in the Quick Links menu of the `Manage Alerts` tab.

-   To instruct PEM to send an email when a specific alert level is reached, set the slider next to an alert level to Yes, and use the drop-down listbox to select the pre-defined user or group that will be notified.

Please note that you must configure the PEM Server to use an SMTP server to deliver email before PEM can send email notifications.

Use the `Trap notification` options to configure trap notifications for this alert:

-   Set the `Send trap` slider to `Yes` to send SNMP trap notifications when the state of this alert changes.
-   Set the `SNMP Ver` slider to v1 or v2 to identify the SNMP version.
-   Use the `Low alert`, `Med alert` and `High`alert\`\` sliders to select the level(s) of alert that will trigger the trap. For example, if you set the slider next to High alert to Yes, PEM will send a notification when an alert with a high severity level is triggered.

Please note that you must configure the PEM Server to send notifications to an SNMP trap/notification receiver before notifications can be sent.

Use the field in the `Nagios notification` box to instruct the PEM server to notify Nagios network-alerting software when the alert is triggered or cleared.

-   Set the `Submit passive service check result to Nagios` switch to `Yes` to instruct the PEM server to notify Nagios when the alert is triggered or cleared.

Use the fields in the `Script execution` box to (optionally) define a script that will be executed if an alert is triggered, and to specify details about the script execution.

-   Set the `Execute script` slider to `Yes` to instruct PEM to execute the provided script if an alert is triggered.

-   Set the `Execute on alert cleared` slider to `Yes` to instruct PEM to execute the provided script when the situation that triggered the alert has been resolved.

-   Use the radio buttons next to `Execute script on` to indicate that the script should execute on the PEM Server or the Monitored Server.

-   Provide the script that PEM should execute in the `Code` field. You can provide a batch/shell script, or SQL code. Within the script, you can use placeholders for the following:

    `%AlertName%` - this placeholder will be replaced with the name of the triggered alert.

    `%ObjectName%` - this placeholder will be replaced with the name of the server or agent on which the alert was triggered.

    `%ThresholdValue%` - this placeholder will be replaced with the threshold value reached by the metric when the alert triggered.

    `%CurrentValue%` - this placeholder will be replaced with the current value of the metric that triggered the alert.

    `%CurrentState%` - this placeholder will be replaced with the current state of the alert.

    `%OldState%` - this placeholder will be replaced with the previous state of the alert.

    `%AlertRaisedTime%` - this placeholder will be replaced with the time that the alert was raised, or the most recent time that the alert state was changed.

When you have defined the alert attributes, click the edit icon to close the alert definition editor, and then the save icon (in the upper-right corner of the `Alerts` table). To discard your changes, click the refresh icon; a popup will ask you to confirm that you wish to discard the changes.

#### Modifying or Deleting an Alert

Use the `Alerts` table to manage an existing alert or create a new alert. Highlight an object in the PEM client tree control to view the alerts that monitor that object.

![*The Alerts table*](images/alerts_table.png)

You can modify some properties of an alert in the `Alerts` table:

-   The `Alert name` column displays the name of the alert; to change the alert name, simply replace the name in the table, and click the save icon.
-   The `Alert template` column displays the name of the alert template that specifies properties used by the alert. You can use the drop-down listbox to change the alert template associated with an alert.
-   Use the `Alert enable?` switch to specify if an alert is enabled (Yes) or disabled (No).
-   Use the `Interval` column to specify how often PEM should check to see if the alert conditions are satisfied. Set the `Default` switch to `No` and specify an alternate value (in Minutes), or return the Default switch to `Yes` to reset the value to its default setting. By default, PEM will check the status of each alert once every minute.
-   Use the `History retention` field to specify the number of days that PEM will store data collected by the alert. Set the `Default` switch to `No` and specify an alternate value (in Days), or return the Default switch to `Yes` to reset the value to its default setting. By default, PEM will recommend storing historical data for 30 days.

After modifying an alert, click the save icon (located in the upper-right corner of the table) to make your changes persistent.

Click the edit icon to the left of an alert name to open an editor that provides access to the complete alert definition to modify other alert attributes.

![*The Alert details dialog*](images/alert_details.png)

Use fields on the `Alert details` dialog to modify the definition of the selected alert. When you've finished modifying the alert definition, click `Save` to preserve your changes, or `Cancel` to exit the dialog without saving any changes.

**Deleting an Alert**

To mark an alert for deletion, highlight the alert name in the Alerts table and click the delete icon to the left of the name; the alert will remain in the list, but in red strike-through font.

![*Deleting an alert*](images/delete_alert.png)

The delete icon acts as a toggle; you can undo the deletion by clicking the delete icon a second time; when you click the Save icon, the alert definition will be permanently deleted.

#### Copying an Alert

To speed up the deployment of alerts in the PEM system, you can copy alert definitions from one object to one or more target objects.

To copy alerts from an object, highlight the object in the PEM client tree control on the main PEM window, and select the `Copy Alerts...` option from the `Management` menu. When the `Manage Alerts` tab opens, click the Copy Alerts icon (located in the Quick Links toolbar) to open the `Copy Alert Configuration` dialog.

![*The Copy Alert Configuration dialog*](images/copy_alert_configuration.png)

The `Copy Alert Configuration` dialog copies all alerts from the object highlighted in the PEM client tree control to the object or objects selected on the dialog. Expand the tree control to select a node or nodes to specify the target object(s). The tree control displays a red warning indicator next to the source object.

To copy alerts to multiple objects at once, select a parent node of the target(s). For example, to copy the alerts from one table to all tables in a schema, you can simply select the checkbox next to the schema. PEM will only copy alerts to targets that are of the same type as the source object.

Check the `Ignore duplicates` radio button to prevent PEM from updating any existing alerts on the target objects with the same name as those being copied. Use the `Replace duplicates` option to replace existing alerts with alerts of the same name from the source object.

Click the `Configure Alerts` button to proceed to copy the alerts from the source object to all objects of the same type in, or under those objects selected on the `Copy Alert Configuration` dialog.

#### Audit Log Alerting

PEM provides alert templates that allow you to use the `Alerting` dialog to create an alert that will trigger when an `ERROR` or `WARNING` statement is written to a log file for a specific server or agent. To open the `Alerting` dialog, highlight the name of the server or agent in the PEM client Object browser tree control, and select `Alerting...` from the `Management` menu.

To create an alert that will notify you of ERROR or WARNING messages in the log file for a specific server, create an alert that uses one of the following alert templates:

> Number of ERRORS in the logfile on server M in last X hours
>
> Number of WARNINGS in the logfile on server M in last X hours
>
> Number of ERRORS or WARNINGS in the logfile on server M in last X hours

To create an alert that will notify you of ERROR or WARNING messages for a specific agent, create an alert that uses one of the following alert templates:

> Number of ERRORS in the logfile on agent M in last X hours
>
> Number of WARNINGS in the logfile on agent M in last X hours
>
> Number of ERRORS or WARNINGS in the logfile on agent M in last X hours

Please note that this functionality is supported only on Advanced Server.

#### Creating an Email Group

Postgres Enterprise Manager monitors your system for conditions that require user attention. You can use an email group to specify the email addresses of users that the server will notify if current values deviate from threshold values specified in an alert definition. An email group has the flexibility to notify multiple users, or target specific users during user-defined time periods.

Please note that you must configure the PEM Server to use an SMTP server to deliver email before PEM can send email notifications.

Use the `Email Groups` tab to configure groups of SMTP email recipients. To access the `Email Groups` tab, select `Manage Alerts...` from the PEM client's `Management` menu; when the `Manage Alerts` tab opens, select `Email Groups` from the Quick Links toolbar.

![*The Email Groups tab*](images/email_groups_tab.png)

The `Email Groups` tab displays a list of the currently defined email groups. Highlight a group name and click the Edit icon (at the far left end of the row) to modify an existing group.

To define a new email group, click the Add icon (+) in the upper-right corner of the `Email Groups` table. The `Email Group` definition dialog opens.

![*Adding an email group*](images/adding_email_group.png)

Use the `Email Group` dialog to define an email group and its members:

-   Provide a name for the email group in the `Group Name` field.

Each row within the email group definition will associate a unique set of email addresses with a specific time period. When an alert is triggered, the server will evaluate the times specified in each row and send the message to those group members whose definitions are associated with the time that the alert triggered.

Click the Add icon (+) in the group members table to open the `Options` tab, and add the member addresses that will receive notifications for the time period specified:

-   Enter a comma-delimited list of recipient addresses in the `Reply` to Addresses field.
-   Enter a comma-delimited list of addresses that will receive a copy of the email in the `CC Addresses` field.
-   Enter a comma-delimited list of addresses that will receive a copy of the email (without the knowledge of other recipients) in the `Bcc Addresses` field.
-   Enter the email address that messages to this group should be sent from in the `From Address` field.
-   Use the `Subject prefix` field to provide a message that will be added to the start of each subject line when a notification is sent.
-   Use the `From Time` and `To`Time\`\` time selectors to specify the time range for notifications to the group member(s) that are identified on this row. Provide the From Time and To Time values in the locale of the PEM client host, and the PEM server will translate the time into other time zones as required.

When you've identified the member or members that will receive an email during a specific time period, click the Add icon to add a row to the table, and specify another time period and the email addresses that will be notified during those hours. When you've finished defining the email group, click the Save icon.

To delete an email group, highlight the name of the group in the `Email Group` table and click the Delete icon (located to the left of the group name).

![*Deleting an email group*](images/delete_email_group.png)

The group name will be displayed in the `Email Group` table in red; click the `Save` icon to make the change persistent and remove the group from the table.

After creating the email group, you can use the `Manage Alerts` tab to set up the `Notification` details for an alert that will direct notifications to the group.

### Using PEM with Nagios



The PEM server can send a passive alert result to Nagios network-alerting software when a user-defined alert is triggered. To instruct the PEM server to notify Nagios of a triggered alert, you must:

-   Enable Nagios notification for each alert that will trigger a notification from the PEM server to Nagios. Please note that PEM alerting must be configured before you create the `host.cfg` file, the `services.cfg` file, or configure Nagios.
-   Configure Nagios-related behaviors of the PEM server.
-   Create the `host.cfg` and `services.cfg` configuration files.
-   If necessary, modify the Nagios configuration file and restart the server.

After configuring the server to enable Nagios alerting, any triggered alerts will send a passive check result to the Nagios service. The syntax of a passive alert is:

> `<timestamp> PROCESS_SERVICE_CHECK_RESULT; <host_name> ; <service_name> ; <service_status> ;`

Where:

*timestamp* is the date and time that the alert was triggered.

*host\_name* is the name of the server or agent.

*service\_name* is the name of the alert.

*service\_status* is the numeric service status value:

> 0 if the service status is OK  
> 1 if the service status is WARNING  
> 2 if the service status is CRITICAL  
> 3 if the service status is UNKNOWN

The PEM server uses the following rules to evaluate the service status:

-   If the PEM alert level is CLEARED, the warning message will read OK.
-   If the PEM alert level is LOW, the warning message will read WARNING.
-   If the `is_nagios_medium_alert_as_critical` flag (specified in the PEM server configuration dialog) is set to FALSE and the alert level MEDIUM, the warning message will read WARNING.
-   If the `is_nagios_medium_alert_as_critical` flag (specified in the PEM server configuration dialog) is set to TRUE and the alert level is MEDIUM, the warning message will read CRITICAL.
-   If the PEM alert level is `HIGH`, the warning message will read `CRITICAL`.

#### Enabling Nagios Notification for an Alert



The PEM server maintains a unique set of notification properties for each enabled alert. Use the `Notification` tab of the `Manage Alerts` tab to specify that (when triggered), a given alert will send an alert notice to Nagios.

To modify the notification properties of an alert, right-click on the name of the object monitored by the alert, and select `Manage Alerts...` from the `Management` menu. When the `Manage Alerts` tab opens, locate the alert, and then click the edit button to the left of the alert name in the `Alerts` list. When the edit pane opens, select the `Notification` tab.

![*The Notification tabg*](images/nagios_notification.png)

To enable Nagios notification, move the slider next to `Submit passive service check result` to Nagios to `Yes`; before exiting the `Manage Alerts` tab, click the save icon to preserve your changes.

#### Configuring Nagios-related behavior of the PEM Server



You can use the `Server Configuration` dialog to provide information about your Nagios configuration to the PEM server. To open `Server Configuration` dialog, select `Server Configuration...` from the PEM client's `Management` menu.

![*Specify Nagios properties in the Server Configuration dialog*](images/nagios_server_configuration.png)

Four server configuration parameters specify information about your Nagios installation and PEM server behavior related to Nagios:

-   Use the `nagios_cmd_file_name` parameter to specify the location of the Nagios pipeline file that will receive passive check alerts from PEM. The default value of this parameter is `/usr/local/nagios/var/rw/nagios.cmd`. If your `nagios.cmd` file resides in an alternate location, specify the file location in the Value field.

-   Move the slider in the `nagios_enabled` parameter to `Yes` to instruct the PEM server to send passive check alerts to Nagios.

-   Use the `nagios_medium_alert_as_critical` slider to specify the warning severity that the PEM server will pass to Nagios if a medium alert is triggered:

    If the `is_nagios_medium_alert_as_critical` flag is set to FALSE and the alert level is MEDIUM, the warning message will read WARNING.

    If the `is_nagios_medium_alert_as_critical` flag is set to TRUE and the alert level is MEDIUM, the warning message will read CRITICAL.

-   Use the `nagios_spool_retention_time` parameter to specify the number of days of notification history that will be stored on the PEM server. The default value is 7 days.

After modifying parameter values, click the save icon (in the upper-right corner of the `Server Configuration` dialog) to preserve your changes.

#### Creating the hosts.cfg and services.cfg File

The `templates.cfg` file (by default, located in `/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects`) specifies the properties of a generic-host and generic-service. The properties specify the parameters used in the `hosts.cfg` and `services.cfg` files.

In most cases (when PEM is installed in a default configuration), you will not be required to modify the `templates.cfg` file before creating the `hosts.cfg` and `services.cfg` files. If necessary, you can modify the `templates.cfg` file to specify alternate values for parameters or to create new templates.

Before modifying the Nagios configuration file, use the following command to create a `hosts.cfg` file that contains information about the PEM hosts that reside on the local system:

> `psql -U postgres -p 5433 -d pem -A -t -c "select pem.create_nagios_host_config('generic-host')" > /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/hosts.cfg`

Then, use the following command to create a `services.cfg` file that contains information about the PEM services that reside on the local system:

> `psql -U postgres -p 5433 -d pem -A -t -c "select pem.create_nagios_service_config('generic-service')" > /usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/services.cfg`

If you wish to use a `custom template.cfg` file entry, specify the entry name in place of generic-host or generic-service in the above commands.

#### Modifying the Nagios Configuration File



After creating the `host.cfg` and `services.cfg` files, you must specify their location in the Nagios configuration file (by default, `/usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg`). Modify the configuration file, adding entries that specify the location of the files:

> `cfg_file=/usr/local/etc/objects/hosts.cfg`
>
> `cfg_file=/usr/local/etc/objects/services.cfg`

You can use the following command to confirm that Nagios is properly configured:

> `/usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -v /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg`

After confirming that Nagios is configured correctly, restart the Nagios service:

> `/usr/local/nagios/bin/nagios -d /usr/local/nagios/etc/nagios.cfg`
