## Toolbar Options

Toolbar options on the SQL Profiler tab allow you to define new traces, start or stop existing traces, open and search through previous traces, and filter trace results.

Use the following options to manage your SQL Profiler traces:

## Viewing Trace Data

The SQL Profiler tab is divided into three panes:

-   The top of the tabbed browser window (the trace data pane) displays a list of the SQL commands executed during the trace.
-   The lower-left panel dislays the SQL query that was executed, or the metrics gathered during the execution.
-   The lower-right panel displays the query execution plan; you can view the execution plan in a Text-based form, or as a Graphical Plan.

![SQL Profiler tab](../images/sp_sql_profiler_tab.png)

**The Trace Data Pane**

The Trace Data pane displays the SQL commands executed during the trace. By default, the commands are displayed in the order that the command was executed.

Double-click a column heading to sort the trace by the column values; double-click the column heading a second time to toggle the data in the column to be in ascending or descending order.

Use the drop-down listbox next to the `Show queries per page` label to specify the number of events that SQL Profiler should display in the pane. Select from 20, 50, 100, 200, 500, 1000, or 2000. The default is 500.

If the number of events in the trace exceeds the count of events per page, use the page selector controls (located in the top left corner of the table) to navigate through pages of the trace.

To include or exclude events from the currently displayed trace, select the Filter icon from the SQL Profiler toolbar. The Trace Filter dialog will allow you to define and apply a filter that will screen the displayed trace.

**The Query/Metrics Pane**

The Query/Metrics pane is located in the lower-left corner of the SQL Profiler window. The tabs provide detailed information about the currently selected query:

-   The `SQL Query` tab displays the text of the query that is currently highlighted in Trace Data pane.
-   The `Metrics` tab displays detailed statistical information about the execution of the query. The table below describes the metrics that are displayed in the Metrics dialog; the percentages listed describe the percentage of the total quantity of the parameter that is attributed to the selected SQL command:

| **Property**                 | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                    |

| Execution (%)                | The percentage of the execution count that the SQL command represents. For example if the trace profiles 4 SQL commands, each command will represent 25% of the trace execution %. |

The Graphical or Text-based explain pane displays one of two representations of the query execution plan for the selected query.

-   Select the Text-based Plan tab to display the execution plan for the currently highlighted event in text format:
-   Select the Graphical-based Plan tab to display a graphical interpretation of the execution plan of the highlighted query. For more information about interpreting the graphical query plan, see [Interpreting the Graphical Query Plan](../08_toc_pem_developer_tools/03_pem_interpreting_graphical_query/#pem_interpreting_graphical_query).
