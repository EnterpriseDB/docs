<div id="editgrid" class="registered_link"></div>


To review or modify data, right click on a table or view name in the `Browser` tree control. When the context menu opens, use the `View/Edit Data` menu to specify the number of rows you would like to display in the editor panel.

To modify the content of a table, each row in the table must be uniquely identifiable. If the table definition does not include an OID or a primary key, the displayed data is read only. Note that views cannot be edited; updatable views (using rules) are not supported.

The editor features a toolbar that allows quick access to frequently used options, and a work environment divided into two panels:

-   The upper panel displays the SQL command that was used to select the content displayed in the lower panel.
-   The lower panel (the Data Grid) displays the data selected from the table or view.

**The View/Edit Data Toolbar**

The toolbar includes context-sensitive icons that provide shortcuts to frequently performed tasks.

Hover over an icon to display a tooltip that describes the icon's functionality.

**The Data Grid**

The top row of the data grid displays the name of each column, the data type, and if applicable, the number of characters allowed. A column that is part of the primary key will additionally be marked with \[PK\].

<div id="data-grid" class="registered_link"></div>

To modify the displayed data:

-   To change a numeric value within the grid, double-click the value to select the field. Modify the content in the square in which it is displayed.
-   To change a non-numeric value within the grid, double-click the content to access the edit bubble. After modifying the contentof the edit bubble, click the `Save` button to display your changes in the data grid, or `Cancel` to exit the edit bubble without saving.

To enter a newline character, click Ctrl-Enter or Shift-Enter. Newline formatting is only displayed when the field content is accessed via an edit bubble.

To add a new row to the table, enter data into the last (unnumbered) row of the table. As soon as you store the data, the row is assigned a row number, and a fresh empty line is added to the data grid.

To write a SQL NULL to the table, simply leave the field empty. When you store the new row, the will server fill in the default value for that column. If you store a change to an existing row, the value NULL will explicitly be written.

To write an empty string to the table, enter the special string '' (two single quotes) in the field. If you want to write a string containing solely two single quotes to the table, you need to escape these quotes, by typing ''

To delete a row, press the `Delete` toolbar button. A popup will open, asking you to confirm the deletion.

To commit the changes to the server, select the `Save` toolbar button. Modifications to a row are written to the server automatically when you select a different row.

**Geometry Data Viewer**

If PostGIS is installed, you can view GIS objects in a map by selecting row(s) and clicking the 'View Geometry' button in the column. If no rows are selected, the entire data set will be rendered:

![Geometry Viewer button](../../images/geometry_viewer.png)

You can adjust the layout by dragging the title of the panel. To view the properties of the geometries directly in map, just click the specific geometry:

![Geometry Viewer - Property Table](../../images/geometry_viewer_property_table.png)

Notes:

-   `Supported data types:` The Geometry Viewer supports 2D and 3DM geometries in EWKB format including <span class="title-ref">Point, LineString, Polygon MultiPoint, MultiLineString, MultiPolygon and GeometryCollection</span>.
-   `SRIDs:` If there are geometries with different SRIDs in the same column, the viewer will render geometries with the same SRID in the map. If SRID=4326 the OSM tile layer will be added into the map.
-   `Data size:` For performance reasons, the viewer will render no more than 100000 geometries, totaling up to 20MB.
-   `Internet access:` An internet connection is required for the Geometry Viewer to function correctly.

**Sort/Filter options dialog**

You can access `Sort/Filter options dialog` by clicking on Sort/Filter button. This allows you to specify an SQL Filter to limit the data displayed and data sorting options in the edit grid window:

![Edit grid filter dialog window](../../images/editgrid_filter_dialog.png)

-   Use `SQL Filter` to provide SQL filtering criteria. These will be added to the "WHERE" clause of the query used to retrieve the data. For example, you might enter:

``` sql
id > 25 AND created > '2018-01-01'
```

-   Use `Data Sorting` to sort the data in the output grid

To add new column(s) in data sorting grid, click on the \[+\] icon.

-   Use the drop-down `Column` to select the column you want to sort.
-   Use the drop-down `Order` to select the sort order for the column.

To delete a row from the grid, click the trash icon.

-   Click the `Help` button (?) to access online help.
-   Click the `Ok` button to save work.
-   Click the `Close` button to discard current changes and close the dialog.
