<div id="pem_scheduled_task_tab" class="registered_link"></div>

You can schedule the execution of user-defined tasks on registered servers for a time that is most convenient, and least intrusive to your users. Tasks may be one-off, or recurring and are comprised of one or more steps, which may be a SQL script, a batch/shell script, or an internal function in the PEM agent. You can view pending tasks on the *Scheduled Tasks tab.*

To open the `Scheduled Tasks` tab, select either a PEM Agent or a managed server in the tree control of the PEM client and select `Scheduled Tasks...` from the `Management` menu.
