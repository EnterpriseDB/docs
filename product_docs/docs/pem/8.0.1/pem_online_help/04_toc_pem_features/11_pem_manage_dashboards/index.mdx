PEM displays performance statistics through a number of system-defined dashboards; each dashboard contains a series of summary views that contain charts, graphs and tables that display statistics related to the selected object. You can use the Manage Dashboards tab to create and manage custom dashboards that display the information that is most relevant to your system.
