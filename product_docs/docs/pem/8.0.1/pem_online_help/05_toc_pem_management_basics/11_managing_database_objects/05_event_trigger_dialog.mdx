Use the `Domain Trigger` dialog to define an event trigger. Unlike regular triggers, which are attached to a single table and capture only DML events, event triggers are global to a particular database and are capable of capturing DDL events. Like regular triggers, event triggers can be written in any procedural language that includes event trigger support, or in C, but not in SQL.

The `Domain Trigger` dialog organizes the development of a event trigger through the following dialog tabs: `General`, `Definition`, and `Security Labels`. The `SQL` tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

![Create Event Trigger dialog - General tab](../../images/event_trigger_general.png)

Use the fields in the `General` tab to identify the event trigger:

-   Use the `Name` field to add a descriptive name for the event trigger. The name will be displayed in the `Browser` tree control.
-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Owner` to specify the owner of the event trigger.
-   Store notes about the event trigger in the `Comment` field.

Click the `Definition` tab to continue.

![Create Event Trigger dialog - Definition tab](../../images/event_trigger_definition.png)

Use the fields in the `Definition` tab to define the event trigger:

-   Select a value from the drop down of `Trigger Enabled` field to specify a status Select a value from the drop down of `Trigger Enabled` field to specify a status
-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Trigger function` to specify an existing function. A trigger function takes an empty argument list, and returns a value of type event_trigger.
-   Select a value from the drop down of `Events` field to specify when the event trigger will fire: `DDL COMMAND START`, `DDL COMMAND END`, or `SQL DROP`.
-   Use the `When TAG in` field to enter filter values for TAG for which the trigger will be executed. The values must be in single quotes separated by comma.

Click the `Security Labels` tab to continue.

![Create Event Trigger dialog - Security tab](../../images/event_trigger_security.png)

Use the `Security` tab to define security labels applied to the trigger. Click the `Add` icon (+) to add each security label.

-   Specify a security label provider in the `Provider` field. The named provider must be loaded and must consent to the proposed labeling operation.
-   Specify a security label in the `Security Label` field. The meaning of a given label is at the discretion of the label provider. PostgreSQL places no restrictions on whether or how a label provider must interpret security labels; it merely provides a mechanism for storing them.

Click the `Add` icon (+) to assign additional security labels; to discard a security label, click the trash icon to the left of the row and confirm deletion in the `Delete Row` popup.

Click the `SQL` tab to continue.

Your entries in the `Domain Trigger` dialog generate a generate a SQL command. Use the `SQL` tab for review; revisit or switch tabs to make any changes to the SQL command.

**Example**

The following is an example of the sql command generated by user selections in the `Domain Trigger` dialog:

![Create Event Trigger dialog - SQL tab](../../images/event_trigger_sql.png)

The command creates an event trigger named `accounts` that invokes the procedure named `acct_due`.

-   Click the `Info` button (i) to access online help. View context-sensitive help in the `Tabbed browser`, where a new tab displays the PostgreSQL core documentation.
-   Click the `Save` button to save work.
-   Click the `Cancel` button to exit without saving work.
-   Click the `Reset` button to restore configuration parameters.
