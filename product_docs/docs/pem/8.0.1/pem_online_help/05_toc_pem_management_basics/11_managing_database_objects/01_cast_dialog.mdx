Use the `Cast` dialog to define a cast. A cast specifies how to convert a value from one data type to another.

The `Cast` dialog organizes the development of a cast through the following dialog tabs: `General` and `Definition`. The `SQL` tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

Use the fields in the `General` tab to identify the cast:

-   The `Name` field is disabled. The name that will be displayed in the `Browser` tree control is the `Source` type concatenated with the `Target` type, and is generated automatically when you make selections on the `Cast` dialog `Definition` tab.
-   Store notes about the cast in the `Comment` field.

Click the `Definition` tab to continue.

Use the fields in the `Definition` tab to define parameters:

-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Source type` to select the name of the source data type of the cast.
-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Target type` to select the name of the target data type of the cast.
-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Function` to select the function used to perform the cast. The function's result data type must match the target type of the cast.
-   Move the `Context` switch to the `Implicit` position if the cast is implicit. By default, a cast can be invoked only by an explicit cast request. If the cast is marked `Implicit` then it can be invoked implicitly in any context, whether by assignment or internally in an expression.

Click the `SQL` tab to continue.

Your entries in the `Cast` dialog generate a SQL command (see an example below). Use the `SQL` tab for review; revisit or switch tabs to make any changes to the SQL command.

**Example**

The following is an example of the sql command generated by user selections in the `Cast` dialog:

The cast uses a function named `int4(bigint)` to convert a biginteger data type to an integer.
