Use the CREATE LANGUAGE dialog to register a new procedural language.

The `Language` dialog organizes the registration of a procedural language through the following dialog tabs: `General`, `Definition`, and `Security`. The `SQL` tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

Use the fields in the `General` tab to identify a language:

-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Name` to select a language script.
-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Owner` to select a role.
-   Store notes about the language in the `Comment` field.

Click the `Definition` tab to continue.

![Create Language dialog - Definition tab](../../images/language_definition.png)

Use the fields in the `Definition` tab to define parameters:

-   Move the `Trusted?` switch to the `No` position to specify only users with PostgreSQL superuser privilege can use this language. The default is `Yes`.
-   When enabled, use the drop-down listbox next to `Handler Function` to select the function that will be called to execute the language's functions.
-   When enabled, use the drop-down listbox next to `Inline Function` to select the function that will be called to execute an anonymous code block (DO command) in this language.
-   When enabled, use the drop-down listbox next to `Validator Function` to select the function that will be called when a new function in the language is created, to validate the new function.

Click the `Security` tab to continue.

Use the `Security` tab to assign privileges and define security labels.

Use the `Privileges` panel to assign privileges to a role. Click the `Add` icon (+) to set privileges for database objects:

-   Select the name of the role from the drop-down listbox in the `Grantee` field.
-   Click inside the `Privileges` field. Check the boxes to the left of one or more privileges to grant the selected privilege to the specified user.
-   The current user, who is the default grantor for granting the privilege, is displayed in the `Grantor` field.

Click the `Add` icon (+) to assign additional privileges; to discard a privilege, click the trash icon to the left of the row and confirm deletion in the `Delete Row` popup.

Use the `Security Labels` panel to define security labels applied to the function. Click the `Add` icon (+) to add each security label selection:

-   Specify a security label provider in the `Provider` field. The named provider must be loaded and must consent to the proposed labeling operation.
-   Specify a a security label in the `Security Label` field. The meaning of a given label is at the discretion of the label provider. PostgreSQL places no restrictions on whether or how a label provider must interpret security labels; it merely provides a mechanism for storing them.

Click the `Add` icon (+) to assign additional security labels; to discard a security label, click the trash icon to the left of the row and confirm deletion in the `Delete Row` popup.

Click the `SQL` tab to continue.

Your entries in the `Language` dialog generate a SQL command (see an example below). Use the `SQL` tab for review; revisit or switch tabs to make any changes to the SQL command.

**Example**

The following is an example of the sql command generated by user selections in the `Language` dialog:

"The example shown demonstrates creating the procedural language named `plperl`."

-   Click the `Info` button (i) to access online help. View context-sensitive help in the `Tabbed browser`, where a new tab displays the PostgreSQL core documentation.
-   Click the `Save` button to save work.
-   Click the `Cancel` button to exit without saving work.
-   Click the `Reset` button to restore configuration parameters.
