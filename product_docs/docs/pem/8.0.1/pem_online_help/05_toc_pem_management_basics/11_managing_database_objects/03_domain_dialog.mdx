Use the `Domain` dialog to define a domain. A domain is a data type definition that may constrain permissible values. Domains are useful when you are creating multiple tables that contain comparable columns; you can create a domain that defines constraints that are common to the columns and re-use the domain definition when creating the columns, rather than individually defining each set of constraints.

The `Domain` dialog organizes the development of a domain through the following tabs: `General`, `Definition`, `Constraints`, and `Security`. The `SQL` tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

Use the fields on the `General` tab to identify a domain:

-   Use the `Name` field to add a descriptive name for the domain. The name will be displayed in the `Browser` tree control.
-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Owner` to select a role that will own the domain.
-   Select the name of the schema in which the domain will reside from the drop-down listbox in the `Schema` field.
-   Store notes about the domain in the `Comment` field.

Click the `Definition` tab to continue.

![Create Domain dialog - Definition tab](../../images/domain_definition.png)

Use the fields in the `Definition` tab to describe the domain:

-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Base type` to specify a data type.
-   Use the context-sensitive `Length` field to specify a numeric length for a numeric type.
-   Use the context-sensitive `Precision` field to specify the total count of significant digits for a numeric type.
-   Specify a default value for the domain data type in the `Default` field. The data type of the default expression must match the data type of the domain. If no default value is specified, then the default value is the null value.
-   Move the `Not Null` switch to specify the values of this domain are prevented from being null.
-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Collation` to apply a collation cast. If no collation is specified, the underlying data type's default collation is used. The underlying type must be collatable if COLLATE is specified.

Click the `Constraints` tab to continue.

![Create Domain dialog - Constraints tab](../../images/domain_constraints.png)

Use the fields in the `Constraints` tab to specify rules for the domain. Click the `Add` icon (+) to set constraints:

-   Use the `Name` field to specify a name for the constraint.
-   Use the `Check` field to provide an expression for the constraint.
-   Use the `Validate` checkbox to determine whether the constraint will be validated. The default checkbox is checked and sets a validation requirement.

A CHECK clause specifies an integrity test which values of the domain must satisfy. Each constraint must be an expression that produces a Boolean result. Use the key word VALUE to refer to the value being tested. Expressions evaluating to TRUE or UNKNOWN succeed. If the expression produces a FALSE result, an error is reported and the value is not allowed to be converted to the domain type. A CHECK expression cannot contain subqueries nor refer to variables other than VALUE. If a domain has multiple CHECK constraints, they will be tested in alphabetical order by name.

Click the `Add` icon (+) to set additional constraints; to discard a constraint, click the trash icon to the left of the row and confirm deletion in the `Delete Row` popup.

Click the `Security` tab to continue.

![Create Domain dialog - Security tab](../../images/domain_security.png)

Use the `Security Labels` panel to assign security labels. Click the `Add` icon (+) to add a label:

-   Specify a security label provider in the `Provider` field. The named provider must be loaded and must consent to the proposed labeling operation.
-   Specify a a security label in the `Security Label` field. The meaning of a given label is at the discretion of the label provider. PostgreSQL places no restrictions on whether or how a label provider must interpret security labels; it merely provides a mechanism for storing them.

Click the `Add` icon (+) to specify each additional label; to discard a label, click the trash icon to the left of the row and confirm deletion in the `Delete Row` popup.

Click the `SQL` tab to continue.

Your entries in the `Domain` dialog generate a SQL command (see an example below). Use the `SQL` tab for review; revisit or switch tabs to make any changes to the SQL command.

**Example**

The following is an example of the sql command generated by selections made in the `Domain` dialog:

![Create Domain dialog - SQL tab](../../images/domain_sql.png)

The example shown demonstrates creating a domain named `minimum-wage` that confirms that the value entered is greater than or equal to `7.25`.

-   Click the `Info` button (i) to access online help. View context-sensitive help in the `Tabbed browser`, where a new tab displays the PostgreSQL core documentation.
-   Click the `Save` button to save work.
-   Click the `Cancel` button to exit without saving work.
-   Click the `Reset` button to restore configuration parameters.
