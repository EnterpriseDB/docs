Use the `Table` dialog to create or modify a table.

The `Table` dialog organizes the development of a table through the following dialog tabs: `General`, *Columns*, `Constraints`, *Advanced*, `Parameter`, and `Security`. The `SQL` tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

![Create Table dialog - General tab](../../images/table_general.png)

Use the fields in the `General` tab to identify the table:

-   Use the `Name` field to add a descriptive name for the table. A table cannot have the same name as any existing table, sequence, index, view, foreign table, or data type in the same schema. The name specified will be displayed in the `Browser` tree control. This field is required.
-   Select the owner of the table from the drop-down listbox in the `Owner` field. By default, the owner of the table is the role that creates the table.
-   Select the name of the schema in which the table will reside from the drop-down listbox in the `Schema` field.
-   Use the drop-down listbox in the `Tablespace` field to specify the tablespace in which the table will be stored.
-   Move the `Partitioned Table?` switch to the `Yes` in case you want to create a partitioned table. Option is available for PostgreSQL 10 and above.
-   Store notes about the table in the `Comment` field.

Click the `Columns` tab to continue.

![Create Table dialog - Columns tab](../../images/table_columns.png)

Use the drop-down listbox next to `Inherited from table(s)` to specify any parent table(s); the table will inherit columns from the selected parent table(s). Click inside the `Inherited from table(s)` field to select a table name from a drop-down list. Repeat to add any other parent tables. Delete a selected table by clicking the `x` to the left of the parent name. Note that inherited column names and datatypes are not editable in the current dialog; they must be modified at the parent level.

Click the `Add` icon (+) to specify the names of columns and their datatypes in the `Columns` table:

-   Use the `Name` field to add a descriptive name for the column.
-   Use the drop-down listbox in the `Data type` field to select a data type for the column. This can include array specifiers. For more information on the data types supported by PostgreSQL, refer to Chapter 8 of the core documentation.
-   If enabled, use the `Length` and `Precision` fields to specify the maximum number of significant digits in a numeric value, or the maximum number of characters in a text value.
-   Move the `Not NULL?` switch to the `Yes` position to require a value in the column field.
-   Move the `Primary key?` switch to the `Yes` position to specify the column is the primary key constraint.

> Click the `Add` icon (+) to add additional columns; to discard a column, click the trash icon to the left of the row and confirm deletion in the `Delete Row` popup.

Click the `Constraints` tab to continue.

![Create Table dialog - Constraints tab - Primary Key](../../images/table_primary_constraints_general.png)

Use the fields in the `Constraints` tab to provide a table or column constraint. Optional constraint clauses specify constraints (tests) that new or updated rows must satisfy for an `INSERT` or `UPDATE` operation to succeed. Select the appropriate constraint type by selecting one of the following tabs on the `Constraints` panel:

| Tab Name      | Constraint                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Primary Key` | Provides a unique identifier for each row in the table.                                                                                                                                |
| `Foreign Key` | Maintains referential integrity between two tables.                                                                                                                                    |
| `Check`       | Requires data satisfies an expression or condition before insertion or modification.                                                                                                   |
| `Unique`      | Ensures that the data contained in a column, or a group of columns, is unique among all the rows in the table.                                                                         |
| `Exclude`     | Guarantees that if any two rows are compared on the specified column or expression (using the specified operator), at least one of the operator comparisons will return false or null. |

To add a primary key for the table, select the `Primary Key` tab, and click the `Add` icon (+). To define the primary key, click the `Edit` icon to the left of the `Trash` icon. A dialog similar to the `Primary key` dialog (accessed by right clicking on `Constraints` in the `Browser` tree control) opens.

Use the fields in the `General` tab to identify the primary key:

-   Use the `Name` field to add a descriptive name for the primary key constraint. The name will be displayed in the `Browser` tree control.
-   Provide notes about the primary key in the `Comment` field.

Click the `Definition` tab to continue.

![Create Table dialog - Constraints tab - Primary Key Constraint definition](../../images/table_primary_key_definition.png)

Use the fields in the `Definition` tab to define the primary key constraint:

-   Click inside the `Columns` field and select one or more column names from the drop-down listbox. To delete a selection, click the `x` to the left of the column name. The primary key constraint should be different from any unique constraint defined for the same table; the selected column(s) for the constraints must be distinct.
-   Select the name of the tablespace in which the primary key constraint will reside from the drop-down listbox in the `Tablespace` field.
-   Use the `Fill Factor` field to specify a fill factor for the table and index. The fill factor for a table is a percentage between 10 and 100. 100 (complete packing) is the default.
-   Move the `Deferrable?` switch to the `Yes` position to specify the timing of the constraint is deferrable and can be postponed until the end of the statement. The default is `No`.
-   If enabled, move the `Deferred?` switch to the `Yes` position to specify the timing of the constraint is deferred to the end of the statement. The default is `No`.

![Create Table dialog - Foreign Key Constraint](../../images/table_foreign_key_general.png)

To add a foreign key constraint, select the `Foreign Key` tab, and click the `Add` icon (+). To define the constraint, click the `Edit` icon to the left of the `Trash` icon. A dialog similar to the `Foreign key` dialog (accessed by right clicking on `Constraints` in the `Browser` tree control) opens.

Use the fields in the `General` tab to identify the foreign key constraint:

-   Use the `Name` field to add a descriptive name for the foreign key constraint. The name will be displayed in the `Browser` tree control.
-   Provide notes about the foreign key in the `Comment` field.

Click the `Definition` tab to continue.

![Create Table dialog - Constraints tab - Foreign Key Constraint definition](../../images/table_foreign_key_definition.png)

Use the fields in the `Definition` tab to define the foreign key constraint:

-   Move the `Deferrable?` switch to the `Yes` position to specify the timing of the constraint is deferrable and can be postponed until the end of the statement. The default is `No`.

-   If enabled, move the `Deferred?` switch to the `Yes` position to specify the timing of the constraint is deferred to the end of the statement. The default is `No`.

-   Move the `Match type` switch specify the type of matching that is enforced by the constraint:

    > -   Select `Full` to indicate that all columns of a multicolumn foreign key must be null if any column is null; if all columns are null, the row is not required to have a match in the referenced table.
    > -   Select `Simple` to specify that a single foreign key column may be null; if any column is null, the row is not required to have a match in the referenced table.

-   Move the `Validated` switch to the `Yes` position to instruct the server to validate the existing table content (against a foreign key or check constraint) when you save modifications to this dialog.

-   Move the `Auto FK Index` switch to the `No` position to disable the automatic index feature.

-   The field next to `Covering Index` generates the name of an index if the `Auto FK Index` switch is in the `Yes` position; or, this field is disabled.

Click the `Columns` tab to continue.

![Create Table dialog - Constraints tab - Foreign Key Constraint columns](../../images/table_foreign_key_columns.png)

Use the fields in the `Columns` tab to specify one or more reference column(s). A Foreign Key constraint requires that one or more columns of a table must only contain values that match values in the referenced column(s) of a row of a referenced table:

-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Local column` to specify the column in the current table that will be compared to the foreign table.
-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `References` to specify the name of the table in which the comparison column(s) resides.
-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `Referencing` to specify a column in the foreign table.

Click the `Add` icon (+) to add a column to the list; repeat the steps above and click the `Add` icon (+) to add additional columns. To discard an entry, click the trash icon to the left of the entry and confirm deletion in the `Delete Row` popup.

Click the `Action` tab to continue.

![Create Table dialog - Constraints tab - Foreign Key Constraint action](../../images/table_foreign_key_action.png)

Use the drop-down listboxes on the `Action` tab to specify behavior related to the foreign key constraint that will be performed when data within the table is updated or deleted:

-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `On update` to select an action that will be performed when data in the table is updated.
-   Use the drop-down listbox next to `On delete` to select an action that will be performed when data in the table is deleted.

The supported actions are:

|             |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| NO ACTION   | Produce an error indicating that the deletion or update will create a foreign key constraint violation. If the constraint is deferred, this error will be produced at constraint check time if any referencing rows still exist. This is the default. |
| RESTRICT    | Throw an error indicating that the deletion or update would create a foreign key constraint violation. This is the same as NO ACTION except that the check is not deferrable.                                                                         |
| CASCADE     | Delete any rows referencing the deleted row, or update the values of the referencing column(s) to the new values of the referenced columns, respectively.                                                                                             |
| SET NULL    | Set the referencing column(s) to null.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| SET DEFAULT | Set the referencing column(s) to their default values. There must be a row in the referenced table that matches the default values (if they are not null), or the operation will fail.                                                                |
