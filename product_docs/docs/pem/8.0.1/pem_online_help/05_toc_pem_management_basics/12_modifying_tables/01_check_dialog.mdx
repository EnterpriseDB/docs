Use the `Check` dialog to define or modify a check constraint. A check constraint specifies an expression that produces a Boolean result that new or updated rows must satisfy for an insert or update operation to succeed.

The `Check` dialog organizes the development of a check constraint through the `General` and `Definition` tabs. The `SQL` tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

Use the fields in the `General` tab to identify the check constraint:

-   Use the `Name` field to provide a descriptive name for the check constraint that will be displayed in the `Browser` tree control. With PostgreSQL 9.5 forward, when a table has multiple check constraints, they will be tested for each row in alphabetical order by name and after NOT NULL constraints.
-   Store notes about the check constraint in the `Comment` field.

Click the `Definition` tab to continue.

Use the fields in the `Definition` tab to define the check constraint:

-   Provide the expression that a row must satisfy in the `Check` field.
-   Move the `No Inherit?` switch to the `Yes` position to specify this constraint is automatically inherited by a table's children. The default is `No`.
-   Move the `Don't validate?` switch to the `No` position to skip validation of existing data; the constraint may not hold for all rows in the table. The default is `Yes`.

Click the `SQL` tab to continue.

Your entries in the `Check` dialog generate a SQL command (see an example below). Use the `SQL` tab for review; revisit or switch tabs to make any changes to the SQL command.

**Example**

The following is an example of the sql command generated by user selections in the `Check` dialog:

The example shown demonstrates creating a check constraint named `check_price` on the `price` column of the `products` table. The constraint confirms that any values added to the column are greater than 0.
