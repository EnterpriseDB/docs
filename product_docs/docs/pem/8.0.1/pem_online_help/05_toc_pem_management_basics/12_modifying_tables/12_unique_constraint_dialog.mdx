Use the `Unique constraint` dialog to define a unique constraint for a specified table. Unique constraints ensure that the data contained in a column, or a group of columns, is unique among all the rows in the table.

The `Unique constraint` dialog organizes the development of a unique constraint through the following dialog tabs: `General` and `Definition`. The `SQL` tab displays the SQL code generated by dialog selections.

Use the fields in the `General` tab to identify the unique constraint:

-   Use the `Name` field to add a descriptive name for the unique constraint. The name will be displayed in the `Browser` tree control.

Click the `Definition` tab to continue.

![Create Unique Constraint dialog - Definition tab](../../images/unique_constraint_definition.png)

Use the fields in the `Definition` tab to define the unique constraint:

-   Click inside the `Columns` field and select one or more column names from the drop-down listbox. To delete a selection, click the `x` to the left of the column name. The unique constraint should be different from the primary key constraint defined for the same table; the selected column(s) for the constraints must be distinct.
-   Use `Include columns` field to specify columns for `INCLUDE` clause of the constraint. This option is available in Postgres 11 and later.
-   Select the name of the tablespace in which the unique constraint will reside from the drop-down listbox in the `Tablespace` field.
-   Select the name of an index from the drop-down listbox in the `Index` field. This field is optional. Adding a unique constraint will automatically create a unique B-tree index on the column or group of columns listed in the constraint, and will force the column(s) to be marked NOT NULL.
-   Use the `Fill Factor` field to specify a fill factor for the table and index. The fill factor for a table is a percentage between 10 and 100. 100 (complete packing) is the default.
-   Move the `Deferrable?` switch to the `Yes` position to specify the timing of the constraint is deferrable and can be postponed until the end of the statement. The default is `No`.
-   If enabled, move the `Deferred?` switch to the `Yes` position to specify the timing of the constraint is deferred to the end of the statement. The default is `No`.

Click the `SQL` tab to continue.

Your entries in the `Unique constraint` dialog generate a SQL command (see an example below). Use the `SQL` tab for review; revisit or switch tabs to make any changes to the SQL command.

**Example**

The following is an example of the sql command generated by user selections in the `Unique constraint` dialog:

The example shown demonstrates creating a unique constraint named `name_con` on the `name` column of the `distributors` table.
