To harden your PEM deployment against attack, consider the following measures:

1. Ensure PEM itself, your operating system, and third party libraries are regularly updated. Without the most recent security patches, your system is vulnerable to cyberattacks.
   Please refer to the [Dependencies](../installing/dependencies.mdx) page to learn more about the system packages used by PEM.

2. Ensure the Postgres instance used as the PEM server is kept up to date and apply [Postgres security best practices](https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Security-best-practices-2020.pdf).

3. [Secure the web server](apache_httpd_security_configuration.mdx)

4. Configure the [security settings of the PEM web application](pem_application_configuration.mdx) as appropriate.
