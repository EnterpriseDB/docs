Postgres supports a number of authentication methods. Postgres and PEM authentication is controlled by the `pg_hba.conf` configuration file. Entries in the configuration file specify:

- Who can connect to a specific database
- The type of authentication required before that user is allowed to connect

For more information about the authentication methods supported by Postgres, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-methods.html).

PEM offers several robust authentication options to secure access to the PEM web interface and backend database. These methods range from standard database authentication enhanced by two-factor verification to enterprise-grade Single Sign-On (SSO) using Kerberos.

## 1. Two-factor authentication (2FA)

PEM supports 2FA to provide an additional layer of security beyond standard login credentials. It can be configured by modifying parameters in the `config_local.py` file.

- **Supported methods:**

    - **Email** &mdash; Sends a one-time verification code to the user's email address.

    - **Authenticator App** &mdash; Uses TOTP-based applications like Google Authenticator.

- **Key configurations:**

    - **MFA_ENABLED** &mdash; Set to `true` to enable the feature.

    - **MFA_FORCE_REGISTRATION** &mdash; When `true`, you must register for 2FA upon your next login.

- **Mail server:**

    For email-based 2FA, PEM can use its internal SMTP configuration or Flask-Mail.

## 2. Kerberos authentication

Kerberos provides a secure, ticket-based authentication mechanism for SSO environments. This configuration relies heavily on hostnames and DNS resolution across the Kerberos server, PEM server, and client machines.

### Linux-based kerberos

This method involves installing a Kerberos authentication server and configuring principals for both the PEM web application (HTTP) and the backend database (Postgres).

- **Keytabs** &mdash; Security keytabs are extracted from the Kerberos server and deployed to the PEM server to facilitate encrypted communication.

- **Authentication** &mdash; Users obtain tickets via the `kinit` utility. The pg_hba.conf file is updated to use the gss (Generic Security Service) method.

- **Documentation** &mdash; [Configuring Kerberos authentication on Linux](../configuring_authenticationconfiguring_the_pem_server_to_use_kerberos_authentication.mdx).

### Windows active directory (SSPI)

PEM can integrate with Windows Active Directory domain services for Kerberos authentication.
  
- **Service mapping** &mdash; Active Directory users are created and mapped specifically to HTTP and Postgres service principals.
 
- **Keytab generation** &mdash; The Windows `ktpass` utility is used to generate keytabs for Linux-based PEM servers to interact with the Windows domain.

- **Browser requirements** &mdash; Client browsers (Firefox/Chrome) must be configured to trust the PEM server URI for SPNEGO/Kerberos negotiation.
