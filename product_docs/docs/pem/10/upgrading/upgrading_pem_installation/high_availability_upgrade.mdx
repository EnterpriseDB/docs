title: "Upgrading a PEM installation on high-availability mode using HTTPD"
---

If you're using [Failover Manager for high availability](../../considerations/setup_ha_using_efm) on your PEM server, you can perform a major or minor upgrade of the PEM installation by updating the PEM packages.

This example uses these IP addresses:

-  Primary server: 172.17.0.2
-  Secondary server (standby): 172.17.0.3

The example upgrade is performed on a RHEL-based operating system where HTTPD is used for the web server services.

## Upgrading the packages

1.  On the primary server (172.17.0.2), update the PEM packages: 

    ```
    dnf update edb-pem
    ```

    Updating ensures that the latest version of the script required for the upgrade is available.

1.  Execute the upgrade script. It upgrades PEM to the latest available version and restarts the backend database, the web server, and the PEM agent: 

    ```
    /usr/edb/pem/bin/configure-pem-server.sh
    ``` 

1.  On the secondary standby server (172.17.0.3), update the PEM packages:

    ```
    dnf update edb-pem
    ```

1.  Copy the configuration files, certificate, and key from the primary server to the secondary server: 

    ```
    /etc/httpd/conf.d/edb-pem.conf
    /etc/httpd/conf.d/edb-ssl-pem.conf
    /usr/edb/pem/share/.install-config
    /usr/edb/pem/resources/server-pem.crt
    /usr/edb/pem/resources/server-pem.key
    /usr/edb/pem/web/pem.wsgi
    /usr/edb/pem/web/config_setup.py
    ```

    !!!note 
       If you have more than one standby server, update the packages and copy the configuration files, certificate, and key from the primary server to each standby instance.
    !!!

The upgrade is complete.
