The process of upgrading a PEM installation is platform specific. You can update a PEM agent or server on a Linux platform by using the native packages and on a Windows platform by using the PEM graphical installer available for Windows. 

Links to PEM installers and RPMs are available at the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/edb-postgres-enterprise-manager).
