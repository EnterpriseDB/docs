If you are upgrading from v4.0 (or an earlier version) of SQL Profiler, where the functions where created by loading the SQL file included in a plugin, first migrate to the extension and later update to 4.1:

```
# running as superuser
CREATE EXTENSION sql_profiler VERSION '4.0';

ALTER EXTENSION sql_profiler UPDATE TO '4.1';

```
