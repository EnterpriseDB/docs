Use the Postgres Enterprise Manager browser-based console to manage PEM agents.

The PEM agent executes tasks and reports statistics from the agent host and the monitored Postgres instances to the PEM server. A single PEM agent can monitor multiple installed instances of Postgres that reside on the same host where the agent is installed or on multiple remote hosts. It's also responsible for executing other tasks that you might schedule, such as server shutdowns, SQL Profiler traces, and custom jobs.

To manage the PEM agents, you can:

-  [Manage job notifications](managing_job_notifications)
-  [Manage scheduled jobs](managing_scheduled_jobs)
-  [Modify the agent configuration](modifying_agent_configuration)
-  [Review and modify agent properties](modifying_agent_properties)
-  [Set agent privileges](setting_agent_privileges)
