Use the Postgres Enterprise Manager browser-based console to manage PEM agents.

The PEM agent is responsible for executing tasks and reporting statistics from the agent host and the monitored Postgres instances to the PEM server. A single PEM agent can monitor multiple installed instances of Postgres that reside on the same host where the agent is installed or on multiple remote hosts. It's also responsible for executing other tasks that the user might schedule, such as server shutdowns, SQL Profiler traces, and custom jobs.

You can perform the following tasks to manage the PEM agents:

-  [Managing job notifications](managing_job_notifications)
-  [Managing scheduled jobs](managing_scheduled_jobs)
-  [Modifying agent configuration](modifying_agent_configuration)
-  [Reviewing and modifying agent properties](modifying_agent_properties)
-  [Setting agent privileges](setting_agent_privileges)
