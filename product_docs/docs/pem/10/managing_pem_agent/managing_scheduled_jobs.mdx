You can create a PEM scheduled job to perform a set of steps you define in a specified sequence. These steps can contain SQL code or a batch/shell script that you can run on a server that's bound with the agent. You can schedule these jobs to suit your business requirements. For example, you can create a job for taking a backup of a particular database server and schedule it to run on a specific date and time of every month.

To create or manage a PEM scheduled job, use the PEM tree to browse to the PEM agent for which you want to create the job. The tree displays a **Jobs** node, under which currently defined jobs are listed. To add a job, right-click the **Jobs** node and select **Create Job** from the context menu.

Use the tabs on the Create - Agent Job dialog box to define the steps and schedule that make up a PEM scheduled job, as described in the following sections.

## Provide general information about the job

Use the **General** tab to provide general information about a job:

-   Provide a name for the job in the **Name** field.
-   Set the **Enabled** switch to **Yes** to enable a job. Set it to **No** to disable a job.
-   Use the **Comment** field to store notes about the job.

## Define the job steps

Use the **Steps** tab to define and manage the steps that the job performs. Select **Add** (+) to add a step. Then, select the compose icon, located at the left side of the header, to open the Step Definition dialog box.

Use the Step Definition dialog box to define the step:

-   Provide a name for the step in the **Name** field. Steps are performed in alphanumeric order by name.

-   Use the **Enabled** switch to include the step when executing the job (**True**) or to disable the step (**False**).

-   Use the **Kind** switch to indicate if the job step invokes SQL code (**SQL**) or a batch script (**Batch**).

    -   If you select **SQL**, use the **Code** tab to provide SQL code for the step.
    -   If you select **Batch**, use the **Code** tab to provide the batch script to execute during the step.

-   Use the **On error** list to specify the behavior of pgAgent if it encounters an error while executing the step. Select from:

    -   **Fail** &mdash; Stop the job if you encounter an error while processing this step.
    -   **Success** &mdash; Mark the step as completing successfully and continue.
    -   **Ignore** &mdash; Ignore the error and continue.

-   If you selected SQL as your input for the **Kind** switch:

    -   Use the **Server** field to specify the server that's bound with the agent for which you are creating the PEM scheduled job.
    -   Use the **Database** field to specify the database that's associated with the server that you selected.

-   Use the **Comment** field to provide a comment about the step.

-   Use the context-sensitive field on the Step Definition dialog box **Code** tab to provide the SQL code or batch script to execute during the step:

    -   If the step invokes SQL code, provide one or more SQL statements in the **SQL query** field.

    -   If the step invokes a batch script, provide the script in the **Code** field. If you're running on a Windows server, use standard batch file syntax. On a Linux server, you can use any shell script, provided that you specify a suitable interpreter on the first line (such as `#!/bin/sh`). Along with the defined inline code, you can also provide the path of any batch script, shell script, or SQL file on the filesystem.

        -   To invoke a script on a Linux system, you must modify the entry for the `batch_script_user` parameter in the `agent.cfg` file and specify the user who runs the script. You can specify either a nonroot user or root for this parameter. If you don't specify a user or the specified user doesn't exist, then the script doesn't execute. Restart the agent after modifying the file.

        -   To invoke a script on a Windows system, set the registry entry for `AllowBatchJobSteps` to `true` and restart the PEM agent. PEM registry entries are located in `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\EnterpriseDB\PEM\agent`.

After providing all the information required by the step, select **Save**.

## Define the job schedule

Select **Add** (+) to add each step, or select the **Schedules** tab to define the job schedule.

On the **Schedules** tab, select **Add** (+) to add a schedule for the job. Then select the compose icon located at the left side of the header to open the Schedule Definition dialog box.

Use the **Schedules definition** tab to specify the days and times for the job to execute.

-   Provide a name for the schedule in the **Name** field.
-   Use the **Enabled** switch to indicate for pgAgent to use the schedule (**Yes**) or to disable the schedule (**No**).
-   Use the calendar selector in the **Start** field to specify the starting date and time for the schedule.
-   Use the calendar selector in the **End** field to specify the ending date and time for the schedule.
-   Use the **Comment** field to provide a comment about the schedule.

Select the **Repeat** tab to define the days when the schedule executes in a cron-style format. The job executes on each date or time element selected on the **Repeat** tab.

In each field, select a value to add it to the list of selected values for the field. To clear the values from a field, select the X located at the right-side of the field.

-   Use the fields in the **Days** box to specify the days when the job executes:
    -   Use the **Week Days** field to select the days when the job executes.
    -   Use the **Month Days** field to select the numeric days when the job executes. Select **Last Day** to perform the job on the last day of the month, regardless of the date.
    -   Use the **Months** field to select the months when the job executes.
-   Use the fields in the **Times** box to specify the times when the job executes in hours and minutes.

Select the **Exceptions** tab to specify any days when you don't want the schedule to execute. For example, you might not want to run jobs on holidays.

Select **Add** (+) to add a row to the exception table. Then:

-   In the **Date** column, open a calendar selector and select a date when you don't want the job to execute. Specify ****&lt;Any>**** to indicate that you don't want the job to execute on any day at the time selected.
-   In the **Time** column, open a time selector and specify a time when you don't want the job to execute. Specify ****&lt;Any>**** to indicate that you don't want the job to execute at any time on the day selected.

## Configure the email notifications

Select the **Notifications** tab to configure the email notification settings on job level:

-   Use the **Send the notifications** field to specify when you want to send the email notifications.
-   Use the **Email group** field to specify the email group to send the email notification to.

When you finish defining the schedule, you can use the **SQL** tab to review the code that creates or modifies your job.

Select **Save** to save the job definition.

After you save a job, the job is listed under the **Jobs** node of the PEM tree of the server on which it was defined. The **Properties** tab in the PEM console displays a high-level overview of the selected job, and the **Statistics** tab shows the details of each run of the job. To modify an existing job or to review detailed information about a job, right-click a job name, and select **Properties** from the context menu.
