The PEM Agent Properties dialog box provides information about the PEM agent from which the dialog box was opened. To open the dialog box, right-click an agent name in the PEM client tree and select **Properties** from the context menu.

Use the PEM Agent Properties dialog box to review or modify information about the PEM agent:

-   The **Description** field displays a modifiable description of the PEM agent. This description is displayed in the tree of the PEM client.

-   You can use groups to organize your servers and agents in the PEM client tree. Use the **Group** list to select the group in which the agent is displayed.

-   Use the **Team** field to specify the name of the group role that can access servers monitored by the agent. The servers monitored by this agent are visible in the PEM client tree to connected team members. This is a convenience feature. The **Team** field doesn't provide true isolation. Don't use it for security purposes.

-   The **Heartbeat interval** fields display the length of time that elapses between reports from the PEM agent to the PEM server. Use the selectors next to the **Minutes** or **Seconds** fields to modify the interval.

    Use the **Job Notifications** tab to configure the email notification settings on agent level:

    -   Use the **Override default configuration?** switch to specify if you want the agent level job notification settings to override the default job notification settings. Select **Yes** to enable the rest of the settings on this dialog box to define when and to whom to send the job notifications. 
    -   Use the **Email on job completion?** switch to specify whether to send the job notification when the job completes successfully.
    -   Use the **Email on a job failure?** switch to specify whether to send the job notification when the job fails.
    -   Use the **Email group** field to specify the email group to send the job notification to.

    The **Agent Configurations** tab displays all the current configurations and capabilities of an agent.

    -   The **Parameter** column displays a list of parameters.
    -   The **Value** column displays the current value of the corresponding parameter.
    -   The **Category** column displays the category of the corresponding parameter. It can be either **configuration** or **capability**.
