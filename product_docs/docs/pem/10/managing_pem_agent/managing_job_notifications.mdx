In the PEM console, you can configure the settings for sending the SMTP trap on success or failure of a system-generated job listed under scheduled tasks or a custom agent job. You can configure these email notification settings at the following three levels to send email notifications to the specified user group. These levels are shown in order of precedence.

-   Job level
-   Agent level
-   PEM server level (default)

## Configuring job notifications at job level

You can configure email notification settings at the job level only for a custom agent job in one of the following ways:

-   For a new agent job, you can configure the email notification settings in the **Notification** tab of the Create Agent Job wizard while creating the job.
-   For an existing custom job, you can edit the properties of the job and configure the notification settings.

Use the **Notifications** tab to configure the email notification settings at the job level:

-   Use the **Send the notifications** field to specify when you want to send the email notifications.
-   Use the **Email group** field to specify the email group to send the email notification to.

## Configuring job notifications at agent level

Select the agent in the tree view, right-click, and select **Properties**. In the Properties dialog box, select the **Job Notifications** tab.

Use the Job notifications tab to configure the email notification settings at the agent level:

-   Use the **Override default configuration?** switch to specify if you want the agent level job notification settings to override the default job notification settings. Select **Yes** to enable the rest of the settings on this dialog box to define when and to whom to send the job notifications. 
-   Use the **Email on job completion?** switch to specify whether to send the job notification when the job completes successfully.
-   Use the **Email on a job failure?** switch to specify whether to send the job notification when the job fails.
-   Use the **Email group** field to specify the email group to send the job notification to.

## Configuring job notifications at server level

You can use the Server Configuration dialog box to provide information about your email notification configuration at the PEM server level. To open the Server Configuration dialog box, select **Management > Server Configuration**.

Four server configuration parameters specify information about your job notification preferences at PEM server level:

-   Use the **job_failure_notification** switch to specify if you want to send an email notification after each job failure.
-   Use the **job_notification_email_group** parameter to specify the email group to send the email notification to.
-   Use the **job_retention_time parameter** to specify the number of days to retain nonrecurring scheduled tasks in the system.
-   Use the **job_status_change_notification** switch to specify if you want to send an email notification after each job status change, that is, failure, success, or interrupted.
