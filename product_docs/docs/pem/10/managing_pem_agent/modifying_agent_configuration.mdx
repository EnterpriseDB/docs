navTitle: "Modifying agent configuration"
---

A number of configurable parameters control the behavior of the PEM agent. On Linux, these are stored in a configuration file. On Windows they're stored as registry keys.

Most agent configuration is managed automatically. We recommend against manually modifying any of these configuration parameters unless specifically directed to do so.

!!! Note
    If you add, remove, or modify any of the parameters, you must restart the agent to apply the changes.

## Contents of the configuration file

On Linux systems, PEM configuration options are stored in the `agent.cfg` file, located in `/usr/edb/pem/agent/etc`. The `agent.cfg` file contains the entries shown in the following table.

| Parameter name          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Default value                                                                                                 |

## About alert threads

The number of alert threads spawned by an agent is determined by the `alert_threads` or `AlertThreads` parameter. In general, we recommend setting this parameter to 1 on the agent that resides on the PEM server and 0 for all other agents. However, on PEM server instances with very large numbers of alerts (caused by many monitored servers, many enabled alerts, or high alert frequency), it may be necessary to increase this parameter if alerts are not being evaluated at the configured frequency. In this situation, we recommend setting this parameter to around 8 on the agent that resides on the PEM server and 0 for all other agents and tuning up or down accordingly.

When tuning this parameter, note that any agent can process any alert, so in general it is unnecessary to have a non-zero number of alert threads on more than one agent. The capacity of the PEM instance to process alerts is determined by the total number of alert thread across all agents. Increasing the number of threads on a specific agent does not give any additional performance for alerts pertaining to servers monitored by that agent.

Each alert thread opens a connection to the PEM server backend, so allocating more threads than necessary does result in additional memory and CPU usage on the PEM server.
