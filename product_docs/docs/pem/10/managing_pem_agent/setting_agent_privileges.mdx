navTitle: "Setting agent privileges"
---

By default, the PEM agent is installed with root privileges for the operating system host and superuser privileges for the database server. These privileges allow the PEM agent to invoke unrestricted probes on the monitored host and database server about system usage, retrieving and returning the information to the PEM server.

## Root user versus non-root user

PEM functionality lessens as the privileges of the PEM agent decrease. For complete functionality, run the PEM agent as root. 
The table below gives a high-level summary of the effects of limiting privileges. 
Further details are provided in the subsequent sections.

| Feature name                 | Works with root user     | Works with non-root user                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Works with remote PEM agent                                                                                                                                                                   |

## Functionality affected by limiting operating system privileges

If you run the PEM agent as a non-root user, the level of functionality will depend on what exactly permissions the agent user has.
The following sections explain what operations are impacted by OS user permissions and what permissions are required for normal operation.

### Probes

|                 Probe                           | Operating system |                                                 PEM functionality affected                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Session Information                             | Linux/Windows    | The probe will be missing the following ‘per-process’ columns if the agent user is not either root or the same user as Postgres: `memory_usage_mb`, `swap_usage_mb`, `cpu_usage`, `io_read_bytes`, `io_write_bytes`. |
| Patroni Node Status                             | Linux/Windows    | Requires permission to execute `patronictl`. No data will be returned otherwise. |
| Patroni Cluster Status                          | Linux/Windows    | Requires permission to execute `patronictl`. No data will be returned otherwise. |
| PG HBA Conf                                     | Linux/Windows    | Requires permission to read `pg_hba.conf`. No data will be returned otherwise. |
| Data and Log File Analysis                      | Linux/Windows    | Requires permission to read PGDATA. No data will be returned otherwise. |
| WAL Archive Status                              | Linux/Windows    | Requires read access to the WAL directory. No data will be returned otherwise. |
| Failover Manager Node Status                    | Linux/Windows    | Requires permission to execute `efm`. No data will be returned otherwise. |
| Failover Manager Cluster Info                   | Linux/Windows    | Requires permission to execute `efm`. No data will be returned otherwise. |

### Restarting services

The Audit Log Manager and Server Log Manager require the PEM agent user to restart the Postgres service for changes to take effect.
If the agent user does not have sufficient privileges to restart services (typically, this requires root access), these features will not be functional.

### Batch/shell tasks

On Windows, the PEM Agent cannot run batch tasks unless the agent user has administrative privileges.

On Linux, the PEM Agent can only run shell tasks if the agent user can become the `batch_script_user` specified in `agent.cfg`.
This is always true for the root user and the `batch_script_user`.

## Functionality affected by limiting database privileges

If the PEM agent connects to the monitored database using a non-superuser account, the available functionality will be limited based on the specific privileges granted to that user. 
The following sections describe which PEM operations are affected by Postgres user permissions and what privileges are required for standard monitoring functionality.

The PEM agent reads data from the pg_catalog schema for most SQL-based probes. In general, assigning the pg_monitor role to the agent user is sufficient. However, certain catalog functions and probes may require additional privileges beyond pg_monitor.

Additionally, the agent user must be able to connect to all target databases where probes need to run. 
If the agent cannot connect to a database, no database-level probes will be executed on that instance. Only server-level metrics—such as those collected from `pg_stat_database`—will be available in such cases.

The following table lists probes that require permissions in addition to `pg_monitor`.

| Probe                          | Operating system | Additional permissions required                                                                                                                                                                         |
|--------------------------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| All PGD probes                 | Linux/Windows    | Require `SELECT` permission on tables and views, and `EXECUTE` permission on functions, in the `bdr` schema of the replicated database.                                                                 |
| Number of WAL Files            | Linux/Windows    | Requires `EXECUTE` on `pg_ls_dir()`.                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Streaming Replication Lag Time | Linux/Windows    | Requires the ability to execute `pg_last_xlog_receive_location()`, `pg_last_xlog_replay_location()`, and `pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp()`. This can be provided by granting the `pg_wal_monitor` role. |
| Streaming Replication          | Linux/Windows    | Requires the ability to execute `pg_xlogfile_name_offset()` and `pg_xlog_location_diff()`. This can be provided by granting the `pg_wal_monitor` role.                                                  |
| System Waits & Session Waits   | Linux/Windows    | Require `SELECT` permission on the `system_waits` and `session_waits` views respectively.                                                                                                               |

| User Information               | Linux/Windows    | Requires `SELECT` on `pg_user`.                                                                                                                                                                         |

## Error handling

If the probe is querying the operating system without enough privileges, the probe might return a `permission denied` error. If the probe is querying the database without enough privileges, the probe might return a `permission denied` error or display the returned data in a PEM chart or graph as an empty value.

When a probe fails, an entry is written to the log file that contains the name of the probe, the reason the probe failed, and a hint that helps you resolve the problem.

You can view probe-related errors that occurred on the server in the Probe Log dashboard or review error messages in the PEM worker log files. On Linux, the default location of the log file is:

 `/var/log/pem/worker.log`

On Windows, log information is available on the Event Viewer.
