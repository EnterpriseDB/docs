navTitle: "Setting agent privileges"
---

By default, the PEM agent is installed with root privileges for the operating system host and superuser privileges for the database server. These privileges allow the PEM agent to invoke unrestricted probes on the monitored host and database server about system usage, retrieving and returning the information to the PEM server.

## Root user versus non-root user

PEM functionality lessens as the privileges of the PEM agent decrease. For complete functionality, run the PEM agent as root. 
The table below gives a high-level summary of the effects of limniting priveleges. 
Further detail is provided in the subsequent sections.

## Functionality affected by limiting operating system privileges

If you run the PEM agent as a non-root user, the level of functionality will depend on what exactly permissions the agent user has.
The following sections explain what operations are impacted by OS user permissions and what permissions are required for normal operation.

### Probes

|                 Probe                           | Operating system |                                                 PEM functionality affected                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Session Information                             | Linux/Windows    | The probe will be missing the following ‘per-process’ columns if the agent user is not either root or the same user as Postgres: `memory_usage_mb`, `swap_usage_mb`, `cpu_usage`, `io_read_bytes`, `io_write_bytes`. |
| Patroni Node Status                             | Linux/Windows    | Requires permission to execute `patronictl`. No data will be returned otherwise. |
| Patroni Cluster Status                          | Linux/Windows    | Requires permission to execute `patronictl`. No data will be returned otherwise. |
| PG HBA Conf                                     | Linux/Windows    | Requires permission to read `pg_hba.conf`. No data will be returned otherwise. |
| Data and Log File Analysis                      | Linux/Windows    | Requires permission to read PGDATA. No data will be returned otherwise. |
| WAL Archive Status                              | Linux/Windows    | Requires read access to the WAL directory. No data will be returned otherwise. |
| Failover Manager Node Status                    | Linux/Windows    | Requires permission to execute `efm`. No data will be returned otherwise. |
| Failover Manager Cluster Info                   | Linux/Windows    | Requires permission to execute `efm`. No data will be returned otherwise. |

### Restarting services

The Audit Log Manager and Server Log Manager require the PEM agent user to restart the Postgres service to apply changes.
If the user does not have sufficient privileges (typically only the root user may restart services) these features will not be useable.

### Batch/shell tasks

On Windows, the PEM Agent cannot run batch tasks unless it the agent user has administrative privileges.

On Linux, the PEM Agent can only run shell tasks if the agent user can become the `batch_script_user` specified in `agent.cfg`.
This is always true of the root user, and of the `batch_script_user` itself.

## Functionality affected by limiting database privileges

If you restrict the database privileges of the PEM agent, the following PEM functionality might be affected:

|           Probe            | Operating system |                             PEM functionality affected                             |
| -------------------------- | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Audit Log Collection       | Linux/Windows    | PEM receives empty data from the PEM database.                                     |
| Server Log Collection      | Linux/Windows    | PEM can't collect server log information.                                          |
| Database Statistics        | Linux/Windows    | The Database/Server Analysis dashboards contain incomplete information.            |
| Session Waits/System Waits | Linux/Windows    | The Session/System Waits dashboards contain incomplete information.                |
| Locks Information          | Linux/Windows    | The Database/Server Analysis dashboards contain incomplete information.            |
| Streaming Replication      | Linux/Windows    | The Streaming Replication dashboard doesn't display information.                   |
| Slony Replication          | Linux/Windows    | Slony-related charts on the Database Analysis dashboard don't display information. |
| Tablespace Size            | Linux/Windows    | The Server Analysis dashboard doesn't display complete information.                |
| xDB Replication            | Linux/Windows    | PEM can't send xDB alerts and traps.                                               |

## Error handling

If the probe is querying the operating system without enough privileges, the probe might return a `permission denied` error. If the probe is querying the database without enough privileges, the probe might return a `permission denied` error or display the returned data in a PEM chart or graph as an empty value.

When a probe fails, an entry is written to the log file that contains the name of the probe, the reason the probe failed, and a hint that helps you resolve the problem.

You can view probe-related errors that occurred on the server in the Probe Log dashboard or review error messages in the PEM worker log files. On Linux, the default location of the log file is:

 `/var/log/pem/worker.log`

On Windows, log information is available on the Event Viewer.
