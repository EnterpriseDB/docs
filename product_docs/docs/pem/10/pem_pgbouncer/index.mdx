To limit connections between the PEM agent and server on non-Windows systems, you can implement PgBouncer as a connection pooler. The process involves three main phases:

- **[Phase 1: Preparing the PEM database server](preparing_the_pem_database_server)** 

    It provides the steps to prepare the PEM database server to use with PgBouncer.

- **[Phase 2: Configuring PgBouncer](configuring_pgBouncer)** 

    It provides detailed information about configuring PgBouncer to allow it to work with the PEM database server.

- **[Phase 3: Configuring the PEM agent](configuring_the_pem_agent)** 

    It provides detailed information about configuring a PEM agent to connect to PgBouncer.

For detailed information about using the PEM web interface, see [Accessing the web interface](../pem_web_interface.mdx).
