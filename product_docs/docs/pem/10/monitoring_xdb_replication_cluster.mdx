Before configuring PEM to retrieve statistics from an EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database that's part of an xDB replication scenario, you must manually install and configure xDB replication. For more information about xDB replication solutions and documentation, see [Multi-master replication operation](/eprs/latest/06_mmr_operation/).

The PEM xDB Replication probe monitors lag data for clusters that use xDB multi-primary or single-primary replication that have an EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL publication database. If you configured replication between other proprietary database hosts (that is, Oracle or SQL Server) and EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL, the probe can't return lag information.

By default, the xDB Replication probe is disabled. To enable the xDB Replication probe:
1.  Right-click the name of the server and select **Connect** from the context menu. 
1.  If prompted, provide authentication information. 
1.  After connecting, expand the server node of the tree and select the name of the replicated database. 
1.  Select **Management > Manage Probes**.

Use the **Manage Probes** tab to configure the xDB Replication probe:

-   Set **Default** to **No** to modify the minutes and seconds between probe executions.
-   Use the **Enabled?** slider to enable the xDB Replication probe.
-   Set **Default** slider in the **Data Retention** field to **No** to modify the number of days for PEM to store the information retrieved by the probe.

After enabling the probe, you can use the metrics returned to create custom charts and dashboards in the PEM client.
