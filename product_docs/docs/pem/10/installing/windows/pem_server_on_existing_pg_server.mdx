You can use an existing Postgres server (version 13 or later) to host the PEM server and the `pem` database. Postgres installers and prerequisite software extensions are freely available on the [EnterpriseDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads).

You can configure an existing Postgres server for a PEM server installation.

!!! Note
    These instructions are guidelines. the actual steps needed to configure your Postgres installation depend on the configuration of your Postgres server.


## Graphical installation

Invoke the PEM server installer. Assume administrator privileges and navigate to the directory that contains the installer. Then, invoke the installer:

```shell
pem_server-10.<x>.<x>-<x>-<platform>
```

Where `<x>` is the major and minor versions of PEM, and `<platform>` is the platform.

Then, begin the installation:

1.  The installer displays a Welcome screen. Select **Next**.

1.  Review the license agreement before selecting the appropriate radio button and accepting the agreement. Select **Next**.

1.  Use the Installation Directory dialog box to specify the location of the PEM server and access the Advanced Options dialog box:

    -   Use the **Installation Directory** field to open a browser dialog and select the directory to install the PEM server in.
    -   If you're installing the PEM server on an existing server, select **Show advanced options** to include the Advanced Options dialog box in the installation process.
    - Select **Next**.

1.  Use the Advanced Options dialog box to specify an installation type. Select:

    -   **Web Services and Database** if both the Postgres server and the PEM-HTTPD server will reside on the current host. This option is valid if you're using an existing Postgres server to host the PEM server or using the PEM server installer to install the Postgres server where the PEM server will reside.

        If you select **Web Services and Database**, the PEM server installer checks the current host for a PEM-HTTPD installation and upgrades or installs PEM-HTTPD if necessary.

    -   **Web Services** if only the PEM-HTTPD server will reside on the current host. See [Installing web services](pem_server_and_httpd_on_diff_host/#installing-web-services) for more information about invoking this option.

    -   **Database** if you're installing only the PEM server (and creating the `pem` backend database) on the current host. This option is valid if you're using an existing Postgres server to host the PEM server or using the PEM server installer to install the PostgreSQL server where PEM will reside.

    After selecting an installation option, select **Next**.

1.  Use the list on the Database Server Selection dialog box to select a backend database for the PEM server:

    -   Select the name of a Postgres server on the current host that was installed using a Postgres one-click installer or EDB Postgres Advanced Server installer.
    -   Select **PostgreSQL x (Packaged)** to install and use the PostgreSQL server that's packaged with the PEM server installer, where `x` is the version of the PostgreSQL database server.
    -   Select **Other Database Server** to to use a Postgres database that was installed from a source other than an EnterpriseDB installer (such as from an rpm or built from source).

    !!! Note
        The selected database server must include an installation of the `sslutils` contrib module and a registered service (on Windows).

        For more information, see [Preparing the Postgres server](#preparing-the-postgres-server).

    If you selected **Web Services and Database** on the Advanced Options dialog box, the installation wizard checks the current host for an existing PEM-HTTPD installation and upgrades or installs the service as needed.

    If you selected **Database** on the Advanced Options dialog box, the Database Server Installation Details dialog box opens.

1.  Use the fields on the Database Server Installation Details dialog box to describe the connection to the Postgres server that will host the PEM server:

    -   Enter the name of a database superuser in the **User** field.
    -   Enter the password associated with the superuser in the **Password** field.

    Select **Next**.

1.  Provide the administrator password for the PEM agent service to run under. Select **Next**.

1.  Use the Network Details dialog box to specify the CIDR-style network address for the PEM agents to connect to the server (the `client-side` address). The specified address is added to the server's `pg_hba.conf file.`

    You can specify more network addresses by manually adding entries to the `pg_hba.conf` file on the PostgreSQL server. Use the first entry as a template.

    After you add the network address, select **Next**.

    The PEM server installer installs a PEM agent to the host where the server resides to monitor the server and provide alert processing and garbage collection services. A certificate is also installed in the location specified in the **Agent certificate path** field.

1.  You can enter an alternate description or an alternate agent certificate path for the PEM agent or accept the defaults. Select **Next**.

1. You must enter your organization details to be used in SSL certificates generated by PEM.

1.  The wizard is now ready to install the PEM server. Select **Next** to continue with the installation.

    During the installation process, the installer copies files to the system and sets up the PEM server's backend database. A confirmation indicates that the `pem` database was created and configured.

1.  Select **OK**.

If you're using a PEM-HTTPD service that resides on a separate host, you must:

-   Modify the `pg_hba.conf` file on the Postgres server host to allow connections between the hosts.
-   Invoke the PEM server installer on the host of the PEM-HTTPD server. See [Installing Web Services](pem_server_and_httpd_on_diff_host/#installing-web-services) for more information about installing PEM-HTTPD.

## Invoking the server installer from the command line

The command line options of the PEM server and PEM agent installers offer functionality in situations where a graphical installation might not work because of limited resources or system configuration. You can:

-   Include the `--mode unattended` option when invoking the installer to perform an installation without user input.

Not all command line options are suitable for all platforms. For a complete reference guide to the command line options, use the `--help` option when you invoke the installer.

## Invoking the PEM server installer in unattended mode

You can perform an unattended PEM server installation by providing installation preferences on the command line when invoking the installer. The system on which you're installing the PEM server must have internet access.

You must have administrator privileges to install the PEM server. Before invoking the PEM server installer, you must install the following dependencies:

-   PostgreSQL
-   pem-httpd
-   Language Pack

You can use the PEM server installer to satisfy the dependencies of the PEM server. Navigate to the location of the installer, and use the following command to extract the dependencies:

```shell
pem-server-10.<x>.<x>-windows-x64.exe --extract-dependents C:\
```

In this example, the files are extracted to the `C:\` directory. After extracting the files, you must install each program. Navigate to the directory that contains the files (in this example, `C:\)`, and enter:

```shell
edb-languagepack-<version>-windows-x64.exe --mode unattended
pem-httpd-<version>-windows-x64.exe --mode unattended
postgresql-<version>-windows-x64.exe --mode unattended
```

Then, you can invoke the PEM server installer:

```shell
pem-server-10.<x>.<x>-windows-x64.exe --mode unattended
--existing-user <registered_edb_user> --existing-password
<edb_user_password> --pgport <port> --pguser postgres
--agent_description pem-agent --systempassword <windows_password>
--agent-crt-path C:\edb
--certi_subject_country 
--certi_subject_state US 
--certi_subject_city MyCity 
--certi_subject_org MyOrg
--certi_subject_org_unit MyUnit
--certi_subject_common_name MyName
--certi_subject_email admin@myorg.domain 

```

Where:

-   `registered_edb_user` specifies the name of a registered EnterpriseDB user. To register, visit the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user/register).
-   `edb_user_password` specifies the password associated with the EDB user account.
-   `port` specifies the port used by the backing PostgreSQL database. By default, the PostgreSQL database uses port 5432.
-   `cidr_address_range` specifies the address range to add to the `pg_hba.conf` file of the PEM server's backing database to allow connections from the agents for the server to monitor. You can specify a network range (for example, 192.168.2.0/24) to provide server access to agents that reside on the same network.
-   `windows_password` specifies the password associated with the Windows administrator's account.

!!! Note
    When invoked in unattended mode, the PostgreSQL installer creates a user named `postgres` with a password of `postgres`.
