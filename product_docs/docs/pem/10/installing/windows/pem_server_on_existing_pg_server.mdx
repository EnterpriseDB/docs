You can use an existing Postgres server (version 11 or later) to host the PEM server and the `pem` database. Postgres installers and prerequisite software extensions are freely available on the [EnterpriseDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads).

You can configure an existing Postgres server for a PEM server installation.

!!! Note
    These instructions are guidelines. the actual steps needed to configure your Postgres installation depend on the configuration of your Postgres server.

The following versions of Postgres are preconfigured to contain the `sslutils` extension and a service script. No additional preparation is required to use the following Postgres versions as a PEM backend database server:

-   PostgreSQL 11 or later (as bundled with the PEM Server installer)
-   EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11 or later

## Preparing the Postgres server

Before installing the PEM server on an existing Postgres server, you must:

-   Ensure that the Postgres server contains an installation of the `sslutils` extension. For more information, see [Installing the sslutils Extension](#installing-the-sslutils-extension).
-   Register the server with the Windows service manager. For more information, see [Registering the service](#registering-the-service).

After preparing the server, you can use the PEM server installer to install PEM on the existing Postgres server.

## Installing the sslutils extension

The Postgres server where the PEM server will reside must contain the `sslutils` extension. The `sslutils` package is freely available for download from the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/modified-gpl-source-code).

When the web page opens, select the link for the `SRC- SSL Utils 1.3` package. When the download completes, extract the file, and copy it into the Postgres installation directory.

!!! Note 
    You don't need to manually add the `sslutils` extension when using the following Postgres installations:

-   PostgreSQL 10 or later (as distributed with the PEM server installer)
-   Advanced Server 10 or later

Build `sslutils` with the same compiler that you used to compile the backend Postgres installation. If you're using a backend Postgres database that was installed on a Windows platform using a PostgreSQL one-click installer (from EnterpriseDB) or an EDB Postgres Advanced Server installer, you must use Visual Studio to build `sslutils`.

While specific details of the installation process vary by platform and compiler, the basic steps are the same. You must:

1.  Copy the `sslutils` package to the Postgres installation directory.

2.  Open the command line of the appropriate compiler, and navigate to the `sslutils` directory.

3.  Use the following commands to build `sslutils`:

    ```sql
    SET USE_PGXS=1

    SET GETTEXTPATH=<path_to_gettext>

    SET OPENSSLPATH=<path_to_openssl>

    SET PGPATH=<path_to_pg_installation_dir>

    SET ARCH=x86

    REM Set ARCH x64 for 64 bit

    msbuild sslutils.proj /p:Configuration=Release
    ```

    Where:

    `path_to_gettext` specifies the location of the `GETTEXT` library and header files.

    `path_to_openssl` specifies the location of the `openssl` library and header files.

    `path_to_pg_installation_dir` specifies the location of the Postgres installation.

4.  Copy the compiled `sslutils` files to the appropriate directory for your installation. The `sslutils` directory contains the following files:

    ```shell
    sslutils--1.3.sql

    sslutils--unpackaged--1.3.sql

    sslutils--pemagent.sql.in

    sslutils.dll
    ```

    Copy the `.dll` libraries and `.sql` files into place:

    ```sql
    COPY sslutils*.sql* "%PGPATH%\share\extension\"

    COPY sslutils.dll "%PGPATH%\lib\"
    ```

## Registering the service

When you install a PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server database using an installer from EnterpriseDB, the installer registers the service for you.

If you're using Windows to host the PEM backend database, you must register the name of the Postgres server with the Windows service manager. If you're using a Postgres server that was created using an EnterpriseDB installer, the service is registered automatically. If you are manually building the installation, you can use the `register` clause of the Postgres `pg_ctl` command to register the service:

```shell
pg_ctl register [-N <service_name>] [-U <user_name>]
 | [-P <password>] [-D <data_directory>]
```

Where:

-  `service name` specifies the name of the Postgres cluster.
-  `user_name` specifies the name of an operating system user with sufficient privileges to access the Postgres installation directory and start the Postgres service.
-  `password` specifies the operating system password associated with the user.
-  `data_directory` specifies the location of the Postgres data directory.

For more information about using the `pg_ctl` command and the available command options, see the [Postgres core documentation](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-pg-ctl.html).

## Invoking the PEM server installer

After preparing the existing Postgres server, invoke the PEM server installer. Assume administrator privileges and navigate to the directory that contains the installer. Then, invoke the installer:

```shell
pem_server-7.<x>.<x>-<x>-<platform>
```

Where `<x>` is the major and minor versions of PEM, and `<platform>` is the platform.

Then, begin the installation:

1.  The installer displays a Welcome screen. Select **Next**.

1.  Review the license agreement before selecting the appropriate radio button and accepting the agreement. Select **Next**.

1.  Use the Installation Directory dialog box to specify the location of the PEM server and access the Advanced Options dialog box:

    -   Use the **Installation Directory** field to open a browser dialog and select the directory to install the PEM server in.
    -   If you're installing the PEM server on an existing server, select **Show advanced options** to include the Advanced Options dialog box in the installation process.
    - Select **Next**.

1.  Use the Advanced Options dialog box to specify an installation type. Select:

    -   **Web Services and Database** if both the Postgres server and the PEM-HTTPD server will reside on the current host. This option is valid if you're using an existing Postgres server to host the PEM server or using the PEM server installer to install the Postgres server where the PEM server will reside.

        If you select **Web Services and Database**, the PEM server installer checks the current host for a PEM-HTTPD installation and upgrades or installs PEM-HTTPD if necessary.

    -   **Web Services** if only the PEM-HTTPD server will reside on the current host. See [Installing web services](pem_server_and_httpd_on_diff_host/#installing-web-services) for more information about invoking this option.

    -   **Database** if you're installing only the PEM server (and creating the `pem` backend database) on the current host. This option is valid if you're using an existing Postgres server to host the PEM server or using the PEM server installer to install the PostgreSQL server where PEM will reside.

    After selecting an installation option, select **Next**.

1.  Use the list on the Database Server Selection dialog box to select a backend database for the PEM server:

    -   Select the name of a Postgres server on the current host that was installed using a Postgres one-click installer or EDB Postgres Advanced Server installer.
    -   Select **PostgreSQL x (Packaged)** to install and use the PostgreSQL server that's packaged with the PEM server installer, where `x` is the version of the PostgreSQL database server.
    -   Select **Other Database Server** to to use a Postgres database that was installed from a source other than an EnterpriseDB installer (such as from an rpm or built from source).

    !!! Note
        The selected database server must include an installation of the `sslutils` contrib module and a registered service (on Windows).

        For more information, see [Preparing the Postgres server](#preparing-the-postgres-server).

    If you selected **Web Services and Database** on the Advanced Options dialog box, the installation wizard checks the current host for an existing PEM-HTTPD installation and upgrades or installs the service as needed.

    If you selected **Database** on the Advanced Options dialog box, the Database Server Installation Details dialog box opens.

1.  Use the fields on the Database Server Installation Details dialog box to describe the connection to the Postgres server that will host the PEM server:

    -   Enter the name of a database superuser in the **User** field.
    -   Enter the password associated with the superuser in the **Password** field.

    Select **Next**.

1.  Provide the administrator password for the PEM agent service to run under. Select **Next**.

1.  Use the Network Details dialog box to specify the CIDR-style network address for the PEM agents to connect to the server (the `client-side` address). The specified address is added to the server's `pg_hba.conf file.`

    You can specify more network addresses by manually adding entries to the `pg_hba.conf` file on the PostgreSQL server. Use the first entry as a template.

    After you add the network address, select **Next**.

    The PEM server installer installs a PEM agent to the host where the server resides to monitor the server and provide alert processing and garbage collection services. A certificate is also installed in the location specified in the **Agent certificate path** field.

1.  You can enter an alternate description or an alternate agent certificate path for the PEM agent or accept the defaults. Select **Next**.

1.  The wizard is now ready to install the PEM server. Select **Next** to continue with the installation.

    During the installation process, the installer copies files to the system and sets up the PEM server's backend database. A confirmation indicates that the `pem` database was created and configured.

1.  Select **OK**.

If you're using a PEM-HTTPD service that resides on a separate host, you must:

-   Modify the `pg_hba.conf` file on the Postgres server host to allow connections between the hosts.
-   Invoke the PEM server installer on the host of the PEM-HTTPD server. See [Installing Web Services](pem_server_and_httpd_on_diff_host/#installing-web-services) for more information about installing PEM-HTTPD.

## Invoking the server installer from the command line

The command line options of the PEM server and PEM agent installers offer functionality in situations where a graphical installation might not work because of limited resources or system configuration. You can:

-   Include the `--mode unattended` option when invoking the installer to perform an installation without user input.

Not all command line options are suitable for all platforms. For a complete reference guide to the command line options, use the `--help` option when you invoke the installer.

## Invoking the PEM server installer in unattended mode

You can perform an unattended PEM server installation by providing installation preferences on the command line when invoking the installer. The system on which you're installing the PEM server must have internet access.

You must have administrator privileges to install the PEM server. Before invoking the PEM server installer, you must install the following dependencies:

-   PostgreSQL
-   pem-httpd
-   Language Pack

You can use the PEM server installer to satisfy the dependencies of the PEM server. Navigate to the location of the installer, and use the following command to extract the dependencies:

```shell
pem-server-7.<x>.<x>-windows-x64.exe --extract-dependents C:\
```

In this example, the files are extracted to the `C:\` directory. After extracting the files, you must install each program. Navigate to the directory that contains the files (in this example, `C:\)`, and enter:

```shell
edb-languagepack-<version>-windows-x64.exe --mode unattended
pem-httpd-<version>-windows-x64.exe --mode unattended
postgresql-<version>-windows-x64.exe --mode unattended
```

Then, you can invoke the PEM server installer:

```shell
pem-server-7.<x>.<x>-windows-x64.exe --mode unattended
--existing-user <registered_edb_user> --existing-password
<edb_user_password> --pgport <port> --pguser postgres
--agent_description pem-agent --systempassword <windows_password>
--agent-crt-path C:\edb``
```

Where:

-   `registered_edb_user` specifies the name of a registered EnterpriseDB user. To register, visit the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user/register).
-   `edb_user_password` specifies the password associated with the EDB user account.
-   `port` specifies the port used by the backing PostgreSQL database. By default, the PostgreSQL database uses port 5432.
-   `cidr_address_range` specifies the address range to add to the `pg_hba.conf` file of the PEM server's backing database to allow connections from the agents for the server to monitor. You can specify a network range (for example, 192.168.2.0/24) to provide server access to agents that reside on the same network.
-   `windows_password` specifies the password associated with the Windows administrator's account.

!!! Note
    When invoked in unattended mode, the PostgreSQL installer creates a user named `postgres` with a password of `postgres`.
