Before deploying PEM in an HA pattern, please familiarize yourself with the high-level guidance in  [High Availability Patterns for PEM Deployment](/pem/latest/considerations/ha_pem.mdx).

The following pages provide detailed instructions for some example HA PEM architectures. They are not intended to be an exhaustive guide to all possible patterns.

- [Deploying HA PEM with colocated web application and backend using EDB Failover Manager and Virtual IPs](setup_ha_using_efm.mdx)
- [Deploying HA PEM with separate web application and backend using EDB Failover Manager and Virtual IPs](efm_s1.mdx)
- [Deploying HA PEM with Patroni](patroni.mdx)

In addition, the following guides to specific elements of HA PEM deployment are provided:
