After defining a server connection, use the `Connect to Server` dialog to authenticate with a server and access the objects stored on the server. To access the dialog, right click on the server name in the PEM client tree control, and select `Connect Server` from the context menu.

If prompted, provide authentication information for the selected server:

-   Use the `Password` field to provide the user's password associated with the defined server.
-   Select the box next to `Save Password` to instruct the server to save the password for future connections. If you save the password, you are not prompted while reconnecting to the database server with this server definition.

The browser displays a message in a green status bar in the lower right corner when the server connects successfully.

If you receive an error message while attempting a connection, verify that your network is allowing PEM and the host of the database server to communicate. For detailed information about a specific error message, see the [Troubleshooting](/pem/latest/troubleshooting/) help page.

To review or modify connection details, right-click on the name of the server, and select `Properties...` from the context menu.

## Disconnecting from a server

To disconnect from a server, right-click on the server name in the `Browser` tree control and select Disconnect Server from the context menu. A popup will ask you to confirm that you wish to disconnect the selected server.
