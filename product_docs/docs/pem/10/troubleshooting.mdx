##  Known installation and configuration issues

### Conflict with existing mod_wsgi

If you have a conflicting version of mod_wsgi on your system, the following error appears while installing the PEM server on RHEL, Rocky, Alma or Oracle Linux:

```text
[root@etpgxlt firstuser]# dnf install edb-pem
Updating Subscription Management repositories.
Last metadata expiration check: 0:01:33 ago on Wed 30 Mar 2022 01:28:16 AM EDT.
Error: 
 Problem: problem with installed package python3-mod_wsgi-4.6.4-4.el8.s390x
  - package python39-mod_wsgi-4.7.1-4.module+el8.4.0+9822+20bf1249.s390x conflicts with python3-mod_wsgi provided by python3-mod_wsgi-4.6.4-4.el8.s390x

  - package edb-pem-server-8.4.0-7.rhel8.s390x requires python39-mod_wsgi >= 4.7, but none of the providers can be installed
  - package edb-pem-8.4.0-7.rhel8.s390x requires edb-pem-server = 8.4.0-7.rhel8, but none of the providers can be installed
  - cannot install the best candidate for the job
(try to add '--allowerasing' to command line to replace conflicting packages or '--skip-broken' to skip uninstallable packages or '--nobest' to use not only best candidate packages)
[root@etpgxlt firstuser]# 
```

To resolve the issue, remove the `python3-mod_wsgi` package and try installing PEM again.

```shell
dnf remove python3-mod_wsgi
```

### Errors from JIT

If JIT is enabled on the PEM backend Postgres instances, you may see this error in the worker.log after configuring the PEM server on RHEL, Rocky, Alma or Oracle Linux.

```text

PL/pgSQL function pem.clear_job_zombies(integer) line 8 at SQL statement
```

To resolve the error, set the `jit` parameter to `off` in `postgresql.conf` file of the backend database server:

```ini
jit=off
```

Restart the backend database server.

### Crash due to bug in RHEL Python 3.9 standard library

If your RHEL 9, Rocky 9, Alma 9, or Oracle Linux 9 server is running an impacted Python 3.9 version, an error appears during PEM configuration that ends with:

```text
TypeError: realpath() got an unexpected keyword argument 'strict'
```

You can resolve the error by updating to the latest Python 3.9 packages.
We have verified the issue isn't present in the latest release of
Python 3.9.21 as of October 2025. However, it was present in some earlier
releases of 3.9.21 as well as earlier Python versions.

```shell
dnf upgrade python3
```

Retry PEM configuration.

## Reconfiguring the PEM server

In some situations, you might need to uninstall the PEM server, reinstall it, and then configure the server again. To do so:

1.  Remove the PEM server configuration and uninstall:

    ```shell
    /usr/edb/pem/bin/configure-pem-server.sh -un
    ```

2.  Remove the PEM packages:

    ```shell
    yum erase edb-pem-server
    ```

3.  Drop the `pem` database:

    ```sql
    DROP DATABASE pem
    ```

4.  Move the certificates from `/root/.pem/` to another location:

    ```shell
    mv /root/.pem/* <new_location>
    ```

5.  Move the `agent.cfg` file from `/usr/edb/pem/agent/etc/agent.cfg` to another location:

    ```shell
    mv /usr/edb/pem/agent/etc/agent.cfg <new_location>
    ```

6. Move the configuration data directory to another location:

    ```shell
    mv /var/lib/pemhome/.pem <new_location>
    ```

7.  Then, configure the PEM server again:

    ```shell
    /usr/edb/pem/bin/configure-pem-server.sh
    ```

## PEM web application not loading

If the PEM web application isn't loading, [check the web services are running](managing_pem_server.mdx#controlling-the-web-server-on-linux).
If they are running, check the web server and application error logs. 

If you are using NGINX as the web server, the web server logs are located at `/var/log/nginx/error.log` and the application logs are at `/var/log/edb-uwsgi/pem.log`

If you are using Apache HTTPD The log is located at `/var/log/httpd/error_log`.
This file contains both web server and application error messages.

If you are using Apache HTTPD as the web server, and see the following message in the log:

```text
Truncated or oversized response headers received from daemon process 'edbpem': /usr/edb/pem/web/pem.wsgi
```

Add the following statement at the bottom of the Apache `httpd.conf` file located in the `/etc/httpd/conf` folder:

```shell
WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
```

Restart the HTTPD server after adding the statement:

```shell
sudo systemctl restart httpd.service
```

## Error connecting to PostgreSQL server

When connecting to a PostgreSQL server, you might get one of these error messages. Review the message carefully. Each error message attempts to incorporate the information you need to resolve the problem. 

- **Connection to the server has been lost**: This error message indicates that the connection attempt took longer than the specified threshold. There might be a problem with the connection properties provided on the Server dialog box, network connectivity issues, or the server might not be running.

- **Could not connect to Server: Connection refused**: There are two possible reasons for this error:  

    -   The database server isn't running. Start the server.
    -   The server isn't configured to accept TCP/IP requests on the address shown.

    For security reasons, a PostgreSQL server "out of the box" doesn't listen on TCP/IP ports. Instead, you must enable it to listen for TCP/IP requests. Add `tcpip = true` to the `postgresql.conf` file for Versions 7.3.x and 7.4.x. Add `listen_addresses='*'` for Version 8.0.x and above. These additions make the server accept connections on any IP interface.

    For more information, refer to the PostgreSQL documentation about [runtime configuration](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/runtime-config.html).

- **FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry**: If PEM displays this message when connecting, your server can be contacted correctly over the network, but it isn't configured to accept your connection. Your client wasn't detected as a legal user for the database.

    To connect to a server, configure the `pg_hba.conf` file on the database server to accept connections from the host of the PEM client. Modify the `pg_hba.conf` file on the database server host, and add an entry in the form:

    -   `host template1 postgres 192.168.0.0/24 md5` for an IPV4 network
    -   `host template1 postgres ::ffff:192.168.0.0/120 md5` for an IPV6 network

    For more information, see the PostgreSQL documentation about [client authentication](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/client-authentication.html).

- **FATAL: password authentication failed**: The `password authentication failed for user` error message indicates there might be a problem with the password you entered. Retry the password to confirm you entered it correctly. If the error message returns, make sure that you have the correct password, that you are authorized to access the server, and that the access was correctly configured in the server's `postgresql.conf` configuration file.

## PEM web server connectivity check

Run this command to check whether your client can reach the PEM server and obtain a response:

```shell
curl https://<SERVER_ADDR>:8443/pem/misc/ping -k -i
__OUTPUT__
PING
```

Where `<SERVER_ADDR>` is the IP address of your PEM server. The output `PING` confirms the PEM web server is up and running.
