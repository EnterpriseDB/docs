Released: 21st July 2025

This is a bug-fix release for PEM 10.

!!!Important
This release only includes fixes for the PEM agent (all platforms) when used with PEM Server 10.1.1 and later, and the PEM Windows installer.

For this reason, you don't need to apply this patch to existing PEM server installations, or to PEM Agents used with a PEM server version earlier than 10.1.1.
