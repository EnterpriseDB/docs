## Enhancements

<table class="table w-100"><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th width="10%">Addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><details><summary>Added support for monitoring and switchover of Patroni clusters.</summary><hr/><p>PEM 10.1 includes a new 'Patroni Cluster Status' to collect information from Patroni.
This information is displayed in the Streaming Replication dashboard for Patroni nodes.
Additionally, PEM now includes five server-level alert templates for Patroni nodes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patroni cluster paused</li>
<li>Patroni DCS not healthy</li>
<li>Patroni down or out of contact</li>
<li>Patroni no leader detected</li>
<li>Patroni timeline mismatch</li>
</ul>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>PEM now automatically tags PGD nodes with their role.</summary><hr/><p>A new probe 'PGD Node Roles' has been added to PEM.
This probe collects the roles of each PGD node.
The data collected by the probe is used to automatically label nodes by role.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Added support for multi-host connection strings from web application to PEM server</summary><hr/><p>When configuring a PEM web application, you may now provide multiple host addresses for the PEM backend.
The web application will try each in turn until it finds one that accepts write connections.
This should be used in conjunction with a <a href="/pem/10/considerations/ha_pem">suitable High Availability architecture</a>.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Added support for multi-host connection strings PEM Agent to PEM backend database server.</summary><hr/><p>When configuring a PEM agent, you may now provide multiple host addresses for the PEM backend.
The agent will try each in turn until it finds one that accepts write connections.
This should be used in conjunction with a <a href="/pem/10/considerations/ha_pem">suitable High Availability architecture</a>.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Introduced a <code>pem.register_pem_server(server_id)</code> function to allow registering a database server as a replica PEM server</summary><hr/><p>When configuring a High Availbility PEM architecture, this option may be used to register additional copies of the PEM backend.
The function creates static system tasks for all these servers, but they are disabled by default.
They will be enabled only for the primary.
After promotion, the new primary PEM server will take over the system tasks automatically.
This removes the dependency of server/agent id 1 to run the system jobs which existed in prior versions of PEM.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Added new API version v14</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Introduced a <code>Steps</code> sub-panel within the Scheduled Task detail view.</summary><hr/><p>This panel displays all steps associated with a task, along with the last run status and execution time of each step, enabling better visibility and monitoring.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Added `--cluster-name` switch for pemworker to specify cluster name when registering agent/server.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>PEM Agents can now be included in Clusters</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>PEM can now call a webhook on job completion/failure.</summary><hr/><p>When configuring a webhook endpoint. You may now choose between 'Alert' and 'Job' webhook types.
Webhooks of type 'job' will be fired according to the notification settings of each job.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Added the ability to enable disabled probes from charts that depend on them.</td><td></td></tr>

## Changes

<table class="table w-100"><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th width="10%">Addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><details><summary>Merged pgAdmin4 9.2.</summary><hr/><p>PEM 10.1 is based on pgAdmin 9.2 and therefore inherits the majority of <a href="https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/9.2/release_notes_9_2.html">fixes and features</a> from this release.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Added ability for PEM to display info messages on charts, for example if data is missing.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Added pywinpty package to dependencies on Windows.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Jobs which are created by an alert are no longer listed in the PEM object explorer.</summary><hr/><p>Jobs created by alerts were previously visible in object explorer. This led to confusion as users were able to edit these jobs in unintended ways which would typically result in breakage.</p></details></td><td></td></tr>
