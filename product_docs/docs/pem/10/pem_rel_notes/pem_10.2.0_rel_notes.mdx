- Automatically disable redundant alerts on replicas
- PEM can now run in FIPS-enabled environments
- Support for monitoring EDB Postgres Distributed 6

## Enhancements

<table class="table w-100"><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th width="10%">Addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><details><summary>Added alert support for EFM/Patroni failover events.</summary><hr/><p>PEM now provides a built-in alert for failover in EFM and Patroni clusters.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>The 'Last Vacuum' and 'Last AutoVacuum' alerts are now disabled automatically on replica nodes.</summary><hr/><p>PEM will no automatically disable the 'Last Vacuum' and
'Last AutoVacuum' alerts on servers which are currently physical
replicas of a primary.
This ensures you do not get duplicate alerts in primary/standby clusters.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Added new probes `bdr_node_group_config_summary` and `bdr_analytic_slot_name`
for EDB Postgres Distributed 6; updated the `bdr_node_summary` probe to include the `node_uuid` column.
</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Added a new column `parent_table_name` to the `oc_table` probe to indicate partitioned/parent table relationships.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Introduced new config item <code>SESSION_DIGEST_METHOD</code> to support FIPS-enabled environments.</summary><hr/><p>The new configuration option <code>SESSION_DIGEST_METHOD</code> allows the user
to specify the default crytographic hash used for signing data in
the PEM web application. The default is 'hashlib.sha1'. In future
this will change to 'hashlib.sha256' as sha1 is deprecated. You may
change to sha256 today by specifying
<code>SESSION_DIGEST_METHOD = 'hashlib.sha256'</code> in <code>config_local.py</code>.
Prior to this change, PEM would reference the MD5 hash library,
and even though it wasn't used this would cause PEM to crash on
FIPS-enabled systems where OpenSSL doesn't provide MD5.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Introduced dynamic naming for the Monitoring panel.</summary><hr/><p>The text displayed in the tab for monitoring panels is now a
descriptive name based on the contents of the panel.
This makes it easier to navigate with multiple panels open.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Enhanced line chart tooltips to display seconds in timestamp values.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Upgraded HTTPD to 2.4.65 for PEM Windows installer.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Added self-diagnostic queries to the System Configuration report.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Enabled Markdown formatting in chart description tooltips.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>PEM will now preserve the SSL port, SSL certificate path, and ServerName when upgrading or reconfiguring PEM.</summary><hr/><p>This change allows users to change these parameters to suit their environment without having them overwritten during PEM upgrade.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>

## Changes

<table class="table w-100"><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th width="10%">Addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><details><summary>Removed MD5 implementation from the PEM agent</summary><hr/><p>Removed some unused code from the PEM Agent which implemented the
MD5 hash algorithm.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Renamed heartbeat_interval to heartbeat_tolerance and changed the behavior be easier to understand.</summary><hr/><p>In prior versions of PEM, the <code>heartbeat_interval</code> setting (a
setting for each PEM agent stored in the PEM server) determined how
long PEM would wait for a heartbeat until an agent was considered
down. Specifically, if there was no heartbeat for
<code>2 * heartbeat_interval + 15 seconds</code>, the agent was considered down.
Fifteen seconds is the gap between heartbeats.
The name of the parameter often caused confusion, with users
thinking they were setting the heartbeat period.
The factor of two in the formula above also caused confusion.</p>
<p>We have replaced the setting with <code>heartbeat_tolerance</code> and adjusted
the formula to <code>heartbeat_tolerance + 15 seconds</code> to make the
behavior more obvious.</p>
<p>When upgrading to PEM 10.2, your previous settings will be respected
and converted into an equivalent <code>heartbeat_tolerance</code>.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Removed support for PostgreSQL and EPAS versions older than 11 from the Alternate Code tab in Manage Probes.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Changed the `unregister-server` CLI option from using the `--server-addr` to `--asb-host-name` for consistency.</td><td></td></tr>
