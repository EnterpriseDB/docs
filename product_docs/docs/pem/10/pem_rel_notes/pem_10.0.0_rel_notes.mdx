!!! Warning RHEL 9 and Kerberos
Due to a package compatibility issue, PEM 10.0 doesn't support Kerberos authentication on RHEL 9.
Kerberos authentication on all other supported platforms is unaffected.
Users of Kerberos on RHEL 9 should wait for a future release of PEM 10 before upgrading.
!!!

New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Postgres Enterprise Manager 10.0 include the following:

## Highlights

- Support for grouping servers and agents into clusters, with automatic tagging of the server role
- Refreshed, more performant user interface including workspaces to keep your tabs better organized
- Better performance due to optimized deletion of expired data
- Support for NGINX web server

## Enhancements

<table class="table w-100"><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th width="10%">Addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><details><summary>Added support for Clusters in Object Explorer.</summary><hr/><p>PEM 10 introduces the concept of Clusters. These are groupings of Servers and Agents used to represent a High Availability (HA) cluster, for example a cluster using Postgres Distributed or EDB Failover Manager.
You can create and populate Clusters in the Object Explorer. In future releases we will expand this functionality to improve the experience of working with HA clusters in PEM.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Added support for tagging servers and agents.</summary><hr/><p>PEM now supports arbitrary tagging of servers. Presently this is purely a cosmetic feature. In the future we will expand it to support filtering and selection by tags.</p></details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Ported the UI to the React framework with numerous useability improvements.</summary><hr/><p>The entire PEM user interface has been ported to the React framework. This brings the PEM project back into line with pgAdmin, making it easier for us to ull enhancements from the upstream.
It also delivers a more modern and performant interface. We have taken advantage of this porting to make numerous improvements to the UI including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Added pagination in Probes/Alerts.</li>
<li>Implemented workspaces.</li>
<li>Divided scheduled tasks into Task and History tabs.</li>
<li>Implemented a dialog view for creating Alerts, Probes and other objects, replacing the grid view.</li>
</ul>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Incorporated recent enhancements from pgAdmin.</summary><hr/><p>The updated architecture of PEM 10 has allowed us to pull many enhancements from pgAdmin including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Generate Entity Relationship Diagrams</li>
<li>Plot charts in Query Tool results</li>
<li>Show real-time system metrics dashboard using the systemstats extension</li>
</ul>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Added <code>read_operations</code> and <code>write_operations</code> columns for IO Analysis probe.</summary><hr/><p>This data can be used to monitor and alert on IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second), which is of particular relevance when using cloud storage.</p></details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Added a <code>node_type</code> column to the <code>server_info</code> probe.</summary><hr/><p>The <code>node_type</code> may take one of the following values: <code>primary</code>, <code>replica</code>, <code>readonly</code>, <code>standalone</code>.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Separated PEM tabs into workspaces for easier management.</summary><hr/><p>Panels/Tabs for the following PEM components will be opened in the
'Enterprise Manager' workspace:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alert templates</li>
<li>Email group</li>
<li>Webhooks</li>
<li>Custom probes</li>
<li>Manage Charts</li>
</ul>
<p>Panels/Tabs for the following PEM components will be opened in the
'Enterprise Tools' workspace:</p>
<ul>
<li>SQL Profiler</li>
<li>Performance diagnosis</li>
<li>Capacity manager report</li>
</ul>
<p>Panels/Tabs for the following PEM components will be opened in the
'Object Explorer' workspace:</p>
<ul>
<li>Probe configuration</li>
<li>Alerts</li>
</ul>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Added support for NGINX as the default web server.</summary><hr/><p>PEM 10 supports both Apache HTTPD and NGINX as the web server on Linux. On Windows only Apache HTTPD is supported. The default for new installations is NGINX. Upgrades from PEM 9 will continue to use Apache HTTPD unless you opt to switch the web server by running the <code>/usr/edb/pem/bin/switch-web-server.sh</code> script.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Added support for 'minimum query duration' in SQL Profiler.</summary><hr/><p>You can now specify a minimum query duration when creating a trace in SQL Profiler. This allows you to only trace long-running queries, which in turn means you can run a trace for a much longer period without exceeding the size limit.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Added Ubuntu 24.04 support.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>The PEM agent will now wait for a while after connecting to the PEM server to avoid false alerts.</summary><hr/><p>This is configurable via the <code>alert_reconnect_delay</code> parameter in <code>agent.cfg</code>.</p></details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Added support for EFM 5.0; 'xlog*' columns are renamed as 'lsn*'.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>PEM will automatically add tags showing whether a server is a primary or a replica.</td><td></td></tr>
