!!!Important PEM Agent 10.3 Compatibility and Registration
The `pemworker` utility in PEM agent 10.3 can't register a new server if the PEM server version is earlier than 10.3. This is a known issue scheduled for resolution in a future release.

**Recommended Workarounds** &mdash;
If you need to register a server with a PEM server version earlier than 10.3, you can use one of the following methods:
1. **Registration via Web UI** &mdash; Register the server using the PEM web application interface.
2. **Staged agent upgrade** &mdash; First register the server using PEM agent version 10.2, then upgrade the agent to version 10.3.
!!!

!!!Note
When upgrading to PEM 10.3 on a RHEL 9 system where the `libcurl-minimal` package is installed, you must pass the `dnf --allow-erasing` option.
!!!

New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Postgres Enterprise Manager 10.3 include the following:

## Highlights

- New **Profiles** feature to ease the management of probe and alert configuration across many server and agents
- New options to make it easier to bring your own SSL infrastructure with PEM
- New built-in alerts for EFM cluster health
- FIPS-compliant cryptography module
- Support for Postgres 18

## Enhancements

</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>New granular Postgres roles have been introduced to control user access to various pgAdmin-based tools, including the Query Tool and Schema Diff Tool.</summary><hr/><p>The following new roles have been added:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>query_tool</code></li>
<li><code>schema_diff_tool</code></li>
<li><code>debugger_tool</code></li>
<li><code>erd_tool</code></li>

<tr><td><details><summary>Implemented a FIPS-compliant SHA256-based PEM cryptography module for password storage.</summary><hr/><p>Implemented a new cryptographic module using SHA256 for encryption of stored passwords, deprecating the old SHA1-based crypto.
New installations of PEM 10.3 will use the new module only. Systems that are upgraded to 10.3 will use the new module to encrypt passwords, and the old module to decrypt existing ones.
A future release of PEM will provide a mechanism to migrate existing passwords to the new module.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Added an alert template 'EFM Fewer Than N Nodes Active'.</summary><hr/><p>A new alert template, 'EFM Fewer Than N Nodes Active', has been added to monitor the number of active nodes in an EFM cluster.
The new alert template is not set to auto-create, so users should create alerts from them as required.
The server <strong>replication solution</strong> must be set to EFM to use this alert.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Introduced a new API version v15 which supports <code>profile_id</code> assignment in the server and agent endpoints.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Added new options to suppress creation of SSL certificates during PEM configuration and agent registration.</summary><hr/><p>If you are installing PEM in an environment where SSL certificates are provided externally, you can suppress generation of SSL certificates by PEM using these new options when invoking <code>configure_pem_server.sh</code>.
The <code>--skip-db-certificate</code> option has the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prevents the creation of a server certification for Postgres.</li>
<li>Disables the check for the <code>sslutils</code> extension and the creation of a CA certificate</li>
<li>and Sets <code>-o check_server_certificate_expiry=false</code>  and <code>-o skip_db_certificate=true</code> during local agent registration meaning no client certificates will be generated and the certificate renewal system job will be disabled.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <code>--skip-web-certificate</code> option  prevents the creation of a self-signed web server certificate.</p>
<p>The <code>--use-trusted-ssl-db-certificates</code> option is a convenience flag which is equivalent to both <code>--skip-db-certificate</code> and <code>--no-hba-change</code>.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Added Tab preservation for PEM-related Panels.</summary><hr/><p>Tab preservation has been implemented for PEM-related panels, ensuring that your open tabs remain active when navigating or restarting the application.</p>

</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>PEM will now automatically blackout any servers or agents that have not been reachable for 48 hours.</summary><hr/><p>A scheduled job runs hourly to check the server/agent heartbeat against the <code>server_contact_timeout</code> configuration.
If unreachable for 48 hours, the object is blacked out; if reachable again, the blackout is undone.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Added built-in alert templates for &quot;EFM Agent Down&quot; and &quot;EFM Missing Primary&quot;.</summary><hr/><p>These new alert templates are not set to auto-create, so users should create alerts from them as required.
The server <strong>replication solution</strong> must be set to EFM to use these alerts.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>The PEM installer for Windows now integrates sslutils 1.4, which adds support for specifying a certificate expiration period through parameters.</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Upgraded Boost package to 1.89 for PEM agent Windows installer.</td><td></td></tr>

## Changes

<table class="table w-100"><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th width="10%">Addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><details><summary>Using variable PEM_HOST instead of HOST not to conflict with the environment variable.</summary><hr/><p>The <code>HOST</code> variable used for the PEM DB server host address during PEM installation in web mode has been changed to <code>PEM_HOST</code> to avoid conflicts with existing environment variables.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>PEM will no longer create an <code>agent_&lt;id&gt;</code> user when registering an agent with <code>--pem-agent-user</code> specified.</summary><hr/><p>In previous versions, PEM would create a Postgres user for every registered agent, even if an existing user was specified with <code>--pem-agent-user</code>.
This is no longer the case in PEM 10.3. A Postgres user will only be created if it is not specified.</p>
</details></td><td>43623</td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>The Performance Diagnostic selection bar is now set to full width by default.</summary><hr/><p>In Performance Diagnostic, the purple selection bar now defaults to full width to ensure the query list is populated immediately, improving usability.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>PEM now enables Barman probes by default.</summary><hr/><p>In previous versions, the Barman probes were disabled by default and had to be enabled before any data would be collected from registered by any instances.
Since the Barman probes do nothing when there are no Barman instances, and are essential for all Barman functionality, we now enable them by default when PEM is configured.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>The SNMP++ library has been upgraded to version 3.6.3 from the previous 3.6.0.</td><td></td></tr>

## Bug Fixes

<table class="table w-100"><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th width="10%">Addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody>

</details></td><td>54064</td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Fixed an issue whereby the PEM agent was not able to send email if <code>libcurl-minimal</code> is installed on RHEL 9.</summary><hr/><p>The PEM Agent requires the <code>libcurl</code> package in order to send SMTP to a mail server.
We found that the package-level requirement for <code>libcurl</code> was met by a package <code>libcurl-minimal</code>, frequently found in RHEL 9 builds.
However this package does not provide the libraries needed for SMTP, so PEM 10.3 now depends on <code>libcurl-full</code>.
When installing PEM 10.3 packages on a system with <code>libcurl-full</code> you must pass the <code>--allow-erasing</code> option to allow dnf to remove <code>libcurl-minimal</code>.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>

to remove string length restrictions, resolving `value too long&quot; errors.</p>
