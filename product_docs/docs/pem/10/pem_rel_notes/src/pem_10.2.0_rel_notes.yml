product: Postgres Enterprise Manager
version: 10.2.0
date: 14 August 2025
intro: |
  New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Postgres Enterprise Manager 10.2 include the following:

highlights: |
  - New alerts for failover events
  - Automatically disable redundant alerts on replicas
  - PEM can now run in FIPS-enabled environments
  - Support for monitoring EDB Postgres Distributed 6

relnotes:

- relnote: Introduced dynamic naming for the Monitoring panel.
  type: Enhancement
  jira: PEM-5566
  details: |
    The text displayed in the tab for monitoring panels is now a 
    descriptive name based on the contents of the panel. 
    This makes it easier to navigate with multiple panels open.
  impact: low

- relnote: Added alert support for EFM/Patroni failover events.
  type: Enhancement
  jira: PEM-4443
  details: |
    PEM now provides a built-in alert for failover in EFM and Patroni clusters.
  impact: high

- relnote: The 'Last Vacuum' and 'Last AutoVacuum' alerts are now disabled automatically on replica nodes.
  type: Enhancement
  jira: PEM-5669
  details: |
    PEM will no automatically disable the 'Last Vacuum' and 
    'Last AutoVacuum' alerts on servers which are currently physical
     replicas of a primary.
     This ensures you do not get duplicate alerts in primary/standby clusters.

- relnote: Renamed heartbeat_interval to heartbeat_tolerance and changed the behavior be easier to understand.
  type: Change
  jira: PEM-4916
  details: |
    In prior versions of PEM, the `heartbeat_interval` setting (a
    setting for each PEM agent stored in the PEM server) determined how
    long PEM would wait for a heartbeat until an agent was considered
    down. Specifically, if there was no heartbeat for 
    `2 * heartbeat_interval + 15 seconds`, the agent was considered down. 
    Fifteen seconds is the gap between heartbeats.
    The name of the parameter often caused confusion, with users 
    thinking they were setting the heartbeat period. 
    The factor of two in the formula above also caused confusion.

    We have replaced the setting with `heartbeat_tolerance` and adjusted
    the formula to `heartbeat_tolerance + 15 seconds` to make the
    behavior more obvious.

    When upgrading to PEM 10.2, your previous settings will be respected
    and converted into an equivalent `heartbeat_tolerance`.

  jira: PEM-5639

- relnote: Introduced new config item `SESSION_DIGEST_METHOD` to support FIPS-enabled environments.
  type: Enhancement
  jira: PEM-5658
  details: |
    The new configuration option `SESSION_DIGEST_METHOD` allows the user
    to specify the default crytographic hash used for signing data in
    the PEM web application. The default is 'hashlib.sha1'. In future
    this will change to 'hashlib.sha256' as sha1 is deprecated. You may
    change to sha256 today by specifying 
    `SESSION_DIGEST_METHOD = 'hashlib.sha256'` in `config_local.py`.
    Prior to this change, PEM would reference the MD5 hash library,
    and even though it wasn't used this would cause PEM to crash on 
    FIPS-enabled systems where OpenSSL doesn't provide MD5.
