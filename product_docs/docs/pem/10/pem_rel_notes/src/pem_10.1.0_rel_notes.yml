    details: |
      PEM 10.1 includes a new 'Patroni Cluster Status' to collect information from Patroni.
      This information is displayed in the Streaming Replication dashboard for Patroni nodes.
      Additionally, PEM now includes five server-level alert templates for Patroni nodes:
        - Patroni cluster paused
        - Patroni DCS not healthy

  - relnote: PEM now automatically tags PGD nodes with their role.
    type: Enhancement
    jira: PEM-5559
    details: |
      A new probe 'PGD Node Roles' has been added to PEM.
      This probe collects the roles of each PGD node.
      The data collected by the probe is used to automatically label nodes by role.
    impact: high 
  - relnote: Added new API version v14
    type: Enhancement
    jira: PEM-5576
    impact: low
  - relnote: Added support for multi-host connection strings from web application to PEM server
    type: Enhancement
    jira: 
    - PEM-5561
    - PEM-5580
    details: |
      When configuring a PEM web application, you may now provide multiple host addresses for the PEM backend.
      The web application will try each in turn until it finds one that accepts write connections.
      This should be used in conjunction with a [suitable High Availability architecture](/pem/10/considerations/ha_pem).
    impact: medium 
  - relnote: Added support for multi-host connection strings PEM Agent to PEM backend database server.
    type: Enhancement
    jira: PEM-5367
    details: |
      When configuring a PEM agent, you may now provide multiple host addresses for the PEM backend.
      The agent will try each in turn until it finds one that accepts write connections.
      This should be used in conjunction with a [suitable High Availability architecture](/pem/10/considerations/ha_pem).
    impact: medium
  - relnote: Introduced a `Steps` sub-panel within the Scheduled Task detail view. 
    type: Enhancement
    jira: PEM-5539
    details: |
      This panel displays all steps associated with a task, along with the last run status and execution time of each step, enabling better visibility and monitoring.
    impact: low
  - relnote: Added `--cluster-name` switch for pemworker to specify cluster name when registering agent/server.
    type: Enhancement
    jira: PEM-5522
    impact: low
  - relnote: PEM Agents can now be included in Clusters
    type: Enhancement
    jira: PEM-5577
    impact: low
  - relnote: Merged pgAdmin4 9.2.
    type: Change
    jira: PEM-5553
    details: |
      PEM 10.1 is based on pgAdmin 9.2 and therefore inherits the majority of [fixes and features](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/9.2/release_notes_9_2.html) from this release.
    impact: low
  - relnote: PEM can now call a webhook on job completion/failure.
    type: Enhancement
    jira: PEM-5541
    details: |
      When configuring a webhook endpoint. You may now choose between 'Alert' and 'Job' webhook types.
      Webhooks of type 'job' will be fired according to the notification settings of each job.
    impact: low
  - relnote: Introduced a `pem.register_pem_server(server_id)` function to allow registering a database server as a replica PEM server
    type: Enhancement
    jira: PEM-558
    details: |
      When configuring a High Availbility PEM architecture, this option may be used to register additional copies of the PEM backend.
      The function creates static system tasks for all these servers, but they are disabled by default.
      They will be enabled only for the primary.
      After promotion, the new primary PEM server will take over the system tasks automatically. 
      This removes the dependency of server/agent id 1 to run the system jobs which existed in prior versions of PEM.
