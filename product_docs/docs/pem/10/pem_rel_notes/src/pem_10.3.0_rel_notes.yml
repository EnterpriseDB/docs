product: Postgres Enterprise Manager
version: 10.3.0
date: 25 November 2025
intro: |

  !!!Important
  When upgrading to PEM 10.3 on a RHEL 9 system where the `libcurl-minimal` package is installed, you must pass the `dnf --allow-erasing` option.
  !!!

  New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Postgres Enterprise Manager 10.3 include the following:

highlights: |
  - ...
relnotes:

- relnote: PEM will no longer create an `agent_<id>` user when registering an agent with `--pem-agent-user`
    specified.
  type: Change
  jira: PEM-5394
  details: |
    In previous versions, PEM would create a Postgres user for every registered agent, even if an existing user was specified with `--pem-agent-user`.
    This is no longer the case in PEM 10.3. A Postgres user will only be created if on is not specified.

- relnote: PEM will now automatically blackout any servers or agents that has not been reachable for 48 hours.
  type: Enhancement
  jira: PEM-4676
  impact: low

- relnote: PEM will now enable Barman probes by default.
  type: Change
  jira: PEM-5128
  details: |
    In previous versions, the Barman probes were disabled by default and had to be enabled before any data would be collected from registered by and instances.
    Since the Barman probes do nothing when there are no Barman instances, and are essential for all Barman functionality, we now enable them by default when PEM is configured.
  impact: low

- relnote: Added built-in alert templates for "EFM Agent Down" and "EFM Missing Primary".
  type: Enhancement
  jira: PEM-5730
  details: |
    These new alert templates are not set to auto-create, so users should create alerts from them as required.
    The server **replication solution** must be set to EFM to use these alerts.

- relnote: Fixed an issue whereby the PEM agent is not able to send email if libcurl-minimal is installed on RHEL 9.
  type: Bug Fix
  jira: PEM-5772
  details: |
    The PEM Agent requires the `libcurl` package in order to send SMTP to a mail server.
    We found that the package-level requirement for `libcurl` was met by a package `libcurl-minimal`, frequently found in RHEL 9 builds. 
    However this package does not provide the libraries needed for SMTP, so PEM 10.3 now depends on `libcurl-full.
    When installing PEM 10.3 packages on a system with `libcurl-full` you must pass the `--allow-erasing` option to allow dnf to remove `libcurl-minimal`.
