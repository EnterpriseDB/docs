intro: |
  !!! Warning RHEL 9 and Kerberos
  Due to a package compatibility issue, PEM 10.0 doesn't support Kerberos authentication on RHEL 9.
  Kerberos authentication on all other supported platforms is unaffected.
  Users of Kerberos on RHEL 9 should wait for a future release of PEM 10 before upgrading.
  !!!

  New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Postgres Enterprise Manager 10.0 include the following:
highlights: |
  - Support for grouping servers and agents into clusters, with automatic tagging of the server role
  - Refreshed, more performant user interface including workspaces to keep your tabs better organized
  - Better performance due to optimized deletion of expired data
  - Support for NGINX web server
relnotes:
  - relnote: Ported the UI to the React framework with numerous useability improvements.
    type: Enhancement
    details: |
      The entire PEM user interface has been ported to the React framework. This brings the PEM project back into line with pgAdmin, making it easier for us to ull enhancements from the upstream.
      It also delivers a more modern and performant interface. We have taken advantage of this porting to make numerous improvements to the UI including:
        - Added pagination in Probes/Alerts.
        - Implemented workspaces.
        - Divided scheduled tasks into Task and History tabs.
        - Implemented a dialog view for creating Alerts, Probes and other objects, replacing the grid view.

  - relnote: Incorporated recent enhancements from pgAdmin.
    type: Enhancement
    details: |
      The updated architecture of PEM 10 has allowed us to pull many enhancements from pgAdmin including:
        - Generate Entity Relationship Diagrams
        - Plot charts in Query Tool results
        - Show real-time system metrics dashboard using the systemstats extension
    impact: medium
  - relnote: Added `read_operations` and `write_operations` columns for IO Analysis probe.
    type: Enhancement
    jira: PEM-5052
    details: "This data can be used to monitor and alert on IOPS (Input/Output Operations Per Second), which is of particular relevance when using cloud storage."
    impact: medium
  - relnote: Added support for Clusters in Object Explorer.
    type: Enhancement
    jira: PEM-5372
    details: |
      PEM 10 introduces the concept of Clusters. These are groupings of Servers and Agents used to represent a High Availability (HA) cluster, for example a cluster using Postgres Distributed or EDB Failover Manager.
      You can create and populate Clusters in the Object Explorer. In future releases we will expand this functionality to improve the experience of working with HA clusters in PEM.

  - relnote: Added support for 'minimum query duration' in SQL Profiler.
    type: Enhancement
    details: >
       You can now specify a minimum query duration when creating a trace in SQL Profiler.
       This allows you to only trace long-running queries, which in turn means you can run a trace for a much longer period without exceeding the size limit.

  - relnote: Log Analysis Expert, Tuning Wizard, Postgres Expert, and Index Advisor are removed.
    type: Change
    details: >
       These features have been removed from PEM 10.0 onwards.
       For Postgres tuning we recommend the [EDB Postgres Tuner](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pg_extensions/pg_tuner/) extension and the [accompany web utility](https://postgrestuner.enterprisedb.com/).
       The Index Advisor extension for EDB Server has been deprecated and replaced by [EDB Query Advisor](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pg_extensions/query_advisor/), which is compatible with all Postgres distributions.
       For log analysis we recommend [pgBadger](https://github.com/darold/pgbadger).
