PEM displays performance statistics through a number of dashboards. Each dashboard contains a series of summary views that contain charts, graphs, and tables that display the statistics related to the selected object.

## Dashboards overview

The PEM client displays the Global Overview dashboard when it connects to the PEM server. Additional dashboards provide statistical information about monitored objects.

### Opening dashboards
Dashboards are presented in a hierarchy comparable to the PEM client tree control. The dashboard for each object in the tree control displays the information for that object as well as for any monitored object that resides below that level in the tree control, if appropriate.

Each dashboard header displays the date and time that the server was started, if relevant, the date and time that the dashboard was last updated, and the current number of triggered alerts. Navigation menus displayed in the dashboard header provide easy access to other dashboards. Menus are organized hierarchically. Only those menus appropriate for the object currently highlighted in the tree control are available.

-   Select **Global Overview** from any dashboard to return to the Global Overview dashboard.
-   Select the name of an agent from the **Agents** menu to navigate to the Operating System Analysis dashboard for that agent.
-   Select a server name from the **Servers** menu to navigate to the Server Analysis dashboard for that server.
-   Select a database name from the **Databases** menu to navigate to the Database Analysis dashboard for that database.
-   Use the **Dashboards** menu to navigate to informational dashboards at the global level or for the selected agent, server, or database.

Dashboards display statistical information in the form of:

-   Tables that provide statistical information collected by a PEM probe.
-   Pie charts that display information collected by the most recent execution of a probe.
-   Bar graphs that display comparative statistics collected by the most recent execution of a probe.
-   Line graphs that display statistical data collected by PEM probes.

You can open a dashboard using either of these techniques:

-   from the **Management > Dashboards** menu, select an active dashboard name.
-   Right-click the name of a monitored object in the tree. From the **Dashboards** menu, select the name of the dashboard to review.

Each dashboard is displayed on the **Monitoring** tab in the main panel of the client window. After opening a dashboard, you can navigate to other dashboards in the same tab.

Each dashboard header includes navigation menus that allow you to navigate to other dashboards. Use your browser's forward and back buttons to scroll through previously viewed dashboards. Use **Refresh** to update the current dashboard.

To sort statistics that are provided in table form, select a column heading. Select it again to reverse the sort order. Each table offers a stable sort feature. For example, to sort a table by ascending Session ID in each user name group, sort first by the Session ID column, then sort by the User Name column.

Hover over the upper-right corner of each graph, chart, or table to reveal the PEM client toolbar icons. Hover over an icon to display a tooltip that briefly explains the icon's functionality:

-   Use the **Refresh** icon to update the information displayed on a dashboard.
-   Use the **Save Chart as Image** icon to save the selected chart as a `.jpeg` image.
-   Use the **Full Screen** icon to enlarge the chart to reveal granular details about the charted data.
-   Use the **Personalize the chart configuration** icon to access a control panel that allows you to select chart-specific display details.
-   Hover over the **Explain** icon to review a description of the information shared in the graph or chart.

In the lower-right corner of each graph or chart is a legend that identifies each item plotted in the graph or chart.

If it's displayed, select the information icon in the upper-left corner of a chart to display a note about the chart content and, if applicable, a link that allows you to enable one or more probes that retrieve content for the chart.

## Available dashboards

PEM offers the following dashboards.

### Alerts dashboard

The Alerts dashboard displays the currently triggered alerts. If opened from the Global Overview, the dashboard displays the current alerts for all monitored nodes on the system. If opened from a node in a server, the report shows alerts related to that node and all monitored objects that reside below that object in the tree.

## Dashboard configuration

Options on the Dashboard Configuration dialog box allow you to link the timelines of all of the line graphs on the dashboard. To open the Dashboard Configuration dialog box, select **Settings** in the dashboard header.

Use the Dashboard Configuration dialog box to control attributes of the charts displayed on the dashboard:

-   Set **Link timelines of all the line charts** to **Enable** to apply the specified timeline to line graphs displayed on the dashboard. If set to **Disable**, your preferences are preserved for later use but don't modify the amount of data displayed.
-   Use the **Days** selector to specify the number of days of gathered data to display on line graphs.
-   Use the **Hour(s)** selector to specify the number of hours of gathered data to display on line graphs.
-   Select **Remember configuration for this dashboard** to apply the customized time span to only the current dashboard only. Leave it cleared to apply the time span globally to line graphs on all dashboards.

Settings specified on the Dashboard Configuration dialog box are applied only to the current user's session.

After you specify your preferences, select **Save**.

## Custom dashboards

PEM displays performance statistics on a number of system-defined dashboards. Each dashboard contains a series of summary views that contain charts, graphs, and tables that display statistics related to the selected object. You can also create custom dashboards with your choice of charts and layout.

To create a custom dashboard, first open an existing dashboard at the same level as the one you wish to create. For example, if you wish to create a new server-level dashboard, open any of the existing server-level dashboards.

Next, click on the `...` menu at the top right of the dashboard and select **Create Dashboard**.
This opens a visual editor with which you can design the dashboard. 

Click **Save** when you are done and the dashboard will appear in the list of dashboards shown in the breadcrumb bar at the top of the screen.

To modify an existing dashboard, select **Edit** to reopen the visual editor.

To delete a dashboard, select **Delete** next to the dashboard name.

To change the permissions of an existing dashboard, select **Share Dashboard**.

To choose who can see this dashboard, click the cog icon next to the dashboard name. By default dashboards are shared with all users. You can make the dashboard private, or restrict it to certain roles.
