PEM displays performance statistics through a number of dashboards. Each dashboard contains a series of summary views that contain charts, graphs, and tables that display the statistics related to the selected object.

## Dashboards overview

The PEM client displays the Global Overview dashboard when it connects to the PEM server. Additional dashboards provide statistical information about monitored objects.

## Accessing in-app help for UI details

The in-app help provides comprehensive details about the PEM web interface, including the menu items, charts and graphs on the dashboards, and the options on the dialog boxes. The in-app help also includes instructions for creating database objects.

- To access the landing page for the help, select **Help > Online help**. 
- To access context-sensitive help for a dialog box, select **?**.

### Opening dashboards
Dashboards are presented in a hierarchy comparable to the PEM client tree control. The dashboard for each object in the tree control displays the information for that object as well as for any monitored object that resides below that level in the tree control, if appropriate.

Each dashboard header displays the date and time that the server was started, if relevant, the date and time that the dashboard was last updated, and the current number of triggered alerts. Navigation menus displayed in the dashboard header provide easy access to other dashboards. Menus are organized hierarchically. Only those menus appropriate for the object currently highlighted in the tree control are available.

-   Select **Global Overview** from any dashboard to return to the Global Overview dashboard.
-   Select the name of an agent from the **Agents** menu to navigate to the Operating System Analysis dashboard for that agent.
-   Select a server name from the **Servers** menu to navigate to the Server Analysis dashboard for that server.
-   Select a database name from the **Databases** menu to navigate to the Database Analysis dashboard for that database.
-   Use the **Dashboards** menu to navigate to informational dashboards at the global level or for the selected agent, server, or database.

Dashboards display statistical information in the form of:

-   Tables that provide statistical information collected by a PEM probe.
-   Pie charts that display information collected by the most recent execution of a probe.
-   Bar graphs that display comparative statistics collected by the most recent execution of a probe.
-   Line graphs that display statistical data collected by PEM probes.

You can open a dashboard using either of these techniques:

-   from the **Management > Dashboards** menu, select an active dashboard name.
-   Right-click the name of a monitored object in the tree. From the **Dashboards** menu, select the name of the dashboard to review.

Each dashboard is displayed on the **Monitoring** tab in the main panel of the client window. After opening a dashboard, you can navigate to other dashboards in the same tab.

Each dashboard header includes navigation menus that allow you to navigate to other dashboards. Use your browser's forward and back buttons to scroll through previously viewed dashboards. Use **Refresh** to update the current dashboard.

To sort statistics that are provided in table form, select a column heading. Select it again to reverse the sort order. Each table offers a stable sort feature. For example, to sort a table by ascending Session ID in each user name group, sort first by the Session ID column, then sort by the User Name column.

Hover over the upper-right corner of each graph, chart, or table to reveal the PEM client toolbar icons. Hover over an icon to display a tooltip that briefly explains the icon's functionality:

-   Use the **Refresh** icon to update the information displayed on a dashboard.
-   Use the **Save Chart as Image** icon to save the selected chart as a `.jpeg` image.
-   Use the **Full Screen** icon to enlarge the chart to reveal granular details about the charted data.
-   Use the **Personalize the chart configuration** icon to access a control panel that allows you to select chart-specific display details.
-   Hover over the **Explain** icon to review a description of the information shared in the graph or chart.

In the lower-right corner of each graph or chart is a legend that identifies each item plotted in the graph or chart.

If it's displayed, select the information icon in the upper-left corner of a chart to display a note about the chart content and, if applicable, a link that allows you to enable one or more probes that retrieve content for the chart.

## Available dashboards
