Profiles are a a centralized and reusable way to manage monitoring configurations and alerts across multiple servers and agents.

A Profile acts as a single template that bundles a specific set of probe configurations and alert definitions. These are the same configurations currently available through the individual Manage Probes and Manage Alerts menus for a specific server or agent.

How profiles work:
- Create a Profile with a specific set of probe configurations and alert definitions.
- Assign the Profile to one or more servers or agents.
- Once assigned, the servers or agents inherit the monitoring settings defined in the Profile immediately.
- Any changes made to the Profile automatically propagate to all assigned servers and agents.

Any server or agent that doesn't have a Profile assigned to it continues to use its individual probe configurations and alert definitions.

## Purpose of using Profiles

The primary purpose of using Profiles is to significantly reduce the administrative burden associated with managing monitoring configurations for a large number of database instances in PEM.

PEM is designed to manage and monitor many instances from a single platform. When dealing with large numbers of servers, manually ensuring that the configuration (probes and alerts) is correct and consistent across all instances can be a time-consuming and error-prone process.

By centralizing settings into reusable Profiles, this feature delivers value by:

- Freeing Up Time &mdash; Automating configuration management across multiple instances, allowing administrators to focus on optimizing database operations rather than administering the monitoring tool.

- Ensuring Consistency &mdash; Guaranteeing that a large fleet of servers adheres to the intended monitoring standards.

- Reducing Errors &mdash; Minimizing the chance of human errors that could lead to misconfigurations and undermine PEM's ability to effectively monitor your environment.

## Key concepts

There are two types of profiles designed to manage different aspects of monitoring:
- **Agent Profile** &mdash; Manages probe configurations and alert definitions for PEM Agents.
- **Server Profile** &mdash; Manages probe configurations and alert definitions for monitored database servers.

The behavior of each profile type is as follows:

| Status              | Configuration source | Behavior                                                                                   |
|---------------------|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| No Profile assigned | Default settings     | The server or agent uses its individual probe configurations and alert definitions.        |
| Profile assigned    | Profile settings     | The server or agent inherits the probe and alert settings defined in the assigned Profile. |

- After assigning a profile to a server or agent, when you modify a Profile that is already assigned to agents or servers, the changes are not applied immediately. They are saved as a draft version.
Changes only take effect on the assigned servers or agents when you explicitly choose to apply the draft changes.

- You also have the option to discard draft changes if you decide not to apply them, by using rollback.

- The individual `Manage Probes` and `Manage Alerts` pages for a profile-managed server or agent will display the current configuration inherited from the assigned Profile, but you can't make direct changes on these pages.

- The `Copy Probes` and `Copy Alerts` options are unavailable when attempting to copy configurations from a non-profile server or agent to a profile managed server or agent.

## Accessing Manage Profiles

The `Manage Profiles` section provides a central interface for creating, configuring, and deploying a reusable monitoring settings across your PEM environment.

- You can access `Manage Profiles` under the `Configuration` menu in the PEM console. `Manage Profiles` tab works independent of objects selected in the object tree. From here, you can,

  - [Create new Profiles](#creating-profiles) 
  - [Edit existing ones](#editing-profiles)
  - [Assign Profiles to servers or agents](#assigning-profiles)
  - [Manage draft changes]

The main table displays key information about each profile:

| Column name        | Description.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| Name               | The unique identifier assigned to the Profile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Type               | The category of the Profile, such as Agent Profile or Server Profile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Active Assignments | The count of servers or agents currently assigned to the Profile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

## Creating Profiles

On the `Manage Profiles` tab use `+` to add a new profile:
1. Click the "Add New" button on the top-right corner of the tab.
2. A dialog box pops-up to select a Target Type &mdash; Server or Agent. Once the target type is selected, it can't be changes for that profile. Click `Next`.
3. A new dialog opens with three tabs of configuration options:
   - **General** &mdash; Enter a unique name and optional description for the Profile.
   - **Probes** &mdash; Select and configure the probes to include in the Profile. Only server, database, schema, agent, and extension-level probes are available for selection at server level.
   - **Alerts** &mdash; Select and configure the alerts to include in the Profile. Only server and agent level alerts are available for selection.
4. After configuring the Profile, click `Save` to create it. The new Profile appears in the `Manage Profiles` table.

## Editing Profiles

On the `Manage Profiles` tab:
- Click the `Edit icon` next to the profile you want to modify.
- The Profile name can't be updated during editing.
- The Profile description, probe configurations, and alerts can be changed.
- If the Profile has active assignments, the `Apply` and `Revert` buttons become available to deploy or discard draft changes.

Changes will only be synced with all assigned servers and agents when you click the `Apply` button. If you click `Revert`, all changes made to the profile will be reset to their previous status.

## Assigning Profiles

In the object tree on the PEM console,
- Right-click on a server or an agent.
- Select `Properties` from the context menu.
- In the Properties dialog, navigate to the `General` tab.
- Locate the `Assigned Profile` field.
- Use the dropdown menu to select the desired Profile to assign to the server or agent.
- Click `Save` to apply the changes.

You can also assign Profiles to a server or an agent using the command line interface. For more information, see []().

## Unassigning Profiles

In the object tree,
- Right-click on a server or an agent.
- Select `Properties` from the context menu.
- In the Properties dialog, navigate to the `General` tab.
- Locate the `Assigned Profile` field.
- Use the dropdown menu to select `<None>` to unassign the Profile from the server or agent.
- Click `Save` to apply the changes.

If you unassign a profile from a server or an agent:
- Probes will reset to their default configurations.
- Alerts will remain, but they will no longer be managed by the Profile.
- You can now manage probes and alerts individually for the server or agent from the respective tabs.
