To monitor the EDB Postgres Distributed group using dashboards, you must enable the following probes. Configure these probes at extension level.

!!! Note
    Prior to version 8.4, all these probes are available at the server level.

The user with pgd_superuser can view information from all the following probes. If you are using a version of EDB Postgres Distributed earlier than 4.0, all these probes work with EDB Postgres Distributed Enterprise Edition.
