The **Probe Configuration** tab displays settings available when creating or modifying a Probe within the Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) interface. Probes are the primary mechanism used to collect performance and metrics from monitored servers and databases.

## General Settings

The General tab contains the fundamental configuration for how and where a probe collects data.

- **Name** &mdash; A unique identifier for the probe.

- **Collection Method** &mdash; Specifies the underlying technology used to gather information:

    - **SQL** &mdash; Gathers data via a SQL statement.

    - **WMI** &mdash; Gathers information via a Windows Management Instrumentation extension.

    - **Batch/Shell Script** &mdash; Uses a command or shell script. These are platform-specific and require a selection in the Platform field. 

- **Target Type** &mdash; Defines the category of metric the probe monitors (e.g., Server, Database, Table, Index).

- **Monitoring Target** &mdash; The specific object type the probe will execute against.

## Execution and Retention

These settings determine the frequency of data collection and how long the resulting data is stored.

- **Execution Frequency** &mdash; The interval at which the probe runs, defined in Minutes and Seconds.

- **Enabled?** &mdash; A toggle to determine if the probe is active by default. Select Yes to enable or No to disable.

- **Data Retention** &mdash; The number of days that gathered information is kept in the probe's history table.

- **Discard from history?**:

    - **No (Default)** &mdash; The server creates a history table to retain gathered data for the duration specified in Data Retention.

    - **Yes** &mdash; The server will discard the collected data rather than archiving it in a history table.

- **Platform** &mdash; Required only for Batch/Shell Script collection methods. Specifies the OS platform (e.g., *nix or Windows) the probe will monitor.

## Managing existing probes

The Probe Configuration tab provides an overview of all system and custom probes.

| Field                   | Description                                                                                                                                        |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Status**              | Indicates if a probe is currently enabled (green checkmark) or disabled (red cross mark).                                                          |
| **Execution Frequency** | Displays the interval at which the probe is set to execute. The **Use default?** toggle allows you to override the default execution frequency.    |
| **History Retention**   | Shows the number of days the probe's historical data is retained. The **Use default?** toggle allows you to override the default retention period. |

!!! Note
    Customizing the **Use default?** settings allows for granular control, such as monitoring a critical "Database Frozen XID" every 12 hours while checking "Server Information" every 15 minutes.
