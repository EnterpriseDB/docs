To export the probe, select any probes from the **Manage Custom Probes** tab, and then select **Export** in the upper-right corner of the table. To generate the JSON file, select **Save File** and then select **OK**.

To import the probe, on the **Manage Custom Probes** tab, select **Import** in the upper-right corner of the table. Select **Browse** to select the JSON file with the probe code to import, and then select **Import**.

After selecting the file to import, you can select the **Skip existing** check box. This option skips the probe if it already exists and displays a message letting you know that the import was skipped.

-  If you don't select the check box and the probe already exists, then it doesn't import the probe and an error message is reported.

    !!! Note
        **Import** can't overwrite the existing probe as it might be configured to retain historical data as per the configured retention policy.

-  If you don't select the check box and the probe doesn't exist but the corresponding table in the `pem` schema does, then it imports the probe successfully using the same table.

!!! Note
    It's possible for the probe to be deleted and not listed on **Manage Custom Probe** tab and for the table holding the data of that probe to exist in the `pem` schema.
