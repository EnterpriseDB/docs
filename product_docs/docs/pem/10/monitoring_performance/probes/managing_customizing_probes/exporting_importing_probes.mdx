description: Learn how to export and import probes in PEM
---

You can export and import probe definitions to share probes across different PEM environments from **Manage Probes** tab. When you export a probe, PEM generates a JSON file with the probe definition. You can use this file to import the probe into another PEM environment. You can also use the generated JSON file as a template to create new probes.

To export the probe:

1. Select any probes from the Probes table.
1. Select outbox arrow icon in the top-right corner of the table 
1. Select **Save File** and then select **OK**, a JSON file with the probe definition is downloaded to your local machine.

To import the probe:

1. Select inbox arrow icon in the top-right corner of the table 
1. Select **Browse** to select the JSON file with the probe code to import.
1. Select **Import**.

After selecting the file to import, you can select the **Skip existing** check box. This option skips the probe if it already exists and displays a message letting you know that the import was skipped.

-  If you don't select the check box and the probe already exists, then it doesn't import the probe and an error message is reported.

!!! Note
    **Import** can't overwrite the existing probe as it might be configured to retain historical data as per the configured retention policy.

-  If you don't select the check box and the probe doesn't exist but the corresponding table in the `pem` schema does, then it imports the probe successfully using the same table.

!!! Note
    It's possible for the probe to be deleted and not listed on **Manage Probes** tab and for the table holding the data of that probe to exist in the `pem` schema.
