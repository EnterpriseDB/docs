You can delete only custom probes. To delete a probe, 

1. Go to the **Manage Probes** tab.
1. Select the probe name in the probes table, and select trash icon to the left of the probe name.

When you delete a probe, PEM deletes the probe definition and all the historical data collected by that probe. The probe history persists for the length of time specified in the **History Retention** field in the probe definition. During the deletion, the probe definition is deleted and any corresponding tables are  dropped from the `pemdata` and `pemhistory` schemas.

System probes are the built-in probes provided by PEM and are part of the PEM schema. You can only modify system probes. If you attempt to delete a system probe, PEM reports an error.
