You can delete only custom probes. To delete a probe, select the probe name in the probes table, and select **Delete** (located to the upper-right corner of the table). The probe history persists for the length of time specified in the **History Retention** field in the probe definition. During the deletion, the probe definition is deleted and any corresponding tables are  dropped from the `pemdata` and `pemhistory` schemas.

System probes are the built-in probes provided by PEM and are part of the PEM schema. You can only modify system probes. If you attempt to delete a system probe, PEM reports an error.
