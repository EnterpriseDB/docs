A probe is a scheduled task that returns a set of performance metrics about a specific monitored object. A probe retrieves statistics from a monitored server, database, operating system, or agent. You can use the **Manage Probes** tab to override the default configuration and customize the behavior of each probe.

To open the **Manage Probes** tab, select **Management > Manage Probes**. The **Manage Probes** tab provides a set of icons that you can use to create and manage probes:

-   Select **Manage Custom Probes** to open the **Custom Probes** tab and create or modify a custom probe.
-   Select **Copy Probes** to open the Copy Probe dialog box and copy the probe configurations from the currently selected object to one or more monitored objects.

!!! Note
    Copy Probe isn't supported for the extension-level probes.

A probe monitors a unique set of metrics for each object type (server, database, database object, or agent). Select the name of an object in the tree to review the probes for that object.

To modify the properties associated with a probe, select the name of a probe and customize the settings that are displayed in the Probes table:

-   Move the **Default** switch in the Execution Frequency columns to **N** to enable the **Minutes** and **Seconds** selectors, and specify a custom value for the length of time between executions of the probe.
-   Move the **Default** switch in the Enabled? column to **No** to change the state of the probe and indicate if the probe is active or not.

!!! Note
    If data from a disabled probe is used in a chart, the chart displays an information icon in the upper-left corner that allows you to enable the probe by clicking the provided link.

-   Move the **Default** switch in the Data Retention column to **No** to enable the **Day(s)** field and specify the number of days that information gathered by the probe is stored on the PEM server.

The **Manage Probes** tab might display information about probes that you can't modify from the current node. If you can't modify a probe from the current dialog box, the switches are disabled. Generally, you can modify a disabled probe from a node that's higher in the hierarchy of the PEM client tree control. Select another object in the tree control to modify the probes that are displayed or enabled in the **Manage Probes** tab.
