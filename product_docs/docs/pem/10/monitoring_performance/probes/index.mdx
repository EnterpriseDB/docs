Probe is a scheduled task performed by a PEM agent to retrieve performance metrics and information about monitored database objects.

The purpose of probe is to collect data and use the collected data to generate graphs and dashboards within the PEM interface.

There are following probes:

## System probes

PEM enables various built-in probes at different hierarchy levels.
  
- **Agent level** &mdash; Monitors host-specific data such as CPU usage, disk space, memory usage, and network statistics.
  
- **Server level** &mdash; Tracks global database information including background writer statistics, blocked sessions, session information, and WAL files.
  
- **Database/Schema level** &mdash; Monitors specific object data such as database size, function statistics, table statistics, and index size.
  
- **Tool-specific probes** &mdash; Includes probes for Barman (backup), Failover manager (HA), Patroni (cluster status), and various replication methods (Slony, Streaming, Replication Server).
