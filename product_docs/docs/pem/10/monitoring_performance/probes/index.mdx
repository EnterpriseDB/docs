Probe is a scheduled task performed by a PEM agent to retrieve performance metrics and information about monitored database objects.

The purpose of probe is to collect data and use the collected data to generate graphs and dashboards within the PEM interface.

There are following probes:

## System probes

PEM enables various built-in probes at different hierarchy levels.
  
- **Agent level** &mdash; Monitors host-specific data such as CPU usage, disk space, memory usage, and network statistics.
  
- **Server level** &mdash; Tracks global database information including background writer statistics, blocked sessions, session information, and WAL files.
  
- **Database/Schema level** &mdash; Monitors specific object data such as database size, function statistics, table statistics, and index size.
  
- **Tool-specific probes** &mdash; Includes probes for Barman (backup), Failover manager (HA), Patroni (cluster status), and various replication methods (Slony, Streaming, Replication Server).

## EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) probes

Probes are explicitly designed for monitoring PGD groups and are typically configured at the extension level.

- **Conflict and performance** &mdash; Monitors conflict history, replication rates, and lag times.

- **Group status** &mdash; Tracks global locks, group subscriptions, raft consensus details, and node roles.

- **Version and error tracking** &mdash; Monitors cluster-wide version consistency and records node-level work errors.

## Managing and customizing probes

You can modify probe settings using Management > Manage Probes tab.

1. **Core management tasks**

   - **Modify schedule** &mdash; Customize execution frequency(minutes/seconds) of probes by disabling the Default switch.
   - **Enable/Disable probes** &mdash; Toggle the status to on or off as needed. Disabled probes used in charts displays an icon to re-enable them.
   - **Data retention** &mdash; Specifies how long probe history is stored before automatic deletion. 
   - **Copying configurations** &mdash; Use the Copy probe button to duplicate probe settings from one object to another except for extension-level probes.

2. **Creating custom probes**

   Custom probes can be created to monitor specific metrics not covered by built-in probes using three collection methods:

   - **SQL Query** &mdash; Write custom SQL queries to fetch specific metrics from the database.
   - **WMI** &mdash; Uses WMI to collect data from Windows systems or other compatible systems.
   - **Batch** &mdash; Uses command-line or shell scripts to gather data from the system. It requires `allow_batch_probes` to be enabled in the agent.cfg file.

3. **Export/Import and deletion**

   - **Export/Import** &mdash; Use the Export/Import buttons to transfer probe configurations between different PEM installations.
   - **Deletion** &mdash; Custom probes can be deleted using the Delete button. System probes cannot be deleted.
