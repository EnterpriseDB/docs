Remote monitoring is monitoring your Postgres cluster using a PEM Agent residing on a different host.

To remotely monitor a Postgres cluster with PEM, you must register the cluster with PEM and bind a PEM agent. See [Registering a server](../registering_database_server) for more information.

The following scenarios require remote monitoring using PEM:

-   Postgres cluster running on AWS RDS
-   [Postgres cluster running on BigAnimal](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/using_cluster/monitoring_and_logging/)

PEM remote monitoring supports:
