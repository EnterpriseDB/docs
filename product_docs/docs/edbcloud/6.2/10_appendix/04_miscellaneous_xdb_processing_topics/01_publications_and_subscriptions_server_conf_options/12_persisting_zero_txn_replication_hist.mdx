!!! Note
    The option described in this section applies to the publication server only.

If you wish to maintain zero transaction count records in the replication history after the publication server is restarted, set persistZeroTxRepEvent to true. Otherwise, zero transaction count records are no longer available once the publication server is restarted.

See Section [Viewing Replication History](../../../07_common_operations/04_view_replication_history/#view_replication_history) for information on viewing replication history.

`persistZeroTxRepEvent={true | false}`

The default value is `false`.
