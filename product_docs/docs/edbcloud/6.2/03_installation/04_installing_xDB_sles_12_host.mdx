<div id="installing_xDB_sles_12_host" class="registered_link"></div>

You can use the `zypper` package manager to install the xDB Replication Server on an SLES 12 host. zypper will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but requires access to specific repositories that are not hosted at EnterpriseDB.

Before installing xDB, use the following commands to add EnterpriseDB repository configuration files to your SLES host:

```text
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas96-sles.repo
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas-sles-tools.repo
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas-sles-dependencies.repo
```

Each command creates a repository configuration file in the /etc/zypp/repos.d directory. The files are named:

-   `edbas96suse.repo`
-   `edbasdependencies.repo`
-   `edbastools.repo`

After creating the repository configuration files, use the `zypper refresh command` to refresh the metadata on your SLES host to include the EnterpriseDB repositories:

```text
/etc/zypp/repos.d # zypper refresh
Repository 'SLES12-12-0' is up to date.
Repository 'SLES12-Pool' is up to date.
Repository 'SLES12-Updates' is up to date.

```

When prompted for a User Name and Password, provide your connection credentials for the EnterpriseDB repository. If you need credentials, visit the following website:

Before installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server or supporting components, you must also add SUSEConnect and the SUSE Package Hub extension to the SLES host, and register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories. Use the commands:

```text
zypper install SUSEConnect
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12/x86_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12/x86_64
```

For detailed information about registering a SUSE host, visit:

Then add the Java repository and update the repository metadata: Please note that only OpenJDK (version 1.8) is supported on SLES hosts of Java components. Before using an RPM installer to add Advanced Server or a supporting component that requires Java, use zypper to add supporting repository locations to your system.

Use the commands:

```text
zypper addrepo "http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Java:/Factory/SLE_12_SP2/Java:Factory.repo"
zypper addrepo "http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/Kolab:/3.3/SLE_12/server:Kolab:3.3.repo"
zypper refresh
```

Then, you can use the zypper utility to install the xDB Replication Server components:

`zypper install ppas-xdb*`

!!! Note
    Before starting the publication server and subscription server, the `/etc/hosts` file must contain an entry for the host name that associates it to the host IP address as shown by the following example where `192.168.187.133` is the IP address and `linux-dm8s` is the host name:

```text
192.168.187.133              linux-dm8s
```
