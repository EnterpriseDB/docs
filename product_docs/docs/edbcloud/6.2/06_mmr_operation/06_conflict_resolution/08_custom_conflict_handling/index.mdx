<div id="custom_conflict_handling" class="registered_link"></div>

For `update/update` conflicts, custom conflict handling utilizes a PL/pgSQL function to resolve the conflict. If you are using Advanced Server, a Stored Procedure Language (SPL) function can be used as well. When an update/update conflict is detected the function is called. How you set a certain parameter in the function determines the outcome of the conflict.

You must provide the function and add it to the primary definition node using a utility such as PSQL or pgAdmin (Postgres Enterprise Manager Client in Advanced Server).
