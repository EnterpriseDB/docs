Manual conflict resolution typically requires modification of rows in one or more publication tables to correct erroneous entries. Such changes can be done using a utility such as `PSQL` or `pgAdmin` (Postgres Enterprise Manager Client in Advanced Server).

Manual publication table corrections must usually be isolated â€“ that is, these modifications must be limited to the publication tables you are directly changing and must not be replicated to the other primary nodes as would normally occur in the multi-master replication system.

To prevent the xDB Replication Server from replicating changes to one or more publication tables during a synchronization operation, the changes to the publication tables must be made within a transaction block that includes a reference to an xDB control schema table. This reference to the xDB control schema table causes the xDB Replication Server to skip the transaction block when performing a synchronization replication.

!!! Note
    Not every xDB control schema table prevents this replication of a transaction block. Use the `SQL UPDATE` statement as shown by the following.

The `SQL UPDATE` statement shown in the following transaction block is to be included to prevent replication of other publication table changes appearing within the same transaction block:

```text
BEGIN;
UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_properties SET value = current_timestamp WHERE key = 'last_mcr_timestamp';

One or more SQL statements to correct publication tables

END;
```

When such a transaction block is executed within a primary node, the insert, update, or deletion of rows to any publication table within the transaction block are not replicated to any other primary node by the xDB Replication Server when the next synchronization replication occurs.

As many such transaction blocks can be run on any primary node as necessary to change the publication table rows to resolve the conflicts. The resulting changes are isolated to the primary node on which the transaction block is run, so each primary node can be independently corrected.
