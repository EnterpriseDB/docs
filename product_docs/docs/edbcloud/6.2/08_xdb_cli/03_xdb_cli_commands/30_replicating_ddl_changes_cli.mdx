The `replicateddl` command applies an `ALTER TABLE` statement to a publication table in all databases of a replication system as well as updates the xDB Replication Server insert/update/delete triggers and shadow table associated with that publication table.

Synopsis

```text
-replicateddl pubname
  â€“repsvrfile pubsvrfile
  -table schema_t.table_name
  -ddlscriptfile script_file
```

See [Replicating DDL Changes](../../07_common_operations/08_replicating_ddl_changes/#replicating_ddl_changes) for additional information on DDL change replication.

Parameters

`pubname`

> The name of the publication containing the table to which the `ALTER TABLE` statement is to be applied.

`pubsvrfile`

> The file containing the publication server login information.

`schema_t`

> The name of the schema containing `table_name`. This value is case-sensitive.

`table_name`

> The name of the table in the `ALTER TABLE` statement whose definition is to be modified. This value is case-sensitive.

`script_file`

> Path to the file containing the `ALTER TABLE` statements.

Examples

The following example shows the addition of a column named title to table `edb.emp`. The `ALTER TABLE` statement is in the text file `addcolumn.sql` as shown by the following:

```text
ALTER TABLE edb.emp ADD COLUMN title VARCHAR(20);
The replicateddl command is executed using the addcolumn.sql file to update the triggers and shadow tables on the primary nodes:
$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -replicateddl emp_pub \
>   -repsvrfile ~/pubsvrfile.prop \
>   -table edb.emp \
>   -ddlscriptfile ~/addcolumn.sql
DDL changes successfully replicated to all primary nodes.
```
