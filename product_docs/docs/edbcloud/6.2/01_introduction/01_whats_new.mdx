The following features have been added to xDB Replication Server version 6.1 to create xDB Replication Server version 6.2:

> -   Registering your xDB Replication Server product with an EnterpriseDB product license key is no longer required. Thus, all components related to registering the product have been removed. The following are the removed components: 
     - The Product Registration dialog box accessed from the xDB Replication Console Help menu
     - The `license_key` parameter located in the xDB Replication Configuration file
     - The xDB Replication Server CLI `registerkey` command.
> -   Partitioned tables created using the declarative partitioning feature of PostgreSQL and Advanced Server version 10 and later can now be replicated in a log-based single-master or multi-master replication system. For more information, see [Replicating Postgres Partitioned Tables](../07_common_operations/10_replicating_postgres_partitioned_tables/#replicating_postgres_partitioned_tables).
> -   In a single-master replication system, removal of a table from a publication that has one or more existing subscriptions is now permitted as long as the table to be removed is not the parent referenced in a foreign key constraint from a child table that is not being removed as well. Previously, no tables from a publication in a single-master replication system could be removed if there are existing subscriptions. For more information, see [Removing Tables from a Publication](../07_common_operations/06_managing_publication/03_updating_pub/#remove_tables_from_pub).
