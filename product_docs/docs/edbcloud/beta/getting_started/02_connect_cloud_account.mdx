This topic describes how to set up your EDB Cloud account on Azure Marketplace. Your Azure subscription for EDB Cloud is where you create and manage Postgres clusters.

## Before You Connect Your Cloud Account

1. Ensure you have an active Microsoft Azure subscription. If you need to create one, see [Create an additional Azure subscription](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscription).

1. Within Azure Active Directory, ensure your role is owner and your user type is member (not guest) for the subscription you are using.

1. Create an Azure Active Directory Application client to delegate Identity and Access Management functions to Azure Active Directory (AD).

!!! Note
    Some steps of the subscription process require approval of an Azure AD global administrator.
    Your Azure role must be global administrator or you need the cooperation of a Azure AD global administrator in your organization.

### Create Azure Active Directory Application

!!! Note
    Create your Azure AD Application in the same tenant as the subscription you want it associated with.Â 

To create an Azure AD Application:

1. Register an application with Azure AD and create a service principal. See [Register an application with Azure AD and create a service principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#register-an-application-with-azure-ad-and-create-a-service-principal) for instructions.
Take note of the **Application (client) ID**, you need it to configure your EDB cloud account. Also take note of the **Display name** of the Azure AD application. You need to enter the **Display name** _as is_ in the next step of this procedure.

1. Choose _application secret_ as an authentication option for the application. See [Create a new Azure AD application secret](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#option-2-create-a-new-application-secret) for instructions. Take note of the Azure AD App Secret, you need it to configure your cloud account.
1. Assign the owner role to the application. See [Assign a role to the application](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#assign-a-role-to-the-application) for instructions. Enter the **Display name** of the Azure AD application in the **Select** field of the **Add role assignment** panel. See [Open the Add role assignment pane](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal?tabs=current#step-2-open-the-add-role-assignment-pane) for instructions.
