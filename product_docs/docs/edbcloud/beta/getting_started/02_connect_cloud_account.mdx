This topic describes how to set up your EDB Cloud account on Azure Marketplace. Your Azure subscription for EDB Cloud is where you can create and manage Postgres clusters.

## Before You Connect Your Cloud Account

1. Ensure you have an active Microsoft Azure subscription. Refer to these [instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscription) if you need to create a Azure subscription.

1. Create an Azure Active Directory Application client to delegate Identity and Access Management functions to Azure Active Directory (AD).



### Create Azure Active Directory Application

!!! Note
    Create your Azure AD Application in the same tenant as the subscription you want it associated with.Â 

To create an Azure AD Application:

1. Register an application with Azure AD and create a service principal using [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#register-an-application-with-azure-ad-and-create-a-service-principal).
Take note of the **Application (client) ID**, you need it to configure your EDB cloud account. Also take note of the **Display name** of the Azure AD application. You need to enter the **Display name** _as is_ in the next step of this procedure.

1. Choose _application secret_ as an authentication option for the application. [Create a new Azure AD application secret. ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#option-2-create-a-new-application-secret) Take note of the Azure AD App Secret, you need it to configure your cloud account.
1. Assign _Owner_ role to the application as described [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#assign-a-role-to-the-application). Enter the **Display name** of the Azure AD application in the **Select** field of the [**Add role assignment** panel](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal?tabs=current#step-2-open-the-add-role-assignment-pane) panel.
