title: "Creating a Cluster"
---
To create a cluster:
1. Sign in to the [EDB Cloud portal](https://portal.edbcloud.com).
2. Select the **Create New Cluster** button in the top right of the **Overview** page or **Clusters** page.
3. Enter a **Cluster Name** for your cluster.
4. Enter a **Password** for your cluster.
   !!! Note
       This is the password for the superuser 'edb_admin'.
5. Select the **Postgres Type**.
   - *PostgreSQL* is an open-source object-relational database management system.
   - *EDB Postgres Advanced Server* is EDB’s secure, Oracle-compatible PostgreSQL.
6. Select the **Version** that you want to run your cluster on. Please refer to our versioning policy for more information.
7. Select the **Provider** for your cluster.
   !!! Note
       Microsoft Azure is the only option for the preview.
8. Select the **Region** where you want your cluster to be deployed. For the best performance, EDB typically recommends that this region should be the same as other resources you have that communicate with your cluster.
9. Deselect **High Availability** if not desired.
   !!! Note
       When high availability is enabled, clusters are configured with one primary and two replicas with synchronous streaming replication. Clusters are configured across availability zones in regions with availability zones. When high availability is disabled, one instance is provisioned.
10. Select the **Instance Type** based on the number of vCPUs and amount of memory desired.
11. Select the **Storage** type and amount of storage needed for your cluster.
   !!! Note
       Azure premium storage is the only option.
12. (Steps 12-15 are optional) Select **Advanced Customization** to open more options for your cluster.
13. Under **Number of Connections**, type or use the arrows to enter the desired amount of connections between your cluster and other applications. The default number of connections is 100.
14. Select **Networking** to enable private networking, which allows only IP addresses within your private network to connect to your cluster. By default, your networking is set to Private, which allows only IP addresses within your private network to connect to your cluster.
15. Select **Create Cluster**. It might take a few minutes to deploy.
