title: "Creating a Cluster"

<h3>First Steps</h3>

1. Sign into the [EDB Cloud portal](https://portal.edbcloud.com).
!!! Note
    You must have Owner account privileges in order to create your own cluster. If you have Contributor or Reader account privileges and need to create a cloud, contact the account owner.

2. Click the **Create New Cluster** button in the top right of the **Overview** page or **Clusters** page.
3. Enter a name and password for your cluster.

<h3>Configure Your Cluster</h3>

4. Under **Database Type**, select a type of database.
 - **PostgreSQL** is an open-source object-relational database management system. Choosing this option will build your cloud on a Postgres engine.
 - **EnterpriseDB PostgreSQL Advanced Server (EPAS)** is EDB’s secure, Oracle-compatible server built on top of Postgres. If your organization already uses EPAS.
5. Select the version that you want to run your cluster on. Please refer to our versioning policy for more information.
6. Under **Provider**, select a cloud provider for your cluster.
   !!! Note
       For EDB Cloud Preview, the only cloud provider we support is Microsoft Azure.
7. Under **Region**, select the region in which you want your cluster to be deployed. For the best performance, we typically recommend that this region should be the same as other resources you have that will communicate with your cluster.
   !!! Note
       Zone-redundant High Availability is on by default. EDB Cloud provides built-in high availability aimed to reduce downtime in the event of a zone or instance becoming unavailable. Each cluster is provisioned with 3 instances, 1 primary and 2 standby instances, within a single region.
8. Under **Instance Type**, select the desired instance based on the number of vCPUs and amount of memory offered.
9. Under **Storage**, select the type and amount of storage needed for your cluster.
10. Under **Profile**, select the database use that best applies to your cluster.
- **OLAP** (Online Analytical Processing) is used for analysis on large amounts of data, such as complex querying or data mining.
- **OLTP** (Online Transactional Processing) is used for updating large amounts of data in real time, such as logging transactions or password changes.
- **Web** databases are used by web applications and are accessible through a local network or internet connection.

<h3>Advanced Configuration (Optional)</h3>

11. Click on **Advanced Customization** to open more options for your cluster.
12. Under **Number of Connections**, type or use the arrows to enter the desired amount of connections between your cluster and other applications. The default number of connections is 100.
13. Under **Backups**, type or use the arrows to enter the desired number of days you want your data to be retained for backups.
14. Click the toggle under **Networking** to enable private networking, which allows only IP addresses within your private network to connect to your cluster. By default, your networking is set to Public, which means that any client can connect to your cluster’s public IP address over the internet.

<h3>Create Cluster</h3>


15. Click **Create Cluster**. It might take a few minutes to deploy.
