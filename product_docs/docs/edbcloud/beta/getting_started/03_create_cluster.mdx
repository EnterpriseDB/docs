title: "Creating a Cluster"
---
To create a cluster:
1. Sign in to the [EDB Cloud portal](https://portal.edbcloud.com).
2. Select **Create New Cluster** in the top right of the **Overview** page or **Clusters** page.
3. Enter the name for your cluster in the **Cluster Name** field. 
4. Enter a password for your cluster in the **Password** field. This is the password for the superuser 'edb_admin'.
5. In the **Database Type** section,
   1. Select the type of Postgres you want to use in the **Postgres Type** field: 
      - *PostgreSQL* is an open-source object-relational database management system.
      - *EDB Postgres Advanced Server* is EDB’s secure, Oracle-compatible PostgreSQL.
   6. Select the version that you want to run your cluster on in the **Version** field. Refer to our [versioning policy](../overview/05_database_version_policy) for more information.
7. Select the cloud provider for your cluster in the **Provider** field.
   !!! Note
       Microsoft Azure is the only option for the preview.
8. Select the region where you want your cluster to be deployed in the **Region** field. For the best performance, EDB typically recommends that this region should be the same as other resources you have that communicate with your cluster.
9. Enable or disable high availablity using the **High Availability** slide button. High availability is enabled by default. When high availability is enabled, clusters are configured with one primary and two replicas with synchronous streaming replication. Clusters are configured across availability zones in regions with availability zones. When high availability is disabled, one instance is provisioned.
10. In the the **Instance Type** section, select the number of vCPUs and amount of memory you desire.
11. Select the type and amount of storage needed for your cluster in the **Storage** field.
   !!! Note
       Azure premium storage is the only option for the Preview.
12. (Optional) Expand the **Advanced Customization** section, to specify:
     1. The desired amount of connections between your cluster and other applications. You can either enter the amount or use the arrows. The default is 100.
     2. The desired number of days you want your data to be retained for backups. You can either enter the amount or use the arrows. The default is 100.
     3. Whether to use private or public networking using the **Networking** slide button. Networking is set to Private by default. Private networking allows only IP addresses within your private network to connect to your cluster. Public means that any client can connect to your cluster’s public IP address over the internet.
17. Select **Create Cluster**. It might take a few minutes to deploy.
