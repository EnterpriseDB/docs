title: Raising Azure Resource Limits
---

By default, Azure sets a very low limit on the number of Virtual Machines per region and on the number of Public IP addresses per region that are available in a given subscription. 

The default Azure Virtual Machine limit per region is set to 20. See [Azure Virtual Machine  limit per region](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#virtual-machines-limits---azure-resource-manager) for more information. You need to increase this limit to at least 50 Virtual Machines per region. EDB Cloud uses ESv3 Series Virtual Machines. 

The default Public IP address limits to Public IP Addresses Basic and Public IP Addresses Standards is set to 10. See [Public IP address limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#publicip-address) for more information. You need to increase the limit of `Public IP Addresses - Basic` and `Public IP Addresses - Standard` to 100 for the regions where you plan to deploy your EDB clusters.

# Checking Current Utilization

To check if you have adequate Azure resources to provision new clusters:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Subscription**.

1. Select your specific subscription.
2. Select **Usage + quotas** in the **Settings** section.
1. Search for "ESv3" to view virtual machines limits.
1. Search for Public IP to view networks limits.


# Increasing Network Quota

You can increase the number of public IP addresses for your account either by using Azure's portal if you have appropriate privileges or by submitting a support request. See:

# Increasing Virtual Machine Quota

You can increase the number of ESv3 Series virtual machines per region for your account either by using Azure's portal if you have appropriate privileges or by submitting a support request. See:
