title: Checking Azure Resource Limits
---

By default, Azure sets a very low limit on the number of virtual machines per region and on the number of Public IP Addresses per region that are available in a given subscription. 

The default [Azure Virtual Machine  limit per region](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#virtual-machines-limits---azure-resource-manager) is set to 20. You need to increase this limit to at least 50 virtual machines per region. EDB Cloud uses ESv3 Series virtual machines. 

The default [Public IP address limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#publicip-address) to Public IP Addresses Basic and Public IP Addresses Standards is set to 10. You need to increase the limit of `Public IP Addresses - Basic` and `Public IP Addresses - Standard` to 100 for the regions where you plan to deploy your EDB Cloud Postgres clusters.

# Checking Current Utilization

To check if you have adequate Azure resources to provision new clusters:

1. In the Azure Portal, select **Subscription**.

1. Select your specific subscription.
2. Select Settings > **Usage + quotas**.
1. Search for "ESv3" to view virtual machines limits.
1. Search for Public IP to view networks limits.


# Increasing Network Quota

You can increase the number of public IP addresses for your account either by using Azure's portal if you have appropriate privileges or by submitting a support request. See:
