title: Raising Azure Resource Limits
---

By default, Azure sets a very low limit on the number of virtual machines and cores per region and on the number of Public IP Addresses per region that are available in a given subscription. 

The default number of [total cores per subscription per region](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#virtual-machines-limits---azure-resource-manager) is 20. You need to increase the total cores to account for the total number of cores you expect to use in each region and reserve these cores to be used by EDB. As an example, if you provision the largest virtual machine with high availability this would be 192 cores per region. EDB uses 8 DSv2 virtual machine cores for managing your environment."

The default [Public IP address limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#publicip-address) for Public IP Addresses Basic and Public IP Addresses Standards is set to 10. You need to increase the limit of `Public IP Addresses - Basic` and `Public IP Addresses - Standard` for the regions where you plan to deploy your EDB clusters with the total number of EDB clusters you plan to use.


# Checking Current Utilization

To check if you have adequate Azure resources to provision new clusters:

1. In the Azure Portal, select **Subscription**.

2. Select your specific subscription.
3. Select Settings > **Usage + quotas**.
4. Search for "Total Regional vCPUs" and select the **Location** to check the regional vCPUs limits.
5. Search for "DSv2" and "ESv3" to view virtual machines limits.
6. Search for Public IP to view networks limits.


# Increasing Network Quota

You can increase the number of public IP addresses for your account either by using Azure's portal if you have appropriate privileges or by submitting a support request. See:

- [Request networking quota increase at subscription level using usages + quotas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/networking-quota-requests#request-networking-quota-increase-at-subscription-level-using-usages--quotas)


# Increasing Virtual Machine Quota

You can increase the number of ESv3 Series virtual machines per region for your account either by using Azure's portal if you have appropriate privileges or by submitting a support request. See:

- [Request a quota increase by region from Help + support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/regional-quota-requests#request-a-quota-increase-by-region-from-help--support)
