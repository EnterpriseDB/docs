title: Raising Azure Resource Limits
---

By default, Azure sets a very low limit on the number of virtual machines and cores per region and on the number of Public IP Addresses per region that are available in a given subscription.

The default number of total cores per subscription per region is 20. See [Virtual Machines limits - Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#virtual-machines-limits---azure-resource-manager) for more information. You need to increase the total cores to account for the total number of cores you expect to use in each region and reserve these cores to be used by EDB. See the next section [Virtual Machine Quota Requirements](#virtual-machine-quota-requirements)for more information.

The default Public IP address limits for Public IP Addresses Basic and Public IP Addresses Standards is set to 10. See [Public IP address limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#publicip-address) for more information. You need to increase the limit of `Public IP Addresses - Basic` and `Public IP Addresses - Standard` for the regions where you plan to deploy your EDB clusters with the total number of EDB clusters you plan to use.

## Virtual Machine Quota Requirements
In each region, EDB Cloud uses six ESv3 and six DSv2 virtual machine cores to manage your EDB Cloud infrastructure.
Your Postgres clusters deployed in the region use separate ESv3 virtual machine cores.
The number of cores depends on the Instance Type and High Availability options of the clusters you provision. You can calculate the number of ESv3 cores required for your cluster based on the following:

* Virtual machine instance of type E{N}Sv3 uses {N} cores. For example, an instance of type E64Sv3 uses 64 ESv3 cores.
* Cluster running on an E{N}Sv3 instance with high availability not enabled uses exactly {N} ESv3 cores.
* Cluster running on an E{N}Sv3 instance with high availability enabled uses 3 * {N} ESv3 cores.

As an example, if you provision the largest virtual machine E64Sv3 with high availability enabled, it requires (3 * 64)=192 ESv3 cores per region. EDB Cloud infrastructure requires an additional six ESv3 and six DSv2 virtual machine cores per region.

## Checking Current Utilization

To check if you have adequate Azure resources to provision new clusters:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), select **Subscription**.
2. Select your specific subscription.
3. Select **Usage + quotas** in the **Settings** section.
4. Search for "Total Regional vCPUs" and select the **Location** to check the regional vCPUs limits.
5. Search for "DSv2" and "ESv3" to view virtual machines limits.
6. Search for Public IP to view networks limits.


## Increasing Network Quota

You can increase the number of public IP addresses for your account either by using Azure's portal if you have appropriate privileges or by submitting a support request. See:

- [Request Networking quota increase at subscription level using Help + support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/networking-quota-requests#request-networking-quota-increase-at-subscription-level-using-help--support)

- [Request networking quota increase at subscription level using Usages + quotas](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/networking-quota-requests#request-networking-quota-increase-at-subscription-level-using-usages--quotas)


## Increasing Virtual Machine Quota

You can increase the number of ESv3 Series virtual machines per region for your account either by using Azure's portal if you have appropriate privileges or by submitting a support request. See:

- [Request a quota increase by region from Help + support](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/regional-quota-requests#request-a-quota-increase-by-region-from-help--support)
