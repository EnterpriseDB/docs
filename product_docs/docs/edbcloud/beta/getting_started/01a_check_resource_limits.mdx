title: Checking Your Azure Resource Limits
---

By default, Azure sets a very low limit on the number of virtual machines per region and on the number of Public IP Addresses per region that are available in a given subscription. 

The default [Azure Virtual Machine  limit per region](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#virtual-machines-limits---azure-resource-manager) is set to 20. You need to increase this limit to at least 50 virtual machines per region. EDB Cloud uses ESv3 Series virtual machines. 

The default [Public IP address limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#publicip-address) to Public IP Addresses Basic and Public IP Addresses Standards is set to 10. You need to increase the limit of `Public IP Addresses - Basic` and `Public IP Addresses - Standard` to 100 for the regions where you plan to deploy your EDB Cloud Postgres clusters.

To check the current Azure limits for virtual machines and public IP addresses:

1. In the Azure Portal, select **Subscription**.

1. Select your specific subscription.
2. Select Settings > **Usage + quotas**.
1. Search for "ESv3" to view virtual machines limits.
1. Search for Public IP to view networks limits.


If your role is [Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner), [Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#contributor), or [Support Request Contributor](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#support-request-contributor) for your Azure account, you can send requests to increase those limits. Please ensure that the *Default subscription filter* is updated for the expected *subscription id*.

Follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/per-vm-quota-requests#request-a-standard-quota-increase-from-help--support) to increase your ESv3 Series virtual machines limits for the regions where you are planning to deploy your EDB Cloud Postgres clusters. This is an example of a request to increase virtual machines limits:

```sh
Request Summary / New Limit:
Resource Manager, EASTUS, ESv3 Series / 50
Resource Manager, UKSOUTH, ESv3 Series / 50
```

To make requests to increase Azure Networking Limits follow [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-portal/supportability/networking-quota-requests#request-networking-quota-increase-at-subscription-level-using-help--support).

If you have subscription-level permissions, you can use [these instructions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/how-to-manage-quotas) to directly manage your Azure quotas.
