This topic shows you how to set up  UPM Cloud subscription on Azure Marketplace.

## Prerequisites

EDB Cloud account setup depends on three Azure objects:
1. _Azure Subscription_ - to connect to Azure.

2. [Azure Active Directory (AD) Application ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#register-an-application-with-azure-ad-and-create-a-service-principal) -  to create Azure AD Service principal that provides identity to your organization.

3. [Azure Resource Group ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal#what-is-a-resource-group)- to identify the region and resources to be used by EDB Cloud.

Ensure that you have an Azure subscription. Secondly, use the  instructions in the following link to create [Azure Active Directory (AD) Application and a Service Principal](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/howto-create-service-principal-portal#register-an-application-with-azure-ad-and-create-a-service-principal). The Azure AD app should have a _Contributor_ role. As an authentication option for the application, choose _application secret. _Thirdly, create [Azure Resource Group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal#what-is-a-resource-group). The later can also be created during the subscription. The following table describes the parameters   that need to be entered in EDB Cloud subscription form. All, but last one are properties of Azure objects.


<table>

        <td><strong>Parameter</strong>

    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Azure Subscription ID</strong>
        </td>
        <td>Azure Subscription
        </td>
        <td>Directory (tenant) ID
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><strong>Azure Resource Group</strong>
        </td>
        <td>Azure Resource Group
        </td>
        <td>Name you assign
        </td>

        <td>Your EDB Cloud Organization Name
        </td>
        <td> NA
        </td>
