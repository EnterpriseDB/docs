title: "High Availability"
---

EDB provides optional high availability aimed to reduce downtime in the event of a zone or instance becoming unavailable. High availability clusters are configured with one _primary_ and two _replicas_ with synchronous streaming replication. Clusters are configured across availability zones in regions with availability zones.

* Replicas are usually called _standby servers_ and can also be used for read-only workloads.
* In case of temporary or permanent unavailability of the leader, a standby replica will become the primary.
