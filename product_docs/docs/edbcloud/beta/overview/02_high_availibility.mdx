title: "High Availability"
---

EDB Cloud provides built-in high availability aimed to reduce downtime in the event of a zone or instance becoming unavailable.
An EDB Cloud _cluster_ is a PostgreSQL cluster made up of a single _primary_ and an optional number of _replicas_.
Streaming replication is used to ensure that the primary and replicas have the same data.


* The primary cluster is often called the _leader_.
* Replicas are usually called _standby servers_ and can also be used for read-only workloads.
* In case of temporary or permanent unavailability of the primary, a standby server will become the leader.

EDB Cloud clusters with the _High Availability_ option enabled have the following configuration:

* Each cluster is provisioned with 3 instances - 1 primary and 2 standby servers, within a single region.
* Clusters are configured across availability zones in regions with availability zones.
* Streaming replication is used.
