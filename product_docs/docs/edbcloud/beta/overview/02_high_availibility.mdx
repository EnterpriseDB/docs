EDB Cloud enables deploying a cluster with or without High Availability. The option is presented as a High Availablity on/off toggle button on the Create Cluster page in the EDB Cloud Portal. To view your cluster's current High Availability setting, navigate to your Cluster from the Clusters page in the EDB Cloud Portal and view whether High Availability is listed as Enabled or Not Enabled under Cluster Info. To modify the High Availability setting of a cluster, click on the Edit cluster button on the Cluster Info section of your cluster. From there, the High Availability toggle can be switched on/off.  

## High Availability - Enabled

The high availability option is provided to minimize downtime in cases of failures. High Availability clusters are configured automatically with - one _primary_ and two _replicas_ - with replicas staying up-to-date through physical streaming replication. In cloud regions with availability zones, clusters are provisioned across multiple availability zones to provide fault tolerance in the face of a datacenter failure


* Replicas are usually called _standby servers_ and can also be used for read-only workloads.
* In case of temporary or permanent unavailability of the primary, a standby replica will become the primary.

Incoming client connections are always routed to the current primary. In case of failure of the primary, a standby replica will automatically be promoted to primary and new connections will be routed to the new primary. When the old primary recovers, it will re-join the cluster as a replica.

By default, one replica must confirm that a transaction record was written to disk before the client receives acknowledgment of a successful commit - in PostgreSQL terms, `synchronous_commit` is set to `on` and `synchronous_standby_names` is set to `ANY 1 (replica-1, replica-2)`. This behavior can be modified on a per-transaction, per-session, per-user, or per-database basis with appropriate `SET` or `ALTER` commands.

## High Availability - Not Enabled

For non-production use cases where high availability is not a primary concern, a cluster deployment with high availability not enabled provides one _primary_ with no _standby servers_ for failover or read-only workloads. 

* In case of permanent unavailability of the primary, a restore from a backup is required.
