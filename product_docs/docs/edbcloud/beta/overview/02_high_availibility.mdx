title: "High Availability"
---

EDB provides optional high availability to minimize downtime in case of failures. High availability clusters are configured with three database instances - one _primary_ and two _replicas_ - with streaming replication from the primary to the replicas. In cloud regions with availability zones, instances are provisioned across multiple availability zones to provide fault tolerance in the face of datacenter failure.


* Replicas are usually called _standby servers_ and can also be used for read-only workloads.
* In case of temporary or permanent unavailability of the leader, a standby replica will become the primary.

Incoming client connections are always routed to the current primary. In case of failure of the primary, a standby replica will automatically be promoted to primary and new connections will be routed to the new primary. When the old primary recovers, it will re-join the cluster as a secondary.

By default, transactions must synchronously commit to one replica before acknowledgement - in PostgreSQL terms, `synchronous_commit` is set to `on` and `synchronous_standby_names` is set to `ANY 1 (replica-1, replica-2)`. Customers can modify this behavior on a per-transaction, per-session, per-user, or per-database basis with appropriate `SET` or `ALTER` commands.
