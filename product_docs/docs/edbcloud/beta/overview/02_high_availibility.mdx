EDB Cloud enables deploying a cluster with or without high availability. The option is controlled with the **High Availablity** slide button on the [Create Cluster](https://portal.edbcloud.com/create-cluster) page in the [EDB Cloud](https://portal.edbcloud.com) portal.    

## High Availability - Enabled

The high availability option is provided to minimize downtime in cases of failures. High Availability clusters are configured automatically with - one _primary_ and two _replicas_ - with replicas staying up-to-date through physical streaming replication. In cloud regions with availability zones, clusters are provisioned across multiple availability zones to provide fault tolerance in the face of a datacenter failure


* Replicas are usually called _standby servers_ and can also be used for read-only workloads.
* In case of temporary or permanent unavailability of the primary, a standby replica will become the primary.

Incoming client connections are always routed to the current primary. In case of failure of the primary, a standby replica will automatically be promoted to primary and new connections will be routed to the new primary. When the old primary recovers, it will re-join the cluster as a replica.

By default, one replica must confirm that a transaction record was written to disk before the client receives acknowledgment of a successful commit - in PostgreSQL terms, `synchronous_commit` is set to `on` and `synchronous_standby_names` is set to `ANY 1 (replica-1, replica-2)`. This behavior can be modified on a per-transaction, per-session, per-user, or per-database basis with appropriate `SET` or `ALTER` commands.

## High Availability - Not Enabled

For non-production use cases where high availability is not a primary concern, a cluster deployment with high availability not enabled provides one primary with no standby servers for failover or read-only workloads. 

In case of permanent unavailability of the primary, a restore from a backup is required.
