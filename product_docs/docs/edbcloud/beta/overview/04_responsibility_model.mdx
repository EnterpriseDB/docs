Security and confidentiality is a shared responsibility between you and EDB. EDB provides a secure platform that enables you to create and maintain secure database clusters deployed on EDB Cloud. You have numerous responsibilities around the security of your clusters and data held within them. 

Reference and link out to Terms

The following Responsibility Model describes the distribution of specific responsibilities between you and EDB.


## Planning and Operations Management


| Task  | EDB Responsibility  | Your Responsibility  |
| ----- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Cloud infrastructure availability:** compute and network resources are operating properly - including performance - and can be scaled / reconfigured as necessary. | Yes  | No  |
| **Database service availability:** customers can connect to a database cluster and read / write data.  | Yes  | Yes  |
| **Planning database performance:** data modeling and query performance that meets your business needs.  | No  | Yes  |
| **Database cluster capacity planning:** the database clusters deployed on the platform are allocated sufficient resources (CPU/RAM/disk) to achieve acceptable performance. Disk space is monitored for exhaustion.  | No  | Yes  |
| **Database cluster backups:** database clusters are configured to back up data at intervals that meet your recovery point objective.  | No  | Yes  |
| **Database cluster backups:** data in database clusters is backed up and made available for restore in a timely manner consistent with the configuration of the database cluster.  | Yes  | No  |
| **Database cluster backups:** database backups can be restored in a timely fashion consistent with your recovery time objective.  | No  | Yes  |




## Security and Compliance



| Task  | EDB Responsibility  | Your Responsibility  |
| ----- | ------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **Database cluster credential management:** credentials for database clusters are kept secret and rotated as appropriate.  | Yes  | Yes  |
| **Encryption of customer data at-rest:** Data stored in database clusters is encrypted appropriately.  |  Configuring encryption with appropriate keys  | No  |
| **Vulnerability management:** operating system kernels and packages on computers hosting customer database clusters and the control plane are kept up-to-date in accordance with policy.  | Yes  | No  |
| **Vulnerability management:** database software is kept up-to-date in accordance with policy.  | Yes  | No  |
| **Network security:** firewalls are configured to appropriately restrict east / west network traffic.  | Yes  | No  |
| **Network security:** firewalls are configured to appropriately restrict north / south network traffic.  | Given a customer's network ingress configuration, EDB is responsible for implementing the correct set of firewall rules.  | You must configure network ingress policies via the EDB Cloud API to allow traffic only from appropriate sources.  |
