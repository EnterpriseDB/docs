| **Database service availability:** customers can connect to a database cluster and read / write data  | Yes  | Yes  |
| **Planning database schema:** database query performance is acceptable for the customer's business needs.  | No  | Yes  |
| **Database cluster capacity planning:** the database clusters deployed on the platform are allocated sufficient resources (CPU/RAM/disk) to achieve acceptable performance. Disk space is monitored for exhaustion.  | No  | Yes  |
| **Database cluster backups:** database clusters are configured to back up data at intervals that meet the customer's recovery point objective.  | No  | Yes  |
| **Database cluster backups:** data in database clusters is backed up and made available for restore in a timely manner consistent with the configuration of the database cluster.  | Yes  | No  |

| **Vulnerability management:** operating system kernels and packages on computers hosting customer database clusters and the control plane are kept up-to-date in accordance with policy.  | Yes  | No  |
| **Vulnerability management:** database software is kept up-to-date in accordance with policy.  | Yes  | No  |
