Versions Supported:

- PostgreSQL versions supported: 10, 11, 12

- EDB Postgres Advanced versions supported: 10, 11, 12

Maintenance and upgrades:

- EDB is committed to providing stable, up-to-date versions. We test, evaluate, and release new versions to clusters.

- Major Version Upgrades: Major versions are supported from the date they are made available until the version is retired from the PostgreSQL community (for PostgreSQL) or until EDB retires a major version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

- Minor Version Upgrades & Maintenance: Minor version and patch updates are handled automatically and are not user configurable.
