| **Postgres Type**  | **Major Versions**  | 
| ----- | ------------------------- |
| PostgreSQL  | 11 - 13  |

## Major Version Support

PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server major versions are supported from the date they are made available until the version is retired by EDB (generally 5 years). See [Platform Compatibility ](https://www.enterprisedb.com/product-compatibility#epas) for more details.



## Minor Version Support

EDB performs periodic maintenance to ensure stability and security. EDB automatically performs minor version upgrades and patch updates as part of periodic maintenance. Customers are notified within the EDB Cloud portal prior to maintenance occurring. Minor versions are not user configurable. 

EDB reserves the right to upgrade customers to the latest minor version without prior notice in an extraordinary circumstance.
