EDB's cloud offering runs in your own cloud account, isolates your data from other users, and gives you control over our access to it. The key security features are:
- **Data Isolation:** Clusters are installed and managed in your own cloud environment. Complete segregation of your data is ensured.
- **Granular Access Control:** You can use _Single Sign On_ and define your own sets of _Roles_ and _Role Based Access Control_ policies to manage your individual cloud environments.
- **Data Encryption:** Data is encrypted in motion and at rest. All network traffic is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). All data is encrypted when stored in database clusters. Bring your own encryption keys for an additional level of control.
- **Logging and Auditing:** Logging and auditing is supported.

### Shared Responsibility
Security and confidentiality is a shared responsibility between EDB and our customers. EDB provides a secure platform that enables our customers to create and maintain secure database clusters deployed on EDB Cloud. Customers have numerous responsibilities around the security of their clusters and data held within them. See our Responsibility Model for more information.
