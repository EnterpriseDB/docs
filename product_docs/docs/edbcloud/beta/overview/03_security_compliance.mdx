### EDB Cloud Security Features
EDB Cloud is a Database as a Service (DBaaS) which runs in your own Cloud account, isolating your data from other users & giving you control over our access to it. The key security features of EDB Cloud are as follows:
- **Segregation of IT environments:** Customers database clusters are installed and managed in their own cloud environment. Complete segregation of customer's data is ensured.
- **Access Control:** EDB Cloud supports _Single Sign on_ and _Role Based Access Control_ policies. Customers may define their own sets of _Roles_ and  _Role Based Access Control_ policies to manage their individual cloud environments.

- **Data Encryption:** EDB Cloud encrypts customer data in motion and at rest. All network traffic is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). Data stored in database clusters is encrypted appropriately. Users can bring their own encryption keys for an additional level of control.
- **Logging and Auditing:** EDB Cloud supports Logging and Auditing

### Shared Responsibility
Security and confidentiality is a shared responsibility between EDB and our customers. EDB provides a secure platform that enables our customers to create and maintain secure database clusters deployed on EDB Cloud.
