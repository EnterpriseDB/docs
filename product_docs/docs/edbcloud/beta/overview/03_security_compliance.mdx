### Overview
EDB's cloud offering runs in your own cloud account, isolating your data from other users and giving you control over our access to it. The key security features are:
- **Segregation of IT environments:** Customer's database clusters are installed and managed in their own cloud environment. Complete segregation of customer's data is ensured.
- **Access Control:** Customers may use _Single Sign On_ and define their own sets of _Roles_ and _Role Based Access Control_ policies to manage their individual cloud environments.
- **Data Encryption:** Customer's data is encrypted in motion and at rest. All network traffic is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS). Data stored in database clusters is encrypted appropriately. Users can bring their own encryption keys for an additional level of control.
- **Logging and Auditing:** Logging and auditing is supported.

### Shared Responsibility
Security and confidentiality is a shared responsibility between EDB and our customers. EDB provides a secure platform that enables our customers to create and maintain secure database clusters deployed on EDB Cloud. Customers have numerous responsibilities around the security of their clusters and data held within them. See our Responsibility Model for more information.
