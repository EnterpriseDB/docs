title: "Pricing and billing "
---

This section covers the pricing breakdown for EDB Cloud as well as how to view invoices and infrastructure usage through Microsoft Azure.

## Pricing
Pricing is based on the number of Virtual Central Processing Units (vCPUs) provisioned for the database software offering. Consumption of vCPUs is metered hourly. A deployment is comprised of either one instance or one primary and two replica instances of either PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server. When high availability is enabled, the number of vCPU per instance should be multiplied by three to calculate the full price for all resources used. See the full cost breakdown below:

| Database type         | Hourly price   | Monthly price* |
| --------------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| PostgreSQL            | $0.1655 / vCPU | $120.82 / vCPU |
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server | $0.2397 / vCPU | $174.98 / vCPU |

*The monthly cost is approximate and assumes 730 hours in a month. Microsoft bills on actual hours in a given month. 

## Billing
All billing is handled directly by Microsoft Azure. Invoices and usage can be viewed on the Azure Portal billing page. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/)

## Cloud infrastructure costs
EDB does not bill you for cloud infrastructure such as compute, storage, data transfer, monitoring, and logging. EDB Cloud clusters run in your Microsoft Azure account. Azure bills you directly for the cloud infrastructure provisioned according to the terms of your account agreement. Invoices and usage can be viewed on the Azure Portal billing page.
