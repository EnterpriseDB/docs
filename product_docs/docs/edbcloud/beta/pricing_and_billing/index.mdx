title: "Pricing and Billing "

## Pricing
Pricing is based on the database software distribution and the number of Virtual Central Processing Units (vCPUs) provisioned, and is metered hourly. A deployment is comprised of either one instance or one primary and two replica instances of either PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server. When high availability is enabled, the number of vCPU per instance should be multiplied by 3 to calculate the full price for all resources used. See the full cost breakdown below:

| Database Type         | Hourly Price   | Monthly Price* |
| --------------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| PostgreSQL            | $0.1655 / vCPU | $120.82 / vCPU |
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server | $0.2397 / vCPU | $174.98 / vCPU |

*The monthly cost is approximate and assumes 730 hours in a month. 

## Billing
All billing is handled directly by Microsoft Azure. Invoices and usage can be viewed on the Azure Portal billing page. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/)

## Cloud Infrastructure Costs
EDB does not bill you for cloud infrastructure such as compute, storage, data transfer, monitoring, and logging. EDB Cloud clusters run out of your Microsoft Azure account, so Azure will handle billing for cloud infrastructure used. Invoices and usage can be viewed on the Azure Portal billing page.
