## Pricing
A default EDB Cloud deployment is one PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server cluster, composed of one leader and two follower instances. Pricing is based on the database type and the number of Virtual Central Processing Units (vCPUs) provisioned, and is metered hourly. Since each cluster has three instances, the price per vCPU should be multiplied by 3 to calculate the full price for all resources used. See the full cost breakdown below:

| Database Type         | Hourly Price   | Monthly Price* |
| --------------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| PostgreSQL            | $0.1655 / vCPU | $120.82 / vCPU |
| EDB Postgres Advanced | $0.2397 / vCPU | $174.98 / vCPU |

*The monthly cost is approximate and assumes 730 hours in a month. 

## Billing
All billing is handled directly by Microsoft Azure. Invoices and usage can be viewed on the Azure Portal billing page. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/)

## Cloud Infrastructure Costs
EDB Cloud does not bill you for cloud infrastructure such as compute, storage, data transfer, monitoring, and logging. EDB Cloud clusters run out of your Microsoft Azure account, so Azure will handle billing for cloud infrastructure used. Invoices and usage can be viewed on the Azure Portal billing page.
