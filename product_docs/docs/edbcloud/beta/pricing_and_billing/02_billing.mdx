How is infrastructure (instances/storage) charged?

EDB Cloud does not bill for cloud infrastructure costs, including compute, storage, data transfer, monitoring, and logging. EDB Cloud clusters run in your own cloud account, and thus infrastructure costs are billed to you by your respective cloud provider(s).
