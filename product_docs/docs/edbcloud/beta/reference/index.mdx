title: API Reference
---

Use the EDB Cloud API to integrate directly with EDB Cloud for management activities such as cluster provisioning, de-provisioning, and scaling.

The API reference documentation is available from the [EDB Cloud portal](https://portal.edbcloud.com). The direct documentation link is [https://portal.edbcloud.com/api/docs/](https://portal.edbcloud.com/api/docs/).

To access the API, you need a token. The EDB Cloud API provides standard OAuth2 Device Code Flow for token access. See [Device Authorization Flow](https://auth0.com/docs/flows/device-authorization-flow) for more information. To complete the device code flow, you need to query the authentication endpoint using this command:

    `curl https://portal.edbcloud.com/api/v1/auth/provider`

The output provides the `clientId`, `issuerUri`, `scope`, and `audience` values that are used in the device code flow.
