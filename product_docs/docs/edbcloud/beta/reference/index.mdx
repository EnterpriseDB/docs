title: Using the EDB Cloud API
---

Use the EDB Cloud API to integrate directly with EDB Cloud for management activities such as cluster provisioning, de-provisioning, and scaling.

The API reference documentation is available from the [EDB Cloud portal](https://portal.edbcloud.com). The direct documentation link is [https://portal.edbcloud.com/api/docs/](https://portal.edbcloud.com/api/docs/).

To access the API, you need a token. This topic dscribes how to obtain a token, how to call the API, and how to renew a token.

## Obtaining a Token

1. Use the following command to get the information returned by the authentication endpoint that you need later in the procedure:

       ```curl https://portal.edbcloud.com/api/v1/auth/provider```
    
    The response returns the `clientId`, `issuerUri`, `scope`, and `audience`. For example:
```
  {
  "clientId": "pM8PRguGtW9yVnrsvrvpaPyyeS9fVvFh",
  "issuerUri": "https://edbcloud.us.auth0.com",
  "scope": "openid profile email offline_access",
  "audience": "https://portal.edbcloud.com/api"
}
```


2. Use the following call to get a device code: 
```
   curl --request POST \
     --url 'https://edbcloud.us.auth0.com/oauth/device/code' \
     --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
     --data 'client_id=pM8PRguGtW9yVnrsvrvpaPyyeS9fVvFh' \
     --data scope='openid profile email offline_access' \
     --data audience='https://portal.edbcloud.com/api'
```

The response returns:

- `device_code` - the unique code for the device. When you go to the `verification_uri` in your browser-based device, this code is bound to your session. You use this code in your request for a token (step 7)).
- `user_code` - the code you input at the `verification_uri` to authorize the device. You use this code in the next step.
- `verification_uri` - the URL you use to authorize your device.
- `verification_uri_complete` - the complete URL you use to authorize the device. You can use this URL to embed the user code in your app's URL.
- `expires_in` indicates the lifetime (in seconds) of the `device_code` and `user_code`.
- `interval` indicates the interval (in seconds) at which the app should poll the token URL to request a token.

For example: 
```
{
  "device_code": "KEOY2_5YjuVsRuIrrR-aq5gs",
  "user_code": "HHHJ-MMSZ",
  "verification_uri": "https://edbcloud.us.auth0.com/activate",
  "expires_in": 900,
  "interval": 5,
  "verification_uri_complete": "https://edbcloud.us.auth0.com/activate?user_code=HHHJ-MMSZ"
}
```


3. Go to the `verification_uri` in your web browser, enter your `user_code`, and select **Continue**.

4. Select **Confirm** on the Device Confirmation dialog.

5. Select **Continue with Microsoft Azure AD** on the EDB Cloud Welcome screen.

6. Log in with your Azure AD credentials.

7. Request the token. For example, 
```
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://edbcloud.us.auth0.com/oauth/token' \
  --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data grant_type=urn:ietf:params:oauth:grant-type:device_code \
  --data device_code=<device_code returned from step 2> \
  --data 'client_id=pM8PRguGtW9yVnrsvrvpaPyyeS9fVvFh'
```
If successful, the call returns:
- `access_token` - use to access the EDB Cloud API. See [Access Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/access-tokens) for more iformation.

- `refresh_token` - use to obtain a new access token or ID token after the previous one has expired. (See [Refresh Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/tokens/refresh-tokens) for more information.) Refresh tokens expire after 30 days.
!!! Note
    Store your refresh token securely so you can use it as needed to get a new access token.  
- `expires_in` - means the token expires after 24 hours since its creation.

For example:
```
{
  "access_token": "eyJhbGc.......1Qtkaw2fyho",
  "id_token": "eyJhbGci.......FBra7tA",
  "refresh_token": "v1.MTvuZpu.......sbiionEhtTw",
  "scope": "openid profile email offline_access",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```


If not successful, you receive one of the following errors:
- `authorization_pending` - continue polling using the suggested interval retrieved in step 2.

- `slow_down` - slow down and use the suggested interval retrieved in step 2. To avoid receiving this error due to network latency, you should start counting each interval after receipt of the last polling request's response.
- `expired_token` - you have not authorized the device quickly enough, so the `device_code` has expired. Your application should notify you that it has expired and to restore it.
- `access_denied` 

Contact [Customer Support](../overview/06_support) if you have trouble obtaining a valid access token to access EDB Cloud API. 

## Calling the API

To call the EDB Cloud API, your application must pass the retrieved access token as a bearer token in the Authorization header of your HTTP request. For example: 

```
curl --request GET \
  --url https://portal.edbcloud.com/api/v1/postgres-types \
  --header 'authorization: Bearer <access_token>  \
  --header 'content-type: application/json'
```

Example response:
```
{
  "pgTypesList": [
    {
      "id": "epas",
      "name": "EDB Postgres Advanced Server",
      "description": "",
      "dockerImage": ""
    },
    {
      "id": "postgres",
      "name": "PostgreSQL",
      "description": "",
      "dockerImage": ""
    }
  ]
}
```


## Refreshing your Token

You can use the refresh token to get a new access token. Usually you need a new access token only after the previous one expires or when gaining access to a new resource for the first time. You shouldn't call the endpoint to get a new access token every time you call an API. There are rate limits that throttle the amount of requests to the endpoint that can be executed using the same token from the same IP. 

To refresh your token, make a POST request to the `/oauth/token` endpoint in the Authentication API, using `grant_type=refresh_token`. For example:

```
curl --request POST \
  --url 'https://edbcloud.us.auth0.com/oauth/token' \
  --header 'content-type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' \
  --data grant_type=refresh_token \
  --data 'client_id=pM8PRguGtW9yVnrsvrvpaPyyeS9fVvFh' \
  --data refresh_token=<your refresh_token>
```

The `refresh_token` is retrieved in step 7 in the previous procedure. 

The `client_id` is always the same one which is retrieved from step 1.

The response of this API call includes the `access_token`. For example:
```
{
  "access_token": "eyJ...MoQ",
  "expires_in": 86400,
  "scope": "openid offline_access",
  "id_token": "eyJ...0NE",
  "refresh_token": "v1.Mjv..._2pRs",
  "token_type": "Bearer"
}
```

!!! Note
    You need to save the `refresh_token` retrieved from this response for the next refresh call. The `refresh_token` received from the step 7 is obsoleted once it has been used.
