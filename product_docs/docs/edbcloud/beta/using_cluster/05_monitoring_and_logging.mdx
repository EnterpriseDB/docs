## Accessing Logs and Metrics

When EDB Cloud deploys workloads on Azure, the workloads applications logs are forwarded to Azure Log Workspace resource.

## Query Log Workspace Tables

To query log workspace content,   go to the Logs menu then you will see 3 tables Groups

 - **ContainerInsights :** Azure native collected Kubernetes logs and metrics, (contains duplicates of some Kube state metrics in Kube* tables)

- **LogManagement :**  Azure native collected logs and metrics around azure resources

- **Custom Logs :** Tables created by the fluentbit containing :

     - our components forwarded logs

     - others specifics Azure resources forwarded  logs

### EDB Container logs
To query the EDB components logs just write this kind of KQL Query from the desired table.

For example, we obtain here the K8S namespace upm-api-provisioning container logs from table MicroservicesLogs_CL.

### Prometheus metrics

To query the Prometheus collected metrics (from omsagent)  just write this kind of KQL Query from the InsightsMetrics table in the Namespace field called prometheus.
