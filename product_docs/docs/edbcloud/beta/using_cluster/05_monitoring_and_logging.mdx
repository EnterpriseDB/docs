## Azure Log Analytics

When EDB Cloud deploys workloads on Azure, the workloads applications logs are forwarded to Azure Log Workspace.
To query EDB Cloud Logs you  need to use [Azure Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview) and [Kusto Query language](https://azure-training.com/azure-data-science/the-kusto-query-language/).



##  Customer Log Analytics Workspace


 All logs from your PostgreSQL clusters are stored in _Customer Log Analytic workspace_.  To find your _Customer Log Analytics workspace_ workspace do the following:

1. Log in to Azure Portal
2. Select Resource Groups section

2. Select the   Resource Group corresponding to the region where you choose to deploy your EDB Cloud. You will see resources included in theat Resource Group

3. Select the resource of type _Log Analytics workspace_ with the suffix -customer

4. Select the Log in the menu on the left

5. Close the dashboard with prebuild queries. This will bring you to KQL Editor.

The following two tables are available in _Customer Log Analytic workspace_.

| Table Name  | Description  |
| --- | --- |
| PostgresLogs_CL  | Logs of the Customer clusters databases (all postgres related logs) `logger = postgres`  |
| PostgresAuditLogs_CL  | Audit Logs of the Customer clusters databases `logger = pgaudit or edb_audit`  |

You can use KQL Query editor to compose your queries.
