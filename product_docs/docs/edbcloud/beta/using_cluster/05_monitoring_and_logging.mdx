## Azure Log Analytics

When EDB Cloud deploys workloads on Azure, the logs from the PostgreSQL clusters are forwarded to the Azure Log Workspace.
To query EDB Cloud logs, you must use [Azure Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview) and [Kusto Query language](https://azure-training.com/azure-data-science/the-kusto-query-language/).



##  Customer Log Analytics Workspace


All logs from your PostgreSQL clusters are stored in the _Customer Log Analytics workspace_. To find your _Customer Log Analytics workspace_, do the following:

1. Log in to the Azure Portal.

2. Select the Resource Groups section.

2. Select the Resource Group corresponding to the region where you choose to deploy your EDB Cloud. You will see resources included in that Resource Group.

3. Select the resource of type _Log Analytics workspace_ with the suffix -customer.

4. Select the Logs in the menu on the left in the General section.

5. Close the dashboard with prebuilt queries. This will bring you to the KQL Editor.

The following two tables are available in the _Customer Log Analytic workspace_.

| Table Name  | Description  |
| --- | --- |
| PostgresLogs_CL  | Logs of the Customer clusters databases (all postgres related logs) `logger = postgres`  |
| PostgresAuditLogs_CL  | Audit Logs of the Customer clusters databases `logger = pgaudit or edb_audit`  |

You can use the KQL Query editor to compose your queries over these tables.
