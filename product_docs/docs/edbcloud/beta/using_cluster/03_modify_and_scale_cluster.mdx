---

1. Sign in to the [EDB Cloud](https://portal.edbcloud.com) portal.

1. From the [**Clusters**](https://portal.edbcloud.com/clusters) page, select the name of the cluster you want to edit.

2. Select **Edit Cluster** from the top right corner of the **Cluster Info** panel.
3. Change the cluster’s configurations to the desired values. The following fields are available to edit:

| Configuration | Notes |
| ------------- | ----- |
| Cluster Name  | The name for your cluster. |
| Cluster Password | The password for your cluster. |
| High Availability | High Availability is optional. When high availability is enabled, clusters are configured with one primary and two replicas with synchronous streaming replication. Clusters are configured across availability zones in regions with availability zones. When high availability is disabled, one instance is provisioned. |
| Instance Type* | Select the instance based on the number of vCPUs and amount of memory desired. |
| Volume Properties* | Select volume properties based on the amount of storage and provisioned IOPS desired. Storage can only be scaled up; it cannot be reduced. |
| Number of Connections | Type or use the arrows to enter the desired amount of connections between your cluster and other applications. The default number of connections is 100. |
| Networking | Click the toggle under Networking to enable public networking, which means that any client can connect to your cluster’s public IP address over the internet. By default, your networking is set to private, which allows only IP addresses within your private network to connect to your cluster. |

*Changing the instance type or volume properties could incur higher cloud infrastructure charges.

5. Select **Save** to save your changes.

6. Select **Confirm Changes**. 
!!! Note
    Saving changes may require a database restart.
