title: "Connecting to Your Cluster"
---
You can connect to your cluster using [`psql`](http://postgresguide.com/utilities/psql.html), the terminal-based client for Postgres, or another client.

To connect to your cluster using `psql`:  
1. Go to the [**Clusters**](https://portal.edbcloud.com/clusters) page.
2. Select the name of your cluster. 
3. On the **Overview** tab, select the copy icon to the right of the **Quick Connect** field to copy the command for connecting to your cluster using `psql` to your clipboard. `psql` will prompt for the `edb_admin` user password you selected at cluster creation time.
4. Paste the command in your `psql` terminal. 

To connect to your cluster using a client other than `psql`:
1. Go to the **Clusters** page.
2. Select the name of your cluster. 
3. Select the **Connect** tab. You can review and copy all the relevant information you need from this screen except for the `edb_admin` user password. Please consult the client driver documentation for the connection string format the driver uses.
