title: "Connecting to Your Cluster"

To access connection details for your cluster, click on the name of your cluster on the Clusters page. From there, you will find Quick Connect information for connecting to your cluster using psql, the terminal-based client for Postgres. 

If using a client other than psql, click on the Connect tab next to Overview on the Clusters page. From there, you will find all the relevant information needed to 
connect your client to the database cluster except for the user password: Database Name, Host, Port, Username, and Service URI. 

Please consult the application driver documentation for the connection string format the driver uses.
