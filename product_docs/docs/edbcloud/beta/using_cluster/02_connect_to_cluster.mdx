title: "Connecting to your cluster"
---

You can connect to your cluster using [`psql`](http://postgresguide.com/utilities/psql.html), the terminal-based client for Postgres, or another client. See [Recommended settings for SSL mode](#recommended-settings-for-ssl-mode) for EDB's recommendations for secure connections.

## Using `psql`
To connect to your cluster using `psql`:
1. Sign in to the [EDB Cloud](https://portal.edbcloud.com) portal.

1. Go to the [**Clusters**](https://portal.edbcloud.com/clusters) page.

3. Select the name of your cluster.
4. On the **Overview** tab, select the copy icon to the right of the **Quick Connect** field to copy the command for connecting to your cluster using `psql` to your clipboard. `psql` will prompt for the edb_admin user password you selected at cluster creation time.
5. Paste the command in your terminal.

## Using another client
To connect to your cluster using a client other than `psql`:
1. Sign in to the [EDB Cloud](https://portal.edbcloud.com) portal.

1. Go to the [**Clusters**](https://portal.edbcloud.com/clusters) page.

2. Select the name of your cluster.
3. Select the **Connect** tab. You can review and copy all the relevant information you need from this screen except for the edb_admin user password. Please consult the client driver documentation for the connection string format the driver uses.

## Recommended settings for SSL mode

Different clients can have different default TLS/SSL modes (sslmode). For example, `psql` defaults to `prefer`, which means the client will attempt to establish a TLS connection but fall back to non-TLS if the server does not support it. In the `psql` example provided by EDB in the **Quick Connect** field, `sslmode` is explicitly set to `require`, which means the client will attempt a TLS connection and fail if the connection to the server can't be encrypted.

For public connections and in most environments, EDB recommends setting `sslmode` to `verify-full`. This ensures that you connect to the server you specified and that the connection is encrypted. EDB Cloud generates certificates with LetsEncrypt, a widely trusted certificate authority. Your client machine may already have a bundled CA certificate for LetsEncrypt, for example, at `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` or `/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem`. If it doesn't, your client machine needs a [CA certificate for Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/). Once the CA certificate is in place on your client machine, configure the `sslrootcert` parameter to its location and set the `sslmode` parameter to `verify-full` to verify the certificate to fully validate the connection:

```
psql -W "postgres://edb_admin@xxxxxxxxx.xxxxx.edbcloud.io:5432/edb_admin?sslmode=verify-full&sslrootcert=/usr/share/ca-certificates/isrgrootx1.pem"
```

Once connected to the cluster using `psql`, the `conninfo` meta-command shows the encryption protocol being used for communication. In the case of EDB Cloud,  TLS (v1.2+) is supported:

```
edb_admin=> \conninfo
You are connected to database "edb_admin" as user "edb_admin" on host "xxxxxxxxx.xxxxx.edbcloud.io" at port "5432".
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
```
