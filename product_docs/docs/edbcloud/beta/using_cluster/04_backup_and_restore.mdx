### Backups

- EDB automatically takes full backups for you, along with all changes that occur in the database after the full backup.

- PostgreSQL base backups and WAL (Write-Ahead Log) files are stored in Azure Blob Storage.

- Customers are responsible for the charges associated with backup storage, please reference the Azure Blob Storage page for more information.

### Restore

- In the event of an actual disaster, the PostgreSQL cluster will be restored to the latest point in time.

- Restore times are dependent on the amount of database changes since the last full backup was taken as the contents of the WAL must be replayed.

- Point in time recovery is available, allowing customers to restore the cluster to any supplied timestamp after the oldest full backup.

- Customers can restore backups into a new cluster in the same region or a new region.

### Performing a Cluster Restore

1. Navigate to the cluster you wish to restore on the Home / Clusters page in the EDB Cloud portal. 

2. From the Quick Actions pull-down menu, click Restore

3. The next page is similar to the Create Cluster page, with the option to provide a new Cluster Name and define a *Point in Time* to restore the cluster to. Click *Now* on the calendar button to restore to the last possible recovery point or choose a timestamp to restore further back in time. 

4. Customize and review the Cluster Summary and click Restore Cluster to begin the restore process.  

5. The new cluster will then be available on the Home / Clusters page
