### Backups

EDB automatically takes full backups for you, along with all changes that occur in the database after the full backup.

PostgreSQL base backups and WAL (Write-Ahead Log) files are stored in Azure Blob Storage.

You are responsible for the charges associated with backup storage, see [Azure Blob Storage documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/) for more information.

### Restore

In the event of an actual disaster, the PostgreSQL cluster is restored to the latest point in time.

Restore times are dependent on the amount of database changes since the last full backup was taken as the contents of the WAL must be replayed.

Point in time recovery is available, allowing you to restore the cluster to any supplied timestamp after the oldest full backup.

You can restore backups into a new cluster in the same region or a new region.

### Performing a Cluster Restore

1. Select the cluster you wish to restore on the [**Clusters**](https://portal.edbcloud.com/clusters) page in the EDB Cloud portal. 

2. From **Quick Actions**, select **Restore**.

2. On the **Restore Cluster** page: 

    1. Fill in the required fields.

    3. In the **Source** > **Point in Time Restore** field, select **Now** on the calendar to restore to the last possible recovery point or choose a timestamp to restore further back in time. 

    4. Review your selections in the **Cluster Summary** and select **Restore Cluster** to begin the restore process.  

5. The new cluster is now available on the [**Clusters**](https://portal.edbcloud.com/clusters).
