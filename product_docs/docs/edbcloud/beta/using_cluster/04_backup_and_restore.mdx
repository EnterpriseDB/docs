### Backups

- EDB automatically takes full backups for you, along with all changes that occur in the database after the full backup.

- PostgreSQL base backups and WAL (Write-Ahead Log) files are stored in Azure Blob Storage.

- Customers are responsible for the charges associated with backup storage, please reference the Azure Blob Storage page for more information.

- Customers can specify a retention period for backups.

### Restore

- In the event of an actual disaster, the PostgreSQL cluster will be restored to the latest point in time.
- Restore times are dependent on the amount of database changes since the last full backup was taken as the contents of the WAL must be replayed.

- Point in time recovery is available, allowing customers to restore the cluster to any supplied timestamp after the oldest full backup.

- Customers can restore backups into a new cluster in the same region or a new region.
