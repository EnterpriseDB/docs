title: "Managing Portal Access"
---

EDB Cloud uses Azure Active Directory (AD) to authenticate users and role based access controls to grant users access to different parts of the application.

## Organizations

Each subscribed customer has a unique *organization*. Each organizationâ€™s database clusters are deployed and managed in the customer's cloud account. This ensures complete segregation of customer data between organizations.

Each EDB Cloud organization is associated with an Azure AD tenant. Azure AD establishes the identity of users that belong to an organization. After Azure AD is linked during subscription, users that belong to that AD can login with minimum access privileges.

EDB Cloud supports role based access control policies. A user with the owner role may assign roles to other users in the same organization.

## Roles
Access to EDB Cloud is controlled by roles. Roles are sets of permissions. You use roles to manage permissions assigned to users.

* Each organization will have three default roles available:
  * owner
  * reader
  * contributor
* These roles can be edited by changing their name or description.

### Permissions

Permissions are generally represented in the format *action*:*object* where *action* represents an operation that can be performed and *object* represents a category of portal functionality.

The available *actions* are: create, read, update, delete

The available *objects* are: backups, billing, databases, events, permissions, roles, tickets, users,  versions

### Permissions by Role

The following are the default permission by role:

| Role        | Action |backups | billing | databases | events | roles | permissions | tickets | users | versions |
|-------------|--------|--------|---------|-----------|--------|-------|-------------|---------|-------|----------|
| owner       | create |   x    |         |     x     |        |    x  |       x     |     x   |   x   |    x     |
|             | read   |   x    |    x    |     x     |   x    |    x  |       x     |     x   |   x   |    x     |

|             | delete |   x    |         |     x     |        |       |             |     x   |       |          |
| reader      | create |        |         |           |        |       |             |         |       |          |
|             | read   |   x    |    x    |     x     |   x    |    x  |       x     |     x   |   x   |    x     |
|             | update |        |         |           |        |       |             |         |       |          |
|             | delete |        |         |           |        |       |             |         |       |          |

## Users

When you configured your Azure subscription, you also enabled EDB Cloud to authenticate users from your organization using Azure AD. Before users become visible in the EDB Cloud **Users** screen they need to sign in using Azure AD after receiving special emails sent by your organization. New users signed in to EDB Cloud have a minimum set of permissions until you assign them a role.

### Assigning Roles to Users
To assign appropriate roles to users:
1. Navigate to **Admin > Users**.

2. Select the edit icon for the user.
3. Select **Assign Roles**.
4. Select or deselect roles for the user.
5. Select **Submit**.

!!! Note
    For a user's role assignment to take effect, the user needs to log out from EDB Cloud and log in again.

### Viewing Users

To view all users from your organization that have logged in at least once:

1. Navigate to **Admin > Users**.

2. View the list of users sorted by most recent log in.

## Example Scenario

1. The EDB Cloud organization is created, and Tom logs in and is granted the owner role.

1. Tom asks Jerry to log in, using his Azure AD account; Jerry's account in EDB Cloud is created.
1. Tom grants Sally the contributor role. Sally logs out and back in, and she can now create EDB Cloud clusters.
1. Sally asks Jerry to log in, and grants him the reader role.
1. Jerry logs out and back in, and he can now see the clusters that Sally has created.
