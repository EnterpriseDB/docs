!!! Note
    Access to the Admin screen is required to manage users and permissions.

### Roles
Access to EDB Cloud is controlled by permissions. Roles are sets of permissions. You use roles to manage permissions assigned to users.
#### Default Roles
* The predefined _owner_ role created during marketplace sign up has all permissions.
* Each organization will have two additional default roles of _reader_ and _contributor_ available during Preview.
* These roles can be edited by changing their name, description, or permissions.

#### Role Permissions

Permissions are generally represented in the format _action:object_ where _action_ represents an operation that can be performed and _object_ represents a category of EDB Cloud functionality.

The available _actions_ are:
* _create _
* _read  _
* _update _
* _delete_

The available _objects_ are:
* _databases_
* _backups_
* _events_
* _permissions_
* _roles_
* _users_
* _billing_
* _versions_

### Users

New users gain access to the EDB Cloud through an invitation from an owner. The owner shares a link to the EDB Cloud Portal and users login with their Microsoft Azure Active Directory account. New users will not be assigned any roles by default. After they log in the first time, an owner will see them in the User list and they will be able to assign them a role with permission to access the EDB Cloud.

On the Users page you can view users and assign roles to users.
