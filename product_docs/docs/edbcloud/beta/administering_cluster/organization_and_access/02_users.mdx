### Roles

#### Default Roles
Access to EDB Cloud is based on permissions. Roles are sets of permissions. Roles are used to manage permissions assigned to users.

* The predefined _owner_ role created during marketplace sign up has all permissions.
* Each organization will have two additional default roles of _reader_ and _contributor_ available during Preview.
* These roles can be edited by changing their name, description, or permissions

#### Role Permissions

Permissions are generally represented in the format _action:object_ where _action_ represents an operation that can be performed and _object_ represents a category of EDB Cloud functionality.

The available _actions_ are:
* _create _
* _read  _
* _update _
* _delete_

The available _objects_ are:
* _databases_
* _backups_
* _events_
* _permissions_
* _roles_
* _users_
* _billing_
* _versions_
