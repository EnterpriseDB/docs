Access to EDB Cloud UI  is based on permissions. Roles are sets of permissions. Role is a convenient abstraction to manage permissions assigned to users.

* EDB Cloud preview uses  3 template roles _reader_, _contributor_ and _owner_
* These roles can be edited, including changing their name and changing set of associated permissions

!!! Note
    The release version of EDB Cloud will allow adding new Roles and Delete new Roles.


### Structure of Permissions

In general a permission is a string made of prefix and suffix separated by column. Most permissions have format _action:object,  _The available _actions_ are:



* _create _
* _read  _
* _update _
* _delete_

The prefix _object_  defines a part of  EDB Cloud functionality. The available _objects_ are as follows:



* _databases_
* _backups_
* _events_
* _permissions_
* _roles_
* _users_
* _tickets_
* _billing_
* _versions_

There are two special permissions for superset, where suffix defines superset role. There are only two such permission:

* _superset:alpha_
* _superset:admin_

### Roles Edit Screen

There are three tabs: **Settings, Permissions, **and** Users**

1. **Settings** tab allows to change **Name** and **Description** of the **Role **
2. **Permissions** tab allows to edit a set of permissions assigned to the role
3. **Users** tab list users associated with the **Role**
