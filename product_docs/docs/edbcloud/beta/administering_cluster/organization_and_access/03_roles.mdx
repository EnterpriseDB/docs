title: "Roles"
---

Access to EDB Cloud UI  is based on permissions. Roles are sets of permissions. Role is a convenient abstraction to manage permissions assigned to users.

* The predefined _owner_ role created during marketplace sign up has all permissions.
* EDB Cloud preview uses  3 template roles _reader_, _contributor_ and _owner_
* These roles can be edited, including changing their name and changing set of associated permissions

!!! Note
    The general release version of EDB Cloud will allow adding new roles and deleting roles.


## Structure of Permissions

In general a permission is a string made of prefix and suffix separated by colon.
Most permissions have format _action:object_. The available _actions_ are:


* _create _
* _read  _
* _update _
* _delete_

The prefix _object_  defines a part of  EDB Cloud functionality. The available _objects_ are as follows:



* _databases_
* _backups_
* _events_
* _permissions_
* _roles_
* _users_
* _billing_
* _versions_

There are two special permissions for superset, where suffix defines superset role:

* _superset:alpha_
* _superset:admin_

!!! Note
    Superset and Superset related permissions may not be available in the preview release.
