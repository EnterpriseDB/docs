title: "Organizations"

* For each customer subscribed to EDB Cloud there is a unique **Organization**. Thus an **Organization** is synonymous with a customer.
* **Organizations** subscribed to EDB Cloud are completely isolated from each other. Each **Organizationâ€™s**  database clusters are installed and managed in their own cloud environment. Complete segregation of customer's data is ensured.
* The identity of the **Organization** is established through Azure Active Directory (AD).
* During subscription to EDB Cloud, the Azure AD owned by the **Organization** is linked to EDB Cloud and users which belong to that AD can login to EDB Cloud with minimum access privileges.
* EDB Cloud supports Role Based Access Control policies. A user with **owner** Role may define their own sets of Roles which will be applied across the **Organization**.
* A user with **owner** Role may assign Roles to other users from the same **Organization** to grant them access to different parts of EDB Cloud.
