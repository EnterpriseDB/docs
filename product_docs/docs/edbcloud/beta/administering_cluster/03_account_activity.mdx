The activity log collects EDB Cloud events based on user activity within the portal. It can be used to audit activities performed by users from your organizations or research activities that may have affected your account.

## Events

Events describe actions performed by users. The available actions are:
* create
* read
* update
* delete

Events are related to the following resource types:
* database
* user
* user roles
* role permissions
* organization

!!! Note
    Database events are **not** logging activity on the Postgres server. They are logging the use of the portal to create or modify database clusters.
