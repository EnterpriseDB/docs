title: "Managing User Access"
---

EDB Cloud uses Azure Active Directory to authenticate users and uses EDB Cloud Role Based Access Control to grant users access to different parts of the application.

## Organizations

Each subscribed customer has a unique *organization*. Each organizationâ€™s database clusters are installed and managed in their own cloud account ensuring complete segregation of customer data.

Each EDB Cloud organization belongs to an Azure Active Directory (AD) tenant. Azure AD establishes the identity of users that belong to an organization. After you link your Azure AD during subscription, users that belong to that AD can login with minimum access privileges.

EDB Cloud supports role based access control policies. A user with the **owner** role may assign roles to other users in the same organization. A user with the **owner** role may also define their own sets of roles which can be applied across the organization. 


## Roles
Access to EDB Cloud is controlled by roles. Roles are sets of permissions. You use roles to manage permissions assigned to users.

### Default Roles

* The predefined _owner_ role created during marketplace sign up has all permissions.
* Each organization will have two additional default roles of _reader_ and _contributor_ available during Preview.
* These roles can be edited by changing their name, description, or permissions.

### Role Permissions

Permissions are generally represented in the format _action:object_ where _action_ represents an operation that can be performed and _object_ represents a category of EDB Cloud functionality.

The available _actions_ are:
* _create _
* _read  _
* _update _
* _delete_

The available _objects_ are:
* _databases_
* _backups_
* _events_
* _permissions_
* _roles_
* _users_
* _billing_
* _versions_


### Editing Roles

1. Navigate to Admin > Roles.
2. Select the edit icon for the role in the list.

#### Changing Role Name

To change the name or dscription of the role:
1. Select the **Settings** tab.
2. Edit **Name** or **Description**.
3. Press **Save**.

#### Changing Role Permissions

To change permissions associated with the role:
1. Select **Permissions** tab.
2. Select the **Change Permissions** button on the top right.
3. Select the list of permissions you want to be associated with the role.
4. Press **Submit**

## Users

New users gain access to the EDB Cloud through an invitation from an owner. The owner shares a link to the EDB Cloud Portal and users login with their Microsoft Azure Active Directory account. New users will not be assigned any roles by default. After they log in the first time, an owner will see them in the User list and they will be able to assign them a role with permission to access the EDB Cloud.

On the Users page you can view users and assign roles to users.


### Assigning Roles to Users
To assign appropriate roles to users:
1. Navigate to Admin > Users.
2. Select the edit icon for the user.
3. Select **Assign Roles**.
4. Select or deselect roles for the user.
5. Select **Submit**.

!!! Note
    For a user's role assignment to take effect, the user needs to log out from EDB Cloud and log in again.

### Viewing Users

To view all users from your organization that have logged in at least once:

1. Navigate to Admin > Users.
2. View the list of users sorted by most recent log in.

## Example Scenario
1. AcmeBank owns a subcription to Azure and the acmebank.com Azure AD.
1. AcmeBank purchases a subscription to the EDB Cloud and assigns the name acmebank-com for their organization.
1. Tom and Jerry, who are members of acmebank.com Azure AD, can sign in.
1. Users Tom and Jerry have different roles with different permissions.
1. Jerry, a user with the **owner** role, can create and own PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server clusters.
2. Tom, a user with the **reader** role, can read data from PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server databases.
3. The clusters are deployed in the Azure cloud environment owned by AcmeBank, but managed by EDB.

The following diagram illustrates a mapping between objects that exist within the EDB Cloud and Azure cloud for AcmeBank example scenario.
