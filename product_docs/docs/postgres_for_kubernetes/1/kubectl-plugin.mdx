EDB Postgres for Kubernetes provides a plugin for `kubectl` to manage a cluster in Kubernetes.
The plugin also works with `oc` in an OpenShift environment.

## Install

You can install the `cnp` plugin using a variety of methods.

!!! Note
    For air-gapped systems, installation via package managers, using previously
    downloaded files, may be a good option.

### Via the installation script

```sh
curl -sSfL \
  https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/kubectl-cnp/raw/main/install.sh | \
  sudo sh -s -- -b /usr/local/bin
```

### Using the Debian or RedHat packages

In the
[releases section of the GitHub repository](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/kubectl-cnp/releases),
you can navigate to any release of interest (pick the same or newer release
than your EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator), and in it you will find an **Assets**
section. In that section are pre-built packages for a variety of systems.
As a result, you can follow standard practices and instructions to install
them in your systems.

#### Debian packages

For example, let's install the 1.18.1 release of the plugin, for an Intel based
64 bit server. First, we download the right `.deb` file.

```sh
$ wget https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/kubectl-cnp/releases/download/v1.18.1/kubectl-cnp_1.18.1_linux_x86_64.deb
```

Then, install from the local file using `dpkg`:

```sh
$ dpkg -i kubectl-cnp_1.18.1_linux_x86_64.deb
(Reading database ... 16102 files and directories currently installed.)
Preparing to unpack kubectl-cnp_1.18.1_linux_x86_64.deb ...
Unpacking cnp (1.18.1) over (1.18.1) ...
Setting up cnp (1.18.1) ...
```

#### RPM packages

As in the example for `.deb` packages, let's install the 1.18.1 release for an
Intel 64 bit machine. Note the `--output` flag to provide a file name.

```sh
curl -L https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/kubectl-cnp/releases/download/v1.18.1/kubectl-cnp_1.18.1_linux_x86_64.rpm --output cnp-plugin.rpm
```

Then install with `yum`, and you're ready to use:

```sh
$ yum --disablerepo=* localinstall cnp-plugin.rpm
yum --disablerepo=* localinstall cnp-plugin.rpm
Failed to set locale, defaulting to C.UTF-8
Dependencies resolved.

### Supported Architectures

EDB Postgres for Kubernetes Plugin is currently built for the following
operating system and architectures:

-   Linux
    -   amd64
    -   arm 5/6/7
    -   arm64
    -   s390x
    -   ppc64le
-   macOS
    -   amd64

-   Windows
    -   386
    -   amd64
    -   arm 5/6/7
    -   arm64

## Use

Once the plugin was installed and deployed, you can start using it like this:

```shell
kubectl cnp <command> <args...>
```

### Generation of installation manifests

The `cnp` plugin can be used to generate the YAML manifest for the
installation of the operator. This option would typically be used if you want
to override some default configurations such as number of replicas,
installation namespace, namespaces to watch, and so on.

For details and available options, run:

```shell
kubectl cnp install generate --help
```

The main options are:

-   `-n`: the namespace in which to install the operator (by default: `postgresql-operator-system`)
-   `--replicas`: number of replicas in the deployment
-   `--version`: minor version of the operator to be installed, such as `1.17`.
    If a minor version is specified, the plugin will install the latest patch
    version of that minor version. If no version is supplied the plugin will
    install the latest `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` version of the operator.
-   `--watch-namespace`: comma separated string containing the namespaces to
    watch (by default all namespaces)

An example of the `generate` command, which will generate a YAML manifest that
will install the operator, is as follows:

```shell
kubectl cnp install generate \
  -n king \
  --version 1.17 \
  --replicas 3 \
  --watch-namespace "albert, bb, freddie" \
  > operator.yaml
```

The flags in the above command have the following meaning:

-   `-n king` install the CNP operator into the `king` namespace
-   `--version 1.17` install the latest patch version for minor version 1.17
-   `--replicas 3` install the operator with 3 replicas
-   `--watch-namespaces "albert, bb, freddie"` have the operator watch for
    changes in the `albert`, `bb` and `freddie` namespaces only

### Status

The `status` command provides an overview of the current status of your
cluster, including:

-   **general information**: name of the cluster, PostgreSQL's system ID, number of
    instances, current timeline and position in the WAL
-   **backup**: point of recoverability, and WAL archiving status as returned by
    the `pg_stat_archiver` view from the primary - or designated primary in the
    case of a replica cluster
-   **streaming replication**: information taken directly from the `pg_stat_replication`
    view on the primary instance
-   **instances**: information about each Postgres instance, taken directly by each
    instance manager; in the case of a standby, the `Current LSN` field corresponds
    to the latest write-ahead log location that has been replayed during recovery
    (replay LSN).

!!! Important
    The status information above is taken at different times and at different
    locations, resulting in slightly inconsistent returned values. For example,
    the `Current Write LSN` location in the main header, might be different
    from the `Current LSN` field in the instances status as it is taken at
    two different time intervals.

kubectl cnp status sandbox

```

The command also supports output in `yaml` and `json` format.

### Promote

The meaning of this command is to `promote` a pod in the cluster to primary, so you
can start with maintenance work or test a switch-over situation in your cluster

```shell
kubectl cnp promote cluster-example cluster-example-2
```

Or you can use the instance node number to promote

```shell
kubectl cnp promote cluster-example 2
```

### Certificates

Clusters created using the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator work with a CA to sign
a TLS authentication certificate.

To get a certificate, you need to provide a name for the secret to store
the credentials, the cluster name, and a user for this certificate

```shell
kubectl cnp certificate cluster-cert --cnp-cluster cluster-example --cnp-user appuser
```

After the secret is created, you can get it using `kubectl`

```shell
kubectl get secret cluster-cert
```

And the content of the same in plain text using the following commands:

```shell
kubectl get secret cluster-cert -o json | jq -r '.data | map(@base64d) | .[]'
```

### Restart

The `kubectl cnp restart` command can be used in two cases:

-   requesting the operator to orchestrate a rollout restart
    for a certain cluster. This is useful to apply
    configuration changes to cluster dependent objects, such as ConfigMaps
    containing custom monitoring queries.

-   request a single instance restart, either in-place if the instance is
    the cluster's primary or deleting and recreating the pod if
    it is a replica.

```shell
# this command will restart a whole cluster in a rollout fashion
kubectl cnp restart [clusterName]

# this command will restart a single instance, according to the policy above
kubectl cnp restart [clusterName] [pod]
```

If the in-place restart is requested but the change cannot be applied without
a switchover, the switchover will take precedence over the in-place restart. A
common case for this will be a minor upgrade of PostgreSQL image.

!!! Note
    If you want ConfigMaps and Secrets to be **automatically** reloaded
    by instances, you can add a label with key `k8s.enterprisedb.io/reload` to it.

### Reload

The `kubectl cnp reload` command requests the operator to trigger a reconciliation
loop for a certain cluster. This is useful to apply configuration changes
to cluster dependent objects, such as ConfigMaps containing custom monitoring queries.

The following command will reload all configurations for a given cluster:

```shell
kubectl cnp reload [cluster_name]
```

### Maintenance

The `kubectl cnp maintenance` command helps to modify one or more clusters
across namespaces and set the maintenance window values, it will change
the following fields:

-   .spec.nodeMaintenanceWindow.inProgress
-   .spec.nodeMaintenanceWindow.reusePVC

Accepts as argument `set` and `unset` using this to set the
`inProgress` to `true` in case `set`and to `false` in case of `unset`.

By default, `reusePVC` is always set to `false` unless the `--reusePVC` flag is passed.

The plugin will ask for a confirmation with a list of the cluster to modify
and their new values, if this is accepted this action will be applied to
all the cluster in the list.

If you want to set in maintenance all the PostgreSQL in your Kubernetes cluster,
just need to write the following command:

```shell
kubectl cnp maintenance set --all-namespaces
```

And you'll have the list of all the cluster to update

```shell
The following are the new values for the clusters
Namespace  Cluster Name     Maintenance  reusePVC
---------  ------------     -----------  --------
default    cluster-example  true         false
default    pg-backup        true         false
test       cluster-example  true         false
Do you want to proceed? [y/n]: y
```

### Report

The `kubectl cnp report` command bundles various pieces
of information into a ZIP file.
It aims to provide the needed context to debug problems
with clusters in production.

It has two sub-commands: `operator` and `cluster`.

#### report Operator

The `operator` sub-command requests the operator to provide information
regarding the operator deployment, configuration and events.

!!! Important
    All confidential information in Secrets and ConfigMaps is REDACTED.
    The Data map will show the **keys** but the values will be empty.
    The flag `-S` / `--stopRedaction` will defeat the redaction and show the
    values. Use only at your own risk, this will share private data.

!!! Note
    By default, operator logs are not collected, but you can enable operator
    log collection with the `--logs` flag

-   **deployment information**: the operator Deployment and operator Pod
-   **configuration**: the Secrets and ConfigMaps in the operator namespace
-   **events**: the Events in the operator namespace
-   **webhook configuration**: the mutating and validating webhook configurations
-   **webhook service**: the webhook service
-   **logs**: logs for the operator Pod (optional, off by default) in JSON-lines format

The command will generate a ZIP file containing various manifest in YAML format
(by default, but settable to JSON with the `-o` flag).
Use the `-f` flag to name a result file explicitly. If the `-f` flag is not used, a
default time-stamped filename is created for the zip file.

!!! Note
    The report plugin obeys `kubectl` conventions, and will look for objects constrained
    by namespace. The CNP Operator will generally not be installed in the same
    namespace as the clusters.
    E.g. the default installation namespace is postgresql-operator-system

```shell
kubectl cnp report operator -n <namespace>
```

results in

```shell
Successfully written report to "report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>.zip" (format: "yaml")
```

With the `-f` flag set:

```shell
kubectl cnp report operator -n <namespace> -f reportRedacted.zip
```

Unzipping the file will produce a time-stamped top-level folder to keep the
directory tidy:

```shell
unzip reportRedacted.zip
```

will result in:

```shell
Archive:  reportRedacted.zip
   creating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/
   creating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/
  inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/deployment.yaml
  inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/operator-pod.yaml
  inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/events.yaml
  inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/validating-webhook-configuration.yaml
  inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/mutating-webhook-configuration.yaml
  inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/webhook-service.yaml
  inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/postgresql-operator-ca-secret.yaml
  inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/postgresql-operator-webhook-cert.yaml
```

If you activated the `--logs` option, you'd see an extra subdirectory:

```shell
Archive:  report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>.zip
  <snipped …>
  creating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/operator-logs/
  inflating: report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/operator-logs/postgresql-operator-controller-manager-66fb98dbc5-pxkmh-logs.jsonl
```

!!! Note
    The plugin will try to get the PREVIOUS operator's logs, which is helpful
    when investigating restarted operators.
    In all cases, it will also try to get the CURRENT operator logs. If current
    and previous logs are available, it will show them both.

```json
====== Begin of Previous Log =====
2023-03-28T12:56:41.251711811Z {"level":"info","ts":"2023-03-28T12:56:41Z","logger":"setup","msg":"Starting EDB Postgres for Kubernetes Operator","version":"1.19.1","build":{"Version":"1.19.0+dev107","Commit":"cc9bab17","Date":"2023-03-28"}}
2023-03-28T12:56:41.251851909Z {"level":"info","ts":"2023-03-28T12:56:41Z","logger":"setup","msg":"Starting pprof HTTP server","addr":"0.0.0.0:6060"}

====== End of Previous Log =====
2023-03-28T12:57:09.854306024Z {"level":"info","ts":"2023-03-28T12:57:09Z","logger":"setup","msg":"Starting EDB Postgres for Kubernetes Operator","version":"1.19.1","build":{"Version":"1.19.0+dev107","Commit":"cc9bab17","Date":"2023-03-28"}}

```

If the operator hasn't been restarted, you'll still see the `====== Begin …`
and  `====== End …` guards, with no content inside.

You can verify that the confidential information is REDACTED by default:

```shell
cd report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/
head postgresql-operator-ca-secret.yaml
```

```yaml
data:
  ca.crt: ""
  ca.key: ""
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2022-03-22T10:42:28Z"
  managedFields:
  - apiVersion: v1
    fieldsType: FieldsV1
    fieldsV1:
```

With the `-S` (`--stopRedaction`) option activated, secrets are shown:

```shell
kubectl cnp report operator -n <namespace> -f reportNonRedacted.zip -S
```

You'll get a reminder that you're about to view confidential information:

```shell
WARNING: secret Redaction is OFF. Use it with caution
Successfully written report to "reportNonRedacted.zip" (format: "yaml")
```

```shell
unzip reportNonRedacted.zip
head postgresql-operator-ca-secret.yaml
```

```yaml
data:
  ca.crt: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBD…
  ca.key: LS0tLS1CRUdJTiBF…
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2022-03-22T10:42:28Z"
  managedFields:
  - apiVersion: v1
    fieldsType: FieldsV1
```

#### report Cluster

The `cluster` sub-command gathers the following:

-   **cluster resources**: the cluster information, same as `kubectl get cluster -o yaml`
-   **cluster pods**: pods in the cluster namespace matching the cluster name
-   **cluster jobs**: jobs, if any, in the cluster namespace matching the cluster name
-   **events**: events in the cluster namespace
-   **pod logs**: logs for the cluster Pods (optional, off by default) in JSON-lines format
-   **job logs**: logs for the Pods created by jobs (optional, off by default) in JSON-lines format

The `cluster` sub-command accepts the `-f` and `-o` flags, as the `operator` does.
If the `-f` flag is not used, a default timestamped report name will be used.
Note that the cluster information does not contain configuration Secrets / ConfigMaps,
so the `-S` is disabled.

!!! Note
    By default, cluster logs are not collected, but you can enable cluster
    log collection with the `--logs` flag

Usage:

```shell
kubectl cnp report cluster <clusterName> [flags]
```

Note that, unlike the `operator` sub-command, for the `cluster` sub-command you
need to provide the cluster name, and very likely the namespace, unless the cluster
is in the default one.

```shell
kubectl cnp report cluster example -f report.zip -n example_namespace
```

and then:

```shell
unzip report.zip
```

```shell

   creating: report_cluster_example_<TIMESTAMP>/manifests/

Remember that you can use the `--logs` flag to add the pod and job logs to the ZIP.

```shell
kubectl cnp report cluster example -n example_namespace --logs
```

will result in:

```shell

```

```shell
unzip report_cluster_<TIMESTAMP>.zip
```

##### OpenShift support

The `report operator` directive will detect automatically if the cluster is
running on OpenShift, and will get the Cluster Service Version and the
Install Plan, and add them automatically to the zip under the `openshift`
sub-folder.

!!! Note
    the namespace becomes very important on OpenShift. The default namespace
    for OpenShift in CNP is "openshift-operators". Many (most) clients will use
    a different namespace for the CNP operator.

```sh
kubectl cnp report operator -n openshift-operators
```

results in

```sh
Successfully written report to "report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>.zip" (format: "yaml")
```

You can find the OpenShift-related files in the `openshift` sub-folder:

```shell
unzip report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>.zip
cd report_operator_<TIMESTAMP>/
cd openshift
head clusterserviceversions.yaml
```

```text
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
items:
- apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
  kind: ClusterServiceVersion
  metadata:
    annotations:
      alm-examples: |-
        [
          {
            "apiVersion": "postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1",
```

### Destroy

The `kubectl cnp destroy` command helps remove an instance and all the
associated PVCs from a Kubernetes cluster.

The optional `--keep-pvc` flag, if specified, allows you to keep the PVCs,
while removing all `metadata.ownerReferences` that were set by the instance.
Additionally, the `k8s.enterprisedb.io/pvcStatus` label on the PVCs will change from
`ready` to `detached` to signify that they are no longer in use.

Running again the command without the `--keep-pvc` flag will remove the
detached PVCs.

Usage:

```
kubectl cnp destroy [CLUSTER_NAME] [INSTANCE_ID]
```

The following example removes the `cluster-example-2` pod and the associated
PVCs:

```
kubectl cnp destroy cluster-example 2
```

### Cluster hibernation

Sometimes you may want to suspend the execution of a EDB Postgres for Kubernetes `Cluster`
while retaining its data, then resume its activity at a later time. We've
called this feature **cluster hibernation**.

Hibernation is only available via the `kubectl cnp hibernate [on|off]`
commands.

Hibernating a EDB Postgres for Kubernetes cluster means destroying all the resources
generated by the cluster, except the PVCs that belong to the PostgreSQL primary
instance.

You can hibernate a cluster with:

```
kubectl cnp hibernate on <cluster-name>
```

This will:

1.  shutdown every PostgreSQL instance
2.  detach the PVCs containing the data of the primary instance, and annotate
    them with the latest database status and the latest cluster configuration
3.  delete the `Cluster` resource, including every generated resource - except
    the aforementioned PVCs

When hibernated, a EDB Postgres for Kubernetes cluster is represented by just a group of
PVCs, in which the one containing the `PGDATA` is annotated with the latest
available status, including content from `pg_controldata`.

!!! Warning
    A cluster having fenced instances cannot be hibernated, as fencing is
    part of the hibernation procedure too.

In case of error the operator will not be able to revert the procedure. You can
still force the operation with:

```
kubectl cnp hibernate on cluster-example --force
```

A hibernated cluster can be resumed with:

```
kubectl cnp hibernate off <cluster-name>
```

Once the cluster has been hibernated, it's possible to show the last
configuration and the status that PostgreSQL had after it was shut down.
That can be done with:

```
kubectl cnp hibernate status <cluster-name>
```

### Benchmarking the database with pgbench

Pgbench can be run against an existing PostgreSQL cluster with following
command:

```
kubectl cnp pgbench <cluster-name> -- --time 30 --client 1 --jobs 1
```

Refer to the [Benchmarking pgbench section](benchmarking.md#pgbench) for more
details.

### Benchmarking the storage with fio

fio can be run on an existing storage class with following command:

```
kubectl cnp fio <fio-job-name> -n <namespace>
```

Refer to the [Benchmarking fio section](benchmarking.md#fio) for more details.

### Requesting a new base backup

The `kubectl cnp backup` command requests a new physical base backup for
an existing Postgres cluster by creating a new `Backup` resource.

The following example requests an on-demand backup for a given cluster:

```shell
kubectl cnp backup [cluster_name]
```

The created backup will be named after the request time:

```shell
kubectl cnp backup cluster-example
backup/cluster-example-20230121002300 created
```

By default, new created backup will use the backup target policy defined
in cluster to choose which instance to run on. You can also use `--backup-target`
option to override this policy. please refer to [Backup and Recovery](backup_recovery.md)
for more information about backup target.

### Launching psql

The `kubectl cnp psql` command starts a new PostgreSQL interactive front-end
process (psql) connected to an existing Postgres cluster, as if you were running
it from the actual pod. This means that you will be using the `postgres` user.

!!! Important
    As you will be connecting as `postgres` user, in production environments this
    method should be used with extreme care, by authorized personnel only.

```shell
kubectl cnp psql cluster-example

psql (15.3 (Debian 15.3-1.pgdg110+1))
Type "help" for help.

postgres=#
```

By default, the command will connect to the primary instance. The user can
select to work against a replica by using the `--replica` option:

```shell
kubectl cnp psql --replica cluster-example
psql (15.3 (Debian 15.3-1.pgdg110+1))

Type "help" for help.

postgres=# select pg_is_in_recovery();
 pg_is_in_recovery
-------------------
 t
(1 row)

postgres=# \q
```

This command will start `kubectl exec`, and the `kubectl` executable must be
reachable in your `PATH` variable to correctly work.

### Snapshotting a Postgres cluster

The `kubectl cnp snapshot` creates consistent snapshots of a Postgres
`Cluster` by:

1.  choosing a replica Pod to work on
2.  fencing the replica
3.  taking the snapshot
4.  unfencing the replica

!!! Warning
    A cluster already having a fenced instance cannot be snapshotted.

At the moment, this command can be used only for clusters having at least one
replica: that replica will be shut down by the fencing procedure to ensure the
snapshot to be consistent (cold backup). As the development of
declarative support for Kubernetes' `VolumeSnapshot` API continues,
this limitation will be removed, allowing you to take online backups
as business continuity requires.

!!! Important
    Even if the procedure will shut down a replica, the primary
    Pod will not be involved.

The `kubectl cnp snapshot` command requires the cluster name:

```shell
kubectl cnp snapshot cluster-example

waiting for cluster-example-3 to be fenced
waiting for VolumeSnapshot cluster-example-3-1682539624 to be ready to use
unfencing pod cluster-example-3
```

The `VolumeSnapshot` resource will be created with an empty
`VolumeSnapshotClass` reference. That resource is intended by be used by the
`VolumeSnapshotClass` configured as default.

A specific `VolumeSnapshotClass` can be requested via the `-c` option:

```shell
kubectl cnp snapshot cluster-example -c longhorn
```
