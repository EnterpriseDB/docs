| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature | Support for Snappy compression. Snappy is a fast compression option for backups that increase the speed of uploads to the object store using a lower compression ratio.  |
| Feature | Support for tagging files uploaded to the Barman object store. This feature requires Barman 2.18 in the operand image. of backups after Cluster deletion. |
| Feature | Extension of the status of a Cluster with status.conditions. The condition ContinuousArchiving indicates that the Cluster has started to archive WAL files. |
| Feature | Improve the status command of the cnp plugin for kubectl with additional information: add a Cluster Summary section showing the status of the Cluster and a Certificates Status section including the status of the certificates used in the Cluster along with the time left to expire. |
| Feature | Support the new barman-cloud-check-wal-archive command to detect a non-empty backup destination when creating a new cluster. |
| Feature | Add support for using a Secret to add default monitoring queries through MONITORING_QUERIES_SECRET configuration variable. |
| Feature | Allow the user to restrict containerâ€™s permissions using AppArmor (on Kubernetes clusters deployed with AppArmor support). |
| Feature | Add Windows platform support to cnp plugin for kubectl, now the plugin is available on Windows x86 and ARM. |
| Feature | Drop support for Kubernetes 1.18 and deprecated API versions |
| Container images | PostgreSQL containers include Barman 2.18. |
| Security fix | Add coherence check of username field inside owner and superuser secrets; previously, a malicious user could have used the secrets to change the password of any PostgreSQL user. |

| Bug fix | Disable PostgreSQL self-restart after a crash. The instance controller handles the lifecycle of the PostgreSQL instance. |
| Bug fix | Prevent modification of spec.postgresUID and spec.postgresGID fields in validation webhook. Changing these fields after Cluster creation makes PostgreSQL unable to start. |

| Bug fix | Correct a bug resulting in a Cluster being marked as Healthy when not initialized yet. |
| Bug fix | Allows standby servers in clusters with a very high WAL production rate to switch to streaming once they are aligned. |
| Bug fix | Fix a race condition during the startup of a PostgreSQL pod that could seldom lead to a crash. |
| Bug fix | Fix a race condition that could lead to a failure initializing the first PVC in a Cluster. |
| Bug fix | Remove an extra restart of a just demoted primary Pod before joining the Cluster as a replica. |
| Bug fix | Correctly handle replication-sensitive PostgreSQL configuration parameters when recovering from a backup. |
| Bug fix | Fix missing validation of PostgreSQL configurations during Cluster creation.  |
