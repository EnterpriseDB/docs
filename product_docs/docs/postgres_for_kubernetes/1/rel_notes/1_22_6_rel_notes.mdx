Released: 26 Aug 2024

This release of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes includes the following:

### Features

* **Configuration of Pod Disruption Budgets (PDB)**: Introduced the `.spec.enablePDB` field to disable PDBs on the primary instance, allowing proper eviction of the pod during maintenance operations. This is particularly useful for single-instance deployments. This feature is intended to replace the node maintenance window feature.

### Enhancements

* **cnp plugin updates**: 
  * Enhance the install generate command by adding a --control-plane option, allowing deployment of the operator on control-plane nodes by setting node affinity and tolerations (\#5271).
  * Enhance the destroy command to delete also any job related to the target instance (\#5298).

### Fixes

* Synchronous replication self-healing checks now exclude terminated pods, focusing only on active and functional pods (\#5210).
* The instance manager will now terminate all existing operator-related replication connections following a role change in a replica cluster (\#5209).
* Allow setting smartShutdownTimeout to zero, enabling immediate fast shutdown and bypassing the smart shutdown process when required (\#5347).
