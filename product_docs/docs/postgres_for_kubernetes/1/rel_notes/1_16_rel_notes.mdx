## Important changes to our upgrade policy
We are adopting a new policy to support the last two minor versions of the product, in line with the CloudNativePG community.

As a result, we are introducing the following head versions in the new OLM channels in OpenShift to manage the update streams for EDB Postgres for Kubernetes:

* `fast`: the latest available patch release for the latest available minor release 
* `stable-v1.16`: the latest available patch release of the 1.16 minor release
* `stable-v1.15`: the latest available patch release of the 1.15 minor release

Prior to this release, the only channel that we were supporting was the `stable` channel. This channel is now obsolete. However, for back compatibility it is currently set as an alias of the `stable-v1.15` channel and it will be removed once version 1.15 goes End of Life.
