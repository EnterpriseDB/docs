| Security fix | Set readOnlyRootFilesystem security context for pods.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Change | IMPORTANT: If you have previously deployed the Cloud Native PostgreSQL operator using the YAML manifest, you must delete the existing operator deployment before installing the new version. This is required to avoid conflicts with other Kubernetes API's due to a change in labels and label selectors being directly managed by the operator. Please refer to the Cloud Native PostgreSQL documentation for additional detail on upgrading to 1.4.0. |
| Change | Fix the labels that are automatically defined by the operator, renaming them from control-plane: controller-manager to app.kubernetes.io/name: cloud-native-postgresql.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Change | Assign the metrics name to the TCP port for the Prometheus exporter. |
| Change | Set cnp_metrics_exporter as the application_name to the metrics exporter connection in PostgreSQL. |
| Change | When available, use the application database for monitoring queries of the Prometheus exporter instead of the postgres database. |
| Documentation fixes | Customization of monitoring queries. |
| Documentation fixes | Operator upgrade instructions. |
| Bug fix | Avoid using -R when calling pg_basebackup. |
| Bug fix | Remove stack trace from error log when getting the status. |
