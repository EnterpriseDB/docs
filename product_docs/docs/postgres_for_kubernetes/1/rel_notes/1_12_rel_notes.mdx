This release of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes includes the following:

| Type           | Description                                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature | Add Kubernetes 1.23 to the list of supported Kubernetes distributions and remove end-to-end tests for 1.17, which ended support by the Kubernetes project in Dec 2020. |
| Feature | Improve the responsiveness of pod status checks in case of network issues by adding a connection timeout of 2 seconds and a communication timeout of 30 seconds. This change sets a limit on the time the operator waits for a pod to report its status before declaring it as failed, enhancing the robustness and predictability of a failover operation. |
| Feature | Introduce the .spec.inheritedMetadata field to the Cluster allowing the user to specify labels and annotations that will apply to all objects generated by the Cluster. |
| Feature | Reduce the number of queries executed when calculating the status of an instance. |
| Feature | Add a readiness probe for PgBouncer. |
| Feature | Add support for custom Certification Authority of the endpoint of Barman’s backup object store when using Azure protocol. |
| Bug fix | During a failover, wait to select a new primary until all the WAL streaming connections are closed. The operator now sets by default wal_sender_timeout and wal_receiver_timeout to 5 seconds to make sure standby nodes will quickly notice if the primary has network issues.  |
| Bug fix | Change WAL archiving strategy in replica clusters to fix rolling updates by setting "archive_mode" to "always" for any PostgreSQL instance in a replica cluster. We then restrict the upload of the WAL only from the current and target designated primary. A WAL may be uploaded twice during switchovers, which is not an issue.   |
| Bug fix | Fix support for custom Certification Authority of the endpoint of Barman’s backup object store in replica clusters source.  |
| Bug fix | Use a fixed name for default monitoring config map in the cluster namespace.  |
| Bug fix | If the defaulting webhook is not working for any reason, the operator now updates the Cluster with the defaults also during the reconciliation cycle.  |
| Bug fix | Fix the comparison of resource requests and limits to fix a rare issue leading to an update of all the pods on every reconciliation cycle. |
| Bug fix | Improve log messages from webhooks to also include the object namespace.  |
| Bug fix | Stop logging a “default” message at the start of every reconciliation loop.  |
| Bug fix | Stop logging a PodMonitor deletion on every reconciliation cycle if enablePodMonitor is false.  |
| Bug fix | Do not complain about possible architecture mismatch if a pod is not reachable. |
