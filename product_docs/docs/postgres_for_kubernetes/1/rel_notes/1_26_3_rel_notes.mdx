This release of EDB CloudNativePG Cluster includes the following:

## Highlights

We've consolidated our [private container registry](../private_edb_registries) into a single location. This change simplifies access and deployment. 
Starting with v1.26.3, any customer attempting an operator upgrade, MUST configure the new unified repository pull secret! 
For details and instructions, follow the [Central Migration Guide](../migrating_edb_registries).
