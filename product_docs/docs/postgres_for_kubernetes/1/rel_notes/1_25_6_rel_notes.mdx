Released: 10 February 2025

This release of EDB CloudNativePG Cluster is built on the final community release of the 1.25.x series of CloudNativePG. 
EDB will continue providing LTS releases in the 1.25.x series according to our [Long-Term Support
policy](/postgres_for_kubernetes/1/#long-term-support). 

This release of EDB CloudNativePG Cluster includes the following:

## Enhancements

<table class="table w-100"><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th width="10%">Addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><details><summary>Added support for Azure's <code>DefaultAzureCredential</code> authentication mechanism
for backup and recovery operations.
</summary><hr/><p>This can be enabled by setting
<code>azureCredentials.useDefaultAzureCredentials: true</code> in the backup
configuration, simplifying authentication in Azure environments without
requiring explicit storage account keys or SAS tokens.</p>

## Bug Fixes

<table class="table w-100"><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th width="10%">Addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><details><summary>Fixed a bug where replicas could enter a crash-loop by attempting to download
timeline history files from future timelines.
</summary><hr/><p>This occurred when stale files
remained in the WAL archive from a previous cluster life, and replicas would
incorrectly try to fetch them during recovery.</p>
</details></td><td><a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/9650">#9650</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Fixed a race condition in `replica_cluster` setups during designated primary
transitions, preventing transient "no primary" states in the replica cluster.       
</td><td><a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/9601">#9601</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Fixed a validation gap in Azure object store configurations where the
<code>storageAccount</code> was not required when using explicit credentials (such as a
storage key or SAS token).
</summary><hr/><p>The operator now enforces that a storage account
name is provided in these cases and that <code>connectionString</code> is mutually
exclusive with other authentication parameters.</p>
</details></td><td><a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/9604">#9604</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Optimized the deletion path so the operator begins cleaning up resources
immediately when a cluster is marked for deletion.
</summary><hr/><p>This significantly reduces the time a cluster remains in <code>Terminating</code> status
while waiting for internal reconciliation loops.</p>
</details></td><td><a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/9555">#9555</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Fixed an issue where replication slots were not properly dropped from
replicas when the feature was disabled or the cluster was reconfigured.
</summary><hr/><p>This ensures that unused slots do not cause WAL build-up on the primary.</p>
</details></td><td><a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/9381">#9381</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Fixed an issue where <code>imagePullSecrets</code> were not added to the <code>ServiceAccount</code>
created for the <code>Pooler</code>.
</summary><hr/><p>Previously, these secrets were applied to the
Deployment but not the SA, which caused image pull failures in restricted
environments using certain security policies.</p>
</details></td><td><a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/9427">#9427</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Added a check to verify ownership before the operator deletes a <code>PodMonitor</code>.
</summary><hr/><p>This prevents the operator from accidentally deleting manually managed
monitoring resources that happen to share a name with expected CNP
resources. Contributed by @juliamertz.</p>
</details></td><td><a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/9340">#9340</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Fixed a bug where <code>pg_stat_archiver</code> metrics would continue to report stale
data on standby instances after a switchover.
</summary><hr/><p>The exporter now skips these metrics on standbys, as PostgreSQL only provides
valid archiver stats on the primary.</p>
</details></td><td><a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/9411">#9411</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Clarified the interpretation of timestamp formats for recovery <code>targetTime</code>.
</summary><hr/><p>Timestamps provided without an explicit timezone are now consistently
interpreted as UTC. Contributed by @pchovelon.</p>
</details></td><td><a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/8937">#8937</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Fixed backup status updates to prevent "resource has been modified" errors
during concurrent updates.
</td><td><a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/9551">#9551</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Fixed event reporting to use the correct pod name when a backup pod is not
found.
</td><td><a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/9552">#9552</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Improved performance of scheduled backup operations for clusters with a very
high number of historical backups.
</td><td><a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/9489">#9489</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Fixed error handling when removing finalizers on `Database` objects.
</td><td><a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/9431">#9431</a></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Updated the <code>status</code> command to display &quot;Disabled&quot; when the
<code>skipWalArchiving</code> annotation is present on a cluster.
</summary><hr/><p>This replaces
confusing &quot;starting up&quot; or &quot;unknown&quot; states when WAL archiving is
intentionally bypassed.</p>
</details></td><td><a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/9709">#9709</a></td></tr>
<tr><td>Fixed the `logs --follow` command to continue polling for new pods instead
of exiting prematurely when all current log streams complete.
</td><td><a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/9599">#9599</a></td></tr>
