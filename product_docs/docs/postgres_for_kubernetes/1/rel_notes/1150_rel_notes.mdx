EDB Postgres for Kubernetes includes the following:

| Type           | Description                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Feature        | Fencing: Introduction of the fencing capability for a cluster or a given set of PostgreSQL instances through the `k8s.enterprisedb.io/fencedInstances` annotation, which, if not empty, disables switchover/failovers in the cluster; fenced instances are shut down and the pod is kept running (while considered not ready) for inspection and emergencies. |
| Feature        | LDAP authentication: Allow LDAP Simple Bind and Search+Bind configuration options in `pg_hba.conf` to be defined in the Postgres cluster spec declaratively, enabling the optional use of Kubernetes secrets for sensitive options such as `ldapbindpasswd`.  |
| Feature        | Introduction of the `primaryUpdateMethod` option, accepting the values of `switchover` (default) and `restart`, to be used in case of unsupervised `primaryUpdateStrategy`; this method controls what happens to the primary instance during the rolling update procedure. |
| Feature        | New `report` command in the `kubectl cnp` plugin for better diagnosis and more effective troubleshooting of both the operator and a specific Postgres cluster. |
| Feature        | Prune those `Backup` objects that are no longer in the backup object store. |
| Feature        | Specification of target timeline and `LSN` in Point-In-Time Recovery bootstrap method. |
| Feature        | Support for the `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` authentication token in AWS S3 through the `sessionToken` option. |
| Feature        | Default image name for PgBouncer in `Pooler` pods set to `quay.io/enterprisedb/pgbouncer:1.17.0`. |
| Bug fix        | Base backup detection for Point-In-Time Recovery via `targetTime` correctly works now, as previously a target prior to the latest available backup was not possible (the detection algorithm was always wrong by selecting the last backup as a starting point).  |
| Bug fix        | Improved resilience of hot standby sensitive parameters by relying on the values the operator collects from `pg_controldata`. |
| Bug fix        | Control of hot standby sensitive parameters correctly works with EPAS instances now. |
| Bug fix        | Intermediate certificates handling has been improved by properly discarding invalid entries, instead of throwing an invalid certificate error. |
| Bug fix        | Prometheus exporter metric collection queries in the databases are now committed instead of rolled back (this might result in a change in the number of rolled back transactions that are visible from downstream dashboards, where applicable). |
