  type: Change
  impact: High
- relnote: Deprecated the `monitoring.enablePodMonitor` field
  details: |
    in the `Cluster` and `Pooler` resources. This field will be removed in a future release. Users who
    rely on `PodMonitor` resources should create them manually instead.

  addresses: <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/8753">#8753</a>  
  type: Change
  impact: High
- relnote: Added support for overriding the PgBouncer `auth_type`, `server_tls_sslmode`, and `client_tls_sslmode` settings
  details: |
    which were previously hardcoded. Default values remain consistent with the former behavior but can now be customized when required.

  type: Enhancement
  impact: High
- relnote: Added a `CHECKPOINT` step before PostgreSQL smart and fast shutdowns

  type: Enhancement
  impact: High
- relnote: Added a warning in the instance manager for deprecated or unsupported OS versions

  type: Enhancement
  impact: High
- relnote: Improved certificate parsing error reporting
  details: |
    Failures now log specific errors instead of a generic message, aiding troubleshooting.
    This is particularly relevant after the CVE-2025-58187 fix in Go 1.25.2 and 1.24.8,
    which may trigger parsing failures for invalid DNS SANs.

- relnote: Added a check to ensure the destination WAL archive path is empty when bootstrapping a cluster using the `pg_basebackup` method
  details: |
    consistent with other bootstrap methods.
  jira:
  addresses: <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/8895">#8895</a>
  type: Enhancement
  impact: High
- relnote: Added validation to prevent backups from running on hibernated clusters
  details: |
    Backups attempted on such clusters now fail with reason `ClusterIsHibernated`,
    following the standard prerequisite check pattern.
  jira:
  addresses: <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/8870">#8870</a>
  type: Enhancement
  impact: High
- relnote: Added support for `pprof` profiling
  details: |
    Instances can now enable the `pprof` tool by adding the `alpha.k8s.enterprisedb.io/enableInstancePprof` annotation
    to the `Cluster` resource for advanced debugging.

  type: Enhancement
  impact: High
  component: CNP plugin

- relnote: Fixed backup restoration failures when using custom WAL segment sizes with parallel WAL recovery.
  details: |
    The operator no longer manages the end-of-WAL file marker during restoration,
    preventing errors when backups span multiple WAL segments.
  jira:
  addresses: <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/8873">#8873</a>
  type: Bug fix
  impact: High
- relnote: |

    could be incorrectly used to optimize replica creation.

  addresses: <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/8475">#8475</a>
  type: Bug fix
  impact: High
- relnote: Fixed `initdb` to wait for the application user secret before bootstrapping a new cluster

  type: Bug fix
  impact: High
- relnote: Fixed the connection retry logic in the `cnpgi` plugin

    The reconciliation loop now detects connection pool changes correctly and uses exponential
    backoff to reduce "closed pool" errors.
  jira:
  addresses: <a href="https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-native-postgres/pull/8554">#8554</a>
  type: Bug fix
  impact: High
- relnote: Fixed volume snapshot usage during replica scaling to work with backup plugins.
  details: |
    Previously, this optimization was only available with the in-tree backup
    implementation, but now clusters using backup plugins can also leverage volume
    snapshots when creating new replicas.
