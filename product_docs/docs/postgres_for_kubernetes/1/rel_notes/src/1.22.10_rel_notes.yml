- relnote: Corrected the `PodMonitor` configuration by adjusting the `matchLabels` scope for the targeted pooler and cluster pods.
  details: |
    Previously, the `matchLabels` were too broad, inadvertently inheriting labels from the cluster and leading to data collection from unintended targets.

  details: |
    This will become an error in future releases. Users should update their configurations to include explicit units (e.g., `512MB` instead of `512`).
