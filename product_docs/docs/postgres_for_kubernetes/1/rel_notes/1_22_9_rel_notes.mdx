Released: 04 Mar 2025

EDB Postgres for Kubernetes version 1.22.9 is an LTS release of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes; there is no corresponding upstream release of CloudNativePG.

!!! Warning
    A new LTS release, version 1.25.1, is now available!
    Please note that support for 1.22 will officially end on July 2025.
    
    We recommend starting your upgrade planning now to transition smoothly to
    the 1.25 LTS release.

This release of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes includes the following:

### Enhancements

- Introduced a startup probe for the operator to enhance reliability and
  prevent premature liveness probe failures during initialization. ([#7008](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/7008))
- Added support for using the `-r` service with the Pooler. ([#6868](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6868))
- Introduced an optional `--ttl` flag for the `pgbench` plugin, enabling
  automatic deletion of completed jobs after a user-defined duration. ([#6701](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6701))
- Updated the default PostgreSQL version to 17.4 for new cluster
  definitions. ([#6960](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6960))

### Security

- The operator image build process has been enhanced to strengthen
  security and transparency. Images are now signed with `cosign`, and
  OCI attestations are generated, incorporating the Software Bill of
  Materials (SBOM) and provenance data. Additionally, OCI annotations
  have been added to improve traceability and ensure the integrity of
  the images.

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed inconsistent behavior in default probe knob values when `.spec.probes`
  is defined, ensuring users can override all settings, including
  `failureThreshold`. If unspecified in the startup probe, `failureThreshold` is
  now correctly derived from `.spec.startupDelay / periodSeconds` (default: `10`,
  now overridable). The same logic applies to liveness probes via
  `.spec.livenessProbeTimeout`. ([#6656](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6656))
- Fixed an issue where WAL metrics were unavailable after an instance restart
  until a configuration change was applied. ([#6816](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6816))
- Fixed an issue in monolithic database import where role import was skipped if
  no roles were specified. ([#6646](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6646))
- Added support for new metrics introduced in PgBouncer 1.24. ([#6630](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6630))
- Improved handling of replication-sensitive parameter reductions by ensuring
  timely reconciliation after primary server restarts. ([#6440](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6440))
- Ensured `override.conf` is consistently included in `postgresql.conf` during
  replica cluster bootstrapping, preventing replication failures due to missing
  configuration settings. ([#6808](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6808))
- Ensured `override.conf` is correctly initialized before invoking `pg_rewind`
  to prevent failures during primary role changes. ([#6670](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6670))
- Enhanced webhook responses to return both warnings and errors when
  applicable, improving diagnostic accuracy. ([#6579](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6579))
- Ensured the operator version is correctly reconciled. ([#6496](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6496))
- Improved PostgreSQL version detection by using a more precise check of the
  data directory. ([#6659](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6659))
- Volume Snapshot Backups:
    - Fixed an issue where unused backup connections were not properly cleaned
      up. ([#6882](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6882))
    - Ensured the instance manager closes stale PostgreSQL connections left by
      failed volume snapshot backups. ([#6879](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6879))
    - Prevented the operator from starting a new volume snapshot backup while
      another is already in progress. ([#6890](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6890))
- `cnp` plugin:
    - Restored functionality of the `promote` plugin command. ([#6476](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6476))
    - Enhanced `kubectl cnp report --logs <cluster>` to collect logs from all
      containers, including sidecars. ([#6636](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6636))
    - Ensured `pgbench` jobs can run when a `Cluster` uses an `ImageCatalog`.
      ([#6868](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6868))

### Technical Enhancements

- Added support for Kubernetes `client-gen`, enabling automated generation of
  Go clients for all EDB Postgres for Kubernetes CRDs. ([#6695](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6695))
