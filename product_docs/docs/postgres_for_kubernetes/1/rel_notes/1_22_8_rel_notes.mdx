This release of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes includes the following:

### Enhancements

- Enable customization of startup, liveness, and readiness probes through the
  `.spec.probes` stanza. ([#6266](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6266))
- Add the `cnpg.io/userType` label to secrets generated for predefined users,
  specifically `superuser` and `app`. ([#4392](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/4392))
- Improved validation for the `spec.schedule` field in ScheduledBackups,
  raising warnings for potential misconfigurations. ([#5396](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/5396))
- `cnpg` plugin:
    - Honor the `User-Agent` header in HTTP requests with the API server. ([#6153](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6153))

### Bug Fixes

- Ensure the former primary flushes its WAL file queue to the archive before
  re-synchronizing as a replica, reducing recovery times and enhancing data
  consistency during failovers. ([#6141](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6141))
- Clean the WAL volume along with the `PGDATA` volume during bootstrap. ([#6265](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6265))
- Update the operator to set the cluster phase to `Unrecoverable` when
  all previously generated `PersistentVolumeClaims` are missing. ([#6170](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6170))
- Fix the parsing of the `synchronous_standby_names` GUC when
  `.spec.postgresql.synchronous.method` is set to `first`. ([#5955](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/5955))
- Resolved a potential race condition when patching certain conditions
  in CRD statuses, improving reliability in concurrent updates. ([#6328](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6328))
- Correct role changes to apply at the transaction level instead of the
  database context. ([#6064](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6064))
- Remove the `primary_slot_name` definition from the `override.conf` file on
  the primary to ensure it is always empty. ([#6219](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6219))
- Configure libpq environment variables, including `PGHOST`, in PgBouncer pods
  to enable seamless access to the `pgbouncer` virtual database using `psql`
  from within the container. ([#6247](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6247))
- Prevent panic during recovery from an external server without proper backup
  configuration. ([#6300](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6300))
- Resolved a key collision issue in structured logs, where the name field was
  inconsistently used to log two distinct values. ([#6324](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6324))
- Ensure proper quoting of the inRoles field in SQL statements to prevent
  syntax errors in generated SQL during role management. ([#6346](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6346))
- `cnpg` plugin:
    - Ensure the `kubectl` context is properly passed in the `psql` command. ([#6257](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/6257))
    - Avoid displaying physical backups block when empty with `status` command. ([#5998](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/5998))
