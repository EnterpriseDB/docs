| Type           | Description                                                                                                                        |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature | Enhance JSON log with two new loggers: wal-archive for PostgreSQL's archive_command, and wal-restore for restore_command in a standby. |
| Bug fix | Enable WAL archiving during the standby promotion (prevented .history files from being archived). |
| Bug fix | Pass the --cloud-provider option to Barman Cloud tools only when using Barman 2.13 or higher to avoid errors with older operands. |
| Bug fix | Wait for the pod of the primary to be ready before triggering a backup. |
