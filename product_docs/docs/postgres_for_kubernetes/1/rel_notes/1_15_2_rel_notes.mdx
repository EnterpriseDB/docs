| Upstream merge | Merged with community CloudNativePG 1.15.2. See the community [Release Notes](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.15/release_notes/#version-1152). |
| Enhancement    | New “stable-v1.15” channel available for OpenShift, providing update paths to the latest available patch release in the 1.15 release branch of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes. The “stable” channel is a synonym of “stable-v1.15”. See the following section for more information. |


## Important changes to our upgrade policy
We are adopting a new policy to support the last two minor versions of the product beginning with 1.16, in line with the CloudNativePG community.

As a result, we are introducing the following head versions in the new OLM channels in OpenShift to manage the update streams for EDB Postgres for Kubernetes:

* `fast`: the latest available patch release for the latest available minor release 
* `stable-v1.16`: the latest available patch release of the 1.16 minor release
* `stable-v1.15`: the latest available patch release of the 1.15 minor release

Prior to the release of 1.16, the only channel that we were supporting was the `stable` channel. This channel is now obsolete. However, for backward compatibility it is currently set as an alias of the `stable-v1.15` channel and it will be removed once version 1.15 goes End of Life.
