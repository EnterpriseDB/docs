| Upstream merge | Merged with community CloudNativePG 1.15.2. See the community [Release Notes](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/1.15/release_notes/#version-1152). |
| Enhancement    | New “stable-v1.15” channel available for OpenShift, providing update paths to the latest available patch release in the 1.15 release branch of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes. The “stable” channel is a synonym of “stable-v1.15”. See the following section for more information. |



## Important changes to our upgrade policy
We are adopting a new policy to support the last two minor versions of the product, in line with the CloudNativePG community.

As a result, we are introducing the following new OLM channels in OpenShift to manage the update streams for EDB Postgres for Kubernetes:

`”fast”: the head version in the channel is always the latest available patch release in the latest available minor release of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes
“stable-v1.15”: the head version in the channel is always the latest available patch release in the 1.15 minor release of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes

Prior to this release, the only channel that we were supporting was the “stable” channel. This channel is now obsolete. However, for back compatibility it is currently set as an alias of the “stable-v1.15” channel and it will be removed once version 1.15 goes End of Life.
