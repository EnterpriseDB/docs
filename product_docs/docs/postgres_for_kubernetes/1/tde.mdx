!!! Important
    TDE is available *only* for operands that support it:
    EPAS versions 15 and newer.

Transparent Data Encryption, or TDE, is a technology used by several database
vendors to **encrypt data at rest**, i.e. database files on disk.
TDE does not however encrypt data in use.

TDE is included in EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS), starting with version
15, and it is supported by the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator.

!!! Important
    Before you proceed, please take some time to familiarize with the
    [TDE feature in the EPAS documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/tde/latest/).

With TDE activated, both WAL files and files for tables will be encrypted.
Data encryption/decryption is entirely transparent to the user, as it is
managed by the database without requiring any application changes or updated
client drivers.

EDB Postgres for Kubernetes provides 3 ways to use TDE:

-   using a secret containing the passphrase
-   using a secret containing a custom passphrase command
-   using a pair of secrets containing custom wrap/unwrap commands

## Passphrase secret

The basic approach is to store the passphrase in a Kubernetes secret. Such a
passphrase will be used to encrypt the EPAS binary key.

!!! Seealso "EPAS documentation"
    Please refer to [the EPAS documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/tde/latest/key_stores/)
    for details on the EPAS encryption key.

Activating TDE on the operator is simple. In the `epas` section of the manifest,
use the `tde` stanza to enable TDE, and set the Kubernetes secret that
will hold the TDE encryption key.

For example:

```yaml
  […]
  postgresql:
    epas:
      tde:
        enabled: true
        secretKeyRef:
          name: tde-key
          key: key
```

You can find an example in [`cluster-example-tde.yaml`](../samples/cluster-example-tde.yaml).

!!! Note
    This file also contains the definition of the secret to hold the encryption
    key. Look at the following section for an example on how to create a secret
    for this purpose.

The key stored in the secret will be used as the pass-phrase to invoke
`openssl` to wrap/unwrap the EPAS encryption key.

### How to create the secret containing the passphrase

First choose the passphrase. While it is recommended to use a randomly
generated passphrase, in this example we will use `PostgresRocks` as
passphrase, and rely on `kubectl` to generate for us the secret definition:

```shell
kubectl create secret generic -o yaml tde-key \
    --from-literal=key=PostgresRocks
```

This should return something like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  key: UG9zdGdyZXNSb2Nrcw==
kind: Secret
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ"
  name: tde-key
  namespace: default
  resourceVersion: ....
  uid: ....
type: Opaque
```

Remember to run `kubectl apply` or remove the `-o yaml` option to the `create`
command above to actually create the secret in the cluster.

## Custom passphrase command

Instead of the `secretKeyRef` in the cluster manifest snippet above, it is
possible to specify a `passphraseCommand` stored in a secret. The passphrase
command can be run to generate a passphrase to be used with `openssl`.

```yaml
  […]
  postgresql:
    epas:
      tde:
        enabled: true
        passphraseCommand:
          name: tde-passphrase
          key: command
```

The passphrase command should write to standard output.
For example, we could simply use `echo my-passphrase`.

The passphrase generated by the command will be used the same way the
secretKeyRef was used, i.e. as a passphrase argument for `openssl`.

## Custom wrap/unwrap commands

It is also possible to specify the wrap and unwrap commands, rather than rely
on the default invocation of `openssl`.
This can be done by creating secrets containing the custom commands, and
declaring those secrets in the `tde` stanza.

The snippet below shows a cluster with TDE enabled using custom commands.

```yaml
  […]
  postgresql:
    epas:
      tde:
        enabled: true
        wrapCommand:
          name: tde-wrap-command
          key: command
        unwrapCommand:
          name: tde-unwrap-command
          key: command
```

The custom commands need to obey the following conventions:

1.  The custom wrap command should accept input from standard input, which EPAS
    will use to feed it the binary key. It should write to a file via an explicit
    argument (not shell redirections). Moreover, the file argument
    should be given the string "%p", which is a placeholder EPAS will use to
    pass the file path of the new, wrapped encryption key file.

2.  The custom unwrap command should write to standard output. It should have
    an explicit file path argument for input (not shell redirections).
    Again, the file argument should be given the string "%p", which is the
    placeholder EPAS will fill in with the wrapped encryption key file path.

For example:

-   wrap command: `openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -pass pass:temp-pass -e -out %p`
-   unwrap command: `openssl enc -aes-128-cbc -pass pass:temp-pass -d -in %p`
