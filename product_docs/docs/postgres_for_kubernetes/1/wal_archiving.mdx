WAL archiving is the process that feeds a [WAL archive](backup.md#wal-archive)
in EDB Postgres for Kubernetes.

!!! Important
    All new deployments are strongly encouraged to adopt the plugin-based
    architecture, which offers a more flexible and maintainable approach.

If you are currently using the native `.spec.backup.barmanObjectStore`
approach, refer to the official guide for a smooth transition:
[Migrating from Built-in {{name.ln}} Backup](https://cloudnative-pg.io/plugin-barman-cloud/docs/migration/).

## About the archive timeout

By default, {{name.ln}} sets `archive_timeout` to `5min`, ensuring
that WAL files, even in case of low workloads, are closed and archived
at least every 5 minutes, providing a deterministic time-based value for
your Recovery Point Objective ([RPO](before_you_start.md#rpo)).

Even though you change the value of the
[`archive_timeout` setting in the PostgreSQL configuration](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-ARCHIVE-TIMEOUT),
our experience suggests that the default value set by the operator is suitable
for most use cases.
