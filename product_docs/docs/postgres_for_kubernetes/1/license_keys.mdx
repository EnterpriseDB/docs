License keys are a legacy management mechanism for {{name.ln}}. You do not need a license key if you have installed using an EDB subscription token, and in this case, the licensing commands in this section can be ignored.

If you are not using an EDB subscription token and installing from public repositories, then you will need a license key. The only exception is when you run the operator with Community PostgreSQL: in this case, if the license key is unset, a cluster will be started with the default trial license - which automatically expires after 30 days. This is not the recommended way of trialing {{name.ln}} - see the [installation guide](installation_upgrade.md) for the recommended options.

!!!warning CRITICAL WARNING: UPGRADING OPERATORS
OpenShift users, or any customer attempting an operator upgrade, MUST configure the new unified repository pull secret (docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s) before running the upgrade. If the old, deprecated repository path is still in use during the upgrade process, image pull failure will occur, leading to deployment failure and potential downtime. Follow the [Central Migration Guide](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/migrating_edb_registries) first.

The following documentation is only for users who have installed the operator using a license key.

## Company level license keys

A license key allows you to create an unlimited number of PostgreSQL
clusters in your installation.

The license key needs to be available in a `Secret` in the same namespace where
the operator is deployed (`ConfigMap` is also available, but not recommended
for a license key).

!!!note Operator configuration
For more information, refer to [Operator configuration](operator_conf.md).
!!!

Once the company level license is installed, the validity of the
license key can be checked inside the cluster status.

```sh
kubectl get cluster cluster_example -o yaml
[...]
status:
  [...]
  licenseStatus:
    licenseExpiration: "2021-11-06T09:36:02Z"
    licenseStatus: Trial
    valid: true
    isImplicit: false
    isTrial: true
[...]
```

### Kubernetes installations via YAML manifest

When the operator is installed in Kubernetes using the YAML manifest,
it is deployed by default in the `postgresql-operator-system` namespace.

Given the namespace name, and the license key, you can create
the config map with the following command:

```
kubectl create configmap -n [NAMESPACE_NAME_HERE] \
    postgresql-operator-controller-manager-config \
    --from-literal=EDB_LICENSE_KEY=[LICENSE_KEY_HERE]
```

Operator pods will need to be recreated to apply the new configuration. You
can use the following command:

```sh
kubectl rollout restart deployment -n [NAMESPACE_NAME_HERE] \
    postgresql-operator-controller-manager
```

## Cluster level license keys

Each `Cluster` resource has a `licenseKey` parameter in its definition.
You can find the expiration date, as well as more information about the license,
in the cluster status:

```sh
kubectl get cluster cluster_example -o yaml
[...]
status:
  [...]
  licenseStatus:
    licenseExpiration: "2021-11-06T09:36:02Z"
    licenseStatus: Trial
    valid: true
    isImplicit: false
    isTrial: true
[...]
```

A cluster license key can be updated with a new one at any moment, to extend
the expiration date or move the cluster to a production license.

## License key secret at cluster level

Each `Cluster` resource can also have a `licenseKeySecret` parameter, which contains
the name and key of a secret. That secret contains the license key provided by EDB.

This field will take precedence over `licenseKey`: it will be refreshed
when you change the secret, in order to extend the expiration date, or switching from a trial
license to a production license.

## What happens when a license expires

After the license expiration, the operator will cease any reconciliation
attempt on the cluster, effectively stopping to manage its status. This also
includes any self-healing and high availability capabilities, such as automated
failover and switchovers.

The pods and the data will still be available.
