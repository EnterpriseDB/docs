**EDB Postgres for Kubernetes** is a stack of enterprise grade products
designed, developed, and supported by EDB to fully exploit Postgres workloads
in Kubernetes.

It currently comprises the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator which is based
on the open source CloudNativePG operator and adds EDB Postgres Advanced server
workloads with a primary/standby architecture.

EBD Postgres for Kubernetes is also available on Red Hat OpenShift.

The operator has been renamed from Cloud Native PostgreSQL.

Existing users of Cloud Native PostgreSQL will not experience any change, as
the underlying components and resources have not changed name.

INTERNAL NOTES ON WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE AND STATUS

- Explain relationship and differences with CloudNativePG
    - apiVersion: postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1 vs apiVersion: postgresql.cnpg.io/v1
    - two separate products that can co-exist


- Free evaluation (moved from existing CNP - not available in CNPG) - Done 
- Installation and upgrades (exists in CNPG - mostly refers to CNPG stuff, but needs some adaptation) - Done
- Quickstart (ditto) - Done
- OpenShift (moved from existing CNP - not available in CNPG) - Done
- Troubleshooting (points to CNPG and might add specificities about license keys or EPAS) - Copied
- End-to-End tests (exists in CNPG, integrates it with EDB suite of tests on public clouds, ...) - Copied
- License and License keys (moved from existing CNP - not available in CNPG) - Done
- API reference (entirely rewritten - done automatically from the code)
- Release notes (entirely rewritten) - To be discussed:
Added the existing CNP release notes, will be moving the 1.0 - 1.14 rel notes over as 1.15 is the first release of CloudNativePG. Seems like the 1.15 release notes for CloudNativePG should say initial release and starting with 1.16, the CloudNativePG lists the changes that aren't done in the EDB product and the EDB product release notes should just list the things EDB adds like OpenShift changes. The first row of the EDB release notes would be:
| Upstream merge | Merged with community CloudNativePG 1.16.0. See the community [Release Notes](https://cloudnative-pg.io/docs/1.16.0/release_notes/) for details. |
