EDB Postgres for Kubernetes is an operator designed, developed, and supported
by EDB that covers the full lifecycle of a highly available Postgres database
clusters with a primary/standby architecture, using native streaming
replication.

It is based on the [open source CloudNativePG operator](https://cloudnative-pg.io),
and provides additional value such as compatibility with Oracle using EDB
Postgres Advanced Server and additional supported platforms such as IBM Power
and OpenShift. 

Key features available include:

-   Kubernetes API integration for high availability
-   Self-healing through failover and automated recreation of replicas
-   Capacity management with scale up/down capabilities
-   Planned switchovers for scheduled maintenance
-   Read-only and read-write Kubernetes services definitions
-   Rolling updates for Postgres minor versions and operator upgrades
-   Continuous backup and point-in-time recovery
-   Connection Pooling with PgBouncer
-   Integrated metrics exporter out of the box
-   PostgreSQL replication across multiple Kubernetes clusters
-   Red Hat certified operator for OpenShift

The operator has been renamed from Cloud Native PostgreSQL. Existing users of Cloud Native PostgreSQL will not experience any change, as the underlying components and resources have not changed. 

You can [evaluate EDB Postgres for Kubernetes for free](evaluation.md).
You need a valid license key to use EDB Postgres for Kubernetes in production.

!!! Note
    Based on the [Operator Capability Levels model](operator_capability_levels.md),
    users can expect a **"Level V - Auto Pilot"** set of capabilities from the
    EDB Postgres for Kubernetes Operator.

# Differences with CloudNativePG

The EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator is a fork based on CloudNativePG.

Despite both defining a custom resource called `Cluster`, they have two
different API groups. As a result, they can co-exist in the same Kubernetes
cluster. Specifically:

-   CloudNativePG uses the `postgresql.cnpg.io/v1` API version
-   EDB Postgres for Kubernetes uses the `postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1` API
    version

!!!important
    Existing EDB customers with deployments of Cloud Native PostgreSQL might
    have noticed that the API group for version 1 has not changed with the
    introduction of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes.

As a general rule, all features available in the open source CloudNativePG are
also available in EDB Postgres for Kubernetes - provided the correct API
version is used.

# Licensing

EDB Postgres for Kubernetes works with both PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres
Advanced server, and is available under the
[EDB Limited Use License](https://www.enterprisedb.com/limited-use-license).

You can [evaluate EDB Postgres for Kubernetes for free](evaluation.md).
You need a valid license key to use EDB Postgres for Kubernetes in production.

## Supported releases and Kubernetes distributions

For a list of the minor releases of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes that are
supported by EDB, please refer to the ["Supported releases"](supported_releases.md) page.
Here you can also find which Kubernetes distributions and versions are
supported for each of them and the EOL dates.

### Multiple architectures

The EDB Postgres for Kubernetes Operator container images support the multi-arch
format for the following platforms: `linux/amd64`, `linux/ppc64le`, `linux/s390x`.

!!! Warning
    EDB Postgres for Kubernetes requires that all nodes in a Kubernetes cluster have the
    same CPU architecture, thus a hybrid CPU architecture Kubernetes cluster is not
    supported. Additionally, EDB supports `linux/ppc64le` and `linux/s390x` architectures
    on OpenShift only.

## Supported Postgres versions

The following versions of Postgres are currently supported:

-   PostgreSQL 14 (default), 13, 12, 11, and 10
-   EDB Postgres Advanced 14, 13, 12, 11, and 10

All of the above versions, except PostgreSQL/EPAS 10, are available on the
following platforms: `linux/amd64`, `linux/ppc64le`, `linux/s390x`. PostgreSQL
and EPAS 10 is available on `linux/amd64` only.
EDB supports operand images for `linux/ppc64le` and `linux/s390x` architectures
on OpenShift only.

## About this guide

Follow the instructions in the ["Quickstart"](quickstart.md) to test EDB Postgres for Kubernetes
on a local Kubernetes cluster using Kind, or Minikube.

In case you are not familiar with some basic terminology on Kubernetes and PostgreSQL,
please consult the ["Before you start" section](before_you_start.md).

!!! Note
    Although the guide primarily addresses Kubernetes, all concepts can
    be extended to OpenShift as well.
