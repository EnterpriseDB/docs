EDB Postgres for Kubernetes is a stack of enterprise grade products
designed, developed, and supported by EDB to fully exploit Postgres workloads
in Kubernetes.

It currently comprises the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator which is based
on the open source CloudNativePG operator and adds EDB Postgres Advanced Server
workloads with a primary/standby architecture.

EBD Postgres for Kubernetes is also available on Red Hat OpenShift.

The operator has been renamed from Cloud Native PostgreSQL.

Existing users of Cloud Native PostgreSQL will not experience any change, as
the underlying components and resources have not changed.
