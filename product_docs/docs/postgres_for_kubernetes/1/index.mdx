The {{name.ln}} operator is a fork based on [CloudNativePG™](https://cloudnative-pg.io).
It provides additional value such as compatibility with Oracle using EDB
Postgres Advanced Server and additional supported platforms such as IBM Power
and OpenShift. It is designed, developed, and supported by EDB and covers the
full lifecycle of a highly available Postgres database clusters with a
primary/standby architecture, using native streaming replication.

!!!note

The operator has been renamed from Cloud Native PostgreSQL. Existing users
of Cloud Native PostgreSQL will not experience any change, as the underlying
components and resources have not changed.
!!!

## Key features in common with CloudNativePG™

-   Kubernetes API integration for high availability
    -   CloudNativePG™ uses the `postgresql.cnpg.io/v1` API version
    -   {{name.ln}} uses the `postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1` API version
-   Self-healing through failover and automated recreation of replicas
-   Capacity management with scale up/down capabilities
-   Planned switchovers for scheduled maintenance
-   Read-only and read-write Kubernetes services definitions
-   Rolling updates for Postgres minor versions and operator upgrades
-   Continuous backup and point-in-time recovery
-   Connection Pooling with PgBouncer
-   Integrated metrics exporter out of the box
-   PostgreSQL replication across multiple Kubernetes clusters
-   Separate volume for WAL files

## Features unique to EDB Postgres of Kubernetes

-   [Long Term Support](#long-term-support)
-   Support on IBM Power and z/Linux through partnership with IBM
-   [Oracle compatibility](/epas/latest/fundamentals/epas_fundamentals/epas_compat_ora_dev_guide/) through EDB Postgres Advanced Sever
-   [Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)](/tde/latest/) through EDB Postgres Advanced Server
-   Cold backup support with Kasten and Velero/OADP
-   Generic adapter for third-party Kubernetes backup tools

You can [evaluate {{name.ln}} for free](evaluation.md) as part of a trial subscription.
You need a valid EDB subscription to use {{name.ln}} in production.

!!!note

!!!note

Based on the [Operator Capability Levels model](operator_capability_levels.md),
users can expect a **"Level V - Auto Pilot"** set of capabilities from the
{{name.ln}} Operator.
!!!

### Long Term Support

EDB is committed to declaring a Long Term Support (LTS) version of {{name.ln}} annually. 1.25 is the current LTS version. 1.18 was the
first. Each LTS version will
receive maintenance releases and be supported for an additional 12 months beyond
the last community release of CloudNativePG for the same version.

For example, the 1.22 release of CloudNativePG reached End-of-Life on July
24, 2024, for the open source community.
Because it was declared an LTS version of {{name.ln}}, it
will be supported for an additional 12 months, until July 24, 2025.

In addition, customers will always have at least 6 months to move between LTS versions.
For example, the 1.25 LTS version was released on December 23 2024, giving ample
time to users to migrate from the 1.22 LTS ahead of the End-of-life on July 2025.

While we encourage customers to regularly upgrade to the latest version of the operator to take
advantage of new features, having LTS versions allows customers desiring additional stability to stay on the same
version for 12-18 months before upgrading.

## Licensing

{{name.ln}} works with both PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Extended and EDB Postgres
Advanced server, and is available under the
[EDB End User License Agreement](https://www.enterprisedb.com/legal/EDB-Eula).

You can [evaluate {{name.ln}} for free](evaluation.md) as part of a trial subscription.
You need a valid EDB subscription to use {{name.ln}} in production.

## Supported releases and Kubernetes distributions

For a list of the minor releases of {{name.ln}} that are
supported by EDB, please refer to the
["Platform Compatibility"](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#pgk8s)
page. Here you can also find which Kubernetes distributions and versions are
supported for each of them and the EOL dates.

### Multiple architectures

The {{name.ln}} Operator container images support the multi-arch
format for the following platforms: `linux/amd64`, `linux/arm64`, `linux/ppc64le`, `linux/s390x`.

!!!warning

{{name.ln}} requires that all nodes in a Kubernetes cluster have the
same CPU architecture, thus a hybrid CPU architecture Kubernetes cluster is not
supported. Additionally, EDB supports `linux/ppc64le` and `linux/s390x` architectures
on OpenShift only.
!!!

## Supported Postgres versions

The following versions of Postgres are currently supported by version 1.25:

-   PostgreSQL: 13 - 17
-   EDB Postgres Advanced: 13 - 17
-   EDB Postgres Extended: 13 - 17

PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced are available on the following platforms:
`linux/amd64`, `linux/ppc64le`, `linux/s390x`.  
In addition, PostgreSQL is also supported on `linux/arm64`.  
EDB Postgres Extended is supported only on `linux/amd64`.  
EDB supports operand images for `linux/ppc64le` and `linux/s390x` architectures
on OpenShift only.

## About this guide

Follow the instructions in the ["Quickstart"](quickstart.md) to test {{name.ln}}
on a local Kubernetes cluster using Kind, or Minikube.

In case you are not familiar with some basic terminology on Kubernetes and PostgreSQL,
please consult the ["Before you start" section](before_you_start.md).

!!!note

Although the guide primarily addresses Kubernetes, all concepts can
be extended to OpenShift as well.
