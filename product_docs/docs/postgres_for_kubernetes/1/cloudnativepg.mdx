title: 'Differences with CloudNativePG'
product: 'EDB Postgres for Kubernetes'
---

The EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator is a fork based on CloudNativePG.

Despite both defining a customer resource called `Cluster`, they have two
different API groups. As a result, they can co-exist in the same Kubernetes
cluster. Specifically:

- CloudNativePG uses the `postgresql.cnpg.io/v1` API version
- EDB Postgres for Kubernetes uses the `postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1` API version

!!!important
Existing EDB customers with deployments of Cloud Native PostgreSQL might have noticed that the API group for version 1 has not changed with the introduction of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes.
!!!

As a general rule, all features available in the open source CloudNativePG are
also available in EDB Postgres for Kubernetes - provided the correct API
version is used.

For this reason, we refer to the CloudNativePG for detailed information on the
available features.
