The EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator for Kubernetes is designed to
work with any compatible container image of PostgreSQL that complies
with the following requirements:

-   PostgreSQL executables that must be in the path:
    -   `initdb`
    -   `postgres`
    -   `pg_ctl`
    -   `pg_controldata`
    -   `pg_basebackup`
-   Barman Cloud executables that must be in the path:
    -   `barman-cloud-backup`
    -   `barman-cloud-backup-delete`
    -   `barman-cloud-backup-list`
    -   `barman-cloud-check-wal-archive`
    -   `barman-cloud-restore`
    -   `barman-cloud-wal-archive`
    -   `barman-cloud-wal-restore`
-   PGAudit extension installed (optional - only if PGAudit is required
    in the deployed clusters)
-   Appropriate locale settings

!!! Important
    Only [PostgreSQL versions supported by the PGDG](https://postgresql.org/) are allowed.

No entry point and/or command is required in the image definition, as
EDB Postgres for Kubernetes overrides it with its instance manager.

!!! Warning
    Application Container Images will be used by EDB Postgres for Kubernetes
    in a **Primary with multiple/optional Hot Standby Servers Architecture**
    only.

EDB provides and supports
[public PostgreSQL container images](https://github.com/enterprisedb/docker-postgres)
for EDB Postgres for Kubernetes, and publishes them on
[quay.io](https://quay.io/enterprisedb/postgresql).

## Image tag requirements

While the image name can be anything valid for Docker, the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes
operator relies on the *image tag* to detect the Postgres major
version contained in the image.

The image tag must start with a valid PostgreSQL major version number (e.g.
14.5 or 15) optionally followed by a dot and the patch level.

This can be followed by any character combination that is valid and
accepted in a Docker tag, preceded by a dot, an underscore, or a minus sign.

Examples of accepted image tags:

-   `11.1`
-   `12.3.2.1-1`
-   `12.4`
-   `13`
-   `14.5-10`
-   `15.0`

!!! Warning
    `latest` is not considered a valid tag for the image.
