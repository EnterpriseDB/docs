The {{name.ln}} operator for Kubernetes is designed to work with any
compatible PostgreSQL container image that meets the following requirements:

-   PostgreSQL executables must be available in the system path:
    -   `initdb`
    -   `postgres`
    -   `pg_ctl`
    -   `pg_controldata`
    -   `pg_basebackup`
-   Proper locale settings configured

Optional Components:

-   [PGAudit](https://www.pgaudit.org/) extension (only required if audit logging
    is needed)
-   `du` (used for `kubectl cnp status`)

!!! Important
    Only [PostgreSQL versions officially supported by PGDG](https://postgresql.org/) are allowed.

!!! Info
    Barman Cloud executables are no longer required in {{name.ln}}. The
    recommended approach is to use the dedicated [Barman Cloud Plugin](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/plugin-barman-cloud).

No entry point or command is required in the image definition. {{name.ln}}
automatically overrides it with its instance manager.

!!! Warning
    {{name.ln}} only supports **Primary with multiple/optional Hot Standby
    Servers architecture** for PostgreSQL application container images.

EDB provides and maintains
[public PostgreSQL container images](https://github.com/enterprisedb/docker-postgres)
that are fully compatible with {{name.ln}}. These images are published on
[quay.io](https://quay.io/enterprisedb/postgresql).

## Image Tag Requirements

To ensure the operator makes informed decisions, it must accurately detect the
PostgreSQL major version. This detection can occur in two ways:

1.  Utilizing the `major` field of the `imageCatalogRef`, if defined.
2.  Auto-detecting the major version from the image tag of the `imageName` if
    not explicitly specified.

For auto-detection to work, the image tag must adhere to a specific format. It
should commence with a valid PostgreSQL major version number (e.g., 15.6 or
16), optionally followed by a dot and the patch level.

Following this, the tag can include any character combination valid and
accepted in a Docker tag, preceded by a dot, an underscore, or a minus sign.

Examples of accepted image tags:

-   `12.1`
-   `13.3.2.1-1`
-   `13.4`
-   `14`
-   `15.5-10`
-   `16.0`

!!! Warning
    `latest` is not considered a valid tag for the image.

!!! Note
    Image tag requirements do not apply for images defined in a catalog.
