Refer to the [Installation and upgrades](https://cloudnative-pg.io/docs/1.15.0/installation_upgrade/) topic in the CloudNativePG documentation and use this topic for specifics regarding EDB Postgres for Kubernetes usage.

!!! Tip "Live demonstration"
    Don't want to install anything locally just yet? Try a demonstration directly in your browser:

    [EDB Postgres for Kubernetes Operator Interactive Quickstart](interactive_demo)

<!-- end inserted section -->

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform users can test the certified operator for
EDB Postgres for Kubernetes on the [Red Hat CodeReady Containers (CRC)](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers/overview)
for OpenShift.

!!! Warning
    The instructions contained in this section are for demonstration,
    testing, and practice purposes only and must not be used in production.

Like any other Kubernetes application, EDB Postgres for Kubernetes is deployed using
regular manifests written in YAML.

By following these instructions you should be able to start a PostgreSQL
cluster on your local Kubernetes/Openshift installation and experiment with it.

!!! Important
    Make sure that you have `kubectl` installed on your machine in order
    to connect to the Kubernetes cluster, or `oc` if using CRC for OpenShift.
    Please follow the Kubernetes documentation on [how to install `kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/)
    or the Openshift documentation on [how to install `oc`](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html).

!!! Note
    If you are running Openshift, use `oc` every time `kubectl` is mentioned
    in this documentation. `kubectl` commands are compatible with `oc` ones.

## Part 1 - Setup the local Kubernetes/Openshift playground

This section covers the installation of CRC. For Kind or Minikube, refer
to the upstream documentation for CloudNativePG.

### CodeReady Containers (CRC)

1. [Download Red Hat CRC](https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers/overview)
and move the binary inside a directory in your `PATH`.

1. Run the following commands:

   ```
   crc setup
   crc start
   ```

   The `crc start` output explains how to proceed. 
   
1. Execute the output of the `crc oc-env` command.
1. Log in as `kubeadmin` with the printed `oc login`
command. You can also open the web console running `crc console`.
User and password are the same as for the `oc login` command.

1. CRC doesn't come with a StorageClass, so one has to be configured. Follow the [Dynamic volume provisioning wiki page](https://github.com/code-ready/crc/wiki/Dynamic-volume-provisioning)
and install `rancher/local-path-provisioner`.

## Part 2 - Install EDB Postgres for Kubernetes

Now that you have a Kubernetes or OpenShift installation up and running
on your laptop, you can proceed with EDB Postgres for Kubernetes installation.

Refer to the [Installation and upgrades](https://cloudnative-pg.io/docs/1.15.0/installation_upgrade/) topic in the CloudNativePG documentation and then proceed
with the deployment of a PostgreSQL cluster.

## Part 3 - Deploy a PostgreSQL cluster

As with any other deployment in Kubernetes, to deploy a PostgreSQL cluster
you need to apply a configuration file that defines your desired `Cluster`.

The [`cluster-example.yaml`](../samples/cluster-example.yaml) sample file
defines a simple `Cluster` using the default storage class to allocate
disk space:

```yaml
# Example of PostgreSQL cluster
apiVersion: postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-example
spec:
  instances: 3

  # Require 1Gi of space
  storage:
    size: 1Gi
```

!!! Note "There's more"
    For more detailed information about the available options, refer
    to [API Reference(api_reference.md).
