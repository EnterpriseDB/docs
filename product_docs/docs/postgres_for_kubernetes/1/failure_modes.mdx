{{name.ln}} adheres to standard Kubernetes principles for self-healing and
high availability. We assume familiarity with core Kubernetes concepts such as
storage classes, PVCs, nodes, and Pods. For {{name.ln}}-specific details,
refer to the ["Postgres Instance Manager" section](instance_manager.md), which
covers startup, liveness, and readiness probes, as well as the
[self-healing](#self-healing) section below.

!!!info Important
If you are running {{name.ln}} in production, we strongly recommend
seeking [professional support](https://cloudnative-pg.io/support/).

## Self-Healing

### Primary Failure

If the primary Pod fails:

-   The operator promotes the most up-to-date standby with the lowest replication
    lag.
-   The `-rw` service is updated to point to the new primary.
-   The failed Pod is removed from the `-r` and `-rw` services.
-   Standby Pods begin replicating from the new primary.
-   The former primary uses `pg_rewind` to re-synchronize if its PVC is available;
    otherwise, a new standby is created from a backup of the new primary.

### Standby Failure

If a standby Pod fails:

-   It is removed from the `-r` and `-ro` services.
-   The Pod is restarted using its PVC if available; otherwise, a new Pod is
    created from a backup of the current primary.
-   Once ready, the Pod is re-added to the `-r` and `-ro` services.

## Manual Intervention

For failure scenarios not covered by automated recovery, manual intervention
may be required.

!!!info Important
Do not perform manual operations without [professional support](https://cloudnative-pg.io/support/).
!!!

### Disabling Reconciliation

To temporarily disable the reconciliation loop for a PostgreSQL cluster, use
the `k8s.enterprisedb.io/reconciliationLoop` annotation:

```yaml
metadata:
  name: cluster-example-no-reconcile
  annotations:
    k8s.enterprisedb.io/reconciliationLoop: "disabled"
spec:
  # ...
```

Use this annotation **with extreme caution** and only during emergency
operations.

!!!warning
This annotation should be removed as soon as the issue is resolved. Leaving
it in place prevents the operator from executing self-healing actions,
including failover.
