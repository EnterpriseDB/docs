EDB Postgres for Kubernetes is available for a free evaluation.
The process is different between Vanilla/Community PostgreSQL
and EDB Postgres Advanced.

Please refer to the ["License and License keys" section](license_keys.md)
for terms and more details.

## Evaluating PostgreSQL

By default, EDB Postgres for Kubernetes installs the latest available
version of Community PostgreSQL. The operator will automatically
generate an implicit trial license for the cluster that lasts for
30 days.

This license is ideal for evaluation, proof of concept, integration with CI/CD pipelines, and so on.

PostgreSQL container images are available at
[quay.io/enterprisedb/postgresql](https://quay.io/repository/enterprisedb/postgresql).

## Evaluating EDB Postgres Advanced

You can use EDB Postgres for Kubernetes with EDB Postgres Advanced
too. You need to request a trial license key from the
[EDB website](https://cloud-native.enterprisedb.com).

EDB Postgres Advanced container images are available at
[quay.io/enterprisedb/edb-postgres-advanced](https://quay.io/repository/enterprisedb/edb-postgres-advanced).

Once you have received the license key, you can use EDB Postgres Advanced by
setting `imageName` to point to the
`quay.io/enterprisedb/edb-postgres-advanced` repository in the `spec` section
of the `Cluster` deployment configuration file.
