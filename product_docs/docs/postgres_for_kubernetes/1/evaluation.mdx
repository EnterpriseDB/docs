EDB Postgres for Kubernetes is available for a free evaluation.

The process is different between Community PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

## Evaluating using PostgreSQL

By default, EDB Postgres for Kubernetes installs the latest available
version of Community PostgreSQL.

No license key is required. The operator automatically generates an implicit trial license for the cluster that lasts for
30 days. This trial license is ideal for evaluation, proof of concept, integration with CI/CD pipelines, and so on.

PostgreSQL container images are available at [quay.io/enterprisedb/postgresql](https://quay.io/repository/enterprisedb/postgresql).

## Evaluating using EDB Postgres Advanced Server

You can use EDB Postgres for Kubernetes with EDB Postgres Advanced Server. You will need a trial key to use EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

!!!Note Obtaining your trial key
You can request a key from the **[EDB Postgres for Kubernetes Trial License Request](https://cloud-native.enterprisedb.com/trial/)** page. You will also need to be signed into your EDB Account. If you do not have an EDB Account, you can [register for one](https://www.enterprisedb.com/accounts/register) on the EDB site. 
!!!

Once you have received the license key, you can use EDB Postgres Advanced Server
by setting in the `spec` section of the `Cluster` deployment configuration file:

-   `imageName` to point to the `quay.io/enterprisedb/edb-postgres-advanced` repository
-   `licenseKey` to your license key (in the form of a string)

EDB Postgres Advanced container images are available at
[quay.io/enterprisedb/edb-postgres-advanced](https://quay.io/repository/enterprisedb/edb-postgres-advanced).

To see how `imageName` and `licenseKey` is set, refer to the [cluster-full-example](../samples/cluster-example-full.yaml) file from the the [configuration samples](samples.md) section.
