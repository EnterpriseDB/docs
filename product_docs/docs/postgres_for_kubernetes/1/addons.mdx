EDB Postgres for Kubernetes supports add-ons that can be enabled on a
per-cluster basis. These add-ons are:

1.  [External backup adapter](#external-backup-adapter)
2.  [Velero](#velero)

!!! Info
    If you are planning to use Velero in OpenShift, please refer to the
    [OADP section](openshift.md#oadp-for-velero) in the Openshift documentation.

All add-ons will automatically be available to the operator and to be used will
need to be enabled at the cluster level via the `k8s.enterprisedb.io/addons`
annotation.

## External Backup Adapter

The external backup adapter add-ons provide a generic way to integrate
EDB Postgres for Kubernetes in a third-party tool for backups through
customizable ways to identify via labels and/or annotations:

-   which PVC group to backup
-   which PVCs to exclude, in case the cluster has one or more active replicas
-   the Pod running the PostgreSQL instance that has been selected for the backup
    (a standby or, if not available, the primary)

You can choose between two add-ons that only differ from each other for the way
they allow you to configure the adapter for your backup system:

-   `external-backup-adapter`: in case you want to customize the behavior at the
    operator's configuration level via either a config map or a secret - and share
    it with all the Postgres clusters that are managed by the operator's deployment
    (see [the `external-backup-adapter` section below](#the-external-backup-adapter-add-on))
-   `external-backup-adapter-cluster`: in case you want to customize the behavior
    of the adapter at the Postgres cluster level, through a specific annotation
    (see [the `external-backup-adapter-cluster` section below](#the-external-backup-adapter-cluster-add-on))

Such add-ons allow you to define the names of the annotations that will contain
the commands to be run before or after taking a backup in the pod selected by
the operator.

As a result, any third-party backup tool for Kubernetes can rely on the above
to coordinate itself with a PostgreSQL cluster, or a set of them.

Recovery simply relies on the operator to reconcile the cluster from an
existing PVC group.

!!! Important
    The External Backup Adapter is not a tool to perform backups. It simply
    provides a generic interface that any third-party backup tool in the Kubernetes
    space can use. Such tools are responsible for safely storing the PVC
    and/or the content, and make it available at recovery time together with
    all the necessary resource definitions of your Kubernetes cluster.

### Customizing the adapter

As mentioned above, the adapter can be configured in two ways, which then
determines the actual `add-on` you need to use in your `Cluster` resource.

If you are planning to define the same behavior for all the Postgres `Cluster`
resources managed by the operator, we recommend that you use the
`external-backup-adapter` add-on, and configure the annotations/labels in the
operator's configuration.

If you are planning to have different behaviors for a subset of the Postgres
`Cluster` resources that you have, we recommend that you use the
`external-backup-adapter-cluster` add-on.

Both add-ons share the same capabilities in terms of customization, which needs
to be defined as a YAML object having the following keys:

-   `electedResourcesDecorators`
-   `excludedResourcesDecorators`
-   `backupInstanceDecorators`
-   `preBackupHookConfiguration`
-   `postBackupHookConfiguration`

Each section is explained below. Further down you'll find the instructions on
how to customize each of the two add-ons, with some examples.

#### The `electedResourcesDecorators` section

This section allows you to configure an array of labels and/or annotations that
will be put on every elected PVC group.

Each element of the array must have the following fields:

`key`
: the name of the key for the label or annotation

`metadataType`
: the type of metadata, either `"label"` or `"annotation"`

`value`
: the value that will be assigned to the label or annotation

#### The `excludedResourcesDecorators` section

This section allows you to configure an array of labels and/or annotations that
will be placed on every excluded pod and PVC.

Each element of the array must have the same fields as the
`electedResourcesDecorators` section above.

#### The `backupInstanceDecorators` section

This section allows you to configure an array of labels and/or annotations that
will be placed on the instance that has been selected for the backup by the operator
and which contains the hooks to be run.

Each element of the array must have the same fields as the
`electedResourcesDecorators` section above.

#### The `preBackupHookConfiguration` section

This section allows you to control the names of the annotations in which the
operator will place the name of the container, the command to run before taking
the backup, and the command to run in case of error/abort on the third-party
tool side. Such metadata will be applied on the instance that's been selected by
the operator for the backup (see `backupInstanceDecorators` above).

The following fields must be provided:

`container`
: Specifies where to place the information about the container
  that will run the pre-backup command. The container name is a fixed value and
  cannot be configured. Will be saved in the annotations. To decorate the pod
  with hooks refer to: `instanceWithHookDecorators`

`command`
: Specifies where to place the information about the command that
  will be executed before the backup is taken. The command that will be
  executed is a fixed value and cannot be configured. Will be saved in the
  annotations. To decorate the pod with hooks refer to:
  `instanceWithHookDecorators`

`onError`
: Specifies where to place the information about the command that
  will be executed in case of an error. The command that will be executed is a
  fixed value and cannot be configured. Will be saved in the annotations. To
  decorate the pod with hooks refer to: `instanceWithHookDecorators`

#### The `postBackupHookConfiguration` section

This section allows you to control the names of the annotations in which the
operator will place the name of the container and the command to run after taking
the backup. Such metadata will be applied on the instance that's been selected by
the operator for the backup (see `backupInstanceDecorators` above).

The following fields must be provided:

`container`
: Specifies where to place the information about the container
  that will run the post-backup command. The container name is a fixed value
  and cannot be configured. Will be saved in the annotations. To decorate the pod
  with hooks refer to: `instanceWithHookDecorators`

`command`
: Specifies where to place the information about the command that
  will be executed after the backup is taken. The command that will be executed
  is a fixed value and cannot be configured. Will be saved in the annotations. To
  decorate the pod with hooks refer to: `instanceWithHookDecorators`

### The `external-backup-adapter` add-on

The `external-backup-adapter` add-on can be entirely configured at operator's
level via the `EXTERNAL_BACKUP_ADDON_CONFIGURATION` field in the operator's
`ConfigMap`/`Secret`.

For more information, please refer to the provided sample file at the end of
this section, or the example below:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: postgresql-operator-controller-manager-config
  namespace: postgresql-operator-system
data:
  # ...
  EXTERNAL_BACKUP_ADDON_CONFIGURATION: |-
    electedResourcesDecorators:
      - key: "app.example.com/elected"
        metadataType: "label"
        value: "true"
    excludedResourcesDecorators:
      - key: "app.example.com/excluded"
        metadataType: "label"
        value: "true"
      - key: "app.example.com/excluded-reason"
        metadataType: "annotation"
        value: "Not necessary for backup"
    backupInstanceDecorators:
      - key: "app.example.com/hasHooks"
        metadataType: "label"
        value: "true"
    preBackupHookConfiguration:
      container:
        key: "app.example.com/pre-backup-container"
      command:
        key: "app.example.com/pre-backup-command"
      onError:
        key: "app.example.com/pre-backup-on-error"
    postBackupHookConfiguration:
      container:
        key: "app.example.com/post-backup-container"
      command:
        key: "app.example.com/post-backup-command"
```

The add-on can be activated by adding the following annotation to the `Cluster`
resource:

```yaml
k8s.enterprisedb.io/addons: '["external-backup-adapter"]'
```

### The `external-backup-adapter-cluster` add-on

The `external-backup-adapter-cluster` add-on must be configured in each
`Cluster` resource you intend to use it through the
`k8s.enterprisedb.io/externalBackupAdapterClusterConfig` annotation - which
accepts the YAML object as content - as outlined in the following example:

```yaml
apiVersion: postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-example
  annotations:
    "k8s.enterprisedb.io/addons": '["external-backup-adapter-cluster"]'
    "k8s.enterprisedb.io/externalBackupAdapterClusterConfig": |-
      electedResourcesDecorators:
        - key: "app.example.com/elected"
          metadataType: "label"
          value: "true"
      excludedResourcesDecorators:
        - key: "app.example.com/excluded"
          metadataType: "label"
          value: "true"
        - key: "app.example.com/excluded-reason"
          metadataType: "annotation"
          value: "Not necessary for backup"
      backupInstanceDecorators:
        - key: "app.example.com/hasHooks"
          metadataType: "label"
          value: "true"
      preBackupHookConfiguration:
        container:
          key: "app.example.com/pre-backup-container"
        command:
          key: "app.example.com/pre-backup-command"
        onError:
          key: "app.example.com/pre-backup-on-error"
      postBackupHookConfiguration:
        container:
          key: "app.example.com/post-backup-container"
        command:
          key: "app.example.com/post-backup-command"
spec:
  instances: 3
  storage:
    size: 1Gi
```

### About the fencing annotation

If the configured external backup adapter backs up annotations, the fencing
annotation will be set by the pre-backup hook and persist to the restored
cluster. After restoring the cluster, you will need to manually remove the
fencing annotation from the `Cluster` object to fix this.

This can be done with the `cnp` plugin for kubectl:

```shell
kubectl cnp fencing off <cluster-name>
```

Or, if you don't have the `cnp` plugin, you can remove the fencing annotation
manually with the following command:

```shell
kubectl annotate cluster <cluster-name> k8s.enterprisedb.io/fencedInstances-
```

Please refer to the [fencing documentation](fencing.md) for more information.

### Limitations

As far as the backup part is concerned, currently, the EDB Postgres for
Kubernetes integration with `external-backup-adapter` and
`external-backup-adapter-cluster` supports **cold backups** only. These are
also referred to as **offline backups**. This means that the selected replica
is temporarily fenced so that `external-backup-adapter` and
`external-backup-adapter-cluster` can take a physical snapshot of the PVC group -
namely the `PGDATA` volume and, where available, the WAL volume.

In this short timeframe, the standby cannot accept read-only connections.
If no standby is available - usually because we're in a single instance cluster -
and the annotation `k8s.enterprisedb.io/snapshotAllowColdBackupOnPrimary` is
set to true, `external-backup-adapter` and `external-backup-adapter-cluster`
will temporarily fence the primary, causing downtime in terms of read-write
operations. This use case is normally left to development environments.

#### Full example of YAML file

Here is a full example of YAML content to be placed in either:

-   the `EXTERNAL_BACKUP_ADDON_CONFIGURATION` option as part of the
    the operator's configuration process described above for the
    `external-backup-adapter` add-on, or
-   in the `k8s.enterprisedb.io/externalBackupAdapterClusterConfig` annotation
    for the `external-backup-adapter-cluster` add-on

!!! Hint
    Copy the content below and paste it inside the `ConfigMap` or `Secret` that
    you use to configure the operator or the annotation in the `Cluster`, making
    sure you use the `|` character that [YAML reserves for literals](https://yaml.org/spec/1.2.2/#812-literal-style),
    as well as proper indentation. Use the comments to help you customize the
    options for your tool.

```

## Velero

Velero is an open-source tool to safely back up, restore, perform disaster
recovery, and migrate Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes. For
more information, see the [Velero documentation](https://velero.io/docs/latest/).
To enable Velero compatibility with an EDB Postgres for Kubernetes Cluster, add
the `velero` value to the `k8s.enterprisedb.io/addons` annotation in a Cluster
spec.
For example:

```yaml
 kind: Cluster
 metadata:
   name: one-instance
   annotations:
      k8s.enterprisedb.io/addons: '["velero"]'
      k8s.enterprisedb.io/snapshotAllowColdBackupOnPrimary: enabled
 spec:
   instances: 1
   storage:
     size: 1Gi
   walStorage:
     size: 1Gi
```

Once the cluster is created and healthy, the operator will select the farthest
ahead replica instance to be the designated backup and will add Velero-specific
backup hooks as annotations to that instance.

These [annotations](https://velero.io/docs/latest/backup-hooks/) are used by
Velero to run the commands to prepare the Postgres instance to be backed up.

!!! Important
    The operator will refuse to shut down a primary instance to take a cold
    backup unless the Cluster is annotated with
    `k8s.enterprisedb.io/snapshotAllowColdBackupOnPrimary: enabled`.

### Limitations

As far as the backup part is concerned, currently, the EDB Postgres for
Kubernetes integration with Velero supports **cold backups** only. These are
also referred to as **offline backups**. This means that the selected replica
is temporarily fenced so that external-backup-adapter can take a physical
snapshot of the PVC group - namely the `PGDATA` volume and, where available,
the WAL volume.

In this short timeframe, the standby cannot accept read-only connections.
If no standby is available - usually because we're in a single instance cluster -
and the annotation `k8s.enterprisedb.io/snapshotAllowColdBackupOnPrimary` is
set to true, Velero will temporarily fence the primary, causing downtime in
terms of read-write operations. This use case is normally left to development
environments.

In terms of recovery, the integration with Velero supports snapshot recovery
only. No Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) is available at the moment with the
Velero add-on, and RPO is determined by the frequency of the snapshots in your
Velero environment. If your organization relies on Velero, this usually is
acceptable, but if you need PITR we recommend you look at the native continuous
backup method on object stores.

### Backup

By design, EDB Postgres for Kubernetes offloads as much of the backup
functionality to Velero as possible, with the only requirement to make
available the previously mentioned backup hooks. Since EDB Postgres for
Kubernetes transparently sets all the needed configurations, and the rest is
standard Velero, using Velero to backup a Postgres cluster is as
straightforward as it would be for any other object. For example:

```bash
velero backup create mybackup \
  --include-namespaces mynamespace \
  -n velero-install-namespace
```

This command will create a standard Velero backup using the configured object
storage and the configured Snapshot API.

!!! Important
    By default, the Velero add-on exclude only a few resources from the backup
    operation, namely pods and PVCs of the instances that have not been selected
    (as you recall, the operator tries to backup the PVCs of the first replica).
    However, you can use the options for the `velero backup` command to fine tune
    the resources you want to be part of your backup.

### Restore

As with backup, the recovery process is a standard Velero procedure. The
command to restore from a backup created with the above parameters would be:

```bash
velero create restore myrestore \
  --from-backup mybackup \
  -n velero-install-namespace
```
