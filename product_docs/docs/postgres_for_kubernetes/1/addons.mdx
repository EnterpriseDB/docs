EDB Postgres for Kubernetes supports add-ons that can be enabled on a
per-cluster basis. These add-ons are:

1.  [Velero](#velero)

!!! Info
    If you are planning to use Velero in OpenShift, please refer to the
    [OADP section](openshift.md#oadp-for-velero) in the Openshift documentation.

All add-ons will automatically be available to the operator and to be used will
need to be enabled at the cluster level via the `k8s.enterprisedb.io/addons`
annotation.

## Velero

Velero is an open-source tool to safely back up and restores, perform disaster
recovery, and migrate Kubernetes cluster resources and persistent volumes. For
more information, see the [Velero documentation](https://velero.io/docs/latest/).
To enable Velero compatibility with an EDB Postgres for Kubernetes Cluster, add
the `velero` value to the `k8s.enterprisedb.io/addons` annotation in a Cluster
spec.
For example:

```yaml
 kind: Cluster
 metadata:
   name: one-instance
   annotations:
      k8s.enterprisedb.io/addons: '["velero"]'
      k8s.enterprisedb.io/snapshotAllowColdBackupOnPrimary: enabled
 spec:
   instances: 1
   storage:
     size: 1Gi
   walStorage:
     size: 1Gi
```

Once the cluster is created and healthy, the operator will select the farthest
ahead replica instance to be the designated backup and will add Velero-specific
backup hooks as annotations to that instance.

These [annotations](https://velero.io/docs/latest/backup-hooks/) are used by
Velero to run the commands to prepare the Postgres instance to be backed up.

!!! Important
    The operator will refuse to shut down a primary instance to take a cold
    backup unless the Cluster is annotated with
    `k8s.enterprisedb.io/snapshotAllowColdBackupOnPrimary: enabled`.

### Limitations

As far as the backup part is concerned, currently, the EDB Postgres for
Kubernetes integration with Velero supports **cold backups** only. These are also
referred to as **offline backups**. This means that the selected replica is
temporarily fenced so that Velero can take a physical snapshot of the `PGDATA`
volume and, where available, the WAL volume.
In this short timeframe, the standby cannot accept read-only connections.
If no standby is available - usually because we're in a single instance cluster

-   Velero will temporarily fence the primary, causing downtime in terms of
    read-write operations. This use case is normally left to development
    environments.

In terms of recovery, the integration with Velero supports snapshot recovery
only. No Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) is available at the moment with the
Velero add-on, and RPO is determined by the frequency of the snapshots in your
Velero environment. If your organization relies on Velero, this usually is
acceptable, but if you need PITR we recommend you look at the native continuous
backup method on object stores.

### Backup

By design, EDB Postgres for Kubernetes offloads as much of the backup
functionality to Velero as possible, with the only requirement to make
available the previously mentioned backup hooks. Since EDB Postgres for
Kubernetes transparently sets all the needed configurations, and the rest is
standard Velero, using Velero to backup a Postgres cluster is as
straightforward as it would be for any other object. For example:

```bash
velero backup create mybackup \
  --include-namespaces mynamespace \
  -n velero-install-namespace
```

This command will create a standard Velero backup using the configured object
storage and the configured Snapshot API.

!!! Important
    By default, the Velero add-on exclude only a few resources from the backup
    operation, namely pods and PVCs of the instances that have not been selected
    (as you recall, the operator tries to backup the PVCs of the first replica).
    However, you can use the options for the `velero backup` command to fine tune
    the resources you want to be part of your backup.

### Restore

As with backup, the recovery process is a standard Velero procedure. The
command to restore from a backup created with the above parameters would be:

```bash
velero create restore myrestore \
  --from-backup mybackup \
  -n velero-install-namespace
```
