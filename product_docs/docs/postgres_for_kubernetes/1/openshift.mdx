EDB Postgres for Kubernetes is certified to run on
[Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) version 4.x](https://www.openshift.com/products/container-platform)
and is available directly from the
[Red Hat Catalog](https://catalog.redhat.com/software/operators/detail/5fb41c88abd2a6f7dbe1b37b).

The goal of this section is to help you decide the best installation method for
EDB Postgres for Kubernetes based on your organizations' security and access
control policies.

The first and critical step is to design the [architecture](#architecture) of
your PostgreSQL clusters in your OpenShift environment.

Once the architecture is clear, you can proceed with the installation. EDB
Postgres for Kubernetes can be installed and managed via:

-   [OpenShift web console](#installation-via-web-console)
-   [OpenShift command-line interface (CLI)](#installation-via-the-oc-cli) called `oc`, for full control

EDB Postgres for Kubernetes supports all available install modes defined by
OpenShift:

-   cluster-wide, in all namespaces
-   local, in a single namespace
-   local, watching multiple namespaces (only available using `oc`)

!!! Note
    A project is a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations, and is the
    central vehicle by which access to resources for regular users is managed.

In most cases, the default cluster-wide installation of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes
is the recommended one, with either central management of PostgreSQL clusters
or delegated management (limited to specific users/projects according to RBAC
definitions - see ["Important OpenShift concepts"](#important-openshift-concepts)
and ["Users and Permissions"](#users-and-permissions) below).

!!! Important
    Both the installation and upgrade processes require access to an OpenShift
    Container Platform cluster using an account with `cluster-admin` permissions.
    From ["Default cluster roles"](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/authentication/using-rbac.html#default-roles_using-rbac),
    a `cluster-admin` is *"a super-user that can perform any action in any
    project. When bound to a user with a local binding, they have full control over
    quota and every action on every resource in the project"*.

## Architecture

The same concepts that have been included in the generic
[Kubernetes/PostgreSQL architecture page](architecture.md)
apply for OpenShift as well.

Here as well, the critical factor is the number of availability
zones or data centers for your OpenShift environment.

As outlined in the
["Disaster Recovery Strategies for Applications Running on OpenShift"](https://cloud.redhat.com/blog/disaster-recovery-strategies-for-applications-running-on-openshift)
blog article written by Raffaele Spazzoli back in 2020 about stateful
applications, in order to fully exploit EDB Postgres for Kubernetes, you need
to plan, design and implement an OpenShift cluster spanning 3 or more
availability zones. While this doesn't pose an issue in most of the public
cloud provider deployments, it is definitely a challenge in on-premise
scenarios.

If your OpenShift cluster has only **one availability zone**, the zone is your
Single Point of Failure (SPoF) from a High Availability standpoint - provided
that you have wisely adopted a share-nothing architecture, making sure that
your PostgreSQL clusters have at least one standby (two if using synchronous
replication), and that each PostgreSQL instance runs on a different Kubernetes
worker node using different storage. Make sure that continuous backup data is
stored additionally in a storage service outside the OpenShift cluster,
allowing you to perform Disaster Recovery operations beyond your data center.

Most likely you will have another OpenShift cluster in another data center,
either in the same metropolitan area or in another region, in an active/passive
strategy. You can set up an independent ["Replica cluster"](replica_cluster.md),
with the understanding that this is primarily a Disaster Recovery solution - very
effective but with some limitations that require manual intervention, as
explained in the feature page. The same solution can be applied to additional
OpenShift clusters, even in a cascading manner.

On the other hand, if your OpenShift cluster spans **multiple availability
zones** in a region, you can fully leverage the capabilities of the operator for
resilience and self-healing, and the region can become your SPoF, i.e.
it would take a full region outage to bring down your cluster.
Moreover, you can take advantage of multiple OpenShift clusters in different
regions by setting up replica clusters, as previously mentioned.

### Reserving Nodes for PostgreSQL Workloads

For optimal performance and resource allocation in your PostgreSQL database
operations, it is highly recommended to isolate PostgreSQL workloads by
dedicating specific worker nodes solely to `postgres` in production. This is
particularly crucial whether you're operating in a single availability zone or
a multi-availability zone environment.

A worker node in OpenShift that is dedicated to running PostgreSQL workloads is
commonly referred to as a **Postgres node** or `postgres` node.

This dedicated approach ensures that your PostgreSQL workloads are not
competing for resources with other applications, leading to enhanced stability
and performance.

For further details, please refer to the ["Reserving Nodes for PostgreSQL Workloads" section within the broader "Architecture"](architecture.md#reserving-nodes-for-postgresql-workloads)
documentation. The primary difference when working in OpenShift involves how
labels and taints are applied to the nodes, as described below.

To label a node as a `postgres` node, execute the following command:

```sh
oc label node <NODE-NAME> node-role.kubernetes.io/postgres=
```

To apply a `postgres` taint to a node, use the following command:

```sh
oc adm taint node <NODE-NAME> node-role.kubernetes.io/postgres=:NoSchedule
```

By correctly labeling and tainting your nodes, you ensure that only PostgreSQL
workloads are scheduled on these dedicated nodes via affinity and tolerations,
reinforcing the stability and performance of your database environment.

## Important OpenShift concepts

To understand how the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator fits in an OpenShift environment,
you must familiarize yourself with the following Kubernetes-related topics:

-   Operators
-   Authentication
-   Authorization via Role-based Access Control (RBAC)
-   Service Accounts and Users
-   Rules, Roles and Bindings
-   Cluster RBAC vs local RBAC through projects

This is especially true in case you are not comfortable with the elevated
permissions required by the default cluster-wide installation of the operator.

We have also selected the diagram below from the OpenShift documentation, as it
clearly illustrates the relationships between cluster roles, local roles,
cluster role bindings, local role bindings, users, groups and service accounts.

![OpenShift Cluster Roles](./images/openshift/openshift-rbac.png)
The ["Predefined RBAC objects" section](#predefined-rbac-objects)
below contains important information about how EDB Postgres for Kubernetes adheres
to Kubernetes and OpenShift RBAC implementation, covering default installed
cluster roles, roles, service accounts.

If you are familiar with the above concepts, you can proceed directly to the
selected installation method.  Otherwise, we recommend that you read the
following resources taken from the OpenShift documentation and the Red Hat
blog:

-   ["Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) concepts and resources"](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-olm.html)
-   ["Understanding authentication"](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/authentication/understanding-authentication.html)
-   ["Role-based access control (RBAC)"](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/authentication/using-rbac.html),
    covering rules, roles and bindings for authorization, as well as cluster RBAC vs local RBAC through projects
-   ["Default project service accounts and roles"](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/authentication/using-service-accounts-in-applications.html#service-accounts-default_using-service-accounts)
-   ["With Kubernetes Operators comes great responsibility" blog article](https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/kubernetes-operators-comes-great-responsibility)

### Cluster Service Version (CSV)

Technically, the operator is designed to run in OpenShift via the Operator
Lifecycle Manager (OLM), according to the Cluster Service Version (CSV) defined
by EDB.

The CSV is a YAML manifest that defines not only the user interfaces (available
through the web dashboard), but also the RBAC rules required by the operator
and the custom resources defined and owned by the operator (such as the
`Cluster` one, for example). The CSV defines also the available `installModes`
for the operator, namely: `AllNamespaces` (cluster-wide), `SingleNamespace`
(single project), `MultiNamespace` (multi-project), and `OwnNamespace`.

!!! Seealso "There's more ..."
    You can find out more about CSVs and install modes by reading
    ["Operator group membership"](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-operatorgroups.html#olm-operatorgroups-membership_olm-understanding-operatorgroups)
    and ["Defining cluster service versions (CSVs)"](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/operators/operator_sdk/osdk-generating-csvs.html)
    from the OpenShift documentation.

### Limitations for multi-tenant management

Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform provides limited support for
simultaneously installing different variations of an operator on a single
cluster. Like any other operator, EDB Postgres for Kubernetes becomes an extension
of the control plane. As the control plane is shared among all tenants
(projects) of an OpenShift cluster, operators too become shared resources in a
multi-tenant environment.

Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) can install operators multiple times in
different namespaces, with one important limitation: they all need to share the
same API version of the operator.

For more information, please refer to
["Operator groups"](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-operatorgroups.html)
in OpenShift documentation.

## Channels

Since the release of version 1.16.0, EDB Postgres for Kubernetes is available in the following
[OLM channels](https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/best-practices/channel-naming/):

-   `fast`: the head version in the channel is always the latest available patch
    release in the latest available minor release of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes
-   `stable-vX.Y`: the head version in the channel is always the latest available
    patch release in the X.Y minor release of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes

While `fast` might contain versions spanning over multiple minor versions, the
`stable-vX.Y` branches include only patch versions of the same minor release.

Considering the both CloudNativePG and EDB Postgres for Kubernetes are
developed using the *trunk development* and *continuous delivery* DevOps
principles, our recommendation is to use the `fast` channel.

### About the `stable` channel

The `stable` channel was previously used by EDB to distribute `cloud-native-postgresql`.
This channel is **obsolete** and has been removed.

If you are currently using `stable`, you have two options for moving off of it:

1.  Move to a `stable-vX.Y` channel to remain in a minor release (e.g. `stable-v1.22` would
    remain in the 1.22 minor LTS release, consuming future patch releases).
2.  Move to `fast`, which is the equivalent of `stable` before we introduced support for
    multiple minor releases

## Installation via web console

### Ensuring access to EDB private registry

!!! Important
    You'll need access to the private EDB repository where both the operator
    and operand images are stored. Access requires a valid
    [EDB subscription plan](https://www.enterprisedb.com/products/plans-comparison).
    Please refer to ["Accessing EDB private image registries"](private_edb_registries.md) for further details.

The OpenShift install will use pull secrets in order to access the
operand and operator images, which are held in a private repository.

Once you have credentials to the private repository, you will need to create
a pull secret in the `openshift-operators` namespace, named:

-   `postgresql-operator-pull-secret`, for the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator images

You can create each secret via the `oc create` command, as follows:

```sh
oc create secret docker-registry postgresql-operator-pull-secret \
  -n openshift-operators --docker-server=docker.enterprisedb.com \
  --docker-username="@@REPOSITORY@@" \
  --docker-password="@@TOKEN@@"
```

where:

-   `@@REPOSITORY@@` is the name of the repository, as explained in ["Which repository to
    choose?"](private_edb_registries.md#which-repository-to-choose)
-   `@@TOKEN@@` is the repository token for your EDB account, as explained in
    ["How to retrieve the token"](private_edb_registries.md#how-to-retrieve-the-token)

The EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator can be found in the Red Hat OperatorHub
directly from your OpenShift dashboard.

1.  Navigate in the web console to the `Operators -> OperatorHub` page:

    ![Menu OperatorHub](./images/openshift/operatorhub_1.png)

2.  Scroll in the `Database` section or type a keyword into the `Filter by keyword`
    box (in this case, "PostgreSQL") to find the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes
    Operator, then select it:

     ![Install OperatorHub](./images/openshift/operatorhub_2.png)

3.  Read the information about the Operator and select `Install`.

4.  The following `Operator installation` page expects you to choose:

    -   the installation mode: [cluster-wide](#cluster-wide-installation) or
        [single namespace](#single-project-installation) installation
    -   the update channel (see [the "Channels" section](#channels) for more
        information - if unsure, pick `fast`)
    -   the approval strategy, following the availability on the market place of
        a new release of the operator, certified by Red Hat:
    -   `Automatic`: OLM automatically upgrades the running operator with the
        new version
    -   `Manual`:  OpenShift waits for human intervention, by requiring an
        approval in the `Installed Operators` section

    !!! Important
        The process of the operator upgrade is described in the
        ["Upgrades" section](installation_upgrade.md#upgrades).

!!! Important
    It is possible to install the operator in a single project
    (technically speaking: `OwnNamespace` install mode) multiple times
    in the same cluster. There will be an operator installation in every namespace,
    with different upgrade policies as long as the API is the same (see
    ["Limitations for multi-tenant management"](#limitations-for-multi-tenant-management)).

Choosing cluster-wide vs local installation of the operator is a critical
turning point. Trying to install the operator globally with an existing local
installation is blocked, by throwing the error below. If you want to proceed
you need to remove every local installation of the operator first.

![Install failing](./images/openshift/openshift-operatorgroup-error.png)

### Cluster-wide installation

With cluster-wide installation, you are asking OpenShift to install the
Operator in the default `openshift-operators` namespace and to make it
available to all the projects in the cluster. This is the default and normally
recommended approach to install EDB Postgres for Kubernetes.

!!! Warning
    This doesn't mean that every user in the OpenShift cluster can use the EDB Postgres for
    Kubernetes Operator, deploy a `Cluster` object or even see the `Cluster` objects that
    are running in their own namespaces. There are some special roles that users must
    have in the namespace in order to interact with EDB Postgres for Kubernetes' managed
    custom resources - primarily the `Cluster` one. Please refer to the
    ["Users and Permissions" section below](#users-and-permissions) for details.

From the web console, select `All namespaces on the cluster (default)` as
`Installation mode`:

![Install all namespaces](./images/openshift/openshift-webconsole-allnamespaces.png)

As a result, the operator will be visible in every namespaces. Otherwise, as with any
other OpenShift operator, check the logs in any pods in the `openshift-operators`
project on the `Workloads → Pods` page that are reporting issues to troubleshoot further.

!!! Important "Beware"
    By choosing the cluster-wide installation you cannot easily move to a
    single project installation at a later time.

### Single project installation

With single project installation, you are asking OpenShift to install the
Operator in a given namespace, and to make it available to that project only.

!!! Warning
    This doesn't mean that every user in the namespace can use the EDB Postgres for
    Kubernetes Operator, deploy a `Cluster` object or even see the `Cluster` objects that
    are running in the namespace. Similarly to the cluster-wide installation mode,
    there are some special roles that users must have in the namespace in order to
    interact with EDB Postgres for Kubernetes' managed custom resources - primarily the `Cluster`
    one. Please refer to the ["Users and Permissions" section below](#users-and-permissions)
    for details.

From the web console, select `A specific namespace on the cluster` as
`Installation mode`, then pick the target namespace (in our example
`proj-dev`):

![Install one namespace](./images/openshift/openshift-webconsole-singlenamespace.png)

As a result, the operator will be visible in the selected namespace only. You
can verify this from the `Installed operators` page:

![Install one namespace list](./images/openshift/openshift-webconsole-singlenamespace-list.png)

In case of a problem, from the `Workloads → Pods` page check the logs in any
pods in the selected installation namespace that are reporting issues to
troubleshoot further.

!!! Important "Beware"
    By choosing the single project installation you cannot easily move to a
    cluster-wide installation at a later time.

This installation process can be repeated in multiple namespaces in the same
OpenShift cluster, enabling independent installations of the operator in
different projects. In this case, make sure you read
["Limitations for multi-tenant management"](#limitations-for-multi-tenant-management).

## Installation via the `oc` CLI

!!! Important
    Please refer to the ["Installing the OpenShift CLI" section below](#installing-the-openshift-cli-oc)
    for information on how to install the `oc` command-line interface.

Instead of using the OpenShift Container Platform web console, you can install
the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes Operator from the OperatorHub and create a
subscription using the `oc` command-line interface. Through the `oc` CLI you
can install the operator in all namespaces, a single namespace or multiple
namespaces.

!!! Warning
    Multiple namespace installation is currently supported by OpenShift.
    However, [definition of multiple target namespaces for an operator may be removed in future versions of OpenShift](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-operatorgroups.html#olm-operatorgroups-target-namespace_olm-understanding-operatorgroups).

This section primarily covers the installation of the operator in multiple
projects with a simple example, by creating an `OperatorGroup` and a
`Subscription` objects.

!!! Info
    In our example, we will install the operator in the `my-operators`
    namespace and make it only available in the `web-staging`, `web-prod`,
    `bi-staging`, and `bi-prod` namespaces. Feel free to change the names of the
    projects as you like or add/remove some namespaces.

1.  Check that the `cloud-native-postgresql` operator is available from the
    OperatorHub:

    ```
     oc get packagemanifests -n openshift-marketplace cloud-native-postgresql
    ```

2.  Inspect the operator to verify the installation modes (`MultiNamespace` in
    particular) and the available channels:

    ```
     oc describe packagemanifests -n openshift-marketplace cloud-native-postgresql
    ```

3.  Create an `OperatorGroup` object in the `my-operators` namespace so that it
    targets the `web-staging`, `web-prod`, `bi-staging`, and `bi-prod` namespaces:

    ```
     apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1
     kind: OperatorGroup
     metadata:
       name: cloud-native-postgresql
       namespace: my-operators
     spec:
       targetNamespaces:
       - web-staging
       - web-prod
       - bi-staging
       - bi-prod
    ```

     !!! Important
         Alternatively, you can list namespaces using a label selector, as explained in
         ["Target namespace selection"](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/operators/understanding/olm/olm-understanding-operatorgroups.html#olm-operatorgroups-target-namespace_olm-understanding-operatorgroups).

4.  Create a `Subscription` object in the `my-operators` namespace to subscribe
    to the `fast` channel of the `cloud-native-postgresql` operator that is
    available in the `certified-operators` source of the `openshift-marketplace`
    (as previously located in steps 1 and 2):

    ```
     apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
     kind: Subscription
     metadata:
       name: cloud-native-postgresql
       namespace: my-operators
     spec:
       channel: fast
       name: cloud-native-postgresql
       source: certified-operators
       sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
    ```

5.  Use `oc apply -f` with the above YAML file definitions for the
    `OperatorGroup` and `Subscription` objects.

The method described in this section can be very powerful in conjunction with
proper `RoleBinding` objects, as it enables mapping EDB Postgres for Kubernetes'
predefined `ClusterRole`s to specific users in selected namespaces.

!!! Info
    The above instructions can also be used for single project binding. The
    only difference is the number of specified target namespaces (one) and,
    possibly, the namespace of the operator group (ideally, the same as the target
    namespace).

The result of the above operation can also be verified from the webconsole, as
shown in the image below.

![Multi namespace installation displayed in the web console](./images/openshift/openshift-webconsole-multinamespace.png)

### Cluster-wide installation with `oc`

If you prefer, you can also use `oc` to install the operator globally, by
taking advantage of the default `OperatorGroup` called `global-operators` in
the `openshift-operators` namespace, and create a new `Subscription` object for
the `cloud-native-postgresql` operator in the same namespace:

```yaml
apiVersion: operators.coreos.com/v1alpha1
kind: Subscription
metadata:
  name: cloud-native-postgresql
  namespace: openshift-operators
spec:
  channel: fast
  name: cloud-native-postgresql
  source: certified-operators
  sourceNamespace: openshift-marketplace
```

Once you run `oc apply -f` with the above YAML file, the operator will be available in all namespaces.

### Installing the OpenShift CLI (`oc`)

The `oc` command represents the OpenShift command-line interface (CLI). It is
highly recommended to install it on your system. Below you find a basic set of
instructions to install `oc` from your OpenShift dashboard.

First, select the question mark at the top right corner of the dashboard:

![Command Line Tools menu](./images/openshift/oc_installation_screenshot_1.png)

Then follow the instructions you are given, by downloading the binary that
suits your needs in terms of operating system and architecture:

![Command Line Tools](./images/openshift/oc_installation_screenshot_2.png)

!!! Seealso "OpenShift CLI"
    For more detailed and updated information, please refer to the official
    [OpenShift CLI documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/cli_reference/openshift_cli/getting-started-cli.html)
    directly maintained by Red Hat.

## Upgrading the operator

In order to upgrade your operator safely, you need to be in a `stable-vX.Y` channel,
or the `fast` channel if you want to follow the head of the development trunk of
EDB Postgres for Kubernetes.

If you are currently in the `stable` channel, you need to either choose `fast` or
progressively move to the latest Long Term Supported release of EDB Postgres
for Kubernetes - currently `stable-v1.22`.

If you are in `stable` and your operator version is 1.15 or older, please move to
`stable-v1.15` and upgrade. Then repeat the operation with `stable-v1.16`, then
`stable-v1.17` to finally reach `stable-v1.18` or `fast`.

If you are in `stable` and your operator version is 1.16, please move to
`stable-v1.16` and upgrade. Then repeat the operation with `stable-v1.17` to
finally reach `stable-v1.18` or `fast`.

!!! Warning "1.15.x, 1.16.x, and 1.17.x are now End of Life"
    The last supported version of 1.15.x was released in October 2022.
    The last supported version of 1.16.x was released in December 2022.
    The last supported version of 1.17.x was released in March 2023.
    No future updates to these version are planned.
    Please refer to the [EDB "Platform Compatibility" page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility)
    for more details.

!!! Important
    We have made a change to the way conditions are represented in the status of
    the operator in version 1.16.0, 1.15.2, and onward. This change could cause
    an operator upgrade to hang on Openshift, if one of the old conditions are set
    during the upgrade process, because of the way the Operator Lifecycle Manager
    checks new CRDs against existing CRs.  To avoid this issue, you need to upgrade
    to version 1.15.5 first, which will automatically remove the offending
    conditions from all the cluster CRs that prevent Openshift from upgrading.

## Predefined RBAC objects

EDB Postgres for Kubernetes comes with a predefined set of resources that play an
important role when it comes to RBAC policy configuration.

### Custom Resource Definitions (CRD)

The EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator owns the following custom resource
definitions (CRD):

-   `Backup`
-   `Cluster`
-   `Pooler`
-   `ScheduledBackup`
-   `ImageCatalog`
-   `ClusterImageCatalog`

You can verify this by running:

```sh
oc get customresourcedefinitions.apiextensions.k8s.io | grep postgresql
```

which returns something similar to:

```console
backups.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io                            20YY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
clusterimagecatalogs.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io               20YY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
clusters.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io                           20YY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
imagecatalogs.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io                      20YY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
poolers.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io                            20YY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
scheduledbackups.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io                   20YY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ
```

### Service accounts

The namespace where the operator has been installed (by default
`openshift-operators`) contains the following predefined service accounts:
`builder`, `default`, `deployer`, and most importantly
`postgresql-operator-manager` (managed by the CSV).

!!! Important
    Service accounts in Kubernetes are namespaced resources. Unless explicitly
    authorized, a service account cannot be accessed outside the defined namespace.

You can verify this by running:

```sh
oc get serviceaccounts -n openshift-operators
```

which returns something similar to:

```console
NAME                          SECRETS   AGE
builder                       2         ...
default                       2         ...
deployer                      2         ...
postgresql-operator-manager   2         ...
```

The `default` service account is automatically created by Kubernetes and
present in every namespace. The `builder` and `deployer` service accounts are
automatically created by OpenShift (see ["Default project service accounts and roles"](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/authentication/using-service-accounts-in-applications.html#default-service-accounts-and-roles_using-service-accounts)).

The `postgresql-operator-manager` service account is the one used by the Cloud
Native PostgreSQL operator to work as part of the Kubernetes/OpenShift control
plane in managing PostgreSQL clusters.

!!! Important
    Do not delete the `postgresql-operator-manager` ServiceAccount as it can
    stop the operator from working.

### Cluster roles

The Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) automatically creates a set of cluster
role objects to facilitate role binding definitions and granular implementation
of RBAC policies. Some cluster roles have rules that apply to Custom Resource
Definitions that are part of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes, while others that are
part of the broader Kubernetes/OpenShift realm.

#### Cluster roles on EDB Postgres for Kubernetes CRDs

For [every CRD owned by EDB Postgres for Kubernetes' CSV](#custom-resource-definitions-crd),
OLM deploys some predefined cluster roles that can be used by customer facing
users and service accounts. In particular:

-   a role for the full administration of the resource (`admin` suffix)
-   a role to edit the resource (`edit` suffix)
-   a role to view the resource (`view` suffix)
-   a role to view the actual CRD (`crdview` suffix)

!!! Important
    Cluster roles per se are no security threat. They are the recommended way
    in OpenShift to define templates for roles to be later "bound" to actual users
    in a specific project or globally. Indeed, cluster roles can be used in
    conjunction with `ClusterRoleBinding` objects for global permissions or with
    `RoleBinding` objects for local permissions. This makes it possible to reuse
    cluster roles across multiple projects while enabling customization within
    individual projects through local roles.

You can verify the list of predefined cluster roles by running:

```sh
oc get clusterroles | grep postgresql
```

which returns something similar to:

```console

```

You can inspect an actual role as any other Kubernetes resource with the `get`
command. For example:

```sh
oc get -o yaml clusterrole clusters.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io-v1-admin
```

By looking at the relevant skimmed output below, you can notice that the
`clusters.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io-v1-admin` cluster role enables
everything on the `cluster` resource defined by the
`postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io` API group:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: clusters.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io-v1-admin
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io
  resources:
  - clusters
  verbs:
  - '*'
```

    If you are interested in the actual implementation of RBAC by an
    OperatorGroup, please refer to the
    ["OperatorGroup: RBAC" section from the Operator Lifecycle Manager documentation](https://olm.operatorframework.io/docs/concepts/crds/operatorgroup/#rbac).

#### Cluster roles on Kubernetes CRDs

When installing a `Subscription` object in a given namespace (e.g.
`openshift-operators` for cluster-wide installation of the operator), OLM also
creates a cluster role that is used to grant permissions to the
`postgresql-operator-manager` service account that the operator uses. The name
of this cluster role varies, as it depends on the installed version of the
operator and the time of installation.

You can retrieve it by running the following command:

```sh
oc get clusterrole --selector=olm.owner.kind=ClusterServiceVersion
```

You can then use the name returned by the above query (which should have the
form of `cloud-native-postgresql.VERSION-HASH`) to look at the rules, resources
and verbs via the `describe` command:

```sh
oc describe clusterrole cloud-native-postgresql.VERSION-HASH
```

```console
Name:         cloud-native-postgresql.VERSION.HASH
Labels:       olm.owner=cloud-native-postgresql.VERSION
              olm.owner.kind=ClusterServiceVersion

!!! Important
    The above permissions are exclusively reserved for the operator's service
    account to interact with the Kubernetes API server.  They are not directly
    accessible by the users of the operator that interact only with `Cluster`,
    `Pooler`, `Backup`, and `ScheduledBackup` resources (see
    ["Cluster roles on EDB Postgres for Kubernetes CRDs"](#cluster-roles-on-edb-postgres-for-kubernetes-crds)).

The operator automates in a declarative way a lot of operations related to
PostgreSQL management that otherwise would require manual and imperative
interventions. Such operations also include security related matters at RBAC
(e.g. service accounts), pod (e.g. security context constraints) and Postgres
levels (e.g. TLS certificates).

For more information about the reasons why the operator needs these elevated
permissions, please refer to the
["Security / Cluster / RBAC" section](security.md#role-based-access-control-rbac).

## Users and Permissions

A very common way to use the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator is to rely on the
`cluster-admin` role and manage resources centrally.

Alternatively, you can use the RBAC framework made available by
Kubernetes/OpenShift, as with any other operator or resources.

For example, you might be interested in binding the
`clusters.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io-v1-admin` cluster role to specific
groups or users in a specific namespace, as any other cloud native application.
The following example binds that cluster role to a specific user in the
`web-prod` project:

```yaml
kind: RoleBinding
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: web-prod-admin
  namespace: web-prod
subjects:
  - kind: User
    apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
    name: mario@cioni.org
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: clusters.postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io-v1-admin
```

The same process can be repeated with any other predefined `ClusterRole`.

If, on the other hand, you prefer not to use cluster roles, you can create
specific namespaced roles like in this example:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: web-prod-view
  namespace: web-prod
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io
  resources:
  - clusters
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
  - watch
```

Then, assign this role to a given user:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: web-prod-view
  namespace: web-prod
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: Role
  name: web-prod-view
subjects:
- apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: User
  name: web-prod-developer1
```

This final example creates a role with administration permissions (`verbs` is
equal to `*`) to all the resources managed by the operator in that namespace
(`web-prod`):

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: web-prod-admin
  namespace: web-prod
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io
  resources:
  - clusters
  - backups
  - scheduledbackups
  - poolers
  verbs:
  - '*'
```

## Pod Security Standards

EDB Postgres for Kubernetes on OpenShift supports the `restricted` and
`restricted-v2` SCC (`SecurityContextConstraints`), which vary depending on the
version of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes and OpenShift you are running.
Please pay close attention to the following table and notes:

| EDB Postgres for Kubernetes Version | OpenShift Versions | Supported SCC             |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| 1.24.x                              | 4.12-4.17          | restricted, restricted-v2 |
| 1.23.x                              | 4.12-4.16          | restricted, restricted-v2 |
| 1.22.x                              | 4.12-4.16          | restricted, restricted-v2 |
| 1.18.x                              | 4.10-4.13          | restricted, restricted-v2 |

!!! Important
    Since version 4.10 only provides `restricted`, EDB Postgres for Kubernetes
    versions 1.18 and 1.19 support `restricted`. Future releases of EDB Postgres
    for Kubernetes are not guaranteed to support `restricted`, since in Openshift
    4.11 `restricted` was replaced with `restricted-v2`.

!!! Important "Security changes in OpenShift >=4.11"
    With Kubernetes 1.21 the `PodSecurityPolicy` has been replaced by the Pod
    Security Admission Controller to become the new default way to manage the
    security inside Kubernetes. On Openshift 4.11, which is running Kubernetes
    1.21, there is also included a new set of SecurityContextConstraints (SCC) that
    will be the default SCCs to manage workloads; these new SCC are
    `restricted-v2`, `nonroot-v2` and `hostnetwork-v2`. For more information,
    please read ["Important OpenShift changes to Pod Security Standards"](https://connect.redhat.com/en/blog/important-openshift-changes-pod-security-standards).

Since the operator has been developed with a security focus from the beginning,
in addition to always adhering to the Red Hat Certification process, EDB
Postgres for Kubernetes works under the new SCCs introduced in OpenShift 4.11.

By default, EDB Postgres for Kubernetes will drop all capabilities. This
ensures that during its lifecycle the operator will never make use of any
unsafe capabilities.

On OpenShift we inherit the `SecurityContext.SeccompProfile` for each Pod from
the OpenShift deployment, which in turn is set by the Pod Security Admission
Controller.

!!! Note
    Even if `nonroot-v2` and `hostnetwork-v2` are qualified as less restricted
    SCCs, we don't run tests on them, and therefore we cannot guarantee that these
    SCCs will work. That being said, `nonroot-v2` and `hostnetwork-v2` are a subset
    of rules in `restricted-v2` so there is no reason to believe that they would
    not work. 

## Customization of the Pooler image

By default, the `Pooler` resource creates pods having the `pgbouncer` container
that runs with the `quay.io/enterprisedb/pgbouncer` image.

!!! Note "There's more"
    For more details about pod customization for the pooler, please refer to
    the ["Pod templates"](connection_pooling.md#pod-templates) section in the
    connection pooling documentation.

You can change the image name from the advanced interface, specifically by
opening the *"Template"* section, then selecting *"Add container"*
under *"Spec > Containers"*:

![Pooler template](./images/pgbouncer-pooler-template.png)

Then:

-   set `pgbouncer` as the name of the container (required field in the pod template)
-   set the *"Image"* field as desired (see the image below)

![Pooler image](./images/pgbouncer-pooler-image.png)

## OADP for Velero

The EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator recommends the use of the
[Openshift API for Data Protection](https://github.com/openshift/oadp-operator) operator for managing [Velero](https://velero.io/)
in OpenShift environments.
Specific details about how EDB Postgres for Kubernetes integrates with Velero
can be found in the [Velero section](addons.md#velero) of the Addons documentation.
The [OADP operator](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/backup_and_restore/application_backup_and_restore/installing/about-installing-oadp.html)
is a community operator that is not directly supported by EDB.
The OADP operator is not required to use Velero with EDB Postgres but is a
convenient way to install Velero on OpenShift.

## Monitoring and metrics

OpenShift includes a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io) installation out of
the box that can be leveraged for user-defined projects, including EDB
Postgres for Kubernetes.

Grafana integration is out of scope for this guide, as Grafana is no longer
included with OpenShift.

In this section, we show you how to get started with basic observability,
leveraging the default OpenShift installation.

Please refer to the [OpenShift monitoring stack overview](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/observability/monitoring/monitoring-overview.html)
for further background.

Depending on your OpenShift configuration, you may need to do a bit of setup
before you can monitor your EDB Postgres for Kubernetes clusters.

You will need to have your OpenShift configured to
[enable monitoring for user-defined projects](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/observability/monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects.html).

You should check, perhaps with your OpenShift administrator, if your
installation has the `cluster-monitoring-config` configMap, and if so,
if user workload monitoring is enabled.

You can check for the presence of this `configMap` (note that it should be in the
`openshift-monitoring` namespace):

```sh
oc -n openshift-monitoring get configmap cluster-monitoring-config
```

To enable user workload monitoring, you might want to `oc apply` or `oc edit`
the configmap to look something like this:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cluster-monitoring-config
  namespace: openshift-monitoring
data:
  config.yaml: |
    enableUserWorkload: true 
```

After `enableUserWorkload` is set, several monitoring components will be
created in the `openshift-user-workload-monitoring` namespace.

```sh
$ oc -n openshift-user-workload-monitoring get pod
NAME                                  READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
prometheus-operator-58768d7cc-28xb5   2/2     Running   0          5h10m
prometheus-user-workload-0            6/6     Running   0          5h10m
prometheus-user-workload-1            6/6     Running   0          5h10m
thanos-ruler-user-workload-0          3/3     Running   0          5h10m
thanos-ruler-user-workload-1          3/3     Running   0          5h10m
```

You should now be able to see metrics from any cluster enabling them.

For example, we can create the following cluster with monitoring on the `foo`
namespace:

```sh
kubectl apply -n foo -f - <<EOF
---
apiVersion: postgresql.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1
kind: Cluster
metadata:
  name: cluster-with-metrics
spec:
  instances: 3

  storage:
    size: 1Gi

  monitoring:
    enablePodMonitor: true
EOF
```

You should now be able to query for the default metrics that will be installed
with this example.
In the `Observe` section of OpenShift (in Developer perspective), you should see
a `Metrics` submenu where you can write PromQL queries. Auto-complete is
enabled, so you can peek the `cnp_` prefix:

![Prometheus queries](./images/openshift/prometheus-queries.png)

It is easy to define Alerts based on the default metrics as `PrometheusRules`.
You can find some examples of rules in the [prometheusrule.yaml](../samples/monitoring/prometheusrule.yaml)
file, which you can download.

Before applying the rules, again, some OpenShift setup may be necessary.

The `monitoring-rules-edit` or at least `monitoring-rules-view` roles should
be assigned for the user wishing to apply and monitor the rules.

This involves creating a RoleBinding with that permission, for a namespace.
Again, refer to the [relevant OpenShift document page](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.16/observability/monitoring/enabling-monitoring-for-user-defined-projects.html)
for further detail.
Specifically, the *Granting user permissions by using the web console* section
should be of interest.

Note that the RoleBinding for `monitoring-rules-edit` applies to a namespace, so
make sure you get the right one/ones.

Suppose that the `cnp-prometheusrule.yaml` file that you have previouly downloaded
now contains your alerts. You can install those rules as follows:

```sh
oc apply -n foo -f cnp-prometheusrule.yaml
```

Now you should be able to see Alerts, if there are any. Note that initially
there might be no alerts.

Alert routing and notifications are beyond the scope of this guide.
