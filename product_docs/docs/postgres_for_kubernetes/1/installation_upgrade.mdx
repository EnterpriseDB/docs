    For instructions on how to install EDB Postgres for Kubernetes on Red Hat
    OpenShift Container Platform, see [Red Hat OpenShift](openshift.md).


The following supplements the [Installation and upgrades](https://cloudnative-pg.io/docs/1.15.0/installation_upgrade/) topic in the upstream CloudNativePG project.

## Installation on Kubernetes

### Directly using the operator manifest

The operator can be installed like any other resource in Kubernetes,
through a YAML manifest applied via `kubectl`.

You can install the [latest operator manifest](https://get.enterprisedb.io/cnp/postgresql-operator-1.15.0.yaml)
as follows:

```sh
kubectl apply -f \
  https://get.enterprisedb.io/cnp/postgresql-operator-1.15.0.yaml
```

Once you have run the `kubectl` command, EDB Postgres for Kubernetes will be installed in your Kubernetes cluster.

You can verify that with:

```sh
kubectl get deploy -n postgresql-operator-system postgresql-operator-controller-manager
```

<!-- THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE
### Using the Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)

OperatorHub is a community-sourced index of operators available via the
[Operator Lifecycle Manager](https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager),
which is a package managing system for operators.

You can install EDB Postgres for Kubernetes using the metadata available in the
[EDB Postgres for Kubernetes page](https://operatorhub.io/operator/cloud-native-postgresql)
from the [OperatorHub.io website](https://operatorhub.io), following the installation steps listed on that page.

## Details about the deployment

Differently from CloudNativePG, the operator is installed in the `postgresql-operator-system` namespace as a Kubernetes
`Deployment` called `postgresql-operator-controller-manager` by default. You can get more information by running:

```sh
kubectl describe deploy \
  -n postgresql-operator-system \
  postgresql-operator-controller-manager
```
