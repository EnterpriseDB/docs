navTitle: "Version 1.18.7"

Released: 18 Oct 2023

EDB Postgres for Kubernetes version 1.8.7 is an LTS release of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes; there is no corresponding upstream release of CloudNativePG.

## Highlights of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes 1.8.7

- Changed the default value of `stopDelay` to 1800 seconds instead of 30 seconds
- Introduced a new parameter, called `smartShutdownTimeout`, to control the
  window of time reserved for the smart shutdown of Postgres to complete; the
  general formula to compute the overall timeout to stop Postgres is
  `max(stopDelay -  smartShutdownTimeout, 30)` 
- Changed the default value of `startDelay` to 3600, instead of 30 seconds
- Replaced the livenessProbe initial delay with a more proper Kubernetes
  startup probe to deal with the start of a Postgres server
- Changed the default value of `switchoverDelay` to 3600 seconds instead of
  40000000 seconds 

Additionally, this release of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes includes the following:

|     Type     |                                                          Description                                                           |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Security fix | Added a default `seccompProfile` to the operator deployment.                                              |                                                                                                                              |
| Enhancement  | Introduced the `k8s.enterprisedb.io/coredumpFilter` annotation to control the content of a core dump generated in the unlikely event of a PostgreSQL crash, by default set to exclude shared memory segments from the dump.                          |
| Enhancement  | Allowed configuration of ephemeral-storage limits for the shared memory and temporary data ephemeral volumes.                                                                                 |
| Enhancement  | Validation of resource limits and requests through the webhook.      |
| Enhancement  | Ensure that PostgreSQL's `shared_buffers` are coherent with the pods' allocated memory resources.   |
| Enhancement  | Added `uri` and `jdbc-uri` fields in the credential secrets to facilitate developers when connecting their applications to the database.  |
| Enhancement  | Added a new phase, `Waiting for the instances to become active`, for finer control of a cluster's state waiting for the replicas to be ready.  |
| Enhancement  | Improved detection of Pod rollout conditions through the `podSpec` annotation.  |
| Enhancement  | Added primary timestamp and uptime to the kubectl plugin's `status` command.  |
| Technical enhancement  | Replaced `k8s-api-docgen` with `gen-crd-api-reference-docs` to automatically build the API reference documentation. |
| Bug fix      | Ensure that the primary instance is always recreated first by prioritizing ready PVCs with a primary role.                                                     |
| Bug fix      | Honor the `k8s.enterprisedb.io/skipEmptyWalArchiveCheck` annotation during recovery to bypass the check for an empty WAL archive.  |
| Bug fix      | prevent a cluster from being stuck when the PostgreSQL server is down but the pod is up on the primary.                                   |
| Bug fix      | Avoid treating the designated primary in a replica cluster as a regular HA replica when replication slots are enabled.  |
| Bug fix | Reconcile services every time the selectors change or when labels/annotations need to be changed.                                                                |
| Bug fix | Default to `app` for both the owner and database during recovery bootstrap. |
| Bug fix | Avoid write-read concurrency on cached cluster. |
| Bug fix | Remove empty items, make them unique and sort in the `ResourceName` sections of the generated roles. |
| Bug fix | Ensure that the `ContinuousArchiving` condition is properly set to 'failed' in case of errors. |
| Bug fix | Reconcile PodMonitor `labels` and `annotations`. |
| Bug fix | Fixed backup failure due to missing RBAC `resourceNames` on the `Role` object. |
| Observability | Added TCP port label to default `pg_stat_replication` metric. |
| Observability | Fixed the `pg_wal_stat` default metric for Prometheus. |
| Observability | Improved the `pg_replication` default metric for Prometheus |
| Observability | Used `alertInstanceLabelFilter` instead of `alertName` in the provided Grafana dashboard |
| Observability | Enforce `standard_conforming_strings` in metric collection. | 
| Change | Set the default operand image to PostgreSQL 16.0. |
| Change | Fencing now uses PostgreSQL's fast shutdown instead of smart shutdown to halt an instance. | 
| Change | Rename webhooks from kb.io to k8s.enterprisedb.io group. |
| Change | Added the `k8s.enterprisedb.io/instanceRole` label and deprecated the existing `role` label. |
