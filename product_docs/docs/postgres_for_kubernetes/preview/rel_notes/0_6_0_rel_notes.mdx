| Type    | Description                                                                                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Feature | Add Point-In-Time Recovery based on timestamp, target name, or transaction Id, as well as the specification of the timeline, through a new bootstrap method option called `recoveryTarget`. |
| Feature | Add Synchronous Streaming Replication support through the `minSyncReplicas` and `maxSyncReplicas` cluster options, defining respectively the expected minimum and maximum number of synchronous standby servers at any time (disabled by default)                                  |
| Feature | Support EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).                                                                 |
| Feature | Configure `initdb` options for the bootstrap of an empty cluster (`initDb`).                                 |
| Feature | Enable/Disable Redwood compatibility level with EPAS.                                                        |
| Feature | Extend the instance manager with a new framework for the export of metrics for Prometheus - currently supporting pg_stat_archiver only.                                                  |
| Feature | Use Kubernetes jobs instead of init containers to perform cluster initialization procedures (including standby creation and recovery) and improve their observability.                                                  |
| Feature | Record Kubernetes events to be used by `kubectl describe` and `kubectl get events`.                          |
| Feature | Introduce Kubernetes expectations for Pods, PVCs, and Jobs to prevent race conditions.                       |
| Feature | Set `application_name` in PostgreSQL to the name of the Pod/instance.                                        |
| Feature | The `fullRecovery` bootstrap mode has been renamed to `recovery` to address also Point-In-Time Recovery      |
| Fix     | Bug fixes and code improvements.                                                                             |
