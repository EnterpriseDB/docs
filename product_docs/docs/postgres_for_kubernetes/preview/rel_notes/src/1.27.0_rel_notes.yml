product: EDB CloudNativePG Cluster
version: 1.27.0-rc1
date: 29 July 2025
intro: |
 This is a preview (Release Candidate 1) of the next release of EDB CloudNativePG Cluster (v1.27.0).
 
 ### Important changes

 A change in the default behavior of the [liveness probe](instance_manager.md#liveness-probe),
    now enforcing the [shutdown of an isolated primary](instance_manager.md#primary-isolation)
    within the `livenessProbeTimeout` (30 seconds), will require a restart of your pods.
    
 This release includes the following:
components:
  "Operator": 1.27.0-rc1
  "CNP plugin": 1.27.0-rc1
  upstream-merge: Upstream [1.27.0-rc1](https://cloudnative-pg.io/documentation/preview/release_notes/v1.27/)
relnotes:
- relnote: |
    Dynamic loading of PostgreSQL extensions, packaged as OCI-compliant container images, is now supported.
  details: |
    The `.spec.postgresql.extensions` stanza allows you to mount PostgreSQL extensions as read-only and immutable volumes inside instance pods.
    This enables dynamic extension management without rebuilding base images.

- relnote: Logical decoding slot synchronizatio in HA clusters
  details: |
    Added the `synchronizeLogicalDecoding` field under `spec.replicationSlots.highAvailability` to enable automatic synchronization of logical decoding slots across high-availability clusters.
    This ensures that logical replication subscribers continue seamlessly after a publisher failover.

- relnote: Primary Isolation Check
  details: |
    Promoted to stable the liveness pinger experimental feature introduced in 1.26,
    adding the `.spec.probes.liveness.isolationCheck` section to enable primary isolation checks
    in the liveness probe by default.
    This improves the detection and handling of primary connectivity issues in Kubernetes environments.
