Released: 18 Oct 2024

EDB Postgres for Kubernetes version 1.22.7 is an LTS release of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes; there is no corresponding upstream release of CloudNativePG.

This release of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes includes the following:

### Enhancements:

  - Remove the use of `pg_database_size` from the status probe, as it caused high resource utilization by scanning the entire `PGDATA` directory to compute database sizes. The `kubectl status` plugin will now rely on `du` to provide detailed size information retrieval (\#5689).
  - Add the ability to configure the `full_page_writes` parameter in PostgreSQL. This setting defaults to `on`, in line with PostgreSQL's recommendations (\#5516).
  - Plugin:
      - Add the `logs pretty` command in the `cnp` plugin to read a log stream from standard input and output a human-readable format, with options to filter log entries (\#5770)
      - Enhance the `status` command by allowing multiple `-v` options to increase verbosity for more detailed output (\#5765).
      - Add support for specifying a custom Docker image using the `--image` flag in the `pgadmin4` plugin command, giving users control over the Docker image used for pgAdmin4 deployments (\#5515).

### Fixes:

  - Ensure that replica PodDisruptionBudgets (PDB) are removed when scaling down to two instances, enabling easier maintenance on the node hosting the replica (\#5487).
  - Prioritize full rollout over inplace restarts (\#5407).
  - Fix an issue that could lead to double failover in cases of lost connectivity (\#5788).
  - Correctly set the `TMPDIR` and `PSQL_HISTORY` environment variables for pods and jobs, improving temporary file and history management (\#5503).
  - Plugin:
      - Resolve a race condition in the `logs cluster` command (\#5775).
      - Display the `potential` sync status in the `status` plugin (\#5533).
      - Fix the issue where pods deployed by the `pgadmin4` command didnâ€™t have a writable home directory (\#5800).

### Supported versions

  - PostgreSQL 17 (PostgreSQL 17.0 is the default image)
