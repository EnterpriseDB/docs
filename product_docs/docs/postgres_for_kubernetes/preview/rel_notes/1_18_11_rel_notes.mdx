Released: 22 Mar 2024

EDB Postgres for Kubernetes version 1.18.11 is an LTS release of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes; there is no corresponding upstream release of CloudNativePG.

This release of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes includes the following:

| Type         | Description |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Enhancement  | Allow customization of the wal_level GUC in PostgreSQL ([#4020](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/4020)). |
| Enhancement  | Added the `cnpg.io/skipWalArchiving` annotation to disable WAL archiving when set to `enabled` ([#4055](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/4055)). |
| Enhancement  | Enriched the `cnpg` plugin for `kubectl` with the `publication` and `subscription` command groups to imperatively set up PostgreSQL native logical replication ([#4052](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/4052)). |
| Enhancement  | Allow customization of `CERTIFICATE_DURATION` and `EXPIRING_CHECK_THRESHOLD` for automated management of TLS certificates handled by the operator ([#3686](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/3686)). |
| Enhancement  | Now retrieves the correct architecture's binary from the corresponding catalog in the running operator image during in-place updates, enabling the operator to inject the correct binary into any Pod with a supported architecture ([#3840](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/3840)).
| Security     | Now uses `Role` instead of `ClusterRole` for operator permissions in OLM, requiring fewer privileges when installed on a per-namespace basis ([#3855](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/3855), [#3990](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/3990)). |
| Security     | Now enforces fully-qualified object names in SQL queries for the PgBouncer pooler ([#4080](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/4080)). |
| Bug fix      | Now properly synchronizes PVC group labels with those on the pods, a critical aspect when all pods are deleted and the operator needs to decide which Pod to recreate first ([#3930](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/3930)). |
| Bug fix      | Now disables `wal_sender_timeout` when cloning a replica to prevent timeout errors due to slow connections ([#4080](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/4080)). |
| Bug fix      | Now ensures that backups are ready before initiating recovery bootstrap procedures, preventing an error condition where recovery with incomplete backups could enter an error loop ([#3663](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/3663)). |
| Bug fix      | Resolve a corner case in hibernation where the instance pod has been deleted, but the cluster status still has the hibernation condition set to false ([#3970](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/3970)). |
| Bug fix      | Correctly detect Google Cloud capabilities for Barman Cloud ([#3931](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/3931)). |
| Update       | Set the default operand image to PostgreSQL 16.2 ([#3823](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/3823)). |
