| Security     |                   | By default, TLSv1.3 is now enforced on all PostgreSQL 12 or higher installations. Additionally, users can configure the `ssl_ciphers`, `ssl_min_protocol_version`, and `ssl_max_protocol_version` GUCs ([#3408](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/3408)). |
| Security     |                   | Integrated Docker image scanning with Dockle to enhance security measures. |
| Defaults     |                   | Default operand image is now PostgreSQL 16.1 ([#3270](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/3270)). |

| Enhancement  | Connection pooler | Added the `k8s.enterprisedb.io/podRole` label with a value of 'pooler' to every pooler deployment, differentiating them from instance pods ([#3396](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/3396)). |

| Bug fix      |                   | Secrets labeled `cnpg.io/reload=true` and used by external clusters are now reloaded when they change ([#3565](https://github.com/cloudnative-pg/cloudnative-pg/pull/3565)).  |
