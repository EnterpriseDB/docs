{{name.ln}} candidate releases are pre-release versions made available for
testing before the community issues a new generally available (GA) release.
These versions are feature-frozen, meaning no new features are added, and are
intended for public testing prior to the final release.

!!! Important
    {{name.ln}} release candidates are not intended for use in production
    systems.

## Purpose of Release Candidates

Release candidates are provided to the community for extensive testing before
the official release. While a release candidate aims to be identical to the
initial release of a new minor version of {{name.ln}}, additional changes may
be implemented before the GA release.

## Community Involvement

The stability of each {{name.ln}} minor release significantly depends on the
community's efforts to test the upcoming version with their workloads and
tools. Identifying bugs and regressions through user testing is crucial in
determining when we can finalize the release.

## Usage Advisory

The {{name.ln}} Community strongly advises against using preview versions of
{{name.ln}} in production environments or active development projects. Although
{{name.ln}} undergoes extensive automated and manual testing, beta releases
may contain serious bugs. Features in preview versions may change in ways that
are not backwards compatible and could be removed entirely.

## Current Preview Version

The current preview version is **1.28.0-rc1**.
