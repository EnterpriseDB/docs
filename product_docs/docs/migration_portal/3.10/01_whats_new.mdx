The following enhancements are added to the Migration Portal for this release:

-   Assessment for EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 13, which has additional Oracle compatibility improvements and new Postgres features.

-   In addition to IBM Cloud, you can now migrate your Oracle schemas to EDB Postgres Advanced Server installed on the following cloud platforms:

    > -   Amazon AWS
    > -   Google cloud
    > -   Microsoft Azure

-   We added a contact form so you can reach out to us about migration services if you need an offline assessment of your schemas.

-   With this release, the DDL extractor script requires fewer privileges. It now only requires `CONNECT` and `SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE` role and `CREATE TABLE` privilege.

**Repair Handler**

The following repair handlers convert Oracle syntax to Postgres-compatible syntax so that you donâ€™t have to do it manually.

-   ERH 1013 - PACKAGE\_BODY\_PROC/FUNC\_DECLARATION

    Removes PROCEDURE/FUNCTION declaration from the PACKAGE BODY definition.

    For example,

    ``` text
    CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY package_name
    IS
         PROCEDURE sample_proc;

         var1 number:=0;

         FUNCTION Func_name RETURN number;

         PROCEDURE proc_name
         IS
         BEGIN
             NULL;
         END;

         PROCEDURE sample_proc
         IS
         BEGIN
             NULL;
         END;

         FUNCTION Func_name RETURN number
         IS
         BEGIN
             return 1;
         END;
     END;
    ```

    would become;

>           return 1;
>       END;
> END``

-   ERH 2091- CREATE\_TABLE\_CREATE\_INDEX

    Removes schema-name from the name of the INDEX in CREATE INDEX definition.

    For example,

    ``` text
    CREATE TABLE "HR"."DEPARTMENTS"
       (   "DEPARTMENT_ID" NUMBER(4,0),
        "DEPARTMENT_NAME" VARCHAR2(30) CONSTRAINT "DEPT_NAME_NN" NOT NULL ENABLE,
        "MANAGER_ID" NUMBER(6,0),
        "LOCATION_ID" NUMBER(4,0)
       ) ;
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "HR"."DEPT_ID_PK" ON "HR"."DEPARTMENTS" ("DEPARTMENT_ID");
    ```

    would become;

    ``` text
    CREATE TABLE "HR"."DEPARTMENTS"
       ( "DEPARTMENT_ID" NUMBER(4,0),
      "DEPARTMENT_NAME" VARCHAR2(30) CONSTRAINT "DEPT_NAME_NN" NOT NULL ENABLE,
      "MANAGER_ID" NUMBER(6,0),
      "LOCATION_ID" NUMBER(4,0)
       ) ;
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "DEPT_ID_PK" ON "HR"."DEPARTMENTS" ("DEPARTMENT_ID");
    ```

-   ERH 2092- ALTER\_TABLE\_ADD\_PRIMARY\_KEY

    Transforms Oracle's ALTER TABLE ADD CONSTRAINT for PRIMARY KEY syntax to Advanced Server compatible syntax.

    For example,

    ``` text
    CREATE TABLE "HR"."DEPARTMENTS"
       (   "DEPARTMENT_ID" NUMBER(4,0),
        "DEPARTMENT_NAME" VARCHAR2(30) CONSTRAINT "DEPT_NAME_NN" NOT NULL ENABLE,
        "MANAGER_ID" NUMBER(6,0),
        "LOCATION_ID" NUMBER(4,0)
       ) ;
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "HR"."DEPT_ID_PK" ON "HR"."DEPARTMENTS" ("DEPARTMENT_ID");
    ALTER TABLE "HR"."DEPARTMENTS" ADD CONSTRAINT "DEPT_ID_PK" PRIMARY KEY ("DEPARTMENT_ID")
      USING INDEX "HR"."DEPT_ID_PK"  ENABLE;
    ```

    would become;

    ``` text
    CREATE TABLE "HR"."DEPARTMENTS"
       (   "DEPARTMENT_ID" NUMBER(4,0),
        "DEPARTMENT_NAME" VARCHAR2(30) CONSTRAINT "DEPT_NAME_NN" NOT NULL ENABLE,
        "MANAGER_ID" NUMBER(6,0),
        "LOCATION_ID" NUMBER(4,0)
       ) ;
    CREATE UNIQUE INDEX "DEPT_ID_PK" ON "HR"."DEPARTMENTS" ("DEPARTMENT_ID");
    ALTER TABLE "HR"."DEPARTMENTS" ADD PRIMARY KEY
      USING INDEX "DEPT_ID_PK";
    ```
