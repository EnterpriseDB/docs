# The 3.4.0 folder includes the 3.0.1, 3.1.0, 3.2.0, 3.3.0 and 3.4.0 changes. We removed the earlier release folders because we only want to display a Version label for Migration Portal documentation reflecting the latest release on Docs 2.0. When preparing for a future release, create your working branch, rename the 3.4.0 folder to the latest version number, and add a redirect for the previous version the Migration Portal section in the file /static/_redirects. To get back to the previous sources use a tag dated between June 23rd and June 27th, 2021.

Migration Portal is a web-based service for migrating Oracle database schemas to the EDB Postgres platform. The Migration Portal assesses and analyzes Oracle database schemas and converts types, tables, sequences, constraints, triggers, views, stored procedures, packages, database links (dblinks), materialized views, and indexes, producing DDLs compatible with EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

The user-friendly portal interface simplifies the assessment and migration process. Log in to the portal and start with the migration process.

The Migration Portal guide provides a high-level description of the steps involved in the migration process. The guide also includes solutions to common migration problems and details of unsupported features and their potential workarounds.

EnterpriseDB has helped companies migrate their existing database systems to Postgres for years. For more information, visit the EnterpriseDB website at: <https://www.enterprisedb.com/>
