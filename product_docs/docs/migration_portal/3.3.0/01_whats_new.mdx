The following is added to the Migration Portal for the release 3.3.0:

- Improved Assessment progress bar along with DDL file upload progress information

- Enhanced Knowledge Base and Repair Handlers documentation

- Optimized user experience in project loading, workspace, and report generation. 

- Detects and reports incompatibility for Oracleâ€™s unsupported catalog tables (ex: v$parameter, v$instance, etc.) inside PL/SQL block.

- Added informative text in the exported DDL file to better distinguish the start of object DDLs

    - ERH-2013 EDITIONABLE - The Repair Handler is enhanced to repair the EDITIONABLE keyword in appropriate contexts only
