-   Many changes are made to the new UI for better user experience.
-   Report generating duration for larger projects is optimized drastically. For example, previously, the time required to generate a report was 5 to 7 minutes. However, now it takes less than 5 seconds to generate a report.

**New Repair Handler**

The following repair handler is added to improve the Advance Server compatibility ratio:

-   ERH 2090 - Convert Function:

    Replaces Oracle's `CONVERT` function with EDB Postgres Advanced Server compatible `convert` or `convert_to` function inside any PL/SQL block.

    For example:

>     CREATE VIEW MY_VIEW1 AS SELECT CONVERT('Ä Ê Í Õ Ø A B C D E','AL32UTF8','
>     WE8ISO8859P1') as CONVERT_TEST FROM dual;
>     CREATE VIEW MY_VIEW2 AS SELECT CONVERT('Ä Ê Í Õ Ø A B C D E','AL32UTF8') as
>     CONVERT_TEST FROM dual;
>
> would become;
>
>     CREATE VIEW MY_VIEW1 AS SELECT convert('Ä Ê Í Õ Ø A B C D E','LATIN1','UTF8')
>     as CONVERT_TEST FROM dual;
>     CREATE VIEW MY_VIEW2 AS SELECT convert_to('Ä Ê Í Õ Ø A B C D E','UTF8')
>     as CONVERT_TEST FROM dual;
