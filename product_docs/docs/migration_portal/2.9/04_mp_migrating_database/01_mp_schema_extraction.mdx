**Prerequisites**

Before extracting a schema, you must download the latest EDB DDL Extractor script from the Migration Portal `Projects` page or from the link provided in the DDL Extractor guide in the Portal Wiki. The script can be run in SQL Developer or SQL\*Plus. It uses Oracle’s `DBMS_METADATA` built-in package to extract DDLs for different objects under schemas (specified while running the script). The EDB DDL extractor creates the DDL file that will be uploaded to the portal and analyzed for EDB Postgres compatibility.

The *script user* must have `CONNECT`, `RESOURCE` and `SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE` roles.

</div>

**For SQL\*Plus**

1.  Connect to SQL\*Plus and run the command:

    `SQL>@edb_ddl_extractor.sql`

2.  Provide the schema name and the path or directory in which the extractor will store the extracted DDL. When extracting multiple schemas, use a comma (‘,’) as a delimiter.

If you want to extract all the user schemas from the current database, do not mention any schema names while extracting. However, it is recommended to mention the schema names that you would like to extract.

</div>

1.  If you want to extract dependent objects from other schemas, enter `yes` or `no`.

    **For example, on Linux:**

    `Enter a comma separated list of schemas to be extracted (Default all schemas): HR, SCOTT, FINANCE` `Location for output file (Default current location) : /home/oracle/extracted_ddls/`

    `WARNING:`

    `Given schema(s) list may contain objects which are dependent on objects from other schema(s), not mentioned in the list.` `Assessment may fail for such objects. It is suggested to extract all dependent objects together.`

    `Extract dependent object from other schemas?(yes/no) (Default no / Ignored for all schemas option): yes`

    **On Windows:**

    `Enter comma separated list of schemas to be extracted (Default all schemas): HR, SCOTT, FINANCE` `Location for output file (Default current location) : c:\Users\Example\Desktop\`

    `WARNING:`

    `Given schema(s) list may contain objects which are dependent on objects from other schema(s), not mentioned in the list.` `Assessment may fail for such objects. It is suggested to extract all dependent objects together.`

**For SQL Developer**

1.  Connect to the SQL server and run the following command:

![*Enter the path for Linux or Windows.*](../images/mp_schema_extraction_paths.png)

1.  Enter a comma-separated list of schemas:

![*Provide a list of schemas.*](../images/mp_schema_extraction_list.png)

1.  Enter the file path for the output file:

![*Specify the output file path.*](../images/mp_schema_extraction_target.png)

1.  Enter (yes/no) to extract dependant objects:

![*Extracting dependent objects.*](../images/mp_schema_dependent_objects.png)

**Note**: You can also enter single schema name in both SQL\*Plus and SQL Developer.

The script then iterates through the object types in the source database and once the task is completed, the .SQL output is stored at the entered location, i.e., `c:\Users\Example\Desktop\`.

**Additional Notes**

-   The EDB DDL Extractor script does not extract objects that were restored using `Flashback` and still have names like `BIN$b54+4XlEYwPgUAB/AQBWwA==$0`. If you want to extract these objects, you must change the name of the objects and re-run the extraction process.
-   DDL Extractor extracts `nologging` tables as normal tables. Once these tables are migrated to EDB Postgres Advanced Server, WAL log files will be created.

## Oracle System Schemas
