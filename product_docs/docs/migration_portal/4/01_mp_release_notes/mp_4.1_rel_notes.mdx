New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Migration Portal 4.1 include the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Enhancement | The Migration Portal now provides the capability to calculate a migration complexity score based on the effort type and complexity level relevant to Oracle constructs (for example, features) found in the uploaded DDL. |
| Enhancement | The user can now apply filtering to the available schemas and underlying objects in a project to generate target database DDL for a subset of selected object types. Additionally, instead of a single DDL SQL file being created for download, a zip archive is created, which contains separate files for each selected object type, as well as consolidated scripts for the project and the selected schemas. |
| Enhancement | Added a new repair handler ERH-3005 to transform Q quoted strings to either dollar quoted or E quoted strings. |
| Enhancement | Enhanced the ERH-2078 repair handler to apply pipelined specific transformations at the package header level. |
| Enhancement | Updated the ERH-2034 repair handler so that it removes NULL from the TYPE definition provided inside a PACKAGE. |
| Security fix | Upgraded the async, eventsource, h2, jsdom, and moment libraries to the latest versions to address security issues ([CVE-2021-43138](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-43138), [CVE-2022-1650](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-1650), [CVE-2022-23221](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-23221), [CVE-2021-42392](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42392), [CVE-2021-20066](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20066), and [CVE-2022-31129](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31129)). |
| Bug fix | Fixed a corner case that resulted in the skipping of some indexes when processing source Oracle DDL files generated using the Oracle Data Pump utilities. |
| Bug fix | Fixed the behavior where only the ENABLE keyword was being removed from the ENABLE NOVALIDATE clause in ALTER TABLE statements so that the complete clause is now removed. Also, updated the relevant repair handlers ERH-2003 and ERH-2005. |
| Bug fix | Fixed a synchronization thread issue that was impacting the performance of other assessments running in parallel with a long-running schema assessment. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue where the DEDUPLICATE LOB clause in CREATE TABLE statements that are generated by the Oracle Data Pump utilities resulted in DDL parsing related errors. |
