| Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhancement  | Added support for the EDB Postgres Advanced Server `SPL_CHECK`  extension. All the `Procedures`, `Functions`, `Package Body`, `Type Body` and `Trigger` definitions are now also automatically assessed using the `SPL_CHECK` extension to detect potential run time errors. |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed a bug in the `edb_ddl_extractor.sql` script which caused an error message related to the `ORACLE_MAINTAINED` flag for Oracle 11g source databases.                                                                                                                     |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed a bug which incorrectly identified `htp.p` package subprogram calls as being incompatible for target database versions 15, 16 and 17.                                                                                                                                  |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue that caused project assessments to fail when a large number of errors were detected by the DDL parsing process.                                                                                                                                               |
