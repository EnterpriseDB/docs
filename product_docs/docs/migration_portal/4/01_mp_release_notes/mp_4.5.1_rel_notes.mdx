## End-of-support notice

Since the end of standard support for EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 11 is scheduled for November 20, 2023, select more recent versions of EDB Postgres Advanced Server that are supported beyond 2023 for new Migration Portal projects. Support for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11 is planned to begin being removed from Migration Portal on May 20, 2023 to help ensure that no new EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11 projects are created after this date. 

To maximize the length of available support and to take advantage of new features, particularly those that provide added compatibility with Oracle, we recommend selecting the latest EDB Postgres Advanced Server version as the target of a Migration Portal project. See the EDB [Platform Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#epas) page for more information on the support periods for each EDB Postgres Advanced Server major version.
