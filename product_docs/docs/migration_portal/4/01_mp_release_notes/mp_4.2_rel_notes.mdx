New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Migration Portal 4.2 include the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Enhancement | Added support for calculating a schema migration complexity score and generating a feature analysis for existing projects that were created prior to the 4.1.0 release. |
| Enhancement | Enhanced the schema migration complexity scoring capability to accommodate updating the score after manually repairing objects. |
| Enhancement | Added a new “Unresolved Objects” table in the Feature Analysis section of the schema assessment report that lists objects with unresolved errors and the list of incompatible Oracle features used in those objects. |
| Enhancement | Improved the performance of the schema assessment report generation by up to 3x for projects that contain a large number of Oracle features. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the Migration Portal to capture and more accurately report the use of incompatible built-in package and SYS schema TYPE objects. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the Migration Portal to more accurately capture the presence of the  following Oracle features and assess their impact on schema migration complexity: USER DEFINED EXCEPTION RISING, USER DEFINED EXCEPTION HANDLING, XMLAGG, XMLQUERY, XMLTABLE, XMLPI, XMLPARSE, and XMLROOT. |
| Bug Fix | Created a new version of the DDL Extractor to correct an issue that results in duplicate entries of Oracle tables defined with the CACHE keyword being emitted to the DDL file.  The Migration Portal has been updated to provide links to the new version of the DDL Extractor.  The Migration Portal is still able to process and assess DDL generated by the older version of the DDL Extractor. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the issue where the PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT declaration is incorrectly reported as an incompatible feature in the Schema Assessment Report “Feature Analysis” section. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the issue where LONG RAW is incorrectly reported as an incompatible feature under the “Feature Analysis” section. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the issue where a user-defined exception declaration is incorrectly reported as an incompatible feature in the Schema Assessment Report “Feature Analysis” section. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the issue where the BULK COLLECT INTO clause is incorrectly reported as an incompatible feature in the Schema Assessment Report “Feature Analysis” section. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the issue where NULLIF function is incorrectly reported as an incompatible feature in the Schema Assessment Report “Feature Analysis” section. |
| Bug Fix | Updated the workaround status of the REGEXP_LIKE clause from  “None / Needs Investigation” to “Exists” in the Schema Assessment Report “Feature Analysis” section. A repair handler is currently available and automatically applied for the REGEXP_LIKE clause. |
| Bug Fix | Updated the list of Oracle predefined PL/SQL exceptions that are supported and not supported by EDB Postgres Advanced Server. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed the issue where the user selection state on the target DDL object selection page is lost if the user opts for a subset of objects (schemas, tables, views etc.) and moves across wizard pages. |
