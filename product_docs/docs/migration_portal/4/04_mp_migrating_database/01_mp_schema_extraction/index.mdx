## Schema extraction methods

You can perform a schema extraction using the EDB or Oracle extraction tools. For instructions and examples, see:

 -  [EDB DDL Extractor](edb_ddl_extractor) (recommended method)
 -  [Oracle Data Pump utilities](01_data_pump_utility/) 

EDB recommends using the EDB DDL extractor to extract your schemas.
Alternatively, you can use Oracleâ€™s Data Pump (IMPDP/EXPDP) tool to export schemas from an Oracle database. 

!!!warning 
   If you choose to extract schemas using a different method and then upload the DDL file to Migration Portal, the portal may not be able to assess the file correctly.
!!!

For more information, see [Known issues, limitations, and notes](/migration_portal/latest/known_issues_notes/).
