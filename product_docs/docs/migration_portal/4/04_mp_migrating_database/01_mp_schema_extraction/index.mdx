You can perform a schema extraction using either of the following methods. EDB recommends using the EDB DDL extractor to extract your schemas.
 -  [EDB DDL Extractor](#extracting-schemas-using-the-edb-ddl-extractor) (recommended method)
 -  [Oracle Data Pump utilities](01_data_pump_utility/) 

For more information, see [Known issues, limitations, and notes](known_issues_notes/). 

## Extracting schemas using the EDB DDL Extractor

Download the latest EDB DDL Extractor script from the Migration Portal Projects page.

!!! Note
    Migration Portal might become unresponsive for very large SQL files, depending on your system and browser resource availability. To resolve this, try extracting fewer schemas at a time to reduce the SQL file size.

### Prerequisites

You can run the EDB DDL Extractor script in SQL Developer or SQL\*Plus. It uses Oracle’s `DBMS_METADATA` built-in package to extract DDLs for different objects under schemas (specified while running the script). The EDB DDL Extractor creates the DDL file uploaded to the portal and analyzed for EDB Postgres Advanced Server compatibility.

!!! Note
    You must have `CONNECT` and `SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE` roles and `CREATE TABLE` privilege.

#### For SQL\*Plus

1.  Connect to SQL\*Plus and run this command:

    `SQL>@edb_ddl_extractor.sql`

2.  When prompted, if the Oracle user that is running the script has the required privileges, press **Enter** to continue running the script. 

3.  When prompted, provide the schema name. When extracting multiple schemas, use a comma (`‘,’`) as a delimiter.

 !!! Note
     If you want to extract all the user schemas from the current database, don't mention any schema names while extracting. However, we recommend mentioning the schema names that you want to extract.

4.  When prompted, enter the path or directory for the extractor to store the extracted DDL. If you don't specify a path, the extracted DDL is output to the directory where you ran the SQL\*Plus command.
  
5.  When prompted, enter `yes`or `no` depending on whether you want to extract dependent objects from other schemas.

For example, on Linux:

```text
Enter a comma separated list of schemas to be extracted (Default all schemas): HR, SCOTT, FINANCE

Location for output file (Default current location) : /home/oracle/extracted_ddls/

WARNING:

Given schema(s) list may contain objects which are dependent on objects from other schema(s), not mentioned in the list.` `Assessment may fail for such objects. It is suggested to extract all dependent objects together.

Extract dependent object from other schemas?(yes/no) (Default no / Ignored for all schemas option): yes
```
On Windows:

```text
Enter comma separated list of schemas to be extracted (Default all schemas): HR, SCOTT, FINANCE

Location for output file (Default current location) : c:\Users\Example\Desktop\

WARNING:

Given schema(s) list may contain objects which are dependent on objects from other schema(s), not mentioned in the list.` `Assessment may fail for such objects. It is suggested to extract all dependent objects together.

Extract dependent object from other schemas?(yes/no) (Default no / Ignored for all schemas option): yes
```

#### For SQL Developer

After loading the `edb_ddl_extractor.sql` script into SQL Developer and connecting to the source Oracle database, run the script. As the script executes, respond to the prompts.

1.  If the user for the database connection has the required privileges as listed in the **Script Output** tab, select **Yes** to continue running the script.

2.  Enter a comma-separated list of schemas and select **OK**.

3.  Enter the path for the output file and select **OK**. The default is the location of the DDL Extractor script.

4.  Enter `yes` or `no` to extract dependent objects and select **OK**. The default is to not extract dependent objects. 

Output of the DDL Extractor run appears in the Script Output tab. The name of the output file appears after the `Extraction Completed` message in the script output.

!!! Note
    You can also enter single schema name in both SQL\*Plus and SQL Developer.

The script then iterates through the object types in the source database. Once the task is completed, the `.SQL` output is stored at the location you entered (e.g., `c:\Users\Example\Desktop\`).

See [file encoding](known_issues_notes/#file-encoding) for information about the file encoding format expected by Migration Portal.


## Schemas and objects support

The lists and tables that follow show supported and unsupported schemas and objects in Migration Portal.

### Unsupported schemas

Exclude these Oracle systems schemas while generating the SQL dump file.

-   Constraints
-   Indexes (Except LOB indexes and indexes on materialized views)
-   Views
-   Materialized views
-   Triggers
-   Functions
-   Procedures
-   Packages

!!! Note
    COMMENTS on columns, tables, and materialized views are also supported.

### Unsupported object types

-   Editions
