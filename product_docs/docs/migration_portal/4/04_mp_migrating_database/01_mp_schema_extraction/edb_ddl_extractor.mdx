navTitle: Using EDB DDL Extractor
---


Download the latest EDB DDL Extractor script from the Migration Portal Projects page.

!!! Note
    Migration Portal might become unresponsive for very large SQL files, depending on your system and browser resource availability. To resolve this issue, try extracting fewer schemas at a time to reduce the SQL file size.

## Prerequisites

You can run the EDB DDL Extractor script in SQL Developer or SQL\*Plus. It uses Oracle’s `DBMS_METADATA` built-in package to extract DDLs for different objects under schemas (specified while running the script). The EDB DDL Extractor creates the DDL file uploaded to the portal and analyzed for EDB Postgres Advanced Server compatibility.

!!! Note
    You must have `CONNECT` and `SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE` roles and `CREATE TABLE` privilege.

### For SQL\*Plus

1.  Connect to SQL\*Plus and run this command:

    ```sql
    @edb_ddl_extractor.sql
    ```

    The script prompts you to provide the details described in the steps that follow.

1.  If the Oracle user that's running the script has the required privileges, press **Enter** to continue running the script. 

1.  Provide the schema name. When extracting multiple schemas, use a comma (`‘,’`) as a delimiter.

 !!! Note
     If you want to extract all the user schemas from the current database, don't mention any schema names while extracting. However, we recommend mentioning the schema names that you want to extract.

1.  Enter the path or directory for the extractor to store the extracted DDL. If you don't specify a path, the extracted DDL is output to the directory where you ran the SQL\*Plus command.
  
1.  Enter `yes` to extract dependent objects from other schemas or `no` if you don't want to extract them.

1.  Enter `yes` to extract grant statements from other schemas or `no` if you don't want to want to extract them.

## Example

1. Run the extractor script:

   ```text
   @edb_ddl_extractor.sql
   ```

1. Press **Enter**.

1. Specify three schemas by separating them with commas:

   ```text
   Enter a comma separated list of schemas to be extracted (Default all schemas): HR, SCOTT, FINANCE
   ```

1. Enter a path for the output file:

   On Linux, you might use:

   ```text
   Location for output file (Default current location) : /home/oracle/extracted_ddls/
   ```

   Similarly on Windows:

   ```text
   Location for output file (Default current location) : c:\Users\Example\Desktop\
   ```

1. Enter `yes` to extract dependent objects in other schemas:

   ```text
   WARNING:

   Given schema(s) list may contain objects which are dependent on objects 
   from other schema(s), not mentioned in the list.` `Assessment may fail 
   for such objects. It is suggested to extract all dependent objects 
   together.
   Extract dependent object from other schemas?(yes/no) (Default no / Ignored for all schemas option): yes
   ```

1. Enter `yes` to extract grant statements:

   ```text
   Extract GRANT statements?(yes/no) (Default no): yes
   ```

### For SQL Developer

After loading the `edb_ddl_extractor.sql` script into SQL Developer and connecting to the source Oracle database, run the script. As the script executes, respond to the prompts.

1.  If the user for the database connection has the required privileges as listed in the **Script Output** tab, select **Yes** to continue running the script.

2.  Enter a comma-separated list of schemas, and select **OK**.

3.  Enter the path for the output file, and select **OK**. The default is the location of the DDL Extractor script.

4.  Enter `yes` or `no` to extract dependent objects, and select **OK**. The default is not to extract dependent objects. 

5. Enter `yes` or `no` to extract grant statements, and select **OK**. The default is not to extract grant statements.

Output of the DDL Extractor run appears in the Script Output tab. The name of the output file appears after the `Extraction Completed` message in the script output.

!!! Note
    You can also enter single schema name in both SQL\*Plus and SQL Developer.

The script then iterates through the object types in the source database. After the task is completed, the `.SQL` output is stored at the location you entered (for example, `c:\Users\Example\Desktop\`).
