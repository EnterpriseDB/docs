During schema assessment, the following check is performed automatically.

## SPL Check

SPL Check is a code analysis tool that identifies potential runtime errors in your Oracle procedural code. It's an important part of the assessment process when you're migrating to EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS).

All schemas that are assessed with Migration Portal are analyzed by SPL Check. This function, which is based on the [EDB SPL Check](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pg_extensions/spl_check/) extension, detects execution time errors within `FUNCTION`, `PROCEDURE`, `PACKAGE BODY`,`TYPE BODY`, and `TRIGGER` object types.

After the schemas are assessed, any objects that don't pass the check are marked as *failed* in the Migration Portal project, alongside other compatibility issues. This lets you resolve these problems before importing your objects into the destination database, preventing runtime errors later on.

You can distinguish SPL Check errors from other incompatibilities because they are prefixed with `[spl_check]`. After you modify an affected object to fix an issue, select **Reassess** to rerun the check and confirm your edits have resolved the problem.
