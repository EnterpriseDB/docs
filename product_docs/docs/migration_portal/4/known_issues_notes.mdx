## Migration Portal

### Wrapped objects  

Migration Portal can't assess wrapped objects. If you include them in the extracted DDL, they aren't loaded into Migration Portal and aren't included in the count of objects that are assessed. If you want to assess wrapped objects and migrate them to EDB Postgres Advanced Server, include unwrapped versions of the objects in the DDL file that you upload to Migration Portal. The recommended way of doing this is to replace the wrapped versions in the Oracle database with clear-text versions before performing the schema extraction. After performing the schema extraction, you can replace the objects with the wrapped versions.

### File encoding

Migration Portal recommends the `.SQL` output file be in the UTF-8 encoding format. If you upload a `.SQL` file with non-UTF-8 encoding, all the characters that aren't compatible with UTF-8 are converted to the replacement character ‘�’ in the output DDL.

!!! Tip
    You can manually convert the extracted file to the UTF-8 format by using the iconv utility on Linux or the LibIconv utility on Windows. For example, if your database character set is in Latin-1 (ISO-8859-1), you can convert the extracted file to the UTF-8 format, as follows:
 
    `iconv -f iso-8859-1 -t UTF-8 sample.sql > sample_utf8.sql`

### ALTER statements

Except for ALTER TABLE and ALTER TRIGGER, Migration Portal does not process any other ALTER statements in the DDL.

### Users, roles, profiles, and grants ###

The Migration Portal now supports assessing and migrating the Oracle users for the schemas that have been extracted and uploaded.  All the users, roles, and profiles for the schemas associated with a project are grouped together under a GLOBAL_OBJECTS pseudo schema in the Migration Portal views.  Currently, grants of system privileges, object privileges, and roles are included with the DDL of the user object.  Similarly, grants of system and object privileges to roles are included with the DDL of the role objects.

Since the grants are currently attached to the user and role objects, if one or more objects that the user is being granted a permission on fails, the user object itself fails assessment.  To resolve this issue, any grant statements on failed objects can be commented out either using a SQL single line comment (i.e., `--`) for individual statements or a SQL multi-line comment (i.e., `/* */`) for consecutive grant statements and then a reassessment of the object can be performed.  After the failed object corresponding to the failed grant statements have been repaired, the previously failing grant statement can be uncommented and the user object reassessed.

When migrating users, the Migration Portal does not migrate the users' passwords.  The users are created in the target EPAS database without a password.  If it is desired or required that the users be configured with a password, this can be done manually in the target database after the users have been migrated.

The Migration Portal migrates non-DEFAULT profiles assigned to the schema users. Oracle profiles include both password and resource limits.  EDB Postgres Advanced Server only supports the Oracle password related limits.  Resource limits are extracted with the profiles, but only the password limits are uploaded, assessed, and migrated by the Migration Portal.  Also, in the Oracle database, the DEFAULT profile may have been overridden with new limit values.  The DEFAULT profile is not migrated by the Migration Portal.  If it is desired that the DEFAULT profile in EPAS be configured with any limit overrides that have been applied to the Oracle DEFAULT profile, then they have to be applied manually in the target EPAS database by using the ALTER PROFILE statement.

## EDB DDL Extractor

-   The EDB DDL Extractor script doesn't extract objects restored using `Flashback` that still have names like `BIN$b54+4XlEYwPgUAB/AQBWwA==$0`. If you want to extract these objects, you must change the names of the objects and rerun the extraction process.
-   The EDB DDL Extractor extracts `nologging` tables as normal tables. Once these tables are migrated to EDB Postgres Advanced Server, WAL log files are created.
-   The EDB DDL Extractor extracts objects only with VALID status. For any objects that have INVALID status that you want Migration Portal to assess, first update them to VALID.
-   The EDB DDL Extractor doesn't extract objects that were obfuscated using the Oracle wrap feature. As such, these objects aren't included in the set of DDL assessed by the Migration Portal. If you want to assess these objects and migrate them to EDB Postgres Advanced Server, replace the wrapped versions of the objects with nonwrapped versions. See [Wrapped objects](#wrapped-objects) for more information.
-   The EDB DDL Extractor creates Global Temporary tables to store the schema names and their dependency information. These tables are dropped at the end of successful extraction.
-   The EDB DDL Extractor script doesn't extract schemas whose name starts with `PG_` because PostgreSQL doesn't support it. If you want to extract these schemas, you must change the name of the schema before extraction.
-   The EDB DDL Extractor automatically extracts the information for the profiles, roles, and grants.

## Oracle Data Pump utilities

- Migration Portal might fail to parse your SQL file if you create a database link using the IDENTIFIED BY clause with Oracle's quote operator; for example, `IDENTIFIED BY VALUES q'[:1]'`. To parse your file successfully, try using an actual password; for example, `IDENTIFIED BY my_password`.

- The DDL generated by Oracle Data Pump utilities might contain ALTER STATEMENTS such as ALTER FUNCTION, ALTER PACKAGE, and ALTER TYPE, which are not processed by Migration Portal.

- Profiles and roles are not extracted when the Oracle Data Pump is executed in schema mode (i.e., `SCHEMAS` parameter used when executing the `expdp` command). If the schema user being exported has a profile assigned to it, the assessment of the schema user object fails in Migration Portal since the profile is not part of the exported `impdp` file. To correct the issue, remove the profile assignment in the user object target DDL and reassess the user creation object.
