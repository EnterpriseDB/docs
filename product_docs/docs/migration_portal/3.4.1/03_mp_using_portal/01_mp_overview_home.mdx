The Migration Portal home page provides quick access to migration tools.

![The Migration Portal home page.](../images/mp_overview_home.png)

The Migration Portal home page allows access to the following Migration Portal features:

-  **Projects**: The Projects panel displays a list of assessed projects.

-  **Create project**: Select **+ New** to create a project.

!!!Note
    Uploading large DDL files might freeze or crash the browser (depending on the browser and the system resources in use). In this scenario, try running Migration Portal in a different browser or extracting fewer schemas and uploading that file on Migration Portal.

-  **Search projects**: Use the **Search** box to search for projects.

-  **Overview**: The Overview panel provides details about the selected project and displays the compatibility percentage after schema assessment.

-  **Migrate to**: Select **Migrate to** either to download an EDB Postgres Advanced Server compatible `.sql` file or migrate a schema to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server on premises or in the cloud. For more information, see [Schema migration](../04_mp_migrating_database/03_mp_schema_migration/#mp_schema_migration).

-  **Report**: Select **Report** to view and download the schema assessment report.

-  **Delete**: Select **Delete** to delete a selected project.

-  **Warning sign**: A warning message appears if a project or a schema is less than 70% compatible or any DDL doesn’t succeed after multiple attempts.

-  **Upload DDL file**: Select **Upload new schema** to upload a new DDL file.

-  **Schemas**: The Schemas panel displays the assessment result from an uploaded DDL file.

-  **Quick help**: The Quick help panel contains quick links to a few required resources.

-  **Portal Wiki**: Select **Portal Wiki** to access links to product information and more help guides.
