# The 3.4.0 folder includes the 3.0.1, 3.1.0, 3.2.0, 3.3.0 and 3.4.0 changes. We removed the earlier release folders because we only want to display a Version label for Migration Portal documentation reflecting the latest release on Docs 2.0. When preparing for a future release, create your working branch, rename the 3.4.0 folder to the latest version number, and add a redirect for the previous version the Migration Portal section in the file /static/_redirects. To get back to the previous sources use a tag dated between June 23rd and June 27th, 2021.

Migration Portal is a web-based service for migrating Oracle database schemas to the EDB Postgres Advanced Server platform. The Migration Portal assesses and analyzes Oracle database schemas and converts:
-  Types
-  Tables
-  Sequences
-  Constraints
-  Triggers
-  Views
-  Stored procedures
-  Packages
-  Database links (dblinks)
-  Materialized views
-  Indexes

The migration produces DDLs compatible with EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

The user-friendly portal interface simplifies the assessment and migration process. Log in to the portal and start with the [migration process](03_mp_using_portal/03_mp_quick_start).

EnterpriseDB has helped companies migrate their existing database systems to Postgres for years. For more information, see the [EnterpriseDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/).
