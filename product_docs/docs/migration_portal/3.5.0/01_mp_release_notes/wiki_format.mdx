## Version 3.5.0 (02-Feb-2022)

### Support for EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 14
Migration Portal is now certified to support assessments and migrations to EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14. For more information, see the EDB Postgres Advanced Server Guide.

### Removed support for DDL extractor
You no longer have to download the DDL extractor script to extract DDLs for your schemas. You can now use Oracle’s Data Pump utility to extract Object DDLs to an SQL dump file for Migration Portal. For more information, see Extracting Schema guide.

### UI improvements
Improved the UI for a better user experience.

### New Repair Handlers
The following repair handlers are added:

#### ERH-3002: SET_TRANSACTION

Removes the NAME clause and its associated label name from SET TRANSACTION statements. EDB Postgres Advanced Server does not support the NAME clause.

##### Example:

Source

```
SET TRANSACTION READ WRITE NAME 'txn_label_name';
SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY NAME 'txn_label_name';
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE NAME 'txn_label_name';
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED NAME 'txn_label_name';
```
Target

```
SET TRANSACTION READ WRITE ;
SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY ;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL SERIALIZABLE ;
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED ;
```

### Updated Repair Handlers
The following repair handlers are updated:

#### ERH-2011: ORGANIZATION_INDEX_COMPRESS

Enhanced repair handler to remove the OVERFLOW clause from a CREATE TABLE statement to make it compatible with EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

##### Example:

Source

```
CREATE TABLE tab(
	ID NUMBER,
	CONSTRAINT ID_PK PRIMARY KEY (ID)
)ORGANIZATION INDEX NOCOMPRESS OVERFLOW;
Target

CREATE TABLE tab(
	ID NUMBER,
	CONSTRAINT ID_PK PRIMARY KEY (ID)
) ;
```

## Version 3.4.0 (3-Nov-2021)
### Addition of BigAnimal (the cloud platform powered by EDB)
Added option to migrate schemas to EDB Postgres Advanced Server clusters on BigAnimal, the cloud platform powered by EDB

### Assessment of large DDL files
Added support for assessing larger DDL files (up to 1 GB size).

### Extractor Enhancements
- Enhanced the DDL extractor to find and list empty schemas.

- DDL Extractor displays a warning message if the source Oracle version is not supported.

### UI Enhancements
Enhanced the UI for a better user experience.

### Object tree optimization
Optimized the object tree and common failure tree to handle large amount of data.

### New Knowledge Base articles
#### Workaround for Type inheritance

Added a Knowledge Base article to provide a workaround for Type inheritance.

#### AFTER ALTER ON SCHEMA trigger

Added Knowledge Base article for Oracle’s AFTER ALTER ON SCHEMA trigger using EDB Postgres Advanced Server’s Event triggers.

#### Function using Java class

Added Knowledge Base article for Oracle’s feature in which a FUNCTION can use JAVA class using EDB Postgres Advanced Server’s PL/JAVA extension.

### Removed Knowledge Base articles
Removed the following Knowledge Base articles as Migration Portal now automatically repairs the incompatibilities associated with these:

- PIPELINED functions
- BYTE Keyword
- Index having concatenated columns

### New Repair Handlers
The following repair handlers are added:

#### ERH-3001 ALTER_TRIGGER

Removes ALTER TRIGGER &lt;triggerName> ENABLE statement or transforms ALTER TRIGGER &lt;triggerName> DISABLE statements to EDB Postgres Advanced Server compatible syntax. Triggers are enabled by default for EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

##### Example:

Source
```
ALTER TRIGGER HR.TRIG_DEPT_LOG DISABLE;
```

Target
```
ALTER TABLE HR.TBL_DEPT_LOG DISABLE TRIGGER TRIG_DEPT_LOG;
ERH-1014 CASE_STATEMENT_ALIAS
```

Adds AS for EDB Postgres Advanced Server reserved keyword CASE when used in CASE Expressions because in EDB Postgres Advanced Server, for using reserved keywords as an alias, you need to provide AS before alias.

#### Example

Source
```
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION alias_example (input_day varchar2) RETURN number
IS
v_return number;
BEGIN
    SELECT CASE input_day
                WHEN 'SUNDAY' THEN
                    0
                WHEN 'MONDAY' THEN
                    1
           END CASE
    INTO v_return
    FROM dual;
    RETURN v_return;
END;
```

Target
```
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION alias_example (input_day varchar2) RETURN number
IS
v_return number;
BEGIN
    SELECT CASE input_day
                WHEN 'SUNDAY' THEN
                    0
                WHEN 'MONDAY' THEN
                    1
           END AS CASE
    INTO v_return
    FROM dual;
    RETURN v_return;
END;
