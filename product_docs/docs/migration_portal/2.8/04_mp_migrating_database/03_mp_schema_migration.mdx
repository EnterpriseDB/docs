After resolving errors in your schemas, you can use the schemas with a client application such as pgAdmin, ToadEdge, or the PSQL client, or migrate the schema to an EDB Cloud Database Service (CDS) cluster.



**Please Note**: For more information about using Toad Edge with Advanced Server, see [Toad Edge for Postgres](https://www.quest.com/products/toad-edge/toad-edge-postgres.aspx).

**Using PSQL or pgAdmin to Deploy a schema**

After ensuring that the assessed schema is 100% compatible on Migration Portal, you can perform the following steps to deploy a schema using PSQL or pgAdmin:

1.  On the `Project` Page, select the required project.
2.  Click `Export` to download the assessed file.

4.  (For PSQL) Connect to desired Advanced Server using the psql/edb-psql client and run the following command:

    `edb=# \i /exported_ddls_folder/hr_schema/ProjHR_hr.sql`

5.  (For pgAdmin) Connect to the desired database and click `Open`.

6.  Upload the schema and click `Run`.

The Advanced Server instance must be installed in Oracle Mode to enable native compatibility with key Oracle capabilities.
