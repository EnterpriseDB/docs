The following enhancements are added to the Migration Portal for the release 3.1.0:

- Asynchronous/Parallel assessment 

  You can now create multiple projects and run the assessments in parallel, get notified once the assessment completes. Also, use multiple browser tabs to work on projects simultaneously.

- Restructured schema assessment report for enhanced readability along with consolidated information about the incompatible function/package

- Refined object search and filter experience along with other UI enhancements

- Starting this release, Migration Portal detects function/procedure names from the packages which are not supported in EPAS, for example, `'Incompatible function/package found : UTL_FILE.GET_RAW'`, giving a better understanding of error and the migration efforts required.


**Updated Repair Handler**

Repair handlers convert Oracle syntax to Postgres-compatible syntax so that you donâ€™t have to do it manually.

- **ERH-2055 - UNSUPPORTED_USING_INDEX_CLAUSE**

  Updated the repair handler ERH-2055 such that it does not remove GLOBAL indexes from the table definition

- **ERH-1012 - INSERT_STATEMENT_ALIAS**

  Modified the repair handler ERH-102 as it was not firing for scenarios where INSERT statements contained the SELECT statement


- **ERH-2090 - CONVERT_FUNCTION**

  Enhanced the performance for large DDLs

- **ERH-2027 - SESSION_GLOBAL_SEQUENCE**

  Enhanced the accuracy so that it functions correctly for edge case DDLs

- **ERH-2079 - GLOBAL_PARTITIONED_INDEX**

  Removed this so that Global Partitioned Indexes will not be removed

**Knowledge Base**

Knowledge base entries provide workarounds or solutions for the objects that fail during an assessment. You can view and apply the knowledge base solutions to reassess the fail objects.


**New Knowledge Base entries**

Following are the new knowledge base entries added:

- **Workaround for Oracle SQLERRM function**

  The `SQLERRM()` function returns the error message associated with the most recently raised error exception.  You may use Advanced Server supported `SQLCODE` and `SQLERRM` variables in the exception block to get similar results.

- **Workaround for Oracle SQLCODE function**

  In PL/SQL blocks, the `SQLCODE` can be used for getting numeric code of exception, in Advanced Server you can create custom function which can return numeric value of error.

- **Value assignment with %type operator for TYPE definition inside package**

  This syntax is supported starting with Advanced Server v12, hence we recommend upgrading to Advanced Server v12 or above to resolve this error.

- **Global Indexes**

  Global Indexes map one index to multiple partitioned tables. There can be multiple workarounds, for example, aligning partitioning keys across all referencing and referenced tables.

- **Workaround for NESTED Table**

  In Advanced Server, `ARRAY` can be used to achieve the same kind of functionality.

- **Method Overloading**

   In Oracle, users can overload the method inside the package by changing the name of the arguments. As per standard practices, in Advanced Server, users should change the argument type to overload a method.
