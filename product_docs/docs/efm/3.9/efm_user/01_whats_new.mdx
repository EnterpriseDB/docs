The following changes have been made to EDB Postgres Failover Manager to create version 3.9:

-   The prefix of the Failover Manager service name has changed. The new service name is `edb-efm-3.9`.

-   The [use.replay.tiebreaker](04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#use_replay_tiebreaker) property specifies how Failover Manager determines which standby node will assume the role of master if two standby nodes have received the same amount of data.

-   The [reconfigure.num.sync](04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#reconfigure_num_sync) property specifies if Failover Manager will adjust the synchronous_standby_names parameter on the master node.

-   The following properties have been renamed; if you use the upgrade utility to upgrade your Failover Manager installation, they will be automatically updated:

    > -   `pingServerCommand` is now `ping.server.command`
    > -   `pingServerIp` is now `ping.server.ip`
    > -   `virtualIp is now`virtual.ip\`\`
    > -   `virtualIp.interface` is now `virtual.ip.interface`
    > -   `virtualIp.prefix` is now `virtual.ip.prefix`
    > -   `virtualIp.single` is now `virtual.ip.single`
    > -   `db.recovery.dir` is now `db.data.dir`

-   A new notification will alert you if you remove the only promotable standby from a replication scenario.
