Since high-availability and read scalability are not part of the core feature set of EDB Postgres Advanced Server, Advanced Server relies on external tools to provide this functionality. This document focuses on the functionality provided by EDB Failover Manager and Pgpool-II, and discusses the implications of a high-availability architecture formed around these tools.
