The following changes have been made to EDB Postgres Failover Manager to create version 4.1:

-   EFM Pgpool integration scripts have been included in the EFM distribution. This will allow the customers to implement EFM Pgpool HA architecture directly from the deployed software, without using the custom integration scripts.
-   EFM Pgpool HA architecture deployment with Azure Network Load Balancer has been enabled, tested, and documented.
-   Standby Agents attempt to resume health monitoring when local database connectivity is recovered.
-   Option provided to automatically increase `num_sync` when synchronous Standbys are added to a cluster or they rejoin a cluster.
