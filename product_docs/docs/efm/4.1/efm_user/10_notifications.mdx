Failover Manager will send e-mail notifications and/or invoke a notification script when a notable event occurs that affects the cluster. If you have configured Failover Manager to send an email notification, you must have an SMTP server running on port 25 on each node of the cluster. Use the following parameters to configure notification behavior for Failover Manager:

```text
user.email
script.notification
from.email
```

For more information about editing the configuration properties, see [Specifying Cluster Properties](04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#cluster_properties).

The body of the notification contains details about the event that triggered the notification, and about the current state of the cluster. For example:

```text
EFM node: 10.0.1.11
Cluster name: acctg
Database name: postgres
VIP: ip_address (Active|Inactive)
Database health is not being monitored.
```

The VIP field displays the IP address and state of the virtual IP if implemented for the node.

Failover Manager assigns a severity level to each notification. The following levels indicate increasing levels of attention required:

-   `INFO` indicates an informational message about the agent and does not require any manual intervention (for example, Failover Manager has started or stopped). See [List of INFO level notifications](#notifications_info)
-   `WARNING` indicates that an event has happened that requires the administrator to check on the system (for example, failover has occurred). See [List of WARNING level notifications](#notifications_warning)
-   `SEVERE` indicates that a serious event has happened and requires the immediate attention of the administrator (for example, failover was attempted, but was unable to complete). See [List of SEVERE level notifications](#notifications_severe)

The severity level designates the urgency of the notification. A notification with a severity level of `SEVERE` requires user attention immediately, while a notification with a severity level of `INFO` will call your attention to operational information about your cluster that does not require user action. Notification severity levels are not related to logging levels; all notifications are sent regardless of the log level detail specified in the configuration file.

You can use the [notification.level](04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#notification_level) property to specify the minimum severity level that will trigger a notification.

!!! Note
    In addition to sending notices to the administrative email address, all notifications are recorded in the cluster log file (`/var/log/efm-4.1/<cluster_name>.log`).

The conditions listed in the table below will trigger an `INFO` level notification:

| Possible problem with database timeout values                            | Your remote.timeout value (value) is higher than your local.timeout value (value). If the local database takes too long to respond, the local agent could assume that the database has failed though other agents can connect. While this will not cause a failover, it could force the local agent to stop monitoring, leaving you without failover protection.                                     |

| Primary database being fenced off for cluster cluster_name                 | The primary database has been isolated from the majority of the cluster. The cluster is telling the primary agent at ip_address to fence off the primary database to prevent two primarys when the rest of the failover manager cluster promotes a standby.                                                                                                            |

| Primary database being fenced off for cluster cluster_name                 | The primary database has been isolated from the majority of the cluster. Before the primary could finish detecting isolation, a standby was promoted and has rejoined this node in the cluster. This node is isolating itself to avoid more than one primary database.                                                                                                 |

| Agent is timing out for cluster cluster_name                               | This agent has timed out trying to reach the local database. After the timeout, the agent could successfully ping the database and has resumed monitoring. However, the node should be checked to make sure it is performing normally to prevent a possible database or agent failure.                                                                                 |

| Internal state mismatch for cluster cluster_name                           | The failover manager cluster's internal state did not match the actual state of the cluster members. This is rare and can be caused by a timing issue of nodes joining the cluster and/or changing their state. The problem should be resolved, but you should check the cluster status as well to verify. Details of the mismatch can be found in the agent log file. |
