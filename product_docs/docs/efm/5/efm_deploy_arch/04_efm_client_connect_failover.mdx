Most of the PostgreSQL connection libraries support
client connection failover. These libraries support connection strings
with more than one database server. On first connection attempt or when the connection is lost 
(which also occurs during a failover), the client driver connects to the supplied hosts one by one until it finds a read-write connection. 
The time for reconnecting to the new
master depends on the connection timeouts as configured in
the driver and TCP layer.

## Using Failover Manager with Client Connection failover 

### Installing

Install and configure Advanced Server and Failover Manager on three servers as follows:

  Systems                                    | Components
  -------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
  PG Primary, PG Standby1, and PG Standby2   | Primary or standby nodes running Advanced Server and Failover Manager
  

You don't need to configure the virtual IP configuration in `efm.properties` (`virtual.ip`,
`virtual.ip.interface`, `virtual.ip.prefix`, and `virtual.ip.single`).

### Configuring Client Connection failover


 Driver          | Client Connection failover support| Version supported       | Configuration 
-----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------|---------------------------------
 JDBC            | Yes                               | All supported versions  | Supply multiple hosts in the connection string, and set the `targetServerType` attribute as primary. Example: `jdbc:postgresql://host1:5444,host2:5444/accounting?targetServerType=primary`. More information: https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/connect.html#connection-failover 
 libpq           | Yes                               | 10 and above            | Supply multiple hosts in the connection string, and set the `target_session_attrs` attribute as read-write. Example: `postgresql://host1:5444,host2:5444/edb?target_session_attrs=read-write`. More information: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING  
 .NET            | Yes                               | 6 and above             | Supply multiple hosts in the connection string, and set the Target Session Attributes attribute as primary. Example: `Host=host1,host2;Username=test;Password=test;Target Session Attributes=primary`. More information: https://www.npgsql.org/doc/failover-and-load-balancing.html
 go - jackc/pgx  | Yes                               | 5 and above             | Use `libpq` syntax as shown above. More information: https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/jackc/pgx#ConnConfig
 psycopyg3       | Yes                               | All supported versions  | Use `libpq` syntax as shown above. More information: https://www.psycopg.org/psycopg3/docs/api/connections.html
 OCL             | Yes                               | 10 and above            | OCL is based on `libpq`, hence check `libpq` for details. 
 ODBC            | No                                |                         |
