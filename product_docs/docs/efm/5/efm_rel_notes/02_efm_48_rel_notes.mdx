title: "Version 4.8"

Enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in EFM 4.8 include:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Enhancement | The minimum Java version required to run Failover Manager is now version 11 instead of 8. |
| Enhancement | New CLI command 'efm reset-members added' to remove cached node addreses after a node is removed from a cluster. [Support ticket: #1047118]|
| Enhancement | Encryption/decryption of database password will now work in a FIPS environment. [Support ticket: #90803, #90805] |
| Enhancement | Changed the order to retrieve WAL replay/receive queries from a standby during a cluster status call. This can help avoid confusing output when the database cluster is under load. |
| Enhancement | Failover Manager will now log more information about outside processes attempting to connect to a running agent's address/port. |
| Enhancement | Failover Manager has been upgraded to use PostgreSQL JDBC Driver version 42.6.0. |
| Enhancement | Failover Manager agents can be started before the local database has been initialized. |
| Enhancement | Failover Manager warns the user and doesn't start if the `ping.server.ip` property is set to the virtual IP address. Setting these to the same value breaks network connectivity checks when the VIP is dropped during a switchover. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an edge case that could result in two primary nodes in the case of an even split of a cluster (for example, between two data centers with equal number of nodes). |
| Bug Fix | To prevent edge cases of other nodes logging warnings about cluster communication problems, during a cluster shutdown, the coordinator waits a couple of seconds before exiting . [Support ticket #96840]|
| Bug Fix | Fixed a rare timing case that could result in a primary database failure being ignored because of a simultaneous cluster status check. [Support ticket: #98428] |
