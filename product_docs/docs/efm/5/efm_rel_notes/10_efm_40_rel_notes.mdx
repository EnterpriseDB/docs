Released: 02 Sep 2021

Enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in EFM 4.0 include:

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Enhancement | Properties were renamed. See the table that follows for details. If you use the upgrade utility to upgrade your Failover Manager installation, they are automatically updated. |
| Enhancement | The property value for the encrypted database password needs to be updated to meet the new hashing algorithm. The upgrade tool will make the required changes. When creating the properties file manually, you can use the standard procedure for encrypting the password instead. |
| Enhancement | Encryption for database password was improved. Encryption was also enabled for communication between the agents. |
| Enhancement | Standby servers are no longer stopped while selecting the new primary. This enhancement significantly speeds up the promotion process.
| Enhancement | To be consistent with community naming guidelines, the term "master" was replaced with "primary" in the Failover Manager product and documentation. The upgrade-conf tool handles the task of renaming the impacted properties post upgrade. The load balancer scripts such as `script.load.balancer.attach`, `script.load.balancer.detach` now accept the character `p` instead of `m` as an argument.
| Enhancement | Support was added to delay the restart of standbys after a promotion. You can increase the availability by staggering the restart of standbys.
| Bug Fix | Documentation was updated to aid users who use tmpfs mount points for `/var/run` and `/var/lock` [Support Ticket #977437]
| Bug Fix | An IDLE agent will attempt to resume monitoring when other agents can reach its database. [Support Ticket #1001533] |
