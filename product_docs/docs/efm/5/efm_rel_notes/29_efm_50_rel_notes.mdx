Enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in EFM 5.0 include:

| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                              | Addresses              |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Enhancement | The startup log is no longer used by Failover Manager agents. Agent startup information now goes to systemd or standard out, depending on how the agent was started.     |                        |
| Enhancement | New CLI command `efm create-standby` added to create standby databases from an existing primary using `pg_basebackup`.                                                   |                        |
| Enhancement | Failover Manager now simplifies handling cluster size for quorum purposes. Failed nodes/agents are still part of a cluster until removed.                                |                        |
| Enhancement | Added new `backup.wal'` property to control whether or not standby WAL is backed up during reconfiguration.                                                              | 1277862, 91506, 101026 |
| Enhancement | The `auto.resume.period` property has been split into two new properties, one for agent startup and one for database failures.                                           |                        |
| Enhancement | Added new `check.num.sync.period` property to control how often a primary database is checked for synchronous standbys.                                                  | 1133047, 91506         |
| Enhancement | Removed unnecessary check of database operating system user in sudoers configuration file.                                                                               | 42594, 99957           |
| Enhancement | Removed unnecessary network status check that was added for older operating systems.                                                                                     |                        |
| Enhancement | Table information in `efm cluster-status` output now resizes to handle long host names.                                                                                  | 101878                 |
| Enhancement | Updated "xlog" references in `efm cluster-status-json` output to use "lsn" instead.                                                                                      |                        |
| Enhancement | Changed the default `detach.on.agent.failure` behavior to match the suggested value.                                                                                     |                        |
| Enhancement | Added more cluster size checks during failures to improve split brain safety during network outages that result in gradual node isolation.                               |                        |
| Enhancement | Removed local database checks after an agent cannot connect that produced confusing logging.                                                                             |                        |
| Enhancement | Added more information in some cases when an agent cannot connect to a database.                                                                                         |                        |
| Enhancement | Failover Manager was upgraded to use JGroups version 5.4.4.                                                                                                              |                        |
| Enhancement | Failover Manager was upgraded to use PostgreSQL JDBC Driver version 42.7.3.                                                                                              |                        |
| Enhancement | Failover Manager was upgraded to use Log4J version 2.24.3.                                                                                                               |                        |
| Enhancement | Failover Manager was upgraded to use Jakarta Mail version 2.0.1.                                                                                                         |                        |
| Enhancement | Failover Manager was upgraded to use Json-Simple version 1.1.1.                                                                                                          |                        |
| Bug Fix     | Fixed agent shutdown code that could cause a `systemctl stop` call to finish before the agent completes shutdown, resulting in the agent process not exiting gracefully. | 37270                  |
| Bug Fix     | Handle a case where an agent on a failed/rebooted standby node attempts to join the cluster before the previous agent from the same host has timed out.                  | 43162                  |
| Bug Fix     | Removed `efm upgrade-conf` support for very old Failover Manager version passwords. In rare cases, this support was causing upgrade failures.                            |                        |
| Bug Fix     | Fixed an issue where a failed user fencing script could cause a temporary internal state mismatch.                                                                       |                        |
| Bug Fix     | Added missing descriptive output about node statuses in some cases when returned to an agent collecting cluster status information.                                      |                        |
| Bug Fix     | Added `jdbc.properties` property to properties template to avoid losing it during a configuration upgrade.                                                               |                        |
