| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Addresses              |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Enhancement | Failover Manager now supports reconfiguring failed primary database servers as standbys, using pg_rewind if needed.                                                                                           |                        |
| Enhancement | The `efm create-standby` command no longer requires superuser privileges to run.                                                                                                                              |                        |
| Enhancement | Added `-waldir` option for the `efm create-standby` command to specify a non-default location for the write-ahead log directory.                                                                              |                        |
| Enhancement | Added new `check.vip.timeout` property to control how long to wait during promotion for the VIP (if used) to become unavailable.                                                                              |                        |
| Enhancement | Added new properties `release.vip.*` to control the timing of when the VIP is released during a promotion. This can avoid certain network issues that prevent database connections, e.g. during a switchover. | 52388, 48276           |
| Enhancement | Added new `jdbc.loglevel` property to control the amount of detail logged when attempting to create database connections.                                                                                     |                        |
| Enhancement | Updated the notification sent when there is an unexpected error transferring the internal cluster state.                                                                                                      | 46361                  |
| Enhancement | Failover Manager will now check for unknown properties at startup to catch potentially confusing user error.                                                                                                  |                        |
| Enhancement | Failover Manager was upgraded to use the Bouncy Castle cryptographic library version 2.1.1.                                                                                                                   |                        |
| Bug Fix     | Fixed a bug that could prevent database failover if the primary was created with `efm create-standby` while it was still a running standby database.                                                          |                        |
| Bug Fix     | Fixed a regression that did not give a useful error message when the `bind.address` property was not in the proper format.                                                                                    |                        |
| Bug Fix     | Removed a confusing message when the `efm cluster-status` command was run with too many parameters.                                                                                                           |                        |
