| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                     | Addresses              |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Enhancement | Failover Manager now supports automatically rebuilding failed database servers as standbys using pg_rewind or pg_basebackup.                                                    |                        |
| Enhancement | To improve performance, an agent will skip checking the health of disconnected standby databases if the agent determines that it has become isolated.                           |                        |
| Enhancement | Added timing and stack trace information to make the output consistent when there are database connection failures during regular monitoring and an agent's final health check. |                        |
| Bug Fix     | Fixed a regression in 5.1 that prevented someone from using the `efm create-standby` command if the database had not been initialized yet.                                      |                        |
| Bug Fix     | Fixed a bug that prevented an agent from starting if its local database has not been initialized in certain cases.                                                              |                        |
| Bug Fix     | Changed the error message output when an invalid property name is used to avoid confusion.                                                                                      |                        |
| Bug&nbsp;Fix     | Removed unnecessary output about releasing the VIP when a VIP is not being used.                                                                                                  |                        |
