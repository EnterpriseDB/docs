Configuring a replication scenario can be complex. For detailed information about configuration options, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/warm-standby.html#STREAMING-REPLICATION).

You might want to use a `.pgpass` file to enable md5 authentication for the replication user. This might not be the safest authentication method for your environment. For more information about the supported authentication options, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/client-authentication.html).

!!! Note
    Failover Manager uses `pg_ctl` utility for standby promotion. You don't need to set the `trigger_file` or `promote_trigger_file` parameter for promotion of a standby server.

## Limited support for cascading replication

While Failover Manager doesn't provide full support for cascading replication, it does provide limited support for simple failover in a cascading replication scenario. Cascading replication allows a standby node to stream to another standby node, reducing the number of connections (and processing overhead) to the primary node.

For detailed information about configuring cascading replication, see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/warm-standby.html#CASCADING-REPLICATION).

To use Failover Manager in a cascading replication scenario, modify the cluster properties file, setting the following property values on standby node #2:

```ini
promotable=false
auto.reconfigure=false
```

In the event of a failover, standby node #1 is promoted to the role of primary node. If failover occurs, standby node #2 continues to act as a read-only replica for the new primary node until you take actions to manually reconfigure the replication scenario to contain three nodes.

In the event of a failure of standby node #1, you won't have failover protection, but you'll receive an email notifying you of the failure of the node.

!!! Note
    Performing a switchover and switch back to the original primary might not preserve the cascading replication scenario.
