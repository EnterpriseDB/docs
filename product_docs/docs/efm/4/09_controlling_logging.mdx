Failover Manager writes and stores one log file per agent and one startup log per agent in `/var/log/<cluster_name>-4`.

You can control the level of detail written to the agent log by modifying the `jgroups.loglevel` and `efm.loglevel` parameters in the [cluster properties file](04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#loglevel):

```text
# Logging levels for JGroups and EFM.
# Valid values are: TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
# Default value: INFO
# It is not necessary to increase these values unless debugging a
# specific issue. If nodes are not discovering each other at
# startup, increasing the jgroups level to DEBUG will show
# information about the TCP connection attempts that may help
# diagnose the connection failures.
jgroups.loglevel=INFO
efm.loglevel=INFO
```

The logging facilities use the Java logging library and logging levels. The log levels, in order from most logging output to least, are:

-   `TRACE`
-   `DEBUG`
-   `INFO`
-   `WARN`
-   `ERROR`

For example, if you set the `efm.loglevel` parameter to `WARN`, Failover Manager only logs messages at the `WARN` level and above, that is, `WARN` and `ERROR`.

By default, Failover Manager log files are rotated daily, compressed, and stored for a week. You can modify the file rotation schedule by changing settings in the log rotation file (`/etc/logrotate.d/efm-4.<x>`). For more information about modifying the log rotation schedule, consult the logrotate man page:

```
$ man logrotate
```

## Enabling syslog log file entries

Failover Manager supports syslog logging. To implement syslog logging, you must configure syslog to allow UDP or TCP connections.

To allow a connection to syslog, edit the `/etc/rsyslog.conf` file and uncomment the protocol you want to use. Also make sure that the `UDPServerRun` or `TCPServerRun` entry associated with the protocol includes the port number to which log entries are sent. For example, the following configuration file entries enable UDP connections to port 514:

```text
# Provides UDP syslog reception
$ModLoad imudp
$UDPServerRun 514
```

The following configuration file entries enable TCP connections to port 514:

```text
# Provides TCP syslog reception
$ModLoad imtcp
$InputTCPServerRun 514
```

After modifying the syslog configuration file, restart the `rsyslog` service to enable the connections:

> `systemctl restart rsyslog.service`

After modifying the `rsyslog.conf` file on the Failover Manager host, modify the Failover Manager properties to enable logging. Use your choice of editor to [modify the properties file](04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#logtype_enabled) `/etc/edb/efm-4.<x>/efm.properties.in`, specifying the type of logging that you want to implement:

```text
# Which logging is enabled.
file.log.enabled=true
syslog.enabled=false
```

You must also [specify syslog details](04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#syslog_logging) for your system. Use the `syslog.protocol` parameter to specify the protocol type (UDP or TCP) and the `syslog.port` parameter to specify the listener port of the syslog host. You can use the `syslog.facility` value as an identifier for the process that created the entry. Use a value between `LOCAL0` and `LOCAL7`.

```text
# Syslog information. The syslog service must be listening # on the
 port for the given protocol, which can be UDP or
# TCP. The facilities supported are LOCAL0 through LOCAL7.
# syslog.host=localhost
syslog.port=514
syslog.protocol=UDP
syslog.facility=LOCAL1
```

For more information about syslog, see the syslog man page:

 `syslog man`
