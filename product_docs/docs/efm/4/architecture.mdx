Failover Manager is a high-availability tool that monitors the health
of a Postgres streaming replication cluster and verifies failures
quickly. When a database failure occurs, Failover Manager can
automatically promote a streaming replication standby node into a
writable primary node. This capability ensures continued performance and protects
against data loss with minimal service interruption.

A Failover Manager cluster is made up of Failover Manager processes
that reside on the following hosts on a network:

-   A primary node is the primary database server that is servicing
    database clients.

-   One or more standby nodes are streaming replication servers
    associated with the primary node.

-   The witness node confirms assertions of either the primary or a
    standby in a failover scenario. If, during a failure situation, the
    primary is in a partition with half or more of the nodes,
    it stays primary. As such, Failover Manager supports running in
    a cluster with an even number of agents.


![A Failover Manager scenario employing a virtual IP address](images/failover_manager_overview.png)

When a non-witness agent starts, it connects to the local database and checks the state of the database:

-   If the agent can't reach the database, it starts in idle mode.
-   If it finds that the database is in recovery, the agent assumes the role of standby.
-   If the database isn't in recovery, the agent assumes the role of primary.

In the event of a failover, Failover Manager attempts to ensure that the promoted standby is the most up-to-date standby in the cluster. Data loss is possible if the standby node is not in sync with the primary node.

[JGroups](http://www.jgroups.org/) provides technology that allows Failover Manager to create clusters whose member nodes can communicate with each other and detect node failures.

The figure illustrates a Failover Manager cluster that uses a virtual IP address. You can use a load balancer in place of a [virtual IP address](04_configuring_efm/05_using_vip_addresses/#using_vip_addresses) if you provide your own [script](04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#cluster_properties) to reconfigure the load balancer whenever databases are added or removed. You can also choose to enable native EFM-Pgpool integration for high availability. See [Choosing a deployment architecture](efm_deploy_arch) for more information.
