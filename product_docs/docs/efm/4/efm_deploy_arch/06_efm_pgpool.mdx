Pgpool-II is a popular connection pooler that can provide many capabilities, like read-only traffic load balancing, 
connection pooling, and running as a clustered proxy. With Failover Manager to manage availability and reconfiguring 
EDB Pgpool-II to proxy to the correct primary, the setup can deliver high availability in an on-premises setup as well as 
in a cloud setup.


## Failover Manager with EDB Pgpool-II on premises

For an on-premises setup, you can use a VIP to route the traffic to an available EDB Pgpool-II instance. In this setup, 
the automatic failover of EDB Pgpool-II is disabled, and Failover Manager is configured to manage EDB Pgpool-II.

## Failover Manager with EDB Pgpool-II in the cloud

For environments with network load balancers (e.g., cloud environments), you can use a network load balancer (NLB) to balance 
the traffic over all available EDB Pgpool-II instances without requiring a VIP.

## Using Failover Manager with EDB Pgpool-II 

### Installing

Install and configure Advanced Server database, Failover Manager, and
EDB Pgpool-II as follows:

  
  **Systems**                           |  **Components**
  --------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PgDB server 1, server2, and server 3  | Primary / standby node running Advanced Server 13 and Failover Manager 4.2
  EDB Pgpool-II                                |Pgpool node running EDB Pgpool-II 4.2 in a watchdog configuration. Register these three nodes as targets in the target group. Three is the minimum and is sufficient for most cases.
  
  

EDB does not support this architecture with EDB Pgpool-II and
Failover Manager/PostgreSQL running on the same machines for the
following reasons:

-   A restriction with cloud network load balancers doesn't route
    traffic properly when source and destination reside on the same
    machines.

-   In mixed architecture, traffic between Pgpool and Postgres can
    become unbalanced.

-   Pgpool and PostgreSQL might compete for resources.

### Configuring Failover Manager

Failover Manager can remove failed database
nodes from EDB Pgpool-II load balancing. It can also reattach nodes to EDB Pgpool-II
when returned to the Failover Manager cluster. To configure Failover
Manager for high availability using EDB Pgpool-II, you must set the following
properties in the cluster properties file:

```ini
    pgpool.enable = true

    pcp.user = User invoking PCP commands

    pcp.host = Virtual IP of EDB Pgpool-II or IP of NLB

    pcp.port = 9898

    pcp.pass.file = Absolute path of PCPPASSFILE

    pgpool.bin = Absolute path of pgpool bin directory
```

### Configuring EDB Pgpool-II

You can configure some important parameters in the
`pgpool.conf` file to integrate EDB Pgpool-II with Failover Manager.

#### Backend node setting

There are three PostgreSQL backend nodes: one primary and two standby
nodes. Configure using backend_* configuration parameters in
`pgpool.conf`, and use the equal backend weights for all nodes. This
makes the read queries distributed equally among all nodes.

```ini

    backend_hostname0 = 'server1_IP'

    backend_port0 = 5444

    backend_weight0 = 1

    backend_flag0 = 'ALLOW_TO_FAILOVER'

    backend_hostname1 = 'server2_IP'

    backend_port1 = 5444

    backend_weight1 = 1

    backend_flag1 = 'ALLOW_TO_FAILOVER'

    backend_hostname2 = 'server3_IP'

    backend_port2 = 5444

    backend_weight2 = 1

    backend_flag2 = 'ALLOW_TO_FAILOVER'
```

#### Enabling load balancing and streaming replication mode

Set the following configuration parameter in the `pgpool.conf` file to enable load balancing and streaming replication mode:

-   For EDB Pgpool-II version 4.2:

    ```ini 
        backend_clustering_mode = 'streaming_replication'

        load_balance_mode = on
    ```

-  For EDB Pgpool-II versions prior to 4.2:

    ```ini
        master_slave_mode = on

        master_slave_sub_mode = 'stream'

        load_balance_mode = on
    ```

#### Disabling health checking and failover

Health checking and failover are handled by Failover Manager, so disable them on the EDB Pgpool-II side. To disable the
health check and failover on EDB Pgpool-II side, assign the following
values:

```ini

    health_check_period = 0

    failover_on_backend_error = off

    failover_if_affected_tuples_mismatch = off

    failover_command = ''

    failback_command = ''
```

Ensure the following while setting up the values in the pgpool.conf
file:

-   Keep the value of `wd_priority` in `pgpool.conf` different on each
    node. The node with the highest value gets the highest priority.

-   The properties `backend_hostname0`, `backend_hostname1`,
    `backend_hostname2`, and so on are shared properties (in Failover Manager terms)
    and must hold the same value in the `pgpool.conf` file on all the EDB Pgpool-II nodes.

-   Update the correct interface value in `if_ *` and `arping` cmd props
    in the `pgpool.conf` file.

-   Add the properties `heartbeat_destination0`, `heartbeat_destination1`,
    `heartbeat_destination2`, and so on as per the number of nodes in the
    `pgpool.conf` file on every node. Here set `heartbeat_destination0`
    to the IP address or hostname of the local node.

#### Setting up PCP

The script uses the PCP interface, so you need to set up the PCP and
`.PCPPASS` file to allow PCP connections without a password prompt.

To set up PCP, see:
[Configuring pcp.conf](http://www.pgpool.net/docs/latest/en/html/configuring-pcp-conf.html).

To set up PCPPASS, see:
[PCP commands](https://www.pgpool.net/docs/latest/en/html/pcp-commands.html).

The load balancing is turned on to ensure read scalability by
distributing read traffic across the standby nodes.

The health checking and error-triggered backend failover are
turned off, as Failover Manager is responsible for performing
health checks and triggering failover. We do not recommend using EDB Pgpool-II to
perform health checking in this case, to avoid a conflict
with Failover Manager or prematurely performing failover.

Finally, `search_primary_node_timeout` is set to a low value to
ensure prompt recovery of EDB Pgpool-II services upon a Failover
Manager-triggered failover.

#### Using virtual IP addresses

Both EDB Pgpool-II and Failover Manager provide the functionality to employ
a virtual IP for seamless failover. While both provide this capability,
the EDB Pgpool-II leader is the process that receives the application
connections through the virtual IP. As in this design, such virtual IP
management is performed by the EDB Pgpool-II watchdog system. Failover
Manager VIP doesn't help in this design, so disable it.

In a failure situation of the active instance of EDB Pgpool-II (the
primary EDB Pgpool-II server in our sample architecture), the next available
standby EDB Pgpool-II instance (according to watchdog priority) is activated
and takes charge as the leader EDB Pgpool-II instance.

### Configuring the network load balancer

For Failover Manager / EDB Pgpool-II integration using the network load balancer in
AWS or Azure, you need to perform some additional steps.

Add the following rules to the security groups to be used by the EDB Pgpool-II instances:

-   Rules for the security group to be used by the EDB Pgpool-II instances (SG
    Pgpool).

    Type      | Protocol      |   Port range   |   Source       |   Description
  ------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------
  Custom TCP  | TCP           | 9000           |  Entire Subnet |  Watchdog
  Custom TCP  | TCP           | 9694           |  Entire Subnet |  Heartbeat
  Custom TCP  | TCP           | 9898           |  Entire Subnet |  pcp
  Custom TCP  | TCP           | 9999           |  Entire Subnet |  Pgpool

 In addition to these rules, add the rules for SSH and Ping as per your requirement.

-   Rules for the security group to be used by the database instances
    (SG DB):

     Type      | Protocol      |   Port range   |   Source       |   Description
  ------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------
  Custom TCP  | TCP           | 7800           | Entire Subnet  | Failover Manager
  Custom TCP  | TCP           | 5444           | Entire Subnet  |Postgres
 

 Setting these rules ensures that the ports required to run the database, Failover  Manager, and EDB Pgpool-II are open for 
 communication between the nodes and
 the load balancer for traffic routing and health monitoring.

 In addition to these rules, add the rules for SSH and Ping as per your requirement.

#### Configuring NLB in Azure

If using AWS, see [Configuring NLB in AWS](#config_nlb_aws).

After configuring the rules described in [Creating rules for security groups](#sg_rules_pgpool), follow the Azure 
documentation to:

-  Create a backend pool consisting of all the virtual machines running EDB Pgpool-II instances. Use the private IPs of the virtual machines to create the backend pool.

-  Add a health probe to check if the EDB Pgpool-II instance is available on the virtual machines. Set the protocol to `TCP` and the port to `9999`.

-  Add two load balancing rules, one each for port `9898` and port `9999`. These rules ensure that the network traffic coming toward that port is distributed evenly among all the virtual machines present in the backend pool. Set the type to `Public` load balancer or `Internal` load balancer.

After completing these configurations, you can connect to the database
on the IP address of the network load balancer on port 9999. If a
failure occurs on the primary database server, Failover Manager
promotes a new primary and then reconfigures EDB Pgpool-II to redistribute
traffic. If any of the EDB Pgpool-II processes is not available to accept
traffic, the network load balancer redistributes all the
traffic to the remaining two EDB Pgpool-II processes. Make sure that the
`listen_backlog_multiplier` parameter is tuned to compensate for the
higher number of connections in case of failover.

#### Configuring NLB in AWS

The following assumptions have been taken for the sample configuration:

-  All the EC2 instances and the load balancer are deployed in the same
    subnet. If required, you can add the database nodes to
    another subnet, but that requires a more complex configuration and
    might have a performance impact.

-  There is a security group for EDB Pgpool-II and a security group for the
    database instances.

After configuring the rules described in [Creating rules for security groups](#sg_rules_pgpool), follow the AWS documentation to:

-   Create two target groups with the following details:

     Name          | Type           | Protocol       |   Port         |   VPC
    ---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------
    pcp            | Instances      | TCP            |  9898          |  Select the VPC to which the instances are connected.
    pgpool         | Instances      | TCP            |  9999          |  Select the VPC to which the instances are connected.
      
    Leave the rest of the settings (**Health check TCP** and **Advanced health check** settings) as default.

    Register the created target groups with the instances that are running PgBouncer.

-   Create a load balancer with the following details:

     Type                                                                  | VPC                                           | Listener                                                                                                                                                                | 
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    `Public` or `Internal`. EDB recommends using an internal load balancer.| Choose a VPC and map it to the desired zones. | Create a listener with `TCP` set to `9898`, and forward it to the target group pcp. Create another listener with `TCP` set to `9999`, and forward it to the target group pgpool.|
 

After completing the configurations, you can connect to the database on
the IP address of the network load balancer on port 9999. If a failure
occurs on the primary database server, Failover Manager promotes a
new primary and then reconfigures EDB Pgpool-II to redistribute traffic. If any
of the EDB Pgpool-II processes is not available to accept traffic,
the network load balancer redistributes all the traffic to the
remaining two EDB Pgpool-II processes. Make sure that
`listen_backlog_multiplier` is tuned to compensate for the higher number
of connections in case of failover.
