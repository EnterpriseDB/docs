Failover Manager provides support for clusters that use a virtual IP (VIP).

## Using Failover Manager with VIP

### Installing

Install and configure the Advanced Server database and Failover Manager
on three servers as following:

  
  Systems                                   |Components
  ------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PG Primary, PG Standby1, and PG Standby2  | Primary / standby nodes running Advanced Server 13 and Failover Manager 4.2
  

### Specifying VIP

In the cluster properties file, provide the hostname or IP address in
the `virtual.ip` property. Specify the corresponding prefix in the
`virtual.ip.prefix` property. Use the `virtual.ip.interface` property to
provide the network interface used by the VIP. By default, the
`virtual.ip` and `virtual.ip.prefix` values are the same across all the
agents.

The specified virtual IP address is assigned only to the primary node of
the cluster. If you specify `virtual.ip.single=true`, the same VIP address
is used on the new primary during a failover. Specify a
value of `false` to provide a unique IP address for each node of the
cluster.

For information about using a virtual IP address, see [Using Failover Manager with virtual IP addresses](../efm_user/04_configuring_efm/05_using_vip_addresses/#using_vip_addresses).
