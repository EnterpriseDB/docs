For ensuring the high availability of your database, core features of Failover Manager can be combined with the Postgres connection libraries (client connect failover) and/or connection poolers.

With the capabilities of Failover Manager, EDB has designed four basic
architectures to run a High availability environment:

1. [Failover Manager using VIP (virtual IP)](03_efm_vip): Failover Manager has a key
capability to manage VIP addresses out of the box. VIP addresses
allow applications to connect to a single IP address, which is being
routed to the Primary database server. This architecture is the most
basic solution to run when VIP addresses are available in your
environment.

2. [Failover Manager using client connect failover](04_efm_client_connect_failover):
PostgreSQL client libraries like libpq and jdbc allow for Client
Connection Failover. With Client Connection failover, the connection
string will contain multiple servers (host=srv1,srv2), and the
client library will loop over the available hosts to find a
connection that is available and capable of Read/Write operations.
This capability allows clients to follow the master during a
switchover. This solution does not rely on Virtual IP addresses and
can be used in every environment where such client configurations
can be set.

3. [Failover Manager with PgBouncer](05_efm_pgbouncer): PgBouncer adds a lot of capabilities such as connection pooling and the option to halt traffic. It can additionally be used as a proxy between the Client and the Postgres Database Server. By leveraging the integration options in Failover Manager to run reconfiguration of PgBouncer during a
Failover, PgBouncer can be used to route the traffic to the correct
primary database server.

4. [Failover Manager with Pgpool](06_efm_pgpool): Pgpool-II is
another tool that is used as a proxy between the Client and the
Postgres Database Server. Pgpool-II adds a lot of capabilities such
as running in cluster mode with a Watchdog, managing VIP's, and
Read-Only scalability. Failover Manager has native capabilities to
integrate with Pgpool-II to redirect traffic to another primary
during Database failover overations.

The following is a list of features that are supported in each of the
architectures:

**Client Connect Failover**
