Failover Manager (EFM) is a high-availability module from EnterpriseDB that enables a Postgres primary node (or agent) to automatically failover to a standby node in the event of a software or hardware failure on the primary.

Traditionally, a cluster is a single instance of Postgres managing multiple databases. In this documentation, the term cluster refers to a Failover Manager cluster. A Failover Manager cluster consists of the following nodes (or agents) that reside on servers in a cloud, or on a traditional network, and communicate using the JGroups toolkit.

-   A primary node - The primary node is the primary database server that is servicing database clients.
-   One or more standby nodes - A standby node is a streaming replication server associated with the primary node.
-   A witness node - The witness node confirms assertions of either the primary or a standby in a failover scenario. A cluster doesn't need a dedicated witness node if the cluster contains three or more nodes. If you don't have a third cluster member that is a database host, you can add a dedicated witness node. A cluster can include more than one witness node.



![A Failover Manager scenario employing a virtual IP address](images/failover_manager_overview.png)

When a non-witness agent starts, it connects to the local database and checks the state of the database:

-   If the agent can't reach the database, it starts in idle mode.
-   If it finds that the database is in recovery, the agent assumes the role of standby.
-   If the database isn't in recovery, the agent assumes the role of primary.

In the event of a failover, Failover Manager attempts to ensure that the promoted standby is the most up-to-date standby in the cluster. Data loss is possible if the standby node is not in sync with the primary node.

[JGroups](http://www.jgroups.org/) provides technology that allows Failover Manager to create clusters whose member nodes can communicate with each other and detect node failures.

The figure illustrates a Failover Manager cluster that uses a virtual IP address. You can use a load balancer in place of a [virtual IP address](04_configuring_efm/05_using_vip_addresses/#using_vip_addresses) if you provide your own [script](04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#cluster_properties) to reconfigure the load balancer whenever databases are added or removed. You can also choose to enable native EFM-Pgpool integration for high availability.
