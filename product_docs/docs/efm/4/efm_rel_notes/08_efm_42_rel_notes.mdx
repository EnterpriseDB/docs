title: "Version 4.2"
---

Enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in EFM 4.2 include:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Enhancement | A new Eager Failover setup was added to move primary resources from an unmonitored and unhealthy node to a fully operational and healthy node. With this setup, a failover is exercised when the primary EFM agent is stopped. Without Eager Failover, the primary Postgres instance would be left available, but unmanaged. |
| Enhancement | The EDB Postgres High Availability and Horizontal Read Scaling Architecture is certified with PgPool-II 4.2 and is supported with non-sudo mode. |
| Enhancement | Promotion priority for standbys can now be defined per primary. [Support Ticket #1092697]
| Enhancement | The stop-cluster command can now be disabled in EFM configuration. |
| Bug Fix | Standbys configured with archiving are now properly reconfigured to follow the new primary. [Support Ticket #1127627, #1182654]
| Bug Fix | A new option can disable the LoadBalancer detach script, when the primary EFM agent fails, but Postgres is still running. [Support Ticket #1096007]

See [The Cluster Properties File](../efm_user/04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties) for more information on the new properties.
