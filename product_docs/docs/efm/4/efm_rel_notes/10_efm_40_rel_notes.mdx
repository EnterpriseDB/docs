title: "Version 4.0"
---

Enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in EFM 4.0 include:

| Type | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Enhancement | Properties have been renamed. See the table below for details. If you use the upgrade utility to upgrade your Failover Manager installation, they are automatically updated. |
| Enhancement | The property value for the encrypted database password needs to be updated to meet the new hashing algorithm. The upgrade tool will make the required changes. When creating the properties file manually, the standard procedure for encrypting the password can be used instead. |
| Enhancement | Encryption for database password has been improved. Encryption has also been enabled for communication between the agents. |
| Enhancement | Standby servers are no longer stopped while selecting the new primary. This enhancement significantly speeds up the promotion process.
| Enhancement | To be consistent with community naming guidelines, the term Master has been replaced with Primary in the Failover Manager product and documentation. The upgrade-conf tool will handle the task of renaming the impacted properties post-upgrade. The load balancer scripts such as script.load.balancer.attach, script.load. balancer.detach will now accept character p instead of character m as an argument.
| Enhancement | Support has been added to delay the restart of standbys after a promotion. You can increase the availability by staggering the restart of standbys.
| Bug Fix | Documentation has been updated to aid users who use tmpfs mount points for /var/run and /var/lock [Support Ticket #977437]
| Bug Fix | An IDLE agent will attempt to resume monitoring when other agents are able to reach its database. [Support Ticket #1001533] |
