title: "Version 4.8"
---

Enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in EFM 4.8 include:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Enhancement | The minimum Java version required to run Failover Manager is now version 11 instead of 8. |
| Enhancement | The minimum database server version now supported is 11.  |
| Enhancement | New CLI command 'efm reset-members added' to remove cached node addreses after a node is removed from a cluster. [Support ticket: #1047118]|
| Enhancement | Encryption/decryption of database password will now work in a FIPS environment. [Support ticket: #90803, #90805] |
| Enhancement | Changed the order to retrieve WAL replay/receive queries from a standby during a cluster status call. This can help avoid confusing output when the database cluster is under load. |
| Enhancement | Failover Manager will now log more information about outside processes attempting to connect to a running agent's address/port. |
| Enhancement | Failover Manager has been upgraded to use PostgreSQL JDBC Driver version 42.6.0. |
| Enhancement | Failover Manager agents can be started before the local database has been initialized. |
| Enhancement | Failover Manager will warn the user and not start if the ping.server.ip property has been set to the virtual IP address. Setting these to the same value will break network connectivity checks when the VIP is dropped during a switchover. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an edge case that could result in two primary nodes in the case of an even split of a cluster (e.g. between two data centers with equal number of nodes). |
| Bug Fix | During a cluster shutdown, the coordinator will wait a couple seconds before exiting to prevent edge cases of other nodes logging warnings about cluster communication problems. [Support ticket #96840]|
| Bug Fix | Fixed a rare timing case that could result in a primary database failure being ignored because of a simultaneous cluster status check. [Support ticket: #98428] |
