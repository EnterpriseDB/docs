title: Installing Failover Manager on SLES 15 ppc64le

To complete an installation:

- [Setting up the repository](#setting-up-the-repository)
- [Installing the package](#installing-the-package)
- [Initial configuration](#initial-configuration)

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

Before setting up the repository, you need to register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

## Setting up the repository

Setting up the repository is a one time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform these steps.

```shell
# Install the repository configuration and enter your EDB repository
# credentials when prompted
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access
# to SUSE repositories
zypper install SUSEConnect

# The following set of commands are designed to let you copy and paste
# them into a terminal window. The printf commands prompt you to enter
# registration information interactively. Alternatively, for a
# non-interactive approach, you can remove the printf commands
# commands and replace $SUSE_REGISTRATION_CODE and $SUSE_EMAIL
# with your registration information.

# Store your SUSE registration information
printf "Enter SUSE subscription registration code: " && read -r SUSE_REGISTRATION_CODE
printf "Enter SUSE subscription email: " && read -r SUSE_EMAIL

# Register the host with SUSE using your stored information,
# which allows access to SUSE repositories.
SUSEConnect -r $SUSE_REGISTRATION_CODE -e $SUSE_EMAIL

# Activate the required SUSE module
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.3/ppc64le

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh
```

## Installing the package

```shell
zypper -n install edb-efm<4x>
```

Where `<4x>` is the version of Failover Manager you are installing. For example, if you are installing version 4.0, the package name would be `edb-efm40`.

## Initial configuration

If you are using Failover Manager to monitor a cluster owned by a user other than enterprisedb or postgres, see [Extending Failover Manager permissions](../04_configuring_efm/04_extending_efm_permissions/#extending_efm_permissions).

After installing on each node of the cluster:

1.  Modify the [cluster properties file](../04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#cluster_properties) on each node.
2.  Modify the [cluster members file](../04_configuring_efm/03_cluster_members/#cluster_members) on each node.
3.  If applicable, configure and test virtual IP address settings and any scripts that are identified in the cluster properties file.
4.  Start the agent on each node of the cluster. For more information, see [Controlling the Failover Manager service](../08_controlling_efm_service/#controlling-the-failover-manager-service).
