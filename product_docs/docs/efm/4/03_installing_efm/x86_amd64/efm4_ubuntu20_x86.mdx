title: Installing Failover Manager on Ubuntu 20.04 x86_64
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on the same host. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux).

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

## Install the package

```shell
sudo apt-get install edb-efm<4x>
```

Where `<4x>` is the version of Failover Manager that you are installing. For example, if you are installing version 4.0, the package name would be `edb-efm40`.

The installation process creates a user named efm that has privileges to invoke scripts that control the Failover Manager service for clusters owned by enterprisedb or postgres.

## Initial configuration

If you are using Failover Manager to monitor a cluster owned by a user other than enterprisedb or postgres, see [Extending Failover Manager permissions](../../04_configuring_efm/04_extending_efm_permissions/#extending_efm_permissions).

After installing on each node of the cluster:

1.  Modify the [cluster properties file](../../04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#cluster_properties) on each node.
2.  Modify the [cluster members file](../../04_configuring_efm/03_cluster_members/#cluster_members) on each node.
3.  If applicable, configure and test virtual IP address settings and any scripts that are identified in the cluster properties file.
4.  Start the agent on each node of the cluster. For more information, see [Controlling the Failover Manager service](../../08_controlling_efm_service/#controlling-the-failover-manager-service).
