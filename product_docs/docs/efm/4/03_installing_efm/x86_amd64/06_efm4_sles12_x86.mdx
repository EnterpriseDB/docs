To install Failover Manager, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, see the instructions to [access EDB software repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

You can use the `zypper` package manager to install a Failover Manager agent on an SLES 12 host. `zypper` attempts to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package but requires access to specific repositories that are not hosted at EnterpriseDB.

## Installing

1.  Assume superuser privileges and stop any firewalls before installing Failover Manager. Then, use the following commands to add EnterpriseDB repositories to your system:

    ```text
    zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo
    ```

2.  The commands create the repository configuration files in the `/etc/zypp/repos.d` directory. Use the following command to refresh the metadata on your SLES host to include the EnterpriseDB repository:

    ```text
    zypper refresh
    ```

    When prompted, provide credentials for the repository, specify to always trust the provided key, and update the metadata to include the EnterpriseDB repository.

3.  Add SUSEConnect and the SUSE Package Hub extension to the SLES host and register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories:

    ```text
    zypper install SUSEConnect
    SUSEConnect -r <registration_number> -e <user_id>
    SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.4/x86_64
    SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.4/x86_64
    ```

4.  Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories:

    ```text
    zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache:/Modules/SLE_12_SP4/Apache:Modules.repo
    ```

5.  Install OpenJDK (version 1.8) for Java-based components:

    ```text
    zypper -n install java-1_8_0-openjdk
    ```

6.  Use the `zypper` utility to install a Failover Manager agent:

    ```text
    zypper -n install edb-efm<4x>
    ```

    Where <4x> is the version of Failover Manager you are installing.
