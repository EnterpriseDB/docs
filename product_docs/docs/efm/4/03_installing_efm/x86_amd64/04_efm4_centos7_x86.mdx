To request credentials that allow you to access an EnterpriseDB repository, see the [EDB Repository Access instructions](https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf).

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that isn't recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press **Return** to continue.

During the installation, yum might encounter a dependency that it can't resolve. If it does, it provides a list of the required dependencies to manually resolve.

Failover Manager must be installed by root. During the installation process, the installer also creates a user named efm that has privileges to invoke scripts that control the Failover Manager service for clusters owned by enterprisedb or postgres.

After receiving your credentials, you must create the EnterpriseDB repository configuration file on each node of the cluster and then modify the file to enable access. 


## Installing

1.  To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

2.  Replace ‘USERNAME:PASSWORD’ with your username and password for the EDB repositories:

    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

3.  Install the EPEL repository:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

5.  Install the selected package:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-efm42
    ```

## Initial configuration

If you are using Failover Manager to monitor a cluster owned by a user other than enterprisedb or postgres, see [Extending Failover Manager permissions](../../04_configuring_efm/04_extending_efm_permissions/#extending_efm_permissions).

After installing on each node of the cluster:

1.  Modify the [cluster properties file](../../04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#cluster_properties) on each node.
2.  Modify the [cluster members file](../../04_configuring_efm/03_cluster_members/#cluster_members) on each node.
3.  If applicable, configure and test virtual IP address settings and any scripts that are identified in the cluster properties file.
4.  Start the agent on each node of the cluster. For more information, see [Controlling the Failover Manager service](../../08_controlling_efm_service/#controlling-the-failover-manager-service).
