## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install Postgres on the same host (not needed for witness nodes).

  - See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/installing/)

  - See [PostgreSQL Downloads](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

- Set up the EDB repository.

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

  To determine if your repository exists, enter this command:

  `zypper lr -E | grep enterprisedb`

  If no output is generated, the repository isn't installed.

  To set up the EDB repository:

  1. Go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).

  1. Select the button that provides access to the EDB repository.
  1. Select the platform and software that you want to download.

  1. Follow the instructions for setting up the EDB repository.

- Activate the required SUSE module:
  ```shell
  sudo SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/x86_64
  sudo SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/x86_64

  ```
- Refresh the metadata:
  ```shell
  sudo zypper refresh
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo zypper -n install edb-efm<4x>
```

Where `<4x>` is the version of Failover Manager that you're installing. For example, if you're installing version 4.10, the package name is `edb-efm410`.

The installation process creates a user named efm that has privileges to invoke scripts that control the Failover Manager service for clusters owned by enterprisedb or postgres.

## Initial configuration

If you're using Failover Manager to monitor a cluster owned by a user other than enterprisedb or postgres, see [Extending Failover Manager permissions](../../04_configuring_efm/04_extending_efm_permissions/#extending_efm_permissions).

After installing on each node of the cluster:

1.  Modify the [cluster properties file](../../04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#cluster_properties) on each node.
2.  Modify the [cluster members file](../../04_configuring_efm/03_cluster_members/#cluster_members) on each node.
3.  If applicable, configure and test virtual IP address settings and any scripts that are identified in the cluster properties file.
4.  Start the agent on each node of the cluster. For more information, see [Controlling the Failover Manager service](../../08_controlling_efm_service/).
