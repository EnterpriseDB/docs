## Authorization file not found. Is the local agent running?

If you invoke an Failover Manager cluster management command and Failover Manager isn't running on the node, the `efm` command displays an error:

```text
Authorization file not found. Is the local agent running?
```

## Not authorized to run this command. User '&lt;os user&gt;' is not a member of the \`efm\` group.

You must have special privileges to invoke some of the `efm` commands documented in [Using the efm utility](07_using_efm_utility/#using_efm_utility). If these commands are invoked by a user who isn't authorized to run them, the `efm` command displays an error:

```text
Not authorized to run this command. User '<os user>' is not a member of the `efm` group.
```

## Notification; Unexpected error message

If you receive a notification message about an unexpected error message, check the [Failover Manager log file](09_controlling_logging/#controlling_logging) for an `OutOfMemory` message. Failover Manager runs with the default memory value set by this property:

```text
# Extra information that will be passed to the JVM when starting the agent.
jvm.options=-Xmx128m
```

If you're running with less than 128 megabytes allocated, increase the value and restart the Failover Manager agent.

## Confirming the OpenJDK version

Failover Manager is tested with OpenJDK. We strongly recommend using OpenJDK. You can use the following command to check the type of your Java installation:

```shell
# java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_191"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_191-b12)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.191-b12, mixed mode)
```
!!! Note
    There's a temporary issue with OpenJDK version 11 on RHEL and its derivatives. When starting Failover Manager, you might see an error like the following:

    `java.lang.Error: java.io.FileNotFoundException: /usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-11.0.20.0.8-2.el8.x86_64/lib/tzdb.dat (No such file or directory)`

    If you see this message, the workaround is to manually install the missing package using the command `sudo dnf install tzdata-java`.
