**Authorization file not found. Is the local agent running?**

If you invoke an EFM cluster management command and EFM is not running on the node, the `efm` command will display an error:

```text
Authorization file not found. Is the local agent running?
```

**Not authorized to run this command. User '&lt;os user>' is not a member of the \`efm\` group.**

You must have special privileges to invoke some of the `efm` commands documented in [Using the efm Utility](07_using_efm_utility/#using_efm_utility). If these commands are invoked by a user who isn't authorized to run them, the `efm` command will display an error:

```text
Not authorized to run this command. User '<os user>' is not a member of the `efm` group.
```

**Notification; Unexpected error message**

If you receive a notification message about an unexpected error message, check the [Failover Manager log file](09_controlling_logging/#controlling_logging) for an `OutOfMemory` message. Failover Manager runs with the default memory value set by this property:

```text
# Extra information that will be passed to the JVM when starting the agent.
jvm.options=-Xmx128m
```

If you are running with less than 128 megabytes allocated, you should increase the value and restart the Failover Manager agent.

**Confirming the OpenJDK version**

Failover Manager is tested with OpenJDK; we strongly recommend using OpenJDK. You can use the following command to check the type of your Java installation:

```text
# java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_191"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_191-b12)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.191-b12, mixed mode)
```
