Before configuring a Failover Manager cluster, you must satisfy the prerequisites described below.

**Install Java 1.8 (or later)**

Before using Failover Manager, you must first install Java (version 1.8 or later). Failover Manager is tested with OpenJDK, and we strongly recommend installing that version of Java. [Installation instructions for Java](https://openjdk.java.net/install/) are platform specific.

**Provide an SMTP Server**

You can receive notifications from Failover Manager as specified by a user-defined notification script, by email, or both.

-   If you are using email notifications, an SMTP server must be running on each node of the Failover Manager scenario.
-   If you provide a value in the script.notification property, you can leave the user.email field blank; an SMTP server is not required.

If an event occurs, Failover Manager invokes the script (if provided), and can also send a notification email to any email addresses specified in the user.email parameter of the cluster properties file. For more information about using an SMTP server, visit:

[https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation](https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Deployment_Guide/s1-email-mta.html)

**Configure Streaming Replication**

Failover Manager requires that PostgreSQL streaming replication be configured between the Primary node and the Standby node or nodes. Failover Manager does not support other types of replication.

On database versions 11 (or prior), unless specified with the `-sourcenode` option, a `recovery.conf` file is copied from a random standby node to the stopped primary during switchover. You should ensure that the paths within the `recovery.conf` file on your standby nodes are consistent before performing a switchover. For more information about the `-sourcenode` option, please see [Promoting a Failover Manager Node](../05_using_efm/#promote_node).

On database version 12 or later, the `primary_conninfo` and `restore_command` properties are copied from a random standby node to the stopped primary during switchover (unless otherwise specified with the `-sourcenode` option).

**Modify the pg_hba.conf File**

You must modify the `pg_hba.conf` file on the Primary and Standby nodes, adding entries that allow communication between the all of the nodes in the cluster. The following example demonstrates entries that might be made to the pg_hba.conf file on the Primary node:

```text
# access for itself
host fmdb efm 127.0.0.1/32 md5
# access for standby
host fmdb efm 192.168.27.1/32 md5
# access for witness
host fmdb efm 192.168.27.34/32 md5
```

Where:

 `efm` specifies the name of a valid database user.

 `fmdb` specifies the name of a database to which the efm user may connect.

By default, the `pg_hba.conf` file resides in the `data` directory, under your Postgres installation. After modifying the `pg_hba.conf` file, you must reload the configuration file on each node for the changes to take effect. You can use the following command:

 `# systemctl reload edb-as-x`

Where `x` specifies the Postgres version.

**Using Autostart for the Database Servers**

If a Primary node reboots, Failover Manager may detect the database is down on the Primary node and promote a Standby node to the role of Primary. If this happens, the Failover Manager agent on the (rebooted) Primary node will not get a chance to write the `recovery.conf` file; the `recovery.conf` file prevents the database server from starting. If this happens, the rebooted Primary node will return to the cluster as a second Primary node.

To prevent this, ensure that the Failover Manager agent auto starts before the database server. The agent will start in idle mode, and check to see if there is already a primary in the cluster. If there is a primary node, the agent will verify that a `recovery.conf` or `standby.signal` file exists, and the database will not start as a second primary.

**Ensure Communication Through Firewalls**

If a Linux firewall (i.e. iptables) is enabled on the host of a Failover Manager node, you may need to add rules to the firewall configuration that allow tcp communication between the Failover Manager processes in the cluster. For example:

```text
# iptables -I INPUT -p tcp --dport 7800 -j ACCEPT
/sbin/service iptables save
```

The command shown above opens the port 7800. Failover Manager will connect via the port that corresponds to the port specified in the cluster properties file.

**Ensure that the Database user has Sufficient Privileges**

The database user specified by the `db.user` property in the `efm.properties` file must have sufficient privileges to invoke the following functions on behalf of Failover Manager:

 `pg_current_wal_lsn()`

 `pg_last_wal_replay_lsn()`

 `pg_wal_replay_resume()`

 `pg_wal_replay_pause()`


If the `reconfigure.num.sync` or `reconfigure.sync.primary` property is set to `true`, then:

- For database version 9.6, the `db.user` needs to be a superuser.

- For database versions higher than version 9.6, the `db.user` requires `pg_read_all_stats` privilege and permissions to run `pg_reload_conf()`.

For detailed information about each of these functions, please see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/index.html).

The user must also have permissions to read the values of configuration variables; a database superuser can use the PostgreSQL `GRANT` command to provide the permissions needed:

```text
GRANT pg_read_all_settings TO user_name;
```

For more information about `pg_read_all_settings`, please see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/default-roles.html).
