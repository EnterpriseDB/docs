title: "Failover Manager"

Failover Manager is a high-availability module that monitors the health
of a Postgres streaming replication cluster and verifies failures
quickly. When a database failure occurs, Failover Manager can
automatically promote a streaming replication Standby node into a
writable Primary node to ensure continued performance and protect
against data loss with minimal service interruption.

A Failover Manager cluster is comprised of Failover Manager processes
that reside on the following hosts on a network:

-   A Primary node is the Primary database server that is servicing
    database clients.

-   One or more Standby nodes are streaming replication servers
    associated with the Primary node.

-   The Witness node confirms assertions of either the Primary or a
    Standby in a failover scenario. If during a failure situation, the
    Primary finds itself in a partition with half or more of the nodes,
    it will stay Primary. As such, Failover Manager supports running in
    a cluster with an even number of agents.
