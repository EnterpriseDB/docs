For ensuring the high availability of your database, you can use the
core features of Failover Manager, or you can use Failover Manager along
with Postgres connection libraries (client connect failover) or
connection poolers.

With the capabilities of Failover Manager, EDB has designed four basic
architectures to run a High availability environment:

1. [Failover Manager using VIP (virtual IP)](03_efm_vip): Failover Manager has a key
capability to manage VIP addresses out of the box. VIP addresses
allow applications to connect to a single IP address, which is being
routed to the Primary database server. This architecture is the most
basic solution to run if VIP addresses are available in your
environment.

2. [Failover Manager using client connect failover](04_efm_client_connect_failover):
PostgreSQL client libraries like libpq and jdbc allow for Client
Connection Failover. With Client Connection failover, the connection
string will contain multiple servers (host=srv1,srv2), and the
client library will loop over the available hosts to find a
connection that is available and capable of Read/Write operations.
This capability allows clients to follow the master during a
switchover. This solution does not rely on Virtual IP addresses and
can be used in every environment where such client configurations
can be set.

3. [Failover Manager with PgBouncer](05_efm_pgbouncer): PgBouncer
is used as a proxy between the Client and the Postgres Database
Server and adds a lot of capabilities such as connection pooling and
the option to halt traffic. By leveraging integration options in
Failover Manager to run reconfiguration of PgBouncer during a
Failover, PgBouncer can be used to route the traffic to the correct
primary database server.

4. [Failover Manager with Pgpool](06_efm_pgpool): Pgpool-II is
another tool that is used as a proxy between the Client and the
Postgres Database Server. Pgpool-II adds a lot of capabilities such
as running in cluster mode with a Watchdog, managing VIP\'s, and
Read-Only scalability. Failover Manager has native capabilities to
integrate with Pgpool-II to redirect traffic to another primary
during Database failover overations.

The following is a list of features that are supported in each of the
architectures:

**Client Connect Failover**
