title: "Configuration for Number of Connections and Pooling"
---

Pgpool has some configuration to tune the pooling and connection processing. Depending on this configuration, also the Postgres configuration for `max_connections` should be set to make sure all connections can be accepted as required. Furthermore, note that the Cloud Architecture works with active/active instances, which requires to spread `num_init_children` over all Pgpool instances (divide the normally used value by the number of active instances). The below text describes the effect of changing the configuration, and advises values for both the on-premise and the Cloud architecture.

**max_pool**: Generally, it is advised to set `max_pool` to 1. Alternatively, for applications with a lot of reconnects, `max_pool` can be set to the number of distinct combinations of users, databases and connection options for the application connections. All but one connection in the pool would be stale connections, which consumes a connection slot from Postgres, without adding to performance. It is therefore advised not to configure `max_pool` beyond 4 to preserve a healthy ratio between active and stale connections. As an example, for an application which constantly reconnects and uses 2 distinct users both connecting to their own database, set it to 2. If both users would be able to connect to both databases set it to 4. Note that increasing `max_pool` requires to tune down `num_init_children` in Pgpool, or tune up `max_connections` in Postgres.

**num_init_children**: It is advised to set `num_init_children` to the number of connections that could be running active in parallel, but the value should be divided by the number of active Pgpool-II instances (one with the on-premise architecture, and all instances for the cloud architecture). As an example: In an architecture with 3 Pgpool instances, to allow the application to have 100 active connections in parallel, set `num_init_children` to 100 for the on-premise architecture, and set `num_init_children` to 33 for the cloud architecture. Note that increasing `num_init_children` generally requires to tune up `max_connections` in Postgres.

**listen_backlog_multiplier**: Can be set to multiply the number of open connections (as perceived by the application) with the number of active connections (`num_init_children`). As an example, when the application might open 500 connections of which 100 should be active in parallel, with the on-premise architecture, `num_init_children` should be set to 100, and `listen_backlog_multiplier` should be set to 4. This setup can process 100 connections active in parallel, and another 400 (`listen_backlog_multiplier*num_init_children`) connections will be queued before connections will be blocked. The application would perceive a total of 500 open connections, and Postgres would process the load of 100 connections maximum at all times. Note that increasing `listen_backlog_multiplier` only causes the application to perceive more connections, but will not increase the number of parallel active connections (which is determined by `num_init_children`).

**max_connections**: It is advised to set `max_connections` in Postgres higher than `[number of active pgpool instances]*[max_pool]*[num_init_children] + [superuser_reserved_connections] (Postgres)`. As an example: in the on-premise setup with 3 instances active/passive, `max_pool` set to 2, `num_init_children` set to 100, and `superuser_reserved_connections (Postgres)` set to 5, Postgres `max_connections` should be set equal or higher then `[1*2*100+5]` which is 205 connections or higher. A similar setup in the cloud setup would run with 3 active instances, `max_pool` set to 2, `num_init_children` set to 33, and `superuser_reserved_connections (Postgres)` set to 5, in which case Postgres `max_connections` should be set equal or higher than `[3*2*33+5]` which is 203 or higher. Note that configuring below the advised setting can cause issues opening new connections, and in a combination with `max_pool` can cause unexpected behaviour (low or no active connections but still connection issues due to stale pooled connections using connection slots from Postgres. For more information on the relation between `num_init_children`, `max_pool` and `max_connections`, see this background information.
