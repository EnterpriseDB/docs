title: "Failover Manager with PgBouncer"
---

You can use Failover Manager and PgBouncer to provide high availability
in an on-premises setup as well as a cloud setup. PgBouncer is a popular
connection pooler, but it is not enough to achieve PostgreSQL High
Availability by itself as it doesn't have multi-host configuration,
failover, or detection.




Failover Manager with PgBouncer On-premises
--------------------------------------------

For an on-premises setup, use the connection libraries to provide high
availability by using a connection string with multiple hosts.

Failover Manager with PgBouncer in Cloud
----------------------------------------

For a cloud setup, use a NLB (Network Load Balancer) to balance the traffic on both instances of PgBouncer.

<div style="text-align: center">Figure 4: Failover Manager's traffic routing using PgBouncer in cloud</div>

Note that for multiple reasons EDB does not support this architecture
with PgBouncer and Failover Manager/PostgreSQL running on the same
machines:

-   A restriction with Cloud Network Load Balancers [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-troubleshoot-backend-traffic#cause-4-accessing-the-internal-load-balancer-frontend-from-the-participating-load-balancer-backend-pool-vm)
    does not route traffic properly when source and destination reside
    on the same machines.

-   In mixed architecture, traffic between PgBouncer and Postgres could
    become unbalanced (sometimes local, sometimes networked).

-   PgBouncer and PostgreSQL compete for resources.

-   A master failure would impact both routing (PgBouncer) and Database
    when these two components are combined on the same machines.


Using Failover Manager with PgBouncer
-------------------------------------

### Installing

Install and configure Advanced Server database, Failover Manager, and PgBouncer on AWS Virtual Machines as following:

 
   Systems            | Components
  --------------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  PgDB srv 1, 2, 3    | Primary / standby node running Advanced Server 13 and Failover Manager 4.2
  PgBouncer srv 1, 2  | PgBouncer node running PgBouncer 1.15. These 2 nodes should be registered as targets in the Target Group. Note that there could be more, but 2 is the minimum, and is sufficient for most cases.
  

### Configuring Failover Manager

Use the instructions provided in the *[EFM documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/efm/latest/efm_user/)*
to configure Failover Manager. Perform the following steps in addition
to those instructions:

1. Create an integration script that connects to every (remote)
PgBouncer host and runs the redirect script. The script should be
located at `/usr/edb/efm-4.2/bin/efm_pgbouncer_functions`, should be
executable by the `efm` user, and should have the following contents:

``` text

    #!/bin/bash
    set -e
    IFS=', ' read -r -a PGB_HOSTS <<< "$3"
    FAILED_PGB_HOST=''
    for PGB_HOST in "${PGB_HOSTS[@]}"; do
    echo "redirecting to '$2' on enterprisedb@${PGB_HOST}"
    ssh "enterprisedb@${PGB_HOST}" /usr/edb/pgbouncer1.15/bin/redirect.sh "$2" || FAILED_PGB_HOST="$FAILED_PGB_HOST $PGB_HOST" < /dev/null
    done

    # return exit code to inform EFM agent about failure. The agent would send a failure
    # notification accordingly for manual intervention
    if [ ! -z "$FAILED_PGB_HOST" ]; then
	    echo "Failed to redirect to '$2' on '$FAILED_PGB_HOST'"
	    exit 1
    fi

```

2. Set script.load.balancer.attach to the custom script in the `efm` properties file:

``` text
    script.load.balancer.attach=/usr/edb/efm-4.2/bin/efm_pgbouncer_functions attach %h <pgbs1>,<pgbs2>
```
Where `<pgbs1>` is the hostname or IP address for PgBouncer server 1, and `<pgbs2>` is the hostname or IP address for PgBouncer server 2.

### Configuring PostgreSQL

During normal operation, traffic is balanced across both PgBouncer instances, and both will open connections to PostgreSQL. Therefore make sure that in PostgreSQL the max_connections parameter is compensated to accept enough connections from both instances.

### Configuring PgBouncer

You can use the instructions provided in the [PgBouncer documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgbouncer/latest/02_configuration_and_usage/)
to configure PgBouncer. Perform the following steps in addition to those instructions:

1.  Append the following line to the edb-pgbouncer-1.15.ini file:

``` text

    %include /etc/edb/pgbouncer1.15/edb-pgbouncer-databases.ini
```
2.  In the edb-pgbouncer-1.15.ini file, set the value of `listen_addr` to *:
``` text

    listen_addr = *
```
3.  Leave the [databases] section empty in the `edb-pgbouncer-1.15.ini` file, and configure this section in a separate file
    `/etc/edb/pgbouncer1.15/edb-pgbouncer-databases.ini`. Ensure that this extra config file is readable and writable by enterprisedb.

 The following is an example of the bash commands to create the file:

``` text

    echo "[databases]" > /etc/edb/pgbouncer1.15/edb-pgbouncer-databases.ini
    echo "edb= host=srv1" >> /etc/edb/pgbouncer1.15/edb-pgbouncer-databases.ini
    chown enterprisedb: /etc/edb/pgbouncer1.15/edb-pgbouncer-databases.ini
```

4: Create a script `/usr/edb/pgbouncer1.15/bin/redirect.sh` that can be
used to reconfigure the databases chapter and reload pgbouncer. The
script should be owned by `root`, and be readable/executable by
user/group/other (0755). The script should have the following content:


``` text 
    #!/bin/bash
    set -e

    #Some defaults
    PGBOUNCER_DATABASE_INI=/etc/edb/pgbouncer1.15/edb-pgbouncer-databases.ini

    PGMSTR=${1:-localhost}

    # enterprisedb user does not have permissions to write in folder directly, so `sed -i` will not work
    TMPFILE=$(mktemp)
    sed "s/host=[A-Za-z0-9.]*/host=${PGMSTR}/" "${PGBOUNCER_DATABASE_INI}" > "${TMPFILE}"
    if ! diff -q "${PGBOUNCER_DATABASE_INI}" "${TMPFILE}" >/dev/null; then
        cat "${TMPFILE}" > "${PGBOUNCER_DATABASE_INI}"
        pkill -SIGHUP pgbouncer
    fi
```

### Configuring passwordless ssh

For the PgBouncer integration, passwordless `ssh` access is required. There are multiple ways to configure `ssh`. We recommend that you follow your organization's recommended process to configure the passwordless `ssh`. For a quick start, you can also follow this example for configuring passwordless `ssh`.


#### Configuring on PgBouncer hosts

1.  On every PgBouncer host, temporarily set a password for the enterprisedb user. As root, run `passwd enterprisedb` and enter
    the temporary password twice.

2.  Make sure that Passwordless `ssh` is enabled. You can check with the following command:
    ``` text 
        grep ^PasswordAuthentication /etc/ssh/sshd_config
    ```
    
    Make sure it is set to `yes`. If needed, change and restart `ssh`.

#### Configuring on Failover Manager/PostgreSQL hosts

On every Failover Manager/postgres host, as the efm user:

1.  Run the following command:
    ``` text 
        ssh-keygen -P "" -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa
    ```
2.  For every PgBouncer host, copy the `ssh` key with the following command:
    ``` text 
        ssh-copy-id enterprisedb@<pgbouncerhost>
    ```
 Note that the default home directory for the `enterprisedb` user is  `/var/lib/edb`. If this directory is not already present, create the
 directory manually. As a `sudo` user, run the following commands on each PgBouncer host:
    ``` text 
        mkdir -p /var/lib/edb
        chown -R enterprisedb:enterprisedb /var/lib/edb
    ```

#### Resetting temporary passwords on PgBouncer hosts

You can reset the temporary password for the enterprisedb user on every
PgBouncer host by running the following command as `root`:
``` text
    passwd -d enterprisedb
```
### Configuring the Network Load Balancer

For the Failover Manager PgBouncer integration using Network Load Balancer in AWS or Azure, you need to perform additional steps.

Add the following rules to the security groups to be used by the PgBouncer and database instances.

<div id="sg_rules_pgbouncer" class="registered_link"></div>

-   Rules for the security group to be used by the PgBouncer instances
    (SG PgBouncer).

 
    Type      | Protocol      |   Port range   |   Source       |   Description
  ------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------
  Custom TCP  | TCP           | 6432           |  Entire Subnet |  PgBouncer
  Custom TCP  |  TCP          |   22           |  Entire Subnet |  ssh
  

 In addition to these rules, add the rules for SSH and Ping as per your
 requirement.

-   Rules for the security group used by the database instances (SG DB):

  
    Type      | Protocol      |   Port range   |   Source       |   Description
  ------------|---------------|----------------|----------------|-------------------
  Custom TCP  | TCP           | 7800           | Entire Subnet  | Failover Manager
  Custom TCP  | TCP           | 5444           | Entire Subnet  |Postgres
  Custom TCP  | TCP           | 22             | Entire Subnet  | ssh
 

 This ensures that the ports required to run the database, Failover Manager, and PgBouncer are open for communication between the nodes
 and the Load Balancer for traffic routing and health monitoring.

 In addition to these rules, add the rules for SSH and Ping as per your requirement.

If you are using Azure, proceed to the following section. If using AWS, see [Configuring NLB in AWS](#config_nlb_aws).

#### Configuring NLB in Azure

After configuring the rules described in [Creating rules for security groups](#sg_rules_pgbouncer), follow the Azure documentation to:

-   Create a Backend pool consisting of the two virtual machines running
    the PgBouncer instances. Use the private IPs of the virtual machines
    to create the Backend pool.

-   Add a health probe to check if the PgBouncer instance is available
    on the virtual machines. Select `Protocol` as `TCP` and `Port`
    as `6432`.

-   Add a Load balancing rule for port `6432`. This rule should ensure
    that the network traffic coming towards that particular port gets
    distributed evenly among all the virtual machines present in the
    Backend pool. Select the `Type` as `Public` Load Balancer or
    `Internal` Load Balancer.

After completing these configurations, you can connect to the database
on the IP address of the Network Load Balancer using port 6432. If a
failure occurs on the Primary database server, Failover Manager will
promote a new Primary and then reconfigure PgBouncer to redistribute
traffic. If any one of the PgBouncer processes is not available to
accept traffic anymore, the Network Load Balancer will redistribute all
the traffic to the remaining PgBouncer processes. Make sure that
`max_client_conn` parameter is tuned to compensate for the higher number
of connections in case of failover.

 
<div id="config_nlb_aws" class="registered_link"></div>

#### Configuring NLB in AWS

The following sample configuration assumes:

-   All the EC2 instances and the Loadbalancer are deployed in the same
    Subnet. Note that if required, the database nodes could be added to
    another Subnet, but that requires a more complex configuration and
    might have a performance impact.

-   There is a security group for PgBouncer and a security group for the
    database instances.

After configuring the rules described in [Creating rules for security groups](#sg_rules_pgbouncer), follow the AWS documentation to

-   Create a target group with the following details:

     Name          | Type           | Protocol       |   Port         |   VPC
    ---------------|----------------|----------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------
    pgbouncer      | Instances      | TCP            |  6432          |  Select the VPC to which the instances are connected.

    Leave the rest of the settings (Health check TCP and Advanced health check settings) as default.

    Register the created Target Groups with the instances that are running PgBouncer.

-   Create a Load Balancer with the following details:

     Type                                                                  | VPC                                           | Listener                                                                              | 
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    `Public` or `Internal`. EDB recommends using an Internal Load Balancer.| Choose a VPC and map it to the desired zones. | Create a listener with `TCP` as `6432`, and forward it to the target group pgbouncer. |


After completing the configurations, you can connect to the database on
the IP address of the Network Load Balancer on port 6432. If a failure
occurs on the Primary database server, Failover Manager promotes a new
Primary and then reconfigures PgBouncer to redistribute traffic. If any
one of the PgBouncer processes is not available to accept traffic
anymore, the Network Load Balancer will redistribute all the traffic to
the remaining PgBouncer processes. Make sure that `max_client_conn`
parameter is tuned to compensate for the higher number of connections in
case of failover.
