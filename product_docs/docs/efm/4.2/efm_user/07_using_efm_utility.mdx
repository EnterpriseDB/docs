title: "Using the efm Utility"
---

<div id="using_efm_utility" class="registered_link"></div>

Failover Manager provides the efm utility to assist with cluster management. The RPM installer adds the utility to the `/usr/edb/efm-4.1/bin` directory when you install Failover Manager.

**efm allow-node**

<div id="efm_allow_node" class="registered_link"></div>

```text
efm allow-node <cluster_name>
```

Invoke the `efm allow-node` command to allow the specified node to join the cluster. When invoking the command, provide the name of the cluster and the IP address of the joining node.

This command must be invoked by `efm`, a member of the `efm` group, or root.

**efm disallow-node**

<div id="efm_disallow_node" class="registered_link"></div>

```text
efm disallow-node <cluster_name> <address>
```

Invoke the `efm disallow-node` command to remove the specified node from the allowed hosts list, and prevent the node from joining a cluster. Provide the name of the cluster and the address of the node when calling the `efm disallow-node` command. This command must be invoked by `efm`, a member of the `efm` group, or root.

**efm cluster-status**

<div id="efm_cluster_status" class="registered_link"></div>

```text
efm cluster-status <cluster_name>
```

Invoke the `efm cluster-status` command to display the status of a Failover Manager cluster. For more information about the status report, see [Monitoring a Failover Manager Cluster](06_monitoring_efm_cluster/#monitoring_efm_cluster).

**efm cluster-status-json**

<div id="efm_cluster_status-json" class="registered_link"></div>

```text
efm cluster-status-json <cluster_name>
```

Invoke the `efm cluster-status-json` command to display the status of a Failover Manager cluster in json format. While the format of the displayed information is different than the display generated by the efm cluster-status command, the information source is the same.

The following example is generated by querying the status of a healthy cluster with three nodes:

```text
{
    "nodes": {
        "172.16.144.176": {
            "type": "Witness",
            "agent": "UP",
            "db": "N\/A",
            "vip": "",
            "vip_active": false
        },
        "172.16.144.177": {
            "type": "Primary",
            "agent": "UP",
            "db": "UP",
            "vip": "",
            "vip_active  :   false"
            "xlogReceive :   0/14001478"
            "xlog    :   0/14001478"
            "xloginfo    :"
        },
        "172.16.144.180": {
            "type": "Standby",
            "agent": "UP",
            "db": "UP",
            "vip": "",
            "vip_active  :   false"
            "xlogReceive :   0/14001478"
            "xlog    :   0/14001478"
            "xloginfo    :"
        }
    },
    "allowednodes": [
        "172.16.144.177",
        "172.16.144.160",
        "172.16.144.180",
        "172.16.144.176"
    ],
    "membershipcoordinator": "172.16.144.177",
    "failoverpriority": [
        "172.16.144.180"
    ],
    "minimumstandbys": 0,
    "missingnodes": [],
    "messages": []
}
```

**efm encrypt**

<div id="efm_encrypt" class="registered_link"></div>

```text
efm encrypt <cluster_name> [--from-env]
```

Invoke the `efm encrypt` command to encrypt the database password before include the password in the cluster properties file. Include the `--from-env` option to instruct Failover Manager to use the value specified in the `EFMPASS` environment variable, and execute without user input. For more information, see [Encrypting Your Database Password](04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/01_encrypting_database_password/#encrypting_database_password).

**efm promote**

<div id="efm_promote" class="registered_link"></div>

```text
efm promote cluster_name [-switchover [-sourcenode <address>][-quiet][-noscripts]
```

The `efm promote` command instructs Failover Manager to perform a manual failover of standby to primary.

Manual promotion should only be attempted if the status command reports that the cluster includes a Standby node that is up-to-date with the Primary. If there is no up-to-date Standby, Failover Manager will prompt you before continuing.

Include the `â€“switchover` clause to promote a standby node, and reconfigure a primary node as a standby node. Include the `-sourcenode` keyword, and specify a node address to indicate the node whose recovery settings will be copied to the old primary node (making it a standby). Include the `-quiet` keyword to suppress notifications during the switchover process. Include the `-noscripts` keyword to instruct Failover Manager to not invoke fencing or post-promotion scripts.

This command must be invoked by `efm`, a member of the `efm` group, or root.

!!! Note
    This command instructs the service to ignore the value specified in the `auto.failover` parameter in the cluster properties file.

**efm resume**

<div id="efm_resume" class="registered_link"></div>

```text
efm resume <cluster_name>
```

Invoke the `efm resume` command to resume monitoring a previously stopped database. This command must be invoked by efm, a member of the efm group, or root.

**efm set-priority**

<div id="efm_set_priority" class="registered_link"></div>

```text
efm set-priority <cluster_name> <address> <priority>
```

Invoke the `efm set-priority` command to assign a failover priority to a standby node. The value specifies the order in which the node will be used in the event of a failover. This command must be invoked by `efm`, a member of the `efm` group, or root.

Use the priority option to specify the place for the node in the priority list. For example, specify a value of 1 to indicate that the node is the primary standby, and will be the first node promoted in the event of a failover. A priority value of 0 instructs Failover Manager to not promote the standby.

**efm stop-cluster**

<div id="efm_stop_cluster" class="registered_link"></div>

```text
efm stop-cluster <cluster_name>
```

Invoke the `efm stop-cluster` command to stop Failover Manager on all nodes. This command instructs Failover Manager to connect to each node on the cluster and instruct the existing members to shut down. The command has no effect on running databases, but when the command completes, there is no failover protection in place.

!!! Note
    When you invoke the `efm stop-cluster` command, all authorized node information is removed from the Allowed node host list.

This command must be invoked by `efm`, a member of the `efm` group, or root.

**efm upgrade-conf**

<div id="efm_upgrade_conf" class="registered_link"></div>

```text
efm upgrade-conf <cluster_name> [-source <directory>]
```

Invoke the `efm upgrade-conf` command to copy the configuration files from an existing Failover Manager installation, and add parameters required by a Failover Manager installation. Provide the name of the previous cluster when invoking the utility. This command must be invoked with root privileges.

If you are upgrading from a Failover Manager configuration that does not use sudo, include the `-source` flag and specify the name of the *directory* in which the configuration files reside when invoking upgrade-conf.

**efm node-status-json**

<div id="efm_node_status_json" class="registered_link"></div>

```text
efm node-status-json <cluster_name>
```

Invoke the `efm node-status-json` command to display the status of a local node in json format. A successful execution of this command returns `0` as its exit code. In case of a database failure or an agent status becoming IDLE, the command returns `1` as exit code.

The following is an example output of the `efm node-status-json` command:

> ```text
> {
>   "type":"Standby",
>   "address":"172.16.144.130",
>   "agent":"UP",
>   "db":"UP",
>   "vip":"",
>   "vip_active":"false"
> }
> ```

**efm --help**

<div id="efm_help" class="registered_link"></div>

```text
efm --help
```

Invoke the `efm --help` command to display online help for the Failover Manager utility commands.
