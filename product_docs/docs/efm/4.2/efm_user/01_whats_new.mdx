The following changes have been made to EDB Postgres Failover Manager to create version 4.2:

-   Support has been added to enable Pgpool EFM integration in a non-sudo mode.
-   Failover Manager now provides an option to specify if you do not want to detach the node from the load balancer in case the primary agent fails but the database is still reachable.
-   Support has been added to define the priority of standbys applicable for a particular primary node.
-   Enhancements have been done to the way standbys are reconfigured so that when archiving is used, standbys will properly follow the new primary.
-   A run mode called Eager Failover has been added to the documentation to allow for failovers in situations where previously the old primary would remain active but unmonitored.
-   An option to disable the stop-cluster command has been added.
