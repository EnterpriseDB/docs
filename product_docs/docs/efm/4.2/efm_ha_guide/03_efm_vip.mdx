Failover Manager provides support for clusters that use a virtual IP (VIP).

Using Failover Manager with VIP
-------------------------------

### Installing

Install and configure the Advanced Server database and Failover Manager
on three servers as following:

  ------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Systems**                                **Components**
  PG Primary, PG Standby1, and PG Standby2   Primary / standby nodes running Advanced Server 13 and Failover Manager 4.2
  ------------------------------------------ -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Specifying VIP

In the cluster properties file, provide the hostname or IP address in
the virtual.ip property. Specify the corresponding prefix in the
virtual.ip.prefix property. Use the virtual.ip.interface property to
provide the network interface used by the VIP. By default, the
virtual.ip and virtual.ip.prefix values must be the same across all the
agents.

The specified virtual IP address is assigned only to the primary node of
the cluster. If you specify virtual.ip.single=true, the same VIP address
will be used on the new primary in the event of a failover. Specify a
value of false to provide a unique IP address for each node of the
cluster.

For information about using a virtual IP address, see [Using Failover Manager with Virtual IP Addresses](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/efm/latest/efm_user/04_configuring_efm/05_using_vip_addresses/#using_vip_addresses).
