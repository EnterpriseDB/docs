The following changes have been made to EDB Postgres Failover Manager to create version 3.6:

-   The `db.bin` property is now a required property: this is a change in behavior from prior releases. For more information about the `db.bin` property, see `The Cluster Properties File <cluster_properties>`.
-   The `db.config.dir` property can be used to specify the location of the Postgres configuration files if they are not stored in the same directory as the `recovery.conf` file. For more information about the `db.config.dir` property, see `The Cluster Properties File <cluster_properties>`.
-   The cluster status report now includes additional information about WAL records; you can access information about received and replayed WAL files in the cluster status report. For more information about the cluster status report, see `Monitoring a Failover Manager Cluster <monitoring_efm_cluster>`.
