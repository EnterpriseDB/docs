If you receive a notification message about an unexpected error message, check the `Failover Manager log file <controlling_logging>` for an `OutOfMemory` message. Failover Manager runs with the default memory value set by this property:

```
# Extra information that will be passed to the JVM when starting the agent.
jvm.options=-Xmx128m
```

If you are running with less than 128 megabytes allocated, you should increase the value and restart the Failover Manager agent.

Failover Manager is tested with OpenJDK; we strongly recommend using OpenJDK. You can use the following command to check the type of your Java installation:

```
# java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_191"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_191-b12)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.191-b12, mixed mode)
```
