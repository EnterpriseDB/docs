## Installing an RPM Package on a RedHat, CentOS, or OEL Host

After receiving your credentials, you must create the EnterpriseDB repository configuration file on each node of the cluster, and then modify the file to enable access. The following steps provide detailed information about accessing the EnterpriseDB repository; the steps must be performed on each node of the cluster:

1.  Use the `edb-repo` package to create the repository configuration file. You can download and invoke the edb-repo file, or use rpm or yum to create the repository. Assume superuser privileges and use either rpm or yum to create the EnterpriseDB repository configuration file:

    `rpm -Uvh http://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm` or

    `yum install -y http://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm`

    The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`; it resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

2.  Use your choice of editor to modify the repository configuration file, enabling the `[enterprisedb-tools]` and the `[enterprisedb-dependencies]` entries. To enable a repository, change the value of the `enabled` parameter to `1` and replace the user name and password placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with your user name and the repository password.

<!-- -->

```
[enterprisedb-tools]
name=EnterpriseDB Tools $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=http://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/tools/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
enabled=0
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
[enterprisedb-dependencies]
name=EnterpriseDB Dependencies $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=http://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/dependencies/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
enabled=0
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```

1.  After modifying applicable entries in the repository configuration file, save the configuration file and exit the editor.

Then, you can use the `yum install` command to install Failover Manager. For example, to install Failover Manager version 3.6, use the command:

> `yum install edb-efm36`

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter a `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

Failover Manager must be installed by root. During the installation process, the installer will also create a user named `efm` that has sufficient privileges to invoke scripts that control the Failover Manager service for clusters owned by `enterprisedb` or `postgres`.

If you are using Failover Manager to monitor a cluster owned by a user other than `enterprisedb` or `postgres`, see `Extending Failover Manager Permissions <extending_efm_permissions>` .

After installing Failover Manager on each node of the cluster, you must:

1.  Modify the `cluster properties file <cluster_properties>` on each node.

2.  Modify the `cluster members file <cluster_members>` on each node.

3.  If applicable, configure and test virtual IP address settings and any scripts that are identified in the cluster properties file.

4.  Start the Failover Manager agent on each node of the cluster. For more information about controlling the Failover Manager service, see [Section 5](#controlling-the-failover-manager-service).

### Installation Locations

Failover Manager components are installed in the following locations:

| Component                         | Location                    |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Executables                       | /usr/edb/efm-3.6/bin        |
| Libraries                         | /usr/edb/efm-3.6/lib        |
| Cluster configuration files       | /etc/edb/efm-3.6            |
| Logs                              | /var/log/efm-3.6            |

## Installing an RPM Package on a Debian or Ubuntu Host

To install Failover Manager, you must also have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, visit the EnterpriseDB website at:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request>

Follow the links in the EDB Failover Manager table to request credentials.

The following steps will walk you through using the EnterpriseDB apt repository to install Failover Manager. When using the commands, replace the *username* and *password* with the credentials provided by EnterpriseDB.

1.  Assume superuser privileges:

    `sudo su -`

2.  Configure the EnterpriseDB apt repository:

<!-- -->

```
sh -c 'echo "deb
https://\ *username*:*password*\ @apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release
-cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" >
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
```

1.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

    `apt-get install apt-transport-https`

2.  Add the EDB signing key:

<!-- -->

```
wget -q -O - https:// *username*: *password*
@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key \| apt-key add -
```

1.  Update the repository meta data:

    `apt-get update`

2.  Install Failover Manager:

    `apt-get install edb-efm36`

## Installing an RPM Package on a SLES Host

To install Failover Manager, you must also have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, visit the EnterpriseDB website at:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request>

You can use the zypper package manager to install a Failover Manager agent on an SLES 12 host. zypper will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but requires access to specific repositories that are not hosted at EnterpriseDB.

You must assume superuser privileges and stop any firewalls before installing Failover Manager. Then, use the following commands to add EnterpriseDB repositories to your system:

```
zypper addrepo http://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas96-sles.repo
zypper addrepo http://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas-sles-tools.repo
zypper addrepo http://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas-sles-dependencies.repo
```

The commands create the repository configuration files in the /etc/zypp/repos.d directory. Then, use the following command to refresh the metadata on your SLES host to include the EnterpriseDB repository:

> `zypper refresh`

When prompted, provide credentials for the repository, and specify a to always trust the provided key, and update the metadata to include the EnterpriseDB repository.

You must also add SUSEConnect and the SUSE Package Hub extension to the SLES host, and register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories. Use the commands:

```
zypper install SUSEConnect
SUSEConnect -r *registration_number* -e *user_id*
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12/x86_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12/x86_64
```

Then, you can use the zypper utility to install a Failover Manager agent:

> `zypper install edb-efm36`
