The following changes have been made to EDB Postgres Failover Manager to create version 3.8:

-   You can use the [restore.command](04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#restore_command) property to update the restore\_command parameter if a new master is promoted.
-   You can use the [reconfigure.sync.master](04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#reconfigure_sync_master) property to specify Failover Manager behavior if the number of synchronous standbys drops below the required level.
-   New `notifications <notifications>` will inform you if the state of a synchronous replication master changes, if a recovery file exists on the master node, or if the trigger file path is not writable.
