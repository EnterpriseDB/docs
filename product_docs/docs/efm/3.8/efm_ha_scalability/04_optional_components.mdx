## Virtual IP Addresses

Both Pgpool-II and Failover Manager provide functionality to employ a virtual IP for seamless failover. While both provide this capability, it must be noted that Failover Manager associates a virtual IP to the master database node while Pgpool associates a virtual IP to the currently-active Pgpool host (in a multi-Pgpool watchdog setup).

Note that if an active instance of Pgpool (Server 4 in our sample architecture) goes down, any available standby Pgpool instance (according to watchdog priority) will take charge as the active Pgpool instance.



## Pgpool Watchdog

Watchdog provides high availability for Pgpool nodes. This section lists the configuration parameters required to configure watchdog on each Pgpool node.

**Common Watchdog Configuration Parameters for All Pgpool Nodes**

    use_watchdog = on # enable watchdog
    wd_port = 9000 # watchdog port, can be changed
    delegate_IP = ‘Virtual IP address’
    wd_lifecheck_method = 'heartbeat'
    wd_interval = 10 # we can lower this value for quick detection
    wd_life_point = 3
    # virtual IP control
    if_cmdconfig_path = '/sbin' # ifconfig command path
    if_up_cmd = 'ifconfig eth0:0 inet $_IP_$ netmask 255.255.255.0'
    # startup delegate IP command
    if_down_cmd = 'ifconfig eth0:0 down' #shutdown DIP
    arping_path = '/usr/sbin' # arping command path
    arping_cmd = 'arping -U $_IP_$ -w 1' # arping command

**Custom Watchdog Configuration Parameters for Each Pgpool Node**

The following configuration parameters must be set on each Pgpool node. The interval and retry values can be adjusted depending upon the requirements and testing results.

    other_pgpool_hostname0 = '<server# IP/hostname>'
    other_pgpool_port0 = 9999
    other_wd_port0 = 9000
    other_pgpool_hostname1 = '<server# IP/hostname>'
    other_pgpool_port1 = 9999
    other_wd_port1 = 9000
    wd_priority = <any integer>

Note that `wd_priority` can be used to elevate the local watchdog node priority in the elections to select master watchdog node. The node with the higher `wd_priority` value will get selected as master watchdog node when cluster will be electing its new master node at the time of cluster startup or in the event of old master watchdog node failure.
