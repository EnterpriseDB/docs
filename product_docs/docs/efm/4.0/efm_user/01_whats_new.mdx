The following changes have been made to EDB Postgres Failover Manager to create version 4.0:

-   Encryption for database password has been improved. Encryption has also been enabled for communication between the agents.
-   Standby servers are no longer stopped while selecting the new primary. This enhancement significantly speeds up the promotion process.
-   To be consistent with community naming guidelines, the term Master has been replaced with Primary in the Failover Manager product and documentation. The upgrade-conf tool will handle the task of renaming the impacted properties post-upgrade. The load balancer scripts such as `script.load.balancer.attach`, `script.load. balancer.detach` will now accept character `p` instead of character `m` as an argument.
-   Support has been added to delay the restart of standbys after a promotion. You can increase the availability by staggering the restart of standbys.
-   A primary agent now attempts to resume health monitoring in a situation where the agent can not reach its local database but other agents can.
