## RedHat, CentOS, or OEL Host

After receiving your credentials, you must create the EnterpriseDB repository configuration file on each node of the cluster, and then modify the file to enable access. The following steps provide detailed information about accessing the EnterpriseDB repository; the steps must be performed on each node of the cluster:

1.  To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges, and invoke the following command:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

-   On RHEL or CentOS 8:

    ```
    dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

1.  After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to ensure that the value of the enabled parameter is `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

> ```
> [edb]
> name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
> baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
> enabled=1
> gpgcheck=1
> gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
> ```

1.  After saving your changes to the configuration file, install the EPEL repository:

> ```
> dnf -y install epel-release
> ```

1.  If you are using RHEL or CentOS 8.x, you must enable the PowerTools repository:

> ```
> dnf config-manager --set-enabled PowerTools``
> ```

1.  Now you can use the following command to install Failover Manager:

> -   On RHEL or CentOS 7:
>
> <!-- -->
>
> ```
> yum install edb-efm40
> ```
>
> -   On RHEL or CentOS 8:
>
> <!-- -->
>
> ```
> dnf install edb-efm40
> ```

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

must be installed by root. During the installation process, the installer will also create a user named `efm` that has sufficient privileges to invoke scripts that control the Failover Manager service for clusters owned by `enterprisedb` or `postgres`.

If you are using to monitor a cluster owned by a user other than `enterprisedb` or `postgres`, see `Extending Failover Manager Permissions <extending_efm_permissions>` .

After installing on each node of the cluster, you must:

1.  Modify the `cluster properties file <cluster_properties>` on each node.
2.  Modify the `cluster members file <cluster_members>` on each node.
3.  If applicable, configure and test virtual IP address settings and any scripts that are identified in the cluster properties file.
4.  Start the agent on each node of the cluster. For more information about controlling the service, see [Section 5](08_controlling_efm_service/#controlling-the-failover-manager-service).

### Installation Locations

components are installed in the following locations:

| Component                         | Location                 |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------ |

| Libraries                         | /usr/edb/efm-/lib        |
| Cluster configuration files       | /etc/edb/efm-            |
| Logs                              | /var/log/efm-            |
| Lock files                        | /var/lock/efm-           |

## Debian or Ubuntu Host

To install , you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, visit the EnterpriseDB website at:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request>

Follow the links in the EDB table to request credentials.

The following steps will walk you through using the EnterpriseDB apt repository to install . When using the commands, replace the *username* and *password* with the credentials provided by EnterpriseDB.

1.  Assume superuser privileges:

<!-- -->

```
sudo su -
```

1.  Configure the EnterpriseDB apt repository:

<!-- -->

```
sh -c 'echo “deb https://<username>:<password>@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release - cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main” > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
```

1.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

<!-- -->

```
apt-get install apt-transport-https
```

1.  Add the EDB signing key:

<!-- -->

```
wget -q -O - https://<username>:<password>@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add -
```

1.  Update the repository meta data:

<!-- -->

```
apt-get update
```

1.  Install :

<!-- -->

```
apt-get -y install edb-efm40
```

## SLES Host

To install , you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, visit the EnterpriseDB website at:

> <https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request>

You can use the zypper package manager to install a agent on an SLES 12 host. zypper will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but requires access to specific repositories that are not hosted at EnterpriseDB.

1.  You must assume superuser privileges and stop any firewalls before installing . Then, use the following commands to add EnterpriseDB repositories to your system:

```
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo
```

2.  The commands create the repository configuration files in the `/etc/zypp/repos.d` directory. Then, use the following command to refresh the metadata on your SLES host to include the EnterpriseDB repository:

```
zypper refresh
```

When prompted, provide credentials for the repository, and specify a to always trust the provided key, and update the metadata to include the EnterpriseDB repository.

3.  You must also add SUSEConnect and the SUSE Package Hub extension to the SLES host, and register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories. Use the commands:

```
zypper install SUSEConnect
SUSEConnect -r <registration_number> -e <user_id>
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.4/x86_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.4/x86_64
```

1.  Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories:

<!-- -->

```
zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache:/Modules/SLE_12_SP4/Apache:Modules.repo
```

1.  Install OpenJDK (version 1.8) for Java based components:

<!-- -->

```
zypper -n install java-1_8_0-openjdk
```

6.  Now you can use the zypper utility to install a agent:

```
zypper -n install edb-efm40
```
