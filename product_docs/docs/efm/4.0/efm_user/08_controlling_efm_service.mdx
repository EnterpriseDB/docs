<div id="controlling_efm_service" class="registered_link"></div>


Each node in a cluster hosts a agent that is controlled by a service script. By default, the service script expects to find:

-   A configuration file named `efm.properties` that contains the properties used by the service. Each node of a replication scenario must contain a properties file that provides information about the node.
-   A cluster members file named `efm.nodes` that contains a list of the cluster members. Each node of a replication scenario must contain a cluster members list.

Note that if you are running multiple clusters on a single node you will need to manually create configuration files with cluster-specific names and modify the service script for the corresponding clusters.

The commands that control the service are platform-specific.

## Using the service Utility on RHEL 6.x and CentOS 6.x

On RHEL 6.x and CentOS 6.x, runs as a Linux service named (by default) edb-efm- that is located in /etc/init.d. Each database cluster monitored by will run a copy of the service on each node of the replication cluster.

Use the following service commands to control a agent that resides on a RHEL 6.x or CentOS 6.x host:

<div class="parsed-literal">

service edb-efm- start

</div>

The start command starts the agent on the current node. The local agent monitors the local database and communicates with on the other nodes. You can start the nodes in a cluster in any order. This command must be invoked by root.

<div class="parsed-literal">

service edb-efm- stop

</div>

Stop the on the current node. This command must be invoked by root.

<div class="parsed-literal">

service edb-efm- status

</div>

The status command returns the status of the agent on which it is invoked. You can invoke the status command on any node to instruct to return status information. For example:

<div class="parsed-literal">

\[<witness@localhost> \~\]\# service edb-efm- status edb-efm- (pid 50836) is running...

</div>

<div class="parsed-literal">

service edb-efm- help

</div>

Display online help for the service script.

## Using the systemctl Utility on RHEL/CentOS 7.x and RHEL/CentOS 8.x

On RHEL/CentOS 7.x and RHEL/CentOS 8.x, runs as a Linux service named (by default) `edb-efm-4.0.service` that is located in `/usr/lib/systemd/system`. Each database cluster monitored by Failover Manager will run a copy of the service on each node of the replication cluster.

Use the following systemctl commands to control a agent that resides on a RHEL/CentOS 7.x and RHEL/CentOS 8.x host:

<div class="parsed-literal">

systemctl start edb-efm-

</div>

The start command starts the agent on the current node. The local agent monitors the local database and communicates with on the other nodes. You can start the nodes in a cluster in any order. This command must be invoked by root.

<div class="parsed-literal">

systemctl stop edb-efm-

</div>

Stop the on the current node. This command must be invoked by root.

<div class="parsed-literal">

systemctl status edb-efm-

</div>

The status command returns the status of the agent on which it is invoked. You can invoke the status command on any node to instruct to return status and server startup information.

<div class="parsed-literal">
