The following changes have been made to EDB Postgres Failover Manager to create version 3.7:

-   Failover Manager now supports Advanced Server and PostgreSQL version 12. Please note that the database user must have sufficient permissions to read the values of configuration variables; a database superuser can use the PostgreSQL `GRANT` command to provide the permissions needed:

    `GRANT pg_read_all_settings TO user_name;`

For more information about `pg_read_all_settings`, please see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/default-roles.html)

-   The `application.name` property behavior is changed. For more information about `application.name`, see `The Cluster Properties File <cluster_properties>`.
-   The `db.recovery.conf.dir` property has been replaced by the `db.recovery.dir` property. For more information about the `db.config.dir` property, see `The Cluster Properties File <cluster_properties>`.
