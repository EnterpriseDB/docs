Failover Manager will send e-mail notifications and/or invoke a notification script when a notable event occurs that affects the cluster. If you have configured Failover Manager to send an email notification, you must have an SMTP server running on port 25 on each node of the cluster. Use the following parameters to configure notification behavior for Failover Manager:

    user.email
    script.notification
    from.email

For more information about editing the configuration properties, see `Specifying Cluster Properties <cluster_properties>` .

The body of the notification contains details about the event that triggered the notification, and about the current state of the cluster. For example:

    EFM node: 10.0.1.11
    Cluster name: acctg
    Database name: postgres
    VIP: ip_address (Active|Inactive)
    Database health is not being monitored.

The VIP field displays the IP address and state of the virtual IP if implemented for the node.

Failover Manager assigns a severity level to each notification. The following levels indicate increasing levels of attention required:

> `INFO` indicates an informational message about the agent and does not require any manual intervention (for example, Failover Manager has started or stopped).
>
> `WARNING` indicates that an event has happened that requires the administrator to check on the system (for example, failover has occurred).
>
> `SEVERE` indicates that a serious event has happened and requires the immediate attention of the administrator (for example, failover was attempted, but was unable to complete).

The severity level designates the urgency of the notification. A notification with a severity level of `SEVERE` requires user attention immediately, while a notification with a severity level of `INFO` will call your attention to operational information about your cluster that does not require user action. Notification severity levels are not related to logging levels; all notifications are sent regardless of the log level detail specified in the configuration file.

You can use the [notification.level](04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#notification_level) property to specify the minimum severity level that will trigger a notification.

Please note: In addition to sending notices to the administrative email address, all notifications are recorded in the cluster log file (`/var/log/efm-3.7/cluster_name.log`).

The conditions listed in the table below will trigger an `INFO` level notification:
