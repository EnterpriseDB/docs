title: "The Cluster Members File"
---

<div id="cluster_members" class="registered_link"></div>


Each node in a cluster has a cluster members file (by default, named efm.nodes) that contains a list of the current Failover Manager cluster members. When an agent starts, it uses the file to locate other cluster members. The installer creates a file template for the cluster members file named `efm.nodes.in` in the `/etc/edb/efm-3.10` directory.

After completing the installation, you must make a working copy of the template:

<div class="parsed-literal">

\# cp /etc/edb/efm-/efm.nodes.in /etc/edb/efm-/efm.nodes

</div>

After copying the template file, change the owner of the file to `efm`:

> `chown efm:efm efm.nodes`

By default, expects the cluster members file to be named `efm.nodes`. If you name the cluster members file something other than `efm.nodes`, you must modify the service script to instruct to use the new name.

The cluster members file on the first node started can be empty; this node will become the Membership Coordinator. On each subsequent node, the cluster member file must contain the address and port number of the Membership Coordinator. Each entry in the cluster members file must be listed in an address:port format, with multiple entries separated by white space.

The Membership Coordinator will update the contents of the `efm.nodes` file to match the current members of the cluster. As agents join or leave the cluster, the `efm.nodes` files on other agents are updated to reflect the current cluster membership. If you invoke the [efm stop-cluster](../#efm_stop_cluster) command, does not modify the file.

If the Membership Coordinator leaves the cluster, another node will assume the role. You can use the [efm cluster-status](../#efm_cluster_status) command to find the address of the Membership Coordinator. If a node joins or leaves a cluster while an agent is down, you must manually ensure that the file includes at least the current Membership Coordinator.

If you know the IP addresses and ports of the nodes that will be joining the cluster, you can include the addresses in the cluster members file at any time. At startup, any addresses that do not identify cluster members will be ignored unless the `auto.allow.hosts` property (in the [cluster properties file](../04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#auto_allow_hosts)) is set to `true`.

If the `stable.nodes.file` property (located in the [cluster properties file](../04_configuring_efm/01_cluster_properties/#auto_allow_hosts)) is set to `true`, the Membership Coordinator will not update the `.nodes` file when cluster members join or leave the cluster; this behavior is most useful when the IP addresses of cluster members do not change often.
