BigAnimal supports three cluster types: 
- Single node
- Standard high availability
- Extreme high availability (Preview)

You choose which type of cluster you want on the [Create Cluster](https://portal.biganimal.com/create-cluster) page in the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal.  

Postgres distribution and version support varies by cluster type.

| Postgres distribution |     Versions     |          Cluster type          |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------ |
| PostgreSQL            | 11–15            | Single node, high availability |
| Oracle Compatible     | 11–15            | Single node, high availability |
| Oracle Compatible     | 12–15            | Extreme high availability      |
| PostgreSQL Compatible | 12-15            | Extreme high availability      |

## Single node

For nonproduction use cases where high availability is not a primary concern, a cluster deployment with high availability not enabled provides one primary with no standby replicas for failover or read-only workloads. 

In case of unrecoverable failure of the primary, a restore from a backup is required.

## High availability

The high availability option is provided to minimize downtime in cases of failures. High-availability clusters—one *primary* and one or two *standby replicas*—are configured automatically, with standby replicas staying up to date through physical streaming replication. 

If read-only workloads are enabled, then standby replicas serve the read-only workloads. In a two-node cluster, the single standby replica serves read-only workloads. In a three-node cluster, both standby replicas serve read-only workloads. The connections are made to the two standby replicas randomly and on a per-connection basis. 

In cloud regions with availability zones, clusters are provisioned across zones to provide fault tolerance in the face of a datacenter failure.

In case of temporary or permanent unavailability of the primary, a standby replica becomes the primary.

Incoming client connections are always routed to the current primary. In case of failure of the primary, a standby replica is automatically promoted to primary, and new connections are routed to the new primary. When the old primary recovers, it rejoins the cluster as a standby replica.

### Standby replicas

By default, replication is synchronous to one standby replica and asynchronous to the other. That is, one standby replica must confirm that a transaction record was written to disk before the client receives acknowledgment of a successful commit. 

In a cluster with one primary and one replica (a two-node high availability cluster), you run the risk of the cluster being unavailable for writes because it doesn't have the same level of reliability as a three-node cluster. Note that BigAnimal automatically disables synchronous replication during maintenance operations of a two-node cluster to ensure write availability. You can also change from the default synchronous replication for a two-node cluster to asynchronous replication on a per-session/per-transaction basis.

In PostgreSQL terms, `synchronous_commit` is set to `on` and `synchronous_standby_names` is set to `ANY 1 (replica-1, replica-2)`. You can modify this behavior on a per-transaction, per-session, per-user, or per-database basis with appropriate `SET` or `ALTER` commands. 

To ensure write availability, BigAnimal disables synchronous replication during maintenance operations of a two-node cluster.

Since BigAnimal replicates to only one node synchronously, some standby replicas in three-node clusters might experience replication lag. Also, if you override the BigAnimal synchronous replication configuration, then the standby replicas are inconsistent. 

## Extreme high availability (Preview)

For use cases where high availability across regions is a major concern, a cluster deployment with extreme high availability enabled can provide two data group with 3 data nodes each, plus a witness group, for a true active-active solution. Extreme high-availability clusters offer the ability to deploy a cluster across multiple regions or a single region. Extreme high availability clusters are powered by EDB Postgres Distributed using logical replication.

Extreme high-availability clusters can be deployed with PostgreSQL compatibility or Oracle compatibility. 

Extreme high-availability clusters are configured according to *data groups*. EDB Postgres Distributed clusters create a PGD global group, which contains one or two data groups. Your data groups can be made up of a combination of data nodes and witness nodes. One of these data nodes is the leader at any given time, while the rest are shadow nodes. 

The witness node/witness group doesn't host data but exists for management purposes, supporting operations that require a consensus, for example, in case of an availability zone failure. 

The following are valid node configurations for one data group:

- 2 data nodes + 1 local witness node
   ![2 data + 1 local witness (default)](images/SingleDataGroup-1.png)
- 3 data nodes (default)
   ![3 data nodes](images/SingleDataGroup-2.png)

If you're looking for a true active-active solution that protects against regional failures, select a two data group configuration. The following are the possible configurations for two data groups:

- 3 data nodes + 3 data nodes, 1 witness group in a different region 
   ![3 data nodes + 3 data nodes, 1 witness group in a different region ](images/2DataGroups-1.png)

- 2 data nodes + 1 witness node, 2 data nodes + 1 witness node, and 1 witness group in a different region
   ![2 data nodes + 1 witness node, 2 data nodes + 1 witness node, and 1 witness group in a different region](images/2DataGroups-2.png)

If you want to restore an extreme high-availability cluster, you can only restore one data group at a time. If you want to restore the second data group to the same cluster, you need to manually enter its details.
