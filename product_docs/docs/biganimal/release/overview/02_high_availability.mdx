BigAnimal enables deploying a single node cluster with no standby servers or with two standby replicas in different availability zones (high availability) or exteme high availability leveraging EDB Postgres Distributed. You chose you which type of deployment you want when creating your cluster on the [Create Cluster](https://portal.biganimal.com/create-cluster) page in the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal.    

## High availability—enabled

The high availability option is provided to minimize downtime in cases of failures. High-availability clusters—one *primary* and two *replicas*—are configured automatically, with replicas staying up to date through physical streaming replication. In cloud regions with availability zones, clusters are provisioned across multiple availability zones to provide fault tolerance in the face of a datacenter failure.

-   Replicas are usually called *standby servers*. 
-   In case of temporary or permanent unavailability of the primary, a standby replica becomes the primary.

Incoming client connections are always routed to the current primary. In case of failure of the primary, a standby replica is automatically promoted to primary, and new connections are routed to the new primary. When the old primary recovers, it rejoins the cluster as a replica.

By default, replication is synchronous to one replica and asynchronous to the other. That is, one replica must confirm that a transaction record was written to disk before the client receives acknowledgment of a successful commit. In PostgreSQL terms, `synchronous_commit` is set to `on` and `synchronous_standby_names` is set to `ANY 1 (replica-1, replica-2)`. You can modify this behavior on a per-transaction, per-session, per-user, or per-database basis with appropriate `SET` or `ALTER` commands.

## High availability—not enabled

For nonproduction use cases where high availability is not a primary concern, a cluster deployment with high availability not enabled provides one primary with no standby servers for failover or read-only workloads. 

In case of permanent unavailability of the primary, a restore from a backup is required.
