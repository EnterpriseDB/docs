## Next steps

To successfully deploy a cluster, you must activate the region to prepare its cloud infrastructure. See [Activating regions](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/activating_regions) for more information.

!!! Tip
    You can select a cloud region for deploying your cluster even if it is not yet *Active*. However, your cluster creation request is added to a queue, and the cluster is created only after you activate the region.
