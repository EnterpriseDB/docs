BigAnimal's cloud account offers users a seamless deployment option for users that don't want to set up a separate cloud account for their cluster. If you want to use a separate cloud account, then you can set one up. 

!!! Note 
    Currently, BigAnimal's cloud account is offered only with AWS as your cloud provider.

Using BigAnimal's cloud account or a separate cloud account incurs different costs. For more information, see [Pricing and billing](../pricing_and_billing).
