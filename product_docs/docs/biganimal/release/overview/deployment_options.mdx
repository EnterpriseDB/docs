title: Deployment options
---

You have two deployment options with BigAnimal. You can use your own cloud service provider account to deploy BigAnimal or you can use BigAnimal's cloud account.

Using BigAnimal's cloud account or a separate cloud account incurs different costs. For more information, see [Pricing and billing](../pricing_and_billing).

## Using your own cloud account

You can use your AWS or Azure account to deploy BigAnimal. In this deployment model, you are responsible for your managing your cloud resources and connecting your cloud to BigAnimal. 

## Using BigAnimal's cloud account

BigAnimal's cloud account offers a seamless deployment option if you don't want to set up a separate cloud account for your clusters. 

!!! Note Note
Currently, BigAnimal's cloud account is offered only with AWS as your cloud provider.

### BigAnimal's cloud account: Postgres distributions

In order for us to effectively manage the cloud resources and ensure the Postgres distributions are protected against security threats, BigAnimal's cloud account provides specially built Postgres distributions. The Postgres distributions have a special administrative role, pg_ba_admin, and special user that is a member of that role, ba_admin_user, which has sufficient privileges to allow your admin to effectively maintain your database.

### What pg_ba_admin can do
The pg_ba_admin user can perform the following operations:
- Create roles
- Create databases
- Read and write to all user objects (tables, views, and so on)
- Perform all monitoring functions on the Postgres instance (it has the pg_monitor role)
- Install supported EDB extensions (see [Supported Postgres extensions and tools](biganimal/latest/overview/extensions_tools/))

### What pg_ba_admin can't do
Using any Postgres distribution, the pg_ba_admin user can't perform the following operations that a Postgres superuser can:

- Execute programs on the server (pg_ba_admin doesn't have the pg_server_programs privileges)
- Create tablespaces
- Read and write files on the server (pg_ba_admin doesn't have the permissions pg_read_server_files and pg_write_server_files)
- Execute the qreplace_function
- Define LEAKPROOF functions
- Use portions of the DBMS package that require writing the network or the filesystem
- Set parameters related to edb_audit
- Create functions in non-trusted languages such as Python and C
- Execute CREATE USER IDENTIFIED BY
- Install unsupported extensions (see [Supported Postgres extensions and tools](biganimal/latest/overview/extensions_tools/))

The pg_ba_admin user can't perform the following additional operations using an EDB Postgres Advanced Server distribution:

- Create resource groups
- Access the network or make use of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server http packages that access the network 
- Create an Operator Class 
- Change the encoding using DBMS_SESSION 
- Make use of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server UTIL_FILE packages that access the file system

### Postgres pre-defined roles assigned to pg_ba_admin

The pg_ba_admin user has the following roles that are predefined in Postgres:

| Role   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

| pg_read_all_data     | Read all data (tables, views, sequences), as if having SELECT rights on those objects, and USAGE rights on all schemas, even without having it explicitly. This role does not have the role attribute BYPASSRLS set. If RLS is being used, an administrator may wish to set BYPASSRLS on roles which this role is GRANTed to.                      |
| pg_write_all_data    | Write all data (tables, views, sequences), as if having INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE rights on those objects, and USAGE rights on all schemas, even without having it explicitly. This role does not have the role attribute BYPASSRLS set. If RLS is being used, an administrator may wish to set BYPASSRLS on roles which this role is GRANTed to. |
| pg_read_all_settings | Read all configuration variables, even those normally visible only to superusers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| pg_read_all_stats    | Read all pg_stat_* views and use various statistics related extensions, even those normally visible only to superusers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
