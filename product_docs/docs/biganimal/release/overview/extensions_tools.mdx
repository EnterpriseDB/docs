### EDB Postgres extensions and tools
EDB develops and maintains several extensions and tools. These include:

- [EDB Advanced Storage Pack](/pg_extensions/advanced_storage_pack/) &mdash; Provides advanced storage options for PostgreSQL databases in the form of table access method (TAM) extensions.

  - [Refdata](/pg_extensions/advanced_storage_pack/#refdata) &mdash; Can provide performance gains of 5-10% and increased scalability.
- [EDB Postgres Tuner](/pg_extensions/pg_tuner/) &mdash; Provides safe recommendations that maximize the use of available resources. 
- [Foreign Data Wrappers](foreign_data_wrappers) &mdash; Allow you to connect your Postgres database server to external data sources.
- [Connection poolers](poolers) &mdash; Allow you manage your connections to your Postgres database.
