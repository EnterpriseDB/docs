title: EDB PgBouncer
---

EDB PgBouncer can manage your connections to Postgres databases and help your workloads run more efficiently. It's particularly useful if you plan to use more than a few hundred active connections. You can enable EDB PgBouncer to be entirely managed by BigAnimal, when creating your cluster. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#pgbouncer). 

BigAnimal provisions up to three instances per EDB PgBouncer-enabled cluster to ensure that performance is unaffected, so each availability zone receives its own instance of EDB PgBouncer. 

!!!Note
   Currently, you can't enable EDB PgBouncer when creating a distributed high-availability cluster.

If you want to deploy and manage PgBouncer outside of BigAnimal, see the [How to configure EDB PgBouncer with BigAnimal cluster](https://support.biganimal.com/hc/en-us/articles/4848726654745-How-to-configure-PgBouncer-with-BigAnimal-Cluster) knowledge-base article.
