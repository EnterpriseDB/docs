BigAnimal supports [EDB PgBouncer](/pgbouncer/latest/) and [EDB Pgpool-II](/pgpool/latest/) to manage your connections to your Postgres database. PgBouncer can be hosted on BigAnimal or self-hosted, while EDB Pgpool-II can only be self-hosted.


### EDB PgBouncer

EDB PgBouncer can manage your connections to Postgres databases and help your workloads run more efficiently. It's particularly useful if you plan to use more than a few hundred active connections. You can enable EDB PgBouncer to be hosted by BigAnimal when creating your cluster. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#pgbouncer). 

BigAnimal provisions up to three instances per EDB PgBouncer-enabled cluster to ensure that performance is unaffected, so each availability zone receives its own instance of EDB PgBouncer. 

If you want to self-host your EDB PgBouncer deployment, see the [How to configure EDB PgBouncer with BigAnimal cluster](https://support.biganimal.com/hc/en-us/articles/4848726654745-How-to-configure-PgBouncer-with-BigAnimal-Cluster) knowledge-base article.


### EDB Pgpool-II

EDB Pgpool-II acts as middleware between client applications and a Postgres database server. It saves connections to the Postgres servers and reuses them whenever a new connection with the same properties (that is, username, database, protocol version) comes in. It reduces connection overhead and improves the system's overall throughput.

See [EDB Pgpool-II](/pgpool/latest/) for information on installing and configuring self-hosted EDB Pgpool-II.
