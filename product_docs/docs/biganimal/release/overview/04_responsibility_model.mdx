Security and confidentiality is a shared responsibility between you and EDB. EDB provides a secure platform that enables you to create and maintain secure database clusters deployed on BigAnimal. You have numerous responsibilities around the security of your clusters and data held within them.

The following responsibility model describes the distribution of specific responsibilities between you and EDB.


## High availability
- EDB is responsible for deploying clusters with one primary and two replicas. In cloud regions with availability zones, clusters will be deployed across multiple availability zones. 
- You are responsible for choosing if you want to enable high availability. 


## Database performance
- EDB is responsible for managing and monitoring the underlying infrastructure resources. 
- You are responsible for data modeling, query performance, and scaling the cluster to meet your performance needs. 

## Scaling 
- EDB is responsible for managing and monitoring the underlying infrastructure.
- You are responsible for choosing the appropriate resources for your workload, including instance type, storage, and connections. You are also responsible for managing your Azure resource limits to ensure the underlying infrastructure can be scaled.

## Backups and restores
- EDB is responsible for taking automatic backups and storing them in cross-regional Azure Blob Storage. 
- You are responsible for periodically restoring and verifying the restores to ensure that archives are completing frequently and successfully to meet your needs. 

## Encryption
- EDB is responsible for data encryption at rest and in transit. EDB is also responsible for encrypting backups.
- You are responsible for column level encryption to protect sensitive database attributes from unauthorized access by authorized users and applications of the database.

## Credential management 
- EDB is responsible for making credentials available to customers.
- You are responsible for managing and securing your passwords, both for BigAnimal and your database passwords.
