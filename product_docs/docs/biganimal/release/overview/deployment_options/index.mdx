You have two deployment options with BigAnimal. You can deploy clusters in your own cloud account, or you can deploy in BigAnimal's cloud account.

To learn about the pricing of these two deployment options, see [Pricing and billing](/biganimal/latest/pricing_and_billing/).

## Using your own cloud account

When deploying in your own cloud account, you need to set up your cloud service provider. You can use your AWS or Azure account. In this deployment model, you are responsible for your managing your cloud resources and connecting your cloud to BigAnimal. To set up your cloud service provider, see [Checking your cloud readiness](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/preparing_cloud_account/). 

## Using BigAnimal's cloud account

BigAnimal's cloud account offers a seamless deployment option if you don't want to set up a separate cloud account for your clusters. You can deploy a cluster in BigAnimal's cloud account instantly. 

!!! Note Note
Currently, when you deploy in BigAnimal's cloud account, you can use AWS or Google Cloud as your cloud provider.
