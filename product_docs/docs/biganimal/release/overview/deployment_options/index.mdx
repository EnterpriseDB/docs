You have two deployment options with BigAnimal. You can deploy clusters in your own cloud account or you can deploy in BigAnimal's cloud account.

To learn about how these two deployment options are priced, see [Pricing and billing](/biganimal/latest/pricing_and_billing/).

## Using your own cloud account

When deploying in your own cloud account, you will need to setup your CSP. You can use your AWS or Azure account. In this deployment model, you are responsible for your managing your cloud resources and connecting your cloud to BigAnimal. To setup your CSP, see [Checking your cloud readiness](biganimal/latest/getting_started/preparing_cloud_account/). 

## Using BigAnimal's cloud account

BigAnimal's cloud account offers a seamless deployment option if you don't want to set up a separate cloud account for your clusters. You can deploy a cluster in BigAnimal's cloud account instantly. 

!!! Note Note
Currently, when you deploy in BigAnimal's cloud account you can only use AWS as your cloud provider.
