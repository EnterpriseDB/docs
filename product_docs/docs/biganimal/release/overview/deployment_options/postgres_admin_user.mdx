Learn about what operations the pg_ba_admin user can perform and what Postgres built-in roles it has.

## What pg_ba_admin can do
The pg_ba_admin user can perform the following operations:
- Create roles
- Create databases
- Read and write to all user objects (tables, views, and so on)
- Perform all monitoring functions on the Postgres instance (it has the pg_monitor role)
- Install supported EDB extensions (see [Supported Postgres extensions and tools](biganimal/latest/overview/extensions_tools/))

## What pg_ba_admin can't do
The pg_ba_admin user can't perform the following operations that a Postgres superuser can:

- Execute programs on the server (pg_ba_admin doesn't have the `pg_execute_server_program` role)
- Create tablespaces
- Read and write files on the server (pg_ba_admin doesn't have the permissions pg_read_server_files and pg_write_server_files)
- Execute the qreplace_function
- Define LEAKPROOF functions
- Use portions of the DBMS package that require writing the network or the filesystem
- Set parameters related to edb_audit (not applicable to PostgreSQL)
- Create functions in non-trusted languages such as Python and C
- Execute CREATE USER IDENTIFIED BY
- Install unsupported extensions (see [Supported Postgres extensions and tools](biganimal/latest/overview/extensions_tools/))

The pg_ba_admin user can't perform the following additional operations using an EDB Postgres Advanced Server distribution:

- Create resource groups
- Access the network or make use of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server http packages that access the network 
- Create an Operator Class 
- Change the encoding using DBMS_SESSION 
- Make use of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server UTIL_FILE packages that access the file system

| pg_read_all_data     | Read all data (tables, views, sequences), as if having SELECT rights on those objects, and USAGE rights on all schemas, even without having it explicitly. This role does not have the role attribute BYPASSRLS set. If RLS is being used, an administrator may wish to set BYPASSRLS on roles which this role is GRANTed to.                      |
| pg_write_all_data    | Write all data (tables, views, sequences), as if having INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE rights on those objects, and USAGE rights on all schemas, even without having it explicitly. This role does not have the role attribute BYPASSRLS set. If RLS is being used, an administrator may wish to set BYPASSRLS on roles which this role is GRANTed to. |
| pg_read_all_settings | Read all configuration variables, even those normally visible only to superusers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
