BigAnimal is a fully managed database-as-a-service that can deploy in your cloud account or in BigAnimal's, where it's operated by the Postgres experts. BigAnimal makes it easy to set up, manage, and scale your databases. You can use [PostgreSQL](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/supported-open-source/postgresql/), [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/) with Oracle compatibility, or [EDB Postgres Extended Server](/pge/latest/) with extreme high availability for your Postgres database.
