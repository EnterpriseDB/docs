EDB BigAnimal is a fully managed database-as-a-service that runs in your cloud account or BigAnimal's cloud account, where it's operated by one of the builders of Postgres. BigAnimal makes it easy to set up, manage, and scale your databases. You can use [PostgreSQL](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/supported-open-source/postgresql/) or [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/) with Oracle compatibility, or you can choose distributed high-availability cluster types to use geographically distributed databases.
