Region support varies by whether you're using [your cloud account](#your-cloud-account) or [Biganimal's cloud account](#biganimals-cloud-account) as your [deployment option](/biganimal/release/planning/deployment_options).

See [Country and geographical region reference](country_reference) for information on geographical region short names and the countries that are in each geographical region.

## Your cloud account

When using your cloud account, to successfully deploy a cluster, you must activate the region to prepare its cloud infrastructure. See [Activating regions](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/activating_regions) for more information.

!!! Tip
    You can select a cloud region for deploying your cluster even if it isn't yet active. However, your cluster creation request is added to a queue, and the cluster is created only after you activate the region.
