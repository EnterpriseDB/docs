title: "Supported regions"

Region support varies by whether you're using [your own cloud account](#your-own-cloud-account) or [Biganimal's cloud account](#biganimals-cloud-account) as your [deployment option](/biganimal/release/overview/deployment_options).

See [Country and geographical region reference](country_reference) for information on geographical region short names and the countries that are in each geographical region.

| Europe (Ireland)   | eu-west-1    |
| Europe (London)    | eu-west-2    |

#### Asia and Pacific (APAC) 

|       Cloud region       |   Short name   | Notes |
| ------------------------ | -------------- | ----- |
| Asia Pacific (Tokyo)     | ap-northeast-1 |
| Asia Pacific (Seoul)     | ap-northeast-2 |

When using your own cloud account, to successfully deploy a cluster, you must activate the region to prepare its cloud infrastructure. See [Activating regions](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/activating_regions) for more information.

!!! Tip
    You can select a cloud region for deploying your cluster even if it is not yet *Active*. However, your cluster creation request is added to a queue, and the cluster is created only after you activate the region.
