title: "Database version policy"
---

We support the major Postgres versions from the date they are made available until the version is retired by EDB (generally five years). See [Platform Compatibility ](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#epas) for more details on support dates for PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server. See [End of life policy](#end-of-life-policy) for details on our policy for retiring deprecated versions.

## Supported Postgres types and versions

|    Postgres distribution     |                      Versions                       |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |

## End of life policy

BigAnimal deprecates support for Postgres versions following the same timeline as PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Advanced Server, and EDB Postgres Extended Server follow the same timelines. We recommend that you take action and upgrade your Postgres databases running on the deprecated version to a later version as soon as possible. 

Six months before the PostgreSQL deprecation date BigAnimal won't allow new instances to be created with the deprecated database version. 

Six months after the PostgreSQL deprecation date BigAnimal will force a major version upgrade to all clusters running the deprecated database version.

The only exception will be customers who have purchased Extended Life Support (ELS) prior to that date. To purchase Extended Life Support, reach out to EDB Sales.

## Key dates for Postgres version 11 retirement

While PostgreSQL officially deprecates version 11 on November 9, 2023, BigAnimal will deprecate PostgreSQL 11 on November 20, 2023 in alignment with the broader EDB portfolio. 

On November 20, 2023, BigAnimal will deprecate support for PostgreSQL 11, EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11, EDB Postgres Extended Server using the following schedule. We recommend that you take action and upgrade your Postgres databases running on major version 11 to a later version, such as PostgreSQL version 15.

BigAnimal will automatically upgrade your Postgres 11 instances to a later version at the end of six months; customers who have purchased Extended Life Support will be exempt. To purchase Extended Life Support, reach out to Sales. BigAnimal reserves the right to upgrade sooner in case of a security issue.

| The PostgreSQL community plans to deprecate PostgreSQL 11 and won't provide any security patches after this date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | November 9, 2023    |
| You should start upgrading your BigAnimal instances to a later major version starting on this date. You can take advantage of BigAnimal's new major version upgrades feature to help support this, or use pg_dump to restore your cluster into a later version.                                                                                    | now to May 20, 2023 |
| You can't create a new instance with PostgreSQL major version 11 in the BigAnimal interfaces after this date.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | May 20, 2023        |
| If you manually restore a cluster, you won't be able to restore it with Postgres 11 after this date. You will need to restore that Postgres 11 cluster into a newer version of Postgres; for example, PostgreSQL version 15.                                                                                                                       | May 20, 2023        |
| BigAnimal will force a major version upgrade and will not allow any new clusters to be provisioned or restored to version 11 even for customers previously using version 11.  Only customers on Extended Life Support will be exempted for the duration of their contract. If you don’t purchase Extended Life Support on this date, your clusters will be upgraded. | April 20, 2024      |
| Extended Life Support will start six months after PostgreSQL community deprecates version 11. BigAnimal does reserve the right to upgrade in case of a security issue.                                                                                                                                                                             | April 20, 2024      |
