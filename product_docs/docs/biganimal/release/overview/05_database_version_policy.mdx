| ----- | ------------------------- |
| PostgreSQL  | 11–13  |

## Major version support

PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server major versions are supported from the date they are made available until the version is retired by EDB (generally five years). See [Platform Compatibility ](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#epas) for more details.



## Minor version support

EDB performs periodic maintenance to ensure stability and security. EDB performs minor version upgrades and patch updates as part of periodic maintenance. Customers are notified in the BigAnimal portal prior to maintenance occurring. You cannot configure minor versions. 

EDB reserves the right to upgrade customers to the latest minor version without prior notice in an extraordinary circumstance.
