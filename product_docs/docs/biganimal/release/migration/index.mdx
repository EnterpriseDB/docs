title: Migrating databases to EDB Cloud
---

EDB provides migration tools to bring data from Oracle, PostgresSQL, and EDB Postgres Advanced Server databases into EDB Cloud. These tools include Migration Portal and Migration Toolkit for Oracle migrations. 



## Migrating from Oracle

The [Migration Portal documentation](../../../migration_portal/latest) provides the details for executing the migration steps using Migration Portal: 

 1. [Schema extraction](../.../../migration_portal/latest/04_mp_migrating_database/01_mp_schema_extraction/)
 1. [Schema assessment](../../../migration_portal/latest/04_mp_migrating_database/02_mp_schema_assessment/)
 1. [Schema migration](../../../migration_portal/latest/04_mp_migrating_database/03_mp_schema_migration/)
 1. [Data migration](../../../migration_portal/latest/04_mp_migrating_database/04_mp_data_migration/)
   
The Migration Portal documentation describes how to use Migration Toolkit for the data migration step. This is a good option for smaller databases. 

## Migrating from Postgres
There are several options available for migrating EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL databases to EDB Cloud. One option is to use the Migration Toolkit. Another simple option for many use cases is to import an existing PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server database EDB Cloud, see [Importing an existing Postgres database](cold_migration).

EDB has other migration tools such as [Replication Server](../../../eprs/latest/) for ongoing migrations and [LiveCompare](../../../livecompare/latest/) to do data comparisons.
