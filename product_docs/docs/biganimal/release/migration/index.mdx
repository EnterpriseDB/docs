title: Migrating databases to BigAnimal
---

EDB provides migration tools to bring data from Oracle, PostgresSQL, and EDB Postgres Advanced Server databases into BigAnimal. These tools include Migration Portal and Migration Toolkit for Oracle migrations. More sophisticated migration processes can use tools such as [Replication Server](/eprs/latest/) for ongoing migrations and [LiveCompare](/livecompare/latest/) for data comparisons. 



## Migrating from Oracle

The [Migration Portal documentation](/migration_portal/latest) provides the details for executing the migration steps using Migration Portal: 

 1. [Schema extraction](/migration_portal/latest/04_mp_migrating_database/01_mp_schema_extraction/)
 1. [Schema assessment](/migration_portal/latest/04_mp_migrating_database/02_mp_schema_assessment/)
 1. [Schema migration](/migration_portal/latest/04_mp_migrating_database/03_mp_schema_migration/)
 1. [Data migration](/migration_portal/latest/04_mp_migrating_database/04_mp_data_migration/)
   
The Migration Portal documentation describes how to use Migration Toolkit for the data migration step. This toolkit is a good option for smaller databases. 

## Migrating from Postgres
Several options are available for migrating EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL databases to BigAnimal. One option is to use the Migration Toolkit. Another simple option for many use cases is to import an existing PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server database BigAnimal. See [Importing an existing Postgres database](cold_migration).
