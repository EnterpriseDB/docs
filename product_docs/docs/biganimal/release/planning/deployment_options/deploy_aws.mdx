---

To use AWS as your cloud account:

- Sign in for the first time with your EDB account, and then either use the BigAnimal portal as your identity provider or [set up your own provider](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/identity_provider/) afterward. 
- [Check the readiness of your AWS account](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/preparing_cloud_account/02_preparing_aws/) before deploying. 
- [Connect your AWS cloud](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/02_connecting_to_your_cloud/connecting_aws/) to BigAnimal. 
- [Connect to BigAnimal](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/02_connecting_your_cluster/02_connecting_from_aws/) using AWS VPC endpoint service. 
- [Review the supported AWS regions](/biganimal/latest/overview/03a_region_support/#aws-regions) where you can create clusters for the AWS account, enabling you to locate your cloud resources close to your customers. 
- [View metrics and logs](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/05_monitoring_and_logging/monitoring_from_aws/) sent from BigAnimal with AWS CloudWatch.
