To use Azure as your cloud account:

- [Connect your Azure Marketplace account](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/02_azure_market_setup/) to BigAnimal.  
- Check the readiness of [your Azure subscription](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/preparing_cloud_account/01_preparing_azure/) before deploying.  
- [Connect your Azure cloud](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/02_connecting_to_your_cloud/connecting_azure/) to BigAnimal. 
- [Connect to BigAnimal](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/02_connecting_your_cluster/01_connecting_from_azure/) from your application's virtual network in Azure. 
- [Review the supported Azure regions](/biganimal/latest/overview/03a_region_support/#azure-regions) where you can create clusters for the Azure account, enabling you to locate your cloud resources close to your customers.
- [View metrics and logs](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/05_monitoring_and_logging/monitoring_from_azure/) sent from BigAnimal in your Azure account. 
- [Configure Azure](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/05_monitoring_and_logging/alerts/) to trigger real-time alerts based on the metrics in BigAnimal.
