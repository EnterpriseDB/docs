## Using logical replication

!!! Note
This procedure doesn't work with distributed high-availability BigAnimal instances.
!!!

Logical replication is a common method for upgrading the Postgres major version on BigAnimal instances, enabling a transition with minimal downtime. 

By replicating changes in real time from an older version (source instance) to a newer one (target instance), this method provides a reliable upgrade path while maintaining database availability.

!!! Important
Depending on where your older and newer versioned BigAnimal instances are located, this procedure can accrue ingress and egress costs from your cloud service provider (CSP) for the migrated data. Consult your CSP's pricing documentation to see how ingress and egress fees are calculated to determine any extra costs.
!!!

### Overview of upgrading

To perform a major version upgrade:

1. [Create a BigAnimal instance.](#create-a-biganimal-instance)
1. [Gather instance information.](#gather-instance-information)
1. [Confirm the Postgres versions before migration.](#confirm-the-postgres-versions-before-migration)
1. [Migrate the database schema.](#migrate-the-database-schema)
1. [Create a publication.](#create-a-publication)
1. [Create a logical replication slot.](#create-the-logical-replication-slot)
1. [Create a subscription.](#create-a-subscription)
1. [Validate the migration.](#validate-the-migration)


### Create a BigAnimal instance

To perform a major version upgrade, create a BigAnimal instance with your desired version of Postgres. This is your target instance.

Ensure your target instance is provisioned with a storage size equal to or greater than your source instance.

For details on creating a BigAnimal instance, see [Creating a cluster](../getting_started/creating_a_cluster.mdx).

### Gather instance information

Use the BigAnimal console to obtain the following information for your source and target instance:

- Read/write URI
- Database name
- Username
- Read/write host

Using the BigAnimal console:

1. Select the **Clusters** tab.
1. Select your source instance.
1. From the **Connect** tab, obtain the information from **Connection Info**.

### Confirm the Postgres versions before migration

Confirm the Postgres version of your source and target BigAnimal instances:

```
psql "<biganimal_read/write_uri>" -c "select version();"
```

Output using Postgres 16:

```
                                                               version                                                               
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PostgreSQL 16.2 (Debian 16.2.0-3.buster) (BigAnimal Edition) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Debian 8.3.0-6) 8.3.0, 64-bit
(1 row)
```

### Migrate the database schema 

On your source instance, use the `dt` command to view the details of the schema to be migrated:

```sql
/dt+;
```

Here's a sample database schema for this example:

```
                                           List of relations
 Schema |       Name       | Type  |   Owner   | Persistence | Access method |    Size    | Description 
--------+------------------+-------+-----------+-------------+---------------+------------+-------------
 public | pgbench_accounts | table | edb_admin | permanent   | heap          | 1572 MB    | 
 public | pgbench_branches | table | edb_admin | permanent   | heap          | 8192 bytes | 
 public | pgbench_history  | table | edb_admin | permanent   | heap          | 0 bytes    | 
 public | pgbench_tellers  | table | edb_admin | permanent   | heap          | 120 kB     | 
```

Use pg_dump with the `--schema-only` flag to copy the schema from your source to your target instance. For more information on using pg_dump, [see the Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html).

```
pg_dump --schema-only  -h <source_biganimal_host> -U <source_biganimal_username> -d <source_biganimal_databasename> | psql -h <target_biganimal_host> -U <target_biganimal_username> -d <target_biganimal_databasename>
```

On the target instance, confirm the schema was migrated:

```
                                         List of relations
 Schema |       Name       | Type  |   Owner   | Persistence | Access method |  Size   | Description 
--------+------------------+-------+-----------+-------------+---------------+---------+-------------
 public | pgbench_accounts | table | edb_admin | permanent   | heap          | 0 bytes | 
 public | pgbench_branches | table | edb_admin | permanent   | heap          | 0 bytes | 
 public | pgbench_history  | table | edb_admin | permanent   | heap          | 0 bytes | 
 public | pgbench_tellers  | table | edb_admin | permanent   | heap          | 0 bytes | 
```

!!! Note
A successful schema-only copy shows the tables with zero bytes.
!!!

### Create a publication 

Use the `CREATE PUBLICATION` command to create a publication on your source instance. For more information on using `CREATE PUBLICATION`, see [the Posgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createpublication.html).

```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION <pub_name>;
```

In this example:


```sql
CREATE PUBLICATION v12_pub;
```

The expected output is: `CREATE PUBLICATION`.

Add tables that you want to replicate to your target instance:

```sql
ALTER PUBLICATION <pub_name> ADD TABLE <table_name>;
```

```sql
ALTER PUBLICATION v12_pub ADD TABLE pgbench_accounts;
ALTER PUBLICATION v12_pub ADD TABLE pgbench_branches;
ALTER PUBLICATION v12_pub ADD TABLE pgbench_history;
ALTER PUBLICATION v12_pub ADD TABLE pgbench_tellers;
```

The expected output is: `ALTER PUBLICATION`.

### Create the logical replication slot

On the source instance, create a replication slot using the `pgoutput` plugin:

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('<slot_name>','pgoutput');
```

In the current example:

```sql
SELECT pg_create_logical_replication_slot('v12_pub','pgoutput');
```

The expected output returns the `slot_name` and `lsn`.

```
 pg_create_logical_replication_slot 
------------------------------------
 (v12_pub,0/AC003330)
```

The replication slot tracks changes to the published tables from the source instance and replicates changes to the subscriber on the target instance.

### Create a subscription

Use the `CREATE SUBSCRIPTION` command to create a subscription on your target instance. For more information on using `CREATE SUBSCRIPTION`, see [the Postgres documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createsubscription.html).

```sql
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION <name_of_subscription> CONNECTION 'user=<source_instance_username> host=<source_instance_read/write_host> sslmode=require port=<source_instance_port> dbname=<source_instance_dbname> password=<source_instance_password>' PUBLICATION <publication_name> WITH (enabled=true, copy_data = true, create_slot = false, slot_name=<slot_name>);
```

This example creates a subscription on a Postgres 16 instance to a publication on a Postgres 12 instance:

```sql
CREATE SUBSCRIPTION v16_sub CONNECTION 'user=edb_admin host=p-x67kjhacc4.pg.biganimal.io sslmode=require port=5432 dbname=edb_admin password=XXX' PUBLICATION v12_pub WITH (enabled=true, copy_data = true, create_slot = false, slot_name=v12_pub);
```

The expected output is: `CREATE SUBSCRIPTION`.

In this example, the subscription uses a connection string to specify the source database and includes options to copy existing data and to follow the publication identified by `v12_pub`. 

The subscriber pulls schema changes (with some exceptions, as noted in the PostgreSQL [documentation on Limitations of Logical Replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logical-replication-restrictions.html)) and data from the source to the target database, effectively replicating the data.

### Validate the migration

To validate the progress of the data migration, use `dt+` from the source and target BigAnimal instances to compare the size of each table.
 
```
                                           List of relations
 Schema |       Name       | Type  |   Owner   | Persistence | Access method |    Size    | Description 
--------+------------------+-------+-----------+-------------+---------------+------------+-------------
 public | pgbench_accounts | table | edb_admin | permanent   | heap          | 1572 MB    | 
 public | pgbench_branches | table | edb_admin | permanent   | heap          | 8192 bytes | 
 public | pgbench_history  | table | edb_admin | permanent   | heap          | 0 bytes    | 
 public | pgbench_tellers  | table | edb_admin | permanent   | heap          | 120 kB     | 
```

```
                                         List of relations
 Schema |       Name       | Type  |   Owner   | Persistence | Access method |  Size   | Description 
--------+------------------+-------+-----------+-------------+---------------+---------+-------------
 public | pgbench_accounts | table | edb_admin | permanent   | heap          | 0 bytes | 
 public | pgbench_branches | table | edb_admin | permanent   | heap          | 0 bytes | 
 public | pgbench_history  | table | edb_admin | permanent   | heap          | 0 bytes | 
 public | pgbench_tellers  | table | edb_admin | permanent   | heap          | 0 bytes | 
```

If logical replication is running correctly, each time you run `\dt+;` you see that more data was migrated:

```
                                         List of relations
 Schema |       Name       | Type  |   Owner   | Persistence | Access method |  Size   | Description 
--------+------------------+-------+-----------+-------------+---------------+---------+-------------
 public | pgbench_accounts | table | edb_admin | permanent   | heap          | 344 MB  | 
 public | pgbench_branches | table | edb_admin | permanent   | heap          | 0 bytes | 
 public | pgbench_history  | table | edb_admin | permanent   | heap          | 0 bytes | 
 public | pgbench_tellers  | table | edb_admin | permanent   | heap          | 0 bytes | 
```

!!! Note
You can optionally use [LiveCompare](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/livecompare/latest/) to generate a comparison report of the source and target databases to validate that all database objects and data are consistent.
