You can modify your cluster by modifying its [configuration settings](#modify-your-clusters-configuration-settings). 

You can also modify your cluster by installing Postgres extensions. See [Postgres extensions](/biganimal/release/overview/extensions_tools) for more information.


## Modify your cluster's configuration settings

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal.

2. From the [**Clusters**](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page, select the name of the cluster you want to edit.

3. Select **Edit Cluster** from the top right corner of the **Cluster Info** panel.

4. You can modify the following settings on the corresponding tab of the Edit Cluster page:

   !!! Note
       Any changes made to the cluster's instance type, volume type, or volume properties are not automatically applied to its replicas' settings. To avoid lag during replication, ensure that your replicas' instance and storage types are at least as large as the source cluster's instance and storage types. See [Modify a faraway replica](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/managing_replicas/#modify-a-faraway-replica).

   | Identity and Access Management (IAM) Authentication  | Additional Settings | Turn on the ability to log in to Postgres using AWS IAM credentials. You must then run a command to add each userâ€™s credentials to a role that uses IAM authentication in Postgres.

5.  Save your changes.
 !!! Note
     Saving changes might require a database restart.

## Modify a data group

You can modify the data groups in your extreme-high-availability cluster by editing the configuration settings.

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal.

1. On the **Clusters** page, select the data group you want to edit. Data groups appear under the cluster they reside in. 

1. Select **Edit** next to the data group. 

1. Edit the cluster settings in the **Data Groups** tab. See the table in [Modify your cluster configuration settings](#modify-your-clusters-configuration-settings).

1. Select **Save**. 

1. In the popup window, confirm your changes.
