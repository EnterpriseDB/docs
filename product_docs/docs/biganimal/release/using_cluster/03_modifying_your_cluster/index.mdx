You can modify your cluster by modifying its configuration settings.

You can also modify your cluster by installing Postgres extensions. See [Postgres extensions](/biganimal/release/using_cluster/03_modifying_your_cluster/extensions) for more information.


## Modify your cluster

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal.

2. From the [**Clusters**](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page, select the name of the cluster you want to edit.

3. Select **Edit Cluster** from the top right corner of the **Cluster Info** panel.

4. You can modify the following settings on the corresponding tab of the Edit Cluster page:

   !!! Note
       Any changes made to the cluster's instance type, volume type, or volume properties are not automatically applied to its replicas' settings. To avoid lag during replication, ensure that your replicas' instance and storage types are at least as large as the parent cluster's instance and storage types. See [Modify a faraway replica](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/managing_replicas/#modify-a-faraway-replica/).

   | Instance type                                        | Cluster Settings |Changing the instance type can incur higher cloud infrastructure charges.                                            |
   | Volume type                                          | Cluster Settings | You cannot switch between the io2 and io2 Block Express volume types in an AWS cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
   | Volume properties                                    | Cluster Settings | It can take up to six hours to tune IOPS or resize the disks of your cluster because AWS requires a cool down period after volume modifications as explained in the [Limitations](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/modify-volume-requirements.html) section. The volume properties are disabled and cannot be modified while this is in progress. |
   | Networking type (public or private)                  | Cluster Settings | If you are using Azure and previously setup a private link and want to  change to a public network, you must remove the private link resources  before making the change.                                                                                                        |
   | Database configuration parameters                    | DB Configuration | If you are using faraway replicas, there are certain parameters that need to modified in the replica when increased in the replica's parent cluster.

5.  Save your changes.
 !!! Note
     Saving changes might require a database restart.
