## Backups 

BigAnimal backs up the data in your PostgreSQL clusters. Depending on the cloud your cluster is deployed on, BigAnimal uses either of the following cloud object storage solutions:

| Cloud | Object storage solution                                                        |   |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---|
| AWS                      | Amazon S3  (standard tier)                                                                          |   |
| Azure                        | Azure Blob Storage (in the "hot" access tier with geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS)) |   |


!!! Note
    Backups in AWS do not currently support cross-regional replication.

PostgreSQL clusters in BigAnimal are continuously backed up through a combination of base backups and transaction log (WAL) archiving. When a new cluster is created, an initial "base" backup is taken. After that, every time a WAL file is closed, which is, by default, every 5 minutes, it is automatically uploaded to the cloud object storage solution. Your organization is responsible for the charges associated with the cloud object storage solution.

BigAnimal retains backups for 30 days by default.


    

## Restores

If a restore is necessary—for example, in case of an accidental `DROP TABLE` statement—you can restore clusters to any point within the backup retention period.


Cluster restores aren't performed "in-place" on an existing cluster. Instead, a new cluster is created and initialized with data from the backup archive. Restores must replay the transaction logs between the most recent full database backup and the target restore point. Thus restore times (that is, RTO) are dependent on the write activity in the source cluster.

You can restore backups into a new cluster in any region supported by BigAnimal.

### Perform a cluster restore
The restore operation is available for any cluster that has at least one available backup. For newly created clusters, the initial backup becomes available a few minutes after the new cluster is fully operational.
1.  Select the cluster you want to restore on the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page in the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal. 
2.  From **Quick Actions**, select **Restore**.
3.  On the Restore Cluster page: 
    1.  Fill in the required fields.
    2.  In the **Source** section, in the **Point in Time Restore** field, select **Now** on the calendar to restore to the last possible recovery point. Or, choose a timestamp to restore further back in time. 
    3.  Review your selections in **Cluster Summary** and select **Restore Cluster** to begin the restore process.  
4.  The new cluster is now available on the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page.
