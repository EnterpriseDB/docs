### Backups

BigAnimal backs up the data in your PostgreSQL clusters. Backups are stored in Azure Blob Storage, in the "hot" access tier with geo-zone-redundant storage (GZRS). You are responsible for the charges associated with backup storage. See [Azure Blob Storage documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/) for more information.

PostgreSQL clusters in BigAnimal are continuously backed up through a combination of base backups and transaction log (WAL) archiving. When a new cluster is created, an initial "base" backup is taken. After that, every time a WAL file is closed—by default, every 5 minutes—it is automatically uploaded to Azure Blob Storage.

### Restores

If a restore is necessary—for example, in case of an accidental `DROP TABLE` statement—you can restore clusters to any point in time as long as backups are retained in Azure Blob Storage. Currently BigAnimal does not age out backups, so you can restore clusters to any time since cluster creation.

Cluster restores aren't performed "in-place" on an existing cluster. Instead, a new cluster is created and initialized with data from the backup archive. Restores must replay the transaction logs between the most recent full database backup and the target restore point. Thus restore times (that is, RTO) are dependent on the write activity in the source cluster.

You can restore backups into a new cluster in any region supported by BigAnimal.

#### Perform a cluster restore

1.  Select the cluster you want to restore on the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page in the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal. 

2.  From **Quick Actions**, select **Restore**.

3.  On the Restore Cluster page: 

    1.  Fill in the required fields.

    2.  In the **Source** section, in the **Point in Time Restore** field, select **Now** on the calendar to restore to the last possible recovery point. Or, choose a timestamp to restore further back in time. 

    3.  Review your selections in **Cluster Summary** and select **Restore Cluster** to begin the restore process.  

4.  The new cluster is now available on the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page.
