Account owners and contributors can connect, edit, scale, and monitor clusters through the BigAnimal portal. BigAnimal also handles backup and restore.

If your organization coordinated with [BigAnimal Support](../overview/support) to enable the Apache Superset feature, see [Analyzing your data with Apache Superset](06_analyze_with_superset) for information on using Apache Superset to analyze, explore, and visualize data stored in your Postgres clusters.
