Shared tags provides a standard way to categorize and organize resources. Tags are scoped to the organizations and shared among all users in the organization. The access to tags is controlled by existing permission system.

- **Tag assignment** &mdash; You can assign one or more shared tags to individual resource items. This capability enables you to categorize resources effectively and according to the needs.

- **Tag permissions** &mdash; The tag management includes permission settings to control who can create, edit, or delete shared tags. This ensures security and control over the tagging system.
