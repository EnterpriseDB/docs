You can connect to your cluster using [`psql`](http://postgresguide.com/utilities/psql.html), the terminal-based client for Postgres, or another client. For additional security measures see:
- [Recommendations for Settings for SSL Mode](#recommended-settings-for-ssl-mode) 
- [Using a private network to connect to your cluster](#setting-up-azure-infrastructure-to-connect-to-a-private-network-cluster)

## Connect to your cluster using `psql`

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page.

3. Select the name of your cluster.
4. On the **Overview** tab, select the copy icon to the right of the **Quick Connect** field to copy the command for connecting to your cluster using `psql` to your clipboard. `psql` prompts for the edb_admin user password you selected when you created the cluster.
5. Paste the command in your terminal.

## Connect to your cluster using a client other than `psql`

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page.

2. Select the name of your cluster.
3. Select the **Connect** tab. You can review and copy all the relevant information you need from this screen except for the edb_admin user password. Consult the client driver documentation for the connection string format the driver uses.

## Recommended settings for SSL mode

Different clients can have different default TLS/SSL modes (sslmode). For example, `psql` defaults to `prefer`, which means the client will attempt to establish a TLS connection but fall back to non-TLS if the server does not support it. In the `psql` example provided by EDB in the **Quick Connect** field, `sslmode` is explicitly set to `require`, which means the client will attempt a TLS connection and fail if the connection to the server can't be encrypted.

For public connections and in most environments, EDB recommends setting `sslmode` to `verify-full`. This setting ensures that you connect to the server you specified and that the connection is encrypted. BigAnimal generates certificates with LetsEncrypt, a widely trusted certificate authority. Your client machine might already have a bundled CA certificate for LetsEncrypt, for example, at `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` or `/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem`. If it doesn't, your client machine needs a [CA certificate for Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/). Once the CA certificate is in place on your client machine, configure the `sslrootcert` parameter to its location and set the `sslmode` parameter to `verify-full` to verify the certificate to fully validate the connection:

```
psql -W "postgres://edb_admin@xxxxxxxxx.xxxxx.biganimal.io:5432/edb_admin?sslmode=verify-full&sslrootcert=/usr/share/ca-certificates/isrgrootx1.pem"
```

Once connected to the cluster using `psql`, the `conninfo` meta-command shows the encryption protocol being used for communication. In the case of BigAnimal,  TLS (v1.2+) is supported:

```
edb_admin=> \conninfo
You are connected to database "edb_admin" as user "edb_admin" on host "xxxxxxxxx.xxxxx.biganimal.io" at port "5432".
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
```

## Setting up Azure infrastructure to connect to a private network cluster

The Private Networking option offers a higher level of isolation and security by moving your cluster out of the public Internet. Clusters with Private Networking enabled are by default not accessible from outside of your cluster's resource virtual network. You need to perform additional configuration steps to connect your applications in other parts of your Azure infrastructure to your clusters via private network links.

!!! Note
    EDB strongly discourages provisioning additional resources in the cluster's resource virtual network.

You can connect to the private cluster from an application in Azure. See [Connecting from Azure](01_connecting_from_azure), which also contains examples to guide you through the different methods to connect to your cluster.
