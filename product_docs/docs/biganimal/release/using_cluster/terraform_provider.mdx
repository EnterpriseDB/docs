title: BigAnimal Terraform provider
---

BigAnimalâ€™s [Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/EnterpriseDB/biganimal/latest/docs) is an infrastructure-as-code service that allows you to provision cloud resources with the Terraform CLI and incorporate those resources into your existing BigAnimal cloud infrastructure workflows.  

The current version of the Terraform provider offers resources and data sources for creating, reading, updating, and deleting clusters and regions.

The current version of the Terraform provider offers resources and data sources for:
- Creating, updating, and deleting clusters.
- Creating, updating, and deleting faraway replicas. Promoting faraway replica isn't supported in the current version.
- Activating and deactivating regions.
- Creating projects. Connecting the cloud service provider isn't supported in the current version.

The Terraform provider is licensed under the [MPL v2](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/MPL/2.0/).

!!!note
   We provide support for the BigAnimal Terraform provider and not for the underlying environment. 
   To report suspected defects or to submit feature requests, open a GitHub issue using the guidance found [here](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/terraform-provider-biganimal/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#report-an-issue).

## Prerequisites
To use Terraform with BigAnimal, you need: 

- A BigAnimal account with an organization set up. If you don't already have a BigAnimal account, see [Getting started with the BigAnimal free trial](/biganimal/latest/free_trial).

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/downloads) (version 0.13*x* or later) downloaded and installed.
- A BigAnimal API token for use within the Terraform application. See [Getting an API Token](#getting-an-api-token).

## Example usage

```hcl
# Configure the BigAnimal Provider
provider "biganimal" {
  ba_bearer_token = "<redacted>"
  //ba_api_uri = "https://portal.biganimal.com/api/v3" // Optional
}
# Manage the resources
```

## Getting an API token

To use the BigAnimal API, fetch an API bearer token and export it into your environment. (For additional information about using the BigAnimal API, see [here](/biganimal/latest/reference/).) Optionally, credentials can be provided by using the `BA_API_URI` environment variable.

1. Access the script located [here](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-utilities/blob/main/api/get-token.sh).
1. Open the script in `Raw` format.
1. Copy the script and save it locally with the name `get-token.sh`.
1. Modify permissions for the script in your local shell.
1. Run the script locally using a command like the following:
    ```
     sh <local path>/get-token.sh
    ```
  The resulting output instructs you to log in to a URL with an 8-digit user code. For example: 
    ```
     Please login to https://auth.biganimal.com/activate?user_code=JWPL-RCXL with your BigAnimal account
    ``` 
1. In a browser, access the URL, confirm, and reauthenticate if necessary. 
    A notice lets you know that the code was verified.
1. In your local shell, a prompt asks:
    ```
     Have you finished the login successfully. (y/n)
    ```
1. Enter `y`. The shell responds with output that provides the access token, refresh token, scope, expiration period, and token type.
1. Export the access token into your environment as follows, replacing `<REDACTED>` with the access token:
    ```bash
    export BA_BEARER_TOKEN=<REDACTED>
    ```
    Rather than export the token, you can alternatively use the token to set the value of the `ba_bearer_token` when configuring the BigAnimal provider, as shown in [Example usage](#example-usage).  
1. Now you can follow along with the [examples](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/terraform-provider-biganimal/blob/main/examples/README.md) in the Terraform repository.
