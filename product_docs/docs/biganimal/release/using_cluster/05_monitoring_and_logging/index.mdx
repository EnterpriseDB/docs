You can monitor your Postgres clusters by viewing the metrics and logs from your cloud provider. For more information about viewing metrics and logs from your cloud provider, see:

- [Viewing metrics and logs from Azure](monitoring_from_azure)
- [Viewing metrics and logs from AWS](monitoring_from_aws)

For details on the types and format of metrics available from BigAnimal see:

- [Metrics details](metrics)

For existing Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) users who want to monitor BigAnimal clusters alongside self-managed Postgres clusters, you can use the remote monitoring capability of PEM. For more information on using PEM to monitor your clusters, see [Remote monitoring](/pem/latest/pem_admin/02a_pem_remote_monitoring).
