With BigAnimal, you have a few options for monitoring and logging solutions:

- You can view metrics and logs from your cloud provider. For more information about viewing metrics and logs from your cloud provider, see:

  - [Viewing metrics and logs from Azure](monitoring_from_azure)

  - [Viewing metrics and logs from AWS](monitoring_from_aws)

  For details on the types and format of metrics available from BigAnimal in your cloud provider, see [Metrics details](metrics).

- BigAnimal provides a Prometheus-compatible endpoint you can use to connect to your own metrics infrastructure such as your AWS Managed Grafana. It also provides the option to view logs from your cloud provider's blob storage solution. For more information, see [Other monitoring and logging solutions](other_monitoring). 

- Existing Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) users who want to monitor BigAnimal clusters alongside self-managed Postgres clusters can use the remote monitoring capability of PEM. See [Remote monitoring](/pem/latest/pem_admin/02a_pem_remote_monitoring). 

  With remote monitoring, you have access to many PEM features, including the ability to profile the workloads on your BigAnimal clusters. See [profile workloads](/pem/latest/profiling_workloads) for more information.
