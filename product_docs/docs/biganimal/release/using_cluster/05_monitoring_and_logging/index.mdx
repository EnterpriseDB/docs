With BigAnimal, you have a few options for monitoring and logging solutions:

- If you're using your own cloud, the default observability solution is viewing metrics and logs from your cloud service provider. For more information about viewing metrics and logs from your cloud provider, see:

  - [Viewing metrics and logs from Azure](monitoring_from_azure)

  - [Viewing metrics and logs from AWS](monitoring_from_aws)

  For details on the types and format of metrics available from BigAnimal in your cloud provider, see [Metrics details](metrics).

- BigAnimal provides a Prometheus-compatible endpoint you can use to connect to your own metrics infrastructure, such as your AWS Managed Grafana. It also provides the option to view logs from your cloud provider's blob storage solution. For more information, see [Other monitoring and logging solutions](other_monitoring). This ability is an optional solution when you're using your own cloud account but is the only option when using BigAnimal's cloud account.

- BigAnimal provides another Prometheus-compatible endpoint PEMx, that you can use to consolidate and expose metrics in each data-plane. PEMx is an integrated monitoring and alerting solution within BigAnimal. It is specially designed to monitor performance of the Postgres clusters. See [PEMx monitoring]() for more information.

- Existing Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) users who want to monitor BigAnimal clusters alongside self-managed Postgres clusters can use the remote monitoring capability of PEM. See [Remote monitoring](/pem/latest/monitoring_performance/pem_remote_monitoring/). 

  With remote monitoring, you have access to many PEM features, including the ability to profile the workloads on your BigAnimal clusters. See [Profiling workloads](/pem/latest/profiling_workloads) for more information.
