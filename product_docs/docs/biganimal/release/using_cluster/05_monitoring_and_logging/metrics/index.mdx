BigAnimal collects a wide set of metrics about Postgres instances and makes them available in your cloud provider. Most of these metrics are acquired directly from Postgres system tables, views, and functions. The Postgres documentation is the main reference for these metrics.

Some data from Postgres monitoring system views, tables, and functions is transformed to be easier to consume in Prometheus metrics format. For example, timestamp fields are generally converted to Unix epoch time and can be accompanied by a relative time-interval metric. Other metrics are aggregated into categories by label dimensions to limit the number of very specific and narrowly scoped individual metrics emitted. It isn't useful to report the inactivity period of every single backend, for example, so backend statistics are aggregated by database, user, `application_name`, and backend state.

The number of tables in your database affects the number of metrics in your cloud logging platform, thus
affecting your cloud provider costs for storing these metrics. To ensure stability of the metrics pipeline, metrics might be dropped when the number of tables in your database exceeds 2500.

Prometheus [labels](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/#labels) are included in the `$.Message.labels` JSON object. Dimensions vary depending on the individual metric and are documented separately for each group of related metrics.

The available set of metrics is subject to change. Metrics might be added, removed, or renamed. Where possible, we change the metric name when changing the meaning or type of existing metrics.

| `state` | State of the group of backends (pg\_stat\_activity.state) |

## `cnp_backends_waiting`

Postgres instance-level aggregate information on backends that are blocked
waiting for locks. Doesn't count I/O waits or other reasons backends might
wait or be blocked.

Derived from the `pg_locks` view.

| Metric   | Usage | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|

## `cnp_pg_database`

Per-database metrics for each database in the Postgres instance.
Includes per-database vacuum progress information.

Derived from the `pg_database` catalog.

Derived from the `pg_postmaster_start_time()` function.

| Metric   | Usage | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `cnp_pg_postmaster_start_time` | GAUGE | Time at which postgres started (based on epoch) |

## `cnp_pg_replication`

Physical replication details for a standby replica postgres instance
as captured from the standby replica.

Derived from the `pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp()` function.

Relevant only on standby replicas.

See also [cnp_pg_stat_replication](#cnp_pg_stat_replication), [cnp_pg_replication_slots](#cnp_pg_replication_slots).

| Metric   | Usage | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `cnp_pg_replication_lag` | GAUGE | Replication lag behind primary in seconds |
| `cnp_pg_replication_in_recovery` | GAUGE | Whether the instance is in recovery |

## `cnp_pg_replication_slots`

Details about replication slots on a Postgres instance. In most
configurations, only the primary server has active replication clients,
but other nodes can still have replication slots.

Logical replication slots are specific to a database, whereas
physical replication slots have an empty "database" label as they
apply to the Postgres instance as a whole.

Derived from the `pg_replication_slots` view.

See also [cnp_pg_stat_replication](#cnp_pg_stat_replication), [cnp_pg_replication](#cnp_pg_replication).

## `cnp_pg_stat_archiver`

Progress information about WAL archiving. Only the currently active primary
server generally performs WAL archiving.

WAL archiving is important for backup and restore. If WAL archiving is
delayed or failing for too long, the point-in-time recovery backups for
a Postgres cluster won't be up to date. This condition has disaster recovery
implications and can potentially also affect failover.

Occasional WAL archiving failures are normal, but pay attention to a growing delay in the time
since the last successful WAL archiving operation.

The following metrics are reset when a Postgres stats reset is issued
on the db server.

Derived from the `pg_stat_archiver` view.

| Metric   | Usage | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `cnp_pg_stat_archiver_archived_count` | COUNTER | Number of WAL files that have been successfully archived |
| `cnp_pg_stat_archiver_failed_count` | COUNTER | Number of failed attempts for archiving WAL files |

| `cnp_pg_stat_archiver_last_failed_wal_start_lsn` | GAUGE | Last failed WAL LSN |
| `cnp_pg_stat_archiver_stats_reset_time` | GAUGE | Time at which these statistics were last reset |

## `cnp_pg_stat_bgwriter`

Stats for the Postgres background writer and checkpointer processes, which
are instance-wide and shared across all databases in a Postgres instance.

Very long delays between checkpoints on a busy system increase the time
taken for it to return to read/write availability if crash recovery is
required. Excessively frequent checkpoints can increase I/O load and the size
of the WAL stream for backup and replication.

The Postgres documentation discusses checkpoints, dirty writeback, and
checkpoint tuning in detail.

These metrics are reset when a Postgres stats reset is issued
on the db server.

Derived from the `pg_stat_bgwriter` catalog.

| `cnp_pg_stat_bgwriter_checkpoint_sync_time` | COUNTER | Total amount of time that has been spent in the portion of checkpoint processing where files are synchronized to disk, in milliseconds |
| `cnp_pg_stat_bgwriter_buffers_checkpoint` | COUNTER | Number of buffers written during checkpoints |

| `cnp_pg_stat_bgwriter_buffers_backend_fsync` | COUNTER | Number of times a backend had to execute its own fsync call (normally the background writer handles those even when the backend does its own write) |
| `cnp_pg_stat_bgwriter_buffers_alloc` | COUNTER | Number of buffers allocated |

## `cnp_pg_stat_database`

own `pg_stat_database` view. It contains statistical counters maintained by
Postgres for database activity.

## Other metrics streams

In addition to Postgres metrics from the Cloud Native PostgreSQL operator that
manages databases in BigAnimal, you can stream metrics about Kubernetes cluster
state and other details to your cloud platform. Any such metrics
are generally well-known metrics from widely used tools, documented by the
upstream vendor of the component.

Refer to the documentation of the tool or project that defines the
metrics for details on individual metrics.

See also [Kubernetes cluster metrics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/system-metrics/).

The cloud platform can supply additional streams of metrics
directly to your metrics, analytics, and dashboarding endpoint.
