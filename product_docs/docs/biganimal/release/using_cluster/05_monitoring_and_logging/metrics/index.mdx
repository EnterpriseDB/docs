BigAnimal collects a wide set of metrics about Postgres instances and makes them available
in your Cloud Provider. Most of these metrics are acquired directly from Postgres system tables,
views, and functions. The Postgres documentation serves as the main reference for these metrics.

Some data from Postgres monitoring system views, tables, and functions are
transformed to be easier to consume in Prometheus metrics format. For example,
timestamp fields are generally converted to Unix epoch time and can be accompanied
by a relative time-interval metric. Other metrics are aggregated into
categories by label dimensions to limit the number of very specific and
narrowly scoped individual metrics emitted. It is not very useful to
report the inactivity period of every single backend, for example, so backend
statistics are aggregated by database, user, `application_name`, and backend
state.

Prometheus [labels](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/#labels)
are included in the $.Message.labels JSON object.
Dimensions vary depending on the individual metric and are documented
separately for each group of related metrics.

The available set of metrics is subject to change. Metrics might be added,
removed or renamed. Where feasible, an effort will be made not to change the
meaning or type of existing metrics without also changing the metric name.

#### Group `cnp_pg_replication`

Physical replication details for a standby postgres instance
as captured from the standby.

Derived from the `pg_last_xact_replay_timestamp()` function.

Relevant only on standby servers.

See also `cnp_pg_stat_replication`, `cnp_pg_replication_slots`.

##### Metrics

| `cnp_pg_replication_lag`         | GAUGE | Replication lag behind primary in seconds |
| `cnp_pg_replication_in_recovery` | GAUGE | Whether the instance is in recovery       |

#### Group `cnp_pg_replication_slots`

Details about replication slots on a postgres instance. In most
configurations, only the primary server has active replication clients,
but other nodes can still have replication slots.

Logical replication slots are specific to a database, whereas
physical replication slots have an empty "database" label as they
apply to the postgres instance as a whole.

Derived from the `pg_replication_slots` view.

See also `cnp_pg_stat_replication`, `cnp_pg_replication`.

| ----------- | ---------------------------- |
| `slot_name` | Name of the replication slot |
| `database`  | Name of the database         |

#### Group `cnp_pg_stat_archiver`

Progress information about WAL archiving. Only the currently active primary
server generally performs WAL archiving.

WAL archiving is important for backup and restore. If WAL archiving is
delayed or failing for too long, the point-in-time recovery backups for
a postgres cluster will not be up to date. This condition has disaster recovery
implications and can potentially also affect failover.

Occasional WAL archiving failures are normal, but a growing delay in the time
since the last successful WAL archiving operation should be taken seriously.

Metrics in this section are reset when a postgres stats reset is issued
on the db server.

Derived from the `pg_stat_archiver` view.

##### Metrics

| Metric                                             | Usage   | Description                                          |

| `cnp_pg_stat_archiver_seconds_since_last_failure`  | GAUGE   | Seconds since the last failed archival operation     |
| `cnp_pg_stat_archiver_last_archived_time`          | GAUGE   | Epoch of the last time WAL archiving succeeded       |
| `cnp_pg_stat_archiver_last_failed_time`            | GAUGE   | Epoch of the last time WAL archiving failed          |
| `cnp_pg_stat_archiver_last_archived_wal_start_lsn` | GAUGE   | Archived WAL start LSN                               |
| `cnp_pg_stat_archiver_last_failed_wal_start_lsn`   | GAUGE   | Last failed WAL LSN                                  |
| `cnp_pg_stat_archiver_stats_reset_time`            | GAUGE   | Time when these statistics were last reset           |

#### Group `cnp_pg_stat_bgwriter`

Stats for the postgres background writer and checkpointer processes, which
are instance-wide and shared across all databases in a postgres instance.

Very long delays between checkpoints on a busy system increase the time
taken for it to return to read/write availability if crash recovery is
required. Excessively frequent checkpoints can increase I/O load and the size
of the WAL stream for backup and replication.

The postgres documentation discusses checkpoints, dirty writeback, and
checkpoint tuning in detail.

Metrics in this section are reset when a postgres stats reset is issued
on the db server.

Derived from the `pg_stat_bgwriter` catalog.

| `cnp_pg_stat_bgwriter_maxwritten_clean`      | COUNTER | Number of times the background writer stopped a cleaning scan because it wrote too many buffers                                                     |

#### Group `cnp_pg_stat_database_conflicts`

These metrics provide information on conflicts between queries on a standby
and the standby's replay of the change-stream from the primary. These are
called recovery conflicts.

multi-master replication row conflicts. They are relevant only on standby
servers.

Metrics in this section are reset when a postgres stats reset is issued
on the db server.

Only defined on standby servers.

Derived from the `pg_stat_database_conflicts` view.

on the db server. The "stat" in the name is a historic artifact from postgres
development.

#### Group `cnp_pg_settings`

Expose the subset of postgres server settings that can be represented as
Prometheus compatible metrics–any integer, boolean, or real number.
Text-format settings, list-valued settings, and enumeration-typed settings are
not captured or reported.

This set of metrics does not expose per-database settings assigned with
`ALTER DATABASE ... SET ...`, per-user settings assigned with `ALTER USER ...
SET ...`, or per-session values. It shows only the database-system-wide
global values. You can explore other settings interactively using postgres
system views.

Derived from the `pg_settings` view.

This group of metrics can have these labels:

### Other metrics streams

In addition to postgres metrics from the Cloud Native PostgreSQL operator that
manages databases in BigAnimal, you can stream additional metrics about Kubernetes cluster
state and other details to your Cloud Platform. Any such metrics
are generally well-known metrics from widely used tools, documented by the
upstream vendor of the component.

Details on individual metrics from such sources are not listed in this
document. Refer to the documentation of the tool or project that defines the
metrics.

See also:

-   [Kubernetes cluster metrics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/system-metrics/).

The cloud platform can supply additional streams of metrics
directly to your metrics, analytics, and dashboarding endpoint.
