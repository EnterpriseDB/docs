title: "Metrics details"
---

The BigAnimal instances collects a variety of metrics and makes them available
to your Azure subscription for dashboarding, alerting, querying, and
other analytics.

See [Monitoring and logging](../05_monitoring_and_logging) for an introduction to
the available monitoring capabilities.

You can find and interpret the available metrics and logs.

## Understanding BigAnimal logs and metrics

You can see example queries over these metrics by editing the predefined
dashboard panels in the default shared dashboard. Some predefined queries
and functions might also be available in the Log Analytics queries panel.
The Azure Monitor Metrics Explorer provides a useful entry point for
discovering the available metrics.

For details on querying these metrics, refer to the Azure Log Analytics and Azure Monitor
documentation and to the documentation on the Kusto query language used by
Azure Monitor. A wide variety of analytics capabilities are available, including
time-series functions, seasonally adjusted statistics, and alert generation.

## Available logs and metrics

The following tables in the Customer Log Analytic workspace contain entries
specific to BigAnimal:

| Table name           | Description                                                                                                     |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| PostgresLogs_CL      | Logs of the Customer clusters databases (all postgres related logs)                                             |
| PostgresAuditLogs_CL | Audit Logs of the Customer clusters databases, if enabled                                                       |
| DpMetrics_CL         | Metrics streams from BigAnimal Prometheus.                                                                      |

You can use the KQL Query editor in the Log Workspace view to compose queries
over these tables.

## Logs

Postgres logs are added to the `PostgresLogs_CL` table.

Logs are split into structured fields matching those of the Postgres
[csvlog format](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-LOGGING-CSVLOG)
with a `record_` prefix and a type-suffix. For example, the `application_name`
is in the `record_application_name_s` log field.

The `pg_cluster_id_s` field identifies the specific Postgres cluster
that originated the log message.

## Metrics overview

BigAnimal collects a wide set of metrics about Postgres instances into the
`DpMetrics_CL` log analytics table. Most of these metrics are acquired
directly from Postgres system tables, views, and functions. The Postgres
documentation serves as the main reference for these metrics.

You can use KQL to analyze time-series metrics, report latest samples of
metrics, and so on by querying the `DpMetrics_CL` table.

Some data from Postgres monitoring system views, tables, and functions are
transformed to be easier to consume in Prometheus metrics format. For example,
timestamp fields are generally converted to Unix epoch time and can be accompanied
by a relative time-interval metric. Other metrics are aggregated into
categories by label dimensions to limit the number of very specific and
narrowly scoped individual metrics emitted. It is not very useful to
report the inactivity period of every single backend, for example, so backend
statistics are aggregated by database, user, `application_name`, and backend
state.

Prometheus [labels](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/#labels)
are mapped to Azure metrics
[dimensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics#multi-dimensional-metrics).
Dimensions vary depending on the individual metric and are documented
separately for each group of related metrics.

The forwarded Prometheus metrics use structured JSON fields, particularly the `Message` and `Message.labels` fields.
Effective use of them requires the use of the
[`todynamic()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/parsejsonfunction)
function in queries.

The available set of metrics is subject to change. Metrics might be added,
removed or renamed. Where feasible, an effort will be made not to change the
meaning or type of existing metrics without also changing the metric name.

At time of writing, all metrics forwarded from Prometheus are in the
`DpMetrics_CL` table. This might change in a future release.

Effective use of the available metrics requires an understanding of Azure
time-series data, metrics dimensions, and of the tagging conventions used in
the metrics streams.

### Metrics labels

All Postgres metrics share a common labelling scheme. Entries generally
have at least the following labels:

| Name                         | Description                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| instance                     | IP address of the host the metric originated from             |
| postgresql                   | BigAnimal postgres cluster identifier, e.g., `p-abcdef012345` |
| role                         | Postgres instance role, "primary" or "replica"                |
| datname                      | Postgres database name (where applicable)                     |
| pod                          | k8s pod name                                                  |
| aks_cluster_name             | AKS cluster name                                              |

When querying for labels, for best performance apply filters that don't
require inspection of labels (for example, filters by metric name) before label-based filters.

The `labels` field of a metrics entry is a nested field under the JSON-typed `Message` field.
To query the field for individual values you JSON parse the `Message` field and dot
reference (`m.labels`) the labels property. Some uses of values might require explicit casts
to another type, for example, `tostring(...)`.

Example usage:

```
DpMetrics_CL
| where Message has "cnp_"
| extend m = todynamic(Message)
| where m.labels.role == "primary"
| project postgres_cluster_id = tostring(m.labels.postgresql), metric_name = m.name, metric_value = m.value
```

#### Group `cnp_pg_stat_archiver`

Progress information about WAL archiving. Only the currently active primary
server generally performs WAL archiving.

WAL archiving is important for backup and restore. If WAL archiving is
delayed or failing for too long, the point-in-time recovery backups for
a postgres cluster will not be up to date. This condition has disaster recovery
implications and can potentially also affect failover.

Occasional WAL archiving failures are normal, but a growing delay in the time
since the last successful WAL archiving operation should be taken seriously.

Metrics in this section are reset when a postgres stats reset is issued
on the db server.

Derived from the `pg_stat_archiver` view.

##### Metrics

| Metric                                             | Usage   | Description                                          |

#### Group `cnp_pg_stat_bgwriter`

Stats for the postgres background writer and checkpointer processes, which
are instance-wide and shared across all databases in a postgres instance.

Very long delays between checkpoints on a busy system increase the time
taken for it to return to read/write availability if crash recovery is
required. Excessively frequent checkpoints can increase I/O load and the size
of the WAL stream for backup and replication.

The postgres documentation discusses checkpoints, dirty writeback, and
checkpoint tuning in detail.

Metrics in this section are reset when a postgres stats reset is issued
on the db server.

Derived from the `pg_stat_bgwriter` catalog.

#### Group `cnp_pg_stat_database_conflicts`

These metrics provide information on conflicts between queries on a standby
and the standby's replay of the change-stream from the primary. These are
called recovery conflicts.

These metrics are unrelated to "INSERT ... ON CONFLICT" conflicts or
multi-master replication row conflicts. They are relevant only on standby
servers.

Metrics in this section are reset when a postgres stats reset is issued
on the db server.

Only defined on standby servers.

#### Group `cnp_pg_settings`

Expose the subset of postgres server settings that can be represented as
Prometheus compatible metrics–any integer, boolean, or real number.
Text-format settings, list-valued settings, and enumeration-typed settings are
not captured or reported.

This set of metrics does not expose per-database settings assigned with
`ALTER DATABASE ... SET ...`, per-user settings assigned with `ALTER USER ...
SET ...`, or per-session values. It shows only the database-system-wide
global values. You can explore other settings interactively using postgres
system views.

Derived from the `pg_settings` view.

### Other metrics streams

In addition to postgres metrics from the Cloud Native PostgreSQL operator that
manages databases in BigAnimal, you can stream additional metrics about Kubernetes cluster
state and other details to the Log Workspace. Any such metrics
are generally well-known metrics from widely used tools, documented by the
upstream vendor of the component.

Details on individual metrics from such sources are not listed in this
document. Refer to the documentation of the tool or project that defines the
metrics.

See also:

-   [Kubernetes cluster metrics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/system-metrics/).

The cloud platform can supply additional streams of metrics
directly to your metrics, analytics, and dashboarding endpoint.

### Dive deeper

Other capabilities available in the Azure portal, outside the scope of this documentation, include the ability to:

-   Discover metrics in the Azure Monitor Metrics Explorer (**Monitor > Metrics**)
-   Query logs and metrics from the Azure Monitor Logs view (**Monitor > Logs**)
-   Create dashboards backed by metrics queries in the Portal
-   Define alerting rules to trigger notifications based on queries
-   Use AI-assisted analytics assistant capabilities ("Metrics Advisers") to find
    patterns in metrics
-   Apply complex analytic tools for time-series data in Application Insights,
    including seasonally adjusted statistics to discover patterns, anomalies, and
    trends.
