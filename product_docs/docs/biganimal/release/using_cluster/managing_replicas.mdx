## Create a faraway replica

You can create faraway replicas in different active regions in your cloud. There is no limit on the number of faraway replicas each cluster can have. However, the added resources and data transfers can increase your cloud costs.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the **Create Replica** icon next to a cluster to create its faraway replica. The Create Faraway Replica page appears.   

1. You can't edit the **Cloud Provider** field. The cloud provider is inherited from the source cluster. Move to the Cluster Settings tab.

1. On the Cluster Settings tab, enter a name for your replica in the **Cluster Name** field.

1. Enter a password for your replica in the **Password** field. 

1. Skip the **Database Type** section. The database information is inherited from the source cluster and you can't edit it.

1. In the **Region** section, select an active region where you want to deploy your replica.
 
1.  Select the instance type in the **Instance Type** section. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on instance type settings.

1.  Select the storage settings in the **Storage** section. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on the storage settings.
 
1.  In the **Networking** section, specify whether to use private or public networking. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on the Networking settings.

1. On the DB Configuration tab, to avoid replication issues when running a replica (standby server), keep the inherited value or increase it for the following database configuration parameters. 
   - max_connections

   - max_locks_per_transaction
   - max_prepared_transactions
   - max_wal_senders
   - max_worker_processes

1. On the Additional Settings tab, in the **Backups** section, change the default replica backup retention period of 30 days using the **Retention Time** controls. You can configure the retention period as follows:
   - 1 - 180 days

   - 1 - 25 weeks
   - 1 - 6 months

1. Enable Identity and Access Management (IAM) Authentication to turn on the ability to log in to Postgres using your AWS IAM credentials. See [Authentication](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#authentication).

1. Select **Create Replica**. 


## Promote a faraway replica

You can promote a faraway replica to a full-fledged cluster, which makes it capable of accepting writes. The new cluster created is different from the source cluster, and it doesn't replace the source cluster.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the cluster with the replica you want to promote. In the **Overview** tab, you can see the cluster's replicas under **Faraway Replicas**.

1. Select the **Promote Faraway Replica** icon next to the replica you want to promote. The Promote Faraway Replica page appears. 

1. The cluster settings are populated with values inherited from the source cluster. You can edit the cluster settings while creating your cluster. 

   !!! NoteNotes
       - You can promote a faraway replica to a single node or high availability cluster but not to an extreme high availability cluster. 
       - While promoting a replica to a cluster, you can't modify the **Provider** and **Region** fields, the **Database Type** section, or enable read-only workloads.

1. Select **Promote Replica**. 



## Modify a faraway replica

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal portal](https://portal.biganimal.com/).

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the cluster with the replica you want to modify. In the **Overview** tab, you can see the cluster's replicas under **Faraway Replicas**.

1. Select the **Edit Cluster** icon next to the replica you want to modify. The Edit Faraway Replica page appears. 

1. In the **Cluster Settings** tab, in the **Cluster Name** field, enter the name for your replica.

1. In the **Password** field, enter a password for your replica. 
 
   In the **Database Type** section, you can see the Postgres type and Postgres version inherited from the source cluster. You can't edit the Postgres type and Postgres version. 

1. Skip the **Region** section. The region is inherited from the source cluster and you can't modify it. 

1. Select the instance type in the **Instance Type** section. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on instance type settings.

   !!! Note
       To avoid lag during replication, ensure that your replicas' instance type is at least as large as the source cluster's instance type.

1. Select the storage settings in the **Storage** section. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on the storage settings.

   !!! Note
       To avoid lag during replication, ensure that your replicas' storage type is at least as large as the source cluster's storage type.
 
1. In the **Networking** section, you specify whether to use private or public networking. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) for details on the Networking settings.

1. On the DB Configuration tab, to avoid replication issues when running a replica (standby server), set the following database configuration parameters to the same or higher value than on the source cluster (primary server). Otherwise, queries are not allowed in the replica. If you are going to increase these GUC values, we highly recommend you set the same value for all faraway replicas first and then set the value on the source cluster. Conversely, if you're going to decrease these GUC values, we recommend setting the source cluster's value first and then the value for all faraway replicas.
   - max_connections

   - max_locks_per_transaction
   - max_prepared_transactions
   - max_wal_senders
   - max_worker_processes

1. Select **Save**. 

## Restore a replica backup

You can restore a replica backup to a standalone cluster. A new stand alone cluster is created and initialized with data from the replica backup.

1.  Select the cluster with the replica you want to restore on the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page in the [BigAnimal portal](https://portal.biganimal.com). 

1.  In the **Overview** tab, you can see the cluster's replicas under **Faraway Replicas**. Select the replica.

1.  From **Quick Actions**, select **Restore Replica**.

1.  On the Restore Replica page: 
    1.  Fill in the required fields.
    1.  In the **Source** section, in the **Point in Time Restore** field, select **Now** on the calendar to restore to the last possible recovery point. Or, choose a timestamp to restore further back in time. 
    3.  Review your selections and select **Restore** to begin the restore process.  
4.  The new stand alone cluster is now available on the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page.


## Delete a faraway replica 

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal portal](https://portal.biganimal.com/).

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page. A list of previously created clusters appears.

1. Select the cluster with the replica you want to delete. In the **Overview** tab, you can see the cluster's replicas under **Faraway Replicas**. 

1. Select the replica you want to delete. 

1. Select the **Delete** icon next to the replica. 

1. Confirm that you want to permanently delete the replica. The replica is deleted.

<would be good to have information on what happes to backups and if customer does not have any other replicas/clusters in this region then they should be advised on deleting the region so there is no additional cost of the management plane>
