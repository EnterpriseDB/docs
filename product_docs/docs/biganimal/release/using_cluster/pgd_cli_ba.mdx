When running a distributed high-availability cluster (DHA) on BigAnimal, you can use the [PGD CLI](../../../pgd/latest/cli/) to manage cluster operations, such as switching over write leaders, performing cluster health checks, and viewing various details about nodes, groups, or other aspects of the cluster.

## Installing the PGD CLI 

To [install the PGD CLI](../../../pgd/latest/cli/installing_cli/), replace `<your-token>` with your EDB subscription token in the following command for Debian and Ubuntu machines:

```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/&lt;your-token&gt;/postgres_distributed/setup.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash
sudo apt-get install edb-pgd5-cli
```

or in this command for RHEL, Rocky, AlmaLinux, or Oracle Linux machines:

```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/&lt;your-token&gt;/postgres_distributed/setup.rpm.sh' | sudo -E bash
sudo yum install edb-pgd5-cli
```

## Connecting to your BigAnimal cluster

### Discovering your database connection string

To connect to your DHA BigAnimal cluster via the PGD CLI, you need to [discover the database connection string](../../../pgd/latest/cli/discover_connections/) from your BigAnimal console:

1. Log into the [BigAnimal clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) view.
1. In the filter, set **Cluster Type** to **Distributed High Availability** to show only clusters that work with PGD CLI.
1. Select your cluster.
1. In the view of your cluster, select the **Connect** tab.
1. Copy the read/write URI from the connection info. This is your connection string.

### Using the PGD CLI with your database connection string

!!! Important
PGD does not prompt for interactive passwords. Accordingly, you should have a [`.pgpass` file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html) properly configured to allow access to the cluster. Your BigAnimal cluster's connection information page has all the necessary information needed for the file. 

Without a properly configured `.pgpass`, you receive a database connection error when using a PGD CLI command, even when using the correct database connection string with the `--dsn` flag.
!!!

To use the PGD CLI with your database connection string, use the `--dsn` flag with your PGD CLI command:

```bash
pgd show-nodes --dsn "<your_connection_string>"
```

## PGD commands in BigAnimal

!!! Note
There are two EDB Postgres Distributed CLI commands that don't apply to BigAnimal: `create-proxy` and `delete-proxy`.
!!!

What follows are some examples of the most common PGD CLI commands with a BigAnimal cluster.

### `pgd check-health`

`pgd check-health` provides statuses with relevant messaging regarding the clock skew of node pairs, node accessibility, the current raft leader, replication slot health, and versioning consistency:

```
$ pgd check-health --dsn "postgres://edb_admin@p-mbx2p83u9n-a.pg.biganimal.io:5432/bdrdb?sslmode=require"

Check      Status  Message                                                    
-----      ------  -------                                                    
ClockSkew  Ok      All BDR node pairs have clockskew within permissible limit 
Connection Ok      All BDR nodes are accessible                               
Raft       Warning There is no RAFT_LEADER, an election might be in progress  
Replslots  Ok      All BDR replication slots are working correctly            
Version    Ok      All nodes are running same BDR versions               
```

### `pgd show-nodes`

`pgd show-nodes` returns all the nodes in the DHA cluster and their summaries, including name, node id, group, and current/target state:

```
$ pgd show-nodes --dsn "postgres://edb_admin@p-mbx2p83u9n-a.pg.biganimal.io:5432/bdrdb?sslmode=require"

Node             Node ID    Group          Type Current State Target State Status Seq ID 
----             -------    -----          ---- ------------- ------------ ------ ------ 
p-mbx2p83u9n-a-1 3537039754 dc1            data ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     1      
p-mbx2p83u9n-a-2 3155790619 p-mbx2p83u9n-a data ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     2      
p-mbx2p83u9n-a-3 2604177211 p-mbx2p83u9n-a data ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     3      
```

### `pgd show-groups`

`pgd show-groups` returns all groups in your DHA BigAnimal cluster. It also notes which node is the current write leader of each group:


```
$ pgd show-groups --dsn "postgres://edb_admin@p-mbx2p83u9n-a.pg.biganimal.io:5432/bdrdb?sslmode=require"

Group          Group ID   Type   Parent Group   Location Raft  Routing Write Leader     
-----          --------   ----   ------------   -------- ----  ------- ------------     
world          3239291720 global                         true  true    p-mbx2p83u9n-a-1 
dc1            4269540889 data   p-mbx2p83u9n-a          false false                    
p-mbx2p83u9n-a 2800873689 data   world                   true  true    p-mbx2p83u9n-a-3 
```
