When running a distributed high-availability cluster on BigAnimal, you can use the [PGD CLI](../../../pgd/latest/cli/) to manage cluster operations, such as switching over write leaders, performing cluster health checks, and viewing various details about nodes, groups, or other aspects of the cluster.

Using the PGD CLI with BigAnimal requires installing it on a client machine, so [install the CLI](../../../pgd/latest/cli/installing_cli/) if you haven't already.

## Connecting to your BigAnimal cluster

### Discovering your database connection string

To connect to your distributed high-availability BigAnimal cluster via the PGD CLI, you need to [discover the database connection string](../../../pgd/latest/cli/discover_connections/) from your BigAnimal console:

1. Log into the [BigAnimal clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) view.
1. In the filter, set **Cluster Type** to **Distributed High Availability** to show only clusters that work with PGD CLI.
1. Select your cluster.
1. In the view of your cluster, select the **Connect** tab.
1. Copy the read/write URI from the connection info. This is your connection string.

### Using the PGD CLI with your database connection string

To use the PGD CLI with your database connection string, use the `--dsn` flag with your PGD CLI command:

```bash
pgd show-nodes --dsn "<your_connection_string>"
```

See the [PGD CLI command reference](../../../pgd/latest/cli/command_ref/) for the full range of PGD CLI commands and their descriptions. 

!!! Important
Your database connection string does not contain the password for your BigAnimal cluster. So, you should have a [`.pgpass` file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html) properly configured to allow access to the cluster. Your BigAnimal cluster's connection information page has all the necessary information needed for the file. 

Without a properly configured `.pgpass`, you receive a database connection error when using a PGD CLI command, even when using the correct database connection string with the `--dsn` flag.
