BigAnimal lets you run Oracle SQL queries in the cloud via [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/epas_compat_ora_dev_guide/). This topic demonstrates two Oracle SQL-syntax queries running unmodified on a BigAnimal test cluster, populated with the [Chinook sample database](https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database).

Watch the video, or load up psql and follow along below!

## Connecting to the demo cluster with psql

You can use any recent version of psql to connect to EDB Postgres Advanced Server. If you choose to use the version that ships with Advanced Server, you'll get a few nice SQL\*Plus compatibility features (with more availability in [EDB\*Plus](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/edb_plus/)). The queries and commands that we'll examine here will work the same in either version of psql. For convenience, these examples use the version of psql available in Azure's Cloud Shell; you can launch this directly from the Azure portal, or on your desktop using Windows Terminal:

```shell
Welcome to Azure Cloud Shell

Type "az" to use Azure CLI
Type "help" to learn about Cloud Shell

$
```

The connection string for the demo Advanced Server cluster looks like this:

```
postgres://demo:password@p-c64p9a3h5vfavr7tfrjg.qsbilba3hlgp1vqr.biganimal.io:5432/chinook?sslmode=require
```

In case you're unfamiliar with [PostgreSQL connection URIs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#id-1.7.3.8.3.6), let's break that down:

- `demo` is the user role we're connecting as. This is a user set up with select privileges on the database.
- `password` is the password for this user.
  !!! Warning Passwords in connection strings.
  This example illustrates a complete connection URL, including the password. This is fine for a demonstration,
  and may also be acceptable for applications configuration if access to the configuration is limited.
  Avoid this practice for admin, superuser, or other roles used interactively - psql will prompt for a password
  if none is supplied.
- `p-c64p9a3h5vfavr7tfrjg.qsbilba3hlgp1vqr.biganimal.io` is the host name for the Advanced Server cluster on BigAnimal that I'm connecting to.
- `5432` is the usual PostgreSQL port number.
- `chinook` is the name of the database.
- `sslmode=require` ensures that we establish a secure connection.

With that in hand, we can launch psql:

```shell
psql postgres://demo:password@p-c64p9a3h5vfavr7tfrjg.qsbilba3hlgp1vqr.biganimal.io:5432/chinook?sslmode=require
__OUTPUT__
psql (13.0 (Debian 13.0-1.pgdg100+1), server 13.4.8 (Debian 13.4.8-1+deb10))
WARNING: psql major version 13, server major version 13.
         Some psql features might not work.

```

Let's take a look at the schema:

```
\dt
__OUTPUT__

 sys    | dual                                | table | postgres
 ...
```

There's an employee table, let's examine its definition:

```
\d+ employee

                                              Table "public.employee"

...
```

This table has a "reportsto" field - that means this is a hierarchical reporting structure, with some employees reporting to
other employees who may in turn report to still *other* employees.

## Demo #1: exposing an organization hierarchy with `CONNECT BY`

Let's construct a [hierarchical query](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/epas_compat_ora_dev_guide/03_advanced_concepts/05_hierarchical_queries/) to expose this [chain of command](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain_of_command).

Modern SQL would use a recursive CTE for this, as those are widely supported. But Oracle has, for decades, supported an alternative mechanism for querying hierarchy in the form of `CONNECT BY` - let's put that into action:

```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, (
	SELECT LISTAGG(lastname, ', ')
	FROM employee rt
	START WITH rt.employeeid=e.reportsto
	CONNECT BY employeeid = PRIOR reportsto
	) AS "chain of command"
FROM employee e;
__OUTPUT__
 firstname | lastname | chain of command
-----------+----------+------------------
 Andrew    | Adams    |
 Nancy     | Edwards  | Adams
 Jane      | Peacock  | Edwards, Adams
 Margaret  | Park     | Edwards, Adams
 Steve     | Johnson  | Edwards, Adams
 Michael   | Mitchell | Adams
 Robert    | King     | Mitchell, Adams
 Laura     | Callahan | Mitchell, Adams
(8 rows)
```
Here, we use `CONNECT BY` and the `LISTAGG` function in a subquery to generate the chain of command for each employee: who they report to, who *that* person reports to, etc.

Now, the `LISTAGG()` function was introduced in Oracle 11g Release 2. Very few database systems support it. PostgreSQL *does* support [`string_agg()`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html#id-1.5.8.27.5.2.4.18.1.1.1), and in the previous example that could be used as a drop-in replacement...

```sql
SELECT firstname, lastname, (
	SELECT string_agg(lastname, ', ')
	FROM employee rt
	START WITH rt.employeeid=e.reportsto
	CONNECT BY employeeid = PRIOR reportsto
	) AS "chain of command"
FROM employee e;
__OUTPUT__
 firstname | lastname | chain of command
-----------+----------+------------------
 Andrew    | Adams    |
 Nancy     | Edwards  | Adams
 Jane      | Peacock  | Edwards, Adams
 Margaret  | Park     | Edwards, Adams
 Steve     | Johnson  | Edwards, Adams
 Michael   | Mitchell | Adams
 Robert    | King     | Mitchell, Adams
 Laura     | Callahan | Mitchell, Adams
(8 rows)
```

But [the semantics of the two functions are different for even slightly less-trivial uses](https://www.enterprisedb.com/blog/how-workaround-oracle-listagg-function-postgresql), specifically when using the grouping construct.

Let's demonstrate that.

## Demo #2: group concatenation with `LISTAGG`

As we saw above, this database has "album" and "track" tables containing metadata on digital recordings. We can use some analytic functions, including `LISTAGG`, to put together a report on average track storage requirements for albums with "baby" in the title.

```sql
SELECT UNIQUE title,
       ROUND(AVG(bytes) OVER (PARTITION BY mediatypeid)/1048576 ) media_avg_mb,
       LISTAGG(t.name || ' (' || ROUND(bytes/1048576) || ' mb)', chr(10))
         WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY trackid)
         OVER (PARTITION BY title)  track_list
FROM track t
JOIN album USING (albumid)
JOIN mediatype USING (mediatypeid)
WHERE lower(title) LIKE '%baby%'
ORDER BY title;
__OUTPUT__
    title     | media_avg_mb |                    track_list
--------------+--------------+---------------------------------------------------
 Achtung Baby |            9 | Zoo Station (9 mb)                               +
              |              | Even Better Than The Real Thing (7 mb)           +
              |              | One (9 mb)                                       +
              |              | Until The End Of The World (9 mb)                +
              |              | Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses (10 mb)        +
              |              | So Cruel (11 mb)                                 +
              |              | The Fly (8 mb)                                   +
              |              | Mysterious Ways (8 mb)                           +
              |              | Tryin' To Throw Your Arms Around The World (7 mb)+
              |              | Ultraviolet (Light My Way) (10 mb)               +
              |              | Acrobat (8 mb)                                   +
              |              | Love Is Blindness (8 mb)
(1 row)
```

If we try replacing `LISTAGG` with `string_agg` in this example, it's going to fail - the [expression syntax for `string_agg`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-expressions.html#SYNTAX-AGGREGATES) is different.

```sql
SELECT UNIQUE title,
       ROUND(AVG(bytes) OVER (PARTITION BY mediatypeid)/1048576 ) media_avg_mb,
       string_agg(t.name || ' (' || ROUND(bytes/1048576) || ' mb)', chr(10))
         WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY trackid)
         OVER (PARTITION BY title)  track_list
FROM track t
JOIN album USING (albumid)
JOIN mediatype USING (mediatypeid)
WHERE lower(title) LIKE '%baby%'
ORDER BY title;
__OUTPUT__
ERROR:  function string_agg(text, text, numeric) does not exist
LINE 3:        string_agg(t.name || ' (' || ROUND(bytes/1048576) || ...
               ^
HINT:  No function matches the given name and argument types. You might need to add explicit type casts.
```

Now, this isn't terribly difficult to correct, but it requires restructuring the query to replace the grouping construct - such work can quickly accumulate errors. Fortunately, [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/)
supports [`LISTAGG`](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/epas_compat_reference/02_the_sql_language/03_functions_and_operators/11_aggregate_functions/#listagg) AND `string_agg`,
so this query doesn't need to change when migrating from Oracle.

## Compatibility preserves the value of your existing work

In both of the examples shown here, you probably would not use the functions and syntax demonstrated for new work; there are
better, more familiar or at least more widely-available equivalents provided natively by PostgreSQL (and many other databases). But by supporting them, EDB Advanced Server gives you the ability to reuse existing logic with minimal modification, allowing
you to focus your time and expertise on solving new problems.
