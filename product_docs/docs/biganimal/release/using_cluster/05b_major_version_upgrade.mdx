navTitle: Upgrading Postgres major versions
---

To upgrade small to moderately large databases (up to several tens of gigabytes) between major versions of Postgres on BigAnimal, we recommend utilizing `pg_dump` to migrate data and populate a new BigAnimal instance/cluster. This method requires downtime, so schedule the `pg_dump` operation accordingly.

## Migrating Postgres versions with `pg_dump`

!!! Important
This procedure accrues ingress and egress costs from your cloud service provider (CSP) for the migrated data. Please consult your CSP's pricing documentation to see how ingress and egress fees are calculated to determine any extra costs.
!!!

### Create a new BigAnimal instance

Using `pg_dump` to migrate between major versions requires creating a new BigAnimal instance of the new version of Postgres. This procedure does not work for upgrading a distributed high-availability BigAnimal instance.

The new instance must have sufficient storage to receive the `pg_dump` from the old instance, so ensure enough storage is provisioned when creating the new instance.

Considering these caveats, [create the new BigAnimal instance](../getting_started/creating_a_cluster.mdx).

### Gather instance information

For this procedure, information obtained from the BigAnimal console is necessary. For both the new instance and the old instance, you need the following:

1. Read/write URI
2. Database name
3. Username 
4. Read/write host

To access this information, select the **Clusters** tab on the left-side navigation menu of the BigAnimal console, find the instance in question, and select it by name. Clusters are listed in alphabetical order.

After selecting the instance in question, navigate to the **Connect** tab under the instance's name on the show page. The information needed for the procedure is listed here under **Connection Info**.

### Confirming the Postgres versions before migration

Next, from a machine with a Postgres client, confirm the current version of Postgres on both the old BigAnimal instance (the instance you are migrating *from*) and the new BigAnimal instance (the instance you are migrating *to*):

```
psql "<biganimal_read/write_uri>" -c "select version();"
```

Example output looks like the following for a version 16 instance:

```
                                                               version                                                               
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PostgreSQL 16.2 (Debian 16.2.0-3.buster) (BigAnimal Edition) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Debian 8.3.0-6) 8.3.0, 64-bit
(1 row)
```

Check that both instances are the expected versions.

### Execute the `pg_dump` command

!!! Warning
Due to two different password authentications (one for the old instance and one for the new instance) entailed when piping the `pg_dump` command to the `psql` command, we recommend that you [setup to utilize pgpass for authentication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/libpq-pgpass.html) before performing the migration using the `pg_dump` command. If you do not, the command prompt may become unresponsive.
https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/libpq-pgpass.html
!!!

Next, execute the `pg_dump` command, filling in the two instances' [relevant information](#gather-instance-information) accordingly: read/write hosts, usernames, and db names.

```bash
pg_dump -h <old_big_animal_read/write_host> -U <old_instance_user_name> -d <old_db_name> | psql -h <new_big_animal_read/write_host> -U <new_instance_username> -d <new_db_name> 
```

!!! Tip
Use the --verbose flag with `pg_dump` to get more detailed output as the command is executed.
!!!

The procedure can take several minutes, even for relatively smaller datasets (<5 GB). Successful example output looks like the following:

```
SET
SET
SET
SET
SET
 set_config 
------------
 
(1 row)

SET

SET
ERROR:  must be able to SET ROLE "postgres"

CREATE TABLE
ALTER TABLE
COPY 20000000
COPY 200
COPY 0
COPY 2000
ALTER TABLE
ALTER TABLE
ALTER TABLE
REVOKE
GRANT
```

There are three errors present here:


```
ERROR:  must be able to SET ROLE "postgres"
```

```
ERROR:  must be owner of extension pg_stat_statements
```

```
ERROR: must be owner of extension pgaudit
```

All three are expected and should not prevent the completion of the upgrade.

### Validate the upgrade

Finally, validate the upgrade by running the following on the new instance:

```
psql "<new_biganimal_read/write_uri>" -c "\dt+;"
```

Compare this output to the output when running the same command on the old instance:

```
psql "<old_biganimal_read/write_uri>" -c "\dt+;"
```

If the upgrade is a success, both the tables and the sizes of those tables are the same between instances. 

!!! Note
This is only a preliminary validation of the upgrade. Perform a more comprehensive testing of application functionalities and performance for a more thorough validation that the database operates as expected.
