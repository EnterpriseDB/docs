title: "Deleting your cluster"
---

If you no longer need a particular cluster, you can delete it from the BigAnimal portal.  You can restore a cluster for up to 30 days after you delete it, but after 30 days the data is permanently deleted. To stop the management costs on the cluster, contact EDB's BigAnimal Support team; otherwise, costs may continue to accumulate.

## Delete your cluster

1.  Go to the [**Clusters**](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page in the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal. 
2.  Do one of the following to delete the cluster:
    -   Select the Delete cluster icon in the row for the cluster.
    -   Select the cluster you wish to delete and from **Quick Actions** on the cluster details page, select **Delete**.
3.  Confirm you want to delete the cluster. When the process completes, the cluster is listed on the **Deleted** tab of the **Clusters** page.
4.  Contact [Support](../overview/support/) to stop the associated management costs. For more information on management costs see [Pricing and billing](../pricing_and_billing/#management-costs).
