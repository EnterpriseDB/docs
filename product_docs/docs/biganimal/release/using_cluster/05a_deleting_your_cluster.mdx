title: "Deleting your cluster"
---

If you no longer need a particular cluster, you can delete it from the BigAnimal portal. You can restore deleted clusters after you delete the cluster for as long as the backup is available. The backup remains available for the retention period set for each cluster. After the retention period, the backup is deleted. 

To stop the management costs on the cluster, contact EDB's BigAnimal Support team, Otherwise, costs might continue to accumulate.

## Delete your cluster

!!! Important
    You can delete a cluster only if you have either promoted or deleted each of its faraway replicas. See [Faraway replicas](/biganimal/latest/overview/replication/).

1.  Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page in the [BigAnimal portal](https://portal.biganimal.com). 
2.  To delete the cluster, do one of the following:
    -   Select the **Delete cluster** icon in the row for the cluster.
    -   Select the cluster you want to delete. From **Quick Actions** on the cluster details page, select **Delete**.
3.  Confirm that you want to delete the cluster. When the process finishes, the cluster is listed on the **Deleted** tab of the Clusters page.
4.  To stop the associated management costs, contact [Support](../overview/support/). For more information on management costs, see [Pricing and billing](../pricing_and_billing/#management-costs).
