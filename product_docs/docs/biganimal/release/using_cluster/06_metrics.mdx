title: "Metrics Details"
---

A variety of metrics are collected by the BigAnimal instance and made available
to the customer's Azure subscription for dashboarding, alerting, querying and
other analytics.

See [Monitoring and Logging](#monitoring-and-logging) for an introduction to
the available monitoring capabilities.

This section explains how to find and interpret the available metrics and logs.
It also lists and describes the individual metrics provided.

## Understanding BigAnimal Logs and Metrics

You can see example queries over these metrics by editing the predefined
dashboard panels in the default shared dashboard. Some pre-defined queries
and/or functions may also be available in the Log Analytics queries panel.
The Azure Monitor Metrics Explorer provides a useful entry point for
discovering the available metrics.

In-depth advice on the details of querying these metrics is beyond the scope of
this documentation. Refer to The Azure Log Analytics and Azure Monitor
documentation and to the documentation on the Kusto query language used by
Azure Monitor. A wide variety of analytics capabilities are available including
time-series functions, seasonally adjusted statistics, alert generation and
more.

## Available Logs and Metrics

The following tables in the _Customer Log Analytic workspace_ contain entries
specific to BigAnimal:

| Table name | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| PostgresLogs_CL  | Logs of the Customer clusters databases (all postgres related logs) |
| PostgresAuditLogs_CL  | Audit Logs of the Customer clusters databases, if enabled |
| InsightsMetrics | Metrics streams from BigAnimal Prometheus and Azure Monitor. BigAnimal metrics have `namespace == "prometheus"` |

You can use the KQL Query editor in the Log Workspace view to compose queries
over these tables.

## Logs

Postgres logs are added to the `PostgresLogs_CL` table.

Logs are split into structured fields matching those of the Postgres
[csvlog format](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html#RUNTIME-CONFIG-LOGGING-CSVLOG)
with a `record_` prefix and a type-suffix. For example the `application_name`
is in the `record_application_name_s` log field.

The `pg_cluster_id_s` field identifies the specific postgres cluster
that originated the log message.

## Metrics Overview

BigAnimal collects a wide set of metrics about postgres instances into the
`InsightsMetrics` log analytics table. Most of these metrics are acquired
directly from postgres system tables, views, and functions. The postgres
documentation serves as the main reference for these metrics.

KQL can be used to analyze time-series metrics, report latest samples of
metrics, etc by querying the `InsightsMetrics` table.

Some data from postgres monitoring system views, tables and functions are
transformed to be easier to consume in Prometheus metrics format. For example,
timestamp fields are generally converted to unix epoch time and/or accompanied
by a relative time-interval metric. Other metrics are aggregated into
categories by label dimensions to limit the number of very specific and
narrowly scoped individual metrics emitted. It would be not be very useful to
report the inactivity period of every single backend, for example, so backend
statistics are aggregated by database, user, `application_name` and backend
state.

Prometheus [Labels](https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/#labels)
are mapped to Azure metrics
[Dimensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/essentials/data-platform-metrics#multi-dimensional-metrics).
Dimensions vary depending on the individual metric, and are documented
separately for each group of related metrics.

The forwarded Prometheus metrics use structured json fields, particularly for
the `Tags` field. Effective use of them will require use of the
[`todynamic()`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/parsejsonfunction)
function in queries.

The available set of metrics is subject to change. Metrics may be added,
removed or renamed. Where feasible an effort will be made not to change the
meaning or type of existing metrics without also changing the metric name.

At time of writing all metrics forwarded from Prometheus are in the
`prometheus` namespace. This may change in a future release.

Effective use of the available metrics will require an understanding of Azure
time-series data, metrics dimensions, and of the tagging conventions used in
the metrics streams.

### Metrics tags

All postgres metrics share a common tagging scheme. Entries will generally
have at least the following tags:

| Name                           | Description |
|--------------------------------|-------------|
| address                        | IP address of the host the metric originated from |
| postgresql                     | BigAnimal postgres cluster identifier e.g. `p-abcdef012345` |
| role                           | Postgres instance role, "primary" or "replica" |
| datname                        | Postgres database name (where applicable) |
| pod_name                       | k8s pod name |
| hostName                       | AKS node host name |
| container.azm.ms/clusterName   | AKS cluster name |

When querying for tags best performance is achieved when any filters that do not
require inspection of tags (e.g. filters by metric name) are applied before any
tag-based filters.

The `Tags` field of a metrics entry is a json-typed field that may be queried
for individual values with `todynamic(Tags).keyname` in KQL. Some uses of values
may require explicit casts to another type e.g. `tostring(...)`.

Example usage:

```
InsightsMetrics
| where Namespace == "prometheus" and Name startswith "cnp_"
| extend t = todynamic(Tags)
| where t.role == "primary"
| project postgres_cluster_id = tostring(t.postgresql), dbname = tostring(t.datname)
| where not (dbname has_any("template0", "template1"))
| distinct postgres_cluster_id, dbname
```

|----------|-------|-------------|
| `cnp_pg_replication_lag` | GAUGE | Replication lag behind primary in seconds |
| `cnp_pg_replication_in_recovery` | GAUGE | Whether the instance is in recovery |

#### Group `cnp_pg_replication_slots`

Details about replication slots on a postgres instance. In most
configurations only the primary server will have active replication clients,
but other nodes may still have replication slots.

Note that logical replication slots are specific to a database, whereas
physical replication slots will have an empty "database" label as they
apply to the postgres instance as a whole.

Derived from the `pg_replication_slots` view.

#### Group `cnp_pg_stat_archiver`

Progress information about WAL archiving. Only the currently active primary
server will generally be performing WAL archiving.

WAL archiving is important for backup and restore. If WAL archiving is
delayed or failing for too long, the point-in-time recovery backups for
a postgres cluster will not be up to date. This has disaster recovery
implications and can potentially also affect failover.

Occasional WAL archiving failures are normal, but a growing delay in the time
since the last successful WAL archiving operation should be taken seriously.

Metrics in this section are reset when a postgres stats reset is issued
on the db server.

Derived from the `pg_stat_archiver` view.

##### Metrics

| Metric   | Usage | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `cnp_pg_stat_archiver_archived_count` | COUNTER | Number of WAL files that have been successfully archived |

#### Group `cnp_pg_stat_bgwriter`

Stats for the postgres background writer and checkpointer processes, which
are instance-wide and shared across all databases in a postgres instance.

Very long delays between checkpoints on a busy system will increase the time
taken for it to return to read/write availability if crash recovery is
required. Excessively frequent checkpoints can increase I/O load and the size
of the WAL stream for backup and replication.

The postgres documentation discusses checkpoints, dirty writeback, and
checkpoint tuning in detail.

Metrics in this section are reset when a postgres stats reset is issued
on the db server.

Derived from the `pg_stat_bgwriter` catalog.

| `cnp_pg_stat_bgwriter_buffers_backend_fsync` | COUNTER | Number of times a backend had to execute its own fsync call (normally the background writer handles those even when the backend does its own write) |
| `cnp_pg_stat_bgwriter_buffers_alloc` | COUNTER | Number of buffers allocated |

#### Group `cnp_pg_stat_database`

This metrics group directly exposes the summary data postgres collects in its
own `pg_stat_database` view. It contains statistical counters maintained by
postgres itself for database activity.

Metrics in this section are reset when a postgres stats reset is issued
on the db server.

### Other metrics streams

In addition to postgres metrics from the Cloud Native PostgreSQL operator that
manages databases in BigAnimal, additional metrics about Kubernetes cluster
state and other details may be streamed to the Log Workspace. Any such metrics
are generally well-known metrics from widely used tools, documented by the
upstream vendor of the component.

Details on individual metrics from such sources will not be listed in this
document. Refer to the documentation of the tool or project that defines the
metrics.

See also:

* [Kubernetes cluster metrics](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/system-metrics/).

Additional streams of metrics may be supplied by the cloud platform itself
directly to the customer's metrics, analytics and dashboarding endpoint.

### Dive Deeper

The capabilities available in the Azure portal are too broad to fully cover in this
documentation. They include the ability to:

* Discover metrics in the Azure Monitor Metrics Explorer (Monitor -> Metrics)
* Query logs and metrics from the Azure Monitor Logs view (Monitor -> Logs)
* Create dashboards backed by metrics queries in the Portal
* Define alerting rules to trigger notifications based on queries
* Use AI-assisted analytics assistant capabilities ("Metrics Advisers") to find
  patterns in metrics
* Apply complex analytic tools for time-series data in Application Insights,
  including seasonally adjusted statistics to discover patterns, anomalies and
  trends.
