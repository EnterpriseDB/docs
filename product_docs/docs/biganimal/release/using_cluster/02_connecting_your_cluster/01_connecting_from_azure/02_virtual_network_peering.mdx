This example shows how to connect using virtual network peering. 

!!! Note
    The IP ranges of two peered virtual networks can't overlap. BigAnimal VNets use the 10.240.0.0/16 address space and cannot be peered with VNets using this same space.

Assume that your cluster is on a subscription called `development` and is being accessed from a Linux client VM on another subscription called `test` with the following properties:

-   Cluster:
    -   Subscription: `development`
    -   Cluster ID: `p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg` 
    -   Account ID: `brcxzr08qr7rbei1` 
    -   Organization's domain name: `biganimal.io` 


-   Linux client VM called `vm-client`:
    -   Subscription: `test`
    -   Resource group: `rg-client`
    -   Virtual network: `vnet-client`
    -   Virtual network subnet: `snet-client`

#### Prerequisites

To walk through an example in your own environment, you need:

-   Your cluster URL. You can find the URL in the **Connect** tab of your cluster instance in the BigAnimal portal.
-   The IP address of your cluster. You can find the IP address of your cluster using the following command:

    ```
    $ dig +short p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg.brcxzr08qr7rbei1.biganimal.io 
    10.240.1.218
    ```
-   A Postgresql client, such as [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), installed on your client VM.

#### Step 1: Create a virtual network peering link

You need to add two peering links, one from the client VM's VNet `vnet-client` and the other from your cluster's VNet `vnet-japaneast`. 

!!! Note
    In this example, you create virtual network peering for virtual networks that belong to subscriptions in the same Azure Active Directory tenants. For steps to create virtual network peering for virtual networks that belong to subscriptions in different Azure Active Directory tenants, see [peering virtual networks from different Azure Active Directory tenants](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-network/create-peering-different-subscriptions).

1.  In the Azure portal, search for *Virtual networks*. When **Virtual networks** appears in the search results, select it. Don't select **Virtual networks (classic)**, as you can't create a peering from a virtual network deployed through the classic deployment model.

2.  Select the client VM's Virtual Network `vnet-client` from the list that you want to create a peering for.

3.  Under **Settings**, select **Peerings** and then select **+ Add**.

4.  From the Peerings page of the client VM's Virtual Network `vnet-client`, add two peering links called `peer-client-edb` and `peer-edb-client` to join the address space of two virtual networks together. 

    To simplify the process, Azure creates both peering links for you when you add peering from either side.

#### Step 2: Access the cluster

Access the cluster with its domain name from your cluster's connection string. It's accessible from `vnet-client` after peering.

```
$ dig +short p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg.brcxzr08qr7rbei1.biganimal.io 
10.240.1.123 
      
$ psql -h p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg.brcxzr08qr7rbei1.biganimal.io -U edb_admin
