There are three different methods to connect to your cluster from your application's virtual network in Azure. Each method offers different levels of accessibility and security. The Azure Private Endpoint method is recommended and is most commonly used; however, you can implement either of the other solutions depending on your organization's requirements.

- [Virtual network peering](#virtual-network-peering)
- [Azure VNet-VNet connection](#azure-vnet-vnet-connection)

## Azure Private Endpoint (recommended)

 Azure Private Endpoint is a network interface that securely connects a private IP 
 address from your Azure Virtual Network (VNet) to an external service. You only grant access to a single cluster instead of the entire BigAnimal resource virtual network, thus ensuring maximum network isolation. Private Endpoints are the same mechanism used by first-party Azure services such as CosmosDB for private VNet connectivity. For more information, see [What is an Azure Private Endpoint?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-endpoint-overview).

**Pros**
 - The Private Link only needs to be configured once, then multiple Private Links can be used to connect applications from many different VNets.
 - There is no risk of IP address conflicts.

**Cons**
 - Private Links (required by Private Endpoints) are not free. See [Azure Private Link pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/private-link/#pricing).

See the [Private Endpoint Example](01_private_endpoint) for the steps for connecting using this method.

## Virtual network peering

Virtual network peering connects two Azure Virtual Networks, allowing traffic to be freely routed between the two. Once peered, the two virtual networks act as one with respect to connectivity. Network Security Group rules are still observed.

**Pros**
- Simple and easy to set up.

**Cons**
- There is an associated cost. See [pricing for virtual network peering](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/virtual-network/#pricing) for details.
- The IP ranges of two peered virtual networks cannot overlap. BigAnimal VNets use the 10.240.0.0/16 address space and cannot be peered with VNets utilizing this same space.

See the [Viritual Network Peering Example](02_virtual_network_peering) for the steps to connect using this VNet Peering.

## Azure VNet-VNet connection

VNet-VNet connections use VPN gateways to send encrypted traffic between Azure virtual networks.

**Pros**
- Cluster domain name is directly accessible without a NAT. 
- VNets from different subscriptions do not need to be associated with the same Active Directory tenant.

**Cons**
- Bandwidth is limited, see [virtual network gateway planning table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways#planningtable). 
- Configuration is complicated.
- There is an associated cost, see [virtual network gateway planning table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways#planningtable).

See the [VNet-VNet Example](03_vnet_vnet) for the steps for connecting using VNet-VNet Connection.
