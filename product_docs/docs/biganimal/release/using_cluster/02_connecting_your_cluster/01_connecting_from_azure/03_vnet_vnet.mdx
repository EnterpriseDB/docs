These are the steps to connect using VNet-VNet connections. 

To use this method, you need to create [Azure VPN Gateways](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpngateways) in each connected virtual network.  

!!! Note
    VPN gateway creation can take up to 45 minutes. 

Assume that your cluster is on a subscription called `development` and is being accessed from a Linux client VM on another subscription called `test` with the following properties:

- Cluster:
  - Subscription: `development`
  - Cluster ID: `p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg` 
  - Account ID: `brcxzr08qr7rbei1` 
  - Organization's domain name: `biganimal.io` 


- Linux client VM called `vm-client`:
  - Subscription: `test`
  - Resource group: `rg-client`
  - Virtual network: `vnet-client`
  - Virtual network subnet: `snet-client`

#### Prerequisites

To walk through an example in your own environment, you need:

- Your cluster URL. You can find the URL in the **Connect** tab of your cluster instance in the BigAnimal portal.
 
- The IP address of your cluster. You can find the IP address of your cluster using the following command:

 ```
 $ dig +short p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg.brcxzr08qr7rbei1.biganimal.io 
 10.240.1.218
 ```
 
- A Postgresql client, such as [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), installed on your client VM.

#### Step 1: Create a VPN gateway for the cluster's virtual network
  in the search box. Locate "Virtual network gateways" in the search results and select it.

1. On the Virtual network gateways page, select **+ Create**. This opens the **Create virtual network gateway** page.

1. On the **Create virtual network gateway** page, create the VPN gateway for the cluster's resource virtual network `vnet-japaneast`. Name the VPN gateway `vpng-biganimal`.

!!! Note
    The VPN gateway automatically creates a dedicated subnet to accommodate its gateway VMs. Ensure that your cluster's virtual network address space has sufficient IP range for the subnet to prevent errors in the virtual network. For more information, see [Add a subnet](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-network/virtual-network-manage-subnet#add-a-subnet).

#### Step 2: Create a VPN gateway for the client VM virtual network

In the same way, create the gateway for your client VM virtual network `vnet-client`. Name the client VPN gateway `vpng-client`.

#### Step 3: Add a gateway connection between the two VPN gateways

Use the Azure CLI (or [PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-vnet-vnet-rm-ps)) to add a VPN gateway connection from `vpng-biganimal`, as follows:

!!! Note
    The Azure portal only allows you to create VPN gateway connections between virtual networks belonging to the same subscription.

1. Get the VPN gateway ID of `vpng-client`.

 **From the BigAnimal subscription**:

    ```
   $ az network vnet-gateway show -n vpng-biganimal -g brCxzr08qr7RBEi1-rg-japaneast-management --query "[id]" -otsv
   subscriptions/.../vpng-biganimal
   ```

 **From the client VM's subscription**:

   ```
   $ az network vnet-gateway show -n vpng-client -g rg-client --query "[id]" -o tsv
   /subscriptions/.../vpng-client
   ```

2. From the BigAnimal subscription, create a connection from `vpng-biganimal` to `vpng-client`.

  ```
  $ az network vpn-connection create -n vpnc-biganimal-client -g brCxzr08qr7RBEi1-rg-japaneast-management --vnet-gateway1 /subscriptions/.../vpng-biganimal -l japaneast --shared-key "a_very_long_and_complex_psk" \--vnet-gateway2 /subscriptions/.../vpng-client

  ```

 Note down the value for `--shared-key`. It is a PSK for pairing authentication from both sides needed in the next step.

3. From the client VM's subscription, create another connection from `vpng-client` to `vpng-ebdcloud`.

    ```
    $ az network vpn-connection create -n vpnc-client-biganimal -g rg-client --vnet-gateway1 /subscriptions/.../vpng-client -l japaneast --shared-key "a_very_long_and_complex_psk!" --vnet-gateway2 /subscriptions/.../vpng-biganimal
    ```

#### Step 4: Verify the connection

1. After a few minutes, verify the gateway connection status either from either virtual networks with the following command:

 ```
 $ az network vpn-connection show --name vpnc-client-biganimal -g rg-client --query "[connectionStatus]" -o tsv
Connected
 ```

2. Verify the connectivity to the cluster:

 ```
 $ dig +short p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg.brcxzr08qr7rbei1.biganimal.io 
 10.240.1.123 
       
 $ psql -h p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg.brcxzr08qr7rbei1.biganimal.io -U edb_admin
