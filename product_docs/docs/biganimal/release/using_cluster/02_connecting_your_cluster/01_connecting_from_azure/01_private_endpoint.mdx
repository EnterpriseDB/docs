This example shows how to connect your cluster using Azure Private Endpoint. 

Assume that your cluster is on a subscription called `development` and is being accessed from a Linux client VM on another subscription called `test` with the following properties:

-   Cluster:
    -   Subscription: `development`
    -   Cluster ID: `p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg` 
    -   Account ID: `brcxzr08qr7rbei1` 
    -   Organization's domain name: `biganimal.io` 


-   Linux client VM called `vm-client`:
    -   Subscription: `test`
    -   Resource group: `rg-client`
    -   Virtual network: `vnet-client`
    -   Virtual network subnet: `snet-client`


#### Prerequisites

To walk through an example in your own environment, you need:

-   Your cluster URL. You can find the URL in the **Connect** tab of your cluster instance in the BigAnimal portal.
-   The IP address of your cluster. You can find the IP address of your cluster using the following command:

    ```shell
    dig +short p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg.brcxzr08qr7rbei1.biganimal.io 
    __OUTPUT__
    10.240.1.218
    ```
-   A Postgresql client, such as [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), installed on your client VM.

#### Step 1: Create an Azure Private Link service for your cluster

  In this example, you create an [Azure Private Link service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview) in your cluster's resource group. You must perform this procedure for every cluster that you want to connect to in Azure.

1.  Get the resource group details from the Azure CLI or the Azure portal and note the resource group name. For example, if the cluster's virtual network is `vnet-japaneast`, use the following command: 

    ```shell
    az network vnet list --query "[?name==\`vnet-japaneast\`].resourceGroup" -o json

    ```

2.  On the upper-left part of the page in the Azure portal, select **Create a resource**.

3.  In the **Search the Marketplace** box, search for *Private Link*.

4.  Select **Create**.

5.  Enter the details for the Azure Private Link. Use a unique name for the Azure Private Link. 

    For example, `p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg-service-private-link`, where `p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg` is the cluster ID. 

     ![Create private link service](../images/image5.png)

6.  Enter the resource group name from step 1. 

7.  In the **Outbound settings** page, select the `kubernetes-internal` load balancer
     and select the IP address of your cluster in the **Load balancer frontend IP
     address** field. 

     You can get the IP address of your cluster with the following command:

    ```shell
    dig +short p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg.brcxzr08qr7rbei1.biganimal.io 
    __OUTPUT__
    10.240.1.218
    ```

      ![Outbound settings](../images/image1.png)

8.  On the **Access security** page, configure the level of access for the private link service. See [control service exposure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/private-link/private-link-service-overview#control-service-exposure) for details.

    ![](../images/image21.png)  

    !!! Note
        If the required access is not provided to the account or subscription accessing the cluster, you must manually approve the connection request from the **Pending connections** page in **Private Link Center**.


5.  After the private link service is created, note its alias. The alias is the unique ID for your private service, which you can share with the service consumers. Obtain the alias either from the Azure portal or by using the following CLI command:

    ```shell
    az network private-link-service list --query "[?name=='p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg-service-private-link'].alias" -o tsv
    __OUTPUT__
    p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg-service-private-link.48f26b42-45dc-4e80-8e3d-307d58d7d274.japaneast.azure.privatelinkservice
    ```

6.  Select **Review + Create**.

7.  Select **Create**.

#### Step 2: Create an Azure Private Endpoint in each client virtual network

  In this example, you create an Azure Private Endpoint in your client VM's virtual network. After you create the private endpoint, you can use its private IP address to access the cluster. You must perform this procedure for every virtual network you want to connect from.

1.  On the upper-left side of the screen in the Azure portal, select **Create a resource > Networking > Private Link**, or in the search box enter *Private Link*.

2.  Select **Create**.

3.  In Private Link Center, select **Private endpoints** in the menu on the left.

4.  In Private endpoints, select **Add**.

5.  Enter the details for the private endpoint as shown in the following image. Use a unique name for the private endpoint. 

    For example, enter `vnet-client-private-pg-service`, where `vnet-client` is the client VNet ID. 

    !!! Note
        In a later step, you need the private endpoint's name to get its private IP address.

    ![](../images/image12.png)

6.  Connect the private endpoint to the private link service that you created by entering its alias.

    ![](../images/image17.png)

7.  In the **Configuration** page, enter the client VM's Virtual Network `vnet-client`.

8.  Select **Review + Create**.

9.  Select **Create**.

    !!!Note
       If the private endpoint's status appears as **Pending**, your account or subscription might not be authorized to access the private link service. 

       To resolve this issue, the connection must be manually approved from the Pending connections page in Private Link Center, from the BigAnimal Azure subscription.

    !!!


11. You have successfully built a tunnel between your client VM's virtual network and the cluster. You can now access the cluster from the private endpoint in your client VM. The private endpoint's private IP address is associated with an independent virtual network NIC. Get the private endpoint's private IP address using the following commands:

    ```shell
    NICID=$(az network private-endpoint show -n vnet-client-private-pg-service -g rg-client --query "networkInterfaces[0].id" -o tsv)
    az network nic show -n ${NICID##*/} -g rg-client --query "ipConfigurations[0].privateIpAddress" -o tsv
    __OUTPUT__
    100.64.111.5
    ```

12. From the client VM `vm-client`, access the cluster by using the private IP address:

    ```shell
    psql -h 100.64.111.5 -U edb_admin 
    __OUTPUT__
    Password for user edb_admin : 

    psql (13.4 (Ubuntu 13.4-1.pgdg20.04+1), server 13.4.8 (Debian 13.4.8-1+deb10)) 
    WARNING : psql major version 13, server major version 13. Some psql features might not work. 
    SSL connection (protocol : TLSV1.3, cipher : TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits : 256, compression : off) Type "help" for help. 

    edb_admin=>

    ```

#### Step 3: Create an Azure Private DNS Zone for the private endpoint

EDB strongly recommends using an [Azure Private DNS Zone](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/private-dns-privatednszone) with the private endpoint to establish a connection with a cluster. You can't validate TLS certificates using `verify-full` when connecting to an IP address. 

With a Private DNS Zone, you configure a DNS entry for your cluster's public hostname, and Azure DNS ensures that all requests to that domain name from your VNet resolve to the private endpoint's IP address instead of the cluster's IP address.

!!! Note
     You need to create a single Azure Private DNS Zone for each VNet, even if you are connecting to multiple clusters. If you've already created a DNS Zone for this VNet, you can skip to step 6.

1.  In the Azure portal search for *Private DNS Zones*.

2.  Select **Private DNS zone**.

3.  Select **Create private DNS zone**.

4.  Create a private DNS zone using your organization's domain name as an apex domain. The organization's domain name must be unique to your BigAnimal organization. For example, use `biganimal.io`.

    ![](../images/image6.png)

5.  Select the **Virtual network** link on the **Private DNS Zone** page of `brcxzr08qr7rbei1.biganimal.io` and link the private DNS Zone to the client VM's virtual network
    `vnet-client`.

     ![](../images/image10.png)

6.  Add a record for the private endpoint. The address is a private IP addressâ€”the one created with the private endpoint in the previous step.

    ![](../images/image4.png)

7.  You can now access your cluster with this private domain name.

    ```shell
    dig +short p-c4iabjleig40jngmac40.brcxzr08qr7rbei1.biganimal.io 
    psql -h p-c4iabjleig40jngmac40.brcxzr08qr7rbei1.biganimal.io -U edb_admin      
    __OUTPUT__
    10.240.1.123 
    Password for user edb_admin: 

    psql (13.4 (Ubuntu 13.4-1.pgdg28.84+1), server 13.4.8 (Debian 13.4.8-1+deb10)) 
    WARNING : psql major version 13, server major version 13. Some psql features might not work. 
    SSL connection (protocol : TLSV1.3cipherTLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits : 256, compression : off) Type "help" for help. 

    edb_admin=>

    ```

    !!! Tip
        You might need to flush your local DNS cache to resolve your domain name to the new private IP address after adding the private endpoint. For example, on Ubuntu, run the following command:

        ```shell
        sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches
        ```
