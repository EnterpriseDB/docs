title: Connecting from a client app
---

You can connect to your cluster using the client of your choice including:
- [`psql`](http://postgresguide.com/utilities/psql.html) &mdash; Terminal-based client for Postgres
- Other common database drivers.
- pgAdmin &mdash; Desktop or web UI client to inspect, monitor, manage, and query your cluster's databases. 


## Recommended settings for SSL mode

Different clients can have different default TLS/SSL modes (sslmode). For example, `psql` defaults to `prefer`, which means the client attempts to establish a TLS connection but falls back to non-TLS if the server doesn't support it. In the `psql` example provided by EDB in the **Quick Connect** field, `sslmode` is explicitly set to `require`, which means the client attempts a TLS connection and fails if the connection to the server can't be encrypted. 

For public connections and in most environments, EDB recommends setting `sslmode` to `verify-full`. This setting ensures that you connect to the server you specified and that the connection is encrypted.

BigAnimal generates certificates with LetsEncrypt, a widely trusted certificate authority. Your client machine might already have a bundled CA certificate for LetsEncrypt, for example, at `/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt` or `/etc/pki/ca-trust/extracted/pem/tls-ca-bundle.pem`. If it doesn't, your client machine needs a [CA certificate for Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/certificates/). Once the CA certificate is in place on your client machine, configure the `sslrootcert` parameter to its location, and set the `sslmode` parameter to `verify-full` to verify the certificate to fully validate the connection.

To view the encryption protocol being used for communication, [connect to the cluster using `psql`](#connect-to-your-cluster-using-psql-or-edb-psql) and use  the `conninfo` meta-command. In the case of BigAnimal,  TLS (v1.2+) is supported:

```
edb_admin=> \conninfo
You are connected to database "edb_admin" as user "edb_admin" on host "xxxxxxxxx.xxxxx.biganimal.io" at port "5432".
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
```

## Connect to your cluster using `psql` or `edb-psql`

!!!note
   When connecting to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server database, use `edb-psql`. `edb-psql` is a symbolic link to a binary called `psql`, a modified version of the PostgreSQL community `psql` with added support for EDB Postgres Advanced Server features.    

1.  Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal.

2.  Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page.

3.  Select the name of your cluster.

4.  On the **Overview** tab, select the copy icon to the right of the **Quick Connect** field to copy the command for connecting to your cluster using `psql` to your clipboard. `psql` prompts for the edb_admin user password you selected when you created the cluster.

5.  Paste the command in your terminal.

## Connect to your cluster using common database drivers

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal.

2. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page.

3. Select the name of your cluster.

4. Select the **Connect** tab. You can review and copy all the relevant information you need from this screen except for the edb_admin user password.  

   Connection string examples for common database drivers using the recommended setting for SSL mode (consult the client driver documentation for more information): 

   - #### libpq (psql or edb-psql)

     ```
     psql -W "postgres://edb_admin@xxxxxxxxx.xxxxx.biganimal.io:5432/edb_admin?sslmode=verify-full&sslrootcert=/usr/share/ca-certificates/ca-cert_name.pem"
      ```

   - #### JDBC for Java

     ```
     jdbc:postgresql://xxxxxxxxx.xxxxx.biganimal.io:5432/edb_admin?&sslrootcert=/usr/share/ca-certificates/ca-cert_name.pem&sslmode=verify-full?user=edb_admin&password=$PWD
     ```

   - #### Npgsql for DotNet Core
   
     ```
     Host=xxxxxxxxx.xxxxx.biganimal.io;Port=5432;Username=edb_admin;Password=$PWD;Database=edb_admin;SslRootCert=/usr/share/ca-certificates/ca-cert_name.pem;SslMode=verify-full
     ```

   - #### ODBC for Windows

     ```
     Driver={PostgreSQL};Server=xxxxxxxxx.xxxxx.biganimal.io;Port=5432;Database=myDataBase;Uid=edb_admin;Pwd=$PWD;sslrootcert=C:\\ssl\\ca-certificate.pem;sslmode=verify-full;
     ```



## Connect to your cluster using pgAdmin

To connect to your BigAnimal cluster from [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/), you need to enter your cluster values into pgAdmin. Keep BigAnimal and pgAdmin open to copy and paste the values. 

Navigate to the location of the values:

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal.

1. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page.

1. Select the cluster you want to connect to.

1. Select the **Connect** tab. 

Enter the values in pgAdmin:

1. Open pgAdmin.

1. In the **Quick Links** panel, select **Add New Server**. 

1. In the Create-Server dialog box, in the **General** tab, enter a server name in the **Name** field. 

1. Select the **Connection** tab.

1. Copy the corresponding values from BigAnimal and paste them into pgAdmin. 

   | BigAnimal field | pgAdmin field     | Example value |
   |-----------------|-------------------|---------------|
   | Host            | Host name/address | p-n85scw2ies.fcrziuxgkqazmhkl.s.edbcloud.io |
   | Port            | Port              | 5432          |
   | Dbname          | Maintenance database | edb_admin  |

1. In the **Username** and **Password** fields, enter the cluster's administrator credentials. These are the same credentials you set when configuring the cluster. If you didn't set the username, then copy and paste the default administrator username from the **User** field in BigAnimal. 

1. In the **SSL** tab, set the **SSL mode** field to **Require**. 

1. Select **Save**. pgAdmin attempts to connect to the BigAnimal cluster. 

## Connect a read-only workload

Clusters that are read-only enabled display separate connection strings for **Read-only** and **Read/write** access. 

To connect to your cluster with the read-only workload:

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal.

1. Go to [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters).

1. Select the cluster you want to connect to.

1. Select the **Connect** tab.

1. Copy the **Read-only Service URI**.

1. Use the **Read-only Service URI** to connect to the cluster according to your database driver.

We recommend that your applications run `SET default_transaction_read_only = true` for all read-only activity. For a libpq driver, add `options='-c default_transaction_read_only=true'` to the database connection string. Other drivers use similiar connection parameters. Also, applications can run `BEGIN TRANSACTION READ ONLY` to mark individual transactions as read-only.

!!!Note
   On read-only workloads, BigAnimal might cancel long-running queries and display an error message like the following:

   ```text
   ERROR: canceling statement due to conflict with recovery
   ```
