title: Connecting from AWS 

---

Two different methods enable you to connect to your private cluster from your application's VPC in AWS. Each method offers different levels of accessibility and security. The VPC endpoint method is recommended and is most commonly used. However, you can also use the VPC peering connection method if required by your organization.

## AWS VPC endpoint (recommended)

AWS VPC endpoint (AWS orPrivateLink) service is a network interface that securely connects a private IP address from your AWS VPC to an external service. You grant access only to a single cluster instead of the entire BigAnimal resource VPC, thus ensuring maximum network isolation. For more information, see [VPC endpoint services (AWS PrivateLink)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/endpoint-service.html).

### Pros

-   You need to configure the PrivateLink only once. Then you can use multiple VPC endpoints to connect applications from different VPCs.
-   There's no risk of IP address conflicts.

### Cons

-   There's an associated cost of resources.

See the [PrivateLink service example](01_vpc_endpoint) for the steps for connecting using this method.

## VPC peering

VPC peering allows traffic to be freely routed between two VPCs. Once peered, the two VPCs act as one with respect to connectivity. However, Network Security Group rules are still observed.

### Pros

-   Simple and easy to set up.

### Cons

-   The IP ranges of two peered VPCs can't overlap. BigAnimal VPCs use the 10.240.0.0/16 address space and can't be peered with VPCs using this same space.

See the [VPC peering example](02_vpc_peering) for the steps to connect using this VPC peering.
