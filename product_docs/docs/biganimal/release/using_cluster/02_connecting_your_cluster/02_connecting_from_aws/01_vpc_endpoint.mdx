title: VPC endpoint example

---

This example shows how to connect your cluster using VPC endpoints.

Assume that your cluster is on an account called `development` and is being accessed from a client on another account called `test` with the following properties:

-   BigAnimal cluster:
    -   AWS account: `development`
    -   Amazon resource name (ARN): `arn:aws:iam::123456789123:root`
    -   Cluster ID: `p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg` 
    -   Account ID: `brcxzr08qr7rbei1` 
    -   Organization's domain name: `biganimal.io`

-   Client:
    -   AWS account: `test`
    -   Resource group: `rg-client`
    -   VPC: `vpc-client`
    -   VPC subnet: `snet-client`

## Prerequisites

To walk through an example in your own environment, you need:

- Your cluster URL. You can find the URL in the **Connect** tab of your cluster instance in the BigAnimal portal.


## Step 1: Create an endpoint service for your cluster

In the AWS account connected to BigAnimal, create an endpoint service to provide access to your clusters from other VPCs in other AWS accounts. Perform this procedure for each cluster to which you want to provide access.

1. Open the [Amazon EC2 console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/). Ensure that the correct region, where your cluster is deployed, is selected in the upper-right corner of the console.

1. In the navigation pane, under **Load Balancing**, select **Load Balancers**.

1. You can see a list of load balancers, and each load balancer is tagged with the ID of the cluster to which it is deployed (`service.k8s.aws/stack: default/<cluster_ID>`). For example, `service.k8s.aws/stack: default/p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg`.

1. Identify the load balancer that is tagged with the ID of the cluster to which you want to connect. Note the name of that network load balancer.

1. Open the [Amazon VPC console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/). 

1. From the navigation pane on the left, select **Endpoint Services** under **Virtual Private Cloud**, and then select **Create endpoint service**.

1. Enter a suitable name for the endpoint service.

1. Select **Network** for the load balancer type.

1. Under **Available load balancers**, select the network load balancer of the cluster to which you want to connect. 
 
1. Leave all the other fields with their default values and select **Create**. 

1. Under Details, note the **Service name** of the created endpoint service (for example, `com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0e123abc123198abc`). You will need the service name while creating a VPC endpoint.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Endpoint Services**.

1. Select your endpoint service from the **Actions** list, and select **Allow principals**.
 
1. Add the AWS account with which you want to connect to the endpoint service by specifying the ARN for the principal. The ARN must be in this format:

 arn:aws:iam::&lt;AWS ACCOUNT ID&gt;:root


## Step 2: Create a VPC endpoint in the client's VPC

Now that your endpoint service is created, you can connect it to the cluster VPC using a VPC endpoint. Perform this procedure in your application's AWS account. 

!!! Note
    In your application's AWS account, ensure that you allow your application's security group to connect to your cluster.


1. Open the [Amazon VPC console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/).

1. Ensure that the correct region, where your cluster is deployed, is selected in the upper-right corner of the console.

1. From the navigation pane on the left, select **Endpoints** under **Virtual Private Cloud**, and then select **Create endpoint**.

1. Enter a suitable name for the endpoint service.

1. Under **Service category**, select **Other endpoint services**.

1. Under **Service Name**, enter the name of the endpoint service that you created earlier (`com.amazonaws.vpce.us-east-1.vpce-svc-0e123abc123198abc`). Verify whether you have successfully allowed access to the endpoint by selecting **Verify service**.

1. Under VPC, select the client's VPC in which to create the endpoint. 

1. Under **Subnets**, select the subnets (availability zones) in which to create the endpoint network interfaces. Enable the endpoint in all availability zones used by your application.

1. Select **Create endpoint**.

## Step 3: Accept and test the connection

1. In your AWS account connected to BigAnimal, select **VPCs** and then select **Endpoint services**. 

1. Select the endpoint service instance you created previously and accept the endpoint connection request under **Endpoint connections**. 

1. You can now successfully connect to your cluster.

 In your application's AWS account, select **VPC** and then select **Endpoints**. Select the endpoint you created previously and use the DNS name provided in the details section to access your cluster.
