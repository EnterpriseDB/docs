title: VPC peering example

---

This example shows how to connect using VPC peering. 

!!! Note
    BigAnimal uses the 10.0.0.0/16 address space and can't be peered with VPCs using this same space. If they do, the status of the VPC peering connection immediately goes to failed. 

Assume that your cluster is on an account called `development` and is being accessed from a Linux client VM on another account called `test` with the following properties:

-   Cluster:
    -   AWS account name: `development`
    -   Cluster ID: `p-c4j0jfcmp3af2ieok5eg` 
    -   Account ID: `brcxzr08qr7rbei1` 
    -   Organization's domain name: `biganimal.io` 
    -   VPC: `vpc-cluster`


-   Linux client VM called `vm-client`:
    -   Subscription: `test`
    -   VPC: `vpc-client`
    -   VPC subnet: `snet-client`
    


## Prerequisites

To walk through an example in your own environment, you need:

-   Your cluster URL. You can find the URL in the **Connect** tab of your cluster instance in the BigAnimal portal.
-   A Postgresql client, such as [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), installed on your client VM.

You need to add two peering links, one from the client VPC `vpc-client` and the other from your cluster's VPC `vnet-japaneast`. 

## VPC peering connection with a VPC in another AWS account

You can create a VPC peering connection with a VPC in the same region or a different region.

### Request a VPC peering connection with a VPC in another account

1. Log in to the AWS account associated with your BigAnimal account.

1. Open the [Amazon VPC console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/).

1. In the navigation pane, select **Peering Connections**, and then select **Create Peering Connection**.

1. Enter a suitable name for the peering connection.

1. For **VPC (Requester)**, select the cluster's VPC in your account.

1. Select **Another account**.

1. Enter the AWS account ID of the owner of the accepter VPC.

1.(Optional) Select **Another region**, and then select the region in which the accepter VPC resides.
 
1. For **VPC (Accepter)**, enter the ID of the client VPC.

1. Select **Create Peering Connection**.

1. In the confirmation, select **OK**.

1. The VPC peering connection that you created isn't active. To activate it, the owner of the accepter VPC must accept the VPC peering connection request. To enable traffic to be directed to the peer VPC, update your VPC route table. For more information, see [Update your route tables for a VPC peering connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/vpc-peering-routing.html).

## VPC peering connection with another VPC in your account 

You can create a VPC peering connection with a VPC in the same region or a different region.

### Create a VPC peering connection with a VPC in the same region

1. Open the [Amazon VPC console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/).

1. In the navigation pane, select **Peering Connections**, and then select **Create Peering Connection**.

1. For **VPC (Requester)**, select the cluster VPC in your account.

1. Ensure **My account** is selected. 
 
1. Select **Another VPC to peer with**. Then select **Add tag** and enter the key-value pair of the VPC you want to connect with.

1. Select **Create Peering Connection**.

1. In the confirmation, select **OK**.

1. Select the VPC peering connection that you created, select **Actions**, and then select **Accept Request**.

 In the confirmation, select **Yes, Accept**. A second confirmation appears; select **Modify my route tables now** to go directly to the route tables page, or select **Close** to do this later.

1. Now that your VPC peering connection is active, you must add an entry to your VPC route tables to enable traffic to be directed between the peered VPCs. For more information, see [Update your route tables for a VPC peering connection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/vpc-peering-routing.html).
 <!-- Is there any specific recommendation for the user here? -->

1. Access the cluster with its domain name from your cluster's connection string. It's accessible from `vpc-client` after peering.

```    
$ psql -h vpce-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX.eu-west-1.vpce.amazonaws.com -U edb_admin

### Create a VPC peering connection with a VPC in a different region

1. Open the [Amazon VPC console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/vpc/).

1. In the navigation pane, select **Peering Connections > Create Peering Connection**.

1. You can optionally name your VPC peering connection. Doing so creates a tag with a key of the name and a value that you specify.

1. Select the requester VPC in your account with which to request the VPC peering connection.

1. Ensure **My account** is selected.

1. Select **Another region**, and then select the region in which the accepter VPC resides.

1. Enter the ID of the client VPC.

1. Select **Create Peering Connection**.

1. In the confirmation, select **OK**.

1. Select the region of the accepter VPC in the upper right corner of the AWS console.

1. In the navigation pane, select **Peering Connections**. Select the VPC peering connection that you created, select **Actions**, and then select **Accept Request**.

1. In the confirmation, select **Yes, Accept**. A second confirmation appears; select **Modify my route tables now** to go directly to the route tables page, or select **Close** to do this later.
 
1. Now that your VPC peering connection is active, you must add an entry to your VPC route tables to enable traffic to be directed between the peered VPCs.
