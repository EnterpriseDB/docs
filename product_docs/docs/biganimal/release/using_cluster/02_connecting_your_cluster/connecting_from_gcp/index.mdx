title: Connecting from Google Cloud
---

You can use Google Cloud's [Private Service Connect](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-private-service-connect-producer) to publish services using internal IP addresses in your VPC network. Private Service Connect is a network interface that securely connects a private IP address from your Google CLoud VPC to an external service. You grant access only to a single cluster instead of the entire BigAnimal resource VPC, thus ensuring maximum network isolation. 

Private Service Connect provides two methods to connect to published services: using endpoints or load balancers. We provide step-by-step directions in the knowledge base for the method using load balancers (also referred to as Private Service Connect backends). Private Service Connect backends use a load balancer configured with Private Service Connect network endpoint group (NEG) backends. For more information, see [About Private Service Connect backends](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/private-service-connect-backends) and [Create a Private Service Connect backend](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/access-apis-managed-services-private-service-connect-backends).
