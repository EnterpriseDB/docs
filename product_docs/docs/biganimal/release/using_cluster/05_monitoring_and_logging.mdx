title: "Monitoring and logging"
---

You can monitor your Postgres clusters by viewing the metrics and logs from
Azure.

For existing Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) users who wish to monitor
BigAnimal clusters alongside self-managed Postgres clusters, you can use the
remote Remote Monitoring capability of PEM. For more information on using PEM
to monitor your clusters see
[Remote Monitoring](../../../../../pem/latest/pem_admin/02a_pem_remote_monitoring).

The following sections describes how to access logs and metrics directly in the
Azure portal.

As every customer's needs are different, it is anticipated that applying Azure
Monitor features to the supplied data streams will enable customers to create
tailored insights into their workloads in order to better meet their business
goals.

Pre-defined dashboards and metrics queries are provided in Azure Monitor as a
starting point for exploring the available data.

## Viewing metrics and logs from Azure

BigAnimal sends all metrics and logs from Postgres clusters to Azure. The
following describes what metrics and logs are sent and how to view them.

### Azure Log Analytics

When BigAnimal deploys workloads on Azure, the logs from the postgres
clusters are forwarded to the Azure Log Workspace.

A pre-defined shared dashboard panel in the Azure Portal shows recent postgres
logs. To query BigAnimal logs in more detail you must use
[Azure Log Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/logs/log-analytics-overview)
and the
[Kusto Query language](https://azure-training.com/azure-data-science/the-kusto-query-language/).

###  Using shared dashboards to view PostgreSQL cluster logs and metrics

To view logs and selected metrics summaries from your PostgreSQL clusters using
Shared Dashboard:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Select **Resource Groups**.
2. Select the Resource Group corresponding to the region where you choose to
   deploy your BigAnimal cluster. You will see resources included in that
   Resource Group.
3. Select the resource of type _Shared Dashboard_ with the suffix -customer.
4. Select the **Go to dashboard** link located at the top of the page.

The default shared dashboard provided by BigAnimal will be extended and
enhanced over time. It includes panels for monitoring and diagnostic
information like:

* Recent log entries for all clusters
* Row insert, update, and delete rates per database
* Query deadlock rates
* Connection counts over time
* Temporary storage use trend
* Replication lag
* Age of longest running transaction

!!! Important
Changes you make to the shared dashboard will be overwritten when
BigAnimal updates are deployed. Create your own custom dashboard if you wish to
modify or extend the provided dashboard. You can start with the BigAnimal dashboard
by using the "Clone" button in the dashboard view.
!!!

### Querying PostgreSQL cluster logs and metrics

All logs from your PostgreSQL clusters are stored in the _Customer Log
Analytics workspace_. To find your _Customer Log Analytics workspace_:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Select **Resource Groups**.
2. Select the Resource Group corresponding to the region where you choose to
   deploy your BigAnimal cluster. You will see resources included in that Resource
   Group.
3. Select the resource of type _Log Analytics workspace_ with the suffix -customer.
4. Select the Logs in the menu on the left in the General section.
5. Close the dashboard with pre-built queries. This will bring you to the KQL Editor.

#### Available Logs and Metrics

See the next section [Metrics Details](#metrics-details-list) for a listing of
available metrics and details on the structure of log entries.

#### Example Log Queries

For example,

```
PostgresLogs_CL
| project record_log_time_s, record_error_severity_s, record_detail_s
| sort by record_log_time_s desc

PostgresAuditLogs_CL
| where logger_s == "pgaudit"
| project record_log_time_s, record_error_severity_s, record_audit_statement_s
| sort by record_log_time_s desc

PostgresAuditLogs_CL
| where logger_s == "edb_audit"
| project record_log_time_s, record_error_severity_s, record_message_s
| sort by record_log_time_s desc
```


#### Example Metrics Queries

To list the metrics from BigAnimal presently available in the `InsightsMetrics`
table use this query:

```
InsightsMetrics
| where Namespace == "prometheus"
| distinct Name
```

(Or just use Metrics Explorer).
