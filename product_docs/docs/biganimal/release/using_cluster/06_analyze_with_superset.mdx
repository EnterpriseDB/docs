title: "Analyzing your data with Apache Superset"
---
You can use Apache Superset to analyze, explore, and visualize data stored in your Postgres clusters when using your own cloud account. (Apache Superset isn't supported on BigAnimal's cloud account.) You can open Superset from the [BigAnimal portal](https://portal.biganimal.com/) using the **Analyze** links. 

!!!note
   Contact [BigAnimal Support](../overview/support) to enable the Apache Superset feature. 
!!!

Default permissions include the ability to view data and create dashboards. To add or modify data sources, you need additional permissions. For more information on permissions to access Superset, see [Managing Superset access](../administering_cluster/01a_superset_access).


## Connecting Superset to your cluster

To connect to Superset, in addition to your password, you need your user, host, port, and database name. To find this information for your cluster:

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal portal](https://portal.biganimal.com/).

3. Go to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page.
4. Select the name of your cluster.
5. Select the **Connect** tab.

!!! note
    To connect with Superset in a private network database cluster, both the cluster and Superset must be on the same network. 

To connect to a BigAnimal cluster:

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal portal](https://portal.biganimal.com/).

2. Select **Analyze > Connections**.
3. Select **+ Database**.
4. In the Add Database dialog box, enter a value for **Database Name**.
5. To connect to the database, you need a database user with a password. Enter the connection string for your cluster in the **SQLALCHEMY URI** field, using the following format:

    `postgresql://{<username>}:{<password>}@{<host>}:{<port>}/{<dbname>}?sslmode=verify-full`
   !!!note
   Your password is always encrypted before storage and never leaves your cloud environment. It's used only by the Superset software running in your BigAnimal infrastructure. As a defense-in-depth mechanism, we recommend using a Postgres user dedicated to Superset with a minimal set of privileges to just the database you're connecting. Never use your edb_admin superuser or equivalent user with Superset.
   !!!
   
6. Check the connection by selecting **Test Connection**. Select **Add** if the connection was successful.

For more information on connecting to Superset, see the Superset documentation:
- [Connecting Superset to a new database](https://superset.apache.org/docs/creating-charts-dashboards/creating-your-first-dashboard/#connecting-to-a-new-database). Connecting Superset to a BigAnimal cluster is similar to connecting to any new database.
- [Superset documentation on connecting to Postgres](https://superset.apache.org/docs/databases/postgres/).


Upon successful connection, you can add datasets, charts, and dashboards.


## Using Superset dashboards

You can use Superset dashboards to analyze data stored in your cluster. For a tutorial on creating a simple dashboard, see [Creating Your First Dashboard](https://superset.apache.org/docs/creating-charts-dashboards/creating-your-first-dashboard).

To view all available Superset dashboards, select **Analyze > Dashboards**.

To create a dashboard for monitoring EDB Postgres Distributed, you can use the template we provide. See [Configuring an EDB Postgres Distributed dashboard](#configuring-an-edb-postgres-distributed-dashboard) for more information.

### Configuring an EDB Postgres Distributed dashboard
We provide a template for an EDB Postgres Distributed dashboard in JSON format (`utils/superset/pgd_monitoring_template.json`) in the [cloud-utilities](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-utilities) repository. The JSON file includes the schema of the dashboard and the individual charts.

To add the dashboard:

1. Clone the [cloud-utilities](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-utilities) repository on your local system.

2. Using Python 3.4 or later, create an output JSON file:

   1. Change your working directory:

      ```py
      cd cloud-utilities/utils/superset
      ```

   1. Change the permissions on the script to make it executable:
      
      ```
      chmod +x db_name_change.py
      ```

   1. Run the script:

      ```
      ./db_name_change.py <database_name> -i <input_file> -o <output_file>
      ```
   
      For example:

      ```py
      ./db_name_change.py edb -i utils/superset/pgd_monitoring_template.json  -o utils/superset/upload.json
      ```

   To get more information on the `db_name_change` script, run:

   ```py
   ./db_name_change.py -h
   ```

3. In Superset, import your output file by selecting **Analyze > Dashboards > Import dashboard**.

## Using Superset charts

You can use Superset charts to visualize data stored in your cluster. See the [Superset documentation](https://superset.apache.org/docs/creating-charts-dashboards/exploring-data) for instructions and examples of creating Superset charts.

To view all available Superset charts, select **Analyze > Charts**.


## Using  Superset SQL Lab

You can use Superset SQL Lab to write queries to access and modify data stored in your cluster. To access SQL Lab, select **Analyze > SQL Editor**.
