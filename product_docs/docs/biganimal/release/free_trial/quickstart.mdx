Follow this quick walk-through to configure a PostgreSQL 15 cluster on BigAnimal running against AWS with a free trial account. 

## Step 1: Create an account and sign into the portal

If you haven't done so already, you'll need to [create your EDB account](detail/create_an_account). 

Then, use your newly created account to access the [BigAnimal free trial portal](https://freetrial.biganimal.com/).

!!! Note
    Continue to use the portal at [freetrial.biganimal.com](https://freetrial.biganimal.com/) to access BigAnimal  for the duration of your free trial.

## Step 2: Create an AWS cluster 

1. Select the **Clusters** link on the left to navigate to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page.

1. Select **Create New Cluster**.

    You should now find yourself at the [Create Cluster page](https://portal.biganimal.com/create-cluster).

1. Select **Single Node** as your cluster type.
1. For **Provider**, select **AWS**.
1. Select **Next: Cluster Settings**.
1. In the **Cluster Name** field, enter `AWS PostgreSQL cluster`.
1. In the **Password** field, enter a strong, memorable password. 

   This is the admin password for the cluster.
1. For **Database Type**, select **PostgreSQL**. 

   This selection gives you an official build of PostgreSQL.
1. For **Postgres Version**, select **15**.

1. For **Region**, select **US East 1**.
1. For **Instance Type** and **Storage**, only one set of options is available in the trial. Select each option.
1. Select **Create Cluster**. You'll be brought back to the Clusters page with your newly configured cluster now populating the list. It usually takes a minute or two for your cluster to be ready but can take up to an hour. A progress bar is shown near the right.

### Managing your cluster

After you select **Create Cluster**, you'll be brought back to the Clusters page with your newly configured cluster now populating the list. In the free trial, you can provision only one cluster at a time. That said, you can delete your cluster, start a new cluster, and even restore a deleted cluster. BigAnimal automatically backs up clusters.

Once your first cluster is fully provisioned, your 14-day free trial officially starts, and a countdown appears telling you how many days are left in your trial.

## Step 3: Connect to your new cluster

1. Select your cluster to get an overview of how it has been configured. Select the **Connect** tab to see more information about how to connect to your cluster.
2. Select the **Overview** tab and copy the **Quick Connect** command. Paste it into a terminal where psql is installed. It will prompt for your password and put you on a SQL command line.

   ```text
   $ psql -W "postgres://edb_admin@p-qzwv2ns7pj.pg.biganimal.io:5432/edb_admin?sslmode=require"
   Password: 
   psql (15.2)
   SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, compression: off)
   Type "help" for help.

   edb_admin=> 
   ```

!!! Note
    While psql is a good all-around option for working with Postgres databases, you can use the client of your choice. See [Connect to a cluster](detail/connect_to_a_cluster) for more ideas.


## Things to try

### Create a new database

We're going to create some sample math data, so we're going to create a database called `math`. We could use the default `edb_admin` database, but best practice is to isolate data.

1. Create a new `math` database.

   ```sql
   create database math;
   ```

   !!! Note
       Normally, we would also create a separate, limited-privilege user to own this database. However, the free trial user can't create users, so we can only create the database. 

2. Connect to the `math` database. You're prompted for the `edb_admin` password you provided in Step 2 above.

   ```sql
   \connect math
   ```


### Populate a table and query it

We're going to use temporary tables to calculate prime numbers using a [Sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).

1. Create a table called `primes` for storing prime numbers.

   ```sql
   CREATE TABLE primes (
     num INTEGER,
     PRIMARY KEY (num)
   );
   ```

2. Populate the table with all prime numbers up to 1000. (This code is based on [code from David Fetter](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes).)

   ```sql
   -- Based on https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes
   
   WITH RECURSIVE
   t0(m) AS (
       VALUES(1000)
   ),
   t1(n) AS (
       VALUES(2)
   UNION ALL
       SELECT n+1 FROM t1 WHERE n < (SELECT m FROM t0)
   ),
   t2 (n, i) AS (
       SELECT 2*n, 2
       FROM t1 WHERE 2*n <= (SELECT m FROM t0)
   UNION ALL
       (
           WITH t3(k) AS (
               SELECT max(i) OVER () + 1 FROM t2
           ),
           t4(k) AS (
               SELECT DISTINCT k FROM t3
           )
           SELECT k*n, k
           FROM
               t1
           CROSS JOIN
               t4
           WHERE k*k <= (SELECT m FROM t0)
       )
   )
   INSERT INTO primes (
     SELECT n FROM t1 EXCEPT
     SELECT n FROM t2
     ORDER BY 1
   );
   ```

3. Select the largest prime number less than 1000.

   ```sql
   SELECT max(num)
   FROM primes
   WHERE num < 1000;
   ```
