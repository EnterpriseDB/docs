The BigAnimal free trial allows one active cluster. If you want to try another configuration, you'll need to delete your active cluster. Fortunately, it's also quick and easy to [restore your deleted cluster from a backup](../experiment/backup_and_restore/) if you need to later on. Backups are automatically created as soon as a cluster is used.

When you create a cluster, you can choose from two flavors of PostgreSQL:

- All supported versions of [open-source PostgreSQL](/supported-open-source/postgresql/)
- [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/), which augments open-source PostgreSQL with [Oracle compatibility](/epas/latest/epas_compat_ora_dev_guide/), among other features

We'll show two methods of creating a cluster:

- [Using the portal](create_cluster_portal)
- [Using the command line](create_cluster_cli)

You can also create clusters programmatically using the [fully featured BigAnimal API](/biganimal/latest/reference/api/).
