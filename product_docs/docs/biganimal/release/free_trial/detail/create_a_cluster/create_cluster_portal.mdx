## Navigating to the Create Cluster page

1. Navigate to the [BigAnimal portal](https://portal.biganimal.com). Sign in with [your account](../create_an_account).

2. Select the **Clusters** link on the left to navigate to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page.

3. Select **Create New Cluster**, which opens the [Create Cluster page](https://portal.biganimal.com/create-cluster). 

4. Select the options you want for your cluster. See [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/) in the full version documentation for details on the options.


## Provisioning 

Select **Create Cluster**, and you're brought back to the Clusters page with your newly configured cluster now populating the list.

Initially, the new cluster is being provisioned. This usually takes a minute or two but can take up to an hour. A progress bar is shown near the right.

Select the provisioned cluster to view the parameters you'll need to connect to it.
