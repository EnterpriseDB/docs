!!! Note
    All of the parameters you need to connect can be found on the portal by selecting the name of your cluster on the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page and then selecting the **Connect** tab.


[The pgAdmin project](https://www.pgadmin.org/download/) allows you to inspect, monitor, manage, and query your cluster's databases from a desktop or web UI. 

From the welcome page, select **Add New Server**. You'll be prompted to configure the connection.

Enter `BigAnimal Trial` for the name (or use the name you gave to your cluster!), and then select **Connection**.

1. Enter your cluster's hostname in the **Host name/address** field. 
2. Enter `edb_admin` in the **Maintenance database** field (this is the default database that'll be connected to by pgAdmin). 
3. Enter `edb_admin` in the **Username** field.
4. Enter the password you provided when configuring your cluster in the **Password** field (you might want to save this for convenience while testing).

Select **SSL** and change SSL mode to **Require**.

Finally, select the **Save** button. pgAdmin tries to establish a connection to your database. When successful, it displays the dashboard 
along with the list of available databases on the left.
