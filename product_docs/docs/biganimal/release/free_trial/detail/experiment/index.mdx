Once you've [created a cluster](../create_a_cluster/), it's time to put it through its paces. 
Here are some examples to get you started:

* [Backup and restore](backup_and_restore)
* [Import data](import_data)

## Experimenting with different configurations during the trial

You can have only one _active_ cluster at a time. But what if you want to do some extensive testing on multiple clusters? Perhaps to compare different cloud providers, regions, or database options against an [import](import_data) of a representative dataset? 

If you want to configure a new cluster, you can delete the currently active one: 

1. Navigate to the [Clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) page on the portal.

2. Select the delete button (trash can icon) on the active cluster.
3. Confirm the deletion.
4. Reload the page.

Now the **Create New Cluster** button is enabled again, and you can [create a new cluster](../create_a_cluster) or [restore a previously deleted one](backup_and_restore).
