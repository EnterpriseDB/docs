PostgreSQL includes a variety of ways to import data. Here, we'll show how to import a CSV file from the internet.

!!! Caution 
    Be careful when loading your own data in the Trial version and avoid storing sensitive information; trial clusters
    are hosted in a shared environment.

    For a more comprehensive evaluation that runs under your own cloud account, [contact our Sales team](https://www.enterprisedb.com/contact).

For this demonstration, we're just going to import batter data from the [Baseball Databank](https://github.com/chadwickbureau/baseballdatabank), which is in CSV form. While it's easy to import the data using [PostgreSQL's COPY command](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-copy.html), we'll need to first define a table to put that data into. 

We're going to [add a database](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/01_postgres_access/#one-database-with-one-application) called "baseball," which we'll populate with some Major League Baseball statistics.

```sql
create user baseball with password 'baseball_pwd';
grant baseball to edb_admin;
create database baseball with owner baseball;
```

Now you can switch to your new (and empty) baseball database.

```sql
\c baseball
```

You can just copy and paste this command into your terminal.

```sql
CREATE TABLE batters (
                      id SERIAL,
                      playerid VARCHAR(9),
                      yearid INTEGER,
                      stint INTEGER,
                      teamid VARCHAR(3),
                      lgid VARCHAR(2),
                      g INTEGER,
                      ab INTEGER,
                      r INTEGER,
                      h INTEGER,
                      "2b" INTEGER,
                      "3b" INTEGER,
                      hr INTEGER,
                      rbi INTEGER,
                      sb INTEGER,
                      cs INTEGER,
                      bb INTEGER,
                      so INTEGER,
                      ibb INTEGER,
                      hbp INTEGER,
                      sh INTEGER,
                      sf INTEGER,
                      gidp INTEGER,
                      PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

Now we can populate the table from the internet using the most recent data.

```sql
\COPY batters(playerid,yearid,stint,teamid,lgid,g,ab,r,h,"2b","3b",hr,rbi,sb,cs,bb,so,ibb,hbp,sh,sf,gidp) FROM PROGRAM 'curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chadwickbureau/baseballdatabank/master/core/Batting.csv"' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER
```

Just to prove there's data loaded, let's look at the home run leaders for the 1998 season.

```sql
SELECT playerid, yearid, teamid,
       rank() OVER (PARTITION BY yearid ORDER BY hr desc) hr_rank,
       hr
FROM batters
WHERE yearid = 1998
ORDER BY hr_rank LIMIT 5;
```
