AWS Config rules represent desired configuration settings for AWS resources and help you monitor, identify, and remediate noncompliant ones. AWS Security Hub leverages AWS Config by introducing dedicated sets of AWS Config security rules associated with several security standards. It aggregates findings from rule violations and other AWS or third party services.

For more information, see:
- [What Is AWS Config?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/config/latest/developerguide/WhatIsConfig.html)
- [What is AWS Security Hub?](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/what-is-securityhub.html)

BigAnimal doesn’t customize your AWS Config rules to prevent conflicts with external workloads.
