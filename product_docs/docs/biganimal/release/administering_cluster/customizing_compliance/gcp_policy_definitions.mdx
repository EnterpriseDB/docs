GCP uses Assured Workloads and Organization Policies to ensure compliance rules are respected. Assured Workloads monitoring scans your environment in real time and provides alerts whenever organization policy changes violate the defined compliance posture. The monitoring dashboard shows which policy is being violated and provides instructions on how to resolve the finding.

For more information, see:
- [Overview of Assured Workloads](https://cloud.google.com/assured-workloads/docs/overview)
- [Introduction to the Organization Policy Service](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/organization-policy/overview)

BigAnimal doesnâ€™t customize your GCP compliance rules to prevent conflicts with external workloads.
