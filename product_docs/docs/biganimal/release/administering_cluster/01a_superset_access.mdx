You control access to Superset data sources by using Superset roles and permissions. 

Superset has three roles mapped to BigAnimal roles:

- Gamma
- Alpha
- Admin

Learn more about Superset roles, users, and permissions management in [Superset Security](https://superset.apache.org/docs/security). 

The Superset roles map to BigAnimal permissions. You can add the Superset BigAnimal permissions to BigAnimal user roles, as needed.

| Superset role   | Description | BigAnimal permissions mapped to Superset role   
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Gamma | View data that user has been granted access to, create dashboards | Reader |
| Alpha | All Superset Gamma privileges, plus the ability to add or modify data sources | Contributor |
| Admin | All Superset Alpha privileges, plus access to SQL Lab and the ability to grant or revoke access to data to other users | Owner |

To assign Superset permissions to the BigAnimal user role, see [Changing role permissions](01_portal_access/#changing-role-permissions).
