title: Managing Superset Access
---

You control access to Superset data sources by Superset roles and permissions. 

Superset has three roles:

- Gamma
- Alpha
- Admin

Learn more about Superset roles, users, and permissions management in [Superset Security](https://superset.apache.org/docs/security). 

The Superset roles map to BigAnimal permissions. You can add the Superset BigAnimal permissions to BigAnimal user roles, as needed.

| Superset Role   | Description | BigAnimal Permissions Mapped to Superset Role   
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Gamma | View data that user has been granted access to, create dashboards | No additional permissions needed 
| Alpha | All Superset Gamma privileges, plus the ability to add or alter data  sources | superset:alpha                       |
| Admin | All Superset Alpha privileges, plus the ability to grant or revoke access to data to other users  | superset:admin                    

To assign Superset permissions to the BigAnimal user role, see [Changing Role Permissions](01_portal_access/#changing-role-permissions).
