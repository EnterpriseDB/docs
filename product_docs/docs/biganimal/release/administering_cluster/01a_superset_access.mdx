You control access to Superset data sources by using Superset roles and permissions. 

Superset has three roles mapped to BigAnimal roles:

- Gamma
- Alpha
- Admin

Learn more about Superset roles, users, and permissions management in [Superset Security](https://superset.apache.org/docs/security). 

The Superset roles map to BigAnimal permissions.

!!!NoteNotes
    - Access to Superset is currently limited to the initial default project set up by BigAnimal. The user needs to have a project role for the initial project to access Superset.
    - While Admin users have access to all databases by default, both Alpha and Gamma users need to be given access by way of the Superset sql_lab role on a per-database basis. The sql_lab role grants access to SQL Lab. 

To assign BigAnimal user roles, see [Users](01_portal_access/#users).
