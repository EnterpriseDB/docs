BigAnimal uses role-based access controls to grant users access to different parts of the application using organization-level and project-level roles. Roles are sets of permissions. BigAnimal uses roles to manage permissions assigned to users.

Each customer has a unique BigAnimal organization. Each organization has at least one project by default. An organization's database clusters are deployed and managed in the customer's cloud account within a project. You can create multiple projects within a single organization.

With multiple projects within an organization you can: 
- Separate workflows to provide secure and isolated environments. 
- Assign different users to different projects or give different roles to users in different projects to ensure they have the correct level of permissions.

To access a BigAnimal organization, first each user needs to be added to the organization's identity provider. For more information, see [Setting up your identity provider](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/identity_provider/). Your identity provider establishes the identity of users that can log in to BigAnimal. 

Once a user has logged in to BigAnimal, you can assign them a role.
