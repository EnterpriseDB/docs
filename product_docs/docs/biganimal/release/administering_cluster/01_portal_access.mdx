BigAnimal authenticate users using your organization's identity manager if you are using your own cloud account or Azure Active Directory (AD) if you purchased BigAnimal through Azure Marketplace. 

BigAnimal uses role-based access controls to grant users access to different parts of the application.

## Organizations

Each subscribed customer has a unique *organization*. Each organization’s database clusters are deployed and managed in the customer's cloud account. This approach ensures complete segregation of customer data between organizations.

For Azure Marketplace accounts, each BigAnimal organization is associated with an Azure AD tenant. Azure AD establishes the identity of users that belong to an organization. After Azure AD is linked during subscription, users that belong to that AD can log in with minimum access privileges.

For your own cloud account, your identity manager establishes the identity of users that belong to an organization. After an organization's identity provider is set up, users added to the identity manager can log in with minimum access privileges.

BigAnimal supports role-based access control policies. A user with the owner role can assign roles to other users in the same organization.

## Roles

Access to BigAnimal is controlled by roles. Roles are sets of permissions. You use roles to manage permissions assigned to users.

Each organization has three default roles available:

-   account owner
-   contributor
-   reader


### Permissions

Permissions are generally represented in the format *action*:*object* where *action* represents an operation to perform and *object* represents a category of portal functionality.

-   The available actions are: create, read, update, and delete.

-   The available objects are: cloud accounts, backups, billing, clusters, events, identity providers, permissions, roles, users, and versions.

!!! Note
    Not every object supports all the actions. For example, versions objects are always read-only.

### Permissions by role

The following are the default permissions by role:

| Role          | Object            | Permissions |
| ------------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| account owner | backups           | create, read, update, and delete |
|               | cloud account     | create, read, and update         |

|               | cloud account     | read                             |
|               | billing           | read                             |
|               | clusters          | read                             |
|               | events            | read                             | 
|               | roles             | read                             |
|               | permissions       | read                             |
|               | users             | read                             |

## Users

If you purchased BigAnimal through Azure Marketplace, when you configured your Azure subscription, you also enabled BigAnimal to authenticate users from your organization using Azure AD. Before users become visible in the BigAnimal **Users** screen, they need to sign in using Azure AD after receiving special emails from your organization. 

If you are using your own account, you enabled BigAnimal to authenticate users from your organization using your identity provider. Before users become visible in the BigAnimal **Users** screen, they need to log in. 

New users signed in to BigAnimal have a minimum set of permissions until you assign them a role.
 

### Assign roles to users

1.  Navigate to **Admin > Users**.

2.  Select the edit icon for the user.

3.  Select **Assign Roles**.

4.  Select or clear roles for the user.

5.  Select **Submit**.

!!! Note
    For a user's role assignment to take effect, the user must log out from BigAnimal and log in again.

### View users

You can view all users from your organization who have logged in at least once.

1.  Navigate to **Admin > Users**.

2.  View the list of users. You can use search to narrow the list and you can also sort it by name or email.

## Example scenario for Azure Marketplace

1.  The BigAnimal organization is created, and Tom logs in and is granted the account owner role.

2.  Tom asks Jerry to log in, using his Azure AD account. Jerry's account in BigAnimal is created.

3.  Tom grants Sally the contributor role. Sally logs out and back in. She can now create BigAnimal clusters.

4.  Sally asks Jerry to log in and grants him the contributor role.

5.  Jerry logs out and back in. He can now see the clusters that Sally created and can create clusters.

## Example scenario for your own cloud account

1.  Tom is the first user and sets up the identity provider. He is granted the account owner role.

2.  Tom invites Jerry and Sally to log in through the organizations identity provider. Both of their accounts in BigAnimal are automatically created with the role of reader.

3.  Tom grants Sally the contributor role. Sally logs out and back in. She can now create BigAnimal clusters.

4.  Sally asks Jerry to log in and grants him the contributor role.

5.  Jerry logs out and back in. He can now see the clusters that Sally created and can create clusters.
