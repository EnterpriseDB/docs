BigAnimal uses Azure Active Directory (AD) to authenticate users and role-based access controls to grant users access to different parts of the application.

## Organizations

Each subscribed customer has a unique *organization*. Each organization’s database clusters are deployed and managed in the customer's cloud account. This approach ensures complete segregation of customer data between organizations.

Each BigAnimal organization is associated with an Azure AD tenant. Azure AD establishes the identity of users that belong to an organization. After Azure AD is linked during subscription, users that belong to that AD can log in with minimum access privileges.

BigAnimal supports role-based access control policies. A user with the owner role can assign roles to other users in the same organization.

## Roles

Access to BigAnimal is controlled by roles. Roles are sets of permissions. You use roles to manage permissions assigned to users.

Each organization has three default roles available:

-   owner
-   reader
-   contributor

You can edit these roles by changing their name or description.

### Permissions

Permissions are generally represented in the format *action*:*object* where *action* represents an operation to perform and *object* represents a category of portal functionality.

-   The available actions are: create, read, update, and delete.

-   The available objects are: backups, billing, clusters, events, permissions, roles, users, and versions.

!!! Note
    Not every object supports all the actions. For example, versions objects are always read-only.

### Permissions by role

The following are the default permission by role:

| Role        | Action | backups | billing | clusters | events | roles | permissions | users | versions |
| ----------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | -------- | ------ | ----- | ----------- | ----- | -------- |
| owner       | create | x       |         | x        |        |       |             |       |          |
|             | read   | x       | x       | x        | x      | x     | x           | x     | x        |

|             | delete | x       |         | x        |        |       |             |       |          |
| contributor | create | x       |         | x        |        |       |             |       |          |
|             | read   | x       | x       | x        | x      | x     | x           | x     | x        |
|             | update | x       |         | x        |        |       |             |       |          |
|             | delete | x       |         | x        |        |       |             |       |          |
| reader      | create |         |         |          |        |       |             |       |          |
|             | read   | x       | x       | x        | x      | x     | x           | x     | x        |
|             | update |         |         |          |        |       |             |       |          |
|             | delete |         |         |          |        |       |             |       |          |

## Users

When you configured your Azure subscription, you also enabled BigAnimal to authenticate users from your organization using Azure AD. Before users become visible in the BigAnimal **Users** screen, they need to sign in using Azure AD after receiving special emails from your organization. New users signed in to BigAnimal have a minimum set of permissions until you assign them a role.

4.  Select or clear roles for the user.

!!! Note
    For a user's role assignment to take effect, the user must log out from BigAnimal and log in again.

### View users

You can view all users from your organization who have logged in at least once.

1.  Navigate to **Admin > Users**.

2.  View the list of users sorted by most recent login.

## Example scenario

1.  The BigAnimal organization is created, and Tom logs in and is granted the owner role.

2.  Tom asks Jerry to log in, using his Azure AD account. Jerry's account in BigAnimal is created.

3.  Tom grants Sally the contributor role. Sally logs out and back in. She can now create BigAnimal clusters.

4.  Sally asks Jerry to log in and grants him the reader role.

5.  Jerry logs out and back in. He can now see the clusters that Sally created.
