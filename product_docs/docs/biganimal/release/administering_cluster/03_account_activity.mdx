The activity log collects BigAnimal events based on user activity in the portal. You can use the log to audit activities performed by users from your organizations or research activities that might have affected your account.

## Events

Events describe actions performed by users. The available actions are:

-   create
-   read
-   update
-   delete

Events are related to the following resource types:

-   cluster
-   data plane
-   user
-   user roles
-   role permissions
-   organization

!!! Note
    Database events are not logging activity on the Postgres server. They are logging the use of the portal to create or modify database clusters.
