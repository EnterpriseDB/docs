Projects are a group of database clusters within a BigAnimal organization. Access to projects is controlled by a user's role. With projects, you can separate workflows to provide secure and isolated environments and assign different users to different projects. See [Managing portal access](/biganimal/release/administering_cluster/01_portal_access) for more information.

Projects actions are available from the left navigation bar. The actions apply to the project in focus. You can switch between projects using the **Projects** menu.

## Adding a user to a project
Before adding a user to a project: 
- The user must be added to the organization through the organization's identity provider.
- The user must log in to the BigAnimal portal at least once.
- You must be an organization owner or the project owner.

To add a user: 
1. From the **Projects** menu, select the project you want to add a user to.
1.  From the left navigation bar, select **Users**.
2.  Select the edit icon for the user.
3.  Select **Assign Roles**.
4.  Depending on the level of access you want for the user, select the appropriate role.
5.  Select **Submit**.

You can enable in-app inbox or email notifications to get alerted when a user is invited to a project. For more information, see [managing notifications](notifications/#manage-notifications).

## Creating a project

Before creating a project: 

- You must have an organization owner role.

- You must create a new Azure subscription or AWS account. For Google Cloud, you don't need to do so. 

  - To create a new Azure subscription, see [Create a Microsoft Customer Agreement subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscription).

  - To create a new AWS account, see [Creating an AWS account in your organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html).

  !!!noteNotes
     - You can use a single Azure subscription or AWS account for only one project at a time. For example, if you have two projects and only need to deploy your clusters in AWS, you need to connect a different AWS account for each project.

     - To reuse an Azure subscription or AWS account, you must first delete the project that was previously connected with that account.

- For Google Cloud, you must create a new Google Cloud project for each BigAnimal project. To create a new Google Cloud project, see [Creating and managing projects](https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects). 

  !!! Note
      Google Cloud assigns a quota to the number of Google Cloud projects based on your account type. If your account has reached its limit, you can complete a [Request Project Quota Increase](https://support.google.com/code/contact/project_quota_increase) form or schedule for some projects to be deleted.  

To create a new project:

1. Select **Projects > Create New Project**.
1. In the **Project Name** field, enter a unique name.
1. Optionally, under **Tags*, select **+**.
1. To assign an existing tag, in the search bar under **Tags**, enter a tag name. To add a new tag, instead select **+ Add Tag**.
1. Select **Create New Project**.
1. Select **Project > See All Projects**.
1. Select your new project.
1. Set up the cloud provider for the project. See [Connecting your cloud](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/02_connecting_to_your_cloud/).
1. Activate the region for the project. See [Activating regions](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/activating_regions/).
1. Select **Create Project**.

1. To finalize the configuration, select **Add Key**.

!!!note Note for GCP keys
   If the key you added was created in a Google Cloud Platform account different from the TDE-enabled cluster you want to create, ensure you enable the [Cloud KMS API](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs/create-encryption-keys#before-you-begin) in the Google console before assigning it to your cluster in BigAnimal.

Now, use this TDE key to [create a cluster](/biganimal/release/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#security).

For more information about TDE support, see [Transparent Data Encryption](../overview/03_security#your-own-encryption-key---transparent-data-encryption-tde)

## Deleting a TDE key 

1. From the Projects page, select an existing project.

1. Go to **Settings** on the left-side navigation.

1. From the **Settings** list, select **Security**.
