Projects are a group of database clusters within a BigAnimal organization. Access to projects is controlled by a user's role. With projects, you can separate workflows to provide secure and isolated environments and assign different users to different projects. See [Managing portal access](/biganimal/release/administering_cluster/01_portal_access) for more information.

Projects actions are available from the left navigation bar. The actions apply to the project in focus. You can switch between projects using the **Projects** menu.

## Adding a user to a project
Before adding a user to a project: 
- The user must be added to the organization through the organization's identity provider.
- The user must log in to the BigAnimal portal at least once.
- You must be an organization owner or the project owner.

To add a user: 
1. From the **Projects** menu, select the project you want to add a user to.
1.  From the left navigation bar, select **Users**.
2.  Select the edit icon for the user.
3.  Select **Assign Roles**.
4.  Depending on the level of access you want for the user, select the appropriate role.
5.  Select **Submit**.


## Creating a project

Before creating a project: 

- You must have an organization owner role.

- You must create a new Azure subscription or AWS account. 

  - To create a new Azure subscription, see [Create a Microsoft Customer Agreement subscription](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/manage/create-subscription).

  - To create a new AWS account, see [Creating an AWS account in your organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_create.html).

  !!!noteNotes
     - You can use a single Azure subscription or AWS account for only one project at a time. For example, if you have two projects and only need to deploy your clusters in AWS, you need to connect a different AWS account for each project.

     - To reuse an Azure subscription or AWS account, you must first delete the project that was previously connected with that account.

To create a new project:

1. Select **Projects > New Project**.
1. Enter a unique name for the project.
1. Select **Create Project**.
1. Select **Project > See All Projects**.
1. Select your new project.
1. Set up the cloud provider for the project. See [Connecting your cloud](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/02_connecting_to_your_cloud/).
1. Activate the region for the project. See [Activating regions](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/activating_regions/).
1. Select **Create Project**.
