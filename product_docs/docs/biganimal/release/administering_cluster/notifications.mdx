## Configuring notifications

The project owners/editors and organization owners/admins can configure the notifications for the events visible to them. They can choose if they want to receive notifications in the in-app inbox, by email, or both. They can also configure email notifications for their teams in their organization. 

Project-level notifications are configured in the project.

Notification settings made by a user apply only to that user. If an email notification is enabled, the email is sent to the email address associated with the user's login.

## Viewing notifications

Users in the following roles can view the notifications:
- Organization owners can view the organization notifications. 
- Project owners/editors can view the project notifications.
- User can view their own account notifications. 

For the user having multiple roles in BigAnimal, each notification indicates the level and project it belongs to.
