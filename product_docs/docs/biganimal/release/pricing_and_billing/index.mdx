title: "Pricing and billing "

This section covers the pricing breakdown for BigAnimal as well as associated costs and how to view usage and metering information. 

## Database pricing

Pricing is based on the number of virtual central processing units (vCPUs) provisioned for the database software offering. Consumption of vCPUs is metered hourly. A deployment is made up of either one instance or one primary and two replica instances of either PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server. When high availability is enabled, multiply the number of vCPUs per instance by three to calculate the full price for all resources used. The table shows the cost breakdown:

| Database type                | Hourly price   | Monthly price\* |
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- |
| PostgreSQL                   | $0.1655 / vCPU | $120.82 / vCPU  |
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server | $0.2397 / vCPU | $174.98 / vCPU  |

\* The monthly cost is approximate and assumes 730 hours in a month. 



## Cloud infrastructure costs

EDB doesn't bill you for cloud infrastructure such as compute, storage, data transfer, monitoring, and logging whether you are connecting directly to BigAnimal through your Microsoft Azure or AWS account.

Your cloud provider bills you directly for the cloud infrastructure provisioned according to the terms of your account agreement. 
- Microsoft Azure provides invoice and usage information on the Microsoft Azure Portal billing page. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/).
- AWS provides invoice information on the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/account-billing/index.html).

## Management costs

To give you full control over your data, BigAnimal deploys infrastructure in each region to manage the clusters in that region. BigAnimal doesn’t charge you for this infrastructure. Microsoft Azure and AWS bill directly for the infrastructure according to the terms of your account agreement.

If you deploy a large number of clusters in a single region, for example, more than 30, BigAnimal might deploy additional management infrastructure to support your workloads. In addition, BigAnimal provisions a number of other free resources in your account to help with management. 

If you want to remove management resources provisioned from your cloud provider, reach out to [Customer Support](../overview/06_support).

## Billing

If you are using Microsoft Azure Marketplace, all billing is handled directly by Microsoft Azure. This includes infrastructure costs as well as database costs. For database costs, Microsoft bills on actual hours in a given month. You can view invoices and usage on the Microsoft Azure Portal billing page. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/).

If you are using your own Microsoft Azure or AWS account, database billing is handled by EDB.
