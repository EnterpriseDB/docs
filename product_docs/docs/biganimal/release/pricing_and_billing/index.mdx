title: "Pricing and billing "
---

This section covers the pricing breakdown for BigAnimal as well as how to view invoices and infrastructure usage through Microsoft Azure. It also covers management costs.

## Pricing
Pricing is based on the number of Virtual Central Processing Units (vCPUs) provisioned for the database software offering. Consumption of vCPUs is metered hourly. A deployment is comprised of either one instance or one primary and two replica instances of either PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server. When high availability is enabled, the number of vCPU per instance should be multiplied by three to calculate the full price for all resources used. See the full cost breakdown below:

| Database type         | Hourly price   | Monthly price* |
| --------------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| PostgreSQL            | $0.1655 / vCPU | $120.82 / vCPU |
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server | $0.2397 / vCPU | $174.98 / vCPU |

*The monthly cost is approximate and assumes 730 hours in a month. Microsoft bills on actual hours in a given month. 

## Billing
All billing is handled directly by Microsoft Azure. Invoices and usage can be viewed on the Azure Portal billing page. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/)

## Cloud infrastructure costs
EDB does not bill you for cloud infrastructure such as compute, storage, data transfer, monitoring, and logging. BigAnimal clusters run in your Microsoft Azure account. Azure bills you directly for the cloud infrastructure provisioned according to the terms of your account agreement. Invoices and usage can be viewed on the Azure Portal billing page. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/)

## Management costs
To give you full control over your data, BigAnimal deploys infrastructure in each region to manage the clusters in that region. BigAnimal doesn’t charge you for this infrastructure. Azure bills directly for the infrastructure according to the terms of your account agreement.

The table shows a breakdown of management costs.

| Type   | Details |
|--------|---------|
| Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) | BigAnimal uses AKS to orchestrate and manage the database service Managed Kubernetes Virtual Machines provisioned on Windows and Linux. |
| Azure Monitor | BigAnimal feeds all logs and metrics to [Azure Monitor](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/05_monitoring_and_logging/). |
| Azure blob storage | BigAnimal uses blob storage to store metadata about your account. |
| Key vault | BigAnimal uses key vault to securely store credentials for managing your infrastructure. |

At list price, estimated overall management costs are $400–$700 for a single cluster. Check with your Azure account manager for specifics that apply to your account. 

If you deploy a large number of clusters in a single region, for example, more than 30, BigAnimal might deploy additional management infrastructure to support your workloads. In addition, BigAnimal provisions a number of other free resources in your account to help with management.
