The costs include database pricing for BigAnimal and the associated costs from other providers. You can also view usage and metering information. 

BigAnimal calculates the estimated monthly price for your cluster at the bottom of the page while you are [creating a cluster](/biganimal/release/getting_started/creating_a_cluster). This estimate includes database costs and, if you're using BigAnimal's cloud account, infrastructure costs.

## Database pricing 

Pricing is based on the number of virtual central processing units (vCPUs) provisioned for the database software offering. Consumption of vCPUs is metered hourly. A deployment is typically made up of either one instance or one primary and two standby replica instances of either PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server. When high-availability configurations are enabled, multiply the number of vCPUs per instance by the number of replicas configured to calculate the full price for all resources used. This table shows the cost breakdown.

| Database type                | Hourly price   | Monthly price\* | 
| ---------------------------- | -------------- | --------------- | 
| PostgreSQL                   | $0.0856 / vCPU | $62.49 / vCPU  | 
| PostgreSQL                   | $0.1655 / vCPU | $120.82 / vCPU  | 
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server | $0.2568 / vCPU | $187.46 / vCPU  | 

Extreme high availability powered by EDB Postgres Distributed is now available in preview! Contact Sales for more information about pricing.

\* The monthly cost is approximate and assumes 730 hours in a month. 
  

## Cloud infrastructure costs

If you're connecting directly to BigAnimal through BigAnimal's cloud account, EDB bills you for cloud infrastructure, such as compute, storage, data transfer, monitoring, and logging. Monthly estimates for BigAnimal's cloud infrastructure costs can be viewed while creating a cluster. 

If you're connecting directly to BigAnimal through your Microsoft Azure or AWS account, EDB doesn't bill you for cloud infrastructure, such as compute, storage, data transfer, monitoring, and logging.

Your cloud provider bills you directly for the cloud infrastructure provisioned according to the terms of your account agreement. 
- Microsoft Azure provides invoice and usage information on the Microsoft Azure Portal billing page. [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cost-management-billing/).
- AWS provides invoice information on the AWS Billing and Cost Management console. [Learn more](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/account-billing/index.html).

## Management costs

To give you full control over your data, BigAnimal deploys infrastructure in each region to manage the clusters in that region. BigAnimal charges you for this infrastructure only if you're using BigAnimal's cloud. Microsoft Azure and AWS bill directly for the infrastructure according to the terms of your account agreement.

If you deploy a large number of clusters in a single region, for example, more than 30, BigAnimal might deploy additional management infrastructure to support your workloads. In addition, BigAnimal provisions a number of other free resources in your account to help with management. 

If you want to remove management resources provisioned from your cloud provider, contact [Support](../overview/support).

## Apache Superset costs

Enabling [Apache Superset](/biganimal/latest/using_cluster/06_analyze_with_superset/) to analyze your data has an added cost. In most cases the costs are approximately $150 per month, based on your cloud provider, instance and storage type selections, and other factors.

## PgBouncer costs

Enabling [PgBouncer](../getting_started/creating_a_cluster/#pgbouncer) to pool your connections incurs additional costs that depend on your cloud provider. In addition to the cloud provider costs, PgBouncer connects to your primary server and requires an IP address. BigAnimal provisions up to three instances per PgBouncer-enabled cluster to ensure that performance is unaffected, so each availability zone receives its own instance of PgBouncer. The extra VM costs are the 2vcpu SKU times the number of PgBouncer instances. For AWS, the instance type is c5.large. For Azure, the instance type is F2s_v2.

## Payments and billing

Your payment and billing options include:

- Digital self-service using a credit card
- Direct purchase using the Sales Order Form 
- Azure Marketplace

### Digital self-service

BigAnimal charges the credit card for your [EDB account](https://www.enterprisedb.com/accounts/register) month-to-month and sends invoices to your email. This invoice includes database costs, and if you're using BigAnimal's cloud account, infrastructure costs.

!!! Note 
    If you want to take advantage of discounts, then please contact [Sales](https://info.enterprisedb.com/EDB-Contact-Us.html). 

### Direct purchase
If you are using BigAnimal's cloud account, you are invoiced on a monthly basis or you can arrange for a longer term.

If you're using your own Microsoft Azure or AWS account, usage details are included in your invoice. Account owners can download a usage report in CSV format from the BigAnimal Usage page and can set the time frame, database type, and cloud provider prior to downloading the report. The information on the page is refreshed hourly.

### Azure Marketplace
If you're using Microsoft Azure Marketplace, all billing is handled directly by Microsoft Azure. This includes infrastructure costs as well as database costs. For database costs, Microsoft bills on actual hours in a given month. You can view invoices and usage on the Microsoft Azure Portal billing page.
