## Prerequisites

Before connecting your cloud, make sure that you're assigned the following AWS managed policies or an equivalent custom policy granting full access to resources:

- arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/IAMFullAccess

- arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ServiceQuotasFullAccess

## Connecting your cloud

!!! tip
    If you're using Cloud Shell, add the `./` prefix to the `biganimal` command (`./biganimal`).
    
To connect your cloud:

1. Open the [AWS Cloud Shell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell) in your browser.

1.  Create a BigAnimal CLI credential:

   ```shell
   biganimal create-credential --name <cred> --address portal.biganimal.com --port 443
   ```

1. To set up your cloud provider, run the `setup-csp` command:

   ```shell
   biganimal setup-csp 
   ```
   The command checks for cloud account readiness and displays the results. 

1. If the following readiness checks aren't met for your cloud service provider, see [Configure your AWS account](/biganimal/release/getting_started/preparing_cloud_account/02_preparing_aws/#configure-your-aws-account) to manually configure your cloud:

   - Is the AWS CLI configured to access your AWS account?

   - Is the limit on the number of vCPUs and network load balancers (NLBs) in your region enough for your clusters?

   If the cloud readiness checks pass, your cloud account is successfully set up. 
   
1.  Connect your cloud account to BigAnimal:

   ```shell
   biganimal connect-csp --provider aws --project <project-name>
   ```
 After your cloud account is successfully connected to BigAnimal, you and other users with the correct permissions can create clusters.
