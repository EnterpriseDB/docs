Before connecting to your cloud, you must set permissions to allow BigAnimal to perform maintenance operations in your cloud.

* **If connecting to Azure**:
    Register an application with Azure AD and create a service principal to delegate Identity and Access Management functions to Azure Active Directory (AD).

* **If connecting to AWS**:
    Create a role EDBOperations and set its *policy/trust* and *policy/policy* boundaries to * with EDB's AWS account. This allows EDB's IAM users to assume the EDBOperations role in your AWS account.

BigAnimal CLI commands used in the procedures in [Connect your cloud to BigAnimal](#connect-your-cloud-to-biganimal) automatically set these permissions for you. 

## Connect your cloud to BigAnimal

How you connect your cloud to BigAnimal depends on if you purchased BigAnimal from the Azure Marketplace or if you purchased it directly from EDB and are connecting your own cloud account.
