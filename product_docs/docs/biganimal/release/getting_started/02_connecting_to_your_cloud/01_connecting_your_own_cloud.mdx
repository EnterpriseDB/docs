You can connect BigAnimal to your own Azure subscription or AWS account. To connect to your own cloud account, EDB provides a command that automatically sets up your account.
 
## Setting up and connecting your cloud service provider

**Prerequisites**:

Before setting up your cloud account, ensure that:

 - **If connecting to an AWS account:** 

   You are assigned the following AWS managed policies (or an equivalent custom policy granting full access to resources):

    - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/IAMFullAccess

    - arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/ServiceQuotasFullAccess
    
 - **If connecting to an Azure subscription:** 
 
   You are assigned either of the following roles in Azure AD:

    - Global Administrator

    - Privileged Role Administrator

 - In [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) or [AWS Cloud Shell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell), your environment is running: 

      - bash shell version 4.0 or above. 

      - [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) JSON parser.
      - BigAnimal CLI version 1.4 or later. For detailed steps, see [Installing the CLI](../../reference/cli/#installing-the-cli).

 - The BigAnimal login user running the CLI is assigned either the owner or the contributor role.
   
Perform the following steps:

1. Open the [Azure Cloud Shell](https://shell.azure.com/) or the [AWS Cloud Shell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell) in your browser. 

1. Log in to BigAnimal as a user with either the owner or the contributor role.
   
   ```
   biganimal create-credential --name <UserLogin> --address portal.biganimal.com --port 443
   ```

1. Run the `setup-csp` command to set up your cloud provider. The synatx is:
   
    ```
    setup-csp --provider 
          {--account-id | --subscription-id}
          --region
          [--instance-type --high-availability --networking | --skip-preflight]
          [--run]
    ```
   
   Here is an example of setting up an AWS account:

    ```
   biganimal setup-csp --provider aws --account-id 123456789102  --region us-east-1 --instance-type aws:r5.large --high-availability --networking private --run
   ```

   Here is an example if setting up an Azure account:
    ```
   biganimal setup-csp --provider azure --subscription-id abc12345-1234-1234-abcd-12345678901 --region eastus --instance-type azure:Standard_E4s_v3 --high-availability --networking private --run
   ```
  
   For more information on the command arguments, run the following command:

   ```
   biganimal setup-csp --help
   ```        
   
   Alternatively, you can enable the CLI interactive mode to have the CLI guide you through the process:
   ```
   biganimal config set interactive_mode on
   biganimal setup-csp
   ```
  
1. The command checks for cloud account readiness and displays the results. If requirements are not met and you need more information about the requirements, see [Preparing your Azure subscription](../preparing_cloud_account/01_preparing_azure/#configure-your-azure-subscription) or [Preparing your AWS account](../preparing_cloud_account/02_preparing_aws/#configure-your-aws-account). 

	
1. If the cloud readiness checks pass, your cloud account is successfully set up. Connect your cloud account to BigAnimal with following command. 
   ```
   biganimal connect-csp --provider  <cloud-service-provider> 
   ```

Once your cloud account is successfully connected to BigAnimal, you and other users can log in using your identity provider credentials.
