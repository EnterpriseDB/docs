title: Creating an extreme high-availability cluster
---

When you create an extreme high-availability cluster, you need to set up the data group. Extreme high-availability clusters can contain one or two data groups. 

1.  Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal.

1.  Select **Create New Cluster** in the top right of the **Overview** page or **Clusters** page.

1. In the **Cluster info** tab, select **Extreme High Availability**. 

1. Select **Next: Cluster Settings**. 

1. In the **Cluster Settings** tab, enter your cluster name and password. 

1. Select **Next: Data Groups**. 

1. Go to the **Nodes Settings** tab. 

1. In the **Nodes** section, choose between **Two Data Nodes** and **Three Data Nodes**. The default for one data group is three data nodes. For more information on node architecture, see [Extreme High Availability](/biganimal/latest/overview/02_high_availability/#extreme-high-availability-preview).

1. In the **Database Type** section:

   1.  Select the type of Postgres you want to use in the **Postgres Type** field:

        -   **Oracle Compatible** is powered by [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/). View [a quick demonstration of Oracle compatibility on BigAnimal](../../using_cluster/06_demonstration_oracle_compatibility). EDB Postgres Advanced Server is compatible with all three cluster types.

        -   **PostgreSQL Compatible** uses advanced logical replication of data and schema. 
    
    1.  In the **Postgres Version** list, select the version of Postgres that you want to use. See [Database version policy](../../overview/05_database_version_policy) for more information.

1. Choose the settings for your cluster according to [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/). Find the instructions for **Node Settings** in the [Cluster Settings tab](../creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) section and the [Additional Settings tab](../creating_a_cluster/#additional-settings-tab) section. Find instructions for the **DB Configuration** tab in the [DB Configuration tab](../creating_a_cluster/#db-configuration-tab) section.

1. Select **Create: Data Group** and the data group preview appears. 

1. To finish creating your cluster, select **Create Cluster**. If you want to create a second data group, select **Add a Data Group**.

## Create a second data group

After creating your first cluster, you can create a second data group for your extreme high-availability cluster by selecting **Add a Data Group** on the cluster preview page before you create the cluster. The settings for your first data group pre-populate the second data group's settings. However, if you wish to change any of these settings you can, just know that they can change the settings for the entire cluster.
