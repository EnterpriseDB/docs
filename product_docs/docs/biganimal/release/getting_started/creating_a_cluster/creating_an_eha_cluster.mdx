title: Creating an extreme-high-availability cluster
---

When you create an extreme-high-availability cluster, you need to set up the data group. Extreme-high-availability clusters can contain one or two data groups. 

1. After specifying **Extreme High Availability** as your cluster type on the **Cluster Info** tab and your cluster name and password on the **Cluster Settings** tab, select **Next: Data Groups**. 

1. On the **Nodes Settings** tab, in the **Nodes** section, select **Two Data Nodes** or **Three Data Nodes**.  

     For more information on node architecture, see [Extreme high availability (Preview)](/biganimal/latest/overview/02_high_availability/#extreme-high-availability-preview).

1. In the **Database Type** section:

   1.  Select the type of Postgres you want to use in the **Postgres Type** field:

        -  **[EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/)** is EDB's Oracle-compatible database offering. View [a quick demonstration of Oracle compatibility on BigAnimal](../../using_cluster/06_demonstration_oracle_compatibility).

        - **[EDB Postgres Extended Server](/pge/latest/)** is EDB's advanced logical replication, PostgreSQL-compatible database offering. 
    
    1.  In the **Postgres Version** list, select either 14 or 15 as the version of Postgres that you want to use. 

1. Select the settings for your cluster according to [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/). Find the instructions for the **Node Settings** tab in [Cluster Settings tab](../creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) and [Additional Settings tab](../creating_a_cluster/#additional-settings-tab).

1. In the **Parameters** section on the **DB Configuration** tab, you can update the value of the database configuration parameters for the data group as needed.

    To update the parameter values, see [Modifying your database configuration parameters](../../using_cluster/03_modifying_your_cluster/05_db_configuration_parameters).

1. Select **Create: Data Group**. The data group preview appears. 

1. To finish creating your cluster, select **Create Cluster**. If you want to create a second data group, select **Add a Data Group**.

## Creating a second data group

After creating the first data group, you can create a second data group for your extreme-high-availability cluster by selecting **Add a Data Group** before you create the cluster. 

By default, the settings for your first data group populate the second data group's settings. However, if you want to change certain settings you can. Just know that your changes can change the settings for the entire cluster. That being said, the database type and cloud provider must be consistent across both data groups. The data groups and the witness group must all be in different regions. Otherwise, you can choose the second data group's settings as needed. 

When choosing the number of data nodes for the second data group, see [Extreme high availability (Preview)](/biganimal/latest/overview/02_high_availability/#extreme-high-availability-preview) for information on node architecture.

!!! Note
     To maintain high availability, BigAnimal doesn't allow the maintenance windows of data groups to overlap.
