title: Creating an extreme high-availability cluster
---

When you create an extreme high-availability cluster, you need to set up the data group. Extreme high-availability clusters can contain one or two data groups. 

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal.

1. Select **Create New Cluster** in the top right of the **Overview** page or **Clusters** page.

1. In the **Cluster info** tab, select **Extreme High Availability**. 

1. Select **Next: Cluster Settings**. 

1. In the **Cluster Settings** tab, enter your cluster name and password. 

1. Select **Next: Data Groups**. 

1. Go to the **Nodes Settings** tab. 

1. In the **Nodes** section, choose between **Two Data Nodes** and **Three Data Nodes**. The default for one data group is three data nodes. For more information on node architecture, see [Extreme high availability (Preview)](/biganimal/latest/overview/02_high_availability/#extreme-high-availability-preview).

1. In the **Database Type** section:

   1.  Select the type of Postgres you want to use in the **Postgres Type** field:

        -   **Oracle Compatible** is powered by [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/). View [a quick demonstration of Oracle compatibility on BigAnimal](../../using_cluster/06_demonstration_oracle_compatibility). EDB Postgres Advanced Server is compatible with all three cluster types.

        -   **PostgreSQL Compatible** is powered by [EDB Postgres Extended Server](/pge/latest/), which uses advanced logical replication of data and schema. 

        !!! Note
            Only PostgreSQL compatible works with the EDB Postgres Distributed [Commit Scopes](../../overview/02_high_availability/#commit-scopes) feature.
    
    1.  In the **Postgres Version** list, select the version of Postgres that you want to use. See [Database version policy](../../overview/05_database_version_policy) for more information.

1. Choose the settings for your cluster according to [Creating a cluster](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/creating_a_cluster/). Find the instructions for **Node Settings** tab in the [Cluster Settings tab](../creating_a_cluster/#cluster-settings-tab) section and the [Additional Settings tab](../creating_a_cluster/#additional-settings-tab) section. Find instructions for the **DB Configuration** tab in the [DB Configuration tab](../creating_a_cluster/#db-configuration-tab) section.

1. Select **Create: Data Group** and the data group preview appears. 

1. To finish creating your cluster, select **Create Cluster**. If you want to create a second data group, select **Add a Data Group**.

## Create a second data group

After creating the first data group, you can create a second data group for your extreme high-availability cluster by selecting **Add a Data Group** before you create the cluster. 

By default, the settings for your first data group pre-populate the second data group's settings. However, if you wish to change certain settings you can, just know that they can change the settings for the entire cluster. That being said, the database type and cloud provider must be consistent across both data groups. The data groups and the witness group must all be in different regions. Otherwise, you can choose the second data group's settings as needed. 

When choosing the number of data nodes for the second data group, refer to [Extreme high availability (Preview)](/biganimal/latest/overview/02_high_availability/#extreme-high-availability-preview) for information on node architecture.
