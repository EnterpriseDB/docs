## Create a cluster

1.  Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal.

1.  Select **Create New Cluster** in the top right of the **Overview** page or **Clusters** page.
1.  On the **Create Cluster** page, specify the cluster settings on the following tabs:
    -   [**Cluster Info**](#cluster-info-tab)

    -   [**Cluster Settings**](#cluster-settings-tab)
    -   [**DB Configuration** ](#db-configuration-tab) (optional)
    -   [**Backups**](#backups-tab) (optional)
1.  Select **Create Cluster**. It might take a few minutes to deploy.

!!! Note
    When you don't configure settings on optional tabs, the default values are used.

### Cluster Info tab 

1. Select which type of cluster to deploy. 

     - [Single node](/biganimal/latest/overview/02_high_availability/#single-node) creates a cluster with one primary and no standby replicas. Suited for test environments where high availability might not be required. You can create single node clusters running EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL. 

    -  [High availability](/biganimal/latest/overview/02_high_availability/#high-availability) creates a cluster with one primary and one or two standby replicas in different availability zones. You can create high availability clusters running EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL. Only high availability clusters allow you to enable read-only connections for users. However, if you enable read-only connections, then you may have to raise the IP address resource limits for the cluster. 

    -  [Extreme high availability (beta)](/biganimal/latest/overview/02_high_availability/#extreme-high-availability-beta) creates a cluster configured with a leader node, three shadow nodes, and one witness node. This cluster uses EDB Postgres Distributed to deliver higher performance and faster recovery. You can create extreme high availability clusters with either PostgreSQL or Oracle compatibility. 
    
    See [Supported cluster types](/biganimal/latest/overview/02_high_availability/) for more information about the different cluster types.

    !!! Note
       You can't switch from a single node or high availability cluster to an extreme high availability cluster or vice versa. 

1. Select the number of standby replicas for your cluster. 

1. Select the cloud provider for your cluster. If you're using your own account and haven't connected it to BigAnimal yet, see [Connecting to your cloud](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/02_connecting_to_your_cloud).

### Cluster Settings tab

1.  Enter the name for your cluster in the **Cluster Name** field.

1.  Enter a password for your cluster in the **Password** field. This is the password for the user edb_admin.
1.  In the **Database Type** section:

    1.  Select the type of Postgres you want to use in the **Postgres Type** field:

        -   **Oracle Compatible** is powered by [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/). View [a quick demonstration of Oracle compatibility on BigAnimal](../../using_cluster/06_demonstration_oracle_compatibility). EDB Postgres Advanced Server is compatible with all three cluster types.

        -   **[PostgreSQL](/supported-open-source/postgresql/)** is an open-source object-relational database management system. PostgreSQL is compatible with single node and high availability cluster types.

        -   **PostgreSQL Compatible** uses advanced logical replication of data and schema. It is only available if you select extreme high availability as your cluster type.
    
    1.  In the **Postgres Version** list, select the version of Postgres that you want to use. See [Database version policy](../../overview/05_database_version_policy) for more information.

1.  In the **Region** section, select the region where you want to deploy your cluster. For the best performance, EDB strongly recommends that this region be the same as your other resources that communicate with your cluster. For a list of available regions, see [Supported regions](../../overview/03a_region_support). If you are interested in deploying a cluster to a region that isn't currently available, contact [Support](docs/biganimal/latest/overview/support/).
1.  In the **Instance Type** section, 

    1. Select the category that works best for your applications and workload: 
       - Memory optimized for large data sets
       
       - Compute optimized for compute bound applications
       - General purpose if you don't require memory or compute optimization. 
    1. Select the instance series and size. See [Sizes for virtual machines in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes) or [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) for information to help you choose the appropriate instance type. 
       !!!tip
       To maximize your disk size for AWS, select Rb5 as your instance, and then io2 Block Express as your storage to get a maximum disk size of 64 TB and 256,000 IOPS.
  
1.  In the **Storage** section, select your volume type from the **Volume Type** list. 
       - For Azure, in **Volume Type** select either Premium SSD or Ultra Disk. Compared to Premium SSD volumes, Ultra Disks offer lower latency, high-performance options, and direct control over your disk's IOPS (input/output operations per second). BigAnimal recommends using Ultra Disks for workloads that require the most demanding performance. See [Using Azure ultra disks](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-enable-ultra-ssd?tabs=azure-portal) for more information. 
          - For Premium SSD, in **Volume Properties**, select the type and amount of storage needed for your cluster. See [Azure Premium SSD storage types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types#premium-ssds) for more information. 

          - For Ultra Disk, in **Volume Properties**, select the disk size and IOPS for your cluster. BigAnimal calculates the throughput based on your IOPS settings. 

           !!!important
           While setting the required IOPS for the disk you should consider the VM limits that are tied to the VM size that you have selected. See [Ultra disk IOPS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types#ultra-disk-iops) for more information.

       - For AWS, in **Volume Type** select either General Purpose SSD (GP3), io2, or io2 Block Express.
      
       !!!Note
       io2 Block Express is available for selected instance types (such as R5b). However, you cannot switch between io2 and io2 Block Express after creating your cluster.
       !!!  
     
        In **Volume Properties**, select the disk size for your cluster and configure the IOPS.
    
1.  In the **Connections** section, you can enable Read-only Connections. This feature directs read-only operations exclusively towards replicas. If enabled, you may have to raise the IP address resource limits for the cluster:

      - For Azure, the IP address quota is Standard Public IP Address.

      - For AWS, the IP address quota is Elastic IP. You may also have to increase the Network Load Balancers per Region. 

    What to be aware of when enabling read-only connections:
    
      - Read-only connections are routed to Postgres physical standbys. Commands run on read-only connections aren't filtered by BigAnimal. The connection is read-only because it runs on a read-replica where Postgres doesn't permit changes to the contents of database tables. A privileged connection to a read replica can still execute other sensitive commands permitted by Postgres on read replicas, like modify replication slots or Postgres configuration settings, terminate backends, see activity from other users, and more. We recommend that you use a Postgres role with minimal privileges for your application, even for read-only connections.

      - Advisory locks aren't replicated between Postgres nodes, so advisory locks taken on a read-replica don't conflict with advisory locks taken on the primary or another read-replica.  We recommend that applications which rely on advisory locking avoid using read-only connections for those transactions.

1.  In the **Networking Connectivity** section, you specify whether to use private or public networking. Networking is set to **Public** by default. Public means that any client can connect to your cluster’s public IP address over the internet. Optionally, you can limit traffic to your public cluster by specifying an IP allowlist, which allows access only to certain blocks of IP addresses. To limit access, add one or more classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) blocks in the **IP Allowlists** section. CIDR is a method for allocating IP addresses and IP routing to a whole network or subnet. If you have any CIDR block entries, access is limited to those IP addresses. If none are specified, all network traffic is allowed. 

    Private networking allows only IP addresses within your private network to connect to your cluster. See [Cluster networking architecture](01_cluster_networking) for more information.

1.  To optionally make updates to your database configuration parameters, select **Next: DB Configuration**.

### DB Configuration tab

In the **Parameters** section, you can update the value of the database configuration parameters, as needed. 

To update the parameter values, see [Modifying Your Database Configuration Parameters](../../using_cluster/03_modifying_your_cluster/05_db_configuration_parameters).

### Backups tab
You can change the default database backup retention period of 30 days using the **Retention Time** controls in the **Backups** section. You can configure the retention period as follows:

 - 1 - 180 days
 - 1 - 25 weeks
 - 1 - 6 months

BigAnimal automatically deletes backups older than the retention period.
