!!!Note
Prior to creating your cluster, make sure you have enough resources. Without enough resources, your request to create a cluster fails. 
- If your cloud provider is Azure, see [Preparing your Azure account](../01_check_resource_limits).
- If your cloud provider is AWS, see [Preparing your AWS account](../preparing_cloud_account/02_preparing_aws).

## Create a cluster

1.  Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal.

2.  Select **Create New Cluster** in the top right of the **Overview** page or **Clusters** page.
3.  On the **Create Cluster** page, specify the cluster settings on the following tabs:
    -   [**Cluster Settings**](#cluster-settings-tab)

    -   [**DB Configuration** ](#db-configuration-tab) (optional)
    -   [ **Availability** ](#availability-tab) (optional)
4.  Select **Create Cluster**. It might take a few minutes to deploy.

!!! Note
    When you don't configure settings on optional tabs, the default values are used.

### Cluster Settings tab

1.  Enter the name for your cluster in the **Cluster Name** field.

2.  Enter a password for your cluster in the **Password** field. This is the password for the user edb_admin.
1.  In the **Database Type** section:

    1.  Select the type of Postgres you want to use in the **Postgres Type** field:

        -   [*PostgreSQL*](/supported-open-source/postgresql/) is an open-source object-relational database management system.

        -   [*EDB Postgres Advanced Server*](/epas/latest/) is EDB’s secure, Oracle-compatible PostgreSQL. View [a quick demonstration of Oracle compatibility on BigAnimal](../../using_cluster/06_demonstration_oracle_compatibility).
    2.  In the **Postgres Version** list, select the version of Postgres that you want to use. See [Database version policy](../../overview/05_database_version_policy) for more information.
2.  In the **Provider** section, select the cloud provider for your cluster. If you're using your own account and haven't connected it to BigAnimal yet, see [Set up your cloud service provider](/biganimal/latest/getting_started/02_connecting_to_your_cloud/01_connecting_your_own_cloud/#setting-up-your-cloud-service-provider).
3.  In the **Region** section, select the region where you want to deploy your cluster. For the best performance, EDB typically recommends that this region be the same as your other resources that communicate with your cluster. For a list of available regions, see [Supported regions](../../overview/03a_region_support).
4.  In the **Instance Type** section, 
    1. Select the category that works best for your applications and workload: 
       - Memory optimized for large data sets
       - Compute optimized for compute bound applications
       - General purpose if you don't require memory or compute optimization. 
    2. Select the instance series and size. 
       - See [Sizes for virtual machines in Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/sizes) or [Amazon EC2 Instance Types](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/) for information to help you choose the appropriate instance type. 
  
5.  In the **Storage** section, select your volume type from the **Volume Type** list. 
    - For Azure, BigAnimal currently supports Azure Premium SSD storage types. In **Volume Properties**, select the type and amount of storage needed for your cluster. See [the Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types#premium-ssds) for more information. 

    - For AWS, BigAnimal currently supports General Purpose SSD (GP3) storage. In **Volume Properties**, select the disk size for your cluster. 

6.  In the **Networking Connectivity** section, you specify whether to use private or public networking. Networking is set to **Public** by default. Public means that any client can connect to your cluster’s public IP address over the internet. Optionally, you can limit traffic to your public cluster by specifying an IP allowlist, which allows access only to certain blocks of IP addresses. To limit access, add one or more classless inter-domain routing (CIDR) blocks in the **IP Allowlists** section. CIDR is a method for allocating IP addresses and IP routing to a whole network or subnet. If you have any CIDR block entries, access is limited to those IP addresses. If none are specified, all network traffic is allowed. 

    Private networking allows only IP addresses within your private network to connect to your cluster. See [Cluster networking architecture](01_cluster_networking) for more information.
7.  To optionally make updates to your database configuration parameters, select **Next: DB Configuration**.

### DB Configuration tab

In the **Parameters** section, you can update the value of the database configuration parameters, as needed. 

To update the parameter values, see [Modifying Your Database Configuration Parameters](../../using_cluster/03_modifying_your_cluster/05_db_configuration_parameters).

### Availability tab

 Enable or disable high availability using the **High Availability** control. High availability is enabled by default.
 When high availability is enabled, clusters are configured with one primary and two replicas with synchronous streaming replication.
 Clusters are configured across availability zones in regions with availability zones. When high availability is disabled, only one instance is provisioned.
 See [Supported Architectures](../../overview/02_high_availability) for more information.

After you create your cluster, use these resources to learn about cluster use and management:
