!!! Note
Prior to creating your cluster, make sure you have adequate Azure resources or your request to create a cluster will fail. See [Raising your Azure resource limits](../01_check_resource_limits).

## Create a cluster

1. Sign in to the [BigAnimal](https://portal.biganimal.com) portal.

3. Select **Create New Cluster** in the top right of the **Overview** page or **Clusters** page.
4. On the **Create Cluster** page, specify the cluster settings on the following tabs:
   - [**Cluster Info**](#cluster-info-tab)

   - [**Operational Settings**](#operational-settings-tab)
   - [**DB Configuration** ](#db-configuration-tab) (optional)
   - [ **Availability** ](#availability-tab) (optional)

8. Select **Create Cluster**. It might take a few minutes to deploy.

!!! Note
    When you don't configure settings on optional tabs, the default values are used.

### Cluster Info tab
1. Enter the name for your cluster in the **Cluster Name** field.

2. Enter a password for your cluster in the **Password** field. This is the password for the user edb_admin.
3. Select **Next: Operational Settings**. 

### Operational Settings tab
1. In the **Database Type** section:
   1. Select the type of Postgres you want to use in the **Postgres Type** field:
      - [*PostgreSQL*](/supported-open-source/postgresql/) is an open-source object-relational database management system.

      - [*EDB Postgres Advanced Server*](/epas/latest/) is EDB’s secure, Oracle-compatible PostgreSQL. View [a quick demonstration of Oracle compatibility on EDB Cloud](../../using_cluster/06_demonstration_oracle_compatibility).

   2. In the **Version** field, select the version of Postgres that you want to use. See [Database Version Policy](../../overview/05_database_version_policy) for more information.
2. In the **Provider** field, select the cloud provider for your cluster.
   !!! Note
       Microsoft Azure is the only option for the Preview.
3. In the **Region** field, select the region where you want to deploy your cluster. For the best performance, EDB typically recommends that this region be the same as other resources you have that communicate with your cluster.
4. In the **Instance Type** section, select the number of vCPUs and amount of memory you want.
5. In the **Storage** section, select **Volume Type**. In **Volume Properties**, select the type and amount of storage needed for your cluster.
   !!! Note
       BigAnimal currently supports Azure Premium SSD storage types. See [the Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/disks-types#premium-ssds) for more information.
6. In the **Networking** section, specify whether to use private or public networking. Networking is set to Public by default. Public means that any client can connect to your cluster’s public IP address over the internet. 
Private networking allows only IP addresses in your private network to connect to your cluster. See [Cluster networking architecture](01_cluster_networking) for more information.
7. To make any updates to your database configuration parameters, select **Next: DB Configuration**.

### DB Configuration tab
In the **Parameters** section, you can update the value of the database configuration parameters, as needed. 

To update the parameter values, see [Modifying Your Database Configuration Parameters](../../using_cluster/03_modifying_your_cluster/05_db_configuration_parameters).



### Availability tab
 Enable or disable high availability using the **High Availability** control. High availability is enabled by default.
 When high availability is enabled, clusters are configured with one primary and two replicas with synchronous streaming replication.
 Clusters are configured across availability zones in regions with availability zones. When high availability is disabled, only one instance is provisioned.
 See [Supported Architectures](../../overview/02_high_availability) for more information.
