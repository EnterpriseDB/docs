Follow these BigAnimal requirements and recommended resource limits in Google Cloud.


## vCPU limits

Any time a new VM is deployed in Azure, the vCPUs for the VMs must not exceed the total vCPU limits for the region.

The number of cores required by the database cluster depends on the instance type and cluster type of the clusters. For exampe, if you create cluster with ESv3 instance type, you can calculate the number of ESv3 cores required for your cluster based on the following:

-   A virtual machine instance of type E{N}sv3 uses {N} cores. For example, an instance of type E64sv3 uses 64 ESv3 cores.
-   A cluster running on an E{N}sv3 instance without HA enabled uses exactly {N} ESv3 cores.
-   A cluster running on an E{N}sv3 instance with HA enabled and 2 replicas uses 3 \* {N} ESv3 cores.

BigAnimal requires an additional eight Dv4 virtual machine cores per region for management resources. 

BigAnimal requires an additional six Dv4 virtual machine cores per region for periodic maintenance upgrades.

### Recommended limits

BigAnimal recommends the following per region when requesting virtual machine resource limit increases:

-   Total Regional vCPUs: minimum of 50 per designated region
-   Standard Dv4 Family vCPUs: minimum of 14 per designated region
-   Other Family vCPUs: depending on the instance type, cluster type, and number of clusters.
