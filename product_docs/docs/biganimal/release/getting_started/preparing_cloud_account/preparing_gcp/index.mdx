title: Preparing your Google Cloud account 
---

BigAnimal requires you to check the readiness of your Google Cloud (GCP) account before you deploy your clusters. (You don't need to perform this check if you're using BigAnimal's cloud account as your [deployment option](/biganimal/release/overview/deployment_options).) The checks that you perform ensure that your Google Cloud account is prepared to meet your clusters' requirements and resource limits.

## Required roles

Ensure you have at least the following combined roles:
- roles/iam.serviceAccountCreator
- roles/iam.serviceAccountKeyAdmin
- roles/iam.roleAdmin
- roles/resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin
- roles/compute.viewer

Or an equivalent single role such as:
- roles/owner


## Check Google Cloud resource limits for running BigAnimal

EDB provides a shell script, called [biganimal-csp-preflight](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-utilities/blob/main/gcp/biganimal-csp-preflight), which checks whether requirements and resource limits are met in your Google Cloud account based on the clusters you plan to deploy.

1.  Open [Google Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell) in your browser.
2.  From Google Cloud Shell, run the following command:

    ```shell
    curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-utilities/main/gcp/biganimal-csp-preflight | bash -s <GCP-account-ID> <region> [options]
    ```
    The required arguments are:

    | Argument | Description |
    | -------- | ----------- |
    | &lt;account-id> | Google Cloud account ID of your BigAnimal deployment. |
    | &lt;region> | Google Cloud region where your clusters are being deployed. See [Supported regions](../../overview/03a_region_support/#supported-google-cloud-regions) for a list of possible regions. |

    Possible options are:

    | Options | Description |
    | ------- | ----------- |
    | `-h` or `--help`| Displays the command help. |
    | `-i` or `--instance-type` | Google Cloud instance type for the BigAnimal cluster. The help command provides a list of possible VM instance types. Choose the instance type that best suits your application and workload. Choose an instance type in the memory optimized M1, M2, or M3 series for large data sets. Choose from the compute-optimized C2 or C2D series for compute-bound applications. Choose from the accelerator-optimized A2 or A2 ultra for massively parallelized Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) workloads. Choose from the general purpose M5 or M6I series if you don't require memory or compute optimization.|
    | `-a` or `--high-availability` | *DEPRECATED* - Enables high availability for the cluster. See [Supported cluster types(../../overview/02_high_availability) for more information.|
    | `-x` or `--cluster-architecture` | Defines the Cluster architecture and can be `single`, `ha`, or `eha`. See [Supported cluster types](/biganimal/release/overview/02_high_availability) for more information.|
    | `-e` or `--endpoint` | Type of network endpoint for the BigAnimal cluster, either `public` or `private`. See [Cluster networking architecture](../creating_a_cluster/01_cluster_networking) for more information. |
    | `-r` or `--activate-region` | Specifies region activation if no clusters currently exist in the region. |
    | `--onboard` | Checks if the user and subscription are correctly configured.

    The behavior of the script defaults to `--onboard` if you provide no other options.

    For example, if you want to deploy a cluster in a Google Cloud account having an ID of `1234-5678-9012`, with an instance type of `M1`, in the `us-east-1` region, in a `public` endpoint, and with no existing cluster deployed, run the following command:

    ```shell
    curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-utilities/main/gcp/biganimal-csp-preflight | bash -s \
    1234-5678-9012 \
    us-east-1 \
    --instance-type m1 \
    --endpoint public \
    --activate-region \
    --onboard\
    ```

The script displays the following output:

-   Whether your Google Cloud account restricts vCPUs, elastic IP addresses, VPCs, or NLBs in your region (and availability zone, if HA is enabled).

VALERIO, IS THERE SIMILAR GCP INFORMATION WE SHOULD SUPPLY?

Open an AWS support request to remove restrictions for the resources with `NotAvailable` displayed in the `Suggestion` column.
