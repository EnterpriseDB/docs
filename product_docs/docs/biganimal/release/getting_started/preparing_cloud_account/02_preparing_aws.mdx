title: "Preparing your AWS account"
---

BigAnimal requires you to configure your AWS account before you deploy your clusters. The configurations that you perform ensure that your AWS account is prepared to meet your clusters' requirements and resource limits, such as:

   - Is the AWS CLI configured to access to your AWS account?
   - Is there a sufficient limit on the number of vCPUs and Network Load Balancers (NLBs) left in your region?

## Check AWS account readiness for running BigAnimal

EDB provides a shell script, called [biganimal-csp-preflight](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-utilities/blob/main/aws/biganimal-csp-preflight), which checks whether requirements and resource limits are met in your AWS account based on the clusters you plan to deploy.

1.  Open the [AWS Cloud Shell](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudshell) in your browser.
2.  From the AWS Cloud Shell, run the following command:  

    ```shell
    curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-utilities/main/aws/biganimal-csp-preflight | bash -s <AWS-account-ID> <region> [options]
    ```
    The required arguments are:

    | Argument | Description |
    | -------- | ----------- |
    | &lt;target-subscription> | AWS account ID of your BigAnimal deployment. |
    | &lt;region> | AWS region where your clusters are being deployed. See [Supported regions](../../overview/03a_region_support) for a list of possible regions. |
    
    Possible options are:

    | Options | Description |
    | ------- | ----------- |
    | `-h` or `--help`| Displays the command help. |
    | `-i` or `--instance-type` | AWS instance type for the BigAnimal cluster. The help command provides a list of possible VM instance types. Choose the instance type that best suits your application and workload. Choose an instance type in the memory optimized R5, R5B, or R6I series for large data sets. Choose from the compute-optimized C5 or C6I series for compute-bound applications. Choose from the general purpose M5 or M6I series if you don't require memory or compute optimization.|
    | `-a` or `--high-availability` | Enables high availability for the cluster. See [Supported architectures](../../overview/02_high_availability) for more information.|
    | `-e` or `--endpoint` | Type of network endpoint for the BigAnimal cluster, either `public` or `private`. See [Cluster networking architecture](../creating_a_cluster/01_cluster_networking) for more information. |
    | `-r` or `--activate-region` | Specifies region activation if no clusters currently exist in the region. |
    | `--onboard` | Checks if the user and subscription are correctly configured. 
    
    The behavior of the script defaults to `--onboard` if you provide no other options.

    For example, if you want to deploy a cluster in an AWS account having an ID of `1234-5678-9012`, with an instance type of `r5.24xlarge`, in the `us-east-1` region, in a `public` endpoint, and with no existing cluster deployed, run the following command:

    ```shell
    curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnterpriseDB/cloud-utilities/main/aws/biganimal-csp-preflight | bash -s \
    1234-5678-9012 \
    us-east-1 \
    --instance-type r5.24xlarge \
    --endpoint public \
    --activate-region \
    --onboard\
    ```

The script displays the following output:

-   Whether your AWS account restricts vCPUs, elastic IP addresses, VPCs, or NLBs in your region (and availability zone, if HA is enabled). Open an AWS support request to remove restrictions for the resources with `NotAvailable` displayed in the `Suggestion` column. See [Request quota increase](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/latest/userguide/request-quota-increase.html). For default service quota limits in AWS, see [AWS service information](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-general.pdf#aws-service-information.)
