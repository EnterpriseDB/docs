Follow these BigAnimal requirements and recommended resource limits in Azure.

## Azure resource provider registrations

BigAnimal creates and manages some of the resources using resource providers. For example, if you want to store keys, you need the Microsoft.KeyVault resource provider. This resource provider offers a resource type called *vaults* for creating the key vault. For more information, see [Azure resource providers and types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types).

To prevent failures while creating your clusters, ensure that each of the following Azure resource providers are registered in your Azure subscription.

| Provider namespace             | Description                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Microsoft.Compute              | Runs cluster workloads on a virtual machine managed by the Azure Kubernetes service                    |
| Microsoft.ContainerInstance    | Manages the Azure resource and regular maintenance job.                                                |
| Microsoft.Capacity             | Checks the Azure resource quota                                                                        |
| Microsoft.AlertsManagement     | Monitors failure anomalies                                                                             |
| Microsoft.ContainerService     | Manages cluster workloads run on the Azure Kubernetes Service                                          |
| Microsoft.KeyVault             | Encrypts and stores keys of the clusters' data volume and Azure's credential information               |
| Microsoft.Storage              | Backs up data to the Azure Service Account                                                             |
| Microsoft.ManagedIdentity      | Manages software access to the local Azure services using Azure Managed-Identity                       |
| Microsoft.Network              | Manages cluster workloads run in the Azure Kubernetes Service in the dedicated VNet                    |
| Microsoft.OperationalInsights  | Manages clusters and performs workload logging (log workspace)                                        |
| Microsoft.OperationsManagement | Monitors workloads and provides container insight                                                      |
| Microsoft.Portal               | Provides a dashboard to monitor the running status of the clusters (using aggregated logs and metrics) |

## Virtual machine SKU restrictions

When you deploy your clusters in high availability (HA) mode, BigAnimal uses multiple availability zones in the region where you plan to deploy the cluster. Ensure that all regions designated for the deployment of your clusters have no virtual machine SKU restrictions for the ESv3 and Dv4 VM size families in zone 1, 2, and 3.

## Public IP addresses limits

Every BigAnimal cluster with public network access is assigned a single public IP address, and this IP address counts against the quota for both basic and standard IP address types in a region. BigAnimal can't create more clusters if the IP address limit is reached.

### Default Azure limit

The default public IP addresses limits for basic and standard type are set to 10. See [Public IP address limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#publicip-address) for more information.

### Recommended limit

EDB recommends that you increase the public IP addresses limits for Basic and Standard type to 50. If you need more than 50 clusters, increase the limit to the number of clusters you plan to deploy.

## vCPU limits

Any time a new VM is deployed in Azure, the vCPUs for the VMs must not exceed the total vCPU limits for the region.

Clusters deployed in the region use ESv3 virtual machine cores. The number of cores depends on the instance type and HA options of the clusters. You can calculate the number of ESv3 cores required for your cluster based on the following:

-   A virtual machine instance of type E{N}sv3 uses {N} cores. For example, an instance of type E64sv3 uses 64 ESv3 cores.
-   A cluster running on an E{N}sv3 instance without HA enabled uses exactly {N} ESv3 cores.
-   A cluster running on an E{N}sv3 instance with HA enabled uses 3 \* {N} ESv3 cores.

For example, if you provision the largest virtual machine E64sv3 with high availability enabled, it requires (3 \* 64) = 192 ESv3 cores per region.

BigAnimal requires an additional eight Dv4 virtual machine cores per region.

### Default limit

The default number of total vCPU (cores) per subscription per region is 20. For more information, see [Virtual Machines limits - Azure Resource Manager](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#virtual-machines-limits---azure-resource-manager).

### Recommended limits

BigAnimal recommends the following per region when requesting virtual machine resource limit increases:

-   Total Regional vCPUs: minimum of 60 per designated region
-   Standard ESv3 Family vCPUs: minimum of 50 per designated region
-   Standard Dv4 Family vCPUs: minimum of 10 per designated region
