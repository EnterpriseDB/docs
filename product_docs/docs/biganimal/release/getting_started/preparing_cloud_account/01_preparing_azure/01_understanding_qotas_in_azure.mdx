Follow these BigAnimal requirements and recommended resource limits in Azure.

## Azure resource provider registrations

BigAnimal creates and manages some of the resources using resource providers. For example, if you want to store keys, you need the Microsoft.KeyVault resource provider. This resource provider offers a resource type called *vaults* for creating the key vault. For more information, see [Azure resource providers and types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/resource-providers-and-types).

To prevent failures while creating your clusters, ensure that each of the following Azure resource providers are registered in your Azure subscription.

| Provider namespace             | Description                                                                                             |

| Microsoft.Compute              | Runs cluster workloads on a virtual machine managed by the Azure Kubernetes service                    |
| Microsoft.ContainerInstance    | Manages the Azure resource and regular maintenance job.                                                |
| Microsoft.Capacity             | Checks the Azure resource quota                                                                        |
| Microsoft.AlertsManagement     | Monitors failure anomalies                                                                             |
| Microsoft.ContainerService     | Manages cluster workloads run on the Azure Kubernetes Service                                          |
| Microsoft.KeyVault             | Encrypts and stores keys of the clusters' data volume and Azure's credential information               |
| Microsoft.Storage              | Backs up data to the Azure Service Account                                                             |
| Microsoft.ManagedIdentity      | Manages software access to the local Azure services using Azure Managed-Identity                       |
| Microsoft.Network              | Manages cluster workloads run in the Azure Kubernetes Service in the dedicated VNet                    |
| Microsoft.OperationalInsights  | Manages clusters and performs workload logging (log workspace)                                        |
| Microsoft.OperationsManagement | Monitors workloads and provides container insight                                                      |
| Microsoft.Portal               | Provides a dashboard to monitor the running status of the clusters (using aggregated logs and metrics) |

## Regional activation resources and access requirements

The table provides BigAnimal's regional activation resources and access requirements.

!!!note
A Storage account for TFstate is created on the first activated region per BigAnimal project. It is in private network access. Private DNS zone are required for private storage account and private key vaults.

## Public IP addresses limits

Every BigAnimal cluster with public network access is assigned a single public IP address, and this IP address counts against the quota for both basic and standard IP address types in a region. BigAnimal can't create more clusters if the IP address limit is reached.

### Recommended limit

The default public IP addresses limits for basic and standard type are set to 10. See [Public IP address limits](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/azure-subscription-service-limits#publicip-address) for more information. If you need more than 10 clusters, increase the limit to the number of clusters you plan to deploy plus current usage.

## vCPU limits

Any time a new VM is deployed in Azure, the vCPUs for the VMs must not exceed the total vCPU limits for the region.

The number of cores required by the database cluster depends on the instance type and cluster type of the clusters. For exampe, if you create cluster with ESv3 instance type, you can calculate the number of ESv3 cores required for your cluster based on the following:

-   A virtual machine instance of type E{N}sv3 uses {N} cores. For example, an instance of type E64sv3 uses 64 ESv3 cores.
-   A cluster running on an E{N}sv3 instance without HA enabled uses exactly {N} ESv3 cores.
-   A cluster running on an E{N}sv3 instance with HA enabled and 2 replicas uses 3 \* {N} ESv3 cores.

BigAnimal requires an additional eight Dv4 virtual machine cores per region for management resources. 

BigAnimal requires an additional six Dv4 virtual machine cores per region for periodic maintenance upgrades.

### Recommended limits

BigAnimal recommends the following per region when requesting virtual machine resource limit increases:

-   Total Regional vCPUs: minimum of 50 per designated region
-   Standard Dv4 Family vCPUs: minimum of 14 per designated region
-   Other Family vCPUs: depending on the instance type, cluster type, and number of clusters.
