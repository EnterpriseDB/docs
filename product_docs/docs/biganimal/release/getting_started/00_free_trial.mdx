title: BigAnimal free trial
---

EDB offers a 14-day free trial for anyone interested in exploring BigAnimal and its capabilities. The BigAnimal free trial functions like the full-featured BigAnimal so you can get a feel for what to expect. 

## How to start your free trial
You can request a BigAnimal free trial from several locations:
- The EDB [Get started](https://www.enterprisedb.com/get-started) sign-up page
- The [BigAnimal home page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/products/biganimal-cloud-postgresql)
- The EDB login page

## What you can do with your free trial
- The free trial lasts for 14 days. The count begins when you provision a cluster. 
- You can provision a single cluster with 2 vCPU and 16 GB RAM in either PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server with up to 4GB of Azure Premium SSD storage. 
- You can choose to provision your cluster in either of 2 Azure Regions: US East 2 or West Europe (Netherlands). 
  - If you delete your cluster within the 14 day trial period, you can restore that cluster or you can provision a new cluster. 
  - Numerous other instance types, storage types, and regions are available with a paid account.
- During the trial, you have access to EDB enterprise-level support.
- You can connect to your database cluster. 
- You can edit the database configuration for a cluster and view the activity log for the service.
- You get an understanding of what account management looks like in BigAnimal.

## What you can’t do
Since this is a free trial, there are a few nuances and limitations to what you can do with a free account:

- You cannot invite team members to join your cluster or assign roles in the free trial. Other team members should create their own free trial account to explore BigAnimal. 
- Backups are only retained for 30 days. 
- The BigAnimal Free Trial interface notes which features are not available in the free trial. No private networking or superuser access is available in the trial. High availability, logging, monitoring, and performance benchmarking are also not available. 

## What happens when the free trial ends 

Within the BigAnimal Free Trial interface, a countdown displays the time remaining for your free trial. 

When the free trial ends, your account continues to exist but your cluster and its backup and data are deleted. You cannot transfer your cluster from the free trial to a paid account. Your free trial account is separate from a paid BigAnimal account.
