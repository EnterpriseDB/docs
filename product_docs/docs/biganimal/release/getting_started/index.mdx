As a cloud administrator, you can set up BigAnimal with your existing Azure subscription or AWS account, invite others to join you in exploring what EDB has to offer, and create initial clusters as an account owner so that development can begin. 

If you purchase BigAnimal directly from EDB Sales, you need to [set up your own identity provider](/biganimal/release/getting_started/identity_provider). If you purchased from Azure Marketplace, you need to [set up your Azure account](/biganimal/release/getting_started/02_azure_market_setup). 

After setting up your organization through your identity provider or Azure Marketplace account, you connect your cloud account to BigAnimal.
