As a cloud administrator, you can:
-  Set up BigAnimal with your existing Azure subscription or AWS account. (You don't need to do this if you're using BigAnimal's cloud account.)
-  Invite others to join you in exploring what EDB has to offer.
-  Create initial clusters as an account owner so that development can begin. 

<!-- Alternatively, you can use [BigAnimal's Terraform provider](../using_cluster/terraform_provider) to incorporate BigAnimal into your existing cloud infrastructure workflows.  -->

BigAnimal's portal can serve as an identity provider for users that have EDB accounts. After signing in for the first time, you can then [set up your own identity provider](/biganimal/release/getting_started/identity_provider/#setting-up-your-own-identity-provider). 

!!! Note
    If you purchased from Azure Marketplace, you need to [set up your Azure account](/biganimal/release/getting_started/02_azure_market_setup) to be your identity provider.
