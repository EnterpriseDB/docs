As a cloud administrator, you can:
-  Set up BigAnimal with your existing Azure subscription or AWS account.
-  Invite others to join you in exploring what EDB has to offer.
-  Create initial clusters as an account owner so that development can begin. 

<!-- Alternatively, you can use [BigAnimal's Terraform provider](../using_cluster/terraform_provider) to incorporate BigAnimal into your existing cloud infrastructure workflows.  -->

If you purchased BigAnimal directly from EDB Sales, you need to [set up your own identity provider](/biganimal/release/getting_started/identity_provider). If you purchased from Azure Marketplace, you need to [set up your Azure account](/biganimal/release/getting_started/02_azure_market_setup). 

After setting up your organization through your identity provider or Azure Marketplace account, you connect your cloud account to BigAnimal.
