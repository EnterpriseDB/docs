## Prerequisites

- To connect BigAnimal to Amazon Web Services Single Sign-On (AWS SSO), your AWS account must have administrator access. 

- A unique URL and access code are provided in an email from cloudcare@enterprisedb.com. Contact [cloudcare@enterprisedb.com](mailto:cloudcare@enterprisedb.com) if you don't receive the email. The URL becomes invalid after you set up your identity provider with BigAnimal. For issues with the code or identity provider setup, contact [Support](/biganimal/release/overview/support).

## Set up BigAnimal with AWS SSO

1. To access the Set Up Identity Provider page in BigAnimal, open the link in the email sent from cloudcare@enterprisedb.com.
1. You will be copying and pasting between BigAnimal and AWS so in a separate browser tab or window log into your AWS account and go to the [**AWS SSO console**](https://console.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon).
1. Choose **Enable AWS SSO** if SSO isn't already enabled on your account. 
   !!! note
   You may need to switch to a region where SSO is enabled. AWS Organizations support SSO in only one region at a time.
   !!!
1. Navigate to the Applications page by either selecting **Applications** from the left navigation pane or selecting the link in step 3 on the Welcome to AWS Single Sign-On page.
