## Prerequisites

To connect BigAnimal to Azure AD, you must either:

-  Have one of the following roles in Azure:

   - Global Administrator
   - Cloud Application Administrator
   - Application Administrator

- Be the owner of the service principal

A unique URL and access code are provided in an email from cloudcare@enterprisedb.com. Contact [cloudcare@enterprisedb.com](mailto:cloudcare@enterprisedb.com) if you don't receive the email. The URL becomes invalid after you set up your identity provider with BigAnimal. For issues with the code or identity provider setup, contact [Support](/biganimal/release/overview/support).

## Set up BigAnimal with Azure AD

1. To access the Set Up Identity Provider page in BigAnimal, open the link in the email sent from cloudcare@enterprisedb.com.
1. In a separate browser tab or window, log into the [Azure Active Directory Admin Center](https://aad.portal.azure.com/). 
1. From the left navigation pane, select **Enterprise Applications**. On the Enterprise Applications page: 
   1. Select **New application > Create your own application**.

   1. Enter a name for your application.
   1. Select the third choice for what you intend to do with your application: **Integrate any other application you donâ€™t find in the gallery (Non-gallery)**.
1. After the application is created, from the left navigation menu, select **Single sign-on**. On the Single sign-on page: 
   1. Select **SAML** as your single sign-on method.
   1. Update the Basic SAML Configuration by copying and pasting the following information from the Set Up Identity Provider page in BigAnimal to the SAML Configuration menu in Azure AD:

      | Copy from BigAnimal            | Paste in SAML Configuration |
      | ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
      | Audience URI                   | Identifier (Entity ID)      |
      | Assertion Consumer Service URL | Reply URL                   |
   
   1. Enter the configuration for Attributes & Claims. We recommend the following:

      | Claim name                       | Value                                               | Note             |
      |----------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------|
      | Unique User Identifier (Name ID) | user.userprincipalname [nameid-format:emailAddress] | Required claim   |
      | &lt;assertion_path>/emailaddress | user.mail                                           | Additional claim |
      | &lt;assertion_path>/givenname    | user.givenname                                      | Additional claim |
      | &lt;assertion_path>/name         | user.displayname                                    | Additional claim |
      | &lt;assertion_path>/surname      | user.surname                                        | Additional claim |
   
      Where &lt;assertion_path> is http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/ws/2005/05/identity/claims.

   1. Under **SAML Signing Certificate**, select **Download** for the Base64-encoded certificate.
   1. Copy the **Login URL** value.
1. From the left navigation pane, Select **Properties**. On the Properties page, if you don't want all of the users in Azure AD to use BigAnimal, answer `No` for the **Assignment required?** question. Otherwise, answer `Yes` and assign the specified users to this Enterprise Application explicitly on the Users and Groups page.
1. On the **Setup Config** tab on the Set Up Identity Provider page in BigAnimal: 
   1. Paste the Login URL value you copied from the Single sign-on page in Azure AD as the **Single Sign-On URL**.
