title: Deployment options

You have two deployment options with BigAnimal. You can use your own cloud service provider account to deploy BigAnimal or you can use BigAnimal's cloud account.

Using BigAnimal's cloud account or a separate cloud account incurs different costs. For more information, see [Pricing and billing](../pricing_and_billing).

## Using your own cloud account

You can use your AWS or Azure account to deploy BigAnimal. In this deployment model, you are responsible for your managing your cloud resources and connecting your cloud to BigAnimal. 

## Using BigAnimal's cloud account

BigAnimal's cloud account offers a seamless deployment option if you don't want to set up a separate cloud account for your clusters. 

!!! Note Note
Currently, BigAnimal's cloud account is offered only with AWS as your cloud provider.
