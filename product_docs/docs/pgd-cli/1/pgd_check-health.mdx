Checks the health of the BDR cluster

### Synopsis


Performs various checks like all nodes are accessible, all replication slots
are working, CAMO pairs are connected etc.

```
pgd check-health [flags]
```

### Examples

```

  Example 1 (3 node cluster, bdr-a1 and bdr-c1 are up, bdr-b1 is down; bdr-a1 and bdr-b1 are CAMO partners)

  $ pgd check-health

  Check      Status   Message
  -----      ------   -------
  CAMO       Critical At least 1 CAMO partner is not connected
  ClockSkew  Critical Clockskew cannot be determined for at least 1 BDR node pair
  Connection Critical The node bdr-b1 is not accessible
  Raft       Warning  There is no RAFT_LEADER, an election might be in progress
  Replslots  Critical There is at least 1 BDR replication slot which is inactive
  Version    Warning  There is at least 1 node that is not accessible


  Example 2 (3 node cluster, all nodes are up but system clocks are not in sync)

  $ pgd check-health

  Check      Status  Message
  -----      ------  -------
  CAMO       Ok      All CAMO pairs are connected
  ClockSkew  Warning At least 1 BDR node pair has clockskew greater than 2 seconds
  Connection Ok      All BDR nodes are accessible
  Raft       Ok      Raft Consensus is working correctly
  Replslots  Ok      All BDR replication slots are working correctly
  Version    Ok      All nodes are running same BDR versions


  Example 3 (3 node cluster, all nodes are up and all checks are Ok)

  $ pgd check-health

  Check      Status Message
  -----      ------ -------
  CAMO       Ok     All CAMO pairs are connected
  ClockSkew  Ok     All BDR node pairs have clockskew within permissible limit
  Connection Ok     All BDR nodes are accessible
  Raft       Ok     Raft Consensus is working correctly
  Replslots  Ok     All BDR replication slots are working correctly
  Version    Ok     All nodes are running same BDR versions

```
