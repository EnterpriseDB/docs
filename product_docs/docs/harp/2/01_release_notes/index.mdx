High Availability Routing for Postgres (HARP) is a cluster-management tool for
[Bi-directional Replication (BDR)](/bdr/latest) clusters. The core design of
the tool is to route all application traffic in a single data center or
region to only one node at a time. This node, designated the lead master, acts
as the principle write target to reduce the potential for data conflicts.
