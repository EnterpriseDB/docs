title: "Version 2.1.0"
---

This is a minor release of HARP 2 that includes new features as well
as fixes for issues identified in previous versions.

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Feature | Support for selecting a leader per location rather than relying on DCS like etcd to have separate setup in different locations. This still requires a majority of nodes to survive loss of a location, so an odd number of both locations and database nodes is recommended.|
| Feature | The BDR DCS now uses a push notification from the consensus rather than through polling nodes. This change reduces the time for new leader selection and the load that HARP does on the BDR DCS since it doesn't need to poll in short intervals anymore. |
| Feature | TPA now restarts each HARP Proxy one by one and wait until they come back to reduce any downtime incurred by the application during software upgrades. |
| Feature | The support for embedding PGBouncer directly into HARP Proxy is now deprecated and will be removed in the next major release of HARP. It's now possible to configure TPA to put PGBouncer on the same node as HARP Proxy and point to that HARP Proxy.|
| Bug Fix | `harpctl promote <node_name>` would occasionally promote a different node than the one specified.  This has been fixed. [Support Ticket #75406] |
| Bug Fix | Fencing would sometimes fail when using BDR as the Distributed Consensus Service.  This has been corrected. |
| Bug Fix | `harpctl apply` no longer turns off routing for leader after the cluster has been established. [Support Ticket #80790] |
| Bug Fix | Harp-manager no longer exits if it cannot start a failed database. Harp-manager will keep retrying with randomly increasing periods. [Support Ticket #78516] |
| Bug Fix | The internal pgbouncer proxy implementation had a memory leak.  This has been remediated. |
