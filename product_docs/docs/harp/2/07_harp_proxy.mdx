title: HARP Proxy
---

HARP Proxy is a daemon which acts as an abstraction layer between the client 
application and Postgres. It interfaces with the Consensus Layer to obtain the 
identity of the current Lead Master node and directs traffic to that location. 
In the event of a planned switchover or unplanned failover, it will 
automatically redirect to the new Lead Master node as dictated by the DCS.

You may select between pgbouncer or builtin for HARP Proxy.  If you do not specify 
which proxy type; the default is `builtin`. When using pgbouncer, HARP Proxy is 
an interface layer between the DCS and PgBouncer. As such, PgBouncer is a 
prerequisite and should be installed in addition, in order for HARP Proxy to 
fully manage its activity.

The builtin proxy does not require any additional software.  When using builtin, 
HARP Proxy functions as a level 4 pass-through proxy.

## Builtin Proxy
### How it Works

Upon starting, HARP Proxy will listen for incoming connections on the listening 
address and listening port specified in the bootstrap file per proxy instance.  
All application client traffic will then pass through Builtin Proxy into the 
current Lead Master node for the Location where this proxy is operating.

In the event the Lead Master lease is not set, HARP Proxy will disconnect all 
connection traffic until a new Lead Master is established. This also applies
to circumstances when `harpctl promote` is used to invoke a planned transition
to a new Lead Master. The disconnect is immediate.

### Configuration

The built-in proxy is chosen by setting the proxy type to `builtin`.  The only 
other option applicable to the built-in proxy is `max_client_conn` which 
specifies the maximum allowed client connections.  If `max_client_conn` is
higher than what the system can handle-- it will be lowered to a setting
that is within the capability of the system that the proxy is on.

## PgBouncer
### How it Works

!!! Note
    If greater configurability of pgbouncer than what harp proxy provides is needed,
    the recommended setup is to use built-in proxy and have pgbouncer point to it.

Upon starting, HARP Proxy will launch PgBouncer if it is not already running, 
and leave client connections in a paused state. Afterwards, it will contact the 
DCS to determine the identity of the Lead Master, configure PgBouncer to use 
this as the target for database connections, and resume connection activity. 
All application client traffic will then pass through PgBouncer into the 
current Lead Master node for the Location where this proxy is operating.

While PgBouncer is running, HARP Proxy will check its status based on the 
`monitor_interval` configuration setting within the DCS, and store it in the
DCS for monitoring purposes. This will allow interrogation with `harpctl` to
retrieve status of all configured proxies, or any one proxy in particular.

In the event the Lead Master lease is not set, HARP Proxy will pause all 
connection traffic until a new Lead Master is established. This also applies
to circumstances when `harpctl promote` is used to invoke a planned transition
to a new Lead Master. It uses a PgBouncer `PAUSE` command for this, so existing
sessions are allowed to complete any pending transactions before they are held
in stasis.

### PgBouncer Configuration File

When HARP Proxy utilizes PgBouncer for connection management and redirection, 
a `pgbouncer.ini` file must exist. HARP Manager builds this file based on various
run-time directives as defined in the [Proxy Directives](04_configuration) documentation.

This file will be located in the same folder as the `config.yml` used by HARP
Proxy. Any PgBouncer process launched by HARP Proxy will use this configuration
file, and it may be used for debugging or information purposes. Modifications 
to this automatically generated `pgbouncer.ini` file will be lost any time
HARP Proxy is restarted, so use `harpctl set proxy` to alter these settings
instead. Calling `harpctl set proxy` does not update the `pgbouncer.ini` file until the proxy has been restarted.

### Disabling and Re-enabling HARP Proxy Node Management

It is possible to temporarily pause HARP Proxy control of PgBouncer. This 
results in a state where the daemon continues running but does not perform any 
operations that could affect existing behavior of the cluster. Re-enabling 
management causes it to resume operation.

An example of temporarily disabling management of a specific proxy would be:

```bash
harpctl unmanage proxy proxy1
```

See the [harpctl](08_harpctl) documentation for more details.

Proxy node management is enabled by default.

### Passthrough User Authentication

With pgbouncer we strongly recommend configuring HARP Proxy to use the `auth_user` and 
`auth_query` run-time directives. If these are not set, the PgBouncer 
`userlist.txt` file must include username and password hash combinations for 
every user PgBouncer needs to authenticate on Postgres' behalf.

This should *not* be the `pgbouncer` user itself, as this is utilized by HARP 
Proxy as an admin-level user in order to operate the underlying PgBouncer 
service.

In clusters administered by TPAexec, a function will be created and installed 
in the `pg_catalog` schema in the `template1` database during provisioning. 
This means any subsequently created databases will also include the function, 
and it will be available to PgBouncer regardless of which database the user is 
attempting to contact.

If TPAexec is not used, we still recommend this function definition:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pg_catalog.pgbouncer_get_auth(p_usename TEXT)
RETURNS TABLE(username TEXT, password TEXT) AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY
  SELECT usename::TEXT, passwd::TEXT FROM pg_catalog.pg_shadow
   WHERE usename = p_usename;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER

REVOKE ALL ON FUNCTION pg_catalog.pgbouncer_get_auth(p_usename TEXT)
  FROM PUBLIC

GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_catalog.pgbouncer_get_auth(p_usename TEXT)
   TO <auth_user>;
```

Don't forget to substitute `<auth_user>` for the `auth_user` field supplied to 
HARP Proxy.

Then in the Bootstrap file, the following will complete the configuration:

```yaml
cluster: 
  name: mycluster

proxies:
  monitor_interval: 5
  default_pool_size: 20
  max_client_conn: 1000
  auth_user: pgb_auth
  type: pgbouncer
  auth_query: "SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pgbouncer_get_auth($1)"
  database_name: bdrdb
  instances:
    - name: proxy1
    - name: proxy2
```

It is also possible to define these fields with `harpctl set proxy`:

```bash
harpctl set proxy global auth_user=pgb_auth
```

!!! Note
    This means the `postgres` or `enterprisedb` OS user that launches HARP
    Proxy will need a `.pgpass` file so that `auth_user` can authenticate 
    against Postgres.

### Configuration

HARP Proxy expects the `dcs`, `cluster`, and `proxy` configuration stanzas. The 
following is a functional example:

```yaml
cluster:
  name: mycluster

dcs:
  driver: etcd
  endpoints:
    - host1:2379
    - host2:2379
    - host3:2379

proxy:
  name: proxy1
```
Each proxy will connect to the DCS to retrieve what hosts and ports to listen on for connections.

### Usage

This is the basic usage for HARP Proxy:

```bash
Usage of ./harp-proxy:
  -f string
    	Optional path to config file (shorthand)
  --config string
    	Optional path to config file
```

Note that there are no arguments to launch `harp-proxy` as a forked daemon. 
This software is designed to be launched through systemd or within a container 
as a top-level process. This also means output is directed to STDOUT and STDERR
for capture and access through journald or an attached container terminal.
