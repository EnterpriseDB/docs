HARP is a new approach to high availability for BDR
clusters. It leverages a consensus-driven quorum to determine the correct connection endpoint
in a semi-exclusive manner to prevent unintended multi-node writes from an
application.

## The importance of quorum

The central purpose of HARP is to enforce full quorum on any Postgres cluster
it manages. Quorum is a term applied to a voting body that
mandates a certain minimum of attendees are available to make a decision. More simply: majority rules.

For any vote to end in a result other than a tie, an odd number of
nodes must constitute the full cluster membership. Quorum, however, doesn't
strictly demand this restriction; a simple majority is enough. This means
that in a cluster of N nodes, quorum requires a minimum of N/2+1 nodes to hold
a meaningful vote.

All of this ensures the cluster is always in agreement regarding the node
that is "in charge." For a BDR cluster consisting of multiple nodes, this
determines the node that is the primary write target. HARP designates this node
as the lead master.

## Reducing write targets

The consequence of ignoring the concept of quorum, or not applying it
well enough, can lead to a "split brain" scenario where the "correct" write
target is ambiguous or unknowable. In a standard Postgres cluster, it's
important that only a single node is ever writable and sending replication
traffic to the remaining nodes.

Even in multi-master-capable approaches such as BDR, it can be help to
reduce the amount of necessary conflict management to derive identical data
across the cluster. In clusters that consist of multiple BDR nodes per physical
location or region, this usually means a single BDR node acts as a "leader" and
remaining nodes are "shadow." These shadow nodes are still writable, but writing to them is discouraged unless absolutely necessary.

By leveraging quorum, it's possible for all nodes to agree on the exact
Postgres node to represent the entire cluster or a local BDR region. Any
nodes that lose contact with the remainder of the quorum, or are overruled by
it, by definition can't become the cluster leader.

This restriction prevents split-brain situations where writes unintentionally reach two
Postgres nodes. Unlike technologies such as VPNs, proxies, load balancers, or
DNS, you can't circumvent a quorum-derived consensus by misconfiguration or
network partitions. So long as it's possible to contact the consensus layer to
determine the state of the quorum maintained by HARP, only one target is ever
valid.

## Basic architecture

The design of HARP comes in essentially two parts, consisting of a manager and
a proxy. The following diagram describes how these interact with a single
Postgres instance:

![HARP Unit](images/ha-unit.png)

The consensus layer is an external entity where Harp Manager maintains 
information it learns about its assigned Postgres node, and HARP Proxy 
translates this information to a valid Postgres node target. Because Proxy
obtains the node target from the consensus layer, several such instances can
exist independently.

While using BDR as the consensus layer, each server node resembles this
variant instead:

![HARP Unit w/BDR Consensus](images/ha-unit-bdr.png)

In either case, each unit consists of the following elements:

* A Postgres or EDB instance
* A consensus layer resource, meant to track various attributes of the Postgres
  instance
* A HARP Manager process to convey the state of the Postgres node to the
  consensus layer
* A HARP Proxy service that directs traffic to the proper lead master node,
  as derived from the consensus layer

Not every application stack has access to additional node resources 
specifically for the Proxy component, so it can be combined with the 
application server to simplify the stack.

This is a typical design using two BDR nodes in a single data center organized in a lead master/shadow master configuration:

![HARP Cluster](images/ha-ao.png)

When using BDR  as the HARP consensus layer, at least three
fully qualified BDR nodes must be present to ensure a quorum majority. (Not shown in the diagram are connections between BDR nodes.)

## How it works

When managing a BDR cluster, HARP maintains at most one leader node per
defined location. This is referred to as the lead master. Other BDR
nodes that are eligible to take this position are shadow master state until they take the leader role.

Applications can contact the current leader only through the proxy service. 
Since the consensus layer requires quorum agreement before conveying leader 
state, proxy services direct traffic to that node.

At a high level, this mechanism prevents simultaneous application interaction with
multiple nodes.

### Determining a leader

As an example, consider the role of lead master in a locally subdivided
BDR Always-On group as can exist in a single data center. When any
Postgres or Manager resource is started, and after a configurable refresh
interval, the following must occur:

1. The Manager checks the status of its assigned Postgres resource.
    - If Postgres isn't running, try again after configurable timeout.
    - If Postgres is running, continue.
2. The Manager checks the status of the leader lease in the consensus layer.
    - If the lease is unclaimed, acquire it and assign the identity of
      the Postgres instance assigned to this manager. This lease duration is
      configurable, but setting it too low can result in unexpected leadership
      transitions.
    - If the lease is already claimed by us, renew the lease TTL.
    - Otherwise do nothing.

A lot more occurs, but this simplified version explains
what's happening. The leader lease can be held by only one node, and if it's
held elsewhere, HARP Manager gives up and tries again later.

!!! Note
    Depending on the chosen consensus layer, rather than repeatedly looping to
    check the status of the leader lease, HARP subscribes to notifications. In this case, it can respond immediately any time the state of the
    lease changes rather than polling. Currently this functionality is
    restricted to the etcd consensus layer.

This means HARP itself doesn't hold elections or manage quorum, which is
delegated to the consensus layer. A quorum of the consensus layer must acknowledge the act of obtaining the lease, so if the request succeeds,
that node leads the cluster in that location.

### Connection routing

Once the role of the lead master is established, connections are handled
with a similar deterministic result as reflected by HARP Proxy. Consider a case
where HARP Proxy needs to determine the connection target for a particular backend
resource:

1. HARP Proxy interrogates the consensus layer for the current lead master in
   its configured location.
2. If this is unset or in transition:
    - New client connections to Postgres are barred, but clients
      accumulate and are in a paused state until a lead master appears.
    - Existing client connections are allowed to complete current transactions
      and are then reverted to a similar pending state as new connections.
3. Client connections are forwarded to the lead master.

The interplay shown in this case doesn't require any
interaction with either HARP Manager or Postgres. The consensus layer
is the source of all truth from the proxy's perspective.

### Colocation

The arrangement of the work units is such that their organization must follow these principles:

1. The manager and Postgres units must exist concomitantly in the same
   node.
2. The contents of the consensus layer dictate the prescriptive role of all
   operational work units.

This arrangement delegates cluster quorum responsibilities to the consensus layer, 
while HARP leverages it for critical role assignments and key/value storage. 
Neither storage nor retrieval succeeds if the consensus layer is inoperable 
or unreachable, thus preventing rogue Postgres nodes from accepting 
connections.

As a result, the consensus layer generally exists outside of HARP or HARP-managed nodes for maximum safety. Our reference diagrams show this separation, although it isn't required.

!!! Note
    To operate and manage cluster state, BDR contains its own
    implementation of the Raft Consensus model. You can configure HARP to
    leverage this same layer to reduce reliance on external dependencies and
    to preserve server resources. However, certain drawbacks to this
    approach are discussed in
    [Consensus layer](09_consensus-layer).

## Recommended architecture and use

HARP was primarily designed to represent a BDR Always-On architecture that
resides in two or more data centers and consists of at least five BDR
nodes. This configuration doesn't count any logical standby nodes.

The following diagram shows the current and standard representation:

![BDR Always-On Reference Architecture](images/bdr-ao-spec.png)

In this diagram, HARP Manager exists on BDR Nodes 1-4. The initial state 
of the cluster is that BDR Node 1 is the lead master of DC A, and BDR 
Node 3 is the lead master of DC B.

This configuration results in any HARP Proxy resource in DC A connecting to BDR Node 1 
and the HARP Proxy resource in DC B connecting to BDR Node 3.

!!! Note
    While this diagram shows only a single HARP Proxy per DC, this is
    an example only and should not be considered a single point of failure. Any
    number of HARP Proxy nodes can exist, and they all direct application
    traffic to the same node.

### Location configuration

For multiple BDR nodes to be eligible to take the lead master lock in
a location, you must define a location in the `config.yml` configuration
file.

To reproduce the BDR Always-On reference architecture shown in the diagram, include these lines in the `config.yml`
configuration for BDR Nodes 1 and 2:

```yaml
location: dca
```

For BDR Nodes 3 and 4, add:

```yaml
location: dcb
```

This applies to any HARP Proxy nodes that are designated in those respective
data centers as well.

### BDR 3.7 compatibility

BDR 3.7 and later offers more direct location definition by assigning a
location to the BDR node. This is done by calling the following SQL
API function while connected to the BDR node. So for BDR Nodes 1 and 2, you
might do this:

```sql
SELECT bdr.set_node_location('dca');
```

And for BDR Nodes 3 and 4:

```sql
SELECT bdr.set_node_location('dcb');
```
