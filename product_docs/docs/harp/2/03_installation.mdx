A standard installation of HARP includes two system services:

* HARP Manager (`harp-manager`) on the node being managed
* HARP Proxy (`harp-proxy`) elsewhere

There are generally two ways to install and configure these services to manage
Postgres for proper Quorum-based connection routing.

## Software Versions

HARP does have dependencies on external software. These must fit a minimum
version as listed here.

| Software  | Min Ver |
|-----------|---------|
| etcd      | 3.4     |
| PgBouncer | 1.14    |

## TPAExec

The easiest way to install and configure HARP is to use EDB's TPAexec utility
for cluster deployment and management. For details on this software, see the
[TPAexec product page](https://access.2ndquadrant.com/customer_portal/sw/tpa/).

!!! Note
    TPAExec is currently only available through an EULA specifically dedicated
    to BDR cluster deployments. If you are unable to access the above URL,
    please contact your sales or account representative for more information.

TPAexec itself must be configured to recognize that cluster routing should be
managed through HARP by ensuring the TPA `config.yml` file contains these
attributes:

```yaml
cluster_vars:
  failover_manager: harp
```

!!! Note
    Versions of TPAexec prior to 21.1 require a slightly different approach:

    ```yaml
    cluster_vars:
      enable_harp: true
    ```

After this, HARP will be installed by invoking the regular `tpaexec` commands
for making cluster modifications:

```bash
tpaexec provision ${CLUSTER_DIR}
tpaexec deploy ${CLUSTER_DIR}
```

No other modifications should be necessary, barring cluster-specific
considerations.


## Package Installation

Currently CentOS/RHEL packages are provided via the EDB packaging
infrastructure. For details, see the [HARP product
page](https://access.2ndquadrant.com/customer_portal/sw/harp/).

### etcd Packages

Currently `etcd` packages for many popular Linux distributions are not 
available via their standard public repositories. EDB has therefore packaged 
`etcd` for RHEL and CentOS versions 7 and 8, Debian, and variants such as 
Ubuntu LTS. Again, access to our HARP package repository is necessary to use
these libraries.

## Consensus layer

HARP requires a distributed consensus layer to operate. Currently this must be
either `bdr` or `etcd`. If using fewer than 3 BDR nodes, it may become
necessary to rely on `etcd`. Otherwise any BDR service outage will reduce the
consensus layer to a single node and thus prevent node consensus and disable
Postgres routing.

### etcd

If using `etcd` as the consensus layer, `etcd` must be installed either
directly on the Postgres nodes, or in some separate location they can access.

To set `etcd` as the consensus layer, include this in the HARP `config.yml`
configuration file:

```yaml
dcs:
  driver: etcd
  endpoints:
    - host1:2379
    - host2:2379
    - host3:2379
```

When using TPAExec, all configured etcd endpoints will be entered here 
automatically.

### BDR

The `bdr` native consensus layer is available from BDR 3.6.21 and 3.7.3. This 
Consensus Layer model requires no supplementary software when managing routing 
for a BDR cluster.

As previously mentioned, to ensure Quorum is possible in the cluster, always
use more than two nodes so BDR's consensus layer remains responsive during node
maintenance or outages.

To set BDR as the consensus layer, include this in the `config.yml` 
configuration file:

```yaml
dcs:
  driver: bdr
  endpoints:
    - host=host1 dbname=bdrdb user=harp_user
    - host=host2 dbname=bdrdb user=harp_user
    - host=host3 dbname=bdrdb user=harp_user
```

As can be seen here, the endpoints for a BDR consensus layer follow the
standard Postgres DSN connection format.
