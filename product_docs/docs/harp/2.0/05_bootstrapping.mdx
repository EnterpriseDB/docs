navTitle: Bootstrapping
title: Cluster Bootstrapping
---

In order to use HARP, a minimum amount of metadata must exist in the DCS. The 
process of "bootstrapping" a cluster essentially means initializing node, 
location, and other run-time configuration either all at once, or on a 
per-resource basis.

This entire process is governed through the `harpctl apply` command. For more
information on this, please check the [harpctl docs](08_harpctl).

This section assumes the DCS is set up and functional.

!!! Important
    While examples in this document imply bootstrapping must be done section
    by section, this is not the case. It is possible to combine any or all of
    these into a single YAML document and apply it all at once. We simply split
    up these sections for illustrative purposes and to simplify.

## Cluster-Wide Bootstrapping

Some settings are applied cluster-wide, and can be specified during 
bootstrapping. Currently this only applies to the `event_sync_interval` 
run-time directive, but others may be added later.

The format for this is as follows:

```yaml
cluster: 
  name: mycluster
  event_sync_interval: 100
```

Assuming that file was named `cluster.yml`, you would then apply it with the
following:

```bash
harpctl apply cluster.yml
```

If the cluster name is not already defined within the DCS, this will also
initialize that value.

!!! Important
    The Cluster name parameter specified here will always override the cluster
    name supplied in `config.yml`. The assumption is that the bootstrap file
    supplies all necessary elements to bootstrap a cluster or some portion of
    its larger configuration. A `config.yml` file is primarily meant to control
    the execution of HARP Manager, HARP Proxy, or `harpctl` specifically.

## Location Bootstrapping

Every HARP node is associated with at most one Location. This Location may be
a single Data Center, a grouped Region consisting of multiple underlying
servers, an Amazon Availability Zone, and so on. This is merely a logical
structure that allows HARP to group nodes together such that only one will
represent the nodes in that Location as the Lead Master.

Thus it is necessary to initialize one or more locations. The format for this
is as follows:

```yaml
cluster: 
  name: mycluster

locations:
  - location: dc1
  - location: dc2
```

Assuming that file was named `locations.yml`, you would then apply it with the
following:

```bash
harpctl apply locations.yml
```

Note that when performing any manipulation of the cluster, the name should be
included as a preamble so the changes get directed to the right place.

Once Locations are bootstrapped, they should show up with a quick examination:

```bash
> harpctl get locations

Cluster   Location Leader Previous Leader Target Leader Lease Renewals 
-------   -------- ------ --------------- ------------- -------------- 
mycluster dc1                                           <nil>          
mycluster dc2                                           <nil>          
```

As can be seen here, both locations are recognized by HARP and available for
node and Proxy assignment.

## Node Bootstrapping

HARP Nodes exist within a named cluster, and must have a designated name. 
Beyond this, all other settings are retained within the DCS itself, as they are 
dynamic and may affect how HARP interacts with them. To this end, each node
should be bootstrapped using one or more of the run-time directives discussed
in the [Configuration](04_configuration) documentation.

While bootstrapping a node, there are a few required fields:

* `name`
* `location`
* `dsn`
* `pg_data_dir`

Everything else is optional and may depend on the cluster itself. Because it
is possible to bootstrap multiple nodes at once, the format generally fits
this structure:

```yaml
cluster: 
  name: mycluster

nodes:
  - name: node1
    location: dc1
    dsn: host=node1 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres 
    pg_data_dir: /db/pgdata
    leader_lease_duration: 10
    priority: 500
```

Assuming that file was named `node1.yml`, you would then apply it with the
following:

```bash
harpctl apply node1.yml
```

Once Nodes are bootstrapped, they should show up with a quick examination:

```bash
> harpctl get nodes

Cluster   Name  Ready Role Type Location Fenced Lease Duration 
-------   ----  ----- ---- ---- -------- ------ -------------- 
mycluster node1 true            dc1      false  30            
```

## Proxy Bootstrapping

Unlike Locations or Nodes, Proxies can also supply a configuration template 
that is applied to all proxies within a Location. These are stored in the DCS 
under the `global` designation. Each proxy also requires a name to exist as
an instance, but no further customization is necessary unless some setting
needs a specific override.

This is because there are likely to be multiple proxies that have the same
default configuration settings for the cluster, and repeating these values for
every single proxy shouldn't be necessary.

Additionally, when bootstrapping the Proxy template, at least one database 
should be defined for connection assignments. With these notes in mind, the 
format for this is as follows:

```yaml
cluster: 
  name: mycluster

proxies:
  monitor_interval: 5
  default_pool_size: 20
  max_client_connections: 1000
  database_name: bdrdb
  instances:
    - name: proxy1
    - name: proxy2
      default_pool_size: 50
```

This would configure HARP for two proxies: `proxy1` and `proxy2`, which only 
`proxy2` would have a custom `default_pool_size`, while using the global 
settings otherwise.

Assuming that file was named `proxy.yml`, you would then apply it with the
following:

```bash
harpctl apply proxy.yml
```

Once the Proxy template is bootstrapped, it should show up with a quick 
examination:

```bash
> harpctl get proxies

Cluster   Name   Pool Mode Auth Type Max Client Conn Default Pool Size 
-------   ----   --------- --------- --------------- ----------------- 
mycluster global session   md5       1000            20                
mycluster proxy1 session   md5       1000            20                
mycluster proxy2 session   md5       1000            50                
```
