Beyond basic package installation and configuration, HARP itself does require
Postgres permissions to operate. These allow it to gather information about
Postgres or BDR as necessary to maintain node status within the Consensus
Layer.

## Postgres Permissions

The role specified in the `node.dsn` parameter must have been created one
of the following ways:

* `CREATE USER ...`
* `CREATE ROLE ... WITH LOGIN`

This ensures the role is capable of logging into the database in order to
gather diagnostic information.

Similarly, an entry must exist in `pg_hba.conf` for this role. This can be done
many ways. As an example, consider a VPN subnet where all database hosts are
located somewhere in `10.10.*`. In such a case, the easiest approach is to add
a specific line:

```
# TYPE     DATABASE    USER         ADDRESS         METHOD
hostssl    all         harp_user    10.10.1.1/16    scram-sha-256
```

!!! Note
    In this case we've used the more modern `scram-sha-256` authentication
    rather than `md5` which is now deprecated. We've also elected to require
    SSL authentication by specifying `hostssl`.

## BDR Permissions

BDR nodes have metadata and views that are only visible when certain roles are
granted to the HARP-enabled user. In this case, the HARP user requires the
following:

```sql
GRANT bdr_monitor TO harp_user;
```

The `bdr_monitor` BDR role is meant for status monitoring tools to maintain
ongoing information on cluster operation, thus is perfectly suited to HARP.

## BDR Consensus Permissions

When the `dcs.driver` configuration parameter is set to `bdr`, HARP will 
utilize BDR itself as the Consensus Layer. As such, it requires access to API 
methods that are currently only available to the `bdr_superuser` role. This 
means the HARP-enabled user requires the following:

```sql
GRANT bdr_superuser TO foobar;
```

Currently access to the BDR consensus model does require superuser equivalent
permission.

!!! Important
    BDR Superusers *are not* Postgres superusers. The `bdr_superuser` role is
    merely granted elevated privileges within BDR itself, such as access to
    restricted functions, tables, views, and other objects.
