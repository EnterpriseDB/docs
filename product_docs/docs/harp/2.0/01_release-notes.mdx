## Release 2.0.3 (2022-3-31)
### Enhancements

* **HARP Proxy supports read-only user-dedicated TLS certificate**
You can specify a TLS certificate and key in the HARP Proxy DSN for the DCS read-only user. (78516, HNG-522)

### Bug fixes

*  HARP Proxy continues to try and connect to DCS instead of exiting after 50 seconds. (75406, HNG-548, HNG-560, HNG-561)

## Release 2.0.2 (2022-2-24)
### Enhancements

* **Connection throttling for builtin proxy**
You can now specify the maximum number of connections used by `builtin` proxy.  The proxy will adjust downward the number of connections to fit within your calculated system resource limits.  (75406, 79250, HNG-489, HNG-498, HNG-503, HNG-508)

* **CAMO disabled for BDR DCS**
HARP disables CAMO for its connection to the database to avoid performance degradation when using BDR for the Distributed Consensus System (DCS). (HNG-438)

* **Improved security for HARP Proxy**
You can specify a user with read-only DCS permissions for the `builtin` proxy. (75406, HNG-452)

* **Start, stop, status hooks for managing Postgres** 
You can provide start, stop, and status commands in the HARP Manager configuration for starting postgres, stopping postgres, and retrieving the status of postgres.  If you don't provide commands then systemd is used by default. (HNG-492)

* **PgBouncer was removed as a dependency for HARP Proxy rpm and deb packages.**
PgBouncer isn't installed unless you select `pgbouncer` for `harp_proxy_mode`. (HNG-511)

* **HARP Manager has improved performance communicating with BDR DCS**
HARP Manager communicates with BDR DCS using only a local Unix domain socket. (78516,HNG-494) 

* **Builtin proxy is now the default proxy**
If `pgbouncer` was used by default in a previous release, `harp_proxy_mode` must now be specified as `pgbouncer` to continue as the proxy on upgrade. (HNG-511)
  
* **Binaries now match service names**
The `harp_manager` binary is now named `harp-manager`. The `harp_proxy` binary is now named `harp-proxy`. Symlinks with the previous names are provided. (HNG-514)

* **Improved Harp Manager defaults**
Lag configuration defaults are now set to off by default. Duration of leader lease now has a default setting of 6 seconds. Leader lease renewal setting now defaults to 2 seconds.  (HNG-520)  

### Bug fixes

* HARP Manager now stops the database on exit. (HNG-497)
* HARP Proxy no longer leaks connections when using the `builtin` proxy. (75406,HNG-445)
* HARP Proxy no longer erroneously reports “splice: connection reset by peer” when connections are closed for `builtin` proxy. (75406, HNG-445,)
* Harpctl now returns when querying for `builtin` or `pgbouncer` proxy status. (HNG-499)
* `harpctl get cluster` output no longer contains leader and previous leader fields.
 (HNG-483)
* Harpctl now validates proxy name when executing proxy-related commands. (HNG-471)
* Harpctl now reports correct routing status for leader. (HNG-441)
* HARP configuration files now contain the correct configuration parameters for the corresponding proxy: `builtin` or `pgbouncer`. (78516, HNG-456)
* TPAExec no longer creates a confusing DSN for DCS endpoint with a duplicate user. (78516, HNG-495)
* The `request_timeout` configuration parameter doesn't need a unit specified; units are in milliseconds. (78363, HNG-504)
* The `listen_port` and `listen_host` settings can now be configured per proxy instance using TPAExec. (78848, HNG-456)
* Subscriber-only nodes, which can't become leader nodes, are no longer considered for leadership. (78516, HNG-411)

### Known issues

* When a previously isolated shadow node returns back as an active cluster node, this triggers a raft election and leadership change.
* Promoting a node might cause a different node to be promoted. A race for leadership occurs between the eligible nodes. The first eligible node becomes leader. Use the `--force` option with the `promote` command to have the desired node become leader. 
* Harpctl can't return the HARP Proxy version if HARP Proxy is configured with read-only user access for BDR DCS. The version information can't be stored by a user with read-only permissions. This leads to missing version information for proxy when using harpctl to query version information.
* After fencing the database with the stop database option, if the HARP Manager is restarted and BDR DCS is configured, the database is restarted but in a fenced state. 
* `use_unix_sock` doesn't work when deploying EDB Postgres Advanced Server. The default Unix socket directory isn't determined correctly for EDB Postgres Advanced Server.  

## Release 2.0.1 (2022-1-31)

### Enhancements
  
* BDR consensus now generally available

  HARP offers multiple options for Distributed Consensus Service (DCS) source: etcd and BDR. The BDR consensus option can be used in deployments where etcd isn't present. Use of the BDR consensus option is no longer considered beta and is now supported for use in production environments.
  
* Transport layer proxy now generally available

  HARP offers multiple proxy options for routing connections between the client application and database: application layer (L7) and transport layer (L4). The network layer 4 or transport layer proxy simply forwards network packets, whereas layer 7 terminates network traffic. The transport layer proxy, previously called simple proxy, is no longer considered beta and is now supported for use in production environments.

## Release 2.0.0 (2021-12-01)

### Engine

* Complete rewrite of system in golang to optimize all operations
* Cluster state can now be bootstrapped or revised via YAML

### Configuration

* Rewritten in YAML
* Configuration file changed from `harp.ini` to `config.yml`

### Enhancements

* HARP Proxy deprecates need for HAProxy in supported architecture.

  The use of HARP Router to translate DCS contents into appropriate online or
  offline states for HTTP-based URI requests meant a load balancer or HAProxy
  was necessary to determine the lead master. HARP Proxy now does this 
  automatically without periodic iterative status checks.

* Utilizes DCS key subscription to respond directly to state changes.

  With relevant cluster state changes, the cluster responds immediately, thereby resulting in improved failover and switchover times.

* Compatibility with etcd SSL settings.

  It is now possible to communicate with etcd through SSL encryption.
  
* Zero transaction lag on switchover.

  The new lead node doesn't have transactions routed to it until all replicated transactions are replayed, thereby reducing the potential for conflicts.
  
* Experimental BDR consensus layer

  Using BDR consensus as the Distributed Consensus Service (DCS) reduces amount of change needed for implementations.
  
* Experimental proxy

  Proxy implementation for increased session control.

## Release 1.0.1 (2021-06-23)

### Documentation

* Standardize resolution of the `HARP` acronym

### Bug fixes

* Fix CAMO lag check to accommodate cases where `maximum_camo_lag` is set to `0`

## Release 1.0 (2021-06-15)

### Enhancements

* `--dry-run` option added to `harpctl leader set`
* Minimum configuration values are enforced
* `lock_interval` parameter can be specified as fractions of a second
* Logging and output improvements
* Replication lag query updated to handle parallel apply

### Bug fixes

* `harpctl` returns an error code if `leader set` fails
* Prevent corner-case failure when node peer progress not returned
* Handle potentially empty node record
* Catch unhandled exception when deciding the lead node candidate

## Release 0.2 (2021-02-23)

This is a maintenance release with following changes:

* Documentation available in the EnterpriseDB customer portal
* Report non-availability of nodes other than the lead master
* When using BDR as a DCS layer, fix potential failure situations when a
  BDR node is not running
* Fixes RPM packaging issue preventing a new start on fresh installations

## Release 0.1 (2020-08-13)

This is an initial beta release providing HARP support for BDR, including:

* Use of native BDR (3.6.21 and later) as a consensus layer
* Use of etcd as a consensus layer

Currently HARP doesn't support operation on a physical streaming
replica when BDR is used as a consensus layer.
