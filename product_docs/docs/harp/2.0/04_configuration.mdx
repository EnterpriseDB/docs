title: Configuring HARP for Cluster Management
---

The HARP configuration file follows a standard YAML style formatting which has
been simplified for readability. This file can be found in the `/etc/harp`
directory by default, and is named `config.yml`

The configuration file location can be explicitly provided to all HARP 
executables with the `-f`/`--config` argument.

## Standard Configuration

HARP essentially operates as three components:

* HARP Manager
* HARP Proxy
* harpctl

Each of these use the same standard `config.yml` configuration format, which
should always include the following sections:

* `cluster.name` - The name of the cluster to target for all operations.
* `dcs` - DCS driver and connection configuration for all endpoints.

Essentially this means a standard preamble will always be included for HARP
operations, and will resemble this:

```yaml
cluster:
  name: mycluster

dcs:
  ...
```

Other sections should be considered optional or specific to the named HARP
component.

### Cluster Name

The **`name`** entry under the `cluster` heading is required for _all_ 
interaction with HARP. Each HARP cluster has a name for both disambiguation
purposes and for labeling data within the DCS for the specific cluster.

HARP Managers will write information about the cluster here for consumption by 
HARP Proxy and harpctl. HARP Proxy services will direct traffic to nodes within 
this cluster. The `harpctl` management tool will interact with this cluster.

### DCS Settings

Configuring the Consensus Layer is key to HARP functionality. Without the DCS, 
HARP has nowhere to store cluster metadata, cannot hold leadership elections, 
and so on. Therefore this portion of the configuration is required, though 
certain elements are optional.

All elements should be specified under a section named `dcs` with multiple 
supplementary entries that will be described here.

- **`driver`**: Required type of consensus layer to use. 
  Currently may be `etcd` or `bdr`. Support for `bdr` as a consensus layer is 
  experimental. Using `bdr` as the consensus layer reduces the 
  additional software for consensus storage, but expects a minimum of three 
  full BDR member nodes to maintain quorum during database maintenance.

- **`endpoints`**: Required list of connection strings to contact the DCS.
  Every node of the DCS should be listed here if possible. This ensures HARP 
  will continue to function so long as a majority of the DCS is still 
  operational and reachable via the network.

  Format when using `etcd` as the consensus layer is as follows:
  
  ```yaml
  dcs:
    endpoints:
      - host1:2379
      - host2:2379
      - host3:2379
  ```
  Format when using the experimental `bdr` consensus layer is as follows:
  
  ```yaml
  dcs:
  # only DSN format is supported
    endpoints:
      - "host=host1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres"
      - "host=host2 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres"
      - "host=host3 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres"
  ```
Currently, `bdr` consensus layer requires the first endpoint to point to the local postgres instance.  

- **`request_timeout`**: Time in milliseconds to consider a request as failed.
  If HARP makes a request to the DCS and receives no response within this time
  period, it should consider the operation as failed. This may cause the issue
  to be logged as an error or retried, depending on the nature of the request.
  Default: 250.

The following DCS SSL settings only apply when ```driver: etcd``` is set in the 
configuration file.
 
- **`ssl`**: Either `on` or `off` to enable SSL communication with the DCS.
  Default: `off`

- **`ssl_ca_file`**: Client SSL Certificate Authority (CA) file.

- **`ssl_cert_file`**: Client SSL certificate file.

- **`ssl_key_file`**: Client SSL key file.

#### Example

Here is an example of how HARP should be configured to contact an etcd DCS
consisting of three nodes:

```yaml
dcs:
  driver: etcd
  endpoints:
    - host1:2379
    - host2:2379
    - host3:2379
```

### HARP Manager Specific

Besides the generic service options required for all HARP components, Manager
needs at least one more setting:

- **`log_level`**: One of `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, or `CRITICAL`
  which may alter the amount of log output from HARP services.

- **`name`**: Required name of the Postgres node represented by this Manager.
  Since Manager can only represent a specific node, that node is named here and 
  also serves to name this Manager. If this is a BDR node, it should match the 
  value used at node creation when executing the 
  `bdr.create_node(node_name, ...)` function and as reported by the
  `bdr.local_node_summary.node_name` view column. Alphanumeric characters
  and underscores only.

Thus a complete configuration example for HARP Manager could resemble this:

```yaml
cluster:
  name: mycluster

dcs:
  driver: etcd
  endpoints:
    - host1:2379
    - host2:2379
    - host3:2379

manager:
  name: node1
  log_level: INFO
```

Note that this is essentially the DCS contact information, any associated 
service customizations, the name of the cluster itself, and the name of the
node. All other settings are associated with the node itself and is stored
within the DCS.

Please read the section on [Node Bootstrapping](05_bootstrapping) for more about
specific node settings and initializing nodes to be managed by HARP Manager.

### HARP Proxy Specific

Some configuration options are specific to HARP Proxy. These affect how the
daemon itself operates, and thus are currently located in the `config.yml` file
itself.

Proxy-based settings may be specified under a `proxy` heading, and include:

- **`location`**: Required name of Location HARP Proxy should represent.
  HARP Proxy nodes are directly tied to the Location where they are running, as
  they always direct traffic to the current Lead Master node. This must be
  specified for any defined proxy.

- **`log_level`**: One of `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, or `CRITICAL`
  which may alter the amount of log output from HARP services.

  * Default: `INFO`

- **`name`**: Name of this specific Proxy.
  Each Proxy node is named to ensure any associated statistics or operating
  state are available in status checks and other interactive events.

- **`type`**: Specifies whether pgbouncer or the experimental built-in passthrough proxy will be used.  All proxies must use the same proxy type.  It is recommended to only experiment with the simple proxy in combination with the experimental BDR DCS.
  May be `pgbouncer` or `builtin`.
  
  * Default: `pgbouncer`

- **`pgbouncer_bin_dir`**: Directory where PgBouncer binaries are located.
  As HARP utilizes PgBouncer binaries, it needs to know where these are 
  located. This can be platform or distribution dependent, so has no
  default. The assumption is that the appropriate binaries are in the 
  environment's `PATH` variable otherwise.

#### Example

HARP Proxy requires the cluster name, DCS connection settings, location, and
name of the proxy in operation. An example lies below:

```yaml
cluster:
  name: mycluster

dcs:
  driver: etcd
  endpoints:
    - host1:2379
    - host2:2379
    - host3:2379

proxy:
  name: proxy1
  location: dc1
  pgbouncer_bin_dir: /usr/sbin
```

All other attributes are obtained from the DCS upon Proxy startup.

## Run-Time Directives

While it is possible to confige HARP Manager, HARP Proxy, or harpctl with a
minimum of YAML in the `config.yml` file, some customizations are held within
the DCS itself. These values must either initialized via bootstrap or set
specifically with `harpctl set` directives.

This section will outline these, and how they may be specified.

### Cluster Wide

Settings here should be set under a `cluster` YAML heading during bootstrap, or
modified with a `harpctl set cluster` command.

- **`event_sync_interval`**: Time in milliseconds to wait for synchronization.
  When events occur within HARP, they do so asynchronously across the cluster.
  HARP Managers start operating immediately when they detect metadata changes,
  and HARP Proxies may pause traffic and start reconfiguring endpoints. This is
  a safety interval that is meant to roughly approximate the maximum amount of 
  event time skew that may exist between all HARP components.
  
  For example, suppose Node A goes offline and HARP Manager on Node B commonly 
  receives this event 5 milliseconds before Node C. A setting of at least 5ms
  would then be necessary to ensure all HARP Manager services have received the
  event before they begin to process it.

  This also applies to HARP Proxy.

### Node Directives

Most node-oriented settings can be changed and subsequently applied while HARP 
Manager is active. These items are retained in the DCS after initial bootstrap, 
and thus may be modified without altering a configuration file.

Settings here should be set under a `node` YAML heading during bootstrap, or
modified with a `harpctl set node` command.

- **`camo_enforcement`**: Whether CAMO queue state should be strictly enforced.
  When set to `strict`, HARP will never allow switchover or failover to a BDR 
  CAMO partner node unless it is fully caught up with the entire CAMO queue at 
  the time of the migration. When set to `lag_only`, only standard lag 
  thresholds such as `maximum_camo_lag` are applied.

- **`dcs_reconnect_interval`**: The interval, measured in ms, between attempts that a disconnected node tries to reconnect to the DCS. 

  * Default 1000.

- **`dsn`**: Required full connection string to the managed Postgres node.
  This parameter applies equally to all HARP services and enables
  micro-architectures which run only one service per container.

  !!! Note
      HARP sets the `sslmode` argument to `require` by default and will prevent 
      connections to servers that do not require SSL. To disable this behavior, 
      explicitly set this parameter to a more permissive value such as 
      `disable`, `allow`, or `prefer`.

- **`db_data_dir`**: Required Postgres data directory.
  This is required by HARP Manager to start, stop, or reload the Postgres 
  service. It is also the default location for configuration files, which may 
  be used at a later time for controlling promotion of streaming replicas.

- **`db_conf_dir`**: Location of Postgres configuration files.
  Some platforms prefer storing Postgres confgiuration files away from the 
  Postgres data directory itself. In these cases, this should be set to that
  expected location.

  * Default `db_data_dir`
 
- **`db_log_file`**: Location of Postgres log file.
  
  * Default `/tmp/pg_ctl.out`

- **`fence_node_on_dcs_failure`**: In the event HARP is unable to reach the DCS, several readiness keys and the leadership lease itself will expire. This will implicitly prevent a node from routing consideration. However, such a node is not officially fenced, and the manager will not stop monitoring the database if `stop_database_when_fenced` is set to false.

  * Default: False
 
- **`leader_lease_duration`**: Amount of time in seconds the Lead Master
  lease will persist if not refreshed. This allows any HARP Manager a certain 
  grace period to refresh the lock, before expiration allows another node to 
  obtain the Lead Master lock instead.

  * Default: 30

- **`lease_refresh_interval`**: Amount of time in milliseconds between 
  refreshes of the Lead Master lease. This essentially controls the time 
  between each series of checks HARP Manager performs against its assigned 
  Postgres node, and when the status of the node is updated in the Consensus 
  layer.

  * Default: 5000
- **`max_dcs_failures`**: The amount of DCS request failures before marking a node as fenced according to fence_node_on_dcs_failure. This prevents transient communication disruptions from shutting down database nodes. 

   * Default: 10
  
- **`maximum_lag`**: Highest allowable variance (in bytes) between last
  recorded LSN of previous Lead Master and this node before being allowed to
  take the Lead Master lock. This prevents nodes experiencing terminal amounts
  of lag from taking the Lead Master lock. Set to -1 to disable this check.

  * Default: 1048576 (1MB)

- **`maximum_camo_lag`**: Highest allowable variance (in bytes) between last
  received LSN and applied LSN between this node and its CAMO partner(s).
  This should only apply to clusters where CAMO is both available and enabled.
  Thus this only applies to BDR EE clusters where `pg2q.enable_camo` is set.
  Clusters with particularly stringent CAMO apply queue restrictions should set
  this very low, or even to 0 to avoid any unapplied CAMO transactions. Set to
  -1 to disable this check.

  * Default: 1048576 (1MB)

- **`ready_status_duration`**: Amount of time in seconds the node's readiness 
  status will persist if not refreshed. This is a failsafe that will remove a
  node from being contacted by HARP Proxy if the HARP Manager in charge if it
  stops operating.

  * Default: 30

- **`db_bin_dir`**: Directory where Postgres binaries are located.
  As HARP utilizes Postgres binaries, such as `pg_ctl`, it needs to know where 
  these are located. This can be platform or distribution dependent, so has no 
  default. The assumption is that the appropriate binaries are in the 
  environment's `PATH` variable otherwise.

- **`priority`**: Any numeric value.
  Any node where this option is set to -1 will be unable to take the Lead Master role, even when attempting to explicitly set the Lead Master using `harpctl`.

  * Default: 100

- **`safety_interval`**: Time in milliseconds required before allowing routing
  to a newly promoted Lead Master. This is intended to allow automated checks
  against HARP Router to fail across the cluster before transitioning new
  connections to the promoted node. This helps enforce fully synchronized
  routing targets. 0 to disable.

  * Default: 100

- **`stop_database_when_fenced`**: Rather than simply removing a node from all possible routing, stop the database on a node when it is fenced. This is an extra safeguard to prevent data from other sources than HARP Proxy from reaching the database, or in case proxies are unable to disconnect clients for some other reason. 

  * Default: False
  
- **`consensus_timeout`**: Amount of milliseconds before aborting a read or
  write to the consensus layer. In the event the consensus layer loses
  quorum or becomes unreachable, we want near-instant errors rather than
  infinite timeouts. This prevents blocking behavior in such cases.
  Note: When using `bdr` as the consensus layer, the highest recognized timeout
  is 1000ms.

  * Default: 250

- **`use_unix_socket`**: Specifies that HARP Manager should prefer to use 
  unix sockets to connect to the database.

  * Default: False

All of these run-time directives can be modified via `harpctl`. Consider if we
wished to decrease the `lease_refresh_interval` to 100ms on `node1`:

```bash
harpctl set node node1 lease_refresh_interval=100
```

### Proxy Directives

Certain settings to the Proxy can be changed while the service is active. These 
items are retained in the DCS after initial bootstrap, and thus may be modified 
without altering a configuration file. Many of these settings are direct 
mappings to their PgBouncer equivalent, and we will note these where relevant.

Settings here should be set under a `proxies` YAML heading during bootstrap, or
modified with a `harpctl set proxy` command.

- **`auth_file`**: The full path to a PgBouncer-style `userlist.txt` file.
  HARP Proxy will use this file to store a `pgbouncer` user which will have
  access to PgBouncer's Admin database. This file may be used for other users
  as well. Proxy will modify this file to add and modify the password for the
  `pgbouncer` user.

  * Default `/etc/harp/userlist.txt`

- **`auth_type`**: What type of Postgres authentication to use for password
  matching. This is actually a PgBouncer setting and is not fully compatible
  with the Postgres `pg_hba.conf` capabilities. We recommend using `md5`, `pam`
  `cert`, or `scram-sha-256`.

  * Default `md5`

- **`auth_query`**: Query to verify a user’s password with Postgres.
  Direct access to `pg_shadow` requires admin rights. It’s preferable to use a
  non-superuser that calls a `SECURITY DEFINER` function instead. If using
  TPAexec to create a cluster, a function named `pgbouncer_get_auth` will be
  installed on all databases within the `pg_catalog` namespace to fulfill this
  purpose.

- **`auth_user`**: If `auth_user` is set, then any user not specified in
  `auth_file` will be queried through the `auth_query` query from `pg_shadow` 
  in the database, using `auth_user`. The password of `auth_user` will be
  taken from `auth_file`.

- **`client_tls_ca_file`**: Root certificate file to validate client
  certificates. Requires `client_tls_sslmode` to be set.

- **`client_tls_cert_file`**: Certificate for private key. Clients can
  validate it. Requires `client_tls_sslmode` to be set.

- **`client_tls_key_file`**: Private key for PgBouncer to accept client
  connections. Requires `client_tls_sslmode` to be set.

- **`client_tls_protocols`**: Which TLS protocol versions are allowed for 
  client connections.
  Allowed values: `tlsv1.0`, `tlsv1.1`, `tlsv1.2`, `tlsv1.3`. 
  Shortcuts: `all` (tlsv1.0,tlsv1.1,tlsv1.2,tlsv1.3), 
  `secure` (tlsv1.2,tlsv1.3), `legacy` (all).

  * Default `secure`

- **`client_tls_sslmode`**: Whether to enable client SSL functionality.
  May be one of `disable` `allow` `prefer` `require` `verify-ca` `verify-full`.

  * Default `disable`

- **`database_name`**: Required name that represents which database clients
  will use when connecting to HARP Proxy. This is a stable endpoint that will 
  not change and points to the current node, database name, port, etc., 
  necessary to connect to the Lead Master. The global value `*` may be used
  here so all connections get directed to this target regardless of database
  name.

- **`default_pool_size`**: The maximum amount of active connections to allow
  per database / user combination. This is for connection pooling purposes,
  but will do nothing in session pooling mode. This is a PgBouncer setting.

  * Default 25

- **`ignore_startup_parameters`**: By default, PgBouncer allows only
  parameters it can keep track of in startup packets: `client_encoding`,
  `datestyle`, `timezone`, and `standard_conforming_strings`. All other
  parameters will raise an error. To allow other parameters, they can be
  specified here so that PgBouncer knows that they are handled by the admin
  and it can ignore them. It is often necessary to set this to 
  `extra_float_digits` for Java applications to function properly.

  * Default `extra_float_digits`

- **`listen_address`**: IP address(es) where Proxy should listen for
  connections. Used by pgbouncer and builtin proxy.

  * Default 0.0.0.0

- **`listen_port`**: System Port where Proxy should listen for connections. 
     Used by pgbouncer and builtin proxy.

  * Default 6432

- **`max_client_conn`**: The total maximum amount of active client 
  connections that are allowed on the Proxy. This can be many orders of 
  magnitude greater than `default_pool_size`, as these are all connections that
  have yet to be assigned a session, or have released a session for use by
  another client connection. This is a PgBouncer setting.

  * Default 100

- **`monitor_interval`**: Time in seconds between Proxy checks of PgBouncer.
  Since HARP Proxy manages PgBouncer as the actual connection management
  layer, it needs to periodically check various status and stats to verify
  it's still operational. Some of this information may also be logged or
  registered to the DCS.

  * Default 5

- **`server_tls_protocols`**: Which TLS protocol versions are allowed for
  server connections. 
  Allowed values: `tlsv1.0`, `tlsv1.1`, `tlsv1.2`, `tlsv1.3`. 
  Shortcuts: `all` (tlsv1.0,tlsv1.1,tlsv1.2,tlsv1.3), 
  `secure` (tlsv1.2,tlsv1.3), `legacy` (all).

  * Default `secure`

- **`server_tls_sslmode`**: Whether to enable server SSL functionality.
  May be one of `disable` `allow` `prefer` `require` `verify-ca` `verify-full`.

  * Default `disable`

- **`session_transfer_mode`**: Method by which to transfer sessions.
  May be one of `fast` `wait` `reconnect`.

  * Default `wait`

- **`server_transfer_timeout`**: The number of seconds Harp proxy will wait before giving up on a PAUSE and issuing a KILL command.
  
  * Default 30

The following two options only apply when using the built-in proxy.  

- **`keepalive`**: The number of seconds the built-in proxy will wait before sending a keepalive message to an idle leader connection.
  
  * Default 5


- **`timeout`**: The number of seconds the built-in proxy will wait before giving up on connecting to the leader.
  
  * Default 1

When using `harpctl` to change any of these settings for all proxies, use the 
`global` keyword in place of the proxy name. Example:

```bash
harpctl set proxy global max_client_conn 1000
```
