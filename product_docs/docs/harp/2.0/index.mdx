    HARP 2.0 is a complete rewrite of HARP 1.0 and is currently in Beta status. 
    It should not be used in any Production, Pre-Production, User Acceptance 
    Testing, or other critical environment. It is supplied in its current form 
    as-is for testing purposes only. While not likely, features, functionality, 
    syntax, or other aspects may be changed without warning in future releases 
    to facilitate a production-quality release.

High Availability Routing for Postgres (HARP) is a cluster management tool for 
[Bi-directional Replication (BDR)](/bdr/latest) clusters. The core design of 
the tool is to route all application traffic within a single data center or 
region to only one node at a time. This node, designated the Lead Master, acts 
as the principle write target to reduce the potential for data conflicts.

HARP leverages a distributed consensus model to determine availability of the 
BDR nodes in the cluster. On failure or unavailability of the Lead Master, HARP 
elects a new Lead Master and redirects application traffic accordingly.

Together with the core capabilities of BDR, this mechanism of routing 
application traffic to the Lead Master node enables fast failover and 
switchover without risk of data loss.

HARP requires BDR versions 3.6 and above.
