## Release 2.0.1 (2022-1-31)

### Enhancements
  
* BDR consensus now generally available

  HARP offers multiple options for Distributed Consensus Service (DCS) source: etcd and BDR. The BDR consensus option can be used in deployments where etcd is not present. Use of the BDR consensus option is no longer considered beta and is now supported for use in production environments.
  
* Transport layer proxy now generally available

  HARP offers multiple proxy options for routing connections between the client application and database: application layer (L7) and transport layer (L4). The network layer 4 or transport layer proxy simply forwards network packets, whereas layer 7 terminates network traffic. The transport layer proxy, previously called simple proxy, is no longer considered beta and is now supported for use in production environments.

## Release 2.0.0 (2021-12-01)

### Engine

* Complete rewrite of system in golang to optimize all operations
* Cluster state can now be bootstrapped or revised via YAML

### Configuration

* Rewritten in YAML
* Configuration file changed from `harp.ini` to `config.yml`

### Enhancements

* HARP Proxy deprecates need for HAProxy in supported architecture.

  The use of HARP Router to translate DCS contents into appropriate online or
  offline states for HTTP-based URI requests meant a load balancer or HAProxy
  was necessary to determine the Lead Master. HARP Proxy now does this 
  automatically without periodic iterative status checks.

* Utilizes DCS key subscription to respond directly to state changes.

  With relevant cluster state changes, the cluster will respond immediately, thereby resulting in improved failover and switchover times.

* Compatibility with etcd SSL settings.

  It is now possible to communicate with etcd through SSL encryption.
  
* Zero transaction lag on switchover.

  The new lead node will not have transactions routed to it until all replicated transactions are replayed, thereby reducing the potential for conflicts.
  
* Experimental BDR Consensus layer

  Using BDR Consensus as the Distributed Consensus Service (DCS) reduces amount of change needed for implementations.
  
* Experimental Proxy

  Proxy implementation for increased session control.

## Release 1.0.1 (2021-06-23)

### Documentation

* Standardize resolution of the `HARP` acronym

### Bug fixes

* Fix CAMO lag check to accommodate cases where `maximum_camo_lag` is set to `0`

## Release 1.0 (2021-06-15)

### Enhancements

* `--dry-run` option added to `harpctl leader set`
* minimum configuration values will be enforced
* `lock_interval` parameter can be specified as fractions of a second
* logging and output improvements
* replication lag query updated to handle parallel apply

### Bug fixes

* `harpctl` returns an error code if `leader set` fails
* prevent corner-case failure when node peer progress not returned
* handle potentially empty node record
* catch unhandled exception when deciding the lead node candidate

## Release 0.2 (2021-02-23)

This is a maintenance release with following changes:

* documentation available via the EnterpriseDB customer portal
* report non-availability of nodes other than the lead master
* when using BDR as a DCS layer, fix potential failure situations when a
  BDR node is not running
* fixes RPM packaging issue preventing a new start on fresh installations

## Release 0.1 (2020-08-13)

This is an initial beta release providing HARP support for BDR, including:

* Usage of native BDR (3.6.21 and later) as a consensus layer
* Usage of etcd as a consensus layer

Note that currently HARP does not support operation on a physical streaming
replica when BDR is used as a consensus layer.
