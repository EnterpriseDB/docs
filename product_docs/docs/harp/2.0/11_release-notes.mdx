## Release 2.0.0 (2021-09-30)

### Engine

* Complete rewrite of system in golang to optimize all operations
* Cluster state can now be bootstrapped or revised via YAML

### Configuration

* Rewritten in YAML
* Configuration file changed from `harp.ini` to `config.yml`

### Enhancements

* HARP Proxy deprecates need for HAProxy in recommended architecture.

  The use of HARP Router to translate DCS contents into appropriate online or
  offline states for HTTP-based URI requests meant a load balancer or HAProxy
  was necessary to determine the Lead Master. HARP Proxy now does this 
  automatically without periodic iterative status checks.

* Utilizes DCS key subscription to respond directly to state changes.

  Now when node state or important resource leases are modified by HARP Manager 
  or `harpctl`, all relevant portions of the cluster will respond immediately 
  rather than after a loop polling interval. This makes failover and switchover
  events much more responsive than in HARP 1.x.

* Compatibility with etcd SSL settings.

  It is now possible to communicate with etcd through SSL encryption.

## Release 1.0.1 (2021-06-23)

### Documentation

* Standardize resolution of the `HARP` acronym

### Bug fixes

* Fix CAMO lag check to accommodate cases where `maximum_camo_lag` is set to `0`

## Release 1.0 (2021-06-15)

### Enhancements

* `--dry-run` option added to `harpctl leader set`
* minimum configuration values will be enforced
* `lock_interval` parameter can be specified as fractions of a second
* logging and output improvements
* replication lag query updated to handle parallel apply

### Bug fixes

* `harpctl` returns an error code if `leader set` fails
* prevent corner-case failure when node peer progress not returned
* handle potentially empty node record
* catch unhandled exception when deciding the lead node candidate

## Release 0.2 (2021-02-23)

This is a maintenance release with following changes:

* documentation available via the EnterpriseDB customer portal
* report non-availability of nodes other than the lead master
* when using BDR as a DCS layer, fix potential failure situations when a
  BDR node is not running
* fixes RPM packaging issue preventing a new start on fresh installations

## Release 0.1 (2020-08-13)

This is an initial beta release providing HARP support for BDR, including:

* Usage of native BDR (3.6.21 and later) as a consensus layer
* Usage of etcd as a consensus layer

Note that currently HARP does not support operation on a physical streaming
replica when BDR is used as a consensus layer.
