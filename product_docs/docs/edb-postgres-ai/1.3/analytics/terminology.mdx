description: Glossary of key terms used in the Analytics Accelerator and Hybrid Manager analytics features.
---

This page defines key terms used in the Analytics Accelerator and Hybrid Manager (HM) analytics features.

Use it as a quick reference when exploring concepts, how-tos, and feature guides.

---

## Apache Iceberg

An open table format for large analytic datasets stored in object storage.
Provides schema evolution, time travel, and interoperability with many analytics engines (Spark, Trino, Flink, and Postgres).

[Learn more](../../iceberg)

---

## Delta Lake

An open table format and storage layer that adds ACID transactions and reliability to data lakes.
Built on Parquet files with a _delta_log transaction log.

[Learn more](../../delta_lake)

---

## Data Lakehouse

A modern architecture that combines elements of data lakes and data warehouses:

- Stores data in object storage
- Supports open table formats (Iceberg, Delta Lake)
- Provides fast SQL analytics using vectorized query engines
- Decouples storage from compute

Related concept: [Data Lakehouse](generic-concepts#data-lakehouse)

---

## EDB Postgres Lakehouse Cluster

A managed analytical compute cluster provisioned by Hybrid Manager to run fast SQL queries on data stored in object storage.

- Supports Iceberg and Delta Lake formats
- Uses a vectorized query engine (Apache DataFusion)
- Separates storage and compute for scalability and cost efficiency

[Learn more](../../lakehouse)

---

## EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD)

An advanced, distributed version of Postgres:

- Provides high availability and multi-master replication
- Enables advanced data tiering patterns (Tiered Tables)
- Works seamlessly with Lakehouse clusters for scalable analytics

[Learn more](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/overview/database_types/distributed_highavailability/)

---

## Tiered Tables

A feature that uses PGD **AutoPartition** to manage large time-based datasets:

- **Hot data** stays in the PGD transactional cluster
- **Cold data** is offloaded to object storage as Apache Iceberg tables
- Queries can transparently access both hot and cold data

[Learn more](../../tiered_tables)

---

## PGAA (Postgres Generic Analytics Adapter)

An extension that enables Postgres to:

- Query open table formats (Iceberg, Delta Lake)
- Define **external tables** that map to object storage
- Power Lakehouse cluster queries
- Enable PGD Tiered Table offloading and querying

[Example in use](/edb-postgres-ai/analytics/learn/how-to/query-iceberg-existing-tables)

---

## PGFS (Postgres File System)

An extension that defines **storage locations** Postgres can use to access object storage.

- Used by PGAA and PGD for Iceberg and Delta Lake access
- Supports AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, and compatible services
- Must be configured on each Lakehouse or PGD cluster that needs to query object storage

[Example in use](/edb-postgres-ai/analytics/learn/how-to/configure-delta-pgfs)

---

## AutoPartition

A capability of PGD BDR (Bi-Directional Replication):

- Automatically creates time-based partitions for a PGD table
- Automatically offloads older partitions to object storage when configured with an `analytics_offload_period`

[Example in use](/edb-postgres-ai/analytics/learn/how-to/configure-tiered-autopartition)

---

## BDR Analytics Table

An internal PGD concept:

- The **analytics_table** view tracks which PGD tables are marked for Tiered Table offload
- Tracks the state of each table and offload progress

Useful for monitoring and validating Tiered Table behavior.

[Example in use](/edb-postgres-ai/analytics/learn/how-to/monitor-tiered-tables)

---

## Iceberg Catalog

A metadata service that tracks Iceberg table schemas, locations, and versions:

- Required for full interoperability across multiple engines (Spark, Trino, Postgres)
- Can be HM-managed (Lakekeeper) or external (AWS Glue, Nessie, Polaris, etc.)
- PGAA and PGD both support connecting to an Iceberg REST catalog

[Example in use](/edb-postgres-ai/analytics/learn/how-to/configure-iceberg-catalog)

---

## Lakekeeper

An HM-managed Iceberg catalog service:

- Provides a central catalog for Iceberg tables
- Supports PGD Tiered Table offload with catalog integration
- Supports Lakehouse cluster queries through catalog-based table discovery
- Uses Iceberg REST Catalog API

[Example in use](/edb-postgres-ai/analytics/learn/how-to/configure-iceberg-catalog)

---

## Open Table Formats

Standardized file layouts and metadata formats used for analytics:

- **Apache Iceberg**
- **Delta Lake**

Enable multi-engine access to the same data (Spark, Trino, Postgres Lakehouse, etc.).

[Learn more](generic-concepts#open-table-formats)

---

## Vectorized Query Engine

An analytics engine that processes data in **columnar batches** (instead of row-by-row):

- Accelerates analytics queries
- Makes use of modern CPU features (SIMD)
- Powers Lakehouse cluster query performance

EDB Lakehouse clusters embed [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/) for this.

---

## Data Tiering

The practice of storing **hot**, **warm**, and **cold** data on different storage tiers:

- Hot → fast transactional PGD nodes
- Cold → object storage (Iceberg tables)
- Tiered Tables automate this pattern in Postgres + HM

Related concept: [Data Tiering](generic-concepts#data-tiering)

---

## Separation of Storage and Compute

A pattern used by Lakehouse architectures:

- Store data in **object storage** (independently scaled)
- Scale analytical compute (Lakehouse clusters) independently of storage

Enables cost-efficient, elastic analytics architectures.

Related concept: [Separation of Storage and Compute](generic-concepts#separation-of-storage-and-compute)
