# PGD catalog reads from a non-leader node

Connect to a non-leader node in PGD and verify that you can read catalog-managed tables and offloaded views.

## Identify PGD leader and read nodes

```sql
SELECT * FROM bdr.node_group_routing_summary;
```

## Connect to a non-leader (example with kubectl)

```bash
kubectl -n <group> exec <non-leader-pod> -c postgres -it -- psql bdrdb
```

Run these queries from the non-leader session:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tpch_sf_1.lineitem;
SELECT * FROM tpch_sf_1.lineitem LIMIT 1;
```
