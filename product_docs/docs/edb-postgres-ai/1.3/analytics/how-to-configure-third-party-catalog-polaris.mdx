# Configure Polaris (Snowflake Open Catalog)

This guide shows how to connect PGAA to a third-party Iceberg catalog using Snowflake Open Catalog (Polaris). It includes obtaining a short-lived OAuth token, registering the catalog in PGAA, and setting it as the analytics write target.

Status: Verified PGAA works with Polaris; users must obtain the OAuth client‑credentials token manually (valid ~1 hour). PGAA may error when querying catalogs with spaces in their names.

## Steps

1) Obtain a Polaris OAuth token and configure PGAA to use it

```sql
-- example placeholder for token flow; see detailed guide for Python helper
SELECT pgaa.add_catalog('snowflake_polaris','iceberg-rest','{"url":"<polaris REST>","token":"$POLARIS_TOKEN"}');
```

2) Attach/import catalog

```sql
SELECT pgaa.import_catalog('snowflake_polaris');
```

Notes: OAuth tokens are short‑lived; refresh as needed before imports/reads. Catalog names with spaces may be problematic.
