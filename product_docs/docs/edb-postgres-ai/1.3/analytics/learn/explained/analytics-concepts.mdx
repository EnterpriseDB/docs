## EDB’s vision for analytics on Postgres

EDB implements modern analytics patterns through the Analytics Accelerator, enabling Postgres to serve as a unified platform for both operational and analytical workloads.

Key principles:

-   Perform analytics **close to operational data**, reducing data movement and latency
-   Use **open formats** and **vectorized query engines** for fast analytics on object storage
-   Support **data tiering** to balance cost and performance
-   Separate **compute and storage** to allow independent scaling
-   Manage the entire stack via Hybrid Manager

## Key EDB solutions and technologies

### EDB Postgres Lakehouse

Lakehouse architecture enables EDB Postgres to query data in object storage:

-   Lakehouse nodes query data in **open table formats** (Iceberg, Delta Lake)
-   Vectorized query execution powered by [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/)
-   Columnar storage formats such as **Parquet**
-   Separation of compute and storage

-   [Vectorized query engines](./generic-concepts#vectorized-query-engines)
-   [Separation of storage and compute](./generic-concepts#separation-of-storage-and-compute)
-   [Open table formats](./generic-concepts#open-table-formats)

* * *

### Vectorized query optimization

Analytics Accelerator embeds [Apache DataFusion](https://datafusion.apache.org/) in Lakehouse nodes:

-   Processes data as **columnar batches**
-   Uses **SIMD** instructions to accelerate performance
-   Optimized for **Parquet-formatted data**

* * *

### EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) and Tiered Tables

EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) powers Tiered Tables:

-   **BDR AutoPartition** manages time-based partitioning
-   Cold data is automatically **offloaded to object storage** (Iceberg tables)
-   Hot data remains in transactional PGD nodes

This balances operational performance with cost-efficient historical data access.

-   [Data tiering](./generic-concepts#data-tiering)
-   [ETL / ELT](./generic-concepts#etl--elt)

* * *

### Advanced query optimization

Analytics Accelerator improves core Postgres capabilities for analytics:

-   Enhanced parallel query processing
-   Optimized join algorithms for analytical workloads
-   Tight integration with vectorized engines for high-performance OLAP queries

## Analytics and AI/ML workloads

Analytics Accelerator supports traditional analytics and AI/ML data pipelines:

-   Lakehouse nodes provide efficient access to large datasets used in model training
-   Tiered data pipelines support cost-effective AI/ML staging patterns
-   Open table formats enable integration with vector search and **retrieval augmented generation (RAG)** workflows

-   [Vector embeddings](./generic-concepts#vector-embeddings)
-   [Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)](./generic-concepts#retrieval-augmented-generation-rag)

## How EDB implements analytics across products

### Hybrid Manager (HM)

Hybrid Manager acts as the control plane:

-   Provision and manage **Lakehouse clusters**
-   Configure and monitor **Tiered Tables**
-   Manage **storage locations**, **catalog connections**, and **compute nodes**

### EDB Postgres Advanced Server / Extended Server

EDB Postgres Advanced Server adds:

-   Improved parallel query capabilities
-   Advanced SQL features helpful for analytics
-   Native support for PGAA (Postgres Generic Analytics Adapter) features

### EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD)

PGD provides the foundation for:

-   High-availability transactional workloads
-   Data tiering and offloading (Tiered Tables)
-   Scalable architectures that integrate with Lakehouse clusters
