description: Step-by-step guide to create a Lakehouse cluster in Hybrid Manager for fast analytics on object storage.
---



This guide explains how to create a **Lakehouse cluster** in Hybrid Manager (HM).
Lakehouse clusters provide **scalable analytical compute** for fast queries on **Apache Iceberg** or **Delta Lake** tables stored in object storage.

For architectural background, see [Lakehouse clusters in Hybrid Manager](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/analytics/lakehouse.mdx).

## Why create a Lakehouse cluster?

By creating a Lakehouse cluster:

- You unlock the ability to **run fast Postgres SQL queries on large datasets** in object storage.
- You can query **Tiered Tables offloaded from PGD** or **external Iceberg/Delta Lake tables**.
- You provide compute for **BI tools and ad-hoc analytics** on your lakehouse data.

This is a foundational step for building your analytics architecture in Hybrid Manager.

## Goals

After completing this How-To, you will be able to:

- Deploy a Lakehouse cluster.
- Connect to it using standard Postgres clients.
- Configure storage and catalogs for querying Iceberg and Delta Lake tables.
- Use the cluster to query existing or newly defined lakehouse tables.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

- You have access to a Hybrid Manager environment with permissions to create Lakehouse clusters.
- You have object storage available (S3, GCS, MinIO, etc.).
- You have Iceberg or Delta Lake tables available — or plan to define them after cluster creation.
- You have an Iceberg catalog prepared if working with Iceberg tables:
- [Configure an Iceberg REST catalog connection](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/analytics/how-to-iceberg-reads-writes-with-catalog)

## Steps

### Step 1: Initiate cluster creation

- In the HM dashboard, click **Create New**.
- Select **Lakehouse Analytics** or **Analytical Cluster**.
- Confirm that you are creating an Analytics Cluster for querying open lakehouse formats.

### Step 2: Choose your path

You will be prompted to choose:

- **Templates** — Use a pre-configured template (if available).
- **Custom build** — Click **Start from Scratch** for full configuration control (recommended for most cases).

### Step 3: Configure cluster settings

#### Cluster Settings

- **Cluster name** — Enter a unique name (e.g. `sales_analytics_lakehouse`).
- **Password** — Enter a strong superuser password.
- **Tags** — Optionally add tags (e.g. `environment:production`, `project:q3-reporting`).
- **Deployment location** — Select cloud provider and region.
- **Database type** — Choose EDB Postgres Extended Server or Advanced Server.
- **Postgres version** — Select supported version with Lakehouse extensions.
- **Instance size** — Select compute size appropriate for your workload.

#### Additional Settings

- **Networking** — Configure VPC, subnet, security groups, IP whitelisting.
- **Backups** — Configure backup settings if applicable.

### Step 4: Review and create

- Review the **Cluster Summary**.
- Confirm all settings.
- Click **Create Cluster**.
- Monitor progress in the HM dashboard.

## What you can do next

Now that your Lakehouse cluster is provisioned, you can:

- **Connect to the cluster** to run SQL queries:
Use standard Postgres clients (psql, DBeaver, pgAdmin) with HM-provided connection details.

- **Configure storage and catalogs to access data:**
- [Configure a PGFS storage location](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/pgfs/) — if querying Delta Lake or filesystem-based Iceberg.
- [Configure an Iceberg REST catalog connection](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/analytics/how-to-iceberg-reads-writes-with-catalog) — if querying catalog-managed Iceberg tables or using PGD Tiered Tables.

- **Define and query Lakehouse tables:**
- [Read Iceberg and Delta Lake tables](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/analytics/how-to-lakehouse-read-with-without-catalog)

- **Query Tiered Tables offloaded from PGD:**
- Learn concepts for [Tiered Tables](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/analytics/tiered_tables)
