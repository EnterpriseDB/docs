Hybrid Manager enables you to build modern data lakehouse and analytics solutions for EDB Postgres.

This page introduces key concepts as they are applied in Hybrid Manager — with links to detailed explanations in the [Analytics Hub](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/analytics) for background.

## Architecture overview

Hybrid Manager integrates the following layers:

- **Lakehouse Clusters** for scalable analytical compute
- **Object Storage** for cost-efficient analytical data storage
- **PGD Clusters** for transactional workloads and automated Tiered Tables offload
- **Catalog Services** (HM-managed or external) for metadata and interoperability
- **PGAA and PGFS** to bridge Postgres with the data lake

This architecture enables both Postgres-first and multi-engine data lakehouse designs.

For a general introduction, see [What is a Postgres Lakehouse](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/analytics/lakehouse).

## Lakehouse Clusters in Hybrid Manager

Lakehouse Clusters provide scalable analytical compute in Hybrid Manager:

- Provisioned and managed through HM
- Equipped with PGAA extensions for vectorized query execution
- Designed to query data in object storage (Iceberg, Delta Lake)
- Interoperable with external tools (Spark, Trino)

Lakehouse Clusters are central to analytics in Hybrid Manager.

## Apache Iceberg in Hybrid Manager

Hybrid Manager integrates Iceberg as the primary table format for offloaded and analytical data:

- PGD clusters offload data to Iceberg format for Tiered Tables
- Lakehouse Clusters query Iceberg tables efficiently
- Catalog services (Lakekeeper or external) manage Iceberg table metadata

Iceberg provides an open and reliable foundation for lakehouse architectures in HM.

## Delta Lake in Hybrid Manager

Delta Lake provides additional flexibility:

- Lakehouse Clusters can query existing Delta Lake tables in object storage
- Common in environments with Spark/Databricks pipelines
- Delta Lake support in HM is currently read-only

Hybrid Manager enables Postgres-based analytics on Delta Lake data without ETL.

## Tiered Tables in Hybrid Manager

Tiered Tables provide automated lifecycle management of large time-series or historical datasets:

- PGD clusters use BDR AutoPartition to manage partitions
- Older partitions are offloaded automatically to object storage in Iceberg format
- Lakehouse Clusters and PGD parent tables can query both hot and cold data

Tiered Tables are a key optimization pattern for combining transactional and analytical workloads in Hybrid Manager.

## PGAA and PGFS in Hybrid Manager

### PGAA (Analytics Accelerator)

PGAA extensions provide:

- Vectorized query execution
- Integration with object storage via PGFS
- Support for querying Iceberg and Delta Lake tables
- Catalog integration

PGAA powers both Lakehouse Clusters and PGD offload pipelines.

---

### PGFS (Postgres File System)

PGFS defines object storage locations:

- Used by PGAA to read/write data in object storage
- Supports S3-compatible storage, GCS, and others
- Configured in both PGD clusters and Lakehouse Clusters

PGFS is a simple but critical building block for data lake integration.

## How these concepts fit together in Hybrid Manager

| Layer              | Role |
|--------------------|------|
| PGD Clusters       | Transactional layer, source for Tiered Tables |
| Lakehouse Clusters | Analytical compute, queries across Iceberg/Delta and Postgres |
| Object Storage     | Cost-efficient analytical data storage |
| Catalog Services   | Centralized metadata for Iceberg tables |
| PGAA + PGFS        | Bridge between Postgres and object storage |
