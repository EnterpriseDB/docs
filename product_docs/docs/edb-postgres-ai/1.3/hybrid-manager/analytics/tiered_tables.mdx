description: Learn how Hybrid Manager implements and manages Tiered Tables with PGD and Lakehouse for cost-efficient, scalable analytics.

Tiered Tables in Hybrid Manager (HM) provide an automated solution for managing large time-series or historical datasets by moving older data from PGD clusters to cost-effective object storage in Apache Iceberg format.

Hybrid Manager integrates this capability across:

- PGD clusters with BDR AutoPartition
- PGAA extensions for offloading
- Lakehouse Clusters for querying
- Centralized catalog services (Lakekeeper or external Iceberg catalogs)

For a conceptual overview of Tiered Tables, see [Understanding Tiered Tables with EDB Postgres](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/analytics/tiered_tables).

## Why use Tiered Tables with Hybrid Manager

- **Lower storage costs:** Offload "cold" data to object storage (Iceberg) and shrink primary PGD transactional tables.
- **Faster transactional performance:** Keep "hot" data partitions small for efficient PGD operations.
- **Automated lifecycle management:** Move data across tiers automatically based on age.
- **Transparent analytics:** Query both hot and cold data via PGD parent table or Lakehouse Cluster.
- **Unified management:** Configure and monitor all components through Hybrid Manager.

## Key terms and architecture overview

For definitions of analytics terms used in Hybrid Manager—such as PGFS, PGAA, Analytics Offload, and Lakehouse—see [Analytics concepts (hub)](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/analytics/analytics-concepts).

## When should I use Tiered Tables in Hybrid Manager?

Use Tiered Tables in Hybrid Manager when you want to:

- **Manage large time-series datasets** in a cost-efficient way.
- **Keep PGD operational tables lean** for better performance.
- **Meet compliance needs** by keeping older data available but outside of PGD storage.
- **Enable BI users to run historical trend queries** without impacting production databases.
- **Automate your data lifecycle** with minimal manual intervention.

## Use cases for Tiered Tables

- **Time-series data:** Logging, IoT sensor readings, application telemetry.
- **Archival:** Long-term retention of cold data for compliance.
- **Historical trend analysis:** BI tools querying years of data without impacting PGD performance.
- **Large, append-mostly tables:** Keep transactional footprint small while retaining full analytical access.

## How Tiered Tables work in your HM architecture

- **PGD clusters:** Manage partitioning and automatic offload of old partitions to Iceberg.
- **PGFS storage locations:** Define object storage targets for offload.
- **Iceberg catalogs:** Optionally manage offloaded tables in a catalog (Lakekeeper or external).
- **Lakehouse Clusters:** Provide scalable analytical compute to query offloaded Iceberg data.
- **Monitoring:** Use HM monitoring tools and observability queries to track offload status and storage savings.

## Prerequisites within EDB Hybrid Manager

Before implementing Tiered Tables in HM:

- **Active Hybrid Manager instance**
- **Provisioned PGD cluster:** Version 6.0+ with PGAA and PGFS extensions enabled
- **Lakehouse Cluster (recommended):** For querying offloaded data
- **Catalog service:** Optional, but recommended — HM-managed Lakekeeper or external REST-compatible catalog
- **Machine user for catalog (if using catalog):** With appropriate catalog data writer/reader permissions
- **Object storage:** S3-compatible, with credentials if private
- **User permissions:** Database user must have create/alter/execute privileges for BDR and PGAA functions

## Main capabilities

- **Automated partitioning:** Define BDR AutoPartition strategy and `analytics_offload_period`.
- **Storage tiering:** Use PGFS or Iceberg catalog targets for offloaded data.
- **Query transparently:** PGD parent table queries can hit both local and Iceberg tiers. Lakehouse Clusters can query Iceberg tables directly.
- **Monitor status:** Track offload progress, validate Iceberg content, and observe space savings.

## Getting started with Tiered Tables in Hybrid Manager

To begin using Tiered Tables with Hybrid Manager:

1. [Configure PGFS](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/pgfs/) for object storage access.
2. Learn [Tiered Tables concepts](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/analytics/tiered_tables) and apply policies (AutoPartition, offload period) in PGD.
3. (Optional) Use a catalog (Lakekeeper or external) when interoperability across engines is needed.
4. Query offloaded Iceberg data via Lakehouse clusters.

## Observability tips

- Use HM dashboards for PGD cluster health and offload progress.
- Run analytics queries on `bdr.analytics_table` and partition views.
- Use `pg_total_relation_size()` to observe space reclaimed on PGD nodes.
- Use cloud storage console or analytics to track Iceberg object size growth.
