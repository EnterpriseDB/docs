Hybrid Manager (HM) integrates Delta Lake capabilities into EDB Postgres deployments, enabling Lakehouse clusters to query Delta Lake tables stored in object storage.

## Why use Delta Lake with Hybrid Manager

- **Query existing Delta Lakes:** Leverage data lakes already built on Delta Lake format with fast Postgres SQL.
- **Simplify analytics pipelines:** Avoid unnecessary ETL—query Delta Lake tables in place from Postgres.
- **Broader ecosystem integration:** Connect HM-managed Postgres to Delta Lake data produced by Spark, Trino, Flink, and other tools.
- **Cost-effective lakehouse architecture:** Store large datasets in object storage and query via Lakehouse clusters.

## Key terms and architecture overview

## When should I use Delta Lake in Hybrid Manager?

Use Delta Lake with Hybrid Manager when you want to:

- **Query existing data lakes** built on Delta Lake format, without ETL or data duplication.
- **Integrate Postgres and data lake ecosystems**—query Delta Lake tables from Postgres SQL clients.
- **Enable unified analytics** across operational Postgres data and data lake data.
- **Support BI tools and ad-hoc queries** on Delta Lake content using familiar Postgres tools.
- **Leverage Lakehouse Clusters** for scalable, fast SQL on large Delta datasets.

**Important:** PGAA currently supports **read-only queries** on Delta Lake tables. Writing or updating Delta tables via PGAA is not supported.

## Key capabilities of Delta Lake in Hybrid Manager

### Querying existing Delta Lake tables

**What:** Run SQL queries on Delta Lake tables stored in object storage.

**Why:** Enable BI tools and Postgres users to query existing Delta Lake data without duplicating or moving it.

**How:** Define PGFS storage locations and PGAA external tables in Lakehouse clusters.

**Where:** S3-compatible object storage with Delta Lake format (`_delta_log` + Parquet files).

### Simplifying Postgres + Delta Lake integration

**What:** Connect HM Lakehouse clusters to Delta Lake tables created by Spark or other tools.

**Why:** Build unified reporting and analytics across your operational and data lake systems.

**How:** Create PGFS storage locations and PGAA reader tables pointing to Delta Lake paths.

**Where:** Shared object storage locations used by Delta Lake pipelines.

### Supporting unified SQL-based analytics

**What:** Enable Postgres SQL queries over both operational data and Delta Lake data.

**Why:** Empower application developers, data scientists, and BI users to query data lake content without complex tooling.

**How:** Use PGAA reader tables in Lakehouse clusters; optionally join with Postgres data.

**Where:** Delta Lake tables in object storage + Postgres tables in Lakehouse cluster or via FDW/dblink.

## Getting started with Delta Lake in Hybrid Manager

To begin using Delta Lake with Hybrid Manager:

1. Provision a Lakehouse cluster.
2. [Configure PGFS](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/pgfs/) pointing to your Delta Lake object storage.
3. Enable the `pgaa` extension on the Lakehouse Cluster.
4. Create PGAA reader tables for Delta Lake paths.
5. Query Delta Lake tables using standard Postgres clients.
