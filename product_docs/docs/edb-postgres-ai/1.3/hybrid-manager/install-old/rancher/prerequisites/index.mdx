There are prerequisites to meet before you can install Hybrid Manager (HM) on Rancher.

Fulfill the prerequisites to ensure that you have everything you need before you start the installation process.

## Prerequisites

-   A system from which you can run the installation process with the following utilities:
    -   [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) to manage your Kubernetes cluster
    -   [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to render and apply the Kubernetes manifest.
    -   [edbctl](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/edbctl/)
-   [A RKE2 cluster preconfigured for use with HM](rke2cluster.mdx)
-   [Sync container images to your registry](../../image-sync.mdx)

## Next steps

Once you have fulfilled these requirements, you can move on to [the installation phase](../installing).
