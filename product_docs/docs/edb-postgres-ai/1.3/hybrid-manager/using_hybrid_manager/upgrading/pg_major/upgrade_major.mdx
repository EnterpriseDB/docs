description: Learn how to perform a major version upgrade on a single-node or high-availability cluster in Hybrid Manager.

---

## Prerequisites

* Have a cluster created with Hybrid Manager (HM) up and in a healthy state. To ensure the cluster is in a healthy state, from the cluster's main page, select the **Monitoring** tab.
Check the cluster and database metrics. Make sure everything is operating and all metrics are within the defined acceptable parameters.

* We strongly recommend that you perform a full backup of your cluster and validate a comprehensive recovery plan before proceeding. 

## Upgrade the Postgres major version of an existing cluster created with HM

1.  From the cluster's main page, select **Quick Actions > Upgrade Cluster**. Then choose **Major Upgrade**.

1.  Select your preferred new major version image.

1.  Review the upgrade path. Select **Continue**.

1.  Review the specific package changes expected with the upgrade. If everything looks correct, select **Upgrade Cluster**.

1.  Use the **Monitoring** and **Logs** tabs to monitor the process and troubleshoot any unexpected behavior.

!!! Note

    On rare occasions, additional steps might be recommended after the major upgrade is completed for certain product releases. 
    Consult the release notes to see if this is necessary in your case.
