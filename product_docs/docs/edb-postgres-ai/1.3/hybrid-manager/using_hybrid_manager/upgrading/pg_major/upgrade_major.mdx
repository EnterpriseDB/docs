description: Learn how to do a major version upgrade on a single node or High Availability cluster on Hybrid Manager.

---

## Prerequisites

* Have a cluster created with HM up and in a healthy state. To ensure the cluster is in a healthy state, from the cluster's main page, select the **Monitoring** tab.
Now check the cluster and database metrics and make sure everything is operating and all metrics are within the defined acceptable parameters.

* It is strongly recommended to perform a full backup of your cluster and validate a comprehensive recovery plan before proceeding. 

## Upgrade the PG major version of an existing cluster created with HM

1.  First, from the cluster's main page, select **Quick Action>Upgrade Cluster** and then choose **Major Upgrade**.

1.  The **Upgrade Cluster &mdash; Major** dialogue window opens.

1.  Select your preferred new major version image.

!!! Note

    If you **do not** have a dedicated registry setup and is relying directly on EDB production registry, you may run into issues where the system allows you to setup the cluster with operands incompatible with the installed version Hybrid Manager.  In this case, you need to pay attenion to the meta data displayed while selecting an image to ensure it's compatible.  <Add a screen shot and detailed explanation>.  To counter this issue, EDB recommends setting up a customer dedidated registry as described [here](../../../system/synced-images.mdx)

1.  Review the upgrade path and confirm by selecting the **Continue** button.

1. The dialogue window now shows the specific package changes to be expected with the upgrade.
   Review these and select **Upgrade Cluster** if everything looks as correct.

1.  The upgrade is applied automatically. 
    You can then use the **Monitoring**, and **Logs** tabs to monitor the process and/or troubleshoot any unexpected behavior.

!!! Note

    On rare occasions, additional steps might be recommended after the major upgrade is completed for certain product release. 
    Consult the Release notes for the product in question to see if this is necessary in your case.
