description: Learn how to perform a Postgres minor version upgrade in Hybrid Manager.

---

Minor version upgrades use the same procedure for all cluster types and Postgres database types, including community PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Extended Server, and EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

Minor version releases include bug fixes, security patches, and backward-compatible improvements.
These are typically issued at least once every three months. 

Minor releases of Postgres don't introduce new features or breaking changes, so we recommend that you adopt them as soon as they're released.
Even if your Postgres cluster is running multiple minor versions behind, we recommend adopting the latest minor version available.

You have full control over when new versions become available in Hybrid Manager (HM).
Once validated and published, new version images are available in HM's image library and are available for upgrades on any existing cluster.

!!! Note

    Postgres minor version upgrades require a data restart. Expect minimal downtime.

Although minor upgrades are ideally frequent and low risk, best practice is to always have up-to-date backups and a recovery plan in place before proceeding with the upgrade.

The prerequisites to get started are to have a cluster created with HM up and in a healthy state.

To ensure the cluster is in a healthy state, from the cluster's main page, select the **Monitoring** tab.
Check the cluster and database metrics. Make sure everything is operating and all metrics are within the defined acceptable parameters.

## Upgrade the Postgres minor version of an existing instance/cluster created with HM

1.  From the cluster's main page, select **Quick Action > Upgrade Cluster**. Then select **Minor Upgrade**.

1.  Select your preferred new minor version image.

1.  Review the upgrade path. To confirm, select **Continue**.

1.  Review the specific package changes expected with the upgrade. If everything looks correct, select **Upgrade Cluster**.

    Use the **Monitoring** and **Logs** tabs to monitor the process and troubleshoot any unexpected behavior.

!!! Note

    On rare occasions, additional steps might be recommended after the minor upgrade is completed for certain product release. 
    Consult the release notes to see if this is necessary in your case.

## Rollback considerations

With this approach, no automatic rollback is available, and we don't recommend performing a downgrade. 
To undo the minor upgrade, restore from the latest backup in a new cluster running the preferred minor version and switch application workloads over to the new cluster.
You can then delete the Postgres minor upgraded cluster or troubleshoot it further.
