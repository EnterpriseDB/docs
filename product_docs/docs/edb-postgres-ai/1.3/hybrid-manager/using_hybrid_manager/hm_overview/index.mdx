## What is Hybrid Manager Console?

Hybrid Manager (HM) Console is a user interface for provisioning and managing Postgres clusters. It's a centralized location for viewing, monitoring, and managing the lifecycle of databases.

In this console, you organize your resources in *projects*. A project associates organizationally related resources together, which enables simpler administration and access.

## What can you do in Hybrid Manager Console?

Using the console, you can:

-   Create, view, and manage Postgres clusters
-   Create, view, and manage projects
-   Create Migration Portal projects and perform migrations
-   Monitor database migrations
-   Create, view, and manage Lakehouse clusters
-   View and manage catalogs
-   View the status of model clusters
-   Manage your asset library
-   Monitor HM-managed and external clusters

## Hybrid Manager Console organization

The console is organized around three main pages that you access by selecting the page names that appear on every page in HM:

- [**Projects**](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/projects), where you create and manage projects, create and manage clusters, and perform a variety of tasks to manage your cluster and each project.
- [**Estate**](using-portal.md/#monitoring-resources-in-your-estate), where you monitor your resources. You can also use it as a starting point for creating clusters.
- [**Asset Library**](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/image-management/asset-library), where you can view container images and knowledge bases and manage repositories.

## Launching third-party services

You can use HM [Launchpad](using-portal.md/#launchpad) to launch related third-party services without leaving the HM portal.
