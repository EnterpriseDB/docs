description: Use the edbctl utility to manage cluster templates for a Hybrid Manager cluster.
---

The `edbctl cluster-template` command group provides the necessary tools to manage pre-defined cluster templates. These templates serve as blueprints, allowing you to standardize configurations and rapidly deploy database clusters with consistent settings across the environment.

## Commands

- [edbctl cluster-template create]() &mdash; Used to define and register a new database cluster template.

- [edbctl cluster-template list]() &mdash; Used to view al available cluster templates within your project or estate.

### edbctl cluster-template create

The `edbctl cluster-template create` command allows you to define and save a database cluster configuration as a reusable template. By providing a YAML configuration file, you can standardize complex architectures—including Single, HA, PGD, and Analytics clusters—ensuring consistent deployments across your organization.

Use this command to register a new template by pointing to a local YAML file that specifies the cluster's technical requirements (CPU, memory, storage, backups, and Postgres configurations).

```
edbctl cluster-template create [options]
```

Where `options` are:

```
  -F, --config-file string        Path to the cluster configuration YAML file (required). For more details, see [configuration file structure](#configuration-file-structure).
  -n, --name string               Name of the cluster template (required).
  -d, --description string        A bried summary of the template's purpose or configuration.
  -P, --project string            The project context. Defaults to `context_project`.
  -c, --credential string         The name of the credential to use for authentication (required). The default is taken from the current configuration context.
  -y, --yes                       Auto-confirms all prompts and confirmations, enabling non-interactive operation.
  -h, --help                      Displays help information for the create command.
```

#### Configuration file structure

The configuration file supports several cluster types. Below are the core parameters for each type:

**Cluster types and architectures**

- **Single** &mdash; A single-node database cluster.
- **HA** &mdash; A high-availability cluster with standby replicas.
- **PGD** &mdash; EDB Postgres Distributed cluster for multi-master or multi-region setups.
- **Analytics** &mdash; A cluster optimized for analytics workloads.

**Key configuration parameters**

- `clusterType` &mdash; Specifies the type of cluster - `Single`, `HA`, `PGD`, or `Analytics` (required).
- `instanceSize` &mdash; CPU Cores (0.1-15) and Memory in Gi (0.1-10)(required).
- `storage` &mdash; Database storage size and `storageClass` like `ssd-csi` (required).
- `backupSchedule` &mdash; A cron expression for automated backups (required).
- `imageId` &mdash; The image UUID for the database cluster.
- `postgresqlConfiguration` &mdash; Key-value pairs for `postgresql.conf`.

### edbctl cluster-template list

The `edbctl cluster-template` list command provides a way to view and inspect your saved database cluster blueprints. You can use this command for high-level discovery of available templates, deep inspection of a template's specifications, or to export a template's configuration back into YAML format.

```
edbctl cluster-template list [--id [--config-yaml]] [options]
```

Where `options` are:

```
-i, --id		string	The unique ID of the cluster template to inspect.
-n, --name		string	Filter the list by a specific template name.
-y, --config-yaml	    (Used with --id) Prints the template’s configuration in a raw YAML format.
-o, --output	string	Format options: table (default), json, yaml, xml, json-raw.
-P, --project	-P	string	The project context. Defaults to context_project.
--credential	-c	string	Authentication credential name. Defaults to context_credential.
--help	-h		Displays help for the list command.
```

This example shows how to list all cluster templates in the current project context:

```
# List all templates:
edbctl cluster-template list

# List templates filtered by name:
edbctl cluster-template list --name "prod-standard"

# List templates using ID:
edbctl cluster-template list --id "p-c5fh47nfjcg4ci71uv32"

# Export the list of templates in YAML format:
edbctl cluster-template list --id "p-c5fh47nfjcg4ci71uv32" --config-yaml
```
