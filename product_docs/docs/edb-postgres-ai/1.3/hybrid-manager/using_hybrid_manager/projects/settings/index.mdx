You can configure project-specific settings like notifications, security, and alerts. Use the **Settings** menu to access these settings.

-   Select **Profile** to change your project's name at any time. Project names must be unique in a Hybrid Manager (HM) instance.

-   Select [**Notifications**](notifications.mdx) to configure how the project’s notifications are sent.

-   Select **Security** to add externally managed keys for transparent data encryption (TDE) to a project. You can use these keys later during cluster creation to add data encryption. See [Enabling key management systems for TDE](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/install/configuration/kms_for_tde/) for KMS-specific instructions.

-   Select [**Alerts**](alerts.mdx) to see the alert settings of the project and control how and when alerts are sent.
