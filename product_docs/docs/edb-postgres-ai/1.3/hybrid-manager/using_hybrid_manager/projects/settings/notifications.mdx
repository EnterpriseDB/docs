description: Learn how to customize the types of notifications and channels, such as email, webhook, and pager duty, with Hybrid Manager.
---

With Hybrid Manager (HM), you can customize the types of notifications you want to receive. There are two types of notification channels:

- **User notifications** &mdash; You can receive notifications via email, in-app inbox, or both. These notifications are for all users who have enabled them if their role allows it.

- **System notifications**  &mdash; You can receive notifications via email (mail group), webhook, pager duty, or any combination. These notifications are triggered once per event, primarily to automate tasks in your organization.

Your role in HM determines your access to notification preferences. The following types of notifications are available:

- Account &mdash; For user notification channels. You can be notified that:
    - A new project role was assigned to you.
    - A project role was unassigned from you.
    - Your personal access key is about to expire.
- Global &mdash; For user and system notification channels (visible only to the organization owner). You can be notified that:
    - A new project was created.
    - The machine access key is about to expire.
- Projects &mdash; For user and system notification channels. You can be notified that:
    - The active cluster was paused.
    - A paused cluster was reactivated.

## Configuring notifications

Project owners/editors and organization owners/admins can enable or disable notifications for the events they can see. They can receive notifications in the in-app inbox, by email, or both.

Notification settings made by a user apply only to that user. If an email notification is enabled, the email is sent to the email address associated with the user's login.

System notification channels can be configured at the global level by the organization owner or at the project level by the project owner. By default, each organization's project inherits the global-level system notifications channel. However, you can enable/disable or reconfigure the system notifications channel at the project level to override the default settings.

### Configure notifications at the global level

Only the organization owner can set the global notifications.

For webhook:

1. From your profile menu, select **Settings**.
1. Select the **Notifications** tab.
1. Select **Webhook** and enter:

    - The host URL of the webhook
    - The method of the webhook - POST or PUT

1. Optionally, provide one of these authentication parameters:

    - For Basic Auth: username and password
    - Bearer Token

1. Select **Save**.

For PagerDuty:

Before configuring the PagerDuty notification channel:

- You need access to a PagerDuty account with elevated privileges.
- PagerDuty service must be created and configured with Events API v2 integration.
- In your PagerDuty account, navigate to the desired service and access its **Integrations** settings.
- Add and configure a new Events API v2 integration.
- Copy the Integration Key (routing key) provided by PagerDuty for the newly created integration.

To configure the PagerDuty notification channel:

1. From your profile menu, select **Settings**.
1. Select the **Notifications** tab.
1. Select **PagerDuty**.
1. Set the Routing Key (integration key).
1. Select **Save**.
                
For email:

      - Email To - Optionally, for the system email notifications (Email group)
      - Email From - for the email which is sending the email
      - Host - URL of the email service
      - Port - port of the email service
      - Username - username of the email service
      - Password - of the email service

### Configure notification at project level

Project-level notification settings can override global settings. Each project can have its unique configuration.

1. Select the **Projects** tab
1. Select any project.
1. Go to the Project Overview page.
1. Select **Settings** on the left-side menu.
1. Select **Notifications**.
1. Follow the steps under [Configure notifications at the global level](#configure-notifications-at-the-global-level) for each system notification channel.

### Viewing notifications

Users in the following roles can view the notifications:

- Organization owners can view the global notifications.
- Project owners/editors can view the project notifications.
- All users can view their account notifications.

Each notification indicates the level and project the user belongs to with multiple roles assigned in HM.

To view the email notifications, check the inbox of your configured email address.
