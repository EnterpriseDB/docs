## Upgrade from 1.2.3 → 1.3.0

This release introduces major changes to the underlying storage for monitoring (Thanos) and adds the Spire identity service.

### Perform system level changes (EKS Only)

If you are running on **Amazon EKS**, you must update your IAM roles to allow NIM models to access S3.

* **Action:** Edit the IAM role associated with your Service Account.
* **Update:** Add the condition `"system:serviceaccount:m-*:m-*"` to the trust relationship policy.

### Update your `values.yaml`

Modify your configuration file to accommodate new parameters.

1. **Update image tags.**

   ```yaml
   bootstrapImageTag: v1.3.0
   ```

1. **Increase storage for monitoring.**

   The Thanos Compactor requires more storage in this release.

   ```yaml
   parameters:
     upm-thanos:
       compactor_pvc_storage: 100Gi
   ```

1. **Set new mandatory defaults.**

   The following values can no longer be empty and must be defined:

   ```yaml
   parameters:
     upm-beaco-ff-base:
       aes_key_rotation_interval: "24h" # Example value
     upm-istio-gateway:
       enable_server_session: true
       session_duration_seconds: 3600 # Example value
   ```

1. **Configure Spire trust domain.**

   Spire is now included in the platform. You must set a unique trust domain for this installation.

   ```yaml
   parameters:
     global:
       trust_domain: <your-unique-trust-domain>
   ```

### Perform the upgrade

```bash
helm repo update

helm upgrade --install edbpgai-bootstrap enterprisedb-edbpgai/edbpgai-bootstrap \
   -n edbpgai-bootstrap \
   -f ./values.yaml \
   --version 1.3.0
```

### Post-upgrade expectations

* **Portal downtime:** The internal beacon database may take up to **30 minutes** to come online. The portal may be unavailable during this time.

* **Database restarts:** All customer databases will restart during this upgrade as they migrate from `barman-cloud` in-tree to the plugin architecture.

* **Model hosting:** Models previously created via `kubectl` must be re-installed using the UI.

* **Migration Portal:** Databases created prior to 1.3.0 cannot be used as destination targets for migration.
