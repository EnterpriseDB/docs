Hybrid Manager (HM) offers two distinct release streams: **LTS (Long-Term Support)** and **Innovation Releases (IR)**. Because these streams follow different versioning logic, the supported paths for moving between them depend on your current version and the target environment.

## Supported LTS upgrade paths

LTS releases follow standard semantic versioning (e.g., **1.3.x**). These versions focus on stability and are intended for production environments requiring a long support lifecycle.

### Minor version upgrades

You can upgrade from one minor version to the immediate next minor version. You must ensure you are on the **latest patch version** of your current minor release before moving forward.

**Supported:** `1.3.x` to `1.4.y`

**Not Supported:** `1.3.x` to `1.5.y` (You must upgrade to `1.4.y` first)

### Major version upgrades

When a new major version (e.g., **2.0**) is released, you must be running the latest available `1.x` minor release to perform the upgrade.

## Supported IR upgrade paths

Innovation Releases follow a date-based versioning scheme (e.g., **2025.11**). These releases provide the latest features and platform hardening at a faster cadence.

### Sequential Upgrades

Innovation Releases require a **strict sequential upgrade pattern**. You cannot skip a monthly release.

**Supported:** `2025.11` to `2025.12`

**Not Supported:** `2025.11` to `2026.01` (You must upgrade to `2025.12` first)

## Supported cross-stream upgrade paths

Moving between LTS and Innovation Releases is possible, but subject to specific constraints regarding version numbering and platform limitations.

### LTS to Innovation Release

You can upgrade an LTS release to its immediate succeeding Innovation Release.

!!!Warning
Once you move from an LTS release to an Innovation Release, you cannot move back to an LTS release until the next consolidation point (see IR to LTS below).
!!!

### Innovation Release to LTS

You can move from the **final Innovation Release** of a cycle to the **LTS release** that consolidates those features, but you can't move to an LTS release from any other Innovation Release.

!!!Warning Warning for OpenShift users
Due to the OpenShift Operator Lifecycle Manager (OLM) enforcing strict semantic versioning, date-based versions (like `2026.1`) are interpreted as being significantly "higher" than standard versions (like `1.4`). This can prevent the OLM from recognizing a move to an LTS version as an upgrade.
!!!

We are currently decoupling the Operator versions from the HM application versions to resolve this.
