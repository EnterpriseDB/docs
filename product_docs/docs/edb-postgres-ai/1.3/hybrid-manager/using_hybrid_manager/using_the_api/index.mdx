System administrators and developers can use the EDB Postgres AI Hybrid Manager (HM) API to integrate directly with HM for management tasks. These tasks involve managing clusters - (provisioning, deprovisioning, and scaling), automating administrative operations, and handling migrations.

For more information, see API docs from the EDB Postgres AI Portal:

1. Go to your Hybrid Manager console URL and log in with your credentials.
2. Look for an `API` link at the bottom of the page.
3. Select the `API` link to open the interactive API explorer. 

You can view all available endpoints, see required parameters, and even execute sample requests directly from your browser.

## Access Key

An access key provides secure, programmatic access to the HM API. It enables users to authenticate and interact with HM services without requiring interactive login each time.

Key purposes:

-   Authentication — Verifies the identity of the user or system calling the API.

-   Automation — Allows scripts, tools, or applications to securely perform tasks such as provisioning clusters, scaling, or monitoring—without manual intervention.

-   Access control — Ties actions to a specific user or machine, enabling audit trails and permission enforcement.

-   Security — Avoids the need to embed usernames and passwords in automation scripts.
