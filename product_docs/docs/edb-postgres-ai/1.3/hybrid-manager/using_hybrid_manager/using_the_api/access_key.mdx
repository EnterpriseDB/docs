description: Learn how to create and use an API access key with Hybrid Manager.
---

An access key provides authentication for users to interact directly with the Hybrid Manager (HM) API. Each access key is linked to a single user and is immutable after creation.

You can create an access key for a machine user or a normal user. The organization owner can manage the access key for a machine user. Normal users can manage their own access keys.

Each key must have an expiration period between 1 and 365 days, set at creation time. Once an access key expires, or if it's lost, then you must delete it and create a new one.

| User type    | Quota - max keys | Keys created and managed                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Machine user | 2                | Two access keys, created while [creating a machine user](../../using_hybrid_manager/monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/create_machine_user.mdx). Optionally, can be individually added from the **Access keys** tab on the machine user's details page using the **Create New Key** option. |
| Normal user  | 1                | One access key, [created](access_key.mdx) and managed by the user from their home page.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

An access key can be revoked from a user. Revoking the key doesn't affect the role or any other authentication process of the linked user.

## Create your personal access key

1.  Log in to the HM console.
1.  From the menu next to your organization name at the top right, select **My Account**.
1.  From the **My Account** page, select the **Access Keys** tab.
1.  On the **Access Keys** tab, select **Create New Key**.
1.  Enter a value for **Access Key Name**.
1.  Enter a value for **Expiry days** in the range of 1 to 365.
1.  Select **Create Key**.

The generated access key is provided to the user.

Copy this access key and save it in a secure location. The access key is available only when you create it. If you lose your access key, you must delete it and create a new one.

You can enable in-app inbox or email notifications so that you're alerted when your personal key is about to expire. For more information, see [Managing notifications](../monitoring/notifications.mdx).

## Manage access key

You can manage the access keys for a machine user on the **Users** page.

To view the details of an access key:

1.  From the menu next to your organization name at the top right, select **User Management**.
1.  Select **Edit** next to the user whose access key details you want to view.
1.  View the **Access Keys** tab on the user's page. Each row provides the access key details:
    -  **Name** — Access key name.
    -  **Access Key** — Access key in half encrypted format.
    -  **Expiry at** — The expiry date for the access key.
    -  **Created at** — The creation date for the access key.

To delete a key, select **Delete** next to the key. You're prompted to confirm the deletion.

To create a key, select **Create New Key** at the top right of the **Access Keys** tab.

## Use the access key

The HM API detects if the caller is using an access key in the request. If the caller uses the access key, the API checks:

-   The validity of the access key.
-   The organization of the user requesting access.
-   The user permissions.

It then authorizes the access. For more information, see [Using the access key](using_access_key.mdx).
