description: Learn about managing backups for a Hybrid Manager cluster.
---

The Backups tab under a specific cluster in Hybrid Manager provides a centralized view and control panel for managing the backups of that PostgreSQL cluster. This page helps users track, validate, and manage the backup lifecycle efficiently and securely.

## Purpose

Backups tab is designed to provide visibility into all backup activities associated with the selected cluster. It supports both monitoring past backups and initiating new ones. It is especially useful for operations and site reliability engineers (SRE) teams to ensure data protection and facilitate recovery processes when needed.

## Key features

- **Monitor backup status**

  Easily check whether backups were successfully completed or failed, along with timestamps and durations.

- **Initiate manual backups**
  
  Use the Create Backup button to trigger an immediate backup of the cluster.

- **Review backup metadata**

  Get detailed insights such as start and stop time, method of backup (e.g., VolumeSnapshot), and the storage location used.

- **Restore from backups**

  Use the restore icon (‚Ü©Ô∏è) to initiate recovery from a specific backup point.

- **Copy backupID**

  Use the copy icon (üìã) to copy the backup identifier for referencing in automation, support cases, or logs.

- **Delete backups**

  Use the delete icon (üóëÔ∏è) to delete the backup manually which are no longer required.


The backups tab provides detailed information of backup jobs with the following columns:

| Column                 | Description                                                                                   |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Status                 | Indicates whether the backup completed successfully (Completed), failed, or is still running. |
| Name                   | System-generated name of the backup job.                                                      |
| Start Time / Stop Time | Timestamps showing when the backup started and ended.                                         |
| Duration               | How long the backup took to complete.                                                         |
| Location               | The storage destination for the backup (e.g., managed-devspatcher).                           |
| Method                 | The technology used to take the backup (e.g., VolumeSnapshot).                                |

## Usability

Use this tab when you need to:

- Verifying successful completion of automated or scheduled backups

- Performing a backup prior to a major upgrade or maintenance task

- Restoring the database to a previous known-good state

- Auditing historical backup activity
