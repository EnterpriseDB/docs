## Recommendations

The **Recommendations** tab shows a scorecard and a list of recommendations that can help to improve the Postgres cluster performance.

The scorecard and recommendation are directly related. A cluster scores lower than Excellent only if any recommendations appear.
After you apply or dismiss the recommendations, the score shows Excellent.

### Scorecard

In the scorecard, a score is assigned to a given cluster for each grading category:
- Indexes
- Statistics
- Configuration
- Security
- Workload

!!! Note
    Only the first Indexes and Statistics are currently available.

Generally, grades are assigned on an A-F scale.

For the Indexes category, the possible grades are:
- Excellent (A) if no recommendations were generated to tune indexes
- Good (B), Fair (C), and Poor (D), depending on how many recommendations were generated

These scores are computed by considering only primary nodes in the case of PSR and write leaders in the case of PGD/AHA. Furthermore, the score is related to the database in the PG cluster that's performing the worst, not an average over all databases created in such a cluster. 

For the Statistics category, the possible grades are:
- Excellent (A) if no recommendations were generated to add statistics
- Good (B) if at least one recommendation was generated

!!! Note
    - Fail (F) isn't currently used. It's reserved for unhealthy cluster states that require immediate action.
    - Unknown (U) means information needed to evaluate a cluster is unavailable.

When you select a category, the displayed text helps you to understand the relevance of the recommendations in addition to providing context on how the score was computed.

A radar chart shows the global score of the cluster across all categories.

### Recommendations list

Below the scorecard, a list of recommendations is displayed, depending on the category selected in the scorecard:

- Status: Status of a recommendation (New, Ignored, Applied).
- Database Name.
- Node ID.
- Size Increase (for indexes): Estimated index size.
- Absolute Benefit (for indexes): Absolute cost reduction that applying this index can produce.
- Total Cost (for indexes): Execution time plus plan time for running this query.
- Cost Reduction (for indexes): Estimated percentage cost reduction computed as (abs_benefit/total_cost) * 100, which is relative to all the workloads executed in a database.
- Weight (for statistics): Rough estimation of the potential benefit of applying the statistics.
- Recommended Time: Creation time for this recommendation.
- Query: Text of the query to create an index or a statistic.

Use the cog icon to show/hide columns.  

CTA buttons in each row let you:
- Mark the recommendation as completed
- Ignore the recommendation
- Copy the text of the recommendation

!!!Note
You can't apply recommendations from the web interface. You must manually copy and execute them in the terminal or an admin UI.
!!!

Use the filters to restrict data by database, node, or status.

### Understanding recommendations

#### Mark the recommendation as applied/ignored

Use the **applied** option to tell Hybrid Manager (HM) that you applied the recommended change.
If you mark a recommendation as applied, it disappears from the list. When the page is next reloaded, the score increases to reflect the change.
If the same recommendation appears again, this means the change was not applied or it was undone. The score will drop again.

Use the **ignored** option to tell HM that you reviewed the recommended change and decided not to apply it.
If you mark a recommendation as ignored, it disappears from the list. When the page is next reloaded, the score increases.
If the same recommendation is received again, it's ignored and doesn't reappear.

#### Where does this data come from?

The Index and Statistics recommendations are sourced from the Query Advisor extension. Make sure this extension is enabled in the monitored database.

In future releases, recommendations will be generated from other data sources, including historical metrics and Query Diagnostics.
