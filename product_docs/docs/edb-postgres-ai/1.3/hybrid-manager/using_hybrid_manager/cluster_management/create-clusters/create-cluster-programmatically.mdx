By automating Postgres cluster creation you can streamline reproducible builds.

Use Bash scripts and the Hybrid Manager API to automate Postgres cluster creation for reproducible builds. Check all configurations into source control to track changes and maintain documentation.

## Create a machine user

1. Go to the dropdown menu in the upper-right corner of the HM console.
2. Select **User management** from the dropdown menu.
3. Select **Add new user** in the upper-right corner.
4. In the pop-up window that shows **Add new user**, enter the name and tick off the checkbox **Create access key**.
6. Fill in the field **Expires in**.
7. In the pop-up window, select **Add user**.
8. Copy the access key from the pop-up window.
9. Select **Key stored safely**.

## Give the machine user permissions

!!! note
To set the machine user permissions correctly, select the target project you want to create the Postgres clusters in from the left navigation bar.
!!!

1. In the upper-left corner, select **Projects** and navigate to your project.
2. In the left navigation bar, select **Users**.
3. In the search bar, look for the machine user you created.
4. Select the pencil (edit) icon on the right-hand side of **Machine user**.
5. Select **Assign Roles**.
6. Under **Assign project roles**, tick off the checkbox **Project owner**.
7. Select **Submit**.

## Create an env.sh file

You can simplify wiriting shell scripts by adding the project ID to the `env.sh` file and the API host.

Add the copied access key in a file named `env.sh`:

```
export HCP_ACCESS_KEY="baak_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
export HCP_API_ACCESS_KEY=${HCP_ACCESS_KEY}
export HCP_PROJECT_ID=prj_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
export HCP_API_HOST="https://portal-uat-eks.aws.hcp.enterprisedb.network"
```


## Locate a Docker image with AIDB and PGFS
To get a list of locations and the Docker images available at the locations, create and run the script called `01-get-locations.sh`. You'll see the following content:

```
#!/bin/bash

set -e
set -u
set -o pipefail

# list locations

source env.sh

curl \
  --insecure \
  --header "Content-Type: Application/JSON" \
  --header "x-access-key: ${HCP_API_ACCESS_KEY}" \
  --request GET \
  ${HCP_API_HOST}/api/v1/projects/${HCP_PROJECT_ID}/locations \
  | jq
```


Run the following script:

```
./01-get-locations.sh > locations.json
```


Examine `locations.json` and look for any image listed under `pgExtensions`, `aidb` and `pgfs`.

## Create a Postgres cluster

Create a file named `create-psr-cluster.json` which includes the image names you have retrieved from the previous step:

```
{
  "projectId": "${HCP_PROJECT_ID}",
  "psr": {
    "clusterName": "small-ai-api-001",
    "password": "111111111111",
    "locationId": "managed-devspatcher",
    "clusterData": {
      "instances": 1,
      "resourceRequest": {
        "memory": "2Gi",
        "cpu": "2"
      },
      "storageConfiguration": {
        "primaryStorage": {
          "size": "4",
          "storageClass": "hcp-aws-gp3"
        },
        "walStorage": {
          "size": "4",
          "storageClass": "hcp-aws-gp3"
        }
      },
      "image": {
        "url": "upmdev.azurecr.io/postgresql:17.6-2510160831",
        "digest": "sha256:6bda61e6d75c3b9d6a886c547d789c46b88ed807ae28d8d06fa1510a0cc5afae"
      },
      "networkAccessType": "NetworkAccessTypePublic"
    }
  }
}
```
Write a shell script called `02-create-psr-cluster.sh` to use `create-psr-cluster.json` and create a cluster:

```
#!/bin/bash

set -e
set -o pipefail
set -u

source env.sh

cat create-psr-cluster.json | envsubst > /tmp/create-psr-cluster.json

curl \
  --insecure \
  --header "Content-Type: Application/JSON" \
  --header "x-access-key: ${HCP_API_ACCESS_KEY}" \
  --data-binary "@/tmp/create-psr-cluster.json" \
  --request POST \
  ${HCP_API_HOST}/api/v1/projects/${HCP_PROJECT_ID}/clusters
```

Run the shell script:

```
./02-create-psr-cluster.sh | tee ./psr-cluster.json
```

You can check the progress of the cluster creation in the HM console.

## Create the AIDB and PGFS extensions in the new cluster
You can add the functionality of AIDB and PGFS to your programmatically created clusters as extensions.

### Configure env.sh to include PostgreSQL authentication credentials

Add the following to your `env.sh` file. For example:

```
export PGPASSWORD=your_postgresql_password
export PGUSER=edb_admin
export PGHOST=your-postgresql-hostname
export PGPORT=5432
export PGDATABASE=edb_admin
export PGSSLMODE=require
```

### Create cluster extensions

Create a bash file called `03-create-ai-extensions.sh` with the following content:

```
#!/bin/bash

set -e
set -o pipefail
set -u

source env.sh

psql -X <<EOF
create extension aidb cascade;
create extension pgfs cascade;
EOF

```

Run the script:

```
$ chmod +x 03-create-ai-extensions.sh
$ ./03-create-ai-extensions.sh
```

## Cluster verification

After verifying the cluster creation via the HM console, you can get your new cluster via the API to verify its settings.
Getting clusters in JSON format also helps specifying the required JSON fields and can serve as a blueprint for automated cluster creation, avoiding to look up each setting field individually.

!!! note
 Create-cluster JSON and Get-cluster JSON are two different functionalities that can contain different information.
!!!


Create a file called `get-existing-cluster.sh` that includes the following:

```
#!/bin/bash

set -e
set -u
set -o pipefail

source env.sh

HCP_PG_CLUSTER_ID=p-fj3ki6e0x0

curl \
  --insecure \
  --header "Content-Type: Application/JSON" \
  --header "x-access-key: ${HCP_API_ACCESS_KEY}" \
  --request GET \
  ${HCP_API_HOST}/api/v1/projects/${HCP_PROJECT_ID}/clusters/${HCP_PG_CLUSTER_ID} \
  | jq
```
Where `HCP_PG_CLUSTER_ID` specifies your cluster ID.

Save the content of the cluster into a JSON file:

```
./get-existing-cluster.sh > existing-cluster.json
```
!!! note
Check the [API documentation](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/using_the_api/) for more details on the required fields, the naming convention, and JSON structure for cluster creation.
