While the connection to the underlying repositories is configured by the system administrator, you can manage the repositories that are available in the asset library.

You can achieve this by allowing the system to include repositories and tagged images that match a specific pattern or patterns. Each pattern is defined as a rule. You can then control which repositories are included in the asset library and which images are available for use in your Hybrid Manager clusters.

By default, the asset library includes all the official HM repositories and all the tagged images in those repositories.

For more control over the repositories and images available in the asset library, you can manage your own private repository, which can be hosted on a private registry. This gives you complete control over what the registry contains and allows you to add your own images and manage them. Whichever route you choose, the asset library's repository inclusion rules still operate to control what's available in the asset library.

## Managing repositories

Select **Manage Repositories** in the **Container Images** tab of the asset library. Use the **Manage Repositories** page to add, edit, or delete repository registrations that are available in the asset library. 

A table of the repositories that are currently registered in the Asset Library has the following columns:

-   **Repository Name Regex**: The regular expression that the name of the repository must match.
-   **Number of Rules**: The number of rules that are associated with this repository registration.
-   **Created**: The date and time when the repository registration was created.

When populated, each row includes an **Edit** button to edit the repository registration and a **Delete** button to delete the repository registration.

Use the search field to search for a specific repository registration by name and the sort control to sort the table by the repository name or created date.

In the top-right corner of the screen select **Register New Repository** to to add a repository registration.

## Registering new repository

Select **Register New Repository** to open a dialog box where you can enter the details of the new repository registration:

-   **Repository Name Regex**: A regular expression that matches the name of the repository. This is used to filter which repositories are included in the asset library.

This field must match the name of the repository (or repositories) that you want to include in the asset library. For example, if you want to include all repositories that start with `pgaihm-`, enter `^pgaihm-.*$` as the regular expression. You can enter plain text, but it's treated as a regular expression. We recommend using a regular expression to ensure that the repository name matches the pattern you want.

-   **Rules**: A list of rules that are associated with this repository registration. Each rule consists of a regular expression that matches a tag that's associated with the image. The rules are used to filter which images are included in the asset library. For example if you want to include all images with the tag `latest`, enter `^latest$` as the regular expression. You can enter plain text, but it's treated as a regular expression. We recommend using a regular expression to ensure that the tag exactly matches the pattern you want.

You can add multiple rules by selecting **Add Rule**, which adds a new row to the list of rules. You can delete a rule by selecting **Delete** next to the rule.

Once you have entered the details of the new repository registration, select **Register Repository** to save the registration. The new repository registration is then added to the list of registered repositories and is available in the asset library. This may take a few minutes to complete as the system must scan the repository for images that match the rules you defined.

When the operation is complete, you return to the **Manage Repositories** page, where you can see the new repository registration in the list of registered repositories.

Return to the [asset library](asset-library.mdx) to see the effect of new repository rules and the images that are now available.
