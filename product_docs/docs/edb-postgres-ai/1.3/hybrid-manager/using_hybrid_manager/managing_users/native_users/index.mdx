description: Create and manage additional native users for testing purposes or remove native users after configuring an IdP.
---

For testing or demo environments, you can use native users to simplify operations. 
To manage the lifecycle of native users you can:

- [Change the password of a native user](change_pw_native_user).
- [Create additional native users](create_native_user).

For production deployments, we strongly recommend that you [configure an external IdP](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/install/configuration/byo_idp/). 
After configuring an IdP, you can: 

-   [Disable native user login](disable_native_user).
