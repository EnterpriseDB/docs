navTitle: Creating native users
description: Create additional native users.
---

For testing or demo environments, you can simplify operations by adding native users. For production deployments, we strongly recommend [configuring an external IdP](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/install/customization/byo_idp/).

Currently, you can't create human users with the Hybrid Manager (HM) console. You can do so only by tweaking the HM configuration file.  

## Adding a native user

Append new users to the `portal.authentication.staticPasswords` section during or after installation. Replace this value either in your `values.yaml` file or `HybridControlPlane` custom resource, depending on the installation method you use.

```yaml
portal:
  authentication:
    staticPasswords:
      - email: "owner@mycompany.com"
        hash: "$2y$10$STTzuGJa3PydqHvlzi2z6OgDU1G/JLTqiuGblH.RemIutWxkztN5m"
        username: "owner@mycompany.com"
        userID: "c5998173-a605-449a-a9a5-4a9c33e26df7"
     - email: "<userA@example.com>"          
       hash: "<example_hashed_password>"
       username: "<userA@example.com>"
       userID: "<unique_user_id>"  
```

[Apply the DEX configuration](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/managing_users/apply_dex_config/) to populate the changes.

### Parameters

These settings are for the user in the `portal.authentication.staticPasswords` entry. Each user needs values for `email`, `hash`, `username`, and `userID`.

| Parameter  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `email`    | Email address of the user. Also serves as the user's login identifier for accessing the HM console.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `hash`     | Bcrypt-hashed user password for password store. To generate this value, use `echo ${password} \| htpasswd -BinC 10 userA \| cut -d: -f2`, where the actual password is stored behind the `${password}` variable. `userA` represents the username used during the password hashing process. It can be any arbitrary text, as it's not used elsewhere in the configuration. Only the resulting hash is used. |
| `userID`   | Each new user configured with a static password must have a distinct, unique identifier for the user (uuid). You can choose to generate this value with a UUID generator tool or assign a random sequence of characters manually.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `username` | Unique username for the user. This is the primary identifier for logging into the HM console. It can be the same as `email`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
