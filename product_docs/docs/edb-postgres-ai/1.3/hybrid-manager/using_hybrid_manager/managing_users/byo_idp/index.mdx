For production deployments, we strongly recommend configuring an external IdP like LDAP, SAML, or another [supported Dex connector](https://dexidp.io/docs/connectors/). Doing so ensures robust and secure user management. Here are some examples:

- [LDAP connector with Okta](ldap)

- [SAML connector with Okta](saml)

For testing or demo environments, you can simplify operations by [creating additional native users](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/managing_users/native_users/create_native_user/).
