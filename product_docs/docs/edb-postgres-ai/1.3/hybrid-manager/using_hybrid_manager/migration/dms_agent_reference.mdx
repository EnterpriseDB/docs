## DMS Agent general configuration

These parameters define the information the EDB DMS Agent requires to:

- Access the Hybrid Manager (HM) instance and project that you are using for the migration
- Connect to the source database and collect data or connect to the destination database and migrate data

!!!note 
    A DMS Agent instance can only run in either reader or writer mode.

### DBCONFIG_ID

This is the name you assign to identify a source/destination. This name will later appear either as a *source* in the **Migrate** > **Sources** section of the HM Console, or as a *destination* in the **Migrate** > **Destinations** section.

Consider the following ID guidelines:

-   The maximum character length for the ID is 255 characters.
-   You can use lowercase and uppercase characters, numbers, underscores(\_) and hyphens(-) for the ID. Other special characters aren't supported.
-   The ID must be unique within a project. Don't use the same ID for two or more sources/destinations in the same project.

### RUN_MODE

Determines how the EDB DMS Agent will run. Set it to `reader` if you are using the DMS Agent to connect the HM with a migration source. Set it to `writer` if you are connecting the HM with an external, self-managed migration destination.

You only need to run the DMS Agent in writer mode if the destination for your migration is a self-managed Postgres database.

### RW_SERVICE_HOST

Specifies the URL of the Data Migration Service (DMS) that the EDB DMS Agent uses to perform migrations. Because the `RW_SERVICE_HOST` leverages the DMS (transporter) service for migrations, you can derive it from `TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME`, a domain name established by HM administrators or installers for migration component communication.

To obtain the `RW_SERVICE_HOST`:

1. Ask the installer or administrator of the HM to provide the value for `TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME`.

1. Add the `https://` protocol prefix and append `/transporter` to the admin-provided URL. 

This modified URL is the correct value to set for `RW_SERVICE_HOST`.

<br/>

The `RW_SERVICE_HOST` value must always be derived directly from the `TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME`. The following table provides examples of how the `RW_SERVICE_HOST` is derived, showing both a recommended and a custom naming convention.

Recommended:

| TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME            | RW_SERVICE_HOST                                                   |
|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| dms.examplecompany.com                | https://dms.examplecompany.com/transporter                |
| dms-dev.examplecompany.com            | https://dms-dev.examplecompany.com/transporter            |
| dms.hm001.examplecompany.com          | https://dms.hm001.examplecompany.com/transporter          |
| dms-hm-us-east-001.examplecompany.com | https://dms-hm-us-east-001.examplecompany.com/transporter |

Custom: 

| TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME    | RW_SERVICE_HOST                                           |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|

### CREDENTIAL_DIRECTORY_PATH

Set this parameter to the directory path of the credentials folder you [downloaded from the HM Console](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migration_guides/self_managed_pg_to_self_managed_pg/creating_project_credentials/).

## DMS Agent database configuration

These parameters (`DBCONFIG_DATABASES` section) define a list of source/destination database information the EDB DMS Agent requires to be able to connect to the correct database for the migration.

You can configure the EDB DMS Agent to migrate multiple databases. The `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__TYPE` section delimits the information for the first database. You can use `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_1__TYPE` to provide data for a second database. Add more sections to the EDB DMS Agent (`DBCONFIG_DATABASES_2__TYPE`, `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_3__TYPE`) by increasing the index manually.

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__TYPE

This is the source/destination database type. 

The EDB DMS Agent supports `ORACLE` and `POSTGRES` as source database types (in reader mode), but only `POSTGRES` as a destination type (in writer mode).

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__HOSTNAME

The hostname of the source/destination database.

!!!note

    For RDS databases, ensure the `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__HOSTNAME` value points to the RDS endpoint you can find under the **Connectivity & security** in the AWS Console. A redacted example is `foo_database.cb7asw1xxxxx.eu-west-0.rds.amazonaws.com`.


### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__PORT

The port of the source/destination database.

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__CATALOG

The database name in the source/destination database server.

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__USERNAME

The database username of the source/destination database.

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__PASSWORD

The password for the database username of the source/destination database. You can set an environment variable for the password without specifying it in the script, but the variable must follow the format: `export DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__PASSWORD=password`

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__RESOURCEID

User-defined identifier for resource management. If you previously registered this database with the HM Agent for monitoring and schema ingestion, use the same `resource_id` here. This consistency is essential for the DMS to correctly correlate the resource across both the HM Agent and DMS Agent components.

### FIPS_MODE

If you need to comply with FIPS standards, enable FIPS mode for the DMS Agent by setting the environment variable to true: `export FIPS_MODE=true`.
