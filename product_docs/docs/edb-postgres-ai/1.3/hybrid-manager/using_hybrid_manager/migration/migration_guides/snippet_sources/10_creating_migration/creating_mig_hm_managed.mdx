navTitle: Creating migration

---

After you configured the EDB DMS agent (in reader mode) to establish connections to Hybrid Manager (HM), create a migration in the HM console. A migration establishes a sync between the source database and a destination database with the help of EDB DMS.

1.  In the HM console, select the project from which you want to manage the migration.

2.  In the project, select **Migrate > Migrations**. 

3.  In the **Migrations** page, select **Create New Migration**. 

4.  In the **Create OLTP Migration** page, assign a name to the migration. 

5.  Select the source of the migration. The ID for the EDB DMS agent is listed in the **Source** menu.

6.  Select the migration type: [**Snapshot**](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/terminology/#snapshot-migration) or [**Snapshot + Streaming**](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/terminology/#snapshot--streaming-migration).

7.  Under **Destination Type**, select an HM-managed destination database cluster and database for the migration. Then, select **Next**.

8.  Select the tables and columns to migrate. Modify the table and column names if needed.

9.  Select **Create Migration**.

The HM console displays a new migration.

If you chose the **Snapshot + Streaming** option, the EDB DMS agent is constantly streaming data when the migration displays the **Running** state. Changes to data are replicated from the source to the destination database as long as the migration is running. 

!!!note

    The EDB DMS agent in reader mode streams data changes. It doesn't stream changes in the DDL objects.
