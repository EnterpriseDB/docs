description: Learn how to run the agent as a service when setting up monitoring for Oracle databases with Hybrid Manager.
---

For continuous metric streaming and to ensure your database remains visible in your Hybrid Manager estate, configure the agent to run as a service. This allows it to start automatically on system startup and restart after any errors.

If you don't set up the agent as a service, it will only stream metrics when you manually run it. Furthermore, your database will disappear from your Hybrid Manager's **Estate** 72 hours after the agent stops streaming.

Ensure you've completed agent installation and configuration before setting it up as a service.

!!!note

   Future versions of the agent package may set this up automatically.

This example configures Agent to run on an RHEL 9 machine. However, we provide operating system aids so you know when to replace the values.

!!! Note "Environment variables"
You must ensure that any environment variables referenced in the agent configuration file are accessible to the service at runtime.
!!!

1.  Create a new file using your text editor of choice. This example command uses the vi editor:

    ```shell
    sudo vi /usr/lib/systemd/system/beacon-agent.service
    ```

    Other default system directories on AWS EC2 instances are:

    | Operating system | Default system directory                     |
    | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
    | RHEL             | /usr/lib/systemd/system/beacon-agent.service |
    | Rocky Linux      | /usr/lib/systemd/system/beacon-agent.service |
    | AlmaLinux        | /usr/lib/systemd/system/beacon-agent.service |
    | Ubuntu           | /etc/systemd/system/beacon-agent.service     |
    | Debian           | /lib/systemd/system/beacon-agent.service     |

1.  Paste the following template into the created `beacon-agent.service` file and replace the information in placeholders `< >`.

    ```bash
    # TEMPLATE
 
    [Unit]
    Description=Agent
 
    After=network.target
 
    [Service]
    Type=simple
 
    User=<user>
 
    WorkingDirectory=</home/user/>
    Environment="PATH=</path/to/Oracle/db/binary>:</Oracle/user/binaries>:</system/binaries>" # e.g. /u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0/dbhome_1/bin:/home/oracle/.local/bin:/home/oracle/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin
    Environment="ORACLE_HOME=</path/to/Oracle/db/binary>" # e.g. /u01/app/oracle/product/19.0.0/dbhome_1

    ExecStart=</usr/local/bin/beacon-agent>
 
    Restart=on-failure
    RestartSec=60
 
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    | `Environment=`      | `"PATH=</path/to/Oracle/db/binary>:</Oracle/user/binaries>:</system/binaries>"` | Set to all user and system directories that contain Oracle-related executables to ensure the Agent can use `sqlplus` for schema extraction during runtime. |

1.  Run the following commands to reload, enable, and start your new service. These commands apply to all mentioned operating systems:

    ```shell
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable beacon-agent.service
    sudo systemctl start beacon-agent.service
    ```

1.  Your agent should now be running as a service. Check on the logs by running the following command:

    ```shell
    journalctl -u beacon-agent.service
    ```
