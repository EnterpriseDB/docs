Configure the HM Agent (deployed as `beacon-agent`) to allow it to connect to your Hybrid Manager and fetch monitoring data from the source database.

## Prerequisites

-   You created a machine user and access key with the `estate ingester` role assigned to it. 
-   You need the project ID for the project you are using for this migration. To obtain the ID, navigate to your project and fetch the ID from the URL displayed in the browser.

## Set environment variables

1.  Ensure that following environment variables are available in your configuration.
    These environment variables must be permanently available as they are required each time the HM Agent starts.

    !!!info
       It is possible to set these values directly in the config files, but as they contain secrets it is generally advisable to handle them as environment variables managed through a secrets manager.

    - Set `BEACON_AGENT_ACCESS_KEY` to the access key you obtained from the console when you created a machine user. To set this value for a terminal session:

      ```shell
      export BEACON_AGENT_ACCESS_KEY=<access_key>
      ```

    - Set the `DSN` environment variable to the Data Source Name (DSN) of the database you want to migrate. The `<username>` and `<password>` correspond to the user you granted permissions when preparing the database. To set this value for a terminal session:

      ```shell
      export DSN="oracle://<username>:<password>@localhost:8999/<oracle_db_name>"
      ```

      For example: 

      ```shell
      export DSN="oracle://oracle:oracle@localhost:1521/ORCLPDB1"
      ```

      If you plan to connect to more than one database with then HM Agent, you can specify multiple such variables, for example `DSN1`, `DSN2`. 
      You can use any name you wish for these variables because they will be referenced by name in the configuration file.

## Prepare a configuration file

1.  Create a Beacon configuration directory in your home directory:

    ```shell
    mkdir ${HOME}/.beacon
    ```

    !!!Note
    If the location specified above is not convenient, you also use either:

    - `/etc/beacon`
    - The directory from which you execute any `beacon-agent` command. 
    
    The HM Agent looks for its configuration file starting with `/etc/beacon`, then `${HOME}/.beacon`. As a final fallback, it searches the directory from which it's executed.
    !!!

1.  Inside this directory, create a new file `beacon_agent.yaml`:

    ```shell
    touch .beacon/beacon_agent.yaml
    ```

1.  Copy and paste the following template into the new file. This template is designed to ingest all schemas the user has access to. To limit schema ingestion, see [Controlling schema ingestion](#controlling-schema-ingestion).

    ```yaml
    ---
    agent:
      access_key: $BEACON_AGENT_ACCESS_KEY
      beacon_server: <beacon-server>:9443
      project_id: <project-id>
      providers:
        - onprem
      root_ca_path: ""
      schema_providers:
        - "onprem-schema"
    provider:
      onprem:
        databases:
          - resource_id: "<resource_id>"
            dsn: $DSN
            schema:
              enabled: true
              poll_interval: 15s 
            tags:
              - "<tag_names>"
    ```

1.  Edit the placeholders denoted by `<>` with appropriate values.
    Refer to [Parameter reference](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/configure_agent/#parameter-reference) for explanations of each parameter and how to obtain the appropriate value.

The HM Agent is now configured, you may proceed to running or configuring the HM Agent to run as a service.

### Controlling schema ingestion

The previous template allows the Agent to ingest all schemas the Oracle user has permissions to and contains at least one table (as specified in [Preparing your source Oracle database](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migration_guides/oracle_to_hm_managed/agent_preparing_oracle/)).

To control which schemas the Agent ingests from your Oracle database, add the `filter` parameter within the `databases.schema` configuration block. This allows you to specify a set of schemas to either include or exclude.

The filter parameter requires two settings:

- `mode`: Defines the filtering behavior. It must be set to either `include` or `exclude`. When set to `include`, the Agent only ingests schemas listed in the names list. When set to `exclude`, the Agent ingests all schemas except those listed in the names list.

- `names`: A list of schema names to apply the filter to.

#### Include example

```yaml
[...]
provider:
  onprem:
    databases:
      - resource_id: "<resource_id>"
        dsn: $DSN
        schema:
          enabled: true
          poll_interval: 15s 
          filter:
            mode: "include"
            names: 
              - "<schema_name1>"
              - "<schema_name2>"
        tags:
          - "<tag_names>"
```

#### Exclude example

```yaml
[...]
provider:
  onprem:
    databases:
      - resource_id: "<resource_id>"
        dsn: $DSN
        schema:
          enabled: true
          poll_interval: 15s 
          filter:
            mode: "exclude"
            names: 
              - "<schema_name1>"
              - "<schema_name2>"
        tags:
          - "<tag_names>"
```
