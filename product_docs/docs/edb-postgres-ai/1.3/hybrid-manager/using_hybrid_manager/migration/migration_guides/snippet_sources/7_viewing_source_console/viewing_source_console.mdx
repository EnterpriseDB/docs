description: Learn about creating sources to prepare for database migrations to Hybrid Manager.
---

*Sources* are databases you connect to Hybrid Manager (HM) using the EDB DMS agent in reader mode so you can use them for migrations.

To verify a source was recognized by the EDB DMS agent and is available for a migration: 

1.  In the HM console, select the project you're using for the current migration. 

2.  From the left navigation menu, select **Migrate > Sources**. 

Each source's view shows the database name, database type (Postgres or Oracle), `cdcagent` ID, the current status, the source type, and more.

## More information

For a description of the available data on this page of the HM console, see [Sources](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migrate/sources/).
