These are the tasks involved in an end-to-end migration from an Oracle database to a database cluster managed by Hybrid Manager (HM).

## Prepare your source database

Preparing your source database for schema ingestion, migration assessment, and subsequent data migration involves creating a dedicated user for both the HM agent and DMS agent and altering the database configuration to enable replication features.

1.  [Prepare your source for schema ingestion](agent_preparing_oracle).

1.  [Prepare the source for data migration](preparing_source_oracle_db).

## Ingest source schema and assess the database

Install and configure the HM agent with your Oracle database. This process performs a migration assessment to help you scope the effort, complexity, and time required for the migration. Also, the HM agent extracts schema DDL that you can use to perform schema migrations with the built-in Migration Portal.

1.  [Create a machine user for registration with the HM agent](agent_creating_machine_user).

1.  [Install the HM agent](agent_installing).

1.  [Configure the HM agent to register your Oracle database](agent_configuring_oracle).

1.  [Run the HM agent](agent_running).

1.  [Run the HM agent as a service](agent_service).

1.  [Verify the HM agent has registered your Oracle database and view the migration assessment results](agent_verifying_assessment).

## Create a destination database

Create a cluster in the HM instance to host the destination database.

1.  [Create a destination database in HM](creating_destination_db).

## Migrate your schema

Use the Migration Portal integration to handle incompatibilities and transfer your schemas.

1.  [Handle constraints for schema migration](handling_schema). 

1.  [Migrate schemas using the Migration Portal integration](migrating_schema). 

## Migrate your data

Execute the data transfer and complete the final cleanup steps.

1.  [Create project credentials for the data migration](creating_project_credentials).

1.  [Configure the DMS agent in reader mode for a data migration](configuring_reader).

1.  [Verify your source database appears in the HM console](viewing_source).

1.  [Create and perform the data migration](creating_migration). 

1.  [Finalize the migration](finalizing_migration) (for streaming migrations only).

1.  [Apply excluded constraints](applying_constraints).
