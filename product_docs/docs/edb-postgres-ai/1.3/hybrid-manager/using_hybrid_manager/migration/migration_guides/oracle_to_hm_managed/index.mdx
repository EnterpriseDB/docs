his section collects all the procedures that involve an end-to-end migration from an **Oracle database** to an **HM-managed database cluster**.

## Ingest source schema and perform a migration assessment

Install and configure the HM agent with your Oracle database. This process performs a migration assessment to help you scope the effort, complexity, and time required for the migration. Additionally, the HM agent extracts schema DDL that you can use to perform schema migrations with the built-in Migration Portal.

1.  [Prepare your Oracle database for registration with the HM agent](agent_preparing_oracle).

1.  [Create a machine user for registration with the HM agent](agent_creating_machine_user).

1.  [Install the HM agent](agent_installing).

1.  [Configure the HM agent to register your Oracle database](agent_configuring_oracle).

1.  [Run the HM agent](agent_running).

1.  [Run the HM agent as a service](agent_service).

1.  [Verify the HM agent has registered your Oracle database and view the migration assessment results](agent_verifying_assessment).

## Create a destination database

Now, create a cluster in the HM instance to hosts the destination database.

1.  [Create a destination database in HM](creating_destination_db).

## Migrate your schema

Use the Migration Portal integration to handle incompatibilities and transfer your schemas.

1.  [Handle constraints for schema migration](handling_schema). 

1.  [Migrate schemas using the Migration Portal integration](migrating_schema). 

## Prepare your source for migration

Prepare the source database and configure the DMS agent to connect the source to the HM console.

1.  [Prepare the source Oracle database](preparing_source_oracle_db).

1.  [Create project credentials for the data migration](creating_project_credentials).

1.  [Configure the DMS Agent in reader mode for a data migration](configuring_reader).

1.  [Verify your source database appears in the HM Console](viewing_source).

## Migrate your data

Execute the data transfer and complete the final cleanup steps.

1.  [Create and perform the data migration](creating_migration). 

1.  [Finalize the migration](finalizing_migration) (for streaming migrations only).

1.  [Apply excluded constraints](applying_constraints).
