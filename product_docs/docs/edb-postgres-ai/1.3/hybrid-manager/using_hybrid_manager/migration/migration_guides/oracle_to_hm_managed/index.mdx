This section collects all the steps you need to perform a migration from an **Oracle database** to an **HM-managed database cluster**.

## HM Agent configuration

First, install and configure the Hybrid Manager Agent with your Oracle database. This provides a migration assessment that will help you scope the level of effort, complexity and time required for a migration. Additionally, the HM Agent extracts schema DDL that you can leverage to perform schema migrations with the built-in Migration Portal.

1.  [Prepare your Oracle database for registration with the HM Agent](agent_preparing_oracle).

1.  [Create a machine user for registration with the HM Agent](agent_creating_machine_user).

1.  [Install the HM Agent](agent_installing).

1.  [Configure the HM Agent to register your Oracle database](agent_configuring_oracle).

1.  [Run the HM Agent](agent_running).

1.  [Run the HM Agent as a service](agent_service).

1.  [Verify the HM Agent has registered your Oracle database and view the migration assessment results](agent_verifying_assessment).

## Migration

Then, leverage Hybrid Manager's Data Migration Service to perform a schema and data migration.

1.  [Create a destination database in HM](creating_destination_db).

1.  [Prepare the source Oracle database](preparing_source_oracle_db). 

1.  [Handle constraints for schema migration](handling_schema). 

1.  [Migrate schemas using the Migration Portal integration](migrating_schema). 

1.  [Create project credentials for the data migration](creating_project_credentials). 

1.  [Configure the DMS Agent in reader mode for a data migration](configuring_reader).

1.  [Verify your source database appears in the HM Console](viewing_source).

1.  [Create and perform the data migration](creating_migration). 

1.  [Finalize the migration](finalizing_migration) (for streaming migrations only).

1.  [Apply excluded constraints](applying_constraints).
