*Destinations* are databases you connected to Hybrid Manager (HM) using the EDB DMS agent in writer mode so you can use them for migrations.

To verify a destination was recognized by the EDB DMS agent and is available for a migration: 

1.  In the HM console, select the project you're using for the current migration. 

2.  From the left navigation menu, select **Migrate > Destinations**.

Each destinations's view shows the database name, database type, `cdcagent` ID, the current status, the destination type, and more.

## More information

For a description of the available data on this page of the HM console, see [Destinations](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migrate/destinations/).
