Registering an Oracle database with the HM Agent provides migration assessment and schema extraction capabilities.

To assess an Oracle database, the HM Agent needs an Oracle user with access to the database and the necessary permissions to retrieve assessment data. These permissions are required for automated schema extraction and database migration assessment. The HM Agent will still function if these roles aren’t assigned, however, the HM Agent will function in reduced feature capacity.

## Prerequisites 

You installed Oracle's SQL*Plus utility on the auxiliary machine you're using to run the Agent.

## Create and configure an Oracle user

Create an Oracle user (a _common user_ for CDBs, regular user for non-CDBs) for schema extraction and assessment with the HM Agent. You can use this same Oracle user later for data migration with the DMS Agent. 

Alternatively, you can use an existing user, provided you ensure their current permissions meet the following requirements and are not overly broad.

To create the user, log in to Oracle CDB as sysdba. Or, if you're using a non-CDB architecture, log in to your non-CDB database as sysdba.

Ensure the Oracle user you create has access to these resources that allow it to connect, read schema metadata, and perform the assessment:

```
V$VERSION
V$INSTANCE
V$LICENSE
sys.all_tables
sys.all_tab_privs
```

The user must have following privileges:

- `CONNECT`
- `CREATE TABLE`
- `SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE` or `SELECT ANY DICTIONARY`

!!!note
These permissions are the minimum required for schema extraction and assessment. Granting additional permissions may be necessary depending on your specific Oracle database configuration and security policies.

Avoid logging in as  `SYS AS SYSDBA`, `SYSTEM`, or any other user with the `DBA` role unless absolutely necessary, as this can pose security risks.
!!!

You will later specify this user in the `provider.onprem.databases.dsn` section of the HM Agent configuration file.
