Registering an Oracle database with the Hybrid Manager (HM) agent provides migration assessment and schema extraction capabilities.

To assess an Oracle database, the HM agent needs an Oracle user with access to the database and the necessary permissions to retrieve assessment data. These permissions are required for automated schema extraction and database migration assessment. The HM agent will still function if these roles aren’t assigned but in reduced feature capacity.

## Prerequisites 

Install Oracle's SQL\*Plus utility on the auxiliary machine you're using to run the HM agent.

## Create and configure an Oracle user

Create an Oracle user (a _common user_ for CDBs, regular user for non-CDBs) for schema extraction and assessment with the HM agent. You can use this same Oracle user later for data migration with the DMS agent. Create the user following your organization's usual provisioning process, and ensure the user receives the recommended privileges.

Alternatively, you can use an existing user if their current permissions meet the following requirements and aren't overly broad.

To create the user, log in to Oracle CDB as sysdba. Or, if you're using a non-CDB architecture, log in to your non-CDB database as sysdba.

The Oracle user you create needs access to these resources that allow it to connect, read schema metadata, and perform the assessment:

```
V$VERSION
V$INSTANCE
V$LICENSE
sys.all_tables
sys.all_tab_privs
```

The user must have the following privileges:

- `CONNECT` for database connection.
- `CREATE TABLE` to create temporary working tables during the assessment process.
- `SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE` or `SELECT ANY DICTIONARY` to read database metadata and schema information.

!!!note
These permissions are the minimum required for schema extraction and assessment. Granting additional permissions may be necessary depending on your specific Oracle database configuration and security policies.

The `CREATE TABLE` privilege is used by the assessment script to create temporary tables during execution. No permanent changes are made to your database.

`SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE` provides read access to data dictionary views (recommended for least privilege). Alternatively, `SELECT ANY DICTIONARY` is a more comprehensive system privilege that ensures access to all dictionary objects. Either will work for the assessment.

Avoid logging in as  `SYS AS SYSDBA`, `SYSTEM`, or any other user with the `DBA` role unless absolutely necessary, as this can pose security risks.
!!!

You will later specify this user in the `provider.onprem.databases.dsn` section of the HM agent configuration file.
