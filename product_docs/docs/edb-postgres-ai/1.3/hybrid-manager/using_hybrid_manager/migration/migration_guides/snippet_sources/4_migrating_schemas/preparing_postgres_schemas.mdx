## Schema handling for Postgres databases

You can use several different methods to prepare your schema, exclude unsupported constraints and import it to the destination database. This section provides guidelines for how to export and import your schemas for Postgres migrations using Migration Toolkit.

Other valid routes for migrating DDL to import Postgres schemas include manually creating the schemas in the destination database, performing a [pg_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html) to obtain the schemas and [pg_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html) to restore them, or employing [pgAdmin](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/latest/index.html), or [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.0/app-psql.htm).

## Export

For data migrations from Postgres, EDB recommends using [EDB Migration Toolkit](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_toolkit/latest/) to manage the schema. MTK's [offline migration](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_toolkit/latest/07_invoking_mtk/08_mtk_command_options/#offline-migration-options) capability provides an easy way to extract a database's schema and separate constraints. Here are some guidelines:

-   Use the `-offlineMigration` option, so Migration Toolkit can generate SQL scripts that you can apply on destination without having to configure connectivity. 

-   Use the `â€‘schemaOnly <schema_scope>` option, so Migration Toolkit can generate scripts that focus on the export of schemas only.

-   After you run Migration Toolkit, ensure you exclude (comment out) the following constraints from the generated SQL script before applying it on the destination database
    -   foreign key constraints
    -   check constraints 
    -   exclusion constraints 

-   After you run Migration Toolkit, and if you plan to map objects to different names in the destination, modify the schema SQL script to reflect the new names. After the SQL script is generated, edit the object names directly within the script (DDL) before applying it to the destination, while ensuring that the structure and data types of the renamed object in the script exactly match the source. If you manually update object names in the DDL scripts, ensure that you also update the names in other objects that reference the updated objects. For example, if you rename a table, also update any views or constraints that reference the original table name.

    Later, during data migration, ensure you select the newly assigned object names. See [Mapping schema, tables and columns during a migration](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migrate/migrations/#mapping-schema-tables-and-columns-during-a-migration) for more information.

## Import

After you have prepared the DDL and excluded foreign key, check, and exclusion constraints, connect to the destination database and import the SQL-formatted DDL file.

Execute the generated [offline migration script to start the import](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_toolkit/latest/07_invoking_mtk/08_mtk_command_options/#offline-migration-options).

!!!note

    You will have to apply the excluded foreign key, check, and exclusion constraints on the destination database later in the migration process, after the migration is performed successfully. Therefore, ensure you keep track of the excluded contraints, so you can apply them when the time comes.
