This section collects all the steps you need to perform a migration from a **self-managed Postgres database** to an **HM-managed database cluster**.

## Agent configuration (optional)

You can install and configure the Agent to obtain observability and monitoring data for your Postgres database. This step also provides preliminary database insights, such as high-level data on schemas, tables, and objects, which can be used for migration planning. It is not, however, a requirement for performing the migration itself.

To register a database with the Agent, see [Monitoring self-managed deployments](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/).

## Migration

Leverage Hybrid Manager's Data Migration Service to perform a schema and data migration.
