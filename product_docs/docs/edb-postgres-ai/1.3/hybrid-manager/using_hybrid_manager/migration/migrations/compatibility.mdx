After registering a self-managed database with the Hybrid Manager (HM) agent, HM generates a migration assessment. Assessments are currently supported for the following database versions.

!!!note 
    Currently, the Postgres assessments offer a high-level migration overview. A more detailed analysis is available for Oracle databases.

## Oracle

-   Oracle 11g
-   Oracle 12c
-   Oracle 18c
-   Oracle 19c

Later versions (for example, 21c, 23c) might also be assessed, but they aren't yet fully certified. 

## Postgres

-   PostgreSQL 13-17
-   EDB Postgres Advanced Server 13-17
-   EDB Postgres Extended Server 13-17
