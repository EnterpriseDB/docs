The EDB Data Migration Service (EDB DMS) is only available as part of the Hybrid Manager (HM).

## Supported source databases

The following database versions are supported.

| Database version                             | Supported source |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| PostgreSQL 12 - 17                           | Y                |
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server 12 - 17         | Y                |
| EDB Postgres Extended Server 12 - 17         | Y                |
| Oracle 19c                                   | Y                |
| Oracle 21c (\*)                              | Y                |
| Oracle 23ai (\*)                             | Y                |
| AWS RDS PostgreSQL 13-17                     | Y                |
| AWS RDS Aurora (PostgreSQL compatible) 13-17 | Y                |

The supported Postgres source databases only include externally-managed (self-managed) databases.

!!!note

    (\*) The Data Migration Service Agent supports migrating Oracle 21c and 23ai databases. However, Migration Portal doesn't. This means that to migrate 21c and 23ai databases, you must manually perform the schema migration.

### Oracle

The EDB DMS stack requires the Oracle database to have archive log mode enabled and supplemental logging data enabled at the table and database level. For details, see [Preparing Oracle source databases](migration_guides/oracle_to_hm_managed/preparing_source_oracle_db/).

Container databases (CDB/PDB) and non-CDB sources are supported.

### Postgres

When migrating from Postgres towards Postgres, cross-version and cross-distribution migrations are supported. You can migrate data from one version of PostgreSQL to another, such as from PostgreSQL 16 to PostgreSQL 17, or from PostgreSQL 17 to EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17. The exception is that you can't migrate from EDB Postgres Advanced Server as a source to a different distribution (for example, to PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Extended Server).

Source Postgres instances can be self-managed instances on bare metal machines, virtual machines, or they can be hosted by a cloud service provider like AWS (RDS or Aurora databases).

Postgres sources require a database role or user that can manage replications. For details, see [Preparing Postgres source databases](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migration_guides/self_managed_pg_to_hm_managed/preparing_source_pg_db/).

## Supported destination databases

Data Migration Service supports migrating to both HM-managed databases (on clusters created with Hybrid Manager) and self-managed databases running Postgres.

| Database version                          | Supported destination |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------- |
| PostgreSQL 11 - 17 (\*)                   | Y                     |
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11 - 17 (\*) | Y                     |
| EDB Postgres Extended Server 11 - 17 (\*) | Y                     |

!!!note

    (\*) For HM-managed database clusters, support is limited to versions 16 and 17.

    The Data Migration Service supports migrating to all databases listed in the table. However, Migration Portal supports schema migrations only for EDB Postgres Advanced Server versions 16 and 17. For version 15 and earlier, schema migration must be performed manually.

### Oracle

The EDB DMS doesn't support migrations to Oracle destinations yet.

### Postgres

When migrating from Postgres towards Postgres, cross-version and cross-distribution migrations as supported, for example from PostgreSQL 16 to 17 or from PostgreSQL 17 to EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17.

Postgres destinations require a database role or user that can manage replications. For details, see [Preparing Postgres destination databases](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migration_guides/self_managed_pg_to_self_managed_pg/preparing_destination_selfpg_db/).

## Supported operating systems

The DMS Agent runs on Linux. For details, see [Installing EDB DMS Agent](installing_agent).
