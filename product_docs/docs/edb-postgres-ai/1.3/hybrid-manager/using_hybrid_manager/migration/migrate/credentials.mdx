description: Learn about creating credentials to prepare for database migrations to Hybrid Manager.
---

You need credentials to perform migrations. Before you can add a source or destination for a migration to Hybrid Manager (HM), you must create migration credentials. You can then use them to allow the EDB DMS agent to connect to HM. 

The **Credentials** view shows all the credentials in the project in a table format. The entry for each credential includes its name, status, when it was created, and expiry date.

### Creating migration credentials

See [Getting credentials](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migration_guides/self_managed_pg_to_self_managed_pg/creating_project_credentials/) to create and download migration credentials.

The decompressed credentials folder contains these files: 

-   `int.crt`
-   `int.truststore.p12`
-   `client.keystore.p12`
-   `client-key.pem`
-   `client-cert.pem`
