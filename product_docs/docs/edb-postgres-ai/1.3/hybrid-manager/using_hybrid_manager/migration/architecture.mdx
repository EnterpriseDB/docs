The Hybrid Manager (HM) provides a unified platform for migrating databases from various sources to HM-managed, as well as externally-managed Postgres clusters. The migration process relies on several key components that work together to handle schema conversion, data transfer, and continuous replication.

## From Oracle

Migrations from Oracle are best suited for targeting EDB Postgres Advanced Server clusters (HM-managed or externally-managed). Given the differences between the two database systems, these migrations require a specific set of components to handle both schema and data migration, with EDB Postgres Advanced Server being optimized for this purpose.

**Oracle database:** The source database containing the data and schemas to be migrated.

**Agent:** A component that connects to the Oracle source to read and extract schemas for migration. Additionally, registering the source with Hybrid Manager, provides a view of the source database within the HM Console for migration assessment and to enable schema migration.

**DMS Agent in reader mode:** A component that connects to the Oracle source to read and extract data for migration.

**Hybrid Manager:** The central control plane.

**HM Console:** The web-based interface where users manage and monitor all migration activities.

**Migration Portal:** A service within Hybrid Manager that handles Oracle-specific schema assessment, conversion, and import to the destination database, while ensuring compatibility with EDB Postgres Advanced Server. It can also assist with schema-related issues using an AI Copilot.

**Data Migration Service (DMS):** The core service that performs the actual data transfer (snapshot) and continuous change replication (streaming). It includes a built-in writer for migrations to HM-managed databases.

**HM-managed EPAS database:** A destination database cluster that is created and managed by the Hybrid Manager.

**DMS Agent in writer mode:** A component that you only require when the migration destination database is a self-managed database, external to HM. It consumes CDC records to replicate and apply changes on the destination database.

**External EPAS database:** An externally-managed destination for migrations, also called self-managed databases. This scenario requires an additional DMS Agent component in writer mode that you connect to the destination host to receive and apply data.

See [Oracle to HM-managed database](migration_guides/oracle_to_hm_managed/) for an end-to-end example of how you would perform a migration.

## From Postgres

Migrating between Postgres databases is a more streamlined process as the schema is already compatible. This migration is primarily focused on efficient data transfer and replication, and also requires a specific set of components for migration:

**External Postgres database:** The source Postgres database containing the data to be migrated.

**Migration Toolkit or pg_dump:** External tools used for the initial schema migration, as the schema itself does not require conversion.

**Agent:** A component that registers the source with the Hybrid Manager to provide a view of the source database within the HM Console for monitoring. 

**DMS Agent in reader mode:** A component that connects to the source Postgres to read and extract data.

**Hybrid Manager:** The central control plane.

**HM Console:** The web-based interface where users manage and monitor all migration activities.

**Data Migration Service (DMS):** The core service that performs the actual data transfer (snapshot) and continuous change replication (streaming). It includes a built-in writer for migrations to HM-managed databases.

**HM-managed Postgres database:** A destination database cluster that is created and managed by the Hybrid Manager. It can be PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server.

**DMS Agent in writer mode:** A component that you only require when the migration destination database is a self-managed database, external to HM. It consumes CDC records to replicate and apply changes on the destination database.

**External Postgres database:** An externally-managed destination for migrations, also called self-managed databases. This scenario requires an additional DMS Agent component in write mode that you connect to the destination host to receive and apply data.

See [Self-managed Postgres to HM-managed database](migration_guides/self_managed_pg_to_hm_managed/) for an end-to-end example of how you would perform a migration.
