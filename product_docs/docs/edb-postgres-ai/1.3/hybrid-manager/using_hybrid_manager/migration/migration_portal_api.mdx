The Migration API is a crucial tool for automating your database migration tasks. It allows you to programmatically manage and monitor migrations, offering a powerful way to integrate migration workflows into your existing CI/CD pipelines or automated scripts. Instead of manually navigating the UI, you can use the API to manage your migration projects, view the detailed schema reports, data migration status and many more administrative tasks.

This API is designed for developers, DevOps engineers, and DBAs who need a scalable and automated way to handle a large number of migrations or integrate them into broader automation strategies.

## Examples

### Create Migration Portal Project

This API endpoint is used to create a new migration project within the Migration Portal. It's a `POST` request that sends a JSON payload to define the project's properties and configurations.

- **Path** &mdash; `/api/v1/projects/prj_LTIfqp81u6MslAk4/migration-portal-project`
- **Method** &mdash; `POST`

**Request Body Description:**

-  `projectId` &mdash; The unique identifier of the project in the EDB system.
-  `resourceId` &mdash; The unique identifier for the source database (e.g., `oracleBeaconSource`).
-  `schemaIds` &mdash; An array of unique IDs for the schemas you want to include in the migration project.
-  `mpProjectName` &mdash; The custom name you want to give the new migration project.
-  `applicationInterface` &mdash; The type of interface used to connect to the source database (e.g., `JDBC`).
-  `targetDbVersion` &mdash; The version of the target database you're migrating to (e.g., `EPAS_17` for EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 17).
-  `useUniqueSchemaObjectSuffixes` &mdash; A boolean value that, when set to `true`, ensures that object names in the target schema will have unique - suffixes to avoid conflicts.
-  `useOracleDefaultCase` &mdash; A boolean value that, when set to `true`, respects Oracle's default behavior of using uppercase for object names.
-  `assessDefaultProfile` &mdash; A boolean value that, when set to `true`, includes the default profile in the assessment.
-  `description` &mdash; A custom, optional description for the migration project.


### Delete Migration Portal Project

This API endpoint deletes an existing migration project from the Migration Portal. It's a `DELETE` request that targets the specific project by its ID.

- **Path** &mdash; `/api/v1/projects/prj_LTIfqp81u6MslAk4/migration-portal-project/42`
- **Method** &mdash; `DELETE`

**URL Path Parameters:**

- `prj_LTIfqp81u6MslAk4` &mdash; The unique identifier for the project's scope.
- `42` &mdash; The unique ID of the specific migration portal project you want to delete. This ID is assigned after the project is successfully created.
