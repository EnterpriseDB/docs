The Migration Portal API is a crucial tool for automating your database migration tasks. It allows you to programmatically manage and monitor migrations, offering a powerful way to integrate migration workflows into your existing CI/CD pipelines or automated scripts. Instead of manually navigating the UI, you can use the API to:

- **List and manage projects** &mdash; Create, view, or delete migration projects.

- **View migration details** &mdash; Retrieve detailed reports on schema and data migration status.

This API is designed for developers, DevOps engineers, and DBAs who need a scalable and automated way to handle a large number of migrations or integrate them into broader automation strategies.
