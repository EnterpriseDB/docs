The Migration API is a crucial tool for automating your database migration tasks. It allows you to programmatically manage and monitor migrations, offering a powerful way to integrate migration workflows into your existing CI/CD pipelines or automated scripts. Instead of manually navigating the UI, you can use the API to manage your migration projects, view the detailed schema reports, data migration status and many more administrative tasks.

This API is designed for developers, DevOps engineers, and DBAs who need a scalable and automated way to handle a large number of migrations or integrate them into broader automation strategies.
