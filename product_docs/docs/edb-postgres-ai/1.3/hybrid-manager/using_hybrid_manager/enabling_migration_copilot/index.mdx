After deploying the Hybrid Manager (HM), [Migration Portal](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_portal/latest/), a Launchpad tool to help you migrate external database schemas, works out of the box. 

However, the [AI Copilot](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_portal/latest/03_mp_using_portal/mp_ai_copilot/), a chat-bot tool that helps you resolve schema migration compatibility issues within the Migration Portal, is not enabled by default, so you need additional configuration to enable it.

You can configure the AI Copilot using OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, or an alternative AI vendor. Alternatively, you can configure the AI Copilot to work with a self-hosted model you previously created within the HM with EDB AI Factory capabilities.
