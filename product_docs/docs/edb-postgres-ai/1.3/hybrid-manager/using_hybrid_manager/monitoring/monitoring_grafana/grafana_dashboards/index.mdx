The Grafana service shipped with Hybrid Manager (HM) comes with default dashboards designed to monitor different HM resources. Alternatively, create your own custom dashboard to display specific data that serves your organization's requirements.

## Default Grafana dashboards

The Grafana service shipped with HM comes with default dashboards that are grouped into the following categories: 

-   [Kubernetes dashboards](kubernetes_dashboards.mdx)
-   [Loki dashboards](loki_dashboards.mdx)
-   [Postgres dashboards](postgres_dashboards.mdx)
-   [Telemetry dashboards](telemetry_dashboards.mdx)
-   [Other dashboards](other_dashboards.mdx)

!!!note

    The dashboard descriptions offer a generalized and exemplified overview of the default dashboards included with HM's Grafana. The availability of specific metrics depends on your environment.

## Custom dashboards

See Grafana's documentation to [create your own dashboard](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/dashboards/build-dashboards/create-dashboard/).

!!!warning

    Ensure you have a backup of any customized Grafana dashboards and have them stored on a version control repository. Any customized Grafana dashboards are deleted whenever the Grafana instance is updated or redeployed, for example, due to an HM upgrade, node Kubernetes version upgrade, or general node failure.
