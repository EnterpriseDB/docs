description: Learn how to monitor Kubernetes using dashboards with Hybrid Manager.
---

These dashboards provide insights into the health and performance of the underlying Kubernetes infrastructure that powers Hybrid Manager (HM). 

These are prebuilt dashboards called [Kubernetes mixins](https://github.com/kubernetes-monitoring/kubernetes-mixin) from Grafana's official library.

## Kubernetes / API server

!!!note

    This dashboard displays data only for on-premises HM deployments, as Grafana requires node-level access to the API server.

**Description:** Monitors the performance and availability of the Kubernetes API server, a critical component for all interactions with the cluster. 

**Metrics** These metrics include read and write availability, work queue latency, read and write errors, resource utilization, among others.

**Usage:** Use this to identify API latency issues or availability problems.

## Kubernetes / Compute resources / \*

![Compute Resources by Node and Pods](../../../../images/k8s_compute_dashboard.png)

Compute resources are displayed in multiple dashboards that provide different views: **Cluster** , **Namespace (Pods)**, **Namespace (Workloads)**, **Node (Pods)**, **Pod**, or **Workload**.

-   **Cluster** displays resource utilization for the entire Kubernetes cluster, as well as utilization per namespace. 

-   **Namespace (Pods)** displays resource utilization that you can filter by Kubernetes namespaces, focusing on pod/service consumption.

-   **Namespace (Workloads)** displays resource utilization that you can filter by Kubernetes namespaces and by workload type (deployments, daemonsets, StatefulSets, and so on), focusing on individual workload consumption.

-   **Node (Pods)** shows resource utilization that you can filter by individual Kubernetes nodes, broken down by the pods running on them. 

-   **Pod** provides detailed resource usage for individual Kubernetes pods in a specific namespace. 

-   **Workload** shows detailed resource usage for a specific Kubernetes workload (for example, a deployment workload) in a specific namespace. 

**Description:** Shows the resource utilization at the Kubernetes cluster level. Each of the subdashboards presents the data differently, focusing on different Kubernetes levels and offering different filtering options.

**Metrics:** Metrics include CPU, memory, bandwidth, packet rates, IOPS, throughput, and more.

**Usage:** Use these dashboards to:

- Understand the resource consumption across all workloads
- Identify resource-intensive applications or teams
- Understand the resource footprint of specific workloads in an application and of specific pods in a node
- Troubleshoot performance issues with specific application instances
- Monitor the performance of a particular application component

## Kubernetes / Kubelet

![Kubelet dashboard](../../../../images/k8s_kubelet_dashboard.png)

**Description:**  Monitors the health and performance of the [Kubelet](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/command-line-tools-reference/kubelet/) service running on each Kubernetes node, responsible for managing containers. You can see the aggregated performance of all kubelets, filter by kubelet instance and drill down into specific kubelet operations.

**Metrics:** Metrics include kubelet count, pods count, countainers count, operation rates, operations durations, pod lifecycle operation rates, operation error rates, and more.

**Usage:** Use this to identify node-level agent activity, operation behavior, latency and troubleshoot performance issues on a particular node.

## Kubernetes / Networking \*

![Networking overall cluster dashboard](../../../../images/k8s_networking_cluster_dashboard.png)

Networking resources are displayed in multiple dashboards that provide different views: **Cluster** , **Namespace (Pods)**, **Namespace (Workloads)**, **Pod**, or **Workload**.

-   **Cluster** displays network utilization for the entire Kubernetes cluster, as well as per namespace.

-   **Namespace (Pods)** shows network traffic metrics that you can filter by Kubernetes namespaces, focusing on the pods in that namespace. 

-   **Namespace (Workloads)** shows network traffic metrics that you can filter by Kubernetes namespaces and by workload type (deployments, daemonsets, StatefulSets, etc.), focusing on individual workload traffic.

-   **Pod** provides detailed network traffic metrics for individual Kubernetes pods in a specific namespace.

-   **Workload** shows detailed network traffic metrics for a specific Kubernetes workload (for example, a deployment workload).

**Description:** Shows the network usage at the Kubernetes cluster level. Each of the subdashboards presents the data differently, focusing on different Kubernetes levels and offering different filtering options.

**Metrics:** Metrics include rates of bytes received and transmitted, rates of packets received and transmitted, receive and transmit bandwidth, and more.

**Usage:** Use these dashboards to:
-  Understand overall network communication patterns, traffic, throughput, and potential bottlenecks
-  Analyze network patterns for specific applications
-  Understand the resource footprint of specific workloads in an application
-  Troubleshoot network connectivity issues with specific pods in an application
-  Monitor the network performance of a particular application component

## Kubernetes / Persistent Volumes

![Persistent Volumes dashboard](../../../../images/k8s_persistentvolumes_dashboard.png)

**Description:** Monitors the usage and performance of persistent volumes ([PVs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)) in the Kubernetes cluster. You can filter the results per namespace and persistent volume claim ([PVCs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)).

**Metrics:** Metrics include free and used space.

**Usage:** Use this to identify storage bottlenecks and capacity issues, plan for storage expansions, and monitor storage costs.

## Kubernetes / StatefulSets

![StatefulSets dashboard](../../../../images/k8s_stateful_dashboard.png)

**Description:** Provides specific monitoring for Kubernetes [StatefulSets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/statefulset/), which manage stateful applications. You can filter results by namespace (=application) and StatefulSet name.

**Metrics:** Metrics include CPU, memory, and network consumption, as well as replicas.

**Usage:** Use this to monitor the stability, performance, and resource consumption of your stateful applications and track whether your stateful applications have met their desired replicas.

## Kubernetes CoreDNS

![CoreDNS dashboard](../../../../images/k8s_coreDNS_dashboard.png)

**Description:** Monitors the performance and health of the CoreDNS service, which provides DNS resolution in the Kubernetes cluster, enabling communication within the pods and services.

**Metrics:** The metrics include DNS request rates by protocol, query type, DNS zone, size, response code, response duration, response size, and others.
**Usage** Use this to monitor the reliability and efficiency of the CoreDNS component and identify any discovery and communication issues among services.
