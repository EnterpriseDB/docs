description: Learn administrative tasks for Beacon Agent with Hybrid Manager.
---

To configure the agent, the user needs access to some resources that they can’t obtain by themselves. However, these resources are available to administrators, as they have the rights and permissions to configure certificate and host-related settings while installing Hybrid Manager (HM) or after.

## What is the `beacon_server`?

To configure the agent, the user must set the `beacon_server` value in the `beacon_agent.yaml` file. This is a string consisting of two values: host and port. 

The host is the URL configured in your `values.yaml` file under `upm-beacon.server_host`. The port is fixed as 9443.

## What is the root certificate authority (CA)?

The agent makes a secure connection to the `beacon_server` URL using TLS. You therefore need the machine on which the agent is running to trust the server certificate provided by `beacon_server`.
Generally, this trust is already managed by your organization's existing security infrastructure. The certificate authority (CA) responsible for signing your internal server certificates must be configured as a trusted CA across your network. This ensures that servers within your environment, including the one running the agent, inherently trust certificates issued by this CA.

If this isn't the case, the user can set the `root_ca_path` value in the `beacon_agent.yaml` file. This is a directory where the user stored the root certificate, which is capable of validating the EDB Postgres AI Platform server certificate. However, non-admin users don’t have access to the certificate, so you need to provide it to them.

To see the Kubernetes secret containing the root certificate:

```
# The certificate is base64 encoded as the data field "public.crt"
kubectl get secret -n upm-beacon beaconator-ca-bundle -o json
```

For a more readable output that prints only the root certificate, ensure you have `jq` and `base64` installed and run:

```
# If `jq` and `base64` are available
kubectl get secret -n upm-beacon beaconator-ca-bundle -o json | jq -r '.data."public.crt"' | base64 --decode
```

This command outputs the contents of the certificate. Send them to the person that requires them through a secure channel. The user msut store it locally in crt format.
