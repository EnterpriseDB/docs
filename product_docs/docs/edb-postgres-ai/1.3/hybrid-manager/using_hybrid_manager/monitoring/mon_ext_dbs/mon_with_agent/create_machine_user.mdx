In the Hybrid Manager (HM) console, create a machine user that the agent can use to ingest data into your estate.

## Creating a machine user

1.  Select your profile's icon in the upper-right corner. 
2.  Select **User Management > Add New User**.
3.  On the **Add New User** page, enter a name for the new user. 
4.  Optionally, enter an email address for the user.
5.  Select **Create Access Key**. The form expands to request an **Access Key Name** and an **Expiry** time.
6.  Select **Add User**.
7.  Store the access key safely. You won't be able to access the key again. Select **Key stored safely**. 

## Assigning roles

1.  Select the **Projects** tab to view all your projects. 
2.  Select the project from which you want to monitor the database. 
3.  Select the **Users** option in the left-side navigation, and locate the machine user you just created.
4.  Select the edit button (pen icon) of the user entry.
5.  Select **Assign Roles**.

Your new machine user is ready to ingest data from the agent.
