Run the agent: 

```
beacon-agent
```

The agent starts sending data to Hybrid Manager (HM). Follow the logs to monitor the data ingestion process. After a few minutes, you the data from the agent appears in the HM Console: 

-  The **Estate > Postgres** tab lists your Postgres databases along with summarized database information. Selecting one of the databases provides a more detailed database overview and monitoring capabilities.

-  The **Estate > Migrations** tab lists your external databases (for example, Oracle) along with summarized database and migration information. Selecting one of the databases provides a more detailed migration assessment and migration capabilities.

    The agent detects schema changes to tables and columns while running. However, changes to views or procedures aren't detected until you restart the agent.

For production use, configure the agent to run as a service.
