Run the agent using the following command: 

```
beacon-agent
```

The Agent starts sending data to Hybrid Manager (HM). Follow the logs to monitor the data ingestion process. After a few minutes, you should see the data from the Agent in the HM console: 

-  The **Estate** > **Postgres** tab lists your Postgres databases along with summarized database information. If you select one of the databases, it provides a more detailed database overview and monitoring capabilities.

-  The **Estate** > **Migrations** lists your external databases (for example, Oracle) along with summarized database and migration information. If you select one of the databases, it provides a more detailed migration assessment and migration capabilities.

    The Agent detects schema changes to tables and columns while running. However, changes to views or procedures won't be detected until you restart the Agent.

For production usage, configure the Agent to run as a service.
