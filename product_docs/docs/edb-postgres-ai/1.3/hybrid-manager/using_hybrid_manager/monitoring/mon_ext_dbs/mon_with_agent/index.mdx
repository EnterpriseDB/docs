To monitor self-managed external Postgres instances from Hybrid Manager (HM) that are deployed on bare metal or virtual machines, you must first install Beacon Agent. The agent provides monitoring and observability metrics to your HM.

To have monitoring, query diagnostics, and recommendations for your self-managed Postgres instance:

1.  [Create an OS user to run the agent.](agent_os_user.mdx)
2.  [Prepare your database.](prepare_postgres_database.mdx)
3.  [Create a machine user.](create_machine_user.mdx)
4.  [Install the agent.](/tools/agent/installing/) )
5.  [Configure the agent.](configure_agent.mdx)
6.  [Run the agent.](run_agent.mdx)
7.  [Configure the agent to run as a service.](run_as_service.mdx)

!!!note
   To leverage full observability capabilities, we recommend deploying one agent per host machine with self-managed database clusters. Then, you can configure the agent on that host to connect to each database with a dedicated DSN string. Details on DSN configuration are provided in the agent configuration section.

For extra help with administrative tasks needed to configure the agent, see [Administrative tasks](admin_tasks.mdx).

See [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.mdx) for help with general troubleshooting and [Data security and sovereignty](data_sovereignity.mdx) to understand how your data is stored by the agent.
