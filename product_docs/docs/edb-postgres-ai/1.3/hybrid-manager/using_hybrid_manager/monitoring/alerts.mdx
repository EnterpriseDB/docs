description: Learn about monitoring and alerts with Hybrid Manager.
---

Alerting is integral to the Hybrid Manager (HM) observability ecosystem, which proactively notifies about critical events that impact the performance of the Postgres cluster. It continuously monitors essential performance metrics and triggers alerts whenever predefined thresholds are exceeded. This robust alerting system integrates seamlessly into the HM ecosystem, leveraging real-time data collected from Postgres clusters and their infrastructure across all regions. Alerts are enabled by default for each project created in HM.

The alerting system ensures timely notifications through intuitive notifications, allowing for quick and informed actions. Comprehensive alert configuration options allow specific thresholds and intervals to be configured to customize the alerting experience. This seamless integration of monitoring and alerting offers complete visibility, enabling swift responses to potential issues and maintaining optimal cluster performance.

## View the alerts

You can access the alerts on the **Monitoring** tab of the cluster detail page and view the alert details for a specific cluster.

-  For HM clusters:

    1.   In the HM console, select **Projects**.
    1.   Select any project from the list.
    1.   In the left navigation, select **Clusters**.
    1.   Select any cluster with a ready state.
    1.   On the cluster detail page, select the **Monitoring** tab.

-  For external HM clusters:

    1.   In the HM console,  select **Estate**.
    1.   Go to the table listing all the clusters.
    1.   Select a ready cluster with Management as self-managed.
    1.   On the cluster detail page, select the **Monitoring** tab.

The **Monitoring** tab displays the Active Alerts list in a table. At the top of this tab, you can view a summary of the active alerts with their severity levels set to High, Medium, and Low.

You can search for specific alerts using the:

-   Search box for query-based search 
-   Date range selector for a specific date range-based search
-   Filter for a severity-level-based search
-   Sort utility to sort the alerts list based on severity, alert start time, and alert name
-   Refresh button to refresh the alerts list 
-   Column selector to select the columns to display in the table according to your preferences
-   Download button to download the alerts list in a CSV format

Select **Refresh** to manually refresh the alerts. The last refresh interval is displayed at the bottom of the alert table.

Select any nodes in the Node column to view the charts as they were when the alert was triggered. Selecting a node applies the filters in the **Monitoring** tab and displays the relevant charts.

**Download CSV** — You can download the alert details in CSV format using the Download button in the top-right corner. The CSV file includes these columns:

-   Alert Description
-   Start Time
-   Alert Severity
-   Metric Triggering the Alert
-   Node on which the alert has occurred
-   Alert Threshold
-   Cluster ID
-   Project ID

## Configure alerts

You can configure alerts at the project level. The project admins can configure the alerts. Once the alerts are configured and applied, the system requires a few minutes to fully process the alerts.

To configure alerts:

1.  At the top of the HM console, select **Projects**.
1.  Select any project from the list.
1.  In the left navigation, select **Settings**.
1.  Select **Alerts** to access/edit the alerts configuration.

For each alert, select the **Edit** button to:

-   Enable/Disable — To activate or deactivate a specific alert as required.
-   Notify After — To set the time duration after which the alert is triggered.
-   Threshold — To specify the percentage or values that will trigger an alert when they're exceeded.
