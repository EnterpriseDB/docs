With Hybrid Manager (HM), you can customize the types of notifications you want to receive. The two types of notification channels are:

**User notifications** &mdash; You can receive notifications via email, HM inbox, or both. These notifications are for all users who have enabled them and if their role allows it.

**System notifications** &mdash; You can receive notifications via email (mail group), webhook, pager duty, or any combination. These notifications are triggered once per event, primarily to automate tasks in your organization.

The user's role in HM determines the extent of their access to notification preferences. The notifications are categorized into the following preference sections:

-   Account &mdash; For user notification channels.
-   Global &mdash; For user and system notification channels.
-   Projects &mdash; For user and system notification channels.

The notifications under the Account preference section are:

-   New project role assigned to you
-   Project role unassigned from you
-   The personal access key is about to expire

The notifications under the Global preference section are:

-   New project created
-   The machine access key is about to expire

!!! note

    This section is visible only to the organization owner.

The notifications under the Projects preference section are:

-   Active cluster paused
-   Paused cluster reactivated

## Configuring notifications

Project owners/editors and organization owners/admins can enable/disable notifications for the events visible to them. They can receive notifications in the HM inbox, by email, or both.

Notification settings made by a user apply only to that user. If an email notification is enabled, the email is sent to the email address associated with the user's login.

System notification channels can be configured at the global level by the organization owner or at the project level by the project owner. By default, each organization's project inherits the global-level system notifications channel. However, you can enable/disable or reconfigure the system notifications channel at the project level to override the default settings.

### Configure notifications at the global level

Only the organization owner can set the global-level notifications.
