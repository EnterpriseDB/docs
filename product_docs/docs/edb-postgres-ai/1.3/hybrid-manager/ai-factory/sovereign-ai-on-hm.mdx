## What Sovereign AI means in Hybrid Manager

With **AI Factory on Hybrid Manager**, AI workloads are **co-located with your data**:

- **Your environment.** Assistants, model serving, and vector search run directly inside your Hybrid Manager project and Kubernetes cluster.
- **Your data.** Source documents, embeddings, and conversation history never leave your environment unless you explicitly configure it.
- **Your models.** Model images are curated in the Model Library and served from endpoints inside your cluster.
- **Your visibility.** Conversation threads and model logs are observable through the same platform you use for Postgres and analytics.

## Connectivity options

- **Standard (connected).** Most environments run with internet connectivity to pull container images, updates, or libraries. Even when connected, **data stays inside your project** — unlike SaaS AI, it is not shared with the provider.
- **Air-gapped.** For high-security deployments, Hybrid Manager can be operated without internet access. You preload model images and registries, and all workloads stay entirely within your controlled cluster.

## Contrast with external AI services

- **External LLM services** (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, Cohere): your prompts, documents, and embeddings leave your network and are processed in a third-party environment.
- **Hybrid Manager:** all retrieval, generation, and storage happen inside your project and infrastructure. Models are served next to your data, ensuring that sensitive content never leaves your control. Air-gapped deployments further guarantee that no external connectivity is required.
