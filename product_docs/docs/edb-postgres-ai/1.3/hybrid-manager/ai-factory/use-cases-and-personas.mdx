## Overview

AI Factory on Hybrid Manager enables diverse organizational use cases through sovereign AI infrastructure. Organizations leverage these capabilities to build intelligent applications while maintaining complete control over data and models within their Kubernetes environments.

## Key Use Cases

### Internal Knowledge Management

Organizations deploy AI assistants that provide employees with natural language access to internal documentation, policies, and institutional knowledge.

**Implementation Pattern**

Financial services firms index compliance documentation, regulatory filings, and internal procedures into knowledge bases. Employees query these systems using conversational interfaces, receiving accurate answers with source citations while maintaining data sovereignty.

**Technical Components**
- Knowledge bases indexing SharePoint, Confluence, and database content
- LLM endpoints for query understanding and response generation
- Retrieval systems with role-based filtering for access control

See [Knowledge Base Creation](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/create-knowledge-base) for implementation guidance.

### Customer Service Automation

AI-powered customer support systems handle routine inquiries while escalating complex issues to human agents.

**Implementation Pattern**

E-commerce companies deploy assistants that access order systems, product catalogs, and return policies through secure APIs. These assistants resolve 60-70% of customer inquiries automatically while maintaining full audit trails for quality assurance.

**Technical Components**
- REST API tools for order management system integration
- Knowledge bases containing product documentation and FAQs
- Thread tracking for conversation history and escalation workflows

See [Customer Service Agent Quickstart](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/quickstart-customer-service-agent-ui) for a working example.

### Enterprise RAG Systems

Retrieval-augmented generation applications ground LLM responses in organizational data, reducing hallucination while maintaining accuracy.

**Implementation Pattern**

Healthcare organizations implement RAG systems over clinical guidelines, research papers, and treatment protocols. Medical professionals receive evidence-based recommendations with citations to source materials, supporting clinical decision-making while ensuring traceability.

**Technical Components**
- Vector embeddings stored in PostgreSQL with pgvector
- Hybrid search combining semantic and keyword matching
- Reranking models for result optimization

See [RAG Pipeline Documentation](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/knowledge_base/) for detailed architecture.

### AI-Enabled APIs

Organizations expose AI capabilities through secure APIs for integration with existing applications.

**Implementation Pattern**

Software companies provide intelligent features within their products by deploying model endpoints accessible through standard REST interfaces. These APIs handle tasks like document summarization, sentiment analysis, and content generation while maintaining predictable performance characteristics.

**Technical Components**
- InferenceServices exposing OpenAI-compatible endpoints
- API gateways with authentication and rate limiting
- Load balancing across model replicas for high availability

See [Model Serving Guide](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/serving/) for deployment instructions.
