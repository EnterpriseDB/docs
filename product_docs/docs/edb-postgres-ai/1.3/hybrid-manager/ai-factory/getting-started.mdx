Hub quick links: [AI Factory Hub](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory) — [Gen AI](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/) — [Model Serving](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/serving/)

Hybrid Manager (HM) runs AI Factory workloads in a governed, Kubernetes-native project. Use this page to jump into the canonical hub docs with HM context.

What you can do in HM:

- Build assistants and agents: see [Gen AI (hub)](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/)
- Serve models with KServe: see [Model Serving (hub)](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/serving/)
- Create Knowledge Bases: see [Knowledge Base (hub)](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/knowledge_base/)

Next steps in HM:

- Enable AI Factory in your project — TODO: link to HM enablement runbook
