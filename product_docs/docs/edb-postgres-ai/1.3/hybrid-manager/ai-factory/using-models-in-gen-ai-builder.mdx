## How models are consumed

In Hybrid Manager, **Gen AI Builder** lets you build assistants that use model endpoints served from the [Model Library](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/library).

- When creating or editing an **Assistant**, you select which model to use (see [Create an Assistant](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/create-assistant)).
- Models available here are **governed by Hybrid Manager**: pulled from the Model Library, deployed to your project, and exposed via internal endpoints.
- This ensures that model calls stay within your environment — **no external API calls** are made by default.

## Knowledge Bases and pipelines

Knowledge Bases in Gen AI Builder can be populated with embeddings generated by **Pipelines**:

- Pipelines ingest and prepare documents into **vector indexes** (see [Vector Engine concepts](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/vector-engine/)).
- Knowledge Bases reference these pipelines, making them queryable for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
- Assistants then combine model responses with Knowledge Base retrievals to ground outputs in your organization’s data.

See: [Knowledge Bases (hub)](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/knowledge-bases/) and [Pipelines (hub)](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/).

## Environment and service discovery

When Gen AI Builder runs inside Hybrid Manager:

- **Service discovery** and **endpoints** are automatically managed by the platform.
- You do not need to configure external URLs; models appear directly in the Assistant creation UI.
- Any required **environment variables** (for service routing or authentication) are injected by HM.

This means you focus on building assistants — **Hybrid Manager takes care of wiring models, data, and observability together.**

## Common tasks

Use these how-tos from the hub to start building:

- [Create an Assistant](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/create-assistant)
- [Create a Knowledge Base](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/create-knowledge-base.mdx) and [Manage Knowledge Bases](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/manage-knowledge-base.mdx)
- [View threads](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/view-threads.mdx)

## Key takeaway

In Hybrid Manager, models and data are **co-located**:

- **Models**: deployed from the Model Library into your HM project.
- **Data**: ingested through pipelines, stored in Knowledge Bases.
- **Assistants**: combine both, with no traffic leaving your cluster.
