description: How Gen AI Builder is used within Hybrid Manager to develop agentic AI applications.
---

**Gen AI Builder** in **Hybrid Manager** enables you to build advanced **agentic AI applications** — fully aligned with your **Sovereign AI** architecture — with complete control over data, models, and application behavior.

Builder applications run as containers in your project’s Kubernetes cluster and interact with:

-   **KServe-powered Model Serving** endpoints
-   **Knowledge Bases** built in your Hybrid Manager project
-   **Tools** and **Structures** for executing business logic and accessing external systems

> For a deeper background, see the [Gen AI Builder concepts page](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/concepts) in the AI Factory hub and [Gen AI Builder hub reference](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai).

## Prerequisites

- Access to a Hybrid Manager project with AI Factory enabled and entitlements for Gen AI and Model Serving.
- A model endpoint available via /edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/serving/ or an approved external provider.
- Knowledge Base content prepared or accessible. See /edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/knowledge_base/.

## How Gen AI Builder works in Hybrid Manager

-   Gen AI Builder applications run in your project’s **Kubernetes cluster** — no external compute dependencies required.
-   Builders can call **models deployed via Model Serving** — see [Model Serving](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/serving/).
-   Builders retrieve content from **Knowledge Bases** built in your Hybrid Manager project — see [Knowledge Bases explained](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/concepts/explained).
-   Builders invoke **Tools** implemented within your project — see [Tools explained](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/reference/tools/).
-   Builders manage **Threads** to enable stateful, auditable conversations — see [Threads explained](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/threads/).
-   Builders can leverage **Rulesets** to enforce governance and behavioral consistency — see [Rulesets explained](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/rulesets/).

## Key Hybrid Manager considerations

-   Builder applications run on **GPU-enabled infrastructure** when required for high-performance inference — [Update GPU Resources](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/update-gpu-resources/).
-   Builders access **KServe-based Model Serving** endpoints deployed within your Hybrid Manager project — [Deploy AI Models](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/deploy-nim-container/).
-   Builders can access **Knowledge Bases** that are created within the project — see [AI Accelerator Knowledge Base page](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/knowledge_base/)
-   Builders operate entirely within your Hybrid Manager environment — supporting **Sovereign AI** principles:
-   Your data
-   Your models
-   Your AI pipelines
-   Full observability and control

See [Sovereign AI explained](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/concepts/sovereign-ai).

## Typical Gen AI Builder flow in Hybrid Manager

1.  Build or deploy **Tools** — [How-To: Create a Tool](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/reference/tools/).
2.  Create and configure **Knowledge Bases** — [How-To: Create a Knowledge Base](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder).
3.  Deploy supporting **models** via Model Serving — [How-To: Deploy a NIM container](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/deploy-nim-container/).
4.  Configure **Rulesets** as needed — [How-To: Create a Ruleset](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/rulesets/).
5.  Build **Assistants** and/or **agent workflows** using Gen AI Builder — [Gen AI Builder hub reference](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai).
6.  Monitor **Threads** and tune behavior — [How-To: View Threads](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/threads/).
