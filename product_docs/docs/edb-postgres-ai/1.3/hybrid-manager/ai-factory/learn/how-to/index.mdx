navTitle: AI Factory How-To
description: How-To Guides for using AI Factory features within Hybrid Manager projects — focused on deployment, configuration, and operations.
---

Use these **How-To Guides** to deploy and operate **AI Factory** capabilities inside your **Hybrid Manager (HCP)** environment.

Hybrid Manager runs AI Factory as an integrated AI workload inside your HCP Kubernetes project.
While many core concepts are shared with the [AI Factory Hub](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/ai-factory/learn/explained/), there are important **Hybrid Manager-specific patterns and steps** to follow when:

-   Setting up Model Serving infrastructure
-   Deploying and verifying AI models (InferenceServices)
-   Managing GPU resources for model serving
-   Using AI models in Gen AI applications and database extensions
-   Managing project- and user-scope permissions for AI Factory
