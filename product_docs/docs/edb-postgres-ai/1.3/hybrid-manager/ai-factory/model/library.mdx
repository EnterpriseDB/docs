description: How Asset Library works within Hybrid Manager and how to manage model images and AI assets.
---

The **Asset Library** in Hybrid Manager provides a central location for managing AI-related assets in your project. It replaces the prior **Model Library** and expands capabilities to include:

-   AI model images used in Model Serving.
-   Future support for additional AI artifacts (retrievers, embedding indexes, datasets).

You use the Asset Library to:

-   Discover and manage NVIDIA NIM Microservices available on build.nvidia.com.
-   Integrate and manage private registries.
-   Manage metadata and governance for model images.
-   Support project-scoped model deployment and versioning.

## How it fits in the Hybrid Manager architecture

-   Asset Library overlays the **Image Library** provided by Hybrid Manager.
-   All model images in Asset Library are backed by the project’s image repository and governance flow.
-   Images can be deployed to **KServe-based Model Serving** endpoints within the same project.
-   Asset Library is the central governance point for models used by:
-   Gen AI Builder Assistants.
-   AIDB Knowledge Bases (embedding models).
-   Custom AI pipelines and APIs.

Asset Library ensures that all models used in your AI Factory workloads are controlled, auditable, and deployed securely within your project’s Kubernetes infrastructure.

## Hybrid Manager considerations

-   Repository configuration is scoped to each project. You can configure different private registries per project.
-   The governance model follows Hybrid Manager controls, including image signing, provenance checks, and metadata tracking.

## Typical use cases

-   Deploy pre-integrated NVIDIA NIM Microservices available on build.nvidia.com (LLMs, embeddings, OCR, rerankers).
-   Add and manage organization-specific models from private registries.
-   Control which model versions are available for different AI Factory workloads.
-   Apply metadata and governance rules to track model usage and compliance.
