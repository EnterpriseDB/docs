The **AI Factory workload** in Hybrid Manager brings scalable AI, machine learning, and Gen AI capabilities to your Hybrid Manager platform. It enables you to operationalize AI across your Hybrid Manager–managed clusters and data — with deep integration across Postgres, vector search, model serving, and AI assistants.

With AI Factory in Hybrid Manager, you can:

-   Deploy Gen AI assistants and agents for internal or external-facing use
-   Serve AI models at scale with integrated KServe-powered inferencing and GPU acceleration
-   Create Knowledge Bases and perform Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with vector search
-   Manage your model library and deploy trusted models under Hybrid Manager governance
-   Integrate AI features directly into your applications and data pipelines

Hub quick links: [AI Factory Hub](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory) — [Gen AI (hub)](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/) — [Model Serving](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/serving/)

For in-depth architecture and core concepts, see the [AI Factory Hub](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/).

## Example AI solutions you can build

AI Factory in Hybrid Manager enables solutions across many domains:

-   Enterprise search and knowledge assistants
    Build RAG-based assistants that integrate with corporate documents, databases, and intranet content.

-   Customer support chatbots
    Deploy assistants powered by your own data and domain-specific models, combining conversational AI with Knowledge Bases.

-   AI-driven data apps
    Expose AI-powered endpoints for apps — semantic search, recommendations, similarity search, or natural language querying.

-   Operational AI for internal tools
    Build AI agents and tools to assist with DevOps, customer success, HR automation, sales enablement, and more.

-   Domain-specific model serving
    Serve proprietary or fine-tuned models (LLMs, embedding models, ranking models) as scalable inference services within your Hybrid Manager cluster.

You can start small — with a single assistant or model endpoint — and scale to full AI-powered applications using the AI Factory architecture.

## How AI Factory fits within Hybrid Manager

Hybrid Manager is the control plane for your databases, analytics, and AI workloads. AI Factory complements other HM capabilities:

-   Databases: Provision and manage Postgres clusters; AI Factory connects to these for vector search, RAG, and application endpoints.
-   Analytics: Offload data to Iceberg/Delta and query via SQL; AI Factory’s Pipelines and Vector Engine integrate with these datasets for retrieval.
-   Operations: Use HM observability and governance to monitor Gen AI, Pipelines, and model serving alongside databases and analytics.

Prerequisites for AI Factory in HM:

-   A Hybrid Manager project with AI Factory enabled and required entitlements for Gen AI, Pipelines, Vector Engine, and Model Serving.
-   Access to GPU resources where needed for serving. See [GPU resource management](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/setup-gpu).
