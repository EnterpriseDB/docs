The Hybrid Manager (HM) data catalog requires additional configuration to manage Lakehouse data storage. This involves creating a Kubernetes secret with a confounding key that the Lakekeeper service can use to store encrypted data.

## Creating a secret with the key

For EKS installations using the `eks-install-secrets.sh` script, you don't need to create a key and secret. In that case, skip this step and go to [Backing up the confounding key](#backing-up-the-confounding-key). 

Other EKS setups and operating systems require manual secret creation with the confounding key.

1.  Create a confounding key and store it in a variable:

    ```shell 
    PG_CONFOUNDING_KEY=$(dd if=/dev/urandom bs=32 count=1 2>/dev/null | base64)
    ```

    !!!note
    - A confounding key is a randomized string that's at least 32 bytes long.
    - Create a confounding key for each Hybrid Manager deployment. 
    !!!

1.  Create a namespace for the service: 

    ```shell
    kubectl create namespace upm-lakekeeper
    ```

1.  Create a secret that references the new confounding key and is stored in the dedicated namespace:

    ```yaml
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: Secret
      metadata:
        name: pg-confounding-key
        namespace: upm-lakekeeper
      stringData:
        PG_CONFOUNDING_KEY: ${PG_CONFOUNDING_KEY}
    EOF
    ```

    After you've configured the secret, continue with [Hybrid Manager installation](/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/install/).

## Backing up the confounding key

The Hybrid Manager administrator must keep the confounding key safe and back it up. 

!!! Warning
    The loss of the confounding key in a disaster scenario leads to a situation in which there's no mechanism for accessing the Lakehouse data managed by the Hybrid Manager data catalog. Instead, the administrator would have to create and store the new key, restart the `upm-lakekeeper`/`lakekeeper` workload, and rebuild all of the existing data catalogs carefully without deleting them. That procedure is very risky and would require support from EDB PG AI Professional Services team.    

Fetch the key:

```shell 
kubectl get secrets -n upm-lakekeeper pg-confounding-key -o yaml
```

Store the key safely.
