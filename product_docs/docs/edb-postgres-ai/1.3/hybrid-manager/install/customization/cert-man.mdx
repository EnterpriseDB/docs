## Set up a custom x.509 certificate for the Hybrid Manager Portal

You can change the self-signed x.509 certificate used by the Hybrid Manager (HM) Portal with your own.

To import your own certificate you need to create a Kubernetes secret containing the server certificate and the private key.

### Generate the certificate

Generate the base64 encoded string of your certificate (example: `my-certificate.crt`) and private key (example: `my-certificate.key`).

```bash
cat my-certificate.crt | base64
cat my-certificate.key | base64
```

### Create the yaml file

Create a file (example: `my-secret.yaml`) with the following content and replace `<base64 encoded string>` with the values generated in the previous step.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  tls.crt: <base64 encoded string>
  tls.key: <base64 encoded string>
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-portal-certificate
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    replicator.v1.mittwald.de/replicate-to: 'istio-system'
type: kubernetes.io/tls
```

### Apply the secret in your Kubernetes cluster

```bash
kubectl apply -n default -f ./my-secret.yaml
```

### Edit the Helm chart

Edit your Helm values.yaml file by adding the input variable `portal_certificate_secret` under `parameters.global`, setting its value to the name of the secret you have just created.

For example:

```yaml
parameters:
  global:
    portal_certificate_secret: "my-portal-certificate"
```

### Update the Helm chart

Run the Helm `upgrade` command to apply the changes on HM:

```bash
helm upgrade \
    -n edbpgai-bootstrap \
    --install \
    --f my-values.yaml
```

!!! Warning
Make sure you always provide the set of input variables you have used to install the Helm Chart.
If in a subsequent execution of the Helm upgrade command you don't specify one of the custom inputs, its value is going to be set to its default.
!!!

For more information on how the secret can be formatted, consult [Istio documentation](https://istio.io/latest/docs/reference/config/networking/gateway/#ServerTLSSettings-credential_name).

## Set up a custom cert-manager issuer for the HM Portal

The HM Portal's certificate can also be generated and managed using one of the x.509 issuers supported by HM's internal cert-manager, e.g. The ACME Issuer for Let's Encrypt certificates.

You can follow the documentation of the issuer of your choice directly from the cert-manager website to set it up.

!!! Note
We suggest to set up a ClusterIssuer rather than an Issuer. If you prefer to set up an Issuer, you need to create it in the istio-system namespace.
!!!

Once the ClusterIssuer is configured you can pass its name to HM by updating your `values.yaml` and run the Helm `upgrade` again.

The section that you need to edit in your `values.yaml` is:

```
parameters:
  global:
    portal_certificate_issuer_kind: "ClusterIssuer" # Valid values are Issuer and ClusterIssuer
    portal_certificate_issuer_name: "my-issuer" # Your Issuer name
```

Finally, run the Helm upgrade command to apply the changes on HM:


```bash
helm upgrade \
    -n edbpgai-bootstrap \
    --install \
    --f my-values.yaml
```

If you want to take advantage of this feature, make sure you don't set `parameters.global.portal_certificate_secret`.

!!! Warning
Make sure you always provide the set of input variables you have used to install the Helm Chart. If in a subsequent execution of the Helm upgrade command you don't specify one of the custom inputs, its value is going to be set to its default.
!!!

## Bring your own private certificate authority

By default, all the certificates used by HM are signed by an internal certificate authority (CA) powered by cert-manager. 
The CA is created at install time. 

If you prefer to use your own Private CA, follow the steps in this section. Otherwise, you can skip this section.

!!! Note
To successfully use this method you must have access to the CA private key.
!!!

Create one CA secret if it doesn't exist.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
data:
  ca.crt: <base64 encoded string> # real ca crt provided by customers
  tls.crt: <base64 encoded string> # real tls crt provided by customers
  tls.key: <base64 encoded string> # real tls key provided by customers
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-custom-ca
  namespace: default
  annotations:
    replicator.v1.mittwald.de/replicate-to: 'cert-manager'
type: kubernetes.io/tls
```

!!! Warning
You can change my-custom-ca to a name of your choosing, except `global-ca-secret`. 
Remember to be consistent with the name you have chosen when running the following commands.
!!!

You can run an helm upgrade to set the new CA, either by passing it via your values.yaml:

```
parameters:
  global:
    ca_secret_name: my-custom-ca
Or using the --set CLI argument:

```bash
helm upgrade \
    -n edbpgai-bootstrap \
    --install \
    ...
    --set parameters.global.ca_secret_name="my-custom-ca" \
    ...
```
