To verify that your installation of the EDB Postgres AI Hybrid Manager platform was successful, connect to Hybrid Manager Console using your browser.

```bash
https://portal.examplecompany.com
```

In this configuration, the https doesn't validate, as the hostname doesn't exist on the wider internet. Accept the certificate warning to proceed to the portal.

At the login screen, you can enter the username and password generated with the bootstrap installation. See [Managing users](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/managing_users/) for more information.

After you log in, you can [create a database cluster](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/cluster_management/create-clusters/) to get started.
