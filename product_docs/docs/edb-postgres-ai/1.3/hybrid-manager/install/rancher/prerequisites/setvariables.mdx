The HM cluster needs access to certain user domains during the installation.

## Set domain variables

```bash
export PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME=<portal domain name> # Customer domain name for the EDB Postgres AI Platform Portal
export TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME=<transporter rw service domain name> # Customer domain name for the EDB Postgres AI Platform Transporter RW Service
export BEACON_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME=<beacon service domain name> # Customer domain name for the EDB Postgres AI Beacon Service
export EXTERNAL_LB="lb.edbaiplatform.enterprisedb.network" # Only need this if using an external load balancer
```

## Set storage class variable

The HM cluster requires a predefined storage class:

```
export STORAGE_CLASS=<storage class> # Default storage class used
```

## Set authentication variables

Some authentication values are needed for installing HM:

```
export AUTHENTICATION_EMAIL=<email> # The email address of the user.
export AUTHENTICATION_HASH=<password hash>  # The hashed password of the user obtained for example as: echo "mypassword" | htpasswd -BinC 10 admin | cut -d: -f
export AUTHENTICATION_USERNAME=<Owner MyCompany> # The username of the user
export AUTHENTICATION_USER_ID="c5998173-a605-449a-a9a5-4a9c33e26df7" # A unique identifier for the user must not be changed since the first time installation.
```

## Optional: set FIPs mode Transporter Data Operator

Optionally, you can set FIPS mode for Transporter Data Operator:

```
export TRANSPORTER_FIPS_ENABLED=true # Enable FIPS mode for Transporter Data Operator
```
