Red Hat Open SHift has prerequisites to meet before you can install EDB Postgres AI Hybrid Manager (HM). Fulfill the prerequisites to ensure that you have everything you need before you start the installation process.

## Prerequisites

-   A system from which you can run the installation process:
    -   [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/) to manage your Kubernetes cluster
    -   [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/) to render and apply the Kubernetes manifest.
    -   [edbctl](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/edb-postgres-ai/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/edbctl/)
-   [A RKE2 cluster configured for use with HM](rke2cluster.mdx)
-   [Necessary environment variables set](setvariables.mdx)

## Next steps

Once you have fulfilled these requirements, you can move on to [installing the EDB Postgres AI Software Deployment on RHOS](../installing).
