Now that your Rancher RKE2 cluster has been mostly preconfigured to be ready for Hybrid Manager (HM) installation, you just need to confirm some essential values in the Helm chart `values.yaml`, and then execute and monitor the installation process.

## Final Helm chart preflight checks/final configurations

Before triggering the installation of HM, there are a few fields in the Helm chart `values.yaml` you must confirm for a successful installation process.

### containerRegistryURL

You should have already set your `containerRegistryURL` in your `values.yaml` during [image sync and preconfiguration](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#sync-container-images).
If you did not, do so now.

### bootstrapImageName and bootstrapImageTag
 
You should have already set your `bootstrapImageName` and `bootstrapImageTag` during [preconfiguration](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#configure-your-helm-chart).
If you did not, do so now.

### portal_domain_name

You should have already set your `parameters:global:portal_domain_name` during [preconifiguration](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#dns-tls-and-application-configuration).
If you did not, do so now.

### transporter-rw-service.domain_name

You should have already set your `parameters.transporter-rw-service.domain_name` during [preconfiguration](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#dns-tls-and-application-configuration).
If you did not, do so now.

### transporter-dp-agent:rw_service_url

You should have already set your `parameters.transporter-dp-agent:rw_service_url` during [preconfiguration](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#dns-tls-and-application-configuration).
If you did not, do so now.

### transporter-data-operator:fips_enabled

Leave this field set to `false` for the Transporter Data Operator, as we do not yet support FIPS for all HM components.

### upm-beacon:server_host

You should have already set your `parameters:upm-beacon:server_host` during [preconfiguration](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#dns-tls-and-application-configuration).
If you did not, do so now.

### upm-istio-gateway:cooke_aeskey

You should have already set your `parameters:upm-beacon:server_host` during [preconfiguration](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#dns-tls-and-application-configuration).
If you did not, do so now.

### upm-istio-gateway:cookie_aeskey

You should have already set your `parameters:upm-istio-gateway:cookie_aeskey` during [preconfiguration](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#update-the-helm-chart).
If you did not, do so now.

### pgai:portal:authentication:staticPasswords

You must set your `pgai:portal:authentication:staticPasswords:` `email`, `hash`, `username`, and `userID` before moving on to the installation process.

If using your own IDP, you should have already set your `pgai:portal:authentication:staticPasswords` values during [preconfiguration](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#user-identity-configuration).
If you did not, do so now.

If using a native HM user approach (user0), you should have already set these values during [preconfiguration](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#user-identity-configuration)
If you did not, do so now.

## beaconAgent:provisioning:nodePortDomain

You should have already set your `beaconAgent:provisioning:nodePortDomain` during [preconfiguration](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#load-balancer-or-node-port-configuration).
If you did not, do so now.

## Helm chart install

With all preflights checked, use the following command to start the installation process
```bash
helm upgrade \
    -n edbpgai-bootstrap \
    --install \
    -f ./values.yaml \
    --version "${EDBPGAI_BOOTSTRAP_HELM_CHART_VERSION}" \
    edbpgai-bootstrap enterprisedb-edbpgai/edbpgai-bootstrap
```

### Monitoring the installation process

Use the following command to monitor the installation process:

```yaml
kubectl get hybridcontrolplane edbpgai -o yaml
```

Once installation is complete, move on to updating your [DNS zone record](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/dns_and_verify/).
