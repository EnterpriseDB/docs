Now that your Rancher RKE2 cluster has been mostly preconfigured to be ready for Hybrid Manager (HM) installation, you just need to confirm some essential values in the Helm chart `values.yaml`, and then execute and monitor the installation process.

## Final Helm chart preflight checks/final configurations

Before triggering the installation of HM, there are a few fields in the Helm chart `values.yaml` you must confirm for a successful installation process.

### containerRegistryURL

You should have already set your `containerRegistryURL` in your `values.yaml` during [preconfiguration](product_docs/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#set-the-containerregistryurl-in-your-helm-chart)
If you did not, do so now.

### bootstrapImageName and bootstrapImageTag

You should have already set your `bootstrapImageName` and `bootstrapImageTag` during [preconfiguration](product_docs/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#initial-configuration-of-the-helm-chart).
If you did not, do so now.

### portal_domain_name

You should have already set your `bootstrapImageTag:global:portal_domain_name` during [preconifiguration](product_docs/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#dns-tls-and-application-configuration).
If you did not, do so now.

### transporter-rw-service:domain_name

You should have already set your `bootstrapImageTag:transporter-rw-service:domain_name` during [preconfiguration](product_docs/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#dns-tls-and-application-configuration).
If you did not, do so now.

### transporter-dp-agent:rw_service_url

You should have already set your `bootstrapImageTag:transporter-dp-agent:rw_service_url` during [preconfiguration](product_docs/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#dns-tls-and-application-configuration). 
If you did not, do so now.

### transporter-data-operator:fips_enabled

Leave this field set to `false` for the Transporter Data Operator, as we do not yet support FIPS for all HM components.

### upm-beacon:server_host

You should have already set your `bootstrapImageTag:upm-beacon:server_host` during [preconfiguration](product_docs/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#dns-tls-and-application-configuration).
If you did not, do so now.

### upm-istio-gateway:cooke_aeskey

You should have already set your `bootstrapImageTag:upm-beacon:server_host` during [preconfiguration](product_docs/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#dns-tls-and-application-configuration).
If you did not, do so now.

### upm-istio-gateway:cookie_aeskey

You should have already set your `bootstrapImageTag:upm-istio-gateway:cookie_aeskey` during [preconfiguration](product_docs/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#update-the-helm-chart).
If you did not, do so now.

### pgai:portal:authentication:staticPasswords

You must set your `pgai:portal:authentication:staticPasswords:` `email`, `hash`, `username`, and `userID` before moving on to the installation process.

For using native users, 

If using your own IDP, you should have already set your `pgai:portal:authentication:staticPasswords` values during [preconfiguration](http://product_docs/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#idp-setup).
If you did not, do so now.

If using a native HM user approach (user0), you should have already set these values during  

## beaconAgent:provisioning:nodePortDomain

You should have already set your `beaconAgent:provisioning:nodePortDomain` during [preconfiguration](product_docs/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/install/rancher/prerequisites/rke2cluster/#load-balancer-or-node-port-configuration).
If you did not, do so now.
