Hybrid Manager (HM) provides orchestration, observability, and lifecycle operations for Postgres, analytics, and AI workloads across cloud and on-premises deployments.

This section provides installation guidance for users deploying HM on their own infrastructure, across supported Kubernetes platforms. 
If you're using a turnkey hardware system like [Sovereign AI and Data Factory](../system), Hybrid Manager is preinstalled and requires no setup.

## Before you install

HM requires a Kubernetes environment and access to platform-specific APIs for managing storage, networking, and node pools.

You can install HM on:

- RedHat OpenShift clusters
- Rancher RKE2 clusters
- Cloud-managed Kubernetes (EKS, GKE)

Make sure to:

- Review system resource and storage requirements
- Choose a supported Postgres distribution (Advanced Server, Extended Server, PostgreSQL)
- Define access and RBAC requirements for your organization
