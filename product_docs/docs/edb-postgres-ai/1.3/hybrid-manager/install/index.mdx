## Overview

---

This guide walks you through planning, configuring, and installing Hybrid Manager (HM) onto your infrastructure.

The process is divided into **6 chronological phases** to ensure dependencies are met before deployment proceeds.

!!! Note
Please follow these phases in order. Skipping steps—particularly in [Gathering your system requirements](sys_reqs) or [Preparing your environment](environment_prep) are the most common cause of installation failure.
!!!

---

## Phase 1: Planning your architecture

> **Role focus:** CTO / Architect / Lead Engineer

This initial phase is about **designing** your deployment architecture. 

It concludes with documenting that architecture (Architectural Decision Record (ADR)), which then serves as the blueprint for all subsequent steps.

* **Goal:** Define the foundational architecture for Hybrid Manager.

* **Key activities:**

    * Review and select the appropriate **Kubernetes flavor**, topology, and deployment locations.

    * Document architectural decisions (ADR) as inputs for infrastructure requirements and Kubernetes installation (Phases 2 and 3).

* **Documentation:** [Planning your architecture](planning_arch)

!!! Note
You, as the customer, ultimately own your deployment architecture.
While EDB's Sales Engineering, Professional Services, Support Team, or documentation can be consulted, the final architectural decisions rest with your team.
!!!

## Phase 2: Gathering your system requirements

> **Role focus:** Infrastructure engineer / CSP Administrator / Platform Engineer

This phase focuses on **identifying, preparing, and verifying** the infrastructure needed to support the architecture defined in Phase 1. 
This is where you begin preparing your configuration.

* **Goal:** Fulfill all prerequisites and prepare the inputs for the core configuration file (`values.yaml`).

* **Key Activities:**

    * Identify **hardware, networking, storage, DNS requirements, and other system requirements** for your chosen architecture.

    * Ensure all prerequisites are met for Kubernetes deployment.

    * Prepare to populate critical entries in the **`values.yaml`** file for Hybrid Manager.

* **Documentation:** [Gathering your system requirements](sys_reqs.mdx)

!!! Note
EDB's Sales Engineering and Professional Services are the primary resources for communicating and clarifying detailed deployment requirements during the sales cycle or via a Statement of Work (SoW). 
The official documentation also provides comprehensive checklists.
!!!

---

## Phase 3: Deploying your Kubernetes cluster

---

> **Role focus:** Kubernetes engineer / CSP Administrator

This phase executes the deployment of your chosen Kubernetes environment based on the previous planning.

* **Goal:** Deploy and provision the operational Kubernetes cluster.

* **Key activities:**

    * Deploy Kubernetes according to the defined architecture and infrastructure requirements.

    * Implement necessary abstractions (node pools, storage classes, networking).

    * Validate that infrastructure requirements are met and update critical `values.yaml` entries.

* **Documentation:** [Deploying your Kubernetes cluster](k8s_install.mdx)

!!! Note
**EDB support context:** Customers own the installation and lifecycle operation of their Kubernetes cluster. 
Professional Services can be engaged via a Statement of Work (SoW), and Support can offer assistance through knowledge base articles.
!!!

---

## Phase 4: Preparing your environment

---

> **Role focus:** Site reliability engineer (SRE) / Infrastructure Engineer

Final preparations are made here to ensure the cluster is optimally configured to receive and run Hybrid Manager.

* **Goal:** Provision necessary security and configuration resources.

* **Key activities:**

    * Provision essential **secrets and configuration resources** as specified in `values.yaml`.

    * Perform further validation of cluster readiness for Hybrid Manager installation.

* **Documentation:** [Preparing your environment](environment_prep)

!!! Note
**EDB Support Context:** Final preparation for Hybrid Manager is primarily the **customer's responsibility** (except for Engineered Systems), as is the cluster's lifecycle operation. **Professional Services** can be engaged via a Statement of Work (SoW), and **Support** can offer assistance through knowledge base articles.
!!!

---

## Phase 5: Installing Hybrid Manager

---

> **Role focus:** Site reliability engineer (SRE) / Infrastructure Engineer

This is the final deployment step, where Hybrid Manager is installed into your prepared environment.

* **Goal:** Deploy Hybrid Manager and confirm successful operation.

* **Key activities:**

    * Final validation of the environment and deployment settings.

    * Deploy Hybrid Manager using customized `values.yaml` entries.

    * Confirm successful installation and operational readiness.

* **Documentation:** [See Hybrid Manager Installation](hm_install.mdx)

!!! Note
**Deployment responsibility:** Installation of Hybrid Manager is optimally executed by the **customer's SRE team**, and the customer owns its lifecycle operation. If you are using an EDB managed service (CX), the EDB CX team executes the HM install. **Professional Services** and **Sales Engineering** can also be engaged for assistance, and **Support** has knowledge base articles available.
!!!

---

## Phase 6: Exploring your post-installation options

---

> **Role focus:** Infrastructure Engineer/Platform Administrator

Once the system is running, this phase covers the "Day 2" configurations required to unlock advanced features like AI workloads, external monitoring, and migration assistance.

* **Goal:** Integrate the platform with your wider ecosystem and enable optional modules.

* **Key activities:**

    * **AI Capabilities:** Connect S3 buckets and Fernet keys to enable the GenAI Builder.

    * **Observability:** Configure notification channels (PagerDuty, Email) and install agents for external database monitoring.

    * **Migration:** Enable Migration Co-pilot to assist with schema conversion.

* **Documentation:** [See Post-installation options](post_install.mdx)

## Configuring HM

Several detailed configuration SOPS are referenced throughout the installation procedure and are either useful or necessary to consult for specific instructions:

1. Syncing images
1. Configuring image discovery
1. Enabling KMS for TDE
