You can install Hybrid Manager (HM) on [Amazon EKS](https://aws.amazon.com/eks/) using Helm and the bootstrap kit.

!!! Important

    Complete the [prerequisites](../prerequisites) before you start this part of the installation process.

## Set the version to install

The version of the EDB Software Deployment platform is set by the environment variable EDB_PLATFORM_VERSION. This should be set to the version of the platform you wish to install. For example, to install version v1.2.0, you would set the environment variable as follows:

```shell
export EDB_PLATFORM_VERSION="v1.2.0"
```

## Set your token

This installation process requires that you save your EDB subscription token as an environment variable. You can obtain it by going to your [EDB Account Profile](https://www.enterprisedb.com/accounts/profile). (Log in if prompted to.) There you will find an entry for Repos 2.0 token:

![Repo Token](../../../images/repo-token.png)

Take this value and set it as an environment variable:

```shell
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN="your-token"
```

## Obtain the bootstrap kit

Hybrid Manager is installed using a bootstrap kit. This kit is a collection of scripts and Helm charts that are used to install the EDB Software Deployment platform.

-   [eks-install-secrets.sh](assets-helm/eks-install-secrets.sh)
-   [prepare.sh](assets-helm/prepare.sh)
-   [default-env.sh](assets-helm/default-env.sh)

Copy all files to a directory on your local machine and `cd` into that directory.

## Install secrets

The bootstrap process requires a number of secrets to be installed in the Kubernetes cluster. These secrets are used to authenticate with the EDB Download Repository and to store the credentials for the EDB Software Deployment platform.

to install the secrets required for the bootstrap process, run the `install-secrets.sh` script. (As you already set the token as an environment variable, you can pipe it into the script.)

```shell
echo $EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN | $SHELL eks-install-secrets.sh
```

```console
Enter the password for pgai-platform@docker.enterprisedb.com
Creating secret edb-cred
namespace/upm-replicator configured
secret/edb-cred configured
namespace/edbpgai-bootstrap configured
secret/edb-cred configured
secret/edb-cred annotated
PG_CONFOUNDING_KEY is 01234567890123456789ABCDEFG - store safely
Installation completed
```

This process creates secrets needed for Hybrid Manager to run. You can find out more about these secrets in:

-   **[A secret for Griptape and DeltaLake object storage configuration](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/install/customization/genai_secret/) (optional for GenAI Builder)**

-   **[A secret for Catalog](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/install/customization/data_catalog_secret/) (optional for using Catalog)**

-   See also **[custom secrets for Migration Portal](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/install/customization/migration_portal_secrets/) (optional to secure internal communications with Migration Portal)**

## Prepare the values file

The bootstrap process requires a number of values to be set in the Helm chart. These values are stored in a file called `values.yaml`. You can create this file by running the `prepare.sh` script, which uses variables from the `default-env.sh` file. Edit the `default-env.sh` file to set the values you require.

This is the default `default-env.sh` file:

```shell
# exports for EKS
export EDB_PLATFORM_VERSION="v1.2.0"
export EDB_TARGET_PLATFORM="eks"
export CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URI="docker.enterprisedb.com/pgai-platform"
export IMAGESET_REGISTRY_URI=$CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URI
export IMAGESET_AUTHTYPE="token"
export PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME="portal.foo.network"
export TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME="transporter.foo.network"
export BEACON_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME="beacon.foo.network"
export AUTHENTICATION_EMAIL="owner@mycompany.com"
export AUTHENTICATION_USER="owner@mycompany.com"
export LOCATION_NAME="default-location"

# Set a password hash for the user or pass a password to have it hashed for you.
# If you pass a password, you will need to remove it from your history.
# You can hash a password using the following command:
# echo -n "password" | htpasswd -BinC 10 admin | cut -d: -f2
#

#export AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD="password"
export AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD_HASH="$2y$10$vKOAXfLHbeV1OQxMpxlLdOIwnX.JAN.ZrD9ZU//ocrNQwhQIMtXhy"
```

Here is a brief guide to the variables in the `default-env.sh` file.

| Variable                           | Description                                                                                                                                |

!!!note Recommendations for PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME and TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME

    For consistency and ease of management, derive your TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME from your PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME. The most common approach is to replace the `portal` subdomain with `dms`.

    The following table illustrates this relationship using a variety of examples based on the top-level domain `examplecompany.com`.

    | PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME                       | TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME            |
    |------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
    | portal.examplecompany.com                | dms.examplecompany.com                |
    | portal-dev.examplecompany.com            | dms-dev.examplecompany.com            |
    | portal.hm001.examplecompany.com          | dms.hm001.examplecompany.com          |
    | portal-hm-us-east-001.examplecompany.com | dms-hm-us-east-001.examplecompany.com |


<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Automatically">

Run the `prepare.sh` script to create the `values.yaml` file.

```shell
$SHELL prepare.sh
```

This create a `values.yaml` file with the values set in the `default-env.sh` file.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Manually">

Install the Helm chart repo with the following command:

```shell
helm repo add edbpgai "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/${EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN}/pgai-platform/helm/charts"
```

Once the charts repository is added, ensure it is up to date:

```shell
helm repo update
```

Now you can create the `values.yaml` file from the helm repo using the following command:

```shell
helm show values edbpgai/edbpgai-bootstrap > values.yaml
```

You now have a `values.yaml` file with the chart's default values for the bootstrap process.

You need to create two values for the bootstrap process. These are the AES_256_KEY and the AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD_HASH. You can create these values with the following commands:

```shell
export AES_256_KEY=$(openssl rand -base64 32)
```

If you have a password to hash, you can do so with the following command:

```shell
export AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD_HASH=$(echo -n $AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD | htpasswd -BinC 10 admin | cut -d: -f2)
```

You now need to edit `values.yaml` file and set the values required for your installation. Find the appropriate key in the `values.yaml` file and set the values as follows. Replace `$<name>` entries with the value you have set the environment variables of the same name to.

1.  Sets `bootstrapImageName` to $CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URI followed by "/edbpgai-bootstrap/bootstrap-" and then $EDB_TARGET_PLATFORM. eg, given the values above, this would be `docker.enterprisedb.com/pgai-platform/edbpgai-bootstrap/bootstrap-eks`.
2.  Set `bootstrapImageTag` to $EDB_PLATFORM_VERSION.
3.  Set `parameters.upm-istio.cookie_aeskey` to $AES_256_KEY.
4.  Set `containerRegistryURL` to $CONTAINER_REGISTRY_URI.
5.  Set `system` to $EDB_TARGET_PLATFORM.
6.  Set `parameters.global.portal_domain_name` to $PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME.
7.  Set `parameters.transporter-rw-service.domain_name` to $TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME.
8.  Set `parameters.transporter-dp-agent.rw_service_url` to `https://` followed by $TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME followed by `/transporter`. Following the first of the previously provided examples, this would be `https://dms.examplecompany.com/transporter`.
9.  Set `parameters.upm-beacon.server_host` to $BEACON_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME.
10. Set `pgai.portal.authentication.staticPasswords[0].email` to $AUTHENTICATION_EMAIL.
11. Set `pgai.portal.authentication.staticPasswords[0].hash` to $AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD_HASH.
12. Set `pgai.portal.authentication.staticPasswords[0].username` to $AUTHENTICATION_USER.
13. Set `pgai.portal.authentication.staticPasswords[0].userID` "c5998173-a605-449a-a9a5-4a9c33e26df".
14. Set `beaconAgent.location` to $LOCATION_NAME

## Apply the Helm chart

With the `values.yaml` file prepared, you can apply the Helm chart to start the bootstrap process. This create the necessary resources in the Kubernetes cluster to start the bootstrap process.

```shell
helm upgrade -n edbpgai-bootstrap \
   --install -f ./values.yaml \
   --version "${EDB_PLATFORM_VERSION/-appl/+appl}" \
   edbpgai-bootstrap edbpgai/edbpgai-bootstrap
```

This command installs the bootstrap container in the Kubernetes cluster. The bootstrap container then installs the rest of the EDB Software Deployment platform.

## Follow the bootstrap process

The bootstrap process takes time to complete. You can follow the progress by looking at the logs of the bootstrap container:

```shell
kubectl logs -f -l app=edbpgai-bootstrap -n edbpgai-bootstrap
```

## Configure host name resolution

Obtain the IP address of your ingress gateway. Run:

```shell
kubectl -n istio-system get service istio-ingressgateway -o jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].hostname}' | strings | nslookup
```

This command returns output like:

```console
Server:         192.168.111.1
Address:        192.168.111.1#53

Non-authoritative answer:
Name:   k8s-istiosys-istioing-b3dc9b4f3c-81dc5c45b1d5f6d2.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com
Address: 52.70.180.102
```

You now need to configure your DNS service or your `/etc/hosts` file to point the domains specified in `default-env.sh` to the IP address you obtained from the command above. Those domains are in `PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME`, `TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME`, and `BEACON_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME`. In the example above, they are set to `portal.examplecompany.com`, `dms.examplecompany.com`, and `beacon.examplecompany.com` respectively. 

### Configure DNS

In your DNS configuration, create a CNAME record for each of these domains that points to the IP address you obtained. So for our example, you would create the following records in your DNS zone file for `examplecompany.com`:

```text
cluster IN A 52.70.180.102
portal      IN CNAME cluster.examplecompany.com
transporter IN CNAME cluster.examplecompany.com
beacon      IN CNAME cluster.examplecompany.com
```

This is a simplified example. The actual configuration will depend on your DNS provider and how you manage your DNS records.

### Configure `/etc/hosts` (if no DNS service)

If you don't have a DNS service configured, consider adding the IP address to your local `/etc/hosts` file. This addition allows you to access Hybrid Manager Console using the domain name you set in the `default-env.sh` file.

You can then add the IP address to your `/etc/hosts` file like this:

```shell
echo "52.70.180.102 portal.examplecompany.com dms.examplecompany.com beacon.examplecompany.com" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts
```

Substitute the IP address with the value you obtained earlier. This is a temporary solution and should not be used in production environments. We recommend that you use a proper DNS service for production deployments. The settings in the `/etc/hosts` file work only on the machine where you set them.

## Next steps

You can now verify the installation by [connecting to the HM Console](../portalconnection.mdx).
