Uninstalling Hybrid manager from an EKS cluster is dependent on how you installed it.

## Uninstalling a Hybrid Manager installed using the Bootstrap Helm chart

It is not possible to uninstall a Hybrid Manager installed using the Bootstrap Helm chart. You will need to delete the EKS cluster itself to remove Hybrid Manager and all associated resources.

## Uninstalling a Hybrid Manager installed using the Hybrid Manager Operator

To uninstall the Hybrid Manager Operator installation, you can run the following commands:

```bash
# by default, EDB Postgres AI is protected from the deletion, disable the protection first
kubectl annotate hybridcontrolplane edbpgai biganimal.enterprisedb.io/deletion-protect=disabled --overwrite
# uninstall the EDB Postgres AI
kubectl delete hybridcontrolplane edbpgai --wait=false
# monitor the uninstallation process
kubectl get hybridcontrolplane edbpgai -o yaml
```

This will remove the Hybrid Manager Operator and all associated resources from your EKS cluster.

## Post uninstallation

Note that after uninstalling Hybrid Manager, your EKS cluster still retains resources created as a side effect of the installation. 
You can remove these resources manually if you no longer need them, keep them for future use, or delete the EKS cluster itself, which will remove all resources associated with it.
