| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhancement | The bootstrap stack now allows users to set the default backup compression status and the backup retention period (default: 30 days) directly at the time of installation. This provides control over internal storage consumption and data lifecycle policies. |
| Enhancement | Added a new `org.enterprisedb.operandset.version` annotation to improve release tracking and reporting. Also configured the `beacon-agent` service to send the annotation to the `beacon-server`.                                                               |
| Enhancement | Implemented new `ImageLibrary` filtering logic to improve performance by limiting the number of images pulled, and updated the Helm chart configuration to correctly propagate these filters during installation.                                               |
| Bug fix     | Added a fix to the `spire-agent` component which caused a connection error with the kubelet in RHOS deployments.                                                                                                                                                |
| Bug fix     | Added a fix to `kube-state-metrics` which prevented the service from exporting custom metrics.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Bug fix     | Added a fix that caused `beacondb` backups to fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Bug fix     | Added a fix for the `barman-plugin-v0-8-0-migrator` plugin which caused issued in RHOS deployments.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Bug fix     | Fixed an issue that caused errors when configuring the Hybrid Manager to use a custom certificate issuer.                                                                                                                                                       |
