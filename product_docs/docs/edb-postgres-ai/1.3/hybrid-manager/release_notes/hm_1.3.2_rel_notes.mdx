| Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue where backup retention and compression settings couldn't be changed during installation. Users can now define the `internal_db_backup_compression` and `internal_db_backup_retention` (defaulting to 30 days) during installation, preventing issues with uncontrolled internal storage consumption and data lifecycle policies. |
| Bug fix | Corrected `beacon-agent` configuration to include missing release annotations. The `org.enterprisedb.operandset.version` is now properly sent to the `beacon-server` to fix release reporting inaccuracies.                                                                                                                                     |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue where the `ImageLibrary` pulled unnecessary images, resulting in degraded performance. Added filtering logic and corrected the Helm chart configuration to ensure these limits are properly applied during installation.                                                                                                         |
| Bug fix | Added a fix to the `spire-agent` component which caused a connection error with the kubelet in RHOS deployments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Bug fix | Added a fix to `kube-state-metrics` which prevented the service from exporting custom metrics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Bug fix | Added a fix that caused `beacondb` backups to fail.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Bug fix | Added a fix for the `barman-plugin-v0-8-0-migrator` plugin which caused issues in RHOS deployments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue that caused errors when configuring the Hybrid Manager to use a custom certificate issuer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Bug fix | Corrected sorting behavior for AI Models, allowing users to sort by name in descending order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Bug fix | Resolved filtering issues in the **Estate** table, ensuring accurate results when applying filters to PostgreSQL databases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Bug fix | Resolved button visibility for the **Delete** and **Dismiss** buttons on Migration Portal, ensuring these actions are now correctly restricted based on user permissions.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Bug fix | Resolved an issue preventing PGD Knowledge Bases from displaying in the GenAI Builder interface.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
