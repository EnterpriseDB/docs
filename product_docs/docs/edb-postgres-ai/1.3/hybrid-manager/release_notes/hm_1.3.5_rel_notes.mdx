| Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Resolved various upstream stability issues in Spark Connect by upgrading to version 3.5.8. This update incorporates critical fixes and stability improvements into HM Analytics to improve platform performance.                                                       |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where replicas could fail to start after a system database major version upgrade. The system now correctly differentiates between WAL files from the old and new timelines in object storage, preventing startup crashes caused by timeline divergence. |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | The internal statistics database (`stats-db`) no longer performs backups. This change optimizes storage and resource usage, as the telemetry data stored here is transient and not critical for Disaster Recovery.                                                     |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | The statistics collector has been patched to properly decode `query_text`, ensuring compatibility and reliable metric collection across different versions of the HM agent.                                                                                            |
