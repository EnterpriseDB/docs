[will be removed prior to release] |

| Enhancement  | The internal Spark Connect integration has been updated to version 3.5.8. This backport ensures the Analytics platform remains aligned with upstream Apache Spark maintenance releases, incorporating recent fixes and stability improvements.                         | BEAC-1007, BEAC-1000                        |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where replicas could fail to start after a system database major version upgrade. The system now correctly differentiates between WAL files from the old and new timelines in object storage, preventing startup crashes caused by timeline divergence. | UPM-77158                                   |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | The internal statistics database (`stats-db`) no longer performs backups. This change optimizes storage and resource usage, as the telemetry data stored here is transient and not critical for Disaster Recovery.                                                     | UPM-76597                                   |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | The statistics collector has been patched to properly decode `query_text`, ensuring compatibility and reliable metric collection across different versions of the HM agent.                                                                                            | UPM-76095                                   |
