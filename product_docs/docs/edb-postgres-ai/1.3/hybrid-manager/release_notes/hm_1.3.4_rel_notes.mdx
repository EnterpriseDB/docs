| Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhancement  | Improved automated WAL retention and cleanup for Postgres\* clusters. To ensure that Write-Ahead Logs (WAL) are correctly pruned from object storage, HM now utilizes barman-cloud as the default scheduled backup method for newly created Advanced High Availability and Distributed High Availability (PGD) clusters. For existing clusters and newly created Single Node, High Availability (PSR), or Analytics clusters, HM now automatically performs periodic Barman backups alongside volume snapshots. |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where creating a model cluster with an invalid name (such as one containing spaces) resulted in a generic 500 error. The HM console now validates the model cluster name during input to prevent spaces. Additionally, HM now correctly returns a 400 error with a descriptive message if an invalid name is provided.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where image discovery failed when using a private Red Hat Quay registry in air-gapped environments. Previously, `upm-beacon-agent` couldn't successfully retrieve images even when configured with the correct registry URL and authentication tokens. This fix ensures that image discovery now works correctly for both secure and insecure private registries in restricted network environments.                                                                                             |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue in the `cnp_pg_replication_in_recovery` alert where Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs) were incorrectly mapped to pods. Previously, the alerting logic attempted to reuse pod names for PVCs, which caused failures for WAL volumes that used a `-wal` suffix. The monitoring logic now correctly uses `cnpg_instance_id` to join metrics, ensuring accurate replication recovery status and alerting for all volume types.                                                                         |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed a "missing module" error in the `upm-griptape` component. Previously, versions v1.5.16 and v1.7.6 of the `upm-griptape` service failed to start due to missing Python dependencies, specifically the `fastapi` module. This fix resolves the dependency conflicts and ensures all required modules are correctly bundled in the service image.                                                                                                                                                            |
