| Bug&nbsp;fix | AWS STS requests now correctly route to the regional endpoint when a VPC endpoint is in use, rather than defaulting to the global endpoint.                                                                                                                                   |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Introduced a Quick-Signin URL to allow users to navigate directly to the Identity Provider (IdP).                                                                                                     |
