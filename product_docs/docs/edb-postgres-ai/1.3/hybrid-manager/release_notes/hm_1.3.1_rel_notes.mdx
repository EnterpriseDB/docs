### HM console

| Type         | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bug&nbsp;fix | The total number of Postgres clusters on the HM console home page now correctly excludes individual cluster nodes (e.g., EFM or CNP replicas) to prevent inflated and inaccurate totals.                                                        |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where the database connection information in the HM console's **Connect** tab incorrectly displayed 'edb_admin' instead of the required 'bdrdb' for Advanced High Availability and Distributed High Availability (PGD) clusters. |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | The database size in the **Monitoring** tab of a cluster's detailed page now correctly displays storage metrics for self-managed clusters.                                                                                                      |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Tags are now correctly displayed for active clusters on the **Deployment Details** page of the HM console.                                                                                                                                      |

### Advanced High Availability and Distributed High Availability (PGD)

| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                           |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhancement | Corrected validation logic for `max_worker_processes` to ensure that GUC values for replica groups aren't incorrectly validated as lower than the primary group.      |
| Bug fix     | Fixed an issue where submitting an empty GUCs configuration payload didn't preserve the existing settings, instead incorrectly triggering a reset to default values.  |
| Bug fix     | Ensured that when duplicating a data group, the GUCs (such as `max_connections`) are properly included in the payload, preventing unnecessary validation failures.    |
| Bug fix     | Resolved a bug that prevented the successful addition of a new PGD group.                                                                                             |
| Bug fix     | Fixed an issue that could cause PGD-X cluster creation to stall during the reconcile phase.                                                                           |
| Enhancement | When adding a new PGD data group, the database settings are now correctly duplicated from the first data group to maintain consistency.                               |
| Enhancement | PGD cluster status visibility has been enhanced with new control plane resource (CR) status panels for cluster, clusterwrapper, and pgdgroup resources.               |
| Bug fix     | The console now correctly reflects the effective `max_wal_size` of 8 GB in the HM console, resolving a discrepancy where the console displayed 1024 MB.               |
| Enhancement | The required `shared_preload_libraries` setting for PGD now correctly includes pgaa, or the HM console provides appropriate indication when the setting is incorrect. |

### Backup, recovery & storage

| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bug fix     | Fixed a bug where cluster metadata wasn't completely removed after the retention period, leaving orphaned Barman files in S3/object storage. |
| Bug fix     | WAL files marked as completed are no longer incorrectly retained beyond the configured limits.                                               |
| Bug fix     | Resolved an issue with the upm-beacon agent component to stabilize the backup deletion process.                                              |
| Bug fix     | The spark-work PVC now correctly uses the storage class specified in `values.yaml` instead of defaulting to the system storage class.        |
| Enhancement | The cross-location cluster restore functionality now correctly uses pg_basebackup as the method.                                             |

### Core platform functionality & API

| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                 |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Bug fix     | Fixed a bug that caused the `accm-server` to crash due to an invalid pod name format.                                                       |
| Bug fix     | Resolved an issue that could prevent cluster creation due to upper bounds limits on EKS.                                                    |
| Bug fix     | Fixed a bug that prevented the secondary location beacon dispatcher runner from connecting to the primary beacon-server.                    |
| Enhancement | The **Model Profile Paths** field in the HM console is now correctly marked as optional during configuration.                               |
| Bug fix     | Fixed an API bug that caused certain status fields, such as BackupWrapper `status.backupStatus`, to appear empty.                           |
| Enhancement | Improved cluster metadata availability across the platform for enhanced reliability.                                                        |
| Bug fix     | Fixed an issue that caused an error when calling an LLM remotely, ensuring successful external API communication.                           |
| Bug fix     | Applied a vulnerability fix for the Prometheus operator.                                                                                    |
| Enhancement | Increased the default memory allocation for the beacon agent and server and made the limits configurable in the bootstrap values.           |
| Bug fix     | Fixed a bug where a process group would cease retrying to connect after an hour, ensuring continuous attempts for connection and stability. |
