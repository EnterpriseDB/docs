# install Hybrid Manager 

## operator install from Helm

With all preflights checked, use the following command to start the installation process
```bash
helm upgrade \
    -n edbpgai-bootstrap \
    --install \
    -f ./values.yaml \
    --version "${EDBPGAI_BOOTSTRAP_HELM_CHART_VERSION}" \
    edbpgai-bootstrap enterprisedb-edbpgai/edbpgai-bootstrap
```

Status
```bash
kubectl describe hcp edbpgai
kubectl logs hcp-operator -n edbpgai-bootstrap
```

### Retry of install

If at any time the install process is retried, the following actions are critical:
* Fernet secrets for upm-griptape and upm-lakekeeper must be reprovisioned as uninstall will remove the namespaces and therefore the secrets.
* The backup folder string is changed or the named backup folder per `parameters.global.internal_backup_folder` in your `values.yaml` 
```bash
kubectl delete hcp edbpgai
```

## operator install from OpenShift Container Platform Catalog

1. adapt values.yaml for OpenShift
1. deploy the operator via OpenShift Catalog
