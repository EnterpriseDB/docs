**Role:** Infrastructure Engineer / Platform Admin

**Prerequisites:**
* [Phase 5: Installing Hybrid Manager](../install) (Completed & Verified)
* Administrator access to the Hybrid Manager (HM) Portal.

**Outcome:** A fully configured HM environment with security integrations, AI capabilities, and monitoring enabled.

**Next Step:** [Using Hybrid Manager](../using_hybrid_manager)

---

Now that the HM Control Plane is running, you can enable optional but critical integrations. 
While the platform is functional without these, configuring them now ensures your environment is production-ready for security, AI workloads, and observability.

## 1. Security: Enable KMS for TDE

To protect sensitive data at rest, you can integrate HM with an external Key Management System (KMS). 
This allows you to enable **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)** on the Postgres clusters you provision.

**Supported Providers:**
* HashiCorp Vault
* AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
* Google Cloud Key Management

**Configuration Scope:**
KMS providers are configured at the **Project** level, allowing different teams to use different keys or providers.

* [**Guide: Configure KMS for TDE**](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/install/customization/kms_for_tde/)

## 2. AI Capabilities: Configure GenAI Builder

To unlock the AI features of the platform (such as Vector Databases and Model serving), you must connect an object storage bucket to the GenAI Builder.

**Requirements:**
* An S3-compatible bucket (AWS S3, MinIO, GCS, etc.).
* A Fernet key for encryption.

Once configured, this storage is used to persist vector data and AI model artifacts, enabling the "AI Factory" capabilities for your users.

---

## 3. Observability: Set Up Notifications

Ensure your team is alerted to critical events (such as cluster failovers, backup failures, or capacity issues). HM allows you to configure notification channels globally or per project.

**Supported Channels:**
* Email
* Webhooks (Slack, Microsoft Teams, generic JSON)
* PagerDuty

* [**Guide: Configure Notifications**](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/monitoring/notifications/)

---

## 4. Observability: Monitor External Databases

HM can monitor Postgres databases that it does not manage (e.g., RDS, self-managed EC2, or on-prem instances).

To enable this, you must install the **Beacon Agent** on the external database host. The agent collects metrics and logs, shipping them back to the HM control plane for centralized visualization.

* [**Guide: Monitor External Databases**](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/)

---

## 5. Migration: Enable Co-pilot

To use the AI-assisted **Migration Co-pilot**, you must apply specific secrets and configurations to the control plane. This feature assists in analyzing and converting schemas from legacy databases to EDB Postgres.

* [**Guide: Enable Migration Co-pilot**](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/enabling_migration_copilot/)

### Next Steps

Your HM platform is now fully deployed and integrated. You are ready to onboard users and begin provisioning clusters.
