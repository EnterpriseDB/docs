## Overview

This guide walks you through planning, configuring, and installing Hybrid Manager (HM) onto your infrastructure. 
Each of the 5 phases is designed to ensure a smooth, successful deployment.

---

### 1: Planning the architecture

> **Role focus**: CTO or architect

This initial phase is about **designing** your deployment architecture. 

It concludes with documenting that architecture, which then serves as the blueprint for all subsequent steps.

* **Goal:** Define the foundational architecture for Hybrid Manager.

* **Key activities:**
    * Review and select the appropriate **Kubernetes flavor**, topology, and deployment locations.
    * Document architectural decisions as inputs for infrastructure requirements and Kubernetes installation (Phases 2 and 3).

* **Documentation:** [See Architecture Guide](diagrams_architecture.mdx)

> **Ownership note**: Customers ultimately own their the deployment architectures**. 
While EDB's Sales Engineering, Professional Services, Support Team, or documentation can be consulted, the final architectural decisions rest with the customer team.

---

### 2: Meeting requirements

> **Role focus:** Infrastructure engineer, CSP administrator, or platform engineering

This phase focuses on **identifying, preparing, and verifying** the infrastructure needed to support the architecture defined in phase 1. 
This is where you begin preparing your configuration.

* **Goal:** Fulfill all prerequisites and prepare the core configuration file.

* **Key Activities:**
    * Identify **hardware, networking, storage, and DNS requirements** for your chosen architecture.
    * Ensure all prerequisites are met for Kubernetes deployment.
    * Prepare to populate critical entries in the **`values.yaml`** file for Hybrid Manager.

* **Documentation:** [See Requirements](requirements.mdx)

> **EDB Assistance Note:** EDB's Sales Engineering and Professional Services are the primary resources for communicating and clarifying detailed deployment requirements during the sales cycle or via a Statement of Work (SoW). The official documentation also provides comprehensive checklists.

[See Requirements](requirements.mdx)

### 3. Install Kubernetes cluster

> **Role focus:** Kubernetes engineer

This phase executes the deployment of your chosen Kubernetes environment based on the previous planning.

* **Goal:** Deploy and provision the operational Kubernetes cluster.

* **Key activities:**
    * Deploy Kubernetes according to the defined architecture and infrastructure requirements.
    * Implement necessary abstractions (node pools, storage classes, networking).
    * Validate that infrastructure requirements are met and update critical `values.yaml` entries.

* **Documentation:** [See Kubernetes Installation](k8s_install.mdx)

> **EDB support context:** Customers own the installation and lifecycle operation of their Kubernetes cluster. Professional Services can be engaged via a Statement of Work (SoW), and Support can offer assistance through knowledge base articles.

---

### 4. Prepare Kubernetes for hybrid manager

> **Role focus:** Site reliability engineer (SRE)

Final preparations are made here to ensure the cluster is optimally configured to receive and run Hybrid Manager.

* **Goal:** Provision necessary security and configuration resources.
* **Key activities:**
    * Provision essential **secrets and configuration resources** as specified in `values.yaml`.
    * Perform further validation of cluster readiness for Hybrid Manager installation.
* **Documentation:** [See Preparation of Kubernetes for Hybrid Manager Installation](hm_preparation.mdx)

> **EDB Support Context:** Final preparation for Hybrid Manager is primarily the **customer's responsibility** (except for Engineered Systems), as is the cluster's lifecycle operation. **Professional Services** can be engaged via a Statement of Work (SoW), and **Support** can offer assistance through knowledge base articles.

---

### 5. Install Hybrid Manager

> **Role focus:** Site reliability engineer (SRE)

This is the final deployment step, where Hybrid Manager is installed into your prepared environment.

* **Goal:** Deploy Hybrid Manager and confirm successful operation.
* **Key activities:**
    * Final validation of the environment and deployment settings.
    * Deploy Hybrid Manager using customized `values.yaml` entries.
    * Confirm successful installation and operational readiness.
* **Documentation:** [See Hybrid Manager Installation](hm_install.mdx)

> **Deployment responsibility:** Installation of Hybrid Manager is optimally executed by the **customer's SRE team**, and the customer owns its lifecycle operation. If you are using an EDB managed service (CX), the EDB CX team executes the HM install. **Professional Services** and **Sales Engineering** can also be engaged for assistance, and **Support** has knowledge base articles available.
