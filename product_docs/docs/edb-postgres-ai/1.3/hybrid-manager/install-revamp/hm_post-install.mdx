# Post-installation options

## Key Management System for Transparent Data Encryption

Enable a key management system to secure your data encryption keys. Hybrid Manager supports providers like HashiCorp Vault, Amazon Web Services Key Management Service, and Google Cloud Key Management. Configure your provider in the deployment settings to protect encrypted data at rest.  This is implemented per Project.

See the [KMS for Transparent Data Encryption guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/install/customization/kms_for_tde/).

## Configure GenAI Builder

To enable GenAI Builder, connect it to an S3-compatible storage bucket. Set up a Fernet key for encryption, then provide your bucket details in the Hybrid Manager console. This allows GenAI Builder to store and retrieve data for AI workloads.

See the [GenAI configuration instructions](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/ai-factory/how-to-enable-ai-factory/#3-connect-the-bucket-to-genai-builder).

## Set Up Notifications

Hybrid Manager can send notifications for events such as cluster status changes. Configure notification channels globally or per project, using email, webhook, or PagerDuty. Notification preferences can be managed in the console by organization and project owners.

See the [Notifications documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/monitoring/notifications/).

## Monitor External Databases

To monitor self-managed or external Postgres databases, install and configure the Beacon Agent on each host. The agent collects metrics and sends them to Hybrid Manager for observability and diagnostics. Follow the step-by-step guide to create users, configure the agent, and enable monitoring.

See the [external database monitoring guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/).
