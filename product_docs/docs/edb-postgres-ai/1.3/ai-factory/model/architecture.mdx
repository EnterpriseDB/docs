**Understanding EDB AI Factory's Model Library and LLM Serving Components**

This document provides a conceptual framework for understanding how Model Library and Model Serving components work together within AI Factory to deliver enterprise-grade Large Language Model (LLM) inference capabilities. Organizations implementing AI Factory require this architectural understanding to make informed decisions about LLM deployment strategies, resource allocation, and governance frameworks that align with their operational requirements and compliance obligations.

---

## Purpose and Scope

AI Factory's LLM serving architecture enables organizations to deploy and manage Large Language Models at scale while maintaining governance, security, and operational control. The system addresses the critical gap between experimental LLM development and production-ready inference services, where traditional approaches often fail to meet enterprise requirements for reliability, security, and compliance. Organizations benefit from reduced operational complexity, improved GPU resource utilization, and consistent policy enforcement across their entire LLM lifecycle. The architecture bridges the gap between LLM development and production deployment through two primary components: the Model Library for curation and the Model Serving infrastructure for runtime operations.

## Architectural Principles

### Separation of Concerns
The architecture distinguishes between LLM storage/curation (Model Library) and LLM execution (Model Serving), enabling independent scaling and management of each concern. This separation allows platform teams to optimize storage strategies without impacting running inference services, while AI teams can focus on LLM performance without worrying about underlying infrastructure complexity. Organizations experience improved system stability because failures in one component don't cascade to others, and teams can implement changes to curation policies or serving configurations independently based on their specific operational cycles.

### Governance Integration
Security and compliance controls are embedded throughout the LLM pipeline rather than added as afterthoughts, ensuring consistent policy enforcement from image ingestion to production inference. This approach eliminates the common problem of governance gaps that occur when security measures are applied retroactively to existing systems. Platform administrators benefit from centralized policy management that automatically applies to all LLMs, while compliance teams gain comprehensive audit trails and enforcement mechanisms that meet regulatory requirements without manual intervention.

### Resource Optimization
GPU resources and compute infrastructure are abstracted from individual LLM deployments, allowing efficient resource sharing and dynamic allocation based on workload demands. This abstraction prevents the common scenario where expensive GPU resources remain underutilized because they're statically allocated to specific LLMs. Organizations achieve significant cost savings through improved resource utilization while maintaining performance guarantees, and development teams benefit from simplified deployment processes that don't require detailed infrastructure knowledge.

## Control and Data Flow

```text
Container Registry → Image & Model Library → Model Library (curated)
                                 ↓
                           KServe (ServingRuntime)
                                 ↓
                        InferenceService endpoint
                       (internal & external access)
```

### Flow Components

1. **LLM Image Synchronization**: LLM container images are synchronized from registries into the Image & Model Library based on repository rules that define which repositories, tags, and LLM types to ingest
2. **Curation Process**: Model Library exposes a curated subset of those LLM images for serving through governed selection processes
3. **Deployment Configuration**: Operators select a ServingRuntime optimized for LLM frameworks and deploy an InferenceService with the chosen LLM image
4. **Access Management**: Applications invoke LLMs via internal DNS for cluster communication or external portal endpoints with access keys, depending on network and security requirements

## Core Components

### Image & Model Library
The foundational registry system that synchronizes LLM container images from external sources and maintains a centralized catalog of available language models. This component serves as the authoritative source for all LLM images within the organization, eliminating the chaos that typically results from teams maintaining separate, disconnected model repositories. Platform teams gain complete visibility into LLM inventory across the organization, while AI teams benefit from streamlined access to approved models without navigating complex approval processes for each deployment.

The Image & Model Library continuously monitors configured external registries and automatically ingests new LLM versions based on defined criteria, ensuring teams always have access to the latest approved language models without manual intervention. This automation reduces the operational burden on platform teams while ensuring consistent application of organizational policies across all ingested content.

**Key Functions:**
- Automated synchronization from configured container registries reduces manual overhead while ensuring consistency across LLM versions and sources
- Repository rule enforcement for selective LLM ingestion prevents unauthorized or non-compliant models from entering the organization's deployment pipeline
- Metadata management and version tracking provides complete lineage information that supports both operational troubleshooting and compliance reporting requirements
- Security scanning and vulnerability assessment automatically identifies potential risks before LLMs reach production environments

**Integration Points:**
