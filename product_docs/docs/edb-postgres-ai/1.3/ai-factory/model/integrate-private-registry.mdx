# Integrate Private Registry with Model Library

> Prerequisite: Access to the Hybrid Manager UI with AI Factory enabled. See /edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/ai-factory/.

This guide explains how to integrate your organization's **private container registry** with the AI Factory **Model Library**.

Once integrated, your custom-built or internally-approved model images will appear in the Model Library console, ready to deploy into Model Serving.

## Who should use this guide?

-   AI platform admins responsible for container registry governance.
-   DevOps engineers managing private registries for AI images.
-   Developers needing to deploy private AI models through AI Factory.

## What this enables

-   You can register private registries with Hybrid Manager (HCP).
-   HCP can discover AI model images in your registry.
-   These images will be available in the **Model Library** for deployment to Model Serving.
-   You can control visibility and usage of private model images across your AI Factory workloads.

## Estimated time to complete

10–15 minutes per registry configuration.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin:

-   You must have admin access to your private container registry (AWS ECR, GCP GCR, Azure ACR, Harbor, or similar).
-   You must have admin access to HCP (to configure registry integration).
-   You must know the required credentials (username/password or token) for your registry.
-   Your registry must expose a compatible Docker Registry API v2 endpoint.

## Supported registry types

-   AWS Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
-   Google Container Registry (GCR) / Artifact Registry
-   Azure Container Registry (ACR)
-   Harbor
-   Generic registries supporting Docker Registry API v2

## Integration Steps

### 1. Prepare registry credentials

-   For public registries → no authentication required.
-   For private registries → prepare one of:

    -   Username/password pair
    -   Personal access token
    -   Robot account credentials (Harbor)

Confirm you can perform a `docker pull` of your model images locally using these credentials.

### 2. Register your registry in HCP

-   In the console, go to:

`AI Factory > Model Library > Manage Repositories > Add Registry`

You will see a dialog prompting for:

| Field                 | Description                                                 |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Registry URL          | The full registry hostname (e.g., `myregistry.company.com`) |
| Registry Type         | Select from supported registry types                        |
| Username              | (Optional) Username for authentication                      |
| Password/Token        | (Optional) Password or token for authentication             |
| Registry Name (Label) | Friendly name displayed in Model Library console            |

-   Fill in the required fields.
-   Click **Add Registry**.

### 3. Verify registry integration

After adding:

-   HCP will attempt to connect to the registry and validate credentials.
-   If successful, your registry will appear in the **Manage Repositories** list.
-   HCP will begin periodic sync of repository tags from this registry.

### 4. Define Repository Rules

To control which repositories/tags are discovered:

-   After adding the registry, configure **Repository Rules**.
-   See: [Define Repository Rules for Model Library](define-repository-rules)

### 5. Validate image availability

After sync completes:

-   Go to **AI Factory > Model Library**.
-   Select the Registry scope or Repository filter.
-   Confirm your private model images appear with correct tags.

You can now deploy these images via the normal **Deploy to Model Serving** flow.

## Tips & Best Practices

-   Use **robot accounts** or **token-based auth** when possible to avoid exposing personal credentials.
-   Limit discovery scope via **Repository Rules** — avoid syncing the entire registry.
-   Tag images clearly with version info to aid selection in Model Library.
-   For multi-tenant environments, segment registry visibility carefully.

## Troubleshooting

### Registry connection failed

-   Check Registry URL (must not include `https://`, just the hostname).
-   Validate credentials by testing `docker login` manually.
-   Ensure Registry API v2 is enabled.

### Images not appearing

-   Check that Repository Rules allow the relevant repository.
-   Verify image has a valid tag.
-   Confirm periodic sync has completed.

### Authentication errors

-   For AWS ECR → ensure IAM permissions allow `ecr:GetAuthorizationToken`.
-   For Azure ACR → ensure token has `acrPull` role.
-   For GCR → use a service account with Artifact Registry access.

## Summary

-   You can integrate private registries with Model Library.
-   Your private model images become available to deploy via Model Serving.
-   You can govern visibility via Repository Rules.
-   Model Library unifies both public and private image sources for your AI workloads.
