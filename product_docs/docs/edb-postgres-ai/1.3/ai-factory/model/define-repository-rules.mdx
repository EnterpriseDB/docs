This guide explains how to define **Repository Rules** to control which model image repositories and tags from your connected registries appear in the AI Factory **Model Library**.

Repository Rules help you manage:

-   **Scope** of image discovery
-   **Governance** over which images are exposed
-   **Version control** by controlling which tags are visible

## Who should use this guide?

-   AI platform admins integrating private registries
-   DevOps engineers managing container registry integrations
-   Security/compliance teams governing AI model image usage

## What this enables

-   You can precisely control which image repositories HM syncs.
-   You can filter which tags within each repository are exposed.
-   You can govern which images are available in the Model Library for deployment.

## Estimated time to complete

5–10 minutes per Repository Rule.

## Prerequisites

-   You must have already [Integrated your Private Registry](integrate-private-registry).
-   Your registry must appear in **AI Factory > Model Library > Manage Repositories**.

## Understanding Repository Rules

Repository Rules are attached to each configured registry.

They allow you to define:

-   **Which repositories** to discover
-   **Which tags** within those repositories to expose

This prevents accidental exposure of test images, unvetted model builds, or entire registry contents.

Repository Rules are **evaluated periodically** — newly pushed images matching the rule will appear in Model Library on the next sync.

## How Repository Rules work

Each rule typically includes:

| Field           | Description                                                  |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Repository Name | Name of the repository to include (exact match or pattern)   |
| Tag Filter      | (Optional) Filter for tag names (exact match, prefix, regex) |
| Rule Enabled    | Whether this rule is currently active                        |

Example:

| Repository Name            | Tag Filter    |
| -------------------------- | ------------- |
| `my-company/llama3-models` | `^release-.*` |

→ Only tags starting with `release-` in `my-company/llama3-models` will appear.

## Defining Repository Rules

### 1. Navigate to Repository Rules

-   Go to:

`AI Factory > Model Library > Manage Repositories`

-   Click **Manage Rules** for your desired registry.

### 2. Add a Repository Rule

-   Click **Add Rule**.

-   Fill in:

    -   **Repository Name** — required
    -   **Tag Filter** — optional
    -   Enable/Disable toggle

-   Click **Save**.

The rule will appear in the rules list.

### 3. Wait for next sync or trigger manual sync

HM will apply rules on the next registry sync cycle.

If your UI supports manual sync:

-   Click **Sync Now** after adding/updating a rule.

### 4. Verify Model Library content

-   Go to **AI Factory > Model Library**.
-   Use filters to browse images from your registry.
-   Confirm only desired repositories/tags appear.

## Example Use Cases

### Basic: Restrict to a single repo

| Repository Name     | Tag Filter         |
| ------------------- | ------------------ |
| `my-org/nim-models` | (blank — all tags) |

→ All tags in `my-org/nim-models` will appear.

### Advanced: Filter to production tags

| Repository Name | Tag Filter |
| --------------- | ---------- |
| `models/gpt4`   | `^prod-.*` |

→ Only tags starting with `prod-` will appear.

### Multi-repo governance

-   Add multiple Repository Rules per registry as needed.
-   Use Tag Filters to align with your model promotion pipelines (dev, staging, prod).

## Tips & Best Practices

-   **Be explicit** — add Repository Rules for only the repositories you want to expose.
-   Use **Tag Filters** to enforce version governance and CI/CD promotion stages.
-   Regularly **audit Repository Rules** to ensure compliance with internal image standards.
-   If your registry uses structured tagging (e.g., `prod-`, `test-`), leverage Tag Filters to separate experimental from production models.

## Troubleshooting

### Images not appearing

-   Check that Repository Rule exists for the desired repo.
-   If using Tag Filter — verify tags match the filter exactly.
-   Check when the last sync ran; trigger manual sync if needed.

### Too many images appearing

-   Refine Repository Rules.
-   Add Tag Filters to narrow scope.

### Repository Rule has no effect

-   Confirm repository name is exact (case sensitive).
-   Ensure Rule is enabled.
-   Trigger manual sync and check HM logs if issue persists.

## Summary

-   Repository Rules govern which image repositories and tags appear in Model Library.
-   You can scope exposure by repository name and tag filters.
-   This supports governance, version control, and security best practices.
-   Fine-grained control helps ensure only vetted model images are deployed.
