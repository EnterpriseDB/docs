Examples of using preparers with the [SummarizeText operation](../primitives#summarize-text) in AI Accelerator.

## Model creation (required)

This step is required for primitive single execution and for preparer bulk execution.

```sql
-- Create the model. It must support the decode_text and decode_text_batch operations.
SELECT aidb.create_model('model__1952', 't5_local');
```

## Primitive

```sql
-- Keyword arguments
SELECT * FROM aidb.summarize_text(
    input => 'I don''t want a babysitter. I am eleven years old. My babysitter is only three years older than I am," she loudly yelled to her Mom. Now, she really wished she had somebody with her as she heard the clicking, scratching noises outside of the living room window. "This is silly. It''s probably the storm," the girl said. She regretted watching the horror show she had been tuned into for the last half hour. As she searched for the remote to turn off the vampire movie, the front door blew open with a thunderous noise. Carla whirled around to see a dark image.',
    options => '{"model": "model__1952"}'
);

__OUTPUT__
                                                                                                                     summarize_text

SELECT * FROM aidb.summarize_text(
    'There are times when the night sky glows with bands of color. The bands may begin as cloud shapes and then spread into a great arc across the entire sky. They may fall in folds like a curtain drawn across the heavens. The lights usually grow brighter, then suddenly dim. During this time the sky glows with pale yellow, pink, green, violet, blue, and red. These lights are called the Aurora Borealis. Some people call them the Northern Lights. Scientists have been watching them for hundreds of years. They are not quite sure what causes them. In ancient times Long Beach City College WRSC Page 2 of 2 people were afraid of the Lights. They imagined that they saw fiery dragons in the sky. Some even concluded that the heavens were on fire.',
    '{"model": "model__1952"}'
);

__OUTPUT__
                                                                                     summarize_text

## Preparer with table data source

```sql
-- Create source test table
CREATE TABLE source_table__1952
(
    id      INT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    content TEXT NOT NULL
);
INSERT INTO source_table__1952
VALUES (1, 'I don''t want a babysitter. I am eleven years old. My babysitter is only three years older than I am," she loudly yelled to her Mom. Now, she really wished she had somebody with her as she heard the clicking, scratching noises outside of the living room window. "This is silly. It''s probably the storm," the girl said. She regretted watching the horror show she had been tuned into for the last half hour. As she searched for the remote to turn off the vampire movie, the front door blew open with a thunderous noise. Carla whirled around to see a dark image.'),

## Model compatibility

The AI accelerator data preparation pipeline validates the options at creation time, including the model compatibility with the language adapter. These errors are returned in that case:

```sql
-- This model does not support the language adapter
SELECT aidb.create_model('bert_model', 'bert_local');
```

```sql
-- Single execution fails
SELECT * FROM aidb.summarize_text(
    input => 'Hello world',
    options => '{"model": "bert_model"}'
);
__OUTPUT__
ERROR:  The requested adapter is not supported by the model provider: bert_local
```

```sql
-- Preparer creation fails
SELECT aidb.create_table_preparer(
    name => 'preparer_name',
    operation => 'SummarizeText',
    source_table => 'source_table__1952',
    source_data_column => 'content',
    destination_table => 'summarized_data__1952',
    destination_data_column => 'summary',
    options => '{"model": "bert_model"}'::JSONB  -- Incompatible model
);
__OUTPUT__
ERROR:  Failed to create preparer: The requested adapter is not supported by the model provider: bert_local
```
