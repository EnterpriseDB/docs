navTitle: Data Engineer quickstart
description: Create a RAG pipeline with Pipelines and Vector Engine, configure auto-processing, and validate retrieval from Postgres.
---

## Prerequisites

- Access to Postgres with vector capabilities. See [Vector Engine](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/vector-engine).
- Storage locations or tables for source data. See [Pipelines](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline).
- Optional: Hybrid Manager if you plan to run managed workloads. See [AI Factory in Hybrid Manager](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/ai-factory).

## Steps

1) Prepare data and choose a Preparer
- Define how to chunk and clean inputs (tables or volumes).
- References: [Preparers](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/preparers).

2) Create a Knowledge Base
- Use table‑ or volume‑based Knowledge Bases to manage embeddings and vector indexes.
- References: [Knowledge Bases](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/knowledge_base).

3) Enable auto‑processing
- Keep embeddings current as data changes (sync/async, batch sizes).
- References: [Auto‑processing](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/capabilities/auto-processing/).

4) Validate retrieval from Postgres
- Use `aidb.retrieve_text` or `aidb.retrieve_key` via SQL/SDK to confirm recall.
- References: [Vector Engine](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/vector-engine).

5) Wire up Gen AI retrieval
- Create a Retriever for the Knowledge Base and test end‑to‑end with an Assistant.
- References: [Retrievers](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/reference/knowledge-bases/), [Agent Studio](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/ai-factory/gen-ai/agent-studio).

## Configuration values explained

- Chunking and overlap: Tune for your document structure; smaller chunks improve grounding but may increase storage.
- Embedding model: Choose a model suitable for your domain and language; keep consistent across ingestion and query.
- Auto‑processing cadence: Align with data update frequency to balance freshness and cost.

## Troubleshooting

- Low recall: Increase chunk overlap or top‑K; ensure the correct embedding model.
- Slow ingest: Adjust batch sizes; verify storage and network throughput.
- Index bloat: Periodically re‑embed or compact; verify deduplication in the pipeline.
