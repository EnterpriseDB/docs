## Overview: local file systems
PGFS uses the `file:` prefix to indicate a local file system.

The general syntax for using local file systems is this:
```sql
select pgfs.create_storage_location(
    'local_images',
    'file:///var/lib/edb/pipelines/images/'
       );
```

!!! Note
Paths must always be absolute; e.g., start at the root `/`. Together with the protocol prefix `file://`, this means your path will have three slashes as in the example above.
!!!

!!! Note
Any local path that you want to access must be allowlisted in the [PGFS settings](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/pgfs/settings).
!!!

!!! Note
Make sure to end your path with a `/` as in the examples above. This is required for path concatenation and validation with AIDB volumes.
