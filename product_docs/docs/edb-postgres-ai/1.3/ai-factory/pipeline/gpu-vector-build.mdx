## Overview

Building a vector index is a compute‑intensive process that can run for hours or days on very large tables. EDB Postgres AI – AI Accelerator (aidb) can use NVIDIA GPUs to accelerate vector index creation for the VectorChord `vchordq` index type.

Use GPU acceleration when creating indexes on large vector columns to significantly reduce build time.

## Requirements

Before using GPU acceleration, ensure the environment meets these requirements:

- Supported OS: Ubuntu 22.04/24.04, Debian 12, RHEL 9.
- CPU architecture: x86_64.
- Supported NVIDIA GPUs: architectures 8.9 and 9.0 (for example, L40, L4, H100, H200, GH200).
- NVIDIA GPU driver installed and functional.
- NVIDIA CUDA runtime 12.9 or newer installed.
- The VectorChord extension available on the system (for the `vchordq` index type). Please see <>

See also: general platform support in [Compatibility](./compatibility).

## Enable GPU acceleration

GPU acceleration is disabled by default. Enable it per session or at the server level.

- Per session:

```sql
SET aidb.gpu_acceleration = 'enable';
```

- Persist in the server configuration and reload:

```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET aidb.gpu_acceleration = 'enable';
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

To disable, set the value to `disable` and reload the configuration.

## Quick start example

The following example creates a table with a vector column, inserts sample data, and builds a GPU‑accelerated VectorChord index.

1) Create a test table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE test_10k_vecs (
  id        bigserial PRIMARY KEY,
  embedding vector(2000)
);
```

2) Insert sample vectors:

```sql
INSERT INTO test_10k_vecs (embedding)
SELECT arr.embedding
FROM generate_series(1, 10000) AS g(i)
CROSS JOIN LATERAL (
  SELECT array_agg(((g.i - 1) * 3 + gs.j)::real)
  FROM generate_series(1, 2000) AS gs(j)
) AS arr(embedding);
```

3) Build the GPU‑accelerated index:

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_vector_index_on_gpu(
  table_name      => 'public.test_10k_vecs',
  column_name     => 'embedding',
  cluster_count   => 1000
);
```

When the function completes, the table has a VectorChord `vchordq` index ready for use.

## Function reference

The `aidb.create_vector_index_on_gpu()` function runs the entire VectorChord index build on the GPU. It is analogous to `CREATE INDEX` for VectorChord.

Signature example with all parameters:

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_vector_index_on_gpu(
  table_name        => 'public.test_10k_vecs',
  column_name       => 'embedding',
  cluster_count     => 1000,
  sampling_factor   => 256,
  kmeans_iterations => 10,
  kmeans_nredo      => 1,
  distance_operator => 'ip',
  batch_size        => 1000000
);
```

Parameters:

- table_name: Fully qualified table name (`schema.table`).
- column_name: Name of the vector column to index.
- cluster_count: Number of clusters to use for the index (VectorChord “lists”).
- sampling_factor: Optional. Number of sample vectors for k‑means. Default: 256.
- kmeans_iterations: Optional. Number of k‑means iterations. Default: 10.
- kmeans_nredo: Optional. Number of k‑means restarts. Default: 1.
- distance_operator: Optional. Distance metric. One of `ip` (inner product), `l2` (Euclidean), or `cos` (cosine). Default: `ip`.
- batch_size: Optional. Controls processing batch size. Larger batches increase memory use but can improve throughput.

## Verification

After the function returns, verify that the index exists and is usable.

- List indexes on the table:

```sql
SELECT indexname, indexdef
FROM pg_indexes
WHERE schemaname = 'public' AND tablename = 'test_10k_vecs';
```

- Run an example query with your intended distance operator and use `EXPLAIN` to confirm index usage.

### Verify index usage with EXPLAIN

Replace `:query_vec` with a query vector literal or parameter of the same dimension as your column. Choose the operator that matches the `distance_operator` you used for index creation.

- L2 distance (`l2`):

```sql
EXPLAIN
SELECT id
FROM test_10k_vecs
ORDER BY embedding <-> :query_vec
LIMIT 10;
```

- Inner product (`ip`):

```sql
EXPLAIN
SELECT id
FROM test_10k_vecs
ORDER BY embedding <#> :query_vec
LIMIT 10;
```

- Cosine distance (`cos`):

```sql
EXPLAIN
SELECT id
FROM test_10k_vecs
ORDER BY embedding <=> :query_vec
LIMIT 10;
```

The plan should indicate an index‑assisted path (for example, Index Scan) rather than a full sequential scan. If needed for testing, temporarily set `SET enable_seqscan = off;` to encourage index usage while validating.

For details on vector distance operators `<->` (L2), `<#>` (inner product), and `<=>` (cosine), see the [Vector Engine](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/ai-factory/vector-engine/) documentation.

## Tuning and guidance

- Cluster count: Choose a value appropriate for your data size and query patterns, following VectorChord guidance for the number of lists.
- Batch size: Increase for faster builds when sufficient GPU memory is available; reduce if you encounter out‑of‑memory conditions.
- Distance operator: Match to how you plan to query the data (`ip`, `l2`, or `cos`).

## Troubleshooting

- GPU acceleration not enabled: Ensure `aidb.gpu_acceleration = 'enable'` and reload configuration if set via `ALTER SYSTEM`.
- No compatible GPU detected: Verify NVIDIA drivers and CUDA runtime installation.
- Missing VectorChord components: Ensure the VectorChord extension and its index type are installed on the node.
- Invalid arguments: Confirm the vector column exists, has a fixed dimension, and the table name is fully qualified.

## Notes and limitations

- GPU acceleration currently applies to VectorChord `vchordq` index builds.
- Supported hardware and OS are limited to the platforms listed in Requirements.
- The function runs synchronously and returns when the index build completes or fails.
