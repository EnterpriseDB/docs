From version 4.3.0 onwards, AI Accelerator supports in-place updates for the extension. Once the new version is installed you can run the `ALTER EXTENSION` command to update the extension in your Postgres database.

```sql
ALTER EXTENSION aidb UPDATE;
```

If you are upgrading from a version prior to 4.3.0, you need to follow the steps below to ensure a clean upgrade. This is because the extension was not designed for in-place updates before this version.

## Upgrading the Pipelines Extension (aidb)

!!!Note
This doesn't delete any managed data. It just ensures that no dangling references (e.g. Triggers) remain while AIDB is uninstalled, and allows you to do a clean setup after upgrading.
!!!

### 1. Delete all configured Pipelines

Get a list of all the knowledge base and preparer pipelines you have configured: `SELECT name FROM aidb.knowledge_bases;` and `SELECT name FROM aidb.preparers;`. Then delete all knowledge bases and preparer by calling `SELECT aidb.delete_knowledge_base('name');` and `SELECT aidb.delete_preparer('knowledge_base__5887');`.

You can use this SQL code to do both in one operation:

```sql
WITH names AS (SELECT name FROM aidb.knowledge_bases)
  SELECT aidb.delete_knowledge_base(name) FROM names;


WITH names AS (SELECT name FROM aidb.preparers)
  SELECT aidb.delete_preparer(name) FROM names;
```

### 2. Uninstall the old version of the extension

```sql
edb=# DROP EXTENSION aidb CASCADE;
DROP EXTENSION
edb=#
```

### 3. Install the new version of the extension in your environment

Follow the same steps you took to install the old version: [Manually installing pipelines packages](packages).

### 4. Create the extension in your Postgres Database

```sql
edb=# CREATE EXTENSION aidb CASCADE;
NOTICE:  installing required extension "vector"
CREATE EXTENSION
edb=#
```

### 5. Re-create the Pipelines you want to use

Run the same commands you originally ran to create the Pipelines.

## Upgrading PGFS

If you are using PGFS, you will need to drop and re-create the extension after upgrading.

!!!Note
This will delete references to your PGFS storage locations; it will not delete the actual data. Storage locations need to be re-created after upgrading.
!!!

```sql
DROP EXTENSION pgfs CASCADE;
CREATE EXTENSION pgfs CASCADE;
```
