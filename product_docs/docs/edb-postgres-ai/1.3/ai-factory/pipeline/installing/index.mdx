Pipelines is delivered as a set of extensions. Depending on how you're deploying Pipelines, these extensions can be installed by your deployment platform provider or already installed. Contact your deployment platform provider for details. If you deploy your own Postgres server, you need to install the extentions manually.

- [Manually installing pipelines packages](packages)

Once the packages are installed, you can [complete the installation](complete) by activating the extensions in Postgres.

If you have an existing installation and want to upgrade to a new version, see [upgrading Pipelines](upgrading).
