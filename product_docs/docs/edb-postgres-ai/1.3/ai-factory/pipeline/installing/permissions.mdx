A new database role, `aidb_users`, is created as part of the AIDB extension installation. Membership to this role is required for access to most extension functions. This role will not be removed if the extension is deleted.

`aidb_users` is designed to simplify access management for AIDB features:

- **Purpose:** Granting a user the `aidb_users` role provides access to all AIDB functions, allowing access to the extension's capabilities.
- **Security:** The `aidb_users` role does **not** grant access to AIDB's internal tables, ensuring that only the extension's public API is exposed to users.
- **Background Workers:** When background workers are used, they execute as the user who defined them, or as a role specified by the user—provided the user has access to that role.

To allow a user to use AIDB functions, simply grant them the `aidb_users` role:

```sql
GRANT aidb_users TO your_user;
```

Here is an example of creating a user named `alice` with no privileges or role membership to start with:

```sql
CREATE ROLE alice
  LOGIN
  PASSWORD 'change_me';   -- replace with a real password
```

Now add alice to the application group role `aidb_users`
```sql
GRANT aidb_users TO alice;
```

`alice` now inherits whatever global privileges `aidb_users` has
(for example: EXECUTE on routines in aidb, USAGE on schemas, etc.)

Give `alice` (not `aidb_users`) full rights on selected tables in public schema
This example shows three arbitrary tables. These would ordinarily be source tables
used in the pipeline
```sql
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
  ON public.documents,
     public.email_text,
     public.chats
  TO alice;
```

And in cases where you need `alice` to be able to create objects in `public`:

```sql
GRANT CREATE ON SCHEMA public TO alice;
```

Alice automatically owns whatever she creates, so she can ALTER or DROP her own objects.
She cannot drop or alter other users’ objects in `public`.

Now you may Verify privileges
```sql
\z public.documents,
\z public.email_text,
\z public.chats
