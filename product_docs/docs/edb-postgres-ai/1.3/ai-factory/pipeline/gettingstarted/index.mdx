## Where to start

The best place to start is with the [Pipelines overview](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/) to get an understanding of what Pipelines is and how it works.

## Installation

Pipelines is included with the EDB Postgres AI - AI Accelerator suite of tools. To install Pipelines, follow the instructions in the [AI Accelerator Installation Guide](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/installing/).

## Using Pipelines

After you have Pipelines installed, you can start using it to work with your data.

Log into your Postgres server and ensure the Pipelines extension is installed:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION aidb CASCADE;
```

This example works solely with Postgres table data, so you don't need to install the pgfs extension.

For the example, create a table to work with:

```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
   id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
   product_name TEXT NOT NULL,
   description TEXT,
   last_updated_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
__OUTPUT__
CREATE TABLE
```

Then insert some data into it:

```sql
INSERT INTO products (product_name, description) VALUES
      ('Hamburger', 'A delicious combination of bread and meat'),
      ('Cheesburger', 'Improving on a classic, the cheese brings favorite flavors'),
      ('Fish n Chips', 'The fish is a little greasy and the chips do not help'),
      ('Fries', 'Never sure about these on their own, needs seasoning'),
      ('Burrito', 'Always ready for this parcel of edible wonder'),
      ('Pizza', 'It is very much a staple, but the rolled dough with toppings does not inspire'),
      ('Sandwich', 'The blandest of offerings, the sandwich is predominantly boring bread'),
      ('Veggie Burger', 'The ultra-processed vegetable product in this is neither healthy nor delicious'),
      ('Kebab', 'Maybe one of the great edible treats, sliced lamb, salad and crisp pitta');
__OUTPUT__
INSERT 0 9
```

The result is a table with some data in it: food products and some very personal opinions about them.

!!!Note

This example uses simple, processed data. Pipelines can also handle multiple preprocessing steps via [preparers](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/preparers).

## Creating a knowledge base

The core of Pipelines is the *knowledge base*. A knowledge base is a way to access the data in the table and use it in AI workflows.

```sql
select aidb.create_table_knowledge_base('products_knowledge_base', 't5', 'products', 'description', 'Text');
__OUTPUT__
 create_table_knowledge_base
------------------------------
 products_knowledge_base
(1 row)
```

## Querying the knowledge base

After creating a knowledge base, you can query it to get similar results based on the data in the table.

```sql
select * from aidb.retrieve_key('products_knowledge_base','I like it',5);
__OUTPUT__
ERROR:  Query returned no data. Hint: The "products_knowledge_base_vector" table is likely empty. Make sure the embeddings have been computed.
```

This example hasn't computed embeddings for the knowledge_base yet.

The `products_knowledge_base_vector` table is where aidb keeps the computed embeddings for the knowledge_base.
Compute those embeddings now using `aidb.bulk_embedding`:

```sql
select aidb.bulk_embedding('products_knowledge_base');
__OUTPUT__
INFO:  products_knowledge_base: (re)setting state table to process all data...
INFO:  products_knowledge_base: Starting... Batch size 100, unprocessed rows: 9, count(source records): 9, count(embeddings): 0
INFO:  products_knowledge_base: Batch iteration finished, unprocessed rows: 0, count(source records): 9, count(embeddings): 9
INFO:  products_knowledge_base: Batch iteration finished, unprocessed rows: 0, count(source records): 9, count(embeddings): 9
INFO:  products_knowledge_base: finished, unprocessed rows: 0, count(source records): 9, count(embeddings): 9
 bulk_embedding
----------------

(1 row)
```

Now you can query the knowledge base again:

```sql
select * from aidb.retrieve_key('products_knowledge_base','I like it',4);
__OUTPUT__
 key |      distance
-----+--------------------
 4   | 1.0369428080621286
 3   |   1.03737124138149
 2   | 1.0839594107837638
 5   | 1.0869412071766262
(4 rows)
```

This query produces some results. The `key` column is the primary key of the row in the `products` table, and the `distance` column is the distance between the query and the result. The lower the distance, the more similar the result is to the query.

What you really want is the actual matching text, not just the key. You can use `aidb.retrieve_text` for that:

```sql
select * from aidb.retrieve_text('products_knowledge_base','I like it',4);
__OUTPUT__
 key |                           value                            |      distance
-----+------------------------------------------------------------+--------------------
 4   | Never sure about these on their own, needs seasoning       | 1.0369428080621286
 3   | The fish is a little greasy and the chips do not help      |   1.03737124138149
 2   | Improving on a classic, the cheese brings favorite flavors | 1.0839594107837638
 5   | Always ready for this parcel of edible wonder              | 1.0869412071766262
(4 rows)
```

Now you have the actual data from the table that matches the query.

You may want the row data from the `products` table instead of the `products_knowledge_base_vector` table. You can do that by joining the two tables:

```sql
 select * from aidb.retrieve_key('products_knowledge_base','I like it',4) as a
            left join products as b
            on a.key::integer=b.id;
__OUTPUT__
 key |      distance      | id | product_name |                        description                         |         last_updated_at
-----+--------------------+----+--------------+------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------
 2   | 1.0839594107837638 |  2 | Cheesburger  | Improving on a classic, the cheese brings favorite flavors | 04-DEC-24 16:48:52.599806 +00:00
 3   |   1.03737124138149 |  3 | Fish n Chips | The fish is a little greasy and the chips do not help      | 04-DEC-24 16:48:52.599806 +00:00
 4   | 1.0369428080621286 |  4 | Fries        | Never sure about these on their own, needs seasoning       | 04-DEC-24 16:48:52.599806 +00:00
 5   | 1.0869412071766262 |  5 | Burrito      | Always ready for this parcel of edible wonder              | 04-DEC-24 16:48:52.599806 +00:00
 (4 rows)
```

Now you have the actual data from the `products` table that matches the query. As you can see, the full power of Postgres is available to you to work with your AI workflows.

## One more thing: auto-processing

As it stands, vectors were calculated for the data, but if you add data to the table, it isn't automatically embedded. The knowledge base would go out of sync.

To keep the embeddings up to date, enable live [auto-processing](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/capabilities/auto-processing):

```sql
select aidb.set_auto_knowledge_base('products_knowledge_base', 'Live');
__OUTPUT__
 set_auto_knowledge_base
-------------------------------

(1 row)
```

Now, if you add data to the table, the embeddings are automatically calculated. You can quickly test this:

```sql
INSERT INTO products (product_name, description) VALUES
      ('Pasta', 'A carb-heavy delight that is always welcome, especially with a good sauce'),
      ('Salad', 'Meh, it is what it is and it is not much. Occasionally saved by a good dressing');
__OUTPUT__
NOTICE:  Running auto embedding for knowledge_base products. key: "10" content: "A carb-heavy delight that is always welcome, especially with a good sauce"
NOTICE:  Running auto embedding for knowledge_base products. key: "11" content: "Meh, it is what it is and it is not much. Occasionally saved by a good dressing"
INSERT 0 2
```

```sql
select * from aidb.retrieve_key('products_knowledge_base','I like it',4) as a
            left join products as b
            on a.key::interger=b.id;
__OUTPUT__
 key |      distance      | id | product_name |                                   description                                   |         last_updated_at
-----+--------------------+----+--------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------
 10  | 1.0351907976251493 | 10 | Pasta        | A carb-heavy delight that is always welcome, especially with a good sauce       | 04-DEC-24 17:09:44.97484 +00:00
 11  |  0.979874632270706 | 11 | Salad        | Meh, it is what it is and it is not much. Occasionally saved by a good dressing | 04-DEC-24 17:09:44.97484 +00:00
 3   |   1.03737124138149 |  3 | Fish n Chips | The fish is a little greasy and the chips do not help                           | 04-DEC-24 16:48:52.599806 +00:00
 4   | 1.0369428080621286 |  4 | Fries        | Never sure about these on their own, needs seasoning                            | 04-DEC-24 16:48:52.599806 +00:00
(4 rows)
```
