navTitle: Hub Map
description: A one-screen map of the AI Factory hub to help you find concepts, how-tos, and references fast — and understand how the Hybrid Manager spoke relates.

Use this page to jump directly to what you need. Each tile links to the right place in the hub or the Hybrid Manager spoke. For prerequisites and where components run, see the AI Factory landing page.

## Start here

- Concepts: Understand the architecture and components
  - [AI Factory Concepts](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/concepts)
  - [Terminology](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/concepts/terminology)
