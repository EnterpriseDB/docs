AI Factory is designed to help you build **Sovereign AI** solutions — where your **data**, **models**, and **AI-driven applications** operate under your governance, in your infrastructure, with your trusted content.

These use cases highlight how AI Factory components work together to support **real-world, production-ready Sovereign AI applications** — across industries and solution patterns.

For industry-specific solution examples, see: [Industry Solutions](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/learn/solutions).

## Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

**RAG** is a foundational pattern for Sovereign AI — it lets you deliver **accurate, grounded responses** by combining **LLMs** with your enterprise data.

### What

-   Use AI models that **retrieve trusted content** from your Knowledge Bases, rather than relying only on opaque base models.
-   Make responses **auditable** and **explainable** — key for Sovereign AI.

### Why

-   Reduce hallucinations.
-   Maintain compliance and traceability.
-   Ensure AI answers reflect your latest business knowledge.

### How

-   Build [Knowledge Bases](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/create-knowledge-base) from your Data Sources.
-   Implement tuned [Retrievers](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/structures/create-retriever) for semantic search.
-   Power [Assistants](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/assistants/create-assistant) and apps with RAG pipelines.

## Document Intelligence Pipelines

Automate the transformation of documents into **structured, queryable knowledge** that remains **inside your governance boundary**.

### What

-   Apply **OCR**, **parsing**, **summarization**, and **metadata extraction**.
-   Store results in [Knowledge Bases](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/create-knowledge-base) or **Vector Engine**.

### Why

-   Keep sensitive documents in your infrastructure — no third-party API calls required.
-   Build explainable pipelines for compliance-heavy domains.

### How

-   Use [Pipelines](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/gettingstarted).
-   Leverage built-in [Preparers](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/preparers) (OCR, parse PDF, parse HTML).
-   Index results for search or RAG.

## Conversational Assistants and Chatbots

Build Assistants that run **within your infrastructure**, use **your models**, and rely on **your Knowledge Bases** — with complete visibility and control.

### What

-   AI Assistants powered by **Model Serving** and your **RAG pipeline**.
-   Defined and governed with [Rulesets](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/rulesets/create-ruleset).

### Why

-   Avoid relying on public API services for LLM responses.
-   Control tone, style, compliance — essential for Sovereign AI.

### How

-   Build [Assistants](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/assistants/create-assistant) in Agent Studio.
-   Govern behavior with [Rulesets](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/rulesets/create-ruleset).
-   Add [Tools](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/tools/create-tool) to safely integrate internal systems.

### Learn More

-   Agent Studio in Hybrid Manager

## Semantic Search Across Enterprise Content

Enable **natural language search** on your content — while ensuring embeddings and search data remain **inside your control**.

### What

-   Vector-based search on **Knowledge Bases** or **Vector Engine**.
-   Supports text, hybrid structured/unstructured data, images.

### Why

-   Keep embeddings in your databases or object storage — not in third-party vector DBs.
-   Maintain auditability and security.

### How

-   Build [Knowledge Bases](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/create-knowledge-base).
-   Use [Retrievers](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/structures/create-retriever) to expose search to Assistants or apps.
-   Use [Vector Engine](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/vector-engine) for in-database search.

## Real-Time Model Inference APIs

Deploy and serve models **inside your Kubernetes clusters**, under your governance — not through opaque third-party APIs.

### What

-   Serve LLMs, embeddings, vision models via **KServe-based Model Serving**.
-   Models pulled from your [Model Library](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/library/), deployed via [InferenceService](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/create-inferenceservice).

### Why

-   Full control of model stack and model versions.
-   Run inference in **GPU-accelerated, air-gapped environments** if needed.

### How

-   Manage models in [Model Library](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/library/).
-   Deploy with [Model Serving](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/serving/).
-   Secure endpoints with Hybrid Manager controls.

-   AI categorization
-   Document summarization
-   Metadata extraction
-   Data cleansing

### Why

-   Avoid sending sensitive data to cloud APIs.
-   Build reusable, explainable ETL components.
