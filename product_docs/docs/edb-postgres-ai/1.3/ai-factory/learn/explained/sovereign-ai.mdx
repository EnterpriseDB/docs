# Sovereign AI Explained

**Sovereign AI** is a core principle of **EDB Postgres® AI** (EDB PG AI):
Giving you full control over your **data**, **models**, and **AI stack** — with **auditability**, **security**, and **trust** built in.

Rather than relying on opaque cloud APIs and external data flows, **Sovereign AI** ensures that your intellectual property, business data, and AI-driven applications stay under your governance — and run on infrastructure you control.

---

## Why it matters

AI is transforming how organizations interact with data and deliver new experiences.
But with AI adoption comes real risks:

- Many public AI APIs are **black boxes** — you lose control over how your data is used.
- AI embeddings and vectors often become **orphaned** in third-party systems.
- Sensitive data may leave compliance boundaries — creating **regulatory risk**.
- AI results may be **non-auditable**, raising concerns in regulated industries.
- Application **traceability** and **explainability** are often missing.

**Sovereign AI** answers these challenges:

* **Own your data and embeddings** — stored in Postgres and your object storage.
* **Own your models and AI stack** — served through Pipelines and Model Serving.
* **Own your Knowledge Bases** — fully governable, versioned, and auditable.
* **Own your AI workloads** — running in Kubernetes environments you control.
* **Own your Assistant behavior** — defined, governed, and observable in Agent Studio.

## What is Sovereign AI?

**Sovereign AI** is an architecture and operating model where:

- **Data stays inside your trust boundaries**.
- **AI pipelines are fully transparent and auditable**.
- **Model serving happens on infrastructure you manage**.
- **Embeddings are stored where you control them** (Postgres, object storage).
- **Assistant behavior is governed and versioned**.
- **APIs exposed to your users are secured and observable**.
- You can **choose whether and how external APIs are involved** — no hidden dependencies.

**Sovereign AI is a spectrum** — not an all-or-nothing choice:

- Some organizations will want **fully self-managed, zero external API** architectures.
- Others will use hybrid models — **private Knowledge Bases + public LLMs**, carefully governed.
- EDB PG AI supports this full spectrum — and ensures you are never locked into an external stack.

## How EDB PG AI enables Sovereign AI

EDB PG AI is designed from the ground up for Sovereign AI:

* **Data-first architecture** — Knowledge starts in your databases and object storage.
* **Vector Engine** — Your embeddings live in Postgres or controlled storage.
* **Pipelines** — You control every step of the data-to-embedding-to-query pipeline.
* **Model Serving** — Models run on your Kubernetes infrastructure, under your governance.
* **Agent Studio** — Rulesets, Tools, Structures, and Assistants are all governed assets.
* **Observability** — Full audit trails and monitoring of model and Assistant activity.

### Key components:

- [Vector Engine](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/vector-engine) — Vector search in your Postgres clusters.
- [Pipelines](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/pipeline) — Controlled creation of Knowledge Bases and embeddings.
- [Model Serving](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/model/serving) — Kubernetes-native, GPU-accelerated model inference.
- [Agent Studio](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/gen-ai/agent-studio) — Governed Assistant and Tool development.

You can also selectively integrate **external LLM APIs** — but **with full visibility and choice**.

## Why Hybrid Manager?

Today, EDB PG AI’s **strongest Sovereign AI model** is delivered with **Hybrid Manager™** (EDB):

[See: Hybrid Manager Gen AI Workloads](../../gen-ai/)

Hybrid Manager provides the architecture to:

- Deploy Pipelines and Model Serving on **EDB-optimized Kubernetes**.
- Manage Knowledge Bases with **full lifecycle control**.
- Monitor and trace all AI activity — at the database, Pipeline, and Assistant levels.
- Govern **model deployment**, image provenance, and retriever configurations.
- Enable **secure API access** to Assistants and semantic search.
- Implement fine-grained **data residency and trust boundaries**.

**Full stack control** — from your Postgres database → embeddings → Pipelines → model inference → Assistants and APIs — all observable and auditable.

---

## Summary

* **Sovereign AI** is about trust, transparency, and control.
* EDB PG AI gives you a complete stack to implement Sovereign AI — with no lock-in.
* You choose how **open or closed** your AI architecture is — but you never lose **control of your data**.
* Hybrid Manager provides a production-proven platform for deploying **trusted, governed AI** in the enterprise.
