## What is a Tool

A **Tool** in Gen AI Builder is a Griptape-powered component that extends the capabilities of AI Assistants and Structures by enabling them to perform actions beyond simple text generation.

Tools act as callable functions or plugins that can:

- Query external systems.
- Perform calculations.
- Retrieve live data.
- Interact with APIs.
- Execute business logic.

In short:
**Tools make your AI *active*, not just reactive — enabling it to take meaningful actions.**

Without Tools, Assistants and Structures are limited to generating responses based on static knowledge.

## Why use Tools

- To enable AI-driven applications that can **interact with external systems**.
- To enrich conversations with **live data**.
- To automate **business processes**.
- To implement **organization-specific logic** as reusable components.
- To allow LLMs to answer questions they otherwise could not — by giving them access to Tools.

Tools transform Assistants from static Q&A bots into **true interactive agents**.

## How Tools work

Tools are implemented as **Griptape Tools** — Python classes that define one or more callable activities.

At runtime:

1. User submits input to an Assistant.
2. The LLM determines that a Tool should be used.
3. The Assistant calls the Tool, passing required parameters.
4. The Tool executes:
- Calls an API.
- Performs a calculation.
- Fetches data.
- Runs any defined business logic.
5. The Tool returns results to the Assistant.
6. The Assistant incorporates the Tool result into its response.

The flow:
```
User Input → Assistant → LLM decides → Tool Invocation
→ Tool executes → Tool result → LLM generates final response → User Output
```


Tool configuration:

- Packaged as a Zip file or deployed from GitHub.
- Includes:
- Griptape Tool class (Python).
- Tool Config file.
- Environment variables (e.g., API keys).

Tools can also be used:

- Within **Structures** → as components of pipelines.
- In **Data Source pipelines** → for data transformation.

## When to use Tools

Use Tools when you need:

- **Live data retrieval**:
- Stock prices
- Weather
- Exchange rates
- News headlines
- **API integration**:
- Internal databases
- CRM systems
- Custom applications
- **Business logic execution**:
- Complex calculations
- Rule-based processing
- **Process automation**:
- Multi-step workflows triggered by user input

If you want an Assistant to answer:

*"What’s the current EUR to USD exchange rate?"*
→ You need a Tool.

If you want an Assistant to:

*"Summarize all open Jira tickets for my team."*
→ You need a Tool.

## Patterns of use

### API Connector Tool

- Calls an external API and returns data.
- Example: `FX Rate Tool`, `Weather Lookup Tool`.

### Calculator Tool

- Performs internal calculations and returns result.
- Example: `Mortgage Calculator Tool`.

### Data Fetcher Tool

- Retrieves data from an internal system.
- Example: `Customer Profile Lookup Tool`.

### Data Transformer Tool

- Preprocesses or transforms data.
- Example: `Document Summarizer Tool`.

### Process Automation Tool

- Triggers multi-step processes or workflows.
- Example: `Order Processing Tool`.

## Best practices

- Implement Tools as **modular Griptape Tools**:
- Use @activity decorators for activities.
- Define clear input/output schemas.
- Write **robust error handling** — handle API failures gracefully.
- Externalize secrets via **environment variables** — never hardcode credentials.
- Keep Tools focused — one Tool → one purpose.
- Use **Tool metadata and versioning** to manage lifecycle.
- Test Tools independently before integrating with Assistants.
- Monitor Tool usage and performance.
- Document Tool behavior clearly for users and developers.
