**Rulesets** in **Gen AI Builder** provide behavioral and policy guidance to AI Assistants and Griptape Structures.
They define *how* your AI should behave — shaping tone, style, compliance, and persona.

Rulesets complement **Knowledge Bases** and **Retrievers**:

-   Knowledge Bases provide *what* the AI knows.
-   Rulesets define *how* the AI responds.

Rulesets are essential for building **governed, brand-aligned, and compliant AI experiences** in enterprise environments.

* * *

## Before you start

Prerequisites for understanding Rulesets:

-   Basic understanding of **Assistants** and how they generate responses
-   Familiarity with **Knowledge Bases** and **Retrievers** in AI Factory
-   Awareness of **Griptape Structures** and how they control RAG pipelines

## What is a Ruleset?

A **Ruleset** is a collection of natural language instructions that guide the behavior of an Assistant or Structure.

Rulesets:

-   Control **tone and style**
-   Enforce **legal, ethical, or organizational policies**
-   Define **Assistant personas**
-   Provide consistent behavior across applications
-   Support **auditable AI governance**

**Without Rulesets:** Assistants rely solely on base model behavior — which may not align with your enterprise standards.

* * *

## How Rulesets work

At runtime:

```
User Input → Retriever → Knowledge Base → Retrieved Content
→ Ruleset → Behavioral Instructions → LLM Prompt → AI Response
```

-   The **Retriever** gathers content from Knowledge Bases.
-   The **Ruleset** is injected into the Assistant’s system prompt.
-   The LLM uses:
-   The **Ruleset** to guide tone, style, and behavior.
-   The **retrieved content** to ground the response.
-   The **user query** as primary input.
-   The final response reflects both **content grounding** and **Ruleset-driven behavior**.

Rulesets are implemented as **Griptape Structures** and fully support modular, reusable patterns.

* * *

## Why use Rulesets

-   **Governed behavior** — enforce compliance and legal requirements.
-   **Brand alignment** — ensure Assistants reflect your organizational voice.
-   **Persona support** — build distinct personas for different use cases.
-   **Explainability** — provide clear behavioral logic for audit and review.
-   **Sovereign AI** — define controlled behavior fully within your governed infrastructure.

Rulesets are critical for **production-grade Assistants** — especially in regulated industries.

* * *

## Components of a Ruleset

A Ruleset includes:

-   **Natural language Rules** — clear instructions to the LLM (e.g., tone, forbidden phrases, required disclaimers).
-   **Metadata** — versioning, tracking, and audit support.
-   **Aliases** — to enable shared Rulesets across multiple Assistants.

Rules are expressed in natural language and injected at **prompt time** via Griptape.

* * *

## Patterns of use

### Single Ruleset → One Assistant

-   Simple pattern.
-   One Ruleset assigned to one Assistant.
-   Example: `Customer Support Tone` → `Support Assistant`.

### Shared Ruleset → Multiple Assistants

-   A global Ruleset reused across many Assistants.
-   Example: `Financial Advice Disclaimer` → used by:
-   `Wealth Management Copilot`
-   `Internal Policy Checker`
-   `Client-Facing Advisor Assistant`

### Layered Persona Rulesets

-   Compose an Assistant’s behavior from multiple Rulesets:
-   **Brand Tone**
-   **Legal Compliance**
-   **Assistant Persona**
-   Example:
-   `Global Compliance` + `Banking Brand Tone` + `Wealth Advisor Persona`

### Dynamic Persona Switching

-   Advanced use case:
-   Assistants switch persona Rulesets at runtime based on user context.
-   Example:
-   One Assistant dynamically applies:
-   `Retail Client Tone` for B2C users.
-   `Institutional Investor Tone` for B2B users.

* * *

## Best practices

-   Write **clear, unambiguous Rules** in plain natural language.
-   Test Rulesets **in context** — ensure they interact well with retrieved content.
-   Avoid overlapping or contradictory Rules.
-   Modularize Rulesets for **reuse**:
-   Global Compliance
-   Tone of Voice
-   Persona-specific behavior
-   Use **versioned Rulesets** and maintain an **audit trail** in regulated environments.
-   Review and refresh Rulesets regularly to align with evolving policies and brand guidance.

* * *

## Sovereign AI alignment

Rulesets play a key role in **Sovereign AI** within EDB PG AI:

-   You control all Ruleset content — no external models define behavior.
-   Rulesets are fully **auditable** and can be versioned and reviewed.
-   Behavior governance is enforced **inside your infrastructure** — aligned with Knowledge Bases and Model Serving.
-   Combined with observability, Rulesets enable:
-   Transparent governance of AI behavior.
-   Alignment with legal and compliance frameworks.
-   Explainability for end users and auditors.

* * *

## Summary

Rulesets are a foundational element of production AI pipelines:

-   Control behavior, tone, and compliance
-   Enable consistent brand voice
-   Support complex personas and layered behavior
-   Fully auditable and versionable
-   Critical for **Sovereign AI** governance in enterprise environments

Without Rulesets, Assistants lack necessary guardrails and cannot meet enterprise-grade governance requirements.
