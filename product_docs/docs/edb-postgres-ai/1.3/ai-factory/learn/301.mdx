# Modules by Focus Area

* * *

## 1. Agentic Assistants and Advanced Tools

**Goals:**

-   Build Assistants that reason and act with multi-step Tool usage
-   Implement advanced Tools for external API integration
-   Chain Tools and manage context flow

**Estimated Time:** ~45–60 min

**Modules:**

1.  [Assistants Explained](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/assistants/assistants-explained/) — Architect assistants that reason, retrieve, and act across tools.
2.  [Tools Explained](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/tools/tools-explained/) — Design governed actions that call internal or external systems.
3.  [Create a Tool](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/tools/create-tool/) — Implement robust, reusable tool integrations for agent workflows.
4.  [Structures Explained](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/structures/structures-explained/) — Build multi-step pipelines and agent behaviors.

* * *

## 2. Extending Model Serving

**Goals:**

-   Create custom **ServingRuntime** definitions for specialized models
-   Add **Transformers** and **Explainers** to Model Serving pipelines
-   Understand advanced deployment patterns for KServe-based serving

**Estimated Time:** ~45–60 min

**Modules:**

1.  [Model Serving Concepts](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/model-serving-concepts/)
2.  [Configure ServingRuntime](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/configure-servingruntime/) — Create custom runtimes for specialized models and settings.
3.  [Advanced ServingRuntime Configuration](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/how-to) *(placeholder — expand with custom Transformers/Explainers patterns)*

* * *

## 3. Observability and Governance at Scale

**Goals:**

-   Implement enterprise-grade **observability** for AI pipelines and Model Serving
-   Monitor **Tool usage** and pipeline performance
-   Build custom dashboards for hybrid AI workloads

**Estimated Time:** ~30–45 min

**Modules:**

1.  [Observability for Model Serving](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/observability/) — Metrics, logs, and traces for serving and pipelines.
2.  [Monitor InferenceService](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/monitor-inferenceservice/) — Health and performance of serving endpoints.
3.  [Hybrid Manager Observability](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/ai-factory/model/serving/)

* * *

## 4. Automation and API Integration

**Goals:**

-   Use **Hybrid Manager and AI Factory APIs** to automate workflows
-   Integrate AI Factory pipelines into CI/CD and AI systems
-   Manage large-scale AI Factory deployments via API-driven control

**Estimated Time:** ~20–30 min

**Modules:**

1.  [Hybrid Manager API Overview](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/using_the_api/)
2.  [Using the Hybrid Manager API](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/using_the_api/using_the_hm_api/)
