Welcome to the **AI Factory Learning Center** — your central starting point for building with **EDB Postgres® AI** (EDB PG AI).

**EDB PG AI** enables **Sovereign AI** — using your data, in your databases and data center, to power intelligent applications and data products. The platform builds directly on Postgres with integrated vector search, Pipelines, Gen AI Builder, Knowledge Bases, and Model Serving.

Use this Learning Center to:

-   Understand key concepts and architecture
-   Follow step-by-step how-to guides
-   Progress through structured learning paths
-   Complete practical tutorials
-   Explore solution patterns and real-world use cases

## Quickstarts

Get productive fast with role-based guides:
