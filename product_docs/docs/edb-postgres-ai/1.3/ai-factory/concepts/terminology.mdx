## Core AI concepts

### Machine learning (ML)

Machine learning uses algorithms that improve through data exposure to perform tasks without explicit programming. It powers predictive analytics, automation, and decision making in AI Factory through [Model Serving](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/serving/), Pipelines, and Assistants.

### Deep learning (DL)

Deep learning leverages multi-layer neural networks to model complex data patterns. It supports advanced applications such as language understanding and image recognition within AI Factory, enabled through [Model Serving](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/serving/) with GPU acceleration.

### Natural language processing (NLP)

Natural language processing (NLP) enables computers to understand and generate human language. It underpins semantic search and conversational AI in AI Factory via [Knowledge Bases](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/libraries/knowledge-bases-explained/), [Retrievers](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/structures/retrievers-explained/), and [Assistants](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/assistants/assistants-explained/).

[Learn more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing)

### Large language models (LLMs)

LLMs are large deep learning models trained on massive text corpora. In AI Factory, they drive [Assistants](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/assistants/assistants-explained/), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and various model pipelines, deployed using [Model Serving](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/serving/).

### Embeddings

Embeddings are vector representations of data that capture semantic meaning. AI Factory Pipelines create embeddings used in [Knowledge Bases](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/libraries/knowledge-bases-explained/) and served through the [Vector Engine](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/vector-engine/) to enable semantic search and RAG.

[Learn more](https://sebastianraschka.com/blog/2023/llm-embeddings.html)

### Vector databases

Vector databases store embeddings and enable fast similarity search. AI Factory provides this through the [Vector Engine](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/vector-engine/), built on the open-source [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) extension, integrated directly with Postgres.

### Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)

RAG combines vector search with LLM generation to ground model responses in relevant documents. In AI Factory, it is implemented through [Knowledge Bases](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/libraries/knowledge-bases-explained/), [Retrievers](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/structures/retrievers-explained/), and [Model Serving](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/serving/).

## AI for databases

### Intelligent database management

Intelligent database management applies AI to optimize Postgres performance and operations. AI Factory extends this with intelligent retrieval and search using [Vector Engine](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/vector-engine/) and Pipelines.

### In-database machine learning (In-DB ML)

In-DB ML enables running vector search and ML pipelines inside Postgres, reducing data movement and latency. AI Factory implements this through [Vector Engine](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/vector-engine/) and [Pipelines](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/).

### Vector search in Postgres

Vector search allows you to query embeddings directly within Postgres. AI Factory uses [pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) to power this capability through the [Vector Engine](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/vector-engine/), supporting Knowledge Bases and RAG.

### AIDB

AIDB (AI-in-Database) brings vector search, embedding pipelines, and future ML capabilities to HCP-managed Postgres clusters. It is the foundation for AI Factory [Pipelines](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/) and Knowledge Bases.

### Natural language interfaces to databases

Natural language interfaces enable users to query Postgres using natural language rather than SQL. AI Factory Assistants leverage this pattern through [Gen AI Builder](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/hybrid-manager/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder/), combining LLMs with structured and unstructured retrieval.

## AI infrastructure

### AI-accelerated hardware


AI Factory uses GPU-accelerated Kubernetes clusters to serve deep learning models and high-throughput inference. Model workloads in [Model Serving](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/ai-factory/model/serving/) run on GPU-enabled nodes.

### KServe

KServe is the open-source Kubernetes-native framework AI Factory uses to deploy and manage ML models. It provides InferenceServices, autoscaling, and observability for AI Factory [Model Serving](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/serving/).
