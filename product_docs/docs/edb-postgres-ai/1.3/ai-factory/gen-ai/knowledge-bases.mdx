## Practical Scenarios

- Policy and procedures KB (enterprise internal): centralize HR/IT/Legal docs with strong citations.
  - Build steps: connect sources via [Data Sources](data-sources) → [Create Knowledge Base](create-knowledge-base) → validate retrieval with golden questions → attach via [Create Retriever](create-retriever).

- Product documentation KB (support): ground agent answers on manuals and FAQs.
  - Build steps: ingest docs (S3/Drive/Confluence) → [Create Knowledge Base](create-knowledge-base) → tune chunking/metadata → link to a support [Assistant](create-assistant).

- Hybrid catalog KB (structured + unstructured): combine product attributes (structured) with descriptions/reviews (unstructured).
  - Build steps: prepare structured columns and unstructured text → create a Hybrid KB in [Create Knowledge Base](create-knowledge-base) → expose filters in your [Retriever](create-retriever).

- Analytics RAG KB: enable semantic exploration of reports and wiki knowledge.
  - Build steps: prepare embeddings via [Pipelines](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/) or Data Lake + loaders → [Create Knowledge Base](create-knowledge-base) → test relevance and latency; integrate with an [Assistant](create-assistant).
