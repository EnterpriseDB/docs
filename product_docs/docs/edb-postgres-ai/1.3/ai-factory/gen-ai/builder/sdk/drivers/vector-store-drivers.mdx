## Overview

Gen AI Builder provides a way to build drivers for vector DBs where embeddings can be stored and queried. Every Vector Store Driver implements the following methods:

-   `upsert()` for updating or inserting new text, [TextArtifact](../reference/artifacts/text_artifact.mdx)s or [ImageArtifact](../reference/artifacts/text_artifact.mdx)s into vector DBs. The method will automatically generate embeddings for a given value.
-   `upsert_collection()` for performing an `upsert()` in parallel.
-   `upsert_vector()` for updating new vectors directly.
-   `query()` for querying vector DBs.

Each Vector Store Driver takes a [BaseEmbeddingDriver](../reference/drivers/embedding/base_embedding_driver.mdx) used to dynamically generate embeddings for strings.

!!! info

    When working with vector database indexes with Gen AI Builder Drivers, make sure the number of dimensions is equal to 1536. Nearly all embedding models create vectors with this number of dimensions. Check the documentation for your vector database on how to create/update vector indexes.

!!! info

    More Vector Store Drivers are coming soon.

## Vector Store Drivers

### Local

The [LocalVectorStoreDriver](../reference/drivers/vector/local_vector_store_driver.mdx) can be used to load and query data from memory. Here is a complete example of how the Driver can be used to load a webpage into the Driver and query it later:

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

```python
import os

from griptape.chunkers import TextChunker
from griptape.drivers.embedding.openai import OpenAiEmbeddingDriver
from griptape.drivers.vector.local import LocalVectorStoreDriver
from griptape.loaders import WebLoader

# Initialize an Embedding Driver
embedding_driver = OpenAiEmbeddingDriver(api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"])

vector_store_driver = LocalVectorStoreDriver(embedding_driver=embedding_driver)

# Load Artifacts from the web
artifact = WebLoader().load("https://www.griptape.ai")
chunks = TextChunker(max_tokens=100).chunk(artifact)

# Upsert Artifacts into the Vector Store Driver
vector_store_driver.upsert_collection({"griptape": chunks})

results = vector_store_driver.query(query="What is griptape?")

values = [r.to_artifact().value for r in results]

print("\n\n".join(values))

```

The format for creating a vector index should look similar to the following:

```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "numDimensions": 1536,
      "path": "<path_to_vector>",
      "similarity": "euclidean",
      "type": "vector"
    },
    {
      "path": "namespace",
      "type": "filter"
    }
  ]
}
```

Replace `path_to_vector` with the expected field name where the vector content will be.

### Redis

!!! info

    This Driver requires the `drivers-vector-redis` [extra](..#installing-optional-dependencies).

The [RedisVectorStoreDriver](../reference/drivers/vector/redis_vector_store_driver.mdx) integrates with the Redis vector storage system.

Here is an example of how the Driver can be used to load and query information in a Redis Cluster:

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

```python
import os

from griptape.chunkers import TextChunker
from griptape.drivers.embedding.openai import OpenAiEmbeddingDriver
from griptape.drivers.vector.redis import RedisVectorStoreDriver
from griptape.loaders import WebLoader

# Initialize an Embedding Driver
embedding_driver = OpenAiEmbeddingDriver(api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"])

vector_store_driver = RedisVectorStoreDriver(
    host=os.environ["REDIS_HOST"],
    port=int(os.environ["REDIS_PORT"]),
    username=os.environ["REDIS_USERNAME"],
    password=os.environ["REDIS_PASSWORD"],
    index=os.environ["REDIS_INDEX"],
    embedding_driver=embedding_driver,
)

# Load Artifacts from the web
artifact = WebLoader().load("https://www.griptape.ai")
chunks = TextChunker(max_tokens=200).chunk(artifact)

# Upsert Artifacts into the Vector Store Driver
vector_store_driver.upsert_collection(
    {
        "griptape": chunks,
    }
)

results = vector_store_driver.query(query="What is griptape?")

values = [r.to_artifact().value for r in results]

print("\n\n".join(values))

```

- Measure performance, reliability, and spending across the organization
- Enforce policy for each user, structure, task, and query
üé¢ Griptape Framework
Griptape provides clean and clear abstractions for building Gen AI Agents, Systems of Agents, Pipelines, Workflows, and RAG implementations without having to spend weeks learning Gen AI nor need to ever learn Prompt Engineering.
Build
Build ETL pipelines to prep your data for secure LLM access.
Compose
Compose retrieval patterns that give fast, accurate, detailed information.
Write
Write agents, pipelines, and workflows (i.e. structures) to integrate your business logic.
üå©Ô∏è Griptape Cloud
Skip the infrastructure management. We‚Äôll host and operate everything for you, from the data processing pipeline to the retrieval-ready database to the serverless application runtime. Simple to complex, one layer of the stack or the whole enchilada, we‚Äôve got you covered.
Automated Data Prep
(ETL)
Connect any data source and extract. Prep/transform it (extract, clean, chunk, embed, add metadata). Load it into a vector database index.
Retrieval as a Service
(RAG)
Generate answers, summaries, and details from your own data. Use ready-made retrieval patterns, customize them to fit your use case, or compose your own from scratch (Modular RAG).
Structure Runtime
(RUN)
Build your own AI agents, pipelines, and workflows. Real-time interfaces, transactional processes, batch workloads. Plug them into client applications.

### PG.AI

!!! info

    This Driver requires the `drivers-vector-pgai` [extra](..#installing-optional-dependencies).

The PgAiKnowledgeBaseVectorStoreDriver integrates with PG.AI, a managed postgres platform from [EnterpriseDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/).

Here is an example of how the Driver can be used to load and query information in a PG.AI Knowledge Base:

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

```python
import os

from griptape.drivers.vector.pgai import PgAiKnowledgeBaseVectorStoreDriver

# PG.AI connection parameters
connection_string = os.environ["PGAI_CONNECTION_STRING"]
knowledge_base_name = os.environ["PGAI_KNOWLEDGE_BASE_NAME"]

vector_store_driver = PgAiKnowledgeBaseVectorStoreDriver(
    connection_string=connection_string,
    knowledge_base_name=knowledge_base_name,  # optional
)

results = vector_store_driver.query(query="What is griptape?")

values = [r.to_artifact().value for r in results]

print("\n\n".join(values))

```
