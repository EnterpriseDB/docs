## Overview

A [Ruleset](../reference/rules/ruleset.mdx) can be used to define [Rule](../reference/rules/base_rule.mdx)s for [Structures](./) and [Tasks](tasks.mdx). Gen AI Builder places Rules into the LLM's system prompt for strong control over the output.

## Types of Rules

### Rule

[Rule](../reference/rules/base_rule.mdx)s shape the LLM's behavior by defining specific guidelines or instructions for how it should interpret and respond to inputs. Rules can be used to modify language style, tone, or even behavior based on what you define.

!!! tip

    Avoid writing large amounts of text in a single Rule.
    Breaking down your Rules generally helps the LLM follow them more effectively. Additionally, it makes it easier to evaluate the Rule's effectiveness using tools like the [Eval Engine](../engines/eval-engines.mdx).
    If you have an existing system prompt, consider [overriding the default system prompt](rulesets.mdx#overriding-system-prompts) instead.

```python
from griptape.rules import Rule, Ruleset
from griptape.structures import Agent

pipeline = Agent(
    rulesets=[
        Ruleset(
            name="Personality",
            rules=[Rule("Talk like a pirate.")],
        ),
    ]
)

pipeline.run("Hi there! How are you?")

```

```

### Json Schema

!!! tip

    [Structured Output](../drivers#structured-output) provides a more robust solution for having the LLM generate structured output.

[JsonSchemaRule](../reference/rules/json_schema_rule.mdx)s defines a structured format for the LLM's output by providing a JSON schema.
This is particularly useful when you need the LLM to return well-formed data, such as JSON objects, with specific fields and data types.

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

```python
import json

import schema

from griptape.rules.json_schema_rule import JsonSchemaRule
from griptape.structures import Agent

agent = Agent(
    rules=[
        JsonSchemaRule(
            schema.Schema({"answer": str, "relevant_emojis": schema.Schema(["str"])}).json_schema("Output Format")
        )
    ]
)

output = agent.run("What is the sentiment of this message?: 'I am so happy!'").output

print(json.dumps(json.loads(output.value), indent=2))

```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Logs">

```text

                             Input: What is the sentiment of this message?: 'I  
                             am so happy!'

                             Output: {"answer": "The sentiment of the message is
                             positive.", "relevant_emojis": ["str"]}            
{
  "answer": "The sentiment of the message is positive.",
  "relevant_emojis": [
    "str"
  ]
}

```

</Tab>
</TabContainer>

Although Gen AI Builder leverages the `schema` library, you're free to use any JSON schema generation library to define your schema!

For example, using `pydantic`:

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

```python
from __future__ import annotations

import pydantic

from griptape.rules.json_schema_rule import JsonSchemaRule
from griptape.structures import Agent


class SentimentModel(pydantic.BaseModel):
    answer: str
    relevant_emojis: list[str]


agent = Agent(rules=[JsonSchemaRule(SentimentModel.model_json_schema())])

output = agent.run("What is the sentiment of this message?: 'I am so happy!'").output

sentiment_analysis = SentimentModel.model_validate_json(output.value)

# Autocomplete via dot notation ü§©
print(sentiment_analysis.answer)
print(sentiment_analysis.relevant_emojis)

```

## Structure

### Rulesets

You can define a Ruleset at the Structure level if you need to have certain behaviors across all Tasks.

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

```python
from griptape.rules import Rule, Ruleset
from griptape.structures import Pipeline
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask

pipeline = Pipeline(
    rulesets=[
        Ruleset(
            name="Employment",
            rules=[
                Rule("Behave like a polite customer support agent"),
                Rule("Act like you work for company SkaterWorld, Inc."),
                Rule("Discuss only topics related to skateboarding"),
                Rule("Limit your response to fewer than 5 sentences."),
            ],
        ),
        Ruleset(
            name="Background",
            rules=[
                Rule("Your name is Todd"),
            ],
        ),
    ]
)

pipeline.add_tasks(
    PromptTask(input="Respond to this user's question: {{ args[0] }}"),
    PromptTask(input="Extract keywords from this response: {{ parent_output }}"),
)

pipeline.run("How do I do a kickflip?")

### Rulesets

You can define a Ruleset at the Task level if you need to have different behaviors per Task.

Note that when overriding the system prompt, it is your responsibility to integrate anything that goes in [by default](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape/blob/6b31c129fc19a9ba4bdb205ad9e2a40aef9b121f/griptape/tasks/prompt_task.py?plain=1#L216-L221).
You can achieve this by appending the default system prompt to your custom prompt like so:

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

```python

from griptape.rules import Rule
from griptape.structures import Pipeline
from griptape.tasks.prompt_task import PromptTask

            rules=[Rule("Your favorite color is blue")],
            generate_system_template=lambda task: dedent(
                """

                    - Discuss only topics related to skateboarding
                    - Limit your response to fewer than 5 sentences.

                Background:

                + task.default_generate_system_template(task)
            ),
        )
    ]
)

pipeline.run("What is your name and favorite color?")
