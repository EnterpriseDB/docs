## Overview

Extraction Engines enable the extraction of structured data from unstructured text.
These Engines can be used with Structures via [Extraction Tasks](../structures/tasks.mdx).
As of now, Gen AI Builder supports two types of Extraction Engines: the CSV Extraction Engine and the JSON Extraction Engine.

## CSV

The CSV Extraction Engine extracts comma separated values from unstructured text.

<Tab title="Code">

```python
from griptape.drivers.prompt.openai import OpenAiChatPromptDriver
from griptape.engines import CsvExtractionEngine

# Initialize the CsvExtractionEngine instance
csv_engine = CsvExtractionEngine(
    prompt_driver=OpenAiChatPromptDriver(model="gpt-3.5-turbo"), column_names=["name", "age", "location"]
)

# Define some unstructured data
sample_text = """
Alice, 28, lives in New
York.
Bob, 35 lives in California
Charlie is 40
Collin is 28 and lives in San Francisco
"""

# Extract CSV rows using the engine
result = csv_engine.extract_text(sample_text)

for row in result:
    print(row.to_text())

```

```text
name,age,location
Alice,28,New York
Bob,35,California
Charlie,40,
Collin,28,San Francisco

```

</Tab>
</TabContainer>

```
name,age,location
Alice,28,New York
Bob,35,California
Charlie,40,
Collin,28,San Francisco
```

## JSON

The JSON Extraction Engine extracts JSON-formatted values from unstructured text.

```python
import json

from schema import Literal, Schema

from griptape.artifacts import ListArtifact
from griptape.chunkers import TextChunker
from griptape.drivers.prompt.openai import OpenAiChatPromptDriver
from griptape.engines import JsonExtractionEngine
from griptape.loaders import WebLoader

# Define a schema for extraction
json_engine = JsonExtractionEngine(
    prompt_driver=OpenAiChatPromptDriver(model="gpt-4.1"),
    template_schema=Schema(
        {
            Literal("model", description="Name of an LLM model."): str,
            Literal("notes", description="Any notes of substance about the model."): Schema([str]),
        }
    ).json_schema("ProductSchema"),
)

# Load data from the web
web_data = WebLoader().load("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model")
chunks = TextChunker().chunk(web_data)


# Extract data using the engine
result = json_engine.extract_artifacts(ListArtifact(chunks))

for artifact in result:
    print(json.dumps(artifact.value, indent=2))
