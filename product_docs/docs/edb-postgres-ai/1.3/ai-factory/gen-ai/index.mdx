# Gen AI Builder

Gen AI Builder provides comprehensive tooling for developing intelligent applications that leverage organizational knowledge through [retrieval‑augmented generation](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/concepts/terminology/#retrieval-augmented-generation-rag) patterns. The platform operates within controlled infrastructure environments, ensuring complete organizational sovereignty over data, models, and inference operations.

New here? Start with [Getting started](getting-started), review [Concepts](concepts) and the [Architecture](architecture), then use the [How‑to guides](how-to) or jump into the [Quickstart UI](quickstart-customer-service-agent-ui).

## Platform Architecture

Gen AI Builder integrates multiple components to deliver end-to-end AI application development capabilities within the EDB Postgres AI ecosystem. The platform emphasizes data sovereignty by maintaining all operations within organizational boundaries while providing enterprise-grade governance and auditability. Explore the [assistants](assistants), [knowledge bases](knowledge-bases), [retrievers](retrievers), [rulesets](rulesets), [structures](structures), [tools](tools), [threads](threads), [data sources](data-sources), [data lake](data-lake), and [libraries](libraries) manuals.

### Core Infrastructure Integration

**Hybrid Manager Foundation**
Gen AI Builder operates within [Hybrid Manager](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/)'s Kubernetes orchestration layer, leveraging distributed computing capabilities while maintaining centralized governance. This architecture ensures consistent operational procedures across development and production environments.

**Data Estate Integration**
[Knowledge bases](knowledge-bases) connect directly to Postgres databases and object storage systems (see [Data Lake](data-lake)) within organizational infrastructure, eliminating external data dependencies while supporting diverse [data source](data-sources) types.

**Model Serving Integration**
Applications access language models and embedding models through the [AI Factory Models](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/) infrastructure, ensuring consistent governance policies across all AI capabilities.

## Architectural Components

### Knowledge Base Framework

[Knowledge bases](knowledge-bases) serve as the foundation for retrieval‑augmented generation applications by combining structured database content with unstructured document repositories. The framework provides semantic search capabilities through vector embeddings (see [Vector Engine](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/vector-engine/)) while maintaining complete data lineage.

**Data Source Integration**
- Postgres database tables with semantic indexing
- Document repositories from object storage systems
- Real-time data feeds through API integrations
- Web content through controlled scraping operations

**Embedding Management**
- Private embedding models for sensitive content processing
- Vector storage optimization within Postgres infrastructure
- Semantic similarity algorithms for retrieval accuracy
- Hybrid search combining vector and keyword approaches

### Retrieval Systems

[Retrieval](retrievers) components orchestrate search operations across diverse data sources, providing unified interfaces for knowledge discovery while maintaining source attribution and access controls.

**Retrieval Strategies**
- Vector similarity search for semantic content matching
- Keyword-based search for exact term identification
- Hybrid approaches combining multiple retrieval methods
- Contextual filtering based on user permissions and data classification

### Assistant Framework

Intelligent [assistants](assistants) combine knowledge retrieval with language model capabilities to provide conversational interfaces for organizational knowledge. The framework supports complex reasoning workflows while maintaining audit trails for all interactions (see [threads](threads)).

**Assistant Capabilities**
- Multi-turn conversational interfaces with context preservation
- [Tool](tools) integration for external system interactions
- Reasoning workflows for complex query resolution
- Audit logging for compliance and operational transparency

## Implementation Patterns

### Enterprise Knowledge Systems

Organizations implement comprehensive knowledge management systems that unify structured and unstructured information sources through semantic search capabilities.

**Typical Architecture**
1. **Data Integration Layer**: Connects multiple organizational [data sources](data-sources) including databases, document repositories, and knowledge management systems
2. **Processing Pipeline**: Transforms content into searchable formats with appropriate metadata and access control annotations
3. **Retrieval Interface**: Provides unified search across all integrated content with relevance ranking and source attribution
4. **Application Layer**: Delivers knowledge access through conversational interfaces and API integrations

**Implementation Considerations**
- Data governance policies for content classification and access control
- Performance optimization for large document collections
- Integration with existing authentication and authorization systems
- Compliance requirements for audit trails and data lineage

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation Applications

Applications combine retrieval capabilities with language model inference to provide context-aware responses based on organizational knowledge.

**Development Workflow**
1. **Knowledge Base Construction**: Establish comprehensive document indexing with semantic embeddings (see [create a Knowledge Base](create-knowledge-base) and [manage a Knowledge Base](manage-knowledge-base))
2. **Retrieval Configuration**: Implement search strategies optimized for application requirements
3. **Generation Integration**: Connect language models for response generation based on retrieved context
4. **Response Orchestration**: Coordinate retrieval and generation workflows with appropriate caching and optimization

**Technical Requirements**
- Low-latency retrieval for interactive applications
- Context window management for large document processing
- Response quality evaluation and improvement workflows
- Integration testing across knowledge base updates

### Conversational AI Platforms

Interactive applications provide natural language interfaces for complex organizational workflows and information discovery.

**Platform Components**
- Multi-modal input processing for text, voice, and document interactions
- Context management for extended conversational sessions
- Tool integration for external system operations
- Response personalization based on user roles and preferences

**Operational Features**
- Session management with conversation state persistence
- Performance monitoring for response quality and latency
- Usage analytics for application optimization and capacity planning

## Development Framework

### Knowledge Base Development

Knowledge base creation involves data source integration, content processing, and semantic indexing to support efficient retrieval operations.

**Development Process**
1. **Source Assessment**: Evaluate [data sources](data-sources) for content quality, update frequency, and access requirements
2. **Processing Pipeline Design**: Configure content transformation workflows including cleaning, chunking, and metadata extraction (see [configure Data Lake](configure-datalake))
3. **Indexing Strategy**: Implement embedding generation and vector storage optimization
4. **Retrieval Testing**: Validate search quality through systematic evaluation procedures

**Quality Assurance**
- Content accuracy verification through systematic sampling
- Retrieval relevance evaluation using standard metrics
- Performance benchmarking under expected load conditions
- Security testing for access control and data isolation

### Assistant Configuration

Assistant development requires careful orchestration of retrieval, reasoning, and response generation capabilities to deliver reliable user experiences (see [create an Assistant](create-assistant)).

**Configuration Areas**
- **Behavior Definition**: Establish assistant personality, capabilities, and operational boundaries
- **Knowledge Integration**: Configure retrieval strategies and knowledge source prioritization (see [retrievers](retrievers))
- **Tool Integration**: Connect external systems and APIs for expanded functionality (see [tools](tools))
- **Response Optimization**: Tune generation parameters for appropriate response characteristics
