description: Comprehensive reference for behavioral governance components that define assistant behavior patterns, compliance requirements, and organizational guidelines within Gen AI Builder.
---

Rulesets provide behavioral governance for AI assistants through natural language instructions that define response patterns, communication standards, and operational constraints. They establish explicit behavioral controls that complement knowledge retrieval systems to ensure consistent, compliant interactions across organizational AI applications.

## Architectural Function

Rulesets serve as the behavioral control layer within Gen AI Builder, defining how assistants interpret and respond to user interactions while maintaining organizational standards and compliance requirements. They operate at the prompt level, influencing language model behavior before response generation occurs.

### System Integration Context

**Gen AI Builder Components**
- **Assistants**: Apply rulesets during conversation processing to ensure behavioral consistency
- **Knowledge Bases**: Work alongside retrieval systems to combine factual accuracy with appropriate behavior
- **Structures**: Incorporate ruleset guidance within complex workflow operations
- **Tools**: Apply behavioral constraints during external system interactions

**Behavioral Control Layer**
Rulesets function as a middleware component that processes user inputs and assistant responses according to defined organizational guidelines. This control layer ensures consistent application of behavioral standards regardless of conversation complexity or topic variation.

## Core Architecture

### Ruleset Components

**Structural Elements**
- **Name**: Unique identifier for organizational reference and management
- **Description**: Documentation of ruleset purpose and intended application
- **Rules Collection**: Individual behavioral instructions written in natural language
- **Alias**: Optional identifier for programmatic access and versioning
- **Metadata**: Additional configuration parameters for advanced behavioral control

**Rule Definition Framework**
Individual rules within rulesets consist of:
- **Rule Name**: Descriptive identifier for specific behavioral instruction
- **Rule Text**: Natural language instruction defining expected behavior
- **Priority Level**: Implicit ordering for rule application when conflicts arise
- **Context Scope**: Application boundaries for rule enforcement

### Behavioral Application Process

**Runtime Integration**
Rulesets integrate into assistant processing through systematic application during conversation flow:

1. **Input Processing**: User messages evaluated against ruleset constraints
2. **Context Establishment**: Relevant rules activated based on conversation context
3. **Response Generation**: Language model guided by active ruleset instructions
4. **Output Validation**: Generated responses verified against behavioral requirements
5. **Consistency Enforcement**: Ongoing behavioral monitoring throughout conversation

**Rule Precedence and Conflict Resolution**
When multiple rules apply to similar situations, the system applies precedence based on rule specificity, organizational priority levels, and contextual relevance. This approach ensures consistent behavior while maintaining flexibility for complex scenarios.

## Behavioral Categories

### Communication Standards

**Professional Communication**
Rules defining appropriate tone, language formality, and interaction patterns for different organizational contexts and user relationships.

**Brand Alignment**
Behavioral guidelines ensuring assistant responses reflect organizational voice, values, and communication standards across all interactions.

**Cultural Sensitivity**
Instructions for appropriate communication across diverse user populations while respecting cultural differences and organizational inclusion policies.

### Compliance and Governance

**Regulatory Compliance**
Rules enforcing industry-specific regulatory requirements including data privacy, financial services regulations, and healthcare compliance standards.

**Information Governance**
Behavioral constraints defining appropriate information sharing, source attribution requirements, and confidentiality protection measures.

**Escalation Protocols**
Instructions defining when and how assistants should escalate conversations to human operators based on complexity, sensitivity, or regulatory requirements.

### Operational Boundaries

**Capability Limitations**
Clear definitions of assistant capabilities and limitations, ensuring appropriate expectation setting and service boundary communication.

**Error Handling**
Behavioral guidelines for managing system failures, information gaps, and unexpected situations while maintaining user confidence and service quality.

**Security Protocols**
Rules defining appropriate handling of security-related inquiries, authentication procedures, and sensitive information protection measures.

## Implementation Patterns
