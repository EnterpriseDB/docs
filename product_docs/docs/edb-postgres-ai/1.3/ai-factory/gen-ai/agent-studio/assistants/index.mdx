## What are Assistants

**Assistants** in Gen AI Builder are AI-powered agents that perform tasks, interact with users, access knowledge, and adhere to predefined behavioral guidelines.
They are the central building block for creating interactive, AI-driven applications within the AI Factory ecosystem.

In short:
**Assistants turn your Knowledge Bases, Rulesets, and Tools into useful, conversational AI experiences.**

For a deep dive, see: [Assistants explained](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/explained/assistants-explained).

## Why use Assistants

Assistants enable you to:

-   Build **interactive AI applications** quickly and reliably.
-   **Ground AI responses** in your organization’s data (via Knowledge Bases).
-   Enforce **behavioral guidelines** through Rulesets.
-   Enable advanced **task execution** through Tools.
-   Maintain **conversational memory** to support multi-turn interactions.

Assistants are the primary interface between end users and your AI Factory content + capabilities.

## When to use Assistants

-   Whenever you want to expose AI capabilities to users — internal or external.
-   When building:
-   Support chatbots
-   Internal knowledge agents
-   Financial advisors
-   Sales assistants
-   Executive assistants
-   Compliance checkers
-   When building **multi-modal Agents** that combine:
-   Natural language conversation
-   Knowledge retrieval (RAG)
-   Behavior control
-   Task execution

## How Assistants fit into Gen AI Builder

Typical Assistant flow:

User Input → Assistant → Retriever → Knowledge Bases → Retrieved Content
→ Rulesets → Behavioral Guidance
→ Tools → Action Execution (if configured)
→ Response Generation → User Output

At runtime:

-   The Assistant receives user input.
-   It retrieves relevant knowledge.
-   It applies behavioral Rulesets.
-   It uses Tools if needed.
-   It generates a response via its selected LLM.

Assistants provide a **unified layer** over all these components.

## Key features of Assistants

-   **LLM integration:** Powered by your choice of Large Language Models (LLMs).
-   **Knowledge Base connectivity:** Link one or more Knowledge Bases for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
-   **Ruleset application:** Enforce behavioral guidelines and tone.
-   **Tool usage:** (If configured) enable Assistants to perform external actions.
-   **Conversation management:** Maintain memory across interactions.
-   **Customization:** Tailor Assistant behavior, knowledge access, and generation parameters.

## Getting started

See [Create an Assistant](/edb-postgres-ai/ai-factory/learn/how-to/gen-ai/create-assistant) for a full step-by-step guide.

Typical workflow:

1.  Create an Assistant.
2.  Select LLM model.
3.  Add Knowledge Bases.
4.  Add Rulesets.
5.  Optionally configure Tools and Memory.
6.  Test and deploy the Assistant.
