Gen AI Builder Structures are Python applications that use the [Gen AI Builder SDK](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/reference/sdk) to bring LLMs into your software environment. You can create Structures in the form of agents, sequential task pipelines, and parallelized workflows.

Structures can invoke other Structures, enabling Agents to interact with other Agents to create multi-agent systems, or to invoke pipelines or workflows.

Typically, developers can easily write and debug their software locally. However, they would then need to find someplace else to host it for testing and production. With Gen AI Builder Structures, you can start on your laptop, and then deploy them directly to Gen AI Builder to run them at scale.
