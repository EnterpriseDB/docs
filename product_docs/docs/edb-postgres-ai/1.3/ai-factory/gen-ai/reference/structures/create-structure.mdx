You can host your Gen AI Builder SDK [Agents](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/reference/sdk/structures), [Pipelines](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/reference/sdk/structures/pipelines), and [Workflows](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/reference/sdk/structures/workflows) on Gen AI Builder. This allows you to run your Structures without needing to manage infrastructure.

For production use-cases, we recommend connecting Gen AI Builder to GitHub and storing the code for your Structures in one or more a GitHub repos.

1.  Connect Your GitHub Account in your Gen AI Builder account
2.  Install the [Gen AI Builder GitHub app to your GitHub account or organization](https://github.com/apps/griptape-cloud/installations/new/)
    -   Be sure to allow the app access to `All Repositories` or select the specific repositories you need
3.  Ensure your repository has a Structure Config YAML file. If your repository contains multiple Structures, each Structure must have a separate Structure Config YAML file.
    -   To learn more see [Structure Config YAML](structure-config.mdx)
4.  Navigate to the Create Structure page in the Gen AI Builder Console
5.  Select *Gen AI Builder Structure from GitHub Repo*
6.  Select the GitHub Organization, Repository and Branch that you wish to deploy from.
7.  Specify the `structure_config.yaml` for this deployment
8.  Optionally, Enable Webhook and/or add Environment Variables
9.  Click *Create* to create your Structure using the configuration details that you have entered

You can now create a Structure in the Gen AI Builder console by providing your GitHub repository information.

## Create a Structure from a ZIP file

1.  Ensure your Structure folder has a Structure Config YAML file. If your Structure folder contains multiple Structures, each Structure must have a separate Structure Config YAML file.
    -   To learn more see [Structure Config YAML](structure-config.mdx)
2.  Create a functional [Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) in your Structure folder
    -   Populating your virtual environment with your Structure's Python dependencies can be done using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/#install-multiple-packages-using-a-requirements-file)
3.  Compress the entire Structure folder into a ZIP file
    -   On Mac and Linux systems, this can be done with the 'zip' CLI command
    -   On Windows systems, this can be done with the 'tar.exe' PowerShell command
4.  Upload the created ZIP file to a [Data Lake Bucket](../data-lakes) and note the Asset Name
5.  Specify the `structure_config.yaml` for this deployment
6.  Optionally, Enable Webhook and/or add Environment Variables
7.  Click *Create* to create your Structure using the configuration details that you have entered

You can now create a Structure in the Gen AI Builder console by providing your Bucket and Asset Name from above.

### Quickstart With Samples and Templates

To get started with Structures in the Cloud, check out the [managed-structure-template on GitHub](https://github.com/griptape-ai/managed-structure-template) or deploy one of the [griptape-sample-structures from GitHub](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-sample-structures/tree/main).
