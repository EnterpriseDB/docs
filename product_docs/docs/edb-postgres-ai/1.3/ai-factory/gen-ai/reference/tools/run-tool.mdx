Tools are run by sending HTTP POST requests to the Tool's activity endpoints. Activities are defined by decorating your tool's methods with the `@activity` decorator. The activity name is the name of the method.

For example, if you deployed Gen AI Builder's provided [CalculatorTool](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/reference/sdk/tools/official-tools#calculator), the endpoint for the `calculate` activity would be `https://cloud.griptape.ai/api/tools/{tool_id}/activities/calculate`. The request body would be a JSON object with the key `expression` and the value as the expression to calculate.

```json
{
  "expression": "10**5"
}
```

Once your Tool is created and deployed, you can run your Tool one of three ways outlined below.

## From the Cloud Console

Go to the `Test` tab of your Tool to open the generated OpenAPI spec. From there, the Swagger UI can be used to create test requests.

## From the API

The API route for Tool activities is in the form of `https://cloud.griptape.ai/api/tools/{tool_id}/activities/{activity_name}`, where `tool_id` is the resource UUID of your created Tool, and `activity_name` is the name of the activity as defined in your `BaseTool` class. The activity routes will only accept an http POST method.

To fetch the OpenAPI schema, the route is `https://cloud.griptape.ai/api/tools/{tool_id}/openapi`.

```bash
export GT_CLOUD_API_KEY="<your API key here>"
export GT_CLOUD_TOOL_ID="<your tool ID here>"
export TOOL_ACTIVITY_URL="https://api.griptape.com/v1/tools/${GT_CLOUD_TOOL_ID}/activities/my_activity"

response=$(curl -X POST -H "Authorization: Bearer ${GT_CLOUD_API_KEY}" --json '{"my_key": "my_value"}' ${TOOL_ACTIVITY_URL})
echo "my_activity response: ${response}"
```

## Using the Gen AI Builder SDK

The Gen AI Builder SDK provides a [GriptapeCloudToolTool](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/reference/sdk/tools/official-tools#gen-ai-builder-tool) for interacting with your deployed Tools. Simply pass your Tool resource UUID as the [`tool_id` kwarg](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/reference/sdk/reference/tools/griptape_cloud_tool/tool#griptape.tools.griptape_cloud_tool.tool.GriptapeCloudToolTool.tool_id), and the schema and activity methods will be dynamically set on the Tool.
