You can host your [Gen AI Builder SDK Tools](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/reference/sdk/tools) on Gen AI Builder. This allows you to run your Tools without needing to manage infrastructure.

## Create a Tool from a GitHub Repo

1.  Connect Your GitHub Account in your Gen AI Builder account
2.  Install the [Gen AI Builder GitHub app to your GitHub account or organization](https://github.com/apps/griptape-cloud/installations/new/)
    -   Be sure to allow the app access to `All Repositories` or select the specific repositories you need
3.  Ensure your repository has a Tool Config YAML file
    -   To learn more see [Tool Config YAML](tool-config.mdx)

You can now create a Tool in the Gen AI Builder console by providing your GitHub repository information.

## Create a Tool from a ZIP file

1.  Ensure your Tool folder has a Tool Config YAML file
    -   To learn more see [Tool Config YAML](tool-config.mdx)
2.  Create a functional [Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) in your Tool folder
    -   Populating your virtual environment with your Tool's Python dependencies can be done using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/getting-started/#install-multiple-packages-using-a-requirements-file)
3.  Compress the entire Tool folder into a ZIP file
    -   On Mac and Linux systems, this can be done with the 'zip' CLI command
    -   On Windows systems, this can be done with the 'tar.exe' PowerShell command
4.  Upload the created ZIP file to a [Data Lake Bucket](../data-lakes) and note the Asset Name

You can now create a Tool in the Gen AI Builder console by providing your Bucket and Asset Name from above.

### Quickstart With Samples and Templates

To get started with Tools in the Cloud, deploy one of the [griptape-sample-tools from GitHub](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-sample-tools/tree/main).
