AI applications don't always need to be complex to get the job done. Sometimes, all you need is a quick way to give an LLM secure access to your data. If you'd like to build a simple chat app that has access to your data sources, create an Assistant.

Assistants are a special type of Gen AI Builder chatbot Agent Structure that can be created easily in less than a minute, without writing or deploying any code. They offer much of the same functionality provided by Agent Structures, through a simple configurable interface.
