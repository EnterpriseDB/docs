## Overview

The [Eval Engine](../reference/engines/eval) is used to evaluate the performance of an LLM's output against a given input. The engine returns a score between 0 and 1, along with a reason for the score.

Eval Engines require either [criteria](../reference/engines/eval/eval_engine.mdx#griptape.engines.eval.eval_engine.EvalEngine.criteria) or [evaluation_steps](../reference/engines/eval/eval_engine.mdx#griptape.engines.eval.eval_engine.EvalEngine.evaluation_steps) to be set.
If `criteria` is set, Gen AI Builder will generate `evaluation_steps` for you. This is useful for getting started, but you may to explicitly set `evaluation_steps` for more complex evaluations.
Either `criteria` or `evaluation_steps` must be set, but not both.

Eval Steps [
  "Compare the actual output to the expected output to identify any discrepancies in factual information.",
  "Verify that all key facts present in the expected output are accurately reflected in the actual output.",
  "Check for any additional information in the actual output that is not present in the expected output and assess its factual correctness.",
  "Ensure that the actual output does not omit any critical facts that are present in the expected output."
]
Score: 1.0
Reason: The actual output 'Glass' matches the expected output 'Glass' exactly, with no discrepancies or omissions in factual information.
