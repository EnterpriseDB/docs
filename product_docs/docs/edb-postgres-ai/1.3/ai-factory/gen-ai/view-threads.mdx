---

> Prerequisite: Access to the Hybrid Manager UI with AI Factory enabled. See /edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/ai-factory/.

This guide provides systematic procedures for accessing and analyzing conversation threads within Gen AI Builder to support quality assurance, compliance monitoring, and assistant optimization activities.

## Prerequisites

**System Requirements**
- Gen AI Builder access with appropriate thread viewing permissions
- At least one completed assistant conversation generating thread data
- Understanding of assistant configuration and expected behavior patterns

**User Roles**
This procedure applies to:
- Quality assurance teams evaluating assistant performance
- Compliance officers conducting conversation audits
- Developers debugging assistant behavior issues
- AI architects analyzing interaction patterns

## Access Thread Management

### 1. Navigate to Thread Interface

Access the **Threads** section within Gen AI Builder console. Thread management typically appears within the main navigation structure or under application management categories.

### 2. Review Thread Catalog

The thread catalog displays comprehensive conversation metadata:

**Thread Identification**
- **Name**: User-assigned or system-generated thread identifier
- **Alias**: Unique system identifier for programmatic access
- **Created**: Initial thread creation timestamp
- **Updated**: Most recent message or modification timestamp

**Navigation Controls**
- **Search Functionality**: Locate threads using keywords, aliases, or metadata filters
- **Pagination**: Navigate large thread collections efficiently
- **Sorting Options**: Order threads by creation date, activity, or other criteria

## Thread Analysis Procedures

### 3. Locate Target Thread

**Search Strategies**
- **Keyword Search**: Use conversation content or topic keywords
- **Temporal Filtering**: Filter by creation or update date ranges
- **Assistant Filtering**: Narrow results to specific assistant instances
- **User Identification**: Search by user identifiers or session data

**Search Examples**
```
Search Terms:
- "account opening inquiry"
- Assistant: "customer_service_bot"
- Date Range: "Last 7 days"
- Thread Alias: "thread_abc123"
```

### 4. Access Thread Details

Select thread from catalog to open detailed conversation view containing:

**Thread Overview Panel**
- Complete thread metadata and identification information
- Thread lifecycle timestamps and modification history
- Associated assistant configuration and version information

**Action Controls**
- Thread management operations (edit, delete, export)
- Sharing and collaboration features
- Archival and retention controls

### 5. Analyze Conversation Flow

**Message Sequence Analysis**
Review conversation progression through systematic examination:

1. **Message Navigation**: Step through individual messages using sequence controls
2. **Content Inspection**: Examine full message content and formatting
3. **Metadata Review**: Analyze message timestamps, processing duration, and system information
4. **Tool Execution Tracking**: Identify tool invocations and result integration

**Message Detail Examination**
For each conversation turn, evaluate:

**User Input Analysis**
- Intent clarity and specificity
- Context preservation across conversation turns
- Information completeness and accuracy

**Assistant Response Evaluation**
- Response relevance and accuracy
- Source attribution and citation quality
- Tone consistency with configured rulesets
- Knowledge base utilization effectiveness

**Tool Integration Assessment**
- Tool selection appropriateness for user requests
- Parameter extraction accuracy from conversation context
- Result integration and presentation quality
- Error handling during tool execution failures

### 6. Performance Assessment

**Quality Metrics Evaluation**

| Assessment Area | Evaluation Criteria |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Intent Recognition | Accuracy of user request interpretation |
| Knowledge Retrieval | Relevance and accuracy of information sources |
| Response Quality | Coherence, completeness, and helpfulness |
| Behavioral Compliance | Adherence to configured rulesets and policies |
| Tool Utilization | Appropriate tool selection and execution |

**Behavioral Analysis**
- **Ruleset Compliance**: Verify adherence to configured behavioral guidelines
- **Tone Consistency**: Evaluate communication style alignment with organizational standards
- **Escalation Handling**: Review appropriate escalation trigger recognition
- **Privacy Protection**: Confirm appropriate handling of sensitive information

## Thread Management Operations

### 7. Execute Management Actions

**Thread Modification**
- **Name Updates**: Modify thread identifiers for improved organization
- **Metadata Enhancement**: Add classification tags or organizational labels
- **Access Control**: Adjust viewing permissions based on content sensitivity

**Data Management**
- **Export Operations**: Generate thread exports for external analysis or archival
- **Retention Management**: Apply organizational data retention policies
- **Deletion Procedures**: Remove threads following established data governance protocols

**Quality Assurance Workflow**
1. Document performance assessment findings
2. Identify improvement opportunities for assistant configuration
3. Report compliance violations or policy adherence issues
4. Recommend knowledge base updates or ruleset modifications

## Practical Example: Financial Services Inquiry Analysis

**Scenario Context**
Customer inquiry regarding new savings account opening processed by financial services assistant.

**Analysis Procedure**

### Thread Location
1. Navigate to Threads catalog
2. Search parameters: `savings account opening`
3. Filter by assistant: `financial_services_bot`
4. Select relevant thread from results

### Conversation Evaluation
1. **Initial Request Assessment**
- User intent: Account opening information request
- Context: New customer inquiry with specific product interest

2. **Assistant Response Analysis**
- Product information accuracy verification
- Compliance with financial services communication requirements
- Knowledge base utilization for current product details

3. **Multi-turn Interaction Review**
- Follow-up question handling effectiveness
- Context preservation across conversation turns
- Appropriate information gathering for account opening process

### Quality Assessment Documentation
- **Strengths**: Accurate product information delivery, compliant communication tone
- **Areas for Improvement**: Enhanced eligibility requirement explanation
- **Recommendations**: Knowledge base update with current promotional offers

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Thread Access Problems

**Thread Not Found**
- Verify search parameters accuracy and scope
- Confirm thread creation completion (processing delays possible)
- Check user permissions for thread visibility

**Incomplete Message Data**
- Validate conversation completion status
- Verify tool execution logging configuration
- Check system processing status for recent conversations

### Analysis Challenges

**Performance Issues**
- **Response Accuracy Problems**: Review knowledge base content coverage and retrieval configuration
- **Behavioral Violations**: Examine ruleset configuration and enforcement mechanisms
- **Tool Execution Failures**: Analyze tool configuration and external system connectivity

**Resolution Strategies**
- Document specific issues with conversation context
- Cross-reference assistant configuration for troubleshooting
- Escalate systematic problems to development teams
- Implement temporary workarounds while addressing root causes

## Operational Best Practices

### Systematic Analysis Approach

**Regular Review Procedures**
- Establish consistent thread review schedules
- Implement standardized evaluation criteria
- Document findings systematically for trend analysis
- Maintain assessment records for compliance purposes

**Quality Improvement Integration**
- Use thread analysis findings for assistant optimization
- Identify patterns requiring knowledge base updates
- Recommend ruleset modifications based on behavioral analysis
- Coordinate with development teams for systematic improvements

### Data Management Considerations

**Privacy and Security**
- Implement appropriate access controls for sensitive conversations
- Follow organizational data retention policies
- Secure export procedures for audit and analysis purposes
- Maintain confidentiality during review processes

**Compliance Requirements**
- Document review procedures for regulatory compliance
- Maintain audit trails for thread access and analysis activities
- Implement systematic approaches for compliance violation reporting
- Coordinate with legal and compliance teams for policy adherence
