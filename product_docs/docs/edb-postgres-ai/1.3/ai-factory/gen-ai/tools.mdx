# Tools Reference Manual

Tools provide extensible action capabilities that transform passive AI assistants into active systems capable of interacting with external services, performing computations, and executing custom business logic. They serve as the bridge between conversational AI interfaces and operational systems within organizational infrastructure.

## Architectural Purpose

Tools extend language model capabilities beyond text generation by providing structured interfaces for external system integration. They enable assistants to perform concrete actions including data retrieval, system operations, and workflow automation while maintaining security boundaries and operational governance.

### System Integration Framework

**Gen AI Builder Components**
- **Assistants**: Invoke tools through language model decision-making processes
- **Structures**: Incorporate tools as workflow components within pipeline operations
- **Rulesets**: Define tool usage policies and operational constraints
- **Memory Systems**: Maintain context for multi-step tool execution sequences

**External System Connectivity**
- **APIs**: RESTful and GraphQL service integration for data exchange
- **Databases**: Direct database connectivity for operational data access
- **Services**: Internal system integration through authenticated connections
- **Workflows**: Business process automation through multi-tool orchestration

## Technical Architecture

### Tool Implementation Framework

Tools implement standardized interfaces that enable consistent integration across different assistant types and operational contexts. The framework supports both simple single-purpose tools and complex multi-step workflow automation.

**Implementation Reference**
Tools are developed using the pgai-ai-builder SDK framework available at [EnterpriseDB/pgai-ai-builder](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/pgai-ai-builder). This SDK provides the foundational classes and utilities for tool development.


### Execution Architecture

**Tool Invocation Flow**
1. **Decision Phase**: Language models determine tool necessity based on conversation context
2. **Parameter Extraction**: Relevant information extraction from user inputs and conversation history
3. **Security Validation**: Permission verification and rate limit enforcement
4. **Execution Phase**: Tool-specific logic execution with error handling and timeout management
5. **Result Integration**: Output formatting and incorporation into conversation flow
6. **Context Updates**: Memory system updates reflecting tool execution results
