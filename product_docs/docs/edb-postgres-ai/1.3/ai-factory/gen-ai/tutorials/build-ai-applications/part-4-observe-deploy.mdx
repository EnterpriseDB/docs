## Goal

Inspect agent runs and traces to ensure correctness and reliability; export artifacts for deployment.

## Prerequisites

- Agent configured and functional (Part 3)

## Steps

1) Inspect runs and traces
- Review reasoning steps and tool call results; confirm guardrails

2) Debug issues
- Adjust retriever filters, tool mapping, or directive phrasing; re‑test

3) Package and export
- Export configuration/script for integration into your app or CI/CD

## Outcomes

- Traceable, reliable behavior with documented settings
- Exported artifacts for deployment

## Next steps

- Integrate with app UI or workflows; monitor in production
