title: Part 2 — Assemble the Toolbox (Tools)
navTitle: Part 2 — Tools
description: Register the tools your agent will call — internal APIs, external converters, model endpoints, and notifications — with auth and parameter mapping.
---

## Goal

Expose the functions your agent needs as Tools with auth, parameter mapping, and simple guardrails.

## Prerequisites

- API endpoints reachable (internal and/or external)
- Any required API keys or credentials available
- Tool behavior defined (inputs/outputs)

## Steps

1) Register internal model endpoint
- Define inputs (for example, product_id) and outputs (score/rationale)

2) Register external currency converter
- Secure with API key; add usage limits if needed

3) Register manufacturer API wrapper
- Normalize varying responses; validate with example calls

4) Register notifications tool
- Provide a clear schema for message and recipients

## Outcomes

- Four validated Tools callable by your agent
- Clear auth configuration and input/output mapping

## Next steps

- Proceed to Part 3 — Bring the Agent to Life
