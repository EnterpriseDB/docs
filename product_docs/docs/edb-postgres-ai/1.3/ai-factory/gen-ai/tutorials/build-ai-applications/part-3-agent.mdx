navTitle: Part 3 — Agent
description: Configure the Agent with directive, Knowledge Bases, Tools, and model; verify multi-step reasoning and guardrails.
---

## Goal

Create the agent by combining directive, Knowledge Bases, Tools, and a model; verify behavior end-to-end.

## Prerequisites

- Knowledge Bases ready (Part 1)
- Tools registered and validated (Part 2)
- Model endpoint available (KServe or approved provider)

## Steps

1) Define the directive (goal)
- Plain language objective (for example, find underperforming manufacturer products and propose incentives)

2) Attach Knowledge Bases and Tools
- Select retriever and filters for each KB; attach tools with guardrails

3) Choose the model
- Use a private endpoint for Sovereign AI, or approved provider

4) Test the agent
- Run realistic scenarios; record observations and tune retriever/rules as needed

## Outcomes

- A working agent that can retrieve, reason, and act
- Initial observations for tuning

## Next steps

- Proceed to Part 4 — Observe, Debug, and Deploy
