navTitle: Developer quickstart
description: Create a customer service assistant in Agent Studio using a Knowledge Base and a model endpoint. Validate responses with Threads and tune retrieval.
---

## Prerequisites

- Hybrid Manager project with AI Factory enabled and entitlements for Gen AI and Model Serving. See [AI Factory in Hybrid Manager](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/hybrid-manager/ai-factory).
- Knowledge Base content or data sources available. See [Pipelines Knowledge Bases](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/knowledge_base).
- Model endpoint via [Model Serving](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/serving/) or an approved external provider.

## Steps

1) Create a Knowledge Base
- Prepare sources and chunking settings; enable auto‑processing if needed.
- Follow: [Create a Knowledge Base](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/pipeline/knowledge_base).

2) Define retrieval and governance
- Add a Retriever to control scope (top‑K, filters) and a Ruleset to constrain Assistant behavior.
- References: [Retrievers](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/reference/knowledge-bases/), [Rulesets](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/rulesets/).

3) Ensure a model is available
- Use a private endpoint via Model Serving or a permitted external provider.
- References: [Model Serving](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/model/serving/).

4) Build the Assistant in Agent Studio
- Associate the Knowledge Base, Retriever, Ruleset, and Model endpoint; add Tools if needed.
- Reference tutorial: [Quickstart — Customer Service Agent (UI)](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/quickstart-customer-service-agent-ui).

5) Test with Threads and iterate
- Validate answers, citations, and latency. Tune top‑K, chunking, and rules.
- References: [Threads](/edb-postgres-ai/1.3/ai-factory/gen-ai/threads/).

## Configuration values explained

- Retriever top‑K: Start at 5–10; increase for recall, decrease for speed.
- Similarity threshold: Raise to reduce noise; lower to improve recall.
- Auto‑processing frequency: Match your data change rate to keep embeddings fresh.

## Troubleshooting

- Hallucinations: Tighten Retriever filters and ensure embeddings are current.
- Missing citations: Confirm the correct Knowledge Base and retrieval settings.
- Slow responses: Reduce top‑K or use a faster model; verify serving resources.
