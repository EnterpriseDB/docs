When you provision a Lakehouse node, you must provide a password. You need the password to log in as the edb_admin user. The edb_admin user is a superuser account that lets you create users, roles, and grants.

HCP doesn't save this password.

You can either share the credentials for edb_admin or use it to create other users and distribute those credentials.
