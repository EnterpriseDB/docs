Prepare your destination database before starting a migration.

## Prerequisites

-   Ensure you have created a database in your destination Postgres database server.

## SSL configuration

You only need to configure SSL if you are migrating to a Postgres instance created outside of Hybrid Manager (HM). HM-managed destinations don't require this configuration.

Ensure you configure your source database server to [accept SSL connections](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ssl-tcp.html) to allow the EDB DMS Writer to connect to it. You must create a server certificate and a server private key, for example, with OpenSSL, to enable this configuration.

For **testing** purposes, the following example creates a self-signed certificate and key with OpenSSL for a PostgreSQL 17 server on Ubuntu. The bin and data directories may vary depending on your OS, [Postgres distribution](/edb-postgres-ai/databases/postgres_distributions/), and version.

1.  In your terminal, generate an SSL certificate and key:

    ```shell
    openssl req -new -x509 -days 365 -nodes -out server.crt -keyout server.key
    ```

    Follow the terminal prompts to create the files.

2.  Move the created files to the Postgres data directory, so the server has access to them: 

    ```shell
    sudo cp server.crt server.key /var/lib/postgresql/17/<data_directory>
    ```

3.  Set the required permissions for the files: 

    ```shell
    sudo chmod 600 /var/lib/postgresql/17/<data_directory>/server.key 
    sudo chmod 600 /var/lib/postgresql/17/<data_directory>/server.crt 
    sudo chown postgres:postgres /var/lib/postgresql/17/<data_directory>/server.crt /var/lib/postgresql/17/<data_directory>/server.key
    ```

4.  Modify the `postgresql.conf` file to enable SSL:

    ```shell
    ssl = on
    ssl_cert_file = 'server.crt'
    ssl_key_file = 'server.key'
    ```

5.  Update the `pg_hba.conf` file to allow local SSL connections. Add the following line: 

    ```shell
    hostssl all             all             0.0.0.0/0               md5
    ```

6.  Restart your server to apply the changes: 

    ```shell
    /usr/lib/postgresql/17/bin/pg_ctl -D /var/lib/postgresql/17/<data_directory> restart
    ```

## Create a role for CDC migration

You only need to configure a role for migration if you are migrating to a Postgres instance created outside of the HM. HM-managed destinations don't require this configuration.

The EDB DMS Writer requires certain permissions to access and be able to write data during the migration. For this, you can either use an existing superuser or create a new user with the required permissions. In this example we create a new user:

1.  Create a new role for CDC migration with `LOGIN` abilities granted:

    ```sql
    CREATE ROLE <MIGRATION_ROLE_WRITER> WITH LOGIN PASSWORD '<ROLE_PASSWORD>';
    ```

    Where `<MIGRATION_ROLE_WRITER>` is the name of the Postgres role or user to use for destination database access.

2.  Grant permissions so the user can control the behavior of replication sessions:

    ```sql
    GRANT SET ON PARAMETER session_replication_role TO <MIGRATION_ROLE_WRITER>
    ```

    !!!note

        Granting control over replication sessions is only supported on Postgres 15 and later versions. If your destination database is on Postgres 14 or earlier, you will have to use a superuser for the migration.

This is the user you will provide to the EDB DMS Writer [during configuration](/edb-postgres-ai/1.2/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/writer_reference/) via the `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__USERNAME` and `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__PASSWORD` values.
