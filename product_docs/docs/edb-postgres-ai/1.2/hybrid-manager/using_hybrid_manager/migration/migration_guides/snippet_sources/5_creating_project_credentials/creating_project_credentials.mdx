Credentials are required so you can perform data migrations. Before you can add a source or destination for a migration to Hybrid Manager (HM), you must create migration credentials. You can then use them to allow the EDB DMS Reader or Writer to connect to HM. 

You need one set of credentials per [Hybrid Manager project](/edb-postgres-ai/1.2/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/projects/).
For example, if you are using a single Hybrid Manager project for all migrations, you only need one set of credentials.

1.  On the HM Console, select the project you are using for your migration activities.

2.  Within your project, select **Migrate** > **Credentials**.

    The **Credentials** view shows all the credentials in the project in a table format. The entry for each credential displays its name, status, when it was created, and expiry date.

3.  Select **Create Migration Credential**, enter a name for your credentials, and select **Create Migration Credential**.

4.  After the credentials are generated, select **Download Credential**.

    !!!note

        This is the only opportunity you have to download the credentials. If you don't download them at this time, you will have to revoke them and create new credentials.

5.  Unzip the downloaded zip file and copy the generated folder to the host where the EDB DMS Reader is installed.

    The decompressed credentials folder contains these files: 

    -   `int.crt`
    -   `int.truststore.p12`
    -   `client.keystore.p12`
    -   `client-key.pem`
    -   `client-cert.pem`
