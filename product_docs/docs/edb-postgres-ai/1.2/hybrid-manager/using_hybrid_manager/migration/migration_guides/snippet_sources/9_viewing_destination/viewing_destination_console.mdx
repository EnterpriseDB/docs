*Destinations* are databases you connected to the Hybrid Manager using the EDB DMS Writer so you can use them for migrations.

To verify a destination has been recognized by the EDB DMS Writer and is available for a migration: 

1.  In your HM Console, select the project you are using for the current migration. 

2.  From the left navigation menu, select **Migrate** > **Destinations**.

Each destinations's view shows the database name, database type, `cdcwriter` ID, the current status, the destination type, and more.

## More information

For a description of the available data on this page of the HM Console, see [Destinations](/edb-postgres-ai/1.2/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migrate/destinations/).
