Schema migration is an essential step in database migrations. The tools you use depend on your source database, as the complexity of the process varies between different database systems.

## Oracle sources

For Oracle sources, schema migration is more complex due to the differences between Oracle and PostgreSQL. The process requires a dedicated conversion step to handle syntax, data types, and functions that are not directly compatible.

To streamline this process, Hybrid Manager provides an integrated Migration Portal. This service automates the assessment of your Oracle schema, flags incompatibilities, and includes an AI Copilot to help you resolve complex schema issues.

## Postgres source databases

Migrating a schema from a Postgres source (PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended Server on-premises or cloud distributions) is a more straightforward process. Since both the source and the HM-managed destination are based on the same technology, their schemas are compatible, eliminating the need for conversion.

You can use standard PostgreSQL tools for this task. EDB recommends using Migration Toolkit (MTK) or `pg_dump` to manually export your schema from the source database and import it into your HM-managed destination cluster.
