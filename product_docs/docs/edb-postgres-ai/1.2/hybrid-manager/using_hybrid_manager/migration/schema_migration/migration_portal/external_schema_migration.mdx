Use the [user's workspace](access_mp.mdx#project-scoped-workspace-vs-users-workspace) of the Migration Portal to assess, convert and migrate externaly-provided DDL files for Oracle database migrations.

To access the project-scoped workspace of the Migration Portal in the scope of Hybrid Manager migrations that leverage the Agent, [access the Migration Portal from the Oracle databases' detailed view](hm_schema_migration.mdx).

## Prerequisites

-   **Optional:** The administrator of Hybrid Manager has [enabled and configured the AI Copilot with the AI/LLM of your organization](../../../enabling_migration_copilot.mdx) to facilitate resolving schema incompatibilities in the Migration Portal.

## Accessing Migration Portal

Use the Launchpad app to access the Migration Portal

1.  [Access the Launchpad](/edb-postgres-ai/1.2/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/hm_overview/using-portal/#launchpad).

2.  Hover over the **Migration Portal** tile to reveal **View Service** and select the revealed button. This opens a new tab that takes you to the Migration Portal.

## Next Steps

Use Migration Portal to: 

-   Resolve any incompatibilities and complete the schema conversion. 

-   [Perform an online or offline migration](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_portal/latest/04_mp_migrating_database/03_mp_schema_migration/) of the converted schemas to a destination database.

See the [Migration Portal documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_portal/latest/03_mp_using_portal/) for recommendations and guideline on how to use the portal.
