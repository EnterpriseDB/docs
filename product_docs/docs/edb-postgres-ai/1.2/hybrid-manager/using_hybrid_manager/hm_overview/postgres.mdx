To see information about all the clusters across all the projects in your account, from the **Estate** page, select the **Postgres** tab.

## Viewing summary statistics

At the top of the **Postgres** tab, you can view cards that summarize the following aspects of your Postgres clusters:

-   **Active Alerts** — The aggregated number of high-, medium-, and low-severity alerts across all of the Postgres clusters monitored in your estate.

-   **Top CPU Usage** — Up to the top nine clusters with the most CPU usage across all of your Postgres clusters monitored in your estate. You can page through the clusters using the control at the bottom of the card.

-   **Resource Usage** — The aggregated CPU, memory, and storage usage across all of your Postgres clusters monitored in your estate.

## Clusters table

The clusters table is a list of all of the available Postgres clusters across your projects, which helps you monitor their performance, health, status, and other metrics. You can modify the view to see more or fewer columns, and you can apply filters to see only clusters of interest.

### Selecting columns to display

By default, the table shows these columns:

-   Project Name — Project that the cluster belongs to.
-   Cluster — Cluster name.
-   Management — How the cluster is managed: by appliance or self-managed.
-   Cluster Type — The type of cluster: PGD, single-node, or HA.
-   Status — Current status of the cluster: OK, Error, Caution, or Working.
-   Engine — Current Postgres distribution type this cluster is running: Postgres, EDB Postgres Advanced Server, or EDB Extended Server.
-   Version — Major version of Postgres distribution the cluster is running: 13, 14, 15, 16, or 17.
-   Alerts — Count of high-, medium-, and low-severity alerts for the cluster.
-   TPS — Transactions per second being made by the cluster and a line graph summarizing recent trends.
-   CPU  — Percentage of CPU currently used by the cluster and a line graph summarizing recent trends.
-   Memory — Percentage of memory currently used by the cluster and a line graph summarizing recent trends.
-   Disk — Percentage of disk space currently used by the cluster and a line graph summarizing recent trends.
-   Tags — Tags associated with the cluster.

You can also select the columns to display. Select the gear to open a menu with a search box at the top. Use the search box to filter columns to display using text matching. From the list of column names that are returned, select the ones you want to appear in the table. 

These are the other columns you can display:

-   \# of Alerts — Total number of alerts for the cluster.
-   \# of Cores — Total number of cores used by the cluster.
-   Conn. Usage — Connection usage as a percentage.
-   IO Wait % — Percentage of the wait events of type Input/Output.
-   IOPS — Number of input/output operations per second for the cluster.
-   Kernel Version — Platform type of a self-managed cluster.
-   Last Backup — ISO 8601 timestamp of the last time the cluster was backed up.
-   OS Version — Operating system version of a self-managed cluster.
-   Provider — ID of the CSP provider.
-   Region — Locationid for an appliance cluster.
-   Rep. Lag — Replication lag in milliseconds.
-   TDS — Total database size in gibibytes.

!!! Tip

    To reset the columns to the default set, from the gear menu, select **Reset Columns**.

### Filtering the clusters to view

You can narrow the list of clusters displayed to include the ones you're interested in using either of two techniques: 

-   Use the table's **Search** box to search by name for the clusters you want to display.
-   Use the **Filter** control to display clusters that match the following properties. Each property has a submenu for choosing the specific type or values related to the property.

    -   Cluster Type
    -   Engine
    -   Health Score Index
    -   Health Score Statistic
    -   Include Deleted Clusters
    -   Location
    -   Postgres Version
    -   Project Name
    -   Resource Type, including:
        -   Appliance — Clusters managed by the Hybrid Manager.
        -   Self Managed Postgres — Clusters that are self-managed.
        -   Self Managed Postgres Databases — Clusters with databases that are self-managed.
    -   Status

### Monitoring data staleness

To see how often the data on the table is refreshed, refer to the values provided for **Estate page > Postgres table** in [Metrics latency](/edb-postgres-ai/1.2/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/monitoring/monitoring_console/metrics_latency/).

A message under the table shows the last time the table was updated with new data.
