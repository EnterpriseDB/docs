## On HM-managed database clusters

Since [HM-managed database clusters](/edb-postgres-ai/1.2/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/hm_terminology/#hm-managed-clusters) are created in the same environment as the Hybrid Manager, their resources are already accessible. Therefore, these clusters are monitored by default, and monitoring starts as soon as their deployment is finished.

## On external database clusters

[External database clusters](/edb-postgres-ai/1.2/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/hm_terminology/#external-clusters) are either managed by a cloud service provider or by yourself. For this reason, additional steps are required to create a connection between your database cluster and your Hybrid Manager instance.

There are two types of external databases that you can monitor:

-   **Monitoring self-managed deployments** 

    To [enable monitoring on self-managed deployments](mon_with_agent), you must install the Agent and register external self-managed databases.

    **Examples:** self-managed Postgres databases you have on bare metal, or those hosted in the cloud that aren't managed by the CSP (like a Postgres database on an EC2 instance).


-   **Monitoring CSP-managed databases**

    To [enable monitoring on CSP-managed databases](mon_ext_csp), connect the database to the Hybrid Manager.

    **Examples:** Amazon RDS.

    You can also register databases with the Agent to [assess them for migration](/edb-postgres-ai/1.2/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migration_guides/oracle_to_hm_managed/).
