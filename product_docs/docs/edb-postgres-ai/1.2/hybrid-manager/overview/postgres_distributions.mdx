Selecting the right Postgres distribution when creating a new database cluster in Hybrid Manager (HM) is crucial for optimizing your database environment. EDB offers a range of options, each tailored to different needs, from open-source flexibility to enterprise-grade features and Oracle compatibility.

## EDB Postgres Advanced Server

EDB Postgres Advanced Server is EDB's most comprehensive PostgreSQL distribution. It supports features such as [advanced security](/epas/latest/epas_security_guide), [advanced SQL](/epas/latest/application_programming/15_enhanced_sql_and_other_misc_features/), high-availability and multi-master replication in combination with [EDB Postgres Distributed](/pgd/latest) and, optionally, [Oracle compatibility](/epas/latest/working_with_oracle_data). It's ideal for demanding enterprise workloads and seamless migration from cost-intensive Oracle databases.

This option is suited for:

- Enterprises migrating from Oracle databases seeking high compatibility to reduce migration costs and complexity.
- Organizations with mission-critical applications requiring advanced security, performance, and management tools.
- Businesses that need comprehensive enterprise-grade features, including enhanced auditing, SQL injection protection, and robust high availability.

## EDB Postgres Extended Server

EDB Postgres Extended Server provides specific enhancements designed for enterprise requirements, particularly in data security, for example, through [transparent data encryption](/tde/latest). It also supports advanced replication with EDB's powerful high-availability and multi-master replication solution, [EDB Postgres Distributed](/pgd/latest). 

This option is suited for:

- Enterprises requiring enhanced data-security features.
- Organizations looking to leverage EDB's high-availability and multi-master replication solutions.
- Users who want a PostgreSQL experience with additional enterprise capabilities while maintaining strong compatibility with community PostgreSQL.

## PostgreSQL

Open-source PostgreSQL is a powerful, reliable, and feature-rich relational database system. It's known for its strong adherence to SQL standards, robust architecture, data integrity, and a global community.

This option is suited for:

- Organizations prioritizing cost effectiveness and open-source freedom.
- Projects that don't require advanced security features, multi-master replication solutions, or Oracle compatibility.
- Teams with in-house PostgreSQL expertise and the resources to manage their database environment.
