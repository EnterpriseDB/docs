## Set domain variables

The Hybrid Manager (HM) cluster needs access to certain user domains during the installation.

1. Define the variable for the HM's domain name. This domain will serve as the public URL for accessing the HM Console.

    ```bash
    export PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME=<your-hm-portal-domain-name>
    ```
    
    For example, if your company's name is **Example Company** and top level domain is `examplecompany.com`, EDB recommends your portal domain name follows a similar pattern as in these examples:

    ```bash
    portal.examplecompany.com               
    portal-dev.examplecompany.com           
    portal.hm001.examplecompany.com         
    portal-hm-us-east-001.examplecompany.com
    ```

1. Set the variable for the Data Migration Service domain name (internally called `transporter`): 

    ```bash
    export TRANSPORTER_RW_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME=dms<your-hm-portal-domain-name> # Customer domain name for the EDB Postgres AI Platform Transporter RW Service
    ```

    EDB recommends deriving the DMS service domain name from your portal domain name, as this consistency facilitates managing your services, for example, by replacing `portal` with `dms`. Following the previous examples:

    ```bash
    dms.examplecompany.com               
    dms-dev.examplecompany.com           
    dms.hm001.examplecompany.com         
    dms-hm-us-east-001.examplecompany.com
    ```

1. Set the variable for the EDB Postgres AI Agent domain name:

    ```bash
    export BEACON_SERVICE_DOMAIN_NAME=<beacon service domain name> # Customer domain name for the EDB Postgres AI Beacon Service
    ```

## Set storage class variable

The HM cluster requires a predefined storage class:

```bash
 export STORAGE_CLASS=<storage class> 
```

One option is to use the default GKE storage class, `standard-rwo`.

## Set authentication variables

Some authentication values are needed for installing HM.

1. Set the variable for your email address:

```bash
export AUTHENTICATION_EMAIL=<your-email>
```

1. Set the variable for your password hash&mdash;the hashed password you obtained.
For example: `echo "mypassword" | htpasswd -BinC 10 admin | cut -d: -f`:

```bash
export AUTHENTICATION_HASH=<your-password-hash>  
```

1. Set the variable for your username.
Owner MyCompany is the default user name.

```bash
export AUTHENTICATION_USERNAME=<Owner MyCompany>
```

1. Set your user id:


```bash
export AUTHENTICATION_USER_ID="your-unique-user-identifier"
```

## Optional: set FIPs mode Transporter Data Operator

Optionally, you can set FIPS mode for the Transporter Data Operator:

```bash
export TRANSPORTER_FIPS_ENABLED=true # Enable FIPS mode for Transporter Data Operator
```
