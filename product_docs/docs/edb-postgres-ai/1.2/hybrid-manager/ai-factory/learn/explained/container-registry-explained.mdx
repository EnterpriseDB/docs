description: Understand how the Hybrid Manager Image and Model Library integrates with container registries to provide database and AI model images.
---

The Image and Model Library in Hybrid Manager (HCP) is powered by container registries.
Registries provide the actual image content for:

- **Database images** (PostgreSQL, EPAS, PGE)
- **AI model images** (NVIDIA NIM, future custom models)

Understanding how container registry integration works is key to managing and extending your Image Library.

---

## How does it work?

HCP relies on the **the Agent** to pull image metadata from connected registries.

The Agent uses **Repository Rules** to know:

- Which registries to connect to
- Which repositories to scan
- Which image tags to import

→ The Image Library UI in HCP is a reflection of what the agent has pulled.

## Key Concepts

| Concept | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| **Registry** | A container registry (ex: Azure ACR, AWS ECR, GCP GCR, private registry) |
| **Repository** | A collection of images for a given software or model (ex: `postgresql`, `meta/llama-3.3-49b`) |
| **Tag** | A version of an image (ex: `17.4-2503310734`, `1.8.5`, `latest`) |
| **Repository Rule** | A rule that tells the Agent which repositories/tags to discover |
| **HCP Tags** | Organizational tags within HCP → these are separate from registry tags |

---

## Default registries

Repositories:
- `postgresql` → PostgreSQL community images.
- `edb-postgres-advanced` → EPAS images.
- `edb-postgres-extended` → PGE images.

In customer environments:

- Customer provides a **private registry**.
- Image Library is configured to pull from that registry.

---

## Repository Rules

Repository Rules drive what the Agent discovers:

- You can add **custom repositories** via Image Library UI → "Manage Repositories."
- You can edit the Agent config for advanced control.

Example agent config section:

```yaml
dispatcher:
  capabilities:
    provisioning:
      images:
        discovery:
          registry:
            postgres_repositories:
              - name: postgresql
                description: Community PostgreSQL
              - name: edb-postgres-advanced
                description: EPAS
              - name: edb-postgres-extended
                description: PGE
              - name: postgresql-torsten
                description: Custom PG Build with AIDB
```
This tells agent which repositories to pull and display.

→ You can edit this config to add more repositories (advanced).

Private Registry Integration Flow
Add repository via Image Library UI → simplest flow for most users.

Agent pulls image list periodically.

Image tags and metadata appear in Image Library.

You can select these images for:

Database provisioning

AI model serving (via Model Library in AI Factory).

Relationship to AI Factory Model Library
Model Library in AI Factory is powered by Image Library.

All AI model images flow through this same registry → agent pull → Image Library → available for Model Serving.

This ensures consistent governance of all model images.

Summary
* Registries provide the source of truth for images.
* Repository Rules tell HCP which repos/tags to scan.
* the Agent pulls the images and updates Image Library UI.
* Private registries can be fully integrated and governed.
* AI Factory Model Library leverages this same system.
