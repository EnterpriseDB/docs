**EDB Postgres AI Hybrid Manager** is the control plane of the EDB Postgres AI Platform—a **sovereign AI, analytics, and Postgres management solution** that runs anywhere you run Kubernetes. It offers a unified experience for deploying databases, running GenAI workloads, and scaling Postgres-native analytics across **cloud**, **on-prem**, or **hybrid environments**.

It works on the follow Kubernetes distributions: **Amazon EKS**, **Google GKE**, and **Red Hat OpenShift (RHOS)**.

## One platform, full control

EDB Hybrid Manager brings together the infrastructure, data, and application layers required to support modern Postgres-based data platforms:

-   **Sovereign AI** — Build and serve AI-powered workloads using your own infrastructure, with full control over GPU resources and GenAI pipelines.
-   **Postgres-native analytics** — Offload to open data formats like Iceberg and Delta Lake while preserving Postgres compatibility and control.
-   **Operational excellence** — Simplify backup, scaling, monitoring, and cluster lifecycle management for Postgres clusters.

Whether deployed in the cloud or on-premises, Hybrid Manager ensures **observability, governance, and resilience** across your data and AI stack.

| Area                               | Capabilities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Database provisioning**          | Deploy highly available PostgreSQL or Distributed Postgres clusters using the console, templates, or declarative manifests.                                                                                                                                                         |
| **AI integration**                 | Run [sovereign GenAI pipelines](ai-factory/), serve models with KServe, and build AI knowledge bases governed by your infrastructure.                                                                                                                                               |
| **Analytics**                      | Offload cold data to [Delta Lake or Iceberg](analytics/), query with Postgres syntax, and enable hybrid transactional/analytical processing.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Monitoring and observability**   | Use the integrated dashboards that leverage Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki to obtain deep visibility into query health, resource usage, and system alerts.                                                                                                                           |
| **Security and access management** | Integrate with identity providers, define RBAC for projects and clusters, and manage secure access to your databases and services.                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Database migration**             | Migrate schemas and data from external databases (Oracle, self-managed Postgres) to HM-managed clusters. Leverage integrated services for migration and schema assessment, data transfer (snapshot), and continuous replication (streaming) to achieve minimal downtime migrations. |
