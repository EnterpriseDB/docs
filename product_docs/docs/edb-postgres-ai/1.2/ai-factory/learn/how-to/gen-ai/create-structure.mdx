---

## Who is this for

Platform users building advanced AI workflows in **Gen AI Builder** in **Hybrid Manager AI Factory**.
Typical users include developers, AI architects, and data engineers.

## What you will accomplish

You will create a **Structure** in Gen AI Builder by deploying an agent, pipeline, or workflow packaged as a Zip file.
You will configure your Structure for execution in AI Factory.

## Why create a Structure

-   Structures power **advanced AI workflows** beyond basic conversation.
-   They enable:
-   **Data transformation** for Data Sources.
-   **Task execution** via Tools in Assistants.
-   **Custom Retrieval pipelines**.
-   **Integration with external APIs** and services.
-   Reusable business logic components across AI Factory applications.

For background, see:

-   [Structures explained](/edb-postgres-ai/1.2/ai-factory/learn/explained/structures-explained/)
-   [AI Factory Concepts](/edb-postgres-ai/1.2/ai-factory/learn/explained/ai-factory-concepts/)
-   [Hybrid Manager: Using Gen AI Builder](/edb-postgres-ai/1.2/hybrid-manager/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder/)

## Complexity and time to complete

-   **Complexity**: Moderate
-   **Estimated time**: 10–20 minutes

## When to create a Structure

-   When building **custom Tools** callable by Assistants.
-   When transforming or enriching data in Data Source pipelines.
-   When implementing complex **AI pipelines** that require multi-step logic.
-   When integrating external **APIs**, **systems**, or **business workflows**.

## Pre-requisites

-   Structure packaged as a **Zip file**:
-   Includes Structure code and dependencies.
-   Contains Structure configuration (typically YAML).
-   Uploaded to your configured **Data Lake**.

## How to create a Structure

### 1. Navigate to Structures

-   In Gen AI Builder console, go to **Structures**.

### 2. Create a new Structure

-   Click **Create Structure**.

### 3. Select creation method

-   Choose **Create Structure from Zip file**.

### 4. Configure Structure fields

#### Name (required)

-   Provide a clear, unique name.
-   Example: `PGFT_TransactionCategorizer`

#### Description (optional)

-   Describe what the Structure does.
-   Example: `Categorizes financial transactions using PGFT business logic.`

### 5. Configure Data Lake parameters

#### Bucket Id (required)

-   Select the **Data Lake bucket** where your Structure Zip file is stored.

#### Asset Path (required)

-   Provide the full path to your Zip file inside the selected bucket.
-   Example: `griptape-structures/transaction_categorizer.zip`

### 6. Configure Structure Config parameters

#### Structure Config File (recommended)

-   Enter the relative path inside the Zip to your Structure Config file.
-   Example: `structure_config.yaml`

### 7. Configure environment variables (optional)

You can define environment variables that will be available to the Structure.

#### Add individual variables

-   **Type:** Variable or Secret.
-   **Name:** Example: `API_KEY`
-   **Value:** Example: `your_actual_api_key_here`

#### Import .env file

-   Optionally paste contents of a `.env` file to bulk import variables.

### 8. Finalize creation

-   Click **Create**.

The system will:

-   Unzip your file.
-   Set up the runtime environment.
-   Make the Structure available in AI Factory.

### 9. Verify deployment

-   Your Structure will appear in the **Structures** list.
-   Monitor **deployment status**.
-   You can now:
-   Run the Structure manually via the console or API.
-   Use the Structure as a **Tool** in Assistants.
-   Use the Structure in **Data Source pipelines**.

## Example scenario: Deploy a Transaction Categorizer Structure

1.  Package Griptape Structure `TransactionCategorizer`.
2.  Upload to Data Lake:

-   Bucket: `pgai-structures`
-   Path: `transaction_categorizer/transaction_categorizer.zip`

3.  Create Structure:

-   Name: `PGFT_TransactionCategorizer`
-   Description: `Categorizes financial transactions.`
-   Bucket Id: `pgai-structures`
-   Asset Path: `transaction_categorizer/transaction_categorizer.zip`
-   Structure Config File: `structure_config.yaml`

4.  Add env variables:

-   Name: `MODEL_API_KEY`
-   Value: `your_key_here`

5.  Click **Create**.

Next steps:

-   Run the Structure to verify behavior.
-   Assign the Structure as a **Tool** to Assistants.
-   Use the Structure in Data Source pipelines if applicable.

## Troubleshooting

### Structure fails to deploy

-   Verify Zip file contents:
-   Structure code is valid.
-   Structure Config file is present and correctly referenced.
-   Confirm the **Data Lake path** is correct and accessible.

### Environment variables not working

-   Confirm variables are entered correctly.
-   If using Secrets, ensure Secrets are properly configured.

### Structure not appearing as a Tool

-   Verify the Structure implements a **Tool-compatible interface**.
-   Confirm the Structure is published and available for Tool assignment.

### Structure errors at runtime

-   Review Structure logs in Gen AI Builder console.
-   Verify external API endpoints and credentials.
-   Check Structure Config settings.

## Best practices

-   Use modular, reusable Structure design.
-   Externalize configuration via environment variables.
-   Implement **robust error handling**.
-   Monitor execution performance — validate latency and throughput.
-   Version your Structure artifacts in Data Lake.
