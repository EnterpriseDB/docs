description: How to configure a Custom data source in Gen AI Builder using a PG.AI Structure to ingest data from proprietary systems.
---

## Who is this for

Platform users who need to ingest data from proprietary systems, internal databases, or APIs not supported by built-in data source types.
Typical users include developers, system integrators, and advanced data engineers who build custom pipelines and Structures.

## What you will accomplish

You will configure a Custom data source in Gen AI Builder by selecting a pre-configured PG.AI Structure that acts as a data provider. The output of this Structure will be ingested and made available for indexing into Libraries and Knowledge Bases.

## Why use a Custom data source

-   Internal data often resides in proprietary databases, APIs, or specialized data stores.
-   The Custom data source allows you to connect these systems by writing a PG.AI Structure that performs the data retrieval.
-   This offers maximum flexibility while ensuring the resulting content flows through Gen AI Builder’s ingestion and transformation pipeline.

## Complexity and time to complete

-   **Complexity**: High. You must write or have access to a PG.AI Structure that correctly implements data retrieval logic.
-   **Estimated time**: 15–60 minutes depending on Structure complexity and target system integration.

## Key considerations

### Structure design

-   The selected PG.AI Structure must be implemented and tested to act as a data source (data provider Structure).
-   The Structure should return data in a format suitable for downstream processing (typically textual).
-   The Structure should handle retries, error conditions, and paging if applicable.

### Transform logic

-   You can optionally apply a separate "Transform your data" Structure to further refine, clean, or enrich the content before indexing.

### Security and compliance

-   If the Structure connects to sensitive systems, ensure appropriate access controls, authentication, and logging are implemented.
-   Be mindful of privacy regulations and data handling requirements.

## How to configure a Custom data source

1.  In the interface where you manage data sources, select **+ Add New Data Source**.
2.  Choose **Custom Data Source** from the available data source types.
3.  Configure the following fields:

-   **Name**: Provide a clear and unique name. Example: `Legacy CRM Connector`.
-   **Description** (optional): Add descriptive context for future reference.

4.  Connect to Custom Data Source:

-   **PG.AI Structure**: Select the pre-configured PG.AI Structure that implements your data retrieval logic.
-   Example: `InternalProductAPIReader`

5.  (Optional) Configure advanced options:

-   **Scheduled refresh**: Enable this option to automatically refresh the data on a schedule.
-   Provide a cron expression. Example: `0 2 * * *` (daily at 2 AM).
-   **Transform your data**: Enable this option to apply an additional PG.AI Structure to transform the data during ingestion.
-   Select an existing Structure from the list.

6.  Select **Create** to add the Custom data source.

## Supported content

-   Determined by the output of the selected PG.AI Structure.
-   Typically textual data suitable for AI processing.

## Managing and refreshing the data source

Once created, the Custom data source can be viewed and managed through the Data Sources interface.

Actions available:

-   **Edit**: Modify the data source configuration.
-   **Refresh**: Manually trigger a data ingestion job.
-   **Delete**: Remove the data source.

You can also review the data job history to monitor ingestion performance and troubleshoot issues.

## Troubleshooting

### Structure not listed

-   Verify that your PG.AI Structure is correctly registered and marked as a data source (data provider Structure).
-   Ensure the Structure is accessible in your current project or environment.

### Fetching errors or incomplete data

-   Check the Structure’s implementation for errors, authentication issues, or unexpected API changes.
-   Review the data job history for detailed error messages.

## Example scenario

You want to ingest product catalog data from an internal REST API into Gen AI Builder.

Example configuration:

-   **Name**: `Product Catalog via Custom API`
-   **PG.AI Structure**: `InternalProductAPIReader`
-   **Scheduled refresh**: `0 2 * * *` (daily at 2 AM)
-   **Transform your data**: Apply a Structure that extracts and formats product descriptions.
