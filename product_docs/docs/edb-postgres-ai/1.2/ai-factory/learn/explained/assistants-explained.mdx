description: Understand the role of Assistants in Gen AI Builder and how they power AI-driven conversational applications in EDB PG AI.
---

**Assistants** are AI-powered agents in **Gen AI Builder**, part of **EDB Postgres® AI** (EDB PG AI).
They unify language understanding, knowledge retrieval, behavior control, and task execution to create **powerful, governed AI applications**.

Assistants enable you to build:

-   **Sovereign AI** experiences — using your data, on your infrastructure
-   AI copilots and agents with **controlled behavior** and **trusted knowledge**
-   Conversational apps integrated with **Postgres** and **Hybrid Manager**

Assistants are the primary **deployment target** for production AI applications in EDB PG AI.

## Before you start

You’ll get the most out of this section if you have:

-   Basic understanding of **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
-   Familiarity with [Knowledge Bases Explained](knowledge-bases-explained), [Retrievers Explained](retrievers-explained), [Rulesets Explained](rulesets-explained), [Tools Explained](tools-explained), and **Memory** concepts in AI Factory
-   Helpful: experience with Hybrid Manager and [Model Serving](../../model/serving)

## What is an Assistant?

An **Assistant** is an AI agent that interacts with users and systems, performing tasks based on:

-   Natural language input and generation
-   Retrieved, trusted knowledge
-   Predefined behavioral rules
-   Conversation memory
-   External tools and APIs

Assistants combine:

| Capability           | Backed by                                                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Language generation  | LLM                                                                               |
| Knowledge retrieval  | [Knowledge Bases](knowledge-bases-explained) + [Retrievers](retrievers-explained) |
| Behavior control     | [Rulesets](rulesets-explained)                                                    |
| Task execution       | [Tools](tools-explained)                                                          |
| Conversation context | Memory                                                                            |

Without Assistants, your AI Factory content — Knowledge Bases, Rulesets, Tools — remains static.
Assistants activate and unify these components into **working applications**.

## Why use Assistants?

-   Build **AI-driven user experiences** — chatbots, copilots, interactive agents
-   Combine **retrieved knowledge** with **controlled behavior**
-   Enable **multi-step reasoning** and **task execution**
-   Enforce **compliance**, **brand tone**, and **governance**
-   Provide **conversation memory** and personalized context
-   Run **Sovereign AI** — your data, governed behavior, full observability

* * *

## How Assistants work

At runtime:

1.  User submits input (text, API call, or other supported modality)
2.  Assistant pipeline executes:

```
User Input → Rulesets → Retriever → Knowledge Bases → Retrieved Content
→ Tools → Action Execution
→ Memory → Context Maintenance
→ LLM → Response → User Output
```

-   **Rulesets** define behavioral policies and tone
-   **Retriever** executes semantic search on assigned Knowledge Bases
-   **Tools** trigger external actions if required
-   **Memory** injects conversation history and state
-   **LLM** synthesizes and generates final response

* * *

## Core components of an Assistant

### LLM

-   The Large Language Model used for understanding and generation
-   Examples:
-   GPT-4
-   Claude 3 Sonnet
-   Gemini Pro
-   Custom models deployed via [Model Serving](../../model/serving)

### Knowledge Bases + Retriever

-   **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline:
-   [Knowledge Bases](knowledge-bases-explained): trusted, indexed content
-   [Retrievers](retrievers-explained): semantic search behavior and tuning

### Rulesets

-   Define **how** the Assistant behaves:
-   Tone and style
-   Policy enforcement
-   Compliance requirements
-   Branding guidelines

### Tools

-   Extend Assistant capabilities:
-   API integrations
-   Calculators, lookups
-   Internal system actions
-   External data fetchers

### Memory

-   Maintains conversation context:
-   Number of conversation turns remembered
-   Summarization or truncation policies
-   Supports multi-turn reasoning and personalization

* * *

## When to use Assistants

Use Assistants when you want to expose AI Factory capabilities through:

-   **Conversational interfaces** (chatbots, support bots, knowledge advisors)
-   **Internal productivity tools** (policy checkers, knowledge agents)
-   **Copilot-style assistants** (embedded in business applications)
-   **Custom API endpoints** driven by AI logic

Assistants are the **primary vehicle** for production AI applications in Gen AI Builder.

* * *

## Patterns of use

### Single Assistant per use case

-   One Assistant → one primary interaction pattern
-   Example: `Postgres Migration Copilot AI`

### Persona-based Assistants

-   Different Assistants for different **personas** or business roles
-   Examples:
-   `Financial Advisor Copilot`
-   `Internal Compliance Agent`
-   `Marketing Content Generator`

### Shared Knowledge + Ruleset Assistants

-   Multiple Assistants sharing Knowledge Bases and Rulesets
-   Enforce consistent behavior and compliance across applications

### Memory-driven Assistants

-   Assistants configured with advanced Memory settings
-   Ideal for:
-   Long-term user relationships (e.g., CRM agents)
-   Complex multi-turn workflows (e.g., troubleshooting bots)

* * *

## Best practices

-   Always combine **Knowledge Bases** + **Rulesets** → for grounded, controlled behavior
-   Use **Tools** sparingly — only where needed
-   Start simple → iterate on:
-   System prompt
-   Rulesets
-   Retriever tuning
-   Memory configuration
-   Test Assistants extensively before production
-   Monitor performance and **refine continuously**
-   Govern and version Rulesets and Knowledge Bases — critical for **Sovereign AI**

* * *

## Governance and Sovereign AI

Assistants in EDB PG AI enable **Sovereign AI** principles:

-   Data stays in **your databases** and infrastructure
-   Model serving is powered by your infrastructure via [Model Serving](../../model/serving)
-   Knowledge Bases, Rulesets, and Tools are fully auditable and versioned
-   Full observability is provided through [Hybrid Manager](/edb-postgres-ai/1.2/hybrid-manager/ai-factory/)  AI Factory dashboards

Assistants are designed for **production-grade, compliant, governed AI**.
