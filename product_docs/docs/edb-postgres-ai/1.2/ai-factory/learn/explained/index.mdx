Welcome to **AI Factory Explained** — your deep dive into the architecture, concepts, and components of **EDB Postgres® AI** (EDB PG AI).

EDB PG AI enables **Sovereign AI** — building intelligent applications and data products on top of your data, in your databases and data centers, with Postgres as the foundation. The platform integrates vector search, Pipelines, Gen AI Builder, Knowledge Bases, and Model Serving to give you complete control over how AI is embedded in your systems.

This section explains how it all works:

- What key concepts underlie EDB PG AI
- How the architecture fits together
- How individual capabilities like Pipelines, Gen AI Builder, and Model Serving work
- Where vector search and AI models fit within your Postgres estate

## Core Concepts

Start here to get oriented to the platform:
