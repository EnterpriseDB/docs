## Overview

Web Scraper Drivers can be used to scrape text from the web. They are used by [WebLoader](../reference/loaders/web_loader.mdx) to provide its functionality. All Web Scraper Drivers implement the following methods:

-   `scrape_url()` scrapes text from a website and returns a [TextArtifact](../reference/artifacts/text_artifact.mdx). The format of the scrapped text is determined by the Driver.

## Web Scraper Drivers

### Proxy

The [ProxyWebScraperDriver](../reference/drivers/web_scraper/proxy_web_scraper_driver.mdx) uses the `requests` library with a provided set of proxies to do web scraping. Paid webscraping services like [ZenRows](https://www.zenrows.com/) or [ScraperAPI](https://www.scraperapi.com/) offer a way to use their API via a set of proxies passed to `requests.get()`

Example using `ProxyWebScraperDriver` directly:

```python
import os

from griptape.drivers.web_scraper.proxy import ProxyWebScraperDriver

query_params = [
    "markdown_response=true",
    "js_render=false",
    "premium_proxy=false",
]
proxy_url = f"http://{os.environ['ZENROWS_API_KEY']}:{'&'.join(query_params)}@proxy.zenrows.com:8001"

driver = ProxyWebScraperDriver(
    proxies={
        "http": proxy_url,
        "https": proxy_url,
    },
    params={"verify": False},
)

driver.scrape_url("https://griptape.ai")

```

### Markdownify

!!! info

    This driver requires the `drivers-web-scraper-markdownify` [extra](..#installing-optional-dependencies) and the
    playwright browsers to be installed.

    To install the playwright browsers, run `playwright install` in your terminal. If you are using
    uv, run `uv run playwright install` instead. The `playwright` command should already be
    installed as a dependency of the `drivers-web-scraper-markdownify` extra. For more details about
    playwright, see [the playwright docs](https://playwright.dev/python/docs/library).

    Note that if you skip installing the playwright browsers, you will see the following error when
    you run your code:

    ```
    playwright._impl._errors.Error: Executable doesn't exist at ...
    ╔════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
    ║ Looks like Playwright was just installed or updated.       ║
    ║ Please run the following command to download new browsers: ║
    ║                                                            ║
    ║     playwright install                                     ║
    ║                                                            ║

    ╚════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝
    ```

The [MarkdownifyWebScraperDriver](../reference/drivers/web_scraper/markdownify_web_scraper_driver.mdx) outputs the scraped text in markdown format. It uses [playwright](https://pypi.org/project/playwright/) to render web pages along with dynamically loaded content, and a combination of [beautifulsoup4](https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) and [markdownify](https://pypi.org/project/markdownify/) to produce a markdown representation of a webpage. It makes a best effort to produce a markdown representation of a webpage that is concise yet human (and LLM) readable.

Example using `MarkdownifyWebScraperDriver` directly:

```python
from griptape.drivers.web_scraper.markdownify import MarkdownifyWebScraperDriver

driver = MarkdownifyWebScraperDriver()

driver.scrape_url("https://griptape.ai")

```

Example of using `MarkdownifyWebScraperDriver` with an agent:

            off_prompt=False,
        ),
    ],
)
agent.run("List all email addresses on griptape.ai in a flat numbered markdown list.")

### Trafilatura

!!! info

    This driver requires the `drivers-web-scraper-trafilatura` [extra](..#installing-optional-dependencies).

The [TrafilaturaWebScraperDriver](../reference/drivers/web_scraper/trafilatura_web_scraper_driver.mdx) scrapes text from a webpage using the [Trafilatura](https://trafilatura.readthedocs.io) library.

Example of using `TrafilaturaWebScraperDriver` directly:

```python
from griptape.drivers.web_scraper.trafilatura import TrafilaturaWebScraperDriver

driver = TrafilaturaWebScraperDriver()

driver.scrape_url("https://griptape.ai")

```
