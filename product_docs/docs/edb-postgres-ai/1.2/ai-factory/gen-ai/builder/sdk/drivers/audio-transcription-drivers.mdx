## Overview

[Audio Transcription Drivers](../reference/drivers/audio_transcription) extract text from spoken audio.

## Audio Transcription Drivers

### OpenAI

The [OpenAI Audio Transcription Driver](../reference/drivers/audio_transcription/openai_audio_transcription_driver.mdx) utilizes OpenAI's sophisticated `whisper` model to accurately transcribe spoken audio into text. This model supports multiple languages, ensuring precise transcription across a wide range of dialects.
