## Overview

You can use Conversation Memory to give Gen AI Builder Structures the ability to keep track of the conversation across runs. All structures are created with [ConversationMemory](../reference/memory/structure/conversation_memory.mdx) by default.

### Example

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

```python
from griptape.structures import Agent

agent = Agent()

agent.run("My favorite animal is a Liger.")
agent.run("What is my favorite animal?")

```

                             creatures. They are a hybrid offspring of a male   
                             lion and a female tiger. Ligers typically inherit  
                             physical and behavioral traits from both parents,  
                             often growing larger than either parent species.   
                             They are known for their unique appearance and are 
                             usually found in captivity, as lions and tigers do 
                             not share the same habitats in the wild. What do   
                             you find most interesting about ligers?

                             Output: Your favorite animal is a liger.

You can disable conversation memory in any structure by setting it to `None`:

```python
from griptape.structures import Agent

Agent(conversation_memory=None)

```

### Interaction With Structures

#### Per Structure

By default, Conversation Memory [Runs](../reference/memory/structure/run.mdx) are created for each run of the structure. Gen AI Builder takes the Structure's [input_task](../reference/structures/structure.mdx#griptape.structures.structure.Structure.input_task)'s input and the [output_task](../reference/structures/structure.mdx#griptape.structures.structure.Structure.output_task)'s output, storing them in the Run. Tasks that are neither the input task nor the output task are not stored in the Run.

        PromptTask("Improve the writing of this: {{ parent_output }}", id="improve"),
        PromptTask("Output this as a pirate: {{ parent_output }}", id="output"),
    ]
)

pipeline.run("My favorite animal is a Liger.")

if pipeline.conversation_memory is not None:
    for run in pipeline.conversation_memory.runs:
        print("Input", run.input.value)
        print("Output", run.output.value)

In this example, the `improve` Task is "forgotten" after the Structure's run is finished. This approach allows you to perform intermediary work within a Structure without it being stored in, and potentially cluttering, Conversation Memory.

#### Per Task

You can change when Conversation Memory Runs are created by modifying [Structure.conversation_memory_strategy](../reference/structures/structure.mdx#griptape.structures.structure.Structure.conversation_memory_strategy) from the default `per_structure` to `per_task`.

<TabContainer>

from griptape.structures import Pipeline
from griptape.tasks import PromptTask

pipeline = Pipeline(
    conversation_memory_strategy="per_task",

        PromptTask("Improve the writing", id="improve"),
        PromptTask("Respond as a pirate", id="output"),
    ],
)

pipeline.run("My favorite animal is a Liger.")

if pipeline.conversation_memory is not None:
    for run in pipeline.conversation_memory.runs:
        print("Input", run.input.value)
        print("Output", run.output.value)
        print("\n\n")

Now, each *Task* creates a Conversation Memory Run when it runs. This eliminates the need to feed the output of Tasks into each other using context variables like `{{ parent_output }}` since the output of the previous Task is stored in Conversation Memory and loaded when the next Task runs.

To blend the two approaches, you can disable Conversation Memory on individual tasks by setting [PromptTask.conversation_memory](../reference/tasks/prompt_task.mdx#griptape.tasks.prompt_task.PromptTask.conversation_memory) to `None`.

                             naturally in the wild, ligers have fascinated many 
                             with their distinctive characteristics. What aspect

Input Respond to this request: My favorite animal is a Liger.
Output That's interesting! Ligers are fascinating creatures, being hybrids between a male lion and a female tiger. They are known for their impressive size, often larger than both parent species, and they exhibit a mix of traits from both lions and tigers. While they don't occur naturally in the wild, ligers have captured the imagination of many due to their unique characteristics. What do you find most interesting about ligers?

## Types of Memory

Gen AI Builder provides several types of Conversation Memory to fit various use-cases.

### Conversation Memory

[ConversationMemory](../reference/memory/structure/conversation_memory.mdx) will keep track of the full task input and output for all runs.

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

```python
from griptape.memory.structure import ConversationMemory
from griptape.structures import Agent

agent = Agent(conversation_memory=ConversationMemory())

agent.run("Hello!")

print(agent.conversation_memory)

```

</Tab>

```

</Tab>
</TabContainer>

You can set the [max_runs](../reference/memory/structure/base_conversation_memory.mdx#griptape.memory.structure.base_conversation_memory.BaseConversationMemory.max_runs) parameter to limit how many runs are kept in memory.

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

### Summary Conversation Memory

[SummaryConversationMemory](../reference/memory/structure/summary_conversation_memory.mdx) will progressively summarize task input and output of runs.

You can choose to offset which runs are summarized with the
[offset](../reference/memory/structure/summary_conversation_memory.mdx#griptape.memory.structure.summary_conversation_memory.SummaryConversationMemory.offset) parameter.

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="Code">

```python
from griptape.memory.structure import SummaryConversationMemory
from griptape.structures import Agent
from griptape.utils import Conversation

agent = Agent(conversation_memory=SummaryConversationMemory(offset=2))

agent.run("Hello my name is John?")
agent.run("What is my name?")
agent.run("My favorite color is blue.")
