## What is a Retriever

A **Retriever** in Gen AI Builder is a specialized **Griptape Structure** that defines how your AI Assistants retrieve information from Knowledge Bases.
Retrievers enable precise, customizable information retrieval — the core of **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** workflows.

At query time, your Assistant uses its configured Retriever(s) to:

-   Search one or more Knowledge Bases
-   Select the most relevant results ("chunks") based on semantic similarity and other filters
-   Feed that context into the Large Language Model (LLM) to generate an informed response

**In short:**
A Retriever connects user queries → Knowledge Base content → AI answers.

## Why use Retrievers

-   **Ground AI responses:** Retrievers ensure that Assistants provide factually grounded answers based on your organization’s Knowledge Bases.
-   **Support explainability:** Retrieved content can be referenced in the Assistant’s responses, enabling transparent and auditable AI.
-   **Control search behavior:** You can configure which Knowledge Bases are queried, control token limits, and supply advanced metadata.
-   **Enable multi-source RAG:** Retrievers can target multiple Knowledge Bases simultaneously — useful for complex Assistants with broad knowledge scope.

## When to use Retrievers

-   Whenever you are building an AI Assistant that needs to answer questions based on internal content.
-   Whenever your content is stored in **Knowledge Bases** and you want dynamic, query-time retrieval.
-   When you want your AI application to support **semantic search** and not rely solely on the LLM’s internal training.

**Examples:**

-   Support chatbots answering questions from product documentation
-   Financial advisors surfacing policies and legal disclaimers on demand
-   Sales tools providing quick access to internal pricing documents and competitive intelligence

## How do Retrievers work

At runtime, the process is:

1.  User asks a question.
2.  Assistant forwards the query to its assigned Retriever(s).
3.  Retriever runs semantic + optional structured search across configured Knowledge Bases.
4.  Retriever returns the most relevant results.
5.  Assistant passes this context to the LLM.
6.  LLM generates a response incorporating the retrieved information.

**Under the hood:**
A Retriever is implemented as a Griptape Structure, giving you flexibility in how it performs retrieval.

See [Griptape concepts](/edb-postgres-ai/1.2/ai-factory/learn/explained/ai-factory-concepts/) for more on Structures.

## Key components of a Retriever

-   **Knowledge Bases targeted:** Determines the scope of retrieval.
-   **Max Tokens:** Controls how much content is retrieved per query.
-   **Metadata:** Optional structured data for advanced configuration or tagging.
-   **Associated Assistants:** Controls which Assistants can use this Retriever.

## Getting started

### Pre-requisites

-   One or more **Knowledge Bases** created and populated in Gen AI Builder.

### First steps

-   Create a Retriever and configure it to target your Knowledge Bases.
-   Associate the Retriever with an AI Assistant.
-   Test the Assistant to verify that retrieved content is correctly influencing responses.

See [Create a Retriever](/edb-postgres-ai/1.2/ai-factory/learn/how-to/gen-ai/create-retriever/) for the full step-by-step guide.
