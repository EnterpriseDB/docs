title: Managing Data with Libraries in Gen AI Builder
description: Understand what Libraries are in Gen AI Builder, why they matter, and how they power AI applications through Data Sources, Knowledge Bases, and Retrievers.

## What are Libraries

Libraries are a fundamental component of Gen AI Builder.
They enable you to connect, organize, and prepare your data for use in AI-powered applications.

Libraries serve as the **primary mechanism for managing knowledge sources** that your Griptape Structures — including Agents, Pipelines, and Assistants — leverage for Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) tasks.

In short:
**Libraries are the curated, organized collections of information your AI can "know" and retrieve.**

## Why use Libraries

Libraries allow you to:

-   **Centralize data** for AI: Aggregate diverse data sources into unified, accessible knowledge pools.
-   **Power Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG):** Provide contextual data to AI structures for accurate, grounded responses.
-   **Fuel Assistants and other Structures:** Make relevant content queryable and available to Griptape-based Agents and Pipelines.
-   **Simplify data management:** Manage the full data lifecycle — connection, processing, indexing — through an intuitive console.
-   **Support Knowledge Bases:** Libraries feed content into the Knowledge Bases that your AI Assistants ultimately query.

## How Libraries fit into Gen AI Builder

The content pipeline in Gen AI Builder looks like this:

Data Sources → Libraries → Knowledge Bases → Retrievers → Assistants → AI Applications

-   **Data Sources:** Raw content (web pages, documents, databases, cloud storage, APIs)
-   **Libraries:** Organize and index content from Data Sources
-   **Knowledge Bases:** Searchable layer built from Libraries
-   **Retrievers:** Define how Assistants query Knowledge Bases
-   **Assistants:** Use retrieved content to generate grounded AI responses

## Components of Libraries

### Data Sources

Libraries connect to one or more **Data Sources**, including:

-   Web Pages
-   PG.AI Data Lake
-   Amazon S3
-   Google Drive
-   Atlassian Confluence
-   Custom Data Sources (via Griptape Structures)

Learn how to configure Data Sources:

-   [Configure Data Sources](./data-sources)

### Knowledge Bases

Libraries feed content into **Knowledge Bases**, which index and optimize content for fast, semantic search.

Learn how to configure Knowledge Bases:

-   [Configure Knowledge Bases](./knowledge-bases)

### Retrievers

Retrievers define how Assistants query Knowledge Bases — selecting and formatting retrieved content for AI use.

Learn how to configure Retrievers:

-   [Configure Retrievers](./retrivers)

## When to use Libraries

Use Libraries whenever:

-   You want to manage content pipelines for AI applications.
-   You need to organize content from multiple Data Sources for use in Knowledge Bases.
-   You are building Assistants that require grounded responses based on your content.

**Common examples:**

-   Centralizing product documentation for support chatbots.
-   Building corporate policy Libraries to power HR Agents.
-   Creating Libraries of financial data to enable advanced RAG-based analytics.

## Best practices for Libraries

-   **Focused content:** Create Libraries with a clear, specific scope.
-   **Data quality:** Ensure source data is accurate, current, and well structured.
-   **Incremental additions:** Start small, expand incrementally, test at each step.
-   **Security:** Follow the principle of least privilege for Data Sources.
-   **Regular review:** Periodically review and update Libraries to maintain relevance and quality.

## Next steps

To start working with Libraries:

1.  [Configure Data Sources](./data-sources)
2.  [Configure Knowledge Bases](./knowledge-bases)
3.  [Configure Retrievers](./retrivers)
4.  Connect Libraries and Retrievers to Assistants to enable Retrieval Augmented Generation.

For procedural steps, see the How-to Guides in this section.
