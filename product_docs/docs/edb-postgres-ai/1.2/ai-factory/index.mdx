**EDB Postgres® AI** provides a scalable, modular platform to build and operationalize AI-powered applications and intelligent data products — starting from **your data**, in **your databases**, running in **your data center or cloud environments**.

At its core, EDB Postgres® AI (EDB PG AI) is designed to enable **Sovereign AI**: allowing you to build intelligence on top of your trusted Postgres data, governed within your enterprise boundaries. Your models, your pipelines, your vector indexes — all managed and controlled by you.

With EDB PG AI, you can:

-   Build and run [**Gen AI agents**](./gen-ai/agent-studio) and conversational experiences powered by your enterprise knowledge and sovereign Postgres data in [**Hybrid Manager**](/edb-postgres-ai/1.2/hybrid-manager/ai-factory/)
-   Perform [**vector search**](./vector-engine) and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** over structured and unstructured sources
-   Create [**document intelligence pipelines**](./pipeline) that ingest, process, and classify data from diverse sources
-   Deploy scalable [**model serving**](model/serving/), using GPU acceleration and enterprise observability
-   Extend Postgres with AI-driven query patterns and [**vector-native capabilities**](./vector-engine)
-   Seamlessly combine AI and analytics across Postgres, EDB Lakehouse, and other EDB-integrated platforms

**EDB PG AI is optimized for Hybrid Manager™**, with deep platform integration, governance, and observability — while many components can also run in other EDB Postgres environments (on-prem or cloud) with the right licensing and architecture.

## Why Sovereign AI?

EDB PG AI enables you to create **Sovereign AI solutions** that respect your data ownership, security, and governance requirements:

-   Operate on **your data** — in your Postgres databases and EDB analytics lakes
-   Train and serve **your models**, under your control — no opaque third-party APIs required
-   Deploy **where you need** — in Hybrid Manager, on-prem data centers, or in your cloud tenancy
-   Integrate AI, analytics, and operational data into unified, governed architectures
-   Audit, monitor, and control the full lifecycle of AI workloads — from ingestion to inference

By combining Postgres, modern AI pipelines, and scalable model serving in a fully governed architecture, EDB PG AI helps you unlock AI innovation **without compromising trust or compliance**.

* * *

## What You Can Build

EDB PG AI is designed to help you create intelligent applications and systems **on top of your trusted data** — with Postgres at the center.

You can build:

-   **Enterprise knowledge assistants** powered by Gen AI and Postgres-native [**vector search**](./vector-engine)
-   **AI-powered search portals** that integrate structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data
-   **Document processing pipelines** with [**Pipelines**](./pipeline), OCR, summarization, classification, and extraction
-   **Conversational applications** for both internal users and external customers, built with [**Gen AI Builder**](./gen-ai/builder)
-   **ML/AI-powered data apps** exposing [**model-serving APIs**](model/serving/) for search, recommendations, NLP, and vision
-   **Intelligent automation** embedded in business systems and workflows — driven by your data
-   **RAG architectures** combining Postgres, Lakehouse, and Gen AI to deliver trusted answers
