The **Model Library** in **EDB Postgres® AI** (EDB PG AI) allows you to manage and govern AI model images — providing a trusted foundation for **Pipelines**, **Model Serving**, **Knowledge Bases**, and **Gen AI Builder**.

> **Important:** The Model Library is a capability of the [Hybrid Manager Asset Library](../../hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/image-management/asset-library.mdx).
> It requires Hybrid Manager to be installed. The Asset Library manages all model image metadata and lifecycle.

## Why Use the Model Library?

Models power nearly every capability of EDB PG AI — but uncontrolled models introduce risk:

-   **Governance** — Ensure only approved models are deployed
-   **Auditability** — Track model image versions and provenance
-   **Consistency** — Guarantee model version alignment across Pipelines, Knowledge Bases, and Gen AI assistants
-   **Sovereignty** — Use private models that remain under your control

## What You Can Do

With the Model Library you can:

-   **Register models** — Add model images to the Hybrid Manager Asset Library
-   **Manage metadata** — Tag models with version, license, and usage attributes
-   **Integrate private registries** — Connect external model image registries
-   **Control lifecycle** — Track model versions and deprecate old models
-   **Enable model serving** — Make models available for deployment via [Model Serving](serving/)
-   **Support Pipelines and Knowledge Bases** — Use registered models for embedding pipelines and Gen AI Builder functionality

## How It Works

-   Model images are registered in the [Hybrid Manager Asset Library](../../hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/image-management/asset-library.mdx)
-   Metadata about models is stored and versioned in the Asset Library
-   Models can be referenced from:
-   [Model Serving](serving/)
-   [AI Accelerator Pipelines](/edb-postgres-ai/1.2/ai-factory/pipeline/)
-   [Gen AI Builder](/edb-postgres-ai/1.2/ai-factory/gen-ai/builder/)

EDB PG AI ensures that **only models in the governed Model Library** can be used in critical AI serving paths.

## When to Use

You should use the Model Library:

-   To govern and track model usage across EDB PG AI
-   When you want to control which models can be used for RAG, Pipelines, and assistants
-   To integrate your own private model images into EDB PG AI workloads
-   When operating in **Sovereign AI** environments where model provenance matters
