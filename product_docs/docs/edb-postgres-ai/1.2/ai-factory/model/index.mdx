**AI Factory Models** is a core part of **EDB Postgres® AI** (EDB PG AI), giving you control over the entire lifecycle of your AI models:

-   Manage and govern model assets in your [Asset Library](library/)
-   Deploy and scale inference services with [Model Serving](serving/)
-   Power Gen AI assistants, Pipelines, and RAG use cases
-   Enable **Sovereign AI** — using your models, your data, your infrastructure

## Why Manage Models in EDB PG AI?

**AI model management and serving is the foundation of trusted, governed AI.** EDB PG AI allows you to:

-   Run inference in your clusters or controlled environments (Hybrid Manager-optimized)
-   Use models in Pipelines, Knowledge Bases, and Gen AI applications
-   Integrate private, commercial, or open source models
-   Maintain auditability and control over model usage

This enables enterprises to build **Sovereign AI** systems where models, data, and usage stay within trusted boundaries.

## What You Can Do

-   Manage model images and metadata in [Asset Library](library/)
-   Deploy models for inference via KServe and [Model Serving](serving/)
-   Track, update, and control model-serving infrastructure
-   Integrate models into AI Factory Pipelines and Gen AI Builder
-   Build hybrid architectures using private + external models

## When to Use AI Factory Models

-   You want to run **private model inference** in your own clusters
-   You want **full governance** of models powering Pipelines and Knowledge Bases
-   You need **trusted RAG** workflows where embeddings match known models
-   You want to integrate specialized models into Gen AI apps and search
-   You want to provide **internal APIs** for model inferencing
