- Support for external models with OpenAI API.
- Secure management of API credentials via postgres "user mapping" feature.
- Model registry that allows configuring internal/external models.
- pgfs/volumes allows working with external data from S3 object stores and file systems.
- Low-level primitives for models: encode, transform for image and text data.
- Enhanced retriever concept for data retrieval.
- Support image and text data, including: Postgres tables, external storage, and ad-hoc queries.
- Support for building fully custom AI workflows/pipelines.
