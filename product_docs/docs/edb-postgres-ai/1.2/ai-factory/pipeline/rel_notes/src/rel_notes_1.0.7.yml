  - Support for external models with OpenAI API.
  - Secure management of API credentials via postgres "user mapping" feature.
  - Model registry that allows configuring internal/external models.
  - pgfs/volumes allows working with external data from S3 object stores and file systems.
  - Low-level primitives for models: encode, transform for image and text data.
  - Enhanced retriever concept for data retrieval.
  - Support image and text data, including: Postgres tables, external storage, and ad-hoc queries.
  - Support for building fully custom AI workflows/pipelines.
relnotes:
- relnote: Integrated model runtime

- relnote: PGFS allows working with external data from S3 object stores and file systems
  details: |
    The tech preview could only work with S3 in retrievers. Now, the volume concept allows working with external data in general.

- relnote: Enhanced retriever concept for data retrieval
  details: |
    Retriever concept has been enhanced:
      - Calls can now return rich table results with data such as vector distance.
      - Flexible interface allows "retrieving" just the key or the source data. 
      - Enables integration with custom workflows/pipelines.

- relnote: Support image and text data
  details: |
    Images can be retrieved from
    - External storage or Postgres tables.
    - Images can also be retrieved from "bytea columns" in Postgres tables
    - Also able to be retrieved ad-hoc in a query.

- relnote: Support for building fully custom AI workflows/pipelines
  details: |
    - direct SQL access to models (encode, transform, â€¦) even allowing batch-execution
    - flexible interfaces in our high-level composite functions (like retrieve)
    - allowing direct access to all low-level interfaces that we use in high-level functions; such as exposing functions like "embed_single_row"
