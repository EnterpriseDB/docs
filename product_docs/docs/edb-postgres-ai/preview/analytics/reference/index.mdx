Postgres Analytics Accelerator (PGAA) is a Postgres extension that boosts analytical query performance by replicating Postgres data to Iceberg or Delta Lake tables and then querying it with an embedded analytical engine based on Apache DataFusion.

It's built on top of Postgres, so you can use your existing Postgres knowledge and tools.

To get the best experience with Lakehouse, follow the [quick start](/edb-postgres-ai/current/analytics/quick_start.mdx) to query benchmarking data.
Then you can try loading your own data and [query Delta Lake tables](/edb-postgres-ai/current/analytics/how-to-lakehouse-read-with-without-catalog).

This section details some of the important things to know:

-   [Benchmarking datasets](/edb-postgres-ai/current/analytics/reference/datasets.mdx)
-   [Queries in Lakehouse](/edb-postgres-ai/current/analytics/reference/queries.mdx)
-   [Delta Table tools](/edb-postgres-ai/current/analytics/reference/delta_tables.mdx)
-   [DirectScan and fallback modes](/edb-postgres-ai/current/analytics/reference/directscan.mdx)
-   [Users](/edb-postgres-ai/current/analytics/reference/users.mdx)
-   [Loading data](/edb-postgres-ai/current/analytics/reference/loadingdata.mdx)
-   [Functions](/edb-postgres-ai/current/analytics/reference/functions.mdx)
