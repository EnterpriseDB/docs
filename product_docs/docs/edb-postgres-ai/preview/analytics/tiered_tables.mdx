description: Understand how writing Postgres data to lakehouse table enables cost-efficient data lifecycle management
---

Integrate EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) with Analytics Accelerator lakehouse to manage your data lifecycle by moving Postgres data from expensive transactional storage to cost-effective object storage while maintaining transparent query access.

This architecture implements two distinct storage tiers optimized for different access patterns:

- **Hot Tier** stores current operational data requiring sub-millisecond latency and full transactional capabilities in PostgreSQL storage.
- **Cold Tier** holds historical data in columnar formats optimized for analytical queries, such as Apache Iceberg® or Delta Lake, in object storage.

## Why use PGD data tiering

Unify data management and analytics by separating active data from historical data, optimizing both cost and speed.

**Cost & Storage Efficiency** 
- Reduce your transactional database size by moving historical data to a low-cost data lake.
- Reduce storage costs and improve operational efficiency since smaller databases backup faster, require less storage, and restore more quickly during disaster recovery.
- Track storage statistics and size reduction, quantify cost savings, and monitor the partition lifecycle.

**Performance & Query Access**
- Optimize queries through partition pruning (instantly discarding irrelevant partitions) and parallel processing across both storage tiers.
- Run queries on the fastest available engine utilizing standard PostgreSQL processing for recent "hot" data, and the Analytics Accelerator's vectorized engine for compressed, columnar "cold" data in object storage.
- Improve efficiency of active data by removing historical data, resulting in more efficient indexes, faster background operations, and improved cache hit rates.
- Merge results transparently, presenting a unified dataset to applications.

**Data Integrity**
- Drive efficient lifecycle management and ensure consistent visibility across the PGD cluster by utilizing comprehensive metadata to track all partition locations, offload timestamps, and lifecycle states.
- Improve cluster reliability and maintain data integrity with automatic retries and rollbacks for failed offload operations.

## Use cases

  - **Regulatory Compliance**: Maintain lean, high-performance transactional systems by offloading aged data. Ensure regulatory compliance through complete, long-term data retention and maintenance of comprehensive audit trails.
  - **Time-Series Analytics (IoT Platforms)**: Optimize data management for sensor and event streams. Ensure operational dashboards access recent, "hot" data while historical analytics utilize aggregated, cost-effective "cold" data.
  - **Financial Services**: Cost-efficiently manage massive transaction histories that must be retained for years due to regulatory requirements but are rarely queried.
  - **Retail & Seasonal Business Cycles**: Manage order histories by setting adaptive tiering policies, ensuring order data from peak seasons remains hot longer to support customer service and extended return periods.

## How to configure PGD data tiering

There are three distinct methods for managing data lifecycle and offloading data from your PGD cluster to object storage for analytics, based on your requirements.

### Automated Tiered Tables

This method enables tiered storage within a table by automatically creating new partitions and offloading old data based on a specified threshold. It leverages PGD AutoPartition to perofmr automatic analytics offload to object storage. 

The PGD Task Manager automatically monitors the age of the table's partitions. When a partition becomes older than the defined offload period, it bulk-copies the entire partition to the object store, and then truncates it locally.

The main benefit of this method is zero-touch data lifecycle management that optimizes storage costs. 

### Analytics Replication

Use this method to continuously synchronize an entire table in near real-time with an analytical copy in object storage, regardless of the age of the data.

The system uses continuous logical replication that captures every DML operation on the table and streams it to the external object storage destination.

This method converts your origin heap table is converted to an HTAP type. An HTAP table is a heap table that is mapped to an analytics table at the destination object storage where PGD replicates any changes. 

You may also configure replication for partitions within a tiered table newer than the threshold offload period.

The main benefit is near real-time, analytical replica of an entire transactional table for immediate analytics.

Disable replication to switch the table back to heap and only use transactional storage.

### Table Offload

This method provides a one-time, surgical way to clear local storage by offloading all existing data from a table to object store. You can only perform this operation on tables that are already set with replication (HTAP tables).

The system converts a replicated HTAP table into PGAA table. A PGAA table is a pure, cold analytics table in object storage, available in the Delta or Iceberg format. This process truncates the local copy, effectively eliminating local storage overhead.

The main benefit is a rapid release of local disk space for tables that are no longer actively transactional.

Restore the table back to HTAP to recreate that local storage and resume replication.

Method | Purpose | Use case | Origin Table | Destination table 
----------|-----------------------------|---------------- | ----- | -------
Tiered tables | Automated <br />Lifecycle Management | High-volume time-series<br /> data where historical retention<br /> is critical and automated. | Heap | Heap/HTAP (hot partition)<br /> PGAA (cold partition)
Replication | Continuous <br />Synchronization | Replicating a transactional table<br /> in near real-time for general analytics. | Heap | HTAP 
Offload | Selective<br /> Archiving | One-time, surgical removal and<br /> archival of a specific table. | HTAP | PGAA

### Other operations

**Trigger compaction**

Perform a trigger compaction to improve the performance and storage efficiency of your external analytics tables residing in object storage.

Compaction optimizes performance by consolidating the multiple small Parquet files created during offloading an replication into fewer, larger, and more compressed files, similar to an `OPTIMIZE` command.

**Metadata management**

There are two primary ways to manage the metadata of your object store tables:

- **No-catalog offload**: The metadata is stored alongside the data files and managed directly by the object storage file system. PGD uses the PGFS extension to connect directly to the object storage.

- **Catalog-managed offload**: This method decouples the data from the metadata. The metadata is stored and managed by a centralized service, such as Iceberg REST, creating a universal registry that allows Postgres and other tools (like Spark or Trino) to query the same data lake tables. When you offload data, the system writes the Parquet files to object storage, but registers the table's metadata in the external catalog. 

## Operational Considerations

Ensure cost efficiency and high availability by proactively managing your systems.

**Management & Planning**
- **Monitoring** partition growth rates, offload success rates, and query patterns across tiers.
  - **Dashboards** track storage utilization trends and validate cost savings.
  - **Query performance monitoring** differentiates between tier-local and cross-tier queries to guide policy adjustments.
- **Capacity** planning is necessary for both the Hot Tier (local ingestion rates) and the Cold Tier (predictable growth in object storage).
- **Workload Scheduling** for offload and restore operations during maintenance windows to minimize impact on production.

**Maintenance & Resilience**
- **Routine Maintenance** through regular jobs such as partition merging in cold storage, and orphan file cleanup to ensure ongoing efficiency.
- **Backup Strategy** must account for the distributed nature of the data, with different frequencies for the Hot Tier and reliance on the durability guarantees of object storage for the Cold Tier.
- **Reversibility** for all offload operations through restore operations, which maintains organizational confidence and allows historical data to be temporarily accessed transactionally when needed.
