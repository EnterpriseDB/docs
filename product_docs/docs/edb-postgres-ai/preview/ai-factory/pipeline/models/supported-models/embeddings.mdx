## About embeddings

OpenAI embeddings is a text-embedding model that enables use of any OpenAI API-compatible text-embedding model. It's suitable for text classification, clustering, and other text-embedding tasks.

Based on the name of the model, the model provider sets defaults accordingly:

* When invoked as `embeddings` or `openai_embeddings`, the model provider defaults to using the OpenAI API.

* When invoked as `nim_embeddings`, the model provider defaults to using the NVIDIA NIM API.

## Supported aidb operations

* encode_text
* encode_text_batch

## Supported models

* Any text-embedding model that's supported by the provider.

### Supported OpenAI models

* Any text-embedding model that's supported by OpenAI. This includes `text-embedding-3-small`, and `text-embedding-ada-002`. See a list of supported OpenAI models [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings#embedding-models).
* The default is `text-embedding-3-small`.

### Supported NIM models

* [nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nv-embedqa-e5-v5) (default)

## Creating the default with OpenAI model

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model('my_openai_embeddings',
                            'openai_embeddings',
                            credentials=>'{"api_key": "sk-abc123xyz456def789ghi012jkl345mn"'::JSONB);
```

As this example is defaulting the model to `text-embedding-3-small`, you don't need to specify the model in the configuration. But you do need to pass an OpenAI API key in the credentials. For that, you must pass credentials as a named parameter.

## Creating a specific model

You can create any supported OpenAI embedding model using the `aidb.create_model` function. This example creates a `text-embedding-3-small` model with the name `my_openai_model`:

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_model(
  'my_openai_model',
  'openai_embeddings',
  '{"model": "text-embedding-3-small"}'::JSONB,
  '{"api_key": "sk-abc123xyz456def789ghi012jkl345mn"}'::JSONB
);
```

Because this example is passing the configuration options and the credentials, unlike the previous example, you don't need to pass the credentials as a named parameter.

## Model configuration settings

The following configuration settings are available for OpenAI models:

* `model` &mdash; The OpenAI model to use.
* `url` &mdash; The URL of the model to use. This value is optional and can be used to specify a custom model URL.
  * If `openai_embeddings` (or `embeddings`) is the `model`, `url` defaults to `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/embeddings`.
  * If `nim_embeddings` is the `model`, `url` defaults to `https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/chat/embeddings`.
* `max_concurrent_requests` &mdash; The maximum number of concurrent requests to make to the OpenAI model. The default is `25`.
* `max_batch_size` &mdash; The maximum number of records to send to the model in a single request. The default is `50.000`.

### Batch and parallel processing

The model providers for `embeddings`, `openai_embeddings`, and `nim_embeddings` support sending batch requests as well as concurrent requests.
The settings `max_concurrent_requests` and `max_batch_size` control this behavior. When a model provider receives a set of records (for example, from a knowledge base pipeline) the following happens:

* Assume the knowledge base pipeline is configured with batch size 10.000. The model provider is configured with `max_batch_size=1000` and `max_concurrent_requests=5`.
* The provider collects up to 1000 records and sends them in a single request to the model.
* It sends 5 such large requests concurrently, until no more input records are left.
* In this example, the provider needs to send/receive 10 batches in total.
  * After sending the first 5, it waits for the responses to return.
  * Once a response is received, another request can be sent.
  * This means the provider won't wait for all 5 to return before sending off the next 5. Instead, it always keeps up to 5 requests in flight.

!!! Note
The settings `max_concurrent_requests` and `max_batch_size` can have a significant impact on model performance. But they highly depend on
the hardware and infrastructure.

We recommend leaving the defaults in place and [tuning the performance via the knowledge base pipeline batch size.](../../knowledge_base/performance_tuning)
The default `max_batch_size` of 50.000 is intentionally high to allow the pipeline to control the actual size of the batches.

### Model credentials

The following credentials may be required by the service providing these models. Note: `api_key` and `basic_auth` are exclusive. You can use only one of these two options:

* `api_key` &mdash; The API key to use for Bearer Token authentication. The api_key will be sent in a header field as `Authorization: Bearer <api_key>`.
* `basic_auth` &mdash; credentials for HTTP Basic authentication. The credentials provided here will be sent verbatim as `Authorization: Basic <basic_auth>`. If your server requires username/password with HTTP Basic authentication, use the syntax `username:password`. If only a token is required, only provide the token.
