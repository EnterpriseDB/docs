## Background

You can optimize performance (that is, throughput of embeddings per second) by changing pipeline and model settings.

Knowledge base piplines process collections of individual records (rows in a table or objects in a volume). Rather than processing each record individually and sequentially, or processing all of them concurrently,
AIDB offers batch processing. All the batches get processed sequentially, one after the other. Within each batch, records get processed concurrently wherever possible.

- [Pipeline `batch_size`](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/pipeline/capabilities/auto-processing) determines the number of records in each batch.
- Some model providers have configurable internal batch/parallel processing. We recommend leaving these setting at the default values and using the pipeline batch size to control execution.

!!! Note
Vector indexing also has an impact on pipeline performance. You can disable the vector by using `index_type => 'disabled'` to exclude it from your measurements.
!!!

## Testing and tuning performance

This example first sets up test data and a knowledge base pipeline, then measures and tunes the batch size.

### 1) Create a table and insert test data

The actual data content length has some impact on model performance. You can use longer text to test that.

```sql
CREATE TABLE test_data_10k (id  INT PRIMARY KEY, msg TEXT NOT NULL);

INSERT INTO test_data_10k (id, msg) SELECT generate_series(1, 10000) AS id, 'hello world';
```

### 2) Create a knowledge base pipeline

The optimal batch size may be very different for different models. Measure and tune the batch size for each different model you want to use.

```sql
SELECT aidb.create_table_knowledge_base(
    name => 'perf_test',
    model_name => 'dummy',  -- use the model you want to optimize for
    source_table => 'test_data_10k',
    source_data_column => 'msg',
    source_data_format => 'Text',
    index_type => 'disabled', -- optionally disable vector indexing to include/exclude it from the measurement
    auto_processing => 'Disabled',  -- we want to manually run the pipeline to measure the runtime
    batch_size => 100  -- this is the paramter we will tune during this test
);
__OUTPUT__
INFO:  using vector table: public.perf_test_vector
NOTICE:  index "vdx_perf_test_vector" does not exist, skipping
NOTICE:  auto-processing is set to "Disabled". Manually run "SELECT aidb.bulk_embedding('perf_test');" to compute embeddings.
 create_table_knowledge_base
-----------------------------
 perf_test
(1 row)
```

### 3) Run the pipeline, measure the performance

This test uses psql. (The `\timing on` command is a feature in psql.) If you use a different interface, find out how it can display timing information.

```sql
\timing on
__OUTPUT__
Timing is on.
```

Now run the pipeline:

```sql
SELECT aidb.bulk_embedding('perf_test');
__OUTPUT__
INFO:  perf_test: (re)setting state table to process all data...
INFO:  perf_test: Starting... Batch size 100, unprocessed rows: 10000, count(source records): 10000, count(embeddings): 0
INFO:  perf_test: Batch iteration finished, unprocessed rows: 9900, count(source records): 10000, count(embeddings): 100
INFO:  perf_test: Batch iteration finished, unprocessed rows: 9800, count(source records): 10000, count(embeddings): 200
...
INFO:  perf_test: Batch iteration finished, unprocessed rows: 0, count(source records): 10000, count(embeddings): 10000
INFO:  perf_test: finished, unprocessed rows: 0, count(source records): 10000, count(embeddings): 10000
 bulk_embedding
----------------

(1 row)

Time: 207161,174 ms (03:27,161)
```

### 4) Tune the batch size

You can use this call to adjust the batch size of the pipeline. This example increases the batch size by 10x to 1000 records:

```sql
SELECT aidb.set_auto_knowledge_base('perf_test', 'Disabled', batch_size=>1000);
```

Run the pipeline again.

!!! Note
When using a Postgres table as the source, with auto-processing disabled, AIDB has no means to detect changes in the source data. So each bulk_embedding call has to reprocess everything.

This is convenient for performance testing.

If you want to measure performance with a volumes source, delete and re-create the knowledge base between each test. AIDB can detect changes on volumes even with auto-processing disabled.

!!!
```sql
SELECT aidb.bulk_embedding('perf_test');
__OUTPUT__
INFO:  perf_test: (re)setting state table to process all data...
INFO:  perf_test: Starting... Batch size 1000, unprocessed rows: 10000, count(source records): 10000, count(embeddings): 10000
...
INFO:  perf_test: finished, unprocessed rows: 0, count(source records): 10000, count(embeddings): 10000
 bulk_embedding
----------------

(1 row)

Time: 154276,486 ms (02:34,276)
```


## Conclusion

In this test, the pipeline took 02:34 min with batch size 1000 and 03:27 min with size 100. You can continue testing larger sizes until performance no longer improves or even declines.
