navTitle: Hub Map
description: A one-screen map of the AI Factory hub to help you find concepts, how-tos, and references fast — and understand how the Hybrid Manager spoke relates.

Use this page to jump directly to what you need. Each tile links to the right place in the hub or the Hybrid Manager spoke. For prerequisites and where components run, see the AI Factory landing page.

## Start here

- Concepts: Understand the architecture and components
  - [AI Factory Concepts](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/concepts)
  - [Terminology](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/concepts/terminology)
- Learning: Follow guided paths and use cases
  - [Learning Paths 101/201/301](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/learn/learning-paths)
  - [Use Cases](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/learn/use-cases) and [Industry Solutions](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/learn/solutions)

## Build with AI Factory

- Gen AI (assistants, rulesets, tools, threads)
  - [Gen AI hub](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/gen-ai)
  - [Agent Studio quickstart](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/gen-ai/quickstart-customer-service-agent-ui)
- Pipelines (RAG, knowledge bases, auto‑processing)
  - [Pipelines](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/pipeline)
  - [Knowledge Bases](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/pipeline/knowledge_base)
- Vector Engine (vector search in Postgres)
  - [Vector Engine](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/vector-engine)
- Model (serving + library)
  - [Model Serving](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/model/serving/)
  - [Asset Library](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/model/library)

## Hybrid Manager

- AI Factory in Hybrid Manager: Governed operations, observability, GPUs
  - [Spoke root](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/ai-factory)
  - [Gen AI in HM](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/ai-factory/gen-ai/)
  - [Model Serving in HM](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/ai-factory/models)
  - [GPU management in HM](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/ai-factory/gpu-recommended)

## Where it runs and prerequisites

- Where AI Factory runs (Hybrid Manager first; selected components outside HM)
  - [See landing page: Where it runs](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/#where-ai-factory-runs)
- Prerequisites (entitlements, GPUs where applicable)
  - [See landing page: Prerequisites](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/#prerequisites)
