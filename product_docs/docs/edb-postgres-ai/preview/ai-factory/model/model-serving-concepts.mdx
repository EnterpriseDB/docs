---

**Model Serving** is a core capability of **EDB Postgres® AI** (EDB PG AI), enabling scalable, flexible, and high-performance serving of AI models on Kubernetes.

It powers:

-   Gen AI applications
-   Intelligent retrieval systems
-   Advanced data pipelines

Model Serving is implemented using **KServe**, an open-source Kubernetes-native engine for standardized model inferencing. AI Factory integrates KServe with **Hybrid Manager** to provide enterprise-grade lifecycle management, security, and observability.

**Key to Sovereign AI:**
Models run **on your Kubernetes clusters**, under your control, with full observability and governance.

## Before you start

Prerequisites for understanding Model Serving:

-   Familiarity with **Kubernetes basics** (pods, services, deployments)
-   Understanding of **InferenceService** as a Kubernetes CRD
-   Awareness of **Model Library** and how models are registered and deployed
-   Understanding of **Sovereign AI principles** in EDB PG AI

-   [Model Library Explained](model-library-explained)

## Why it matters

Model Serving enables your **AI models** and **Postgres data** to work together seamlessly — securely and scalably — under **Sovereign AI** principles:

-   Deploy **open-source or commercial models** to your Kubernetes cluster.
-   Serve Gen AI models for **Assistants**, **Knowledge Bases**, and **RAG** pipelines.
-   Support **multi-modal retrieval** (text, image, hybrid search).
-   Optimize performance with **GPU acceleration** and server-side batching.
-   Maintain full **observability**, **auditing**, and **governance** over model usage.

## Core concepts

### InferenceService (via KServe)

At the core of Model Serving is the **InferenceService** — a Kubernetes-native resource that represents a deployed model.

It defines the end-to-end serving pipeline:

-   **Predictor** — Runs the model server and handles inference.
-   **Transformer** (optional) — Applies pre-processing or post-processing.
-   **Explainer** (optional) — Provides model explainability outputs.

### Predictor

The Predictor defines:

-   **Model format** — PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, Triton, etc.
-   **Model location** — S3-compatible storage, OCI registry, PVC.
-   **Resources** — CPU, memory, GPU.
-   **Autoscaling** — Policies for elastic scaling, including scale-to-zero.

### ServingRuntime / ClusterServingRuntime

Reusable runtime definitions for serving:

-   **ServingRuntime** — Namespace-scoped.
-   **ClusterServingRuntime** — Cluster-wide reusable runtimes.

Benefits:

-   Tailor runtime settings to model type and hardware.
-   Standardize runtime configurations across teams and projects.

* * *

## How it works

### Lifecycle flow

1.  Register model image in **Model Library**.
2.  Deploy model via **Model Serving** console or CLI → creates InferenceService.
3.  AI Factory + KServe provision Kubernetes resources (pods, services).
4.  Model is loaded into runtime container.
5.  Kubernetes service endpoint is exposed.
6.  Clients send HTTP/gRPC inference requests.
7.  Requests may pass through Transformers and Explainers.
8.  Inference response is returned.

* * *

## Key features

-   **Multi-framework support** — PyTorch, TensorFlow, ONNX, XGBoost, Triton, and more.
-   **GPU acceleration** — Native NVIDIA GPU support.
-   **Autoscaling** — Including scale-to-zero via Knative.
-   **Observability** — Prometheus metrics, Kubernetes logging, and Hybrid Manager dashboards.
-   **Batching** — Server-side batching for improved throughput.
-   **Explainability** — Support for model explainability tooling.
-   **Security and Sovereign AI** — Models run on your Kubernetes clusters under your control.

## Patterns of use

### Gen AI Builder

-   Serve LLMs and multi-modal models powering **Assistants** and **Agents**.

### Knowledge Bases

-   Serve embedding and retrieval models used in:
-   **Knowledge Base indexing**
-   **RAG pipelines**

### Custom applications

-   Expose InferenceService endpoints to:
-   **Business applications**
-   **Microservices**
-   **ETL/ELT pipelines**

### Hybrid + Sovereign AI alignment

-   All models run **on your infrastructure** via Hybrid Manager KServe layer.
-   You control:
-   Which models are deployed
-   Resource allocations
-   Deployment topology
-   Observability and auditing

* * *

## Best practices

-   Always deploy models through the **Model Library → Model Serving** flow to ensure governance.
-   Monitor resource consumption — especially GPU utilization.
-   Test **scale-to-zero** policies carefully before production use.
-   Use **ServingRuntime** and **ClusterServingRuntime** templates for consistency.
-   Tag and document **production models** clearly in Model Library.
-   Audit InferenceService deployments regularly — critical for Sovereign AI.

## In AI Factory

Model Serving powers multiple components in EDB PG AI:

| Component           | How it uses Model Serving                                 |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Gen AI Builder**  | Runs LLMs and specialized models for Assistants           |
| **Knowledge Bases** | Serves embedding and retrieval models for RAG             |
| **Custom AI apps**  | Exposes InferenceService endpoints for business use cases |

AI Factory manages Model Serving through:

-   Integrated **Model Library** for image management.
-   **GPU resource management** and scheduling.
-   Centralized **observability** and logging.
-   Seamless Hybrid Manager integration for lifecycle control.
