The **Model Library** serves as the central governance system for AI model images within EDB Postgres AI, providing organizational control over model lifecycles while enabling integration across Pipelines, Model Serving, Knowledge Bases, and Gen AI Builder.

> **Prerequisites:** The Model Library requires [Hybrid Manager Asset Library](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/image-management/asset-library/) installation. All model metadata, versioning, and lifecycle operations are managed through the Asset Library infrastructure.

## Purpose and Function

Organizations implementing AI at scale face fundamental challenges with model management: fragmented repositories, version inconsistencies, compliance gaps, and limited operational visibility. The Model Library addresses these challenges through centralized governance that maintains control without sacrificing development velocity.

The system operates as a curated gateway between external model sources and internal AI capabilities, ensuring only validated models reach production environments while providing comprehensive audit trails for compliance requirements.

## Core Architecture

### Registry Integration Layer
The Model Library connects to external container registries through configurable synchronization rules. This layer automatically discovers, validates, and ingests model images based on organizational criteria while maintaining security boundaries.

**Supported Registry Types:**
- Harbor (private container registry)
- Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)
- Azure Container Registry (ACR)
- Google Container Registry (GCR)
- Custom registry implementations

### Governance Framework
Built-in approval workflows validate models against organizational policies before production availability. The framework supports complex multi-stakeholder approval processes while maintaining automated validation for standard compliance requirements.

**Policy Enforcement Points:**
- Security scanning and vulnerability assessment
- Performance benchmarking against organizational standards
- Compliance validation for regulatory requirements
- Digital signature verification for model provenance

### Distribution Hub
Approved models become available across all EDB PG AI capabilities through standardized interfaces. This ensures consistent model versions across development, staging, and production environments while supporting environment-specific configurations.

## Operational Workflows

### Model Registration Process

**Automated Discovery**
Repository rules define which external sources to monitor for new model versions. The system continuously scans configured registries and automatically ingests models matching defined criteria, reducing manual overhead while ensuring policy compliance.

**Validation Pipeline**
Newly ingested models undergo automated validation including security scanning, metadata extraction, and performance verification. Models failing validation checks are quarantined until issues are resolved or explicitly approved through override procedures.

**Approval Routing**
Validated models enter approval workflows based on classification and risk assessment. The system routes models to appropriate stakeholders while providing automated approval for models meeting predefined criteria.

### Lifecycle Management

**Version Control**
The system maintains immutable version history for all registered models, supporting semantic versioning schemes and backward compatibility validation. Version tracking enables rollback capabilities and dependency management across complex model ecosystems.

**Promotion Pipelines**
Models advance through environment tiers (development → staging → production) based on validation checkpoints and approval gates. Automated promotion reduces deployment friction while maintaining quality control.

**Deprecation Handling**
Configurable retention policies manage model lifecycle transitions, providing advance notification before deprecation and ensuring safe retirement without disrupting active deployments.

## Integration Points

### Model Serving Platform
The Model Library provides the curated catalog for [Model Serving](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/model/serving/) deployments. Only models approved through the governance framework can be deployed to production inference endpoints, ensuring consistent security and compliance standards.

**Integration Benefits:**
- Automated model updates with validation checkpoints
- Rollback capabilities for problematic deployments
- Performance metadata optimization for resource allocation
- Seamless KServe infrastructure integration

### AI Accelerator Pipelines
Pipeline execution leverages validated models from the library, ensuring consistency across [AI Accelerator Pipelines](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/pipeline/) stages and environments. The system provides performance characteristics that optimize pipeline resource allocation and execution strategies.

### Gen AI Builder
[Gen AI Builder](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/gen-ai) applications access governed model collections through the library interface. This ensures knowledge base implementations use validated embedding models and assistant creation references approved language models.

## Security and Access Control

### Multi-Tenant Architecture
Role-based access control aligns with organizational hierarchies while providing namespace isolation for different teams and projects. Fine-grained permissions control model registration, approval, and deployment activities based on user roles and organizational policies.

### Security Validation
Automated vulnerability scanning examines all registered model images for known security issues. The system validates model signatures and provenance information during registration while implementing policy-based controls that prevent risky deployments.

**Security Features:**
- Digital signature verification for model authenticity
- Vulnerability database integration for threat detection
- Policy engine for automated security control enforcement
- Comprehensive audit logging for security monitoring

## Implementation Considerations

### Registry Configuration
Establishing registry connections requires careful consideration of network topology, authentication mechanisms, and synchronization frequency. Organizations must balance automation benefits with security requirements when configuring repository rules.

**Critical Factors:**
- Network connectivity and firewall requirements
- Authentication and authorization mechanisms
- Synchronization frequency and resource impact
- Error handling and retry strategies
