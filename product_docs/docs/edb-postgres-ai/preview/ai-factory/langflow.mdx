description: Facilitate building AI pipelines with Langflow
---


Langflow is an open-source tool to build and deploy AI pipelines and MCP servers.
It supports important AI functionality like agents and the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and it doesn't require the use of specific large language models (LLMs) or vector stores.


### EDB components in Langflow
You can build an AI pipeline by using the components available in the EDB folder in Langflow.
To use the EDB components, make sure the required preconfigurations are met before using them in Langflow.


#### Requirements
Users need the required the necessary permissions in HM to create AI pipelines with Langflow.
[What permissions are needed?]: #

1. Access Langflow via Launchpad in HM.

1. Create an access key by creating a machine user or via a My Account.

1. Make sure you have the required access.
   [What type of access is needed?]: #

1. Save the access key and other variables in Langflow as [Global Variables](https://docs.langflow.org/configuration-global-variables#create-a-global-variable).


### EDB Knowledge Base component

#### Requirements
1. Create a cluster from a project.

1. After creating your access key, request access to the cluster and make sure the access key has the project-level role.

1. Create a [Knowledge Base via aidb](/edb-postgres-ai/preview/ai-factory/pipeline/knowledge_base/usage/#knowledge-base-for-a-table-data-source) in the cluster.

```
CREATE EXTENSION aidb CASCADE;

CREATE TABLE public.test_source_table_gt_prj1
(
    id               INT GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    content          TEXT NOT NULL,
    unrelated_column TEXT
);

INSERT INTO public.test_source_table_gt_prj1
VALUES (43941, 'Catwalk Women Brown Heels'),
       (55018, 'Lakme 3 in 1 Orchid  Aqua Shine Lip Color'),
       (19337, 'United Colors of Benetton Men Stripes Black Jacket');

SELECT aidb.create_table_knowledge_base(
    name => 'psr_261_knowledge_base',
    model_name => 'bert',  -- this is a pre-defined locally running model
    source_table => 'public.test_source_table_gt_prj1',
    source_data_column => 'content',
    source_data_format => 'Text'
);

SELECT aidb.bulk_embedding('psr_261_knowledge_base');

--- below for Testing
select count(*) from public.test_source_table_gt_prj1;

SELECT * FROM aidb.kbs; 

SELECT * FROM aidb.kbstat; 

SELECT * FROM aidb.retrieve_key('psr_261_knowledge_base', 'orchid');
SELECT * FROM aidb.retrieve_text('psr_261_knowledge_base', 'orchid');
```

### EDB Knowledge Base in Langflow
1. Move the EDB Knowledge Base component per drag and drop to a the flow.

1. In the field **HM Machine User Key**, enter the access key you have created.

1. Under **Hybrid Manager Project**, select your project from the dropdown menu.

1. Under **Hybrid Manager Database**, select the cluster that contains the EDB Knowledge Base.

1. Under **Database Connection Type**, select the connection type from the dropdown menu.

1. Under **User for the database**, select the user from the dropdown menu.
   [Is the database user always "edb_admin"?]: #

1. Under **Password for database**, select **DB_PW**.
   [Is the password parameter always "DB_PW"?]: #

1. Under **Database Name**, select the database you created the Knowledge Base in.

1. Under **Query Value**, enter a keyword of your choice.

1. Select Play (play icon) on the upper right next to **EDB Knowledge Base**

1. Select **Result Table** (icon) in the lower-right corner to verify the component output.

!!! Tip Tip
By toggling **Include Text** before running the component, the component will include the text results.
!!! 

## EDB Database 


#### Preconfiguration
1. Create a cluster from a project.

1. Make sure you have the required access as AI Model Manager to the cluster.

1. Enter the required data if you want to test the scenario below.
   [What data is to be inserted?]: #

### EDB Database in Langflow
1. Move the EDB Database component per drag and drop to Langflow.

1. In the field **HM Machine User Key**, enter the Access key you have created.

1. Under **Hybrid Manager Project**, select your project from the dropdown menu.

1. Under **Hybrid Manager Database**, select the cluster that contains the EDB Knowledge Base.

1. Under **Database Connection Type**, select the connection type from the dropdown menu.

1. Under **User for the database**, select the database user from the dropdown menu.
   [Is the database user always "edb_admin"?]: #

1. Under **Password for database**, select **DB_PW**.
   [Is the password parameter always "DB_PW"?]: #

1. Under **Database Name**, select the database you created the Knowledge Base in.

1. Select the play icon on the upper right next to **EDB Knowledge Base**

1. Select **Result Table** (icon) in the lower-right corner to verify the component output.


### MCP Server in Langflow

Langflow supports the Airman MCP server for the EDB Database component.


#### Requirements
1. Follow the same steps to [set up the EDB DB Component](/edb-postgres-ai/preview/ai-factory/langflow/#edb-database-component).

1. In Langflow, select to your profile icon in the upper-right corner.

1. Select **Settings** from the dropdown menu.

1. Select **Langflow API Key** from the left navigation pane.

1. Select **Add New** and enter a description in the field **Description**.

1. Select **Generate API Key**.

<br/>
#### Add the MCP Server to the flow

[Ask if MCP Server feature has been tested]: #

1. In your new flow, select the MCP icon from the left navigation pane.

1. Drag and drop your MCP server to the flow.

1. Under **Tool**, select the action you want to run.

1. Select the **Global Variable** you have created.

1. Select the Response icon in the lower-right corner of **MCP Tools**.

1. Run the MCP server in **Tool mode** to improve the functionality of the actions.

      [Ask for clarification on this]: #

    - If you add an AI agent, the AI agent can use tools.

    - If you add the options **Chat Input** and **Chat Output** to the agent and select **Playground**, you can ask the AI agent to use the tool.


### EDB Embeddings component
The EDB Embeddings component is a model-related component that requires the creation of model clusters.


#### Requirements

You have to create a model cluster to use the EDB Embeddings component.

!!!note Note 
Make sure a [GPU node is deployed](/edb-postgres-ai/latest/ai-factory/model/setup-gpu/) before creating a new model cluster.
!!!

### Creating a model cluster

1. In the **Asset Library**, select **Models**

1. Select **Add New Model** on the right hand side of your screen.

1. Enter the required parameters in the fields.

1. In the **Models** section, select the model cluster you have created.

1. In the upper-right hand, select **Create Cluster With This Model**.

1. Enter a name for the model cluster.

1. In the **Asset Library**, select the model cluster you have created.

1. Under **Clusters Using This Model**, check **Status** to verify that the cluster is active.
