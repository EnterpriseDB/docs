**EDB Postgres® AI** provides a scalable, modular platform to build and operationalize AI-powered applications and intelligent data products — starting from **your data**, in **your databases**, running in **your data center or cloud environments**.
**EDB PG AI is designed for Hybrid Manager™ first.** Most capabilities are delivered and managed inside [Hybrid Manager’s AI Factory](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/ai-factory/), where you get a unified control plane, governance, and observability. You can also run selected components outside Hybrid Manager — notably Postgres extensions and AI DB (AIDB) — when supported by licensing.

At its core, EDB Postgres® AI (EDB PG AI) is designed to enable **Sovereign AI**: allowing you to build intelligence on top of your trusted Postgres data, governed within your enterprise boundaries. Your models, your pipelines, your vector indexes — all managed and controlled by you.

With EDB PG AI, you can:

-   Build and run [**Gen AI agents**](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/gen-ai) and conversational experiences powered by your enterprise knowledge and sovereign Postgres data in [**Hybrid Manager**](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/ai-factory/)
-   Perform [**vector search**](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/vector-engine) and **retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)** over structured and unstructured sources
-   Create [**document intelligence pipelines**](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/pipeline) that ingest, process, and classify data from diverse sources
-   Deploy scalable [**model serving**](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/model/serving/), using GPU acceleration and enterprise observability
-   Extend Postgres with AI-driven query patterns and [**vector-native capabilities**](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/vector-engine)
-   Seamlessly combine AI and analytics across Postgres, EDB Lakehouse, and other EDB-integrated platforms

## Where AI Factory runs

Choose the right operating model for your teams and environments:

- Hybrid Manager (recommended hub): Use [AI Factory in Hybrid Manager](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/ai-factory/) to provision, govern, and observe AI workloads across Postgres, pipelines, vector search, model serving, and Gen AI.
- Outside Hybrid Manager (selected components): Run Postgres-focused capabilities on compatible platforms, such as the [Vector Engine](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/vector-engine), [Pipelines](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/pipeline), or the AI DB (AIDB) feature set where available.

When you operate outside Hybrid Manager, you own cluster lifecycle, security, and observability. Validate compatibility, performance, and licensing for your target platform before deployment.

---

## Prerequisites

What you need depends on where you run:

- Using Hybrid Manager: Access to a Hybrid Manager instance with AI Factory enabled and the entitlements required for Gen AI, model serving, and vector search. See [AI Factory in Hybrid Manager](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/ai-factory/).
- Running components outside Hybrid Manager: A supported Postgres environment for extensions and AIDB, and the necessary infrastructure for pipelines and model serving as applicable.

For precise component support (outside Hybrid Manager), minimum versions, and licensing boundaries, coordinate with your EDB representative and your platform owner.

## Why Sovereign AI?

EDB PG AI enables you to create **Sovereign AI solutions** that respect your data ownership, security, and governance requirements:

-   Operate on **your data** — in your Postgres databases and EDB analytics lakes
-   Train and serve **your models**, under your control — no opaque third-party APIs required
-   Deploy **where you need** — in Hybrid Manager, on-prem data centers, or in your cloud tenancy
-   Integrate AI, analytics, and operational data into unified, governed architectures
-   Audit, monitor, and control the full lifecycle of AI workloads — from ingestion to inference

By combining Postgres, modern AI pipelines, and scalable model serving in a fully governed architecture, EDB PG AI helps you unlock AI innovation **without compromising trust or compliance**.

* * *

## What You Can Build

EDB PG AI is designed to help you create intelligent applications and systems **on top of your trusted data** — with Postgres at the center.

You can build:

-   **Enterprise knowledge assistants** powered by Gen AI and Postgres-native [**vector search**](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/vector-engine)
-   **AI-powered search portals** that integrate structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data
-   **Document processing pipelines** with [**Pipelines**](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/pipeline), OCR, summarization, classification, and extraction
-   **Conversational applications** for both internal users and external customers, built with [**Gen AI Builder**](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/gen-ai/knowledge-bases)
-   **AI-powered data apps** exposing [**model-serving APIs**](/edb-postgres-ai/current/ai-factory/model/serving/) for search, recommendations, NLP, and vision
-   **Intelligent automation** embedded in business systems and workflows — driven by your data
-   **RAG architectures** combining Postgres, Lakehouse, and Gen AI to deliver trusted answers
