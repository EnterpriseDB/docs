Hybrid Manager (HM) has two types of users: human users (native users or IDP users) and machine users.

You can assign any of the default roles to both types of users, except that only machine users can be estate ingesters.

The two main categories of roles are organization-level and project-level.

## Organization-level roles

You can assign these roles to human or machine users using the **User Management** option of your user profile menu at the top-right of the navigation bar in the HM console.

### Organization Administrator

This role provides read access at the organization level, allowing the user to view information and settings in the organization as a whole.

### Organization Owner

The purpose of this role is to manage the organization at a high level.
Organization owners can create projects and assign organization-level roles to other users.

### Platform Administrator

This role is for users who need to access and manage the underlying platform components of HM.
They can access platform management and monitoring tools.

### AI Model Manager

This role is for users who work with the AI model and model service feature of HM, granting them full access to its functions.

## Project-level roles

These roles can be assigned to human or machine users (except for estate ingester). Select **Users** in the left navigation when viewing a project.

### Project Owner

In a specific project, the project owner has the highest level of authority.

### Project Editor
