## Monitoring user

When configuring the agent, you must first connect to the self-managed database you want to monitor and create a user that the agent will use to connect to the database. This user can be any Postgres user with the pg_monitor role assigned.

For this example, create a user `agent_user`:

```sql
CREATE USER agent_user WITH PASSWORD '<password>';
GRANT pg_monitor TO agent_user;
```

If you're using Postgres 16 or earlier, you must also grant the following permission to allow the agent to discover the Postgres log file location:

```sql
GRANT EXECUTE ON FUNCTION pg_catalog.pg_current_logfile() TO agent_user;
```

You must ensure that the agent user can log in to the database to which you plan to connect.
For example, if you plan to connect to a database called `hr`:

```sql
GRANT CONNECT ON DATABASE hr TO USER agent_user;
```

## The edb_internals schema and required extensions

To leverage the full monitoring and optimization features of Hybrid Manager (HM), you must enable extensions that add instrumentation to Postgres. You need these extensions to enable the **Query Diagnostics** and **Recommendations** tabs as well as some metrics.

To install the extensions: 

1.  Refer to the per-extension installation instructions for the correct commands for your platform and Postgres distribution:

    -   [EDB Wait States](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pg_extensions/wait_states/installing/)

    -   [EDB Query Advisor](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pg_extensions/query_advisor/installing/)

    -   [EDB Stat Monitor](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pg_extensions/edb_stat_monitor/installing/)

    In addition, [pg_stat_statements](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgstatstatements.html) must be enabled in the public schema.
    pg_stat_statements is installed with Postgres, so no additional installation is required.

    For example, on RHEL 9, to monitor EDB Advanced Server 17:

    ```shell
    dnf install edb-as17-server-edb_wait_states \
                edb-as17-query-advisor \
                edb-as17-stat_monitor
    ```

1.  While connected to the database, add the required preload modules to the Postgres `shared_preload_libraries`. For example, if the current value of `shared_preload_libraries` is empty:

    ```sql
    ALTER SYSTEM SET 
    shared_preload_libraries="$libdir/pg_stat_statements","$libdir/edb_wait_states", "$libdir/query_advisor","$libdir/edb_stat_monitor";
    ```

1.  As a superuser, create the schema in the database to which the agent will be connected and enable the `pg_stat_statements` extension as well as the extensions installed in the previous step:

    ```sql
    CREATE SCHEMA edb_internals;
    CREATE EXTENSION edb_wait_states WITH SCHEMA edb_internals;
    CREATE EXTENSION query_advisor WITH SCHEMA edb_internals;
    CREATE EXTENSION edb_stat_monitor WITH SCHEMA edb_internals;
    CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements;
    ```

1.  Add the edb_internals schema to the search path. For example, as a superuser:

    ```sql
    ALTER SYSTEM SET 
    search_path="$user", public, edb_internals;
    ```

1.  Grant the agent user access to this schema:
    ```sql
    GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA edb_internals TO agent_user;
    GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA edb_internals TO agent_user;
    GRANT EXECUTE ON ALL FUNCTIONS IN SCHEMA edb_internals TO agent_user;
    ```

## Postgres logging configuration

To collect Postgres logs, the Postgres logging collector must be enabled and the agent must have permission to read the log files.
The simplest way to do this is to run the agent as the Postgres user. 
However, as a matter of security best practice, we recommend running the agent using a [dedicated OS user](agent_os_user/).

To allow the agent OS user to read the log files, logs must be located outside of the data directory and have appropriate permissions. 
For example, setting the following parameters in `postgresql.conf` causes logs to be written to `/var/log/postgres-lc` and be readable by any user who's a member of the owner's group:

```ini
logging_collector=on
log_directory='/var/log/postgres-lc'
log_file_mode=0640
log_destination = 'jsonlog'
```

!!! Note Logs must be JSON

    Logs ingested by the agent must be formatted as JSON.
    This option is supported in Postgres 15 and later.

The new logging location must be owned by the Postgres user and readable by that user's group. Since the agent OS user is a member of the same group, it then also gets access to the log directory. For example:

```shell
mkdir /var/log/postgres-lc
chown postgres:postgres /var/log/postgres-lc
chmod 0750 /var/log/postgres-lc
```

Restart Postgres after completing these changes.
