description: Learn how to run the agent as a service when setting up monitoring with Hybrid Manager.
---

For continuous metric streaming and to ensure your database remains visible in your Hybrid Manager (HM) estate, configure the agent to run as a service. Running as a service allows it to start automatically on system startup and restart after any errors.

If you don't set up the agent as a service, it streams metrics only when you manually run it. Furthermore, your database will disappear from your HM estate 72 hours after the agent stops streaming. 

Finish installing and configuring the agent before setting it up as a service.

!!!note

    Future versions of the agent package may set this up automatically.

This example configures the agent to run on an RHEL 9 machine. However, we provide operating system aids so you know when to replace the values.

!!! Note "Environment variables"
You must ensure that any environment variables referenced in the agent configuration file are accessible to the service at runtime.

1.  Create a file using your text editor of choice. This example command uses the vi editor:

    ```
    sudo vi /usr/lib/systemd/system/beacon-agent.service
    ```

    Other default system directories on AWS EC2 instances are: 

    | Operating system | Default system directory                     |
    | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
    | RHEL             | /usr/lib/systemd/system/beacon-agent.service |
    | Rocky Linux      | /usr/lib/systemd/system/beacon-agent.service |
    | AlmaLinux        | /usr/lib/systemd/system/beacon-agent.service |
    | Ubuntu           | /etc/systemd/system/beacon-agent.service     |
    | Debian           | /lib/systemd/system/beacon-agent.service     |

1.  Paste the following template into the `beacon-agent.service` file and replace the information in placeholders `< >`.

    ```
    # TEMPLATE 

    [Unit]
    Description=Agent

    After=network.target

    [Service]
    Type=simple

    User=<user>

    WorkingDirectory=</home/user/>

    ExecStart=</usr/local/bin/beacon-agent>

    Restart=on-failure
    RestartSec=60

    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

    | Service settings    | Placeholder to replace          | Guidelines                                                                                                        |
    | ------------------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | `User=`             | `<user>`                        | Provide the name of the system user that will run the agent.                                              |
    | `WorkingDirectory=` | `</home/user/>`                 | Set the working directory to where you stored the `.beacon` directory. The path depends on the operating system.  |
    | `ExecStart=`        | `</usr/local/bin/beacon-agent>` | Provide the path to the directory where the agent was installed. The path depends on the operating system. |

1.  Run the following commands to reload, enable, and start your new service. These commands apply to all mentioned operating systems:

    ```
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable beacon-agent.service
    sudo systemctl start beacon-agent.service
    ```

1.  Your agent is now running as a service. Check the logs:

    ```
    journalctl -u beacon-agent.service
    ```
