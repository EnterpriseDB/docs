We recommend that you create a dedicated operating system user to configure and run the agent.
This is a security best practice because it avoids granting permissions to the agent that it doesn't need to function.

!!! Note Testing and development

    Running the agent as either the root user or the Postgres user can be convenient for testing and development because both these users have all the permissions the agent needs.
    However, the root user has full access to your operating system, and the Postgres user has full access to all your Postgres data as well as superuser access to Postgres.
    We therefore recommend that you don't run as either of these users in long-lived or production environments.

To create a user:

```shell
sudo useradd <agent_os_user>
```

We recommend that you add the agent OS user to the Postgres user's group.
This facilitates granting the agent access to the Postgres log files later.

```shell
sudo usermod -aG postgres <agent_os_user>
```
