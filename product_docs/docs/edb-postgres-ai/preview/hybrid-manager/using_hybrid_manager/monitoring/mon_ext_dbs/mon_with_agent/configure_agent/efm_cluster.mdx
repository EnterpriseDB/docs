To monitor an EDB Failover Manager, deploy one agent per efm node (excluding the witness node).

## Configuring clusters and nodes with manager type as `efm`

- Set manager type as `efm`

- Use the `cluster_name` field to specify the name of the Failover Manager cluster. The cluster name is the prefix of the name of the cluster properties file. For example, if your cluster properties file is named efm.properties, your cluster name is efm.

```yaml
clusters:
  - resource_id: selfmanaged_efm_postgres_1
    name: "<instance_name1>"
    manager: "efm"
    efm:
      cluster_name: "<efm_cluster_name>"
    nodes:
      - resource_id: <efm_node_resource_id_1>
        dsn: "$DSN1.1"
        ...
```

Since we need to deploy one agent per efm node, the nodes list will contain only one entry.

!!! Note

    Beacon agent leverages the `efm` cli and run the `efm cluster-status-json <cluster_name>` command to collect the monitoring info of the failover manager.
