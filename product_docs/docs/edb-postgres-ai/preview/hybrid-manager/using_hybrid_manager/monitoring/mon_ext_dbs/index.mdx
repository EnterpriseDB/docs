## On HM-managed database clusters

Since [Hybrid Manager (HM)-managed database clusters](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/hm_terminology/#hm-managed-clusters) are created in the same environment as HM, their resources are already accessible. Therefore, these clusters are monitored by default, and monitoring starts as soon as their deployment is finished.

## On external database clusters

[External database clusters](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/hm_terminology/#external-clusters) are either managed by a cloud service provider (CSP) or by you. For this reason, additional steps are required to create a connection between your database cluster and your HM instance.

There are two types of external databases that you can monitor:

-   **Monitoring self-managed deployments** 

    To [enable monitoring on self-managed deployments](mon_with_agent), you must install the agent and register external self-managed databases.

    **Examples:** Self-managed Postgres databases or Cluster managers like EDB Failover Manager you have on bare metal, or those hosted in the cloud that aren't managed by the CSP (like a Postgres database on an EC2 instance).


-   **Monitoring CSP-managed databases**

    To [enable monitoring on CSP-managed databases](mon_ext_csp), connect the database to HM.

    **Examples:** Amazon RDS.

   You can also register databases with the agent to [assess them for migration](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migration_guides/oracle_to_hm_managed/).
