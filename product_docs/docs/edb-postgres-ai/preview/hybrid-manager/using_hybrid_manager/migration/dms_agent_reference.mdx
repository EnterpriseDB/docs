## DMS agent general configuration

These parameters define the information the EDB DMS agent requires to:

- Access the Hybrid Manager (HM) instance and project that you're using for the migration
- Connect to the source database and collect data or connect to the destination database and migrate data

!!!note
    A DMS Agent instance can only run in either reader or writer mode.

### DBCONFIG_ID

The name you assign to identify a source/destination. This name will later appear either as a source in the **Migrate** section in the **Sources** tab of the HM console or as a destination in the **Destinations** tab.

For the ID:

-   The maximum character length is 255 characters.
-   You can use lowercase and uppercase characters, numbers, underscores(\_) and hyphens(-). Other special characters aren't supported.
-   The ID must be unique in a project. Don't use the same ID for two or more sources/destinations in the same project.

### RUN_MODE

Determines how the EDB DMS agent runs. Set it to `reader` if you're using the DMS agent to connect HM with a migration source. Set it to `writer` if you're connecting HM with an external, self-managed migration destination.

Run the DMS agent in writer mode only if the destination for your migration is a self-managed Postgres database.

### RW_SERVICE_HOST

Specifies the URL of the DMS that the EDB DMS agent uses to perform migrations. Because the `RW_SERVICE_HOST` leverages the DMS (transporter) service for migrations, you can derive it from `DMS_DOMAIN_NAME`, a domain name established by HM administrators or installers for migration component communication.

To obtain your `RW_SERVICE_HOST`:

1.  In the HM console, select the project you want to use for migrations.

1.  In the left navigation select **Migrate** and then select **Sources** or **Destinations**. 
    
    Both **Sources** and **Destinations** pages display the `RW_SERVICE_HOST` in a banner at the top of the page. 
    
1.  Use the copy icon to get the value and use it for the configuration of your EDB DMS agent.

### CREDENTIAL_DIRECTORY_PATH

The directory path of the credentials folder you [downloaded from the HM console](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migration_guides/self_managed_pg_to_self_managed_pg/creating_project_credentials/).

## DMS agent database configuration

These parameters (`DBCONFIG_DATABASES` section) define a list of source/destination database information the EDB DMS agent requires to connect to the correct database for the migration.

You can configure the EDB DMS agent to migrate multiple databases. The `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__TYPE` section delimits the information for the first database. You can use `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_1__TYPE` to provide data for a second database. Add more sections to the EDB DMS agent (`DBCONFIG_DATABASES_2__TYPE`, `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_3__TYPE`) by increasing the index manually.

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__TYPE

The source/destination database type. 

The EDB DMS agent supports `ORACLE` and `POSTGRES` as source database types (in reader mode), but only `POSTGRES` as a destination type (in writer mode).

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__HOSTNAME

The hostname of the source/destination database.

!!!note

    For RDS databases, ensure the `DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__HOSTNAME` value points to the RDS endpoint you can find under **Connectivity & security** in the AWS console. A redacted example is `foo_database.cb7asw1xxxxx.eu-west-0.rds.amazonaws.com`.


### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__PORT

The port of the source/destination database.

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__CATALOG

The database name in the source/destination database server.

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__USERNAME

The database username of the source/destination database.

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__PASSWORD

The password for the database username of the source/destination database. You can set an environment variable for the password without specifying it in the script, but the variable must follow this format: `export DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__PASSWORD=password`

### DBCONFIG_DATABASES_0__RESOURCEID

User-defined identifier for resource management. If you previously registered this database with the HM agent for monitoring and schema ingestion, use the same `resource_id` here. This consistency is essential for the DMS to correctly correlate the resource across both the HM agent and DMS agent components.

### FIPS_MODE

If you need to comply with FIPS standards, enable FIPS mode for the DMS Agent by setting the environment variable to true: `export FIPS_MODE=true`.

### QUARKUS_LOG_LEVEL

Sets the default log level for the entire Quarkus application, including all underlying frameworks and third-party libraries.

Avoid setting this to `DEBUG` or `TRACE` unless you need to diagnose issues within the entire application ecosystem. Using this method produces logs that are excessively verbose and difficult to analyze. Use `QUARKUS_LOG_CATEGORY__COM_ENTERPRISEDB__LEVEL` instead for focused debugging.

### QUARKUS_LOG_CATEGORY__COM_ENTERPRISEDB__LEVEL

Sets the log level specifically for classes within the `com.enterprisedb` package.

This is the recommended parameter for debugging. Set this parameter to `DEBUG` or `TRACE` to obtain detailed logging for the DMS agent's core logic (the components relevant to schema extraction, migration assessment, etc.). This isolates the useful output and excludes messages from third-party libraries.
