Hybrid Manager (HM) provides an integrated solution to perform migrations from external databases into your environment. This capability allows you to bring your existing data, schemas, and applications into a centralized management hub, facilitating easier administration and monitoring.

For data migration, the migration process primarily leverages the EDB Data Migration Service (DMS). It works with other integrations like the Migration Portal and AI Copilot to offer a comprehensive workflow for assessing, converting, and migrating your databases.

## How do I use migration capabilities in HM? 

You perform the migration process using a series of steps that connect your source database and your destination database to the HM console.
To understand the workflow, see [Migration architecture](architecture).

## What kind of migrations does the EDB Data Migration Service support?

The EDB DMS supports migrations from external databases into HM-managed databases, from external databases to other external databases, from HM-managed databases to external databases, and more. To see end-to-end examples of possible migration paths, see [Choosing your migration path](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migration_guides/).

For supported source and destination databases, see the [support matrix](supported_versions). 

For supported migration methods, see [Migration types](terminology/#migration-types).

## What kind of technologies does the EDB Data Migration Service use?

DMS is built on Apache Kafka and the open-source Debezium CDC platform. Using change data capture (CDC) and event streaming, source database row changes are replicated to the migration destination.
