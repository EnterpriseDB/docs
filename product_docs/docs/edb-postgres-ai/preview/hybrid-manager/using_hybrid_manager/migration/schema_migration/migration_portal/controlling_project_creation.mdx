If you registered an Oracle database with Hybrid Manager (HM) via the HM agent, a Migration Portal project is **created automatically** for all the database schemas and dependencies. 

It creates a project per registered database (per `resource_id` established in the `beacon-agent.yaml`) as long as the schema size per database doesn't exceed the default maximum size of 300 MB. 

!!!note
Take into account that any schemas added post-registration aren't reflected in the Migration Portal project.

## Customizing the maximum size of Migration Portal projects

The default maximum size of Migration Portal projects is 300 MB. If the schema ingested is larger than that, the Migration Portal will require you to [create Migration Portal projects manually](hm_schema_migration/#creating-a-migration-portal-project-manually). However, there are scenarios where setting a different maximum size for automatically created projects is preferred, for example, for:

- Project size control
- Cost and resource management
- Workflow control

To alter the maximum size of Migration Portal projects created automatically, you must edit the `beacon_server` ConfigMap in your HM Kubernetes cluster and restart the server deployment. The `beacon_server` is the service that controls Migration Portal project configurations.

1.  Edit the ConfigMap:

    ```shell
    kubectl edit configmap beacon-server-config -n upm-beacon
    ```

1.  Locate the `beacon_server.yaml` block and insert or modify the `max_automatic_project_creation_bytes` section under `server`:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      beacon_server.yaml: |
      # [...]
        server:
        # [...]
          migration_portal_configuration:
            max_automatic_project_creation_bytes: 150000000
    ```

    !!!note
    The value set for `max_automatic_project_creation_bytes` must be equal or less than the value configured for `schema_max_file_size` (which by default is also 300 MB), for example: 

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    data:
      beacon_server.yaml: |
      # [...]
        server:
        # [...]
          stream_configuration:
            schema_max_file_size: 150000000
          migration_portal_configuration:
            max_automatic_project_creation_bytes: 150000000
    ```

    !!!

1.  Apply the changes by restarting the `beacon_server` deployment:

    ```shell
    kubectl rollout restart deployment upm-beacon-server -n upm-beacon
    ```

    !!!warning
    The `upm-beacon-server` supports all database registration and schema ingestion activities across the entire HM instance using HM agents. Restarting the `upm-beacon-server` will halt all _ongoing_ database registrations and schema ingestions, regardless of the project. Ensure you coordinate this restart with other users.
    
    Databases that already appear in the **Estate > Migrations** tab, for which schema ingestions have finished, are not affected by restarts.
    !!!

1.  You can monitor the status of your restarted service: 

    ```shell
    kubectl get pods -n upm-beacon
    ```

## Disabling the automatic creation of Migration Portal projects

While automatic project creation is convenient for getting started quickly, there are scenarios where manual management is preferred, for example, for: 

- Cost and resource management
- Staging and development environments 
- Workflow control and auditoring

To disable automatic Migration Portal project creation, you currently have to apply a workaround where you configure the maximum size of the automatic project creation to such a low number that HM fails and you are prompted to create projects manually. See [Known Issues](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/limitations/#disabling-the-automatic-migration-portal-project-creation-requires-a-workaround) for more information.
