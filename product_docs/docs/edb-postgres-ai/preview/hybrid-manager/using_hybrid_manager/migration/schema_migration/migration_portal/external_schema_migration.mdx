Use the [user's workspace](access_mp.mdx#project-scoped-workspace-vs-users-workspace) of Migration Portal to assess, convert, and migrate externally provided DDL files for Oracle database migrations.

To access the project-scoped workspace of Migration Portal in the scope of Hybrid Manager (HM) migrations that leverage the HM agent, [access Migration Portal from the detailed view of the Oracle databases](hm_schema_migration.mdx).

## Prerequisites

-   **Optional:** To facilitate resolving schema incompatibilities in Migration Portal, the HM administrator must [enable and configure the AI Copilot with the AI/LLM of your organization](../../../enabling_migration_copilot.mdx).

## Accessing Migration Portal

Use the Launchpad to access Migration Portal.

1.  [Access the Launchpad](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/hm_overview/using-portal/#launchpad).

1.  To open the Migration Portal tab, hover over the **Migration Portal** tile and select **View Service**. 

## Next steps

Use Migration Portal to: 

-   Resolve any incompatibilities and complete the schema conversion. 

-   [Perform an online or offline migration](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_portal/latest/04_mp_migrating_database/03_mp_schema_migration/) of the converted schemas to a destination database.

See the [Migration Portal documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_portal/latest/03_mp_using_portal/) for recommendations and guidelines on how to use it.
