description: Verify the Oracle database has been assessed for migration by the Hybrid Manager through the HM Agent.

To verify the Oracle database has been recognized by the HM Agent and is available for assessment, go to your HM console, select **Estate** > **Migrations**.

If the database appears in the table, you now have access to the following resources: 

-   A migration assessment, which provides a summarized view of database schema count, core count, migration complexity, and level of effort. It is available on the [**Migrations** tab](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migrate/migrations/) of the **Estate** page. 

-   A migration database [detailed view](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migrations/migration_database_details_view/), which provides an expanded analysis of **Schemas**, a global and more detailed **Assessment**, as well as a **Migrations** hub that provides direct connections to other tools in the console that will help you perform migrations. These resources are available when you select a specific Oracle database from the **Estate** page > **Migrations** tab.

-   Automatic schema DDL extraction that you can leverage to perform schema migrations with the built-in Migration Portal. Automatic Migration Portal project creation that you can use to convert any incompatible schemas and migrate them to the destination database.
