This section collects all the steps you need to perform a migration from a **self-managed Postgres database** to an **HM-managed database cluster**.

## Prepare your source database

Prepare your source database for data migration. This involves creating a dedicated user for the migration, and altering the database configuration to enable necessary replication features.

1.  [Prepare the source Postgres database](preparing_source_pg_db).

## Assess the database (optional)

Install and configure the HM agent with your database to obtain observability and monitoring data for your Postgres database. This optional step also provides high-level migration metrics like schema count and names, table count, and object count.

1.  [Configure the HM agent to assess your database](agent_postgres.mdx).

## Create a destination database

Create a cluster in the HM instance to host the destination database.

1.  [Create a destination database in HM](creating_destination_db).

## Migrate your schema

Handle incompatibilities and transfer your schemas.

1.  [Handle constraints for schema migration](handling_schema). 

1.  [Migrate schemas](migrating_schema). 

## Migrate your data

Execute the data transfer and complete the final cleanup steps.

1.  [Create project credentials for the data migration](creating_project_credentials). 

1.  [Configure the DMS Agent in reader mode for a data migration](configuring_reader). 

1.  [Verify your source database appears in the HM Console](viewing_source).

1.  [Create and performing the data migration](creating_migration).

1.  [Monitor your data migration](monitoring_migration).

1.  [Finalize the migration](finalizing_migration) (for streaming migrations only).

1.  [Apply excluded constraints](applying_constraints).
