This section collects all the steps you need to perform a migration from a **self-managed Postgres database** to a different **self-managed Postgres database** using the Data Migration Service of the Hybrid Manager.

## Prepare your source database

Prepare your source database for data migration. This involves creating a dedicated user for the migration, and altering the database configuration to enable necessary replication features.

1.  [Prepare the source Postgres database](preparing_source_pg_db).

## Assess the database (optional)

Install and configure the HM agent with your database to obtain observability and monitoring data for your Postgres database. This optional step also provides high-level migration metrics like schema count and names, table count, and object count.

1.  [Configure the HM agent to assess your database](agent_postgres.mdx).

## Prepare your destination database

Create a server to host the destination database. Then, alter the destination database's configuration to to enable necessary replication features.

1.  [Create a destination database in your server](creating_destination_db).

1.  [Prepare the destination Postgres database](preparing_destination_selfpg_db).

## Migrate your schema

Handle incompatibilities and transfer your schemas.

1.  [Handling constraints for schema migration](handling_schema). 

1.  [Migrating schemas](migrating_schema). 

## Migrate your data

Execute the data transfer and complete the final cleanup steps.

1.  [Create project credentials for the data migration](creating_project_credentials). 

1.  [Configuring a DMS Agent in reader mode for a data migration](configuring_reader). 

1.  [Verifying your source database appears in the HM Console](viewing_source).

1.  [Configuring a DMS Agent in writer mode for a data migration to a self-managed Postgres database](configuring_writer).

1.  [Verifying your destination appears in the HM Console](viewing_destination_console).

1.  [Creating and performing the data migration](creating_migration).

1.  [Monitor your data migration](monitoring_migration).

1.  [Finalizing the migration](finalizing_migration) (for streaming migrations only).

1.  [Applying excluded constraints](applying_constraints).
