description: Learn about creating sources to prepare for database migrations to Hybrid Manager.
---

*Sources* are databases you connected to the Hybrid Manager using the EDB DMS Agent (in reader mode) so you can use them for migrations.

To verify a source has been recognized by the EDB DMS Agent and is available for a migration: 

1.  In your HM Console, select the project you are using for the current migration. 

2.  From the left navigation menu, select **Migrate** > **Sources**. 

Each source's view shows the database name, database type (Postgres or Oracle), `cdcagent` ID, the current status, the source type, and more.

## More information

For a description of the available data on this page of the HM Console, see [Sources](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migrate/sources/).
