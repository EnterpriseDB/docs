Registering an Oracle database with the Hybrid Manager (HM) agent provides migration assessment and schema extraction capabilities.

To assess an Oracle database, the HM agent needs an Oracle user with access to the database and the necessary permissions to retrieve assessment data. These permissions are required for automated schema extraction and database migration assessment. The HM agent will still function if these roles aren’t assigned but in reduced feature capacity.

## Prerequisites 

Install Oracle's SQL\*Plus utility on the auxiliary machine you're using to run the HM agent.

## Create and configure an Oracle user

Create an Oracle user (a _common user_ for CDBs, regular user for non-CDBs) for schema extraction and assessment with the HM agent. You can use this same Oracle user later for data migration with the DMS agent. 

Alternatively, you can use an existing user if their current permissions meet the following requirements and aren't overly broad.

To create the user, log in to Oracle CDB as sysdba. Or, if you're using a non-CDB architecture, log in to your non-CDB database as sysdba.

The Oracle user you create needs access to these resources that allow it to connect, read schema metadata, and perform the assessment:

```
V$VERSION
V$INSTANCE
V$LICENSE
sys.all_tables
sys.all_tab_privs
```

It also needs `CREATE TABLE` permission and at least one of the following permissions:

```
SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE
SELECT ANY DICTIONARY
```

You will later specify this user in the `provider.onprem.databases.dsn` section of the HM agent configuration file.
