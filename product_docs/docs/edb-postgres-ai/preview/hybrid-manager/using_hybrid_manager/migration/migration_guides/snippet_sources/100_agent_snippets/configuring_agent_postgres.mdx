description: Configure the HM agent to connect to your Postgres database and perform a database assessment.

You can install and configure the Hybrid Manager (HM) agent to obtain observability and monitoring data for your Postgres database. This optional step provides high-level metrics like schema count and names, table count, and object count, which can aid in migration planning.

!!!note 
Configuring the HM agent isn't required to perform the migration, and it currently doesn't ingest the actual schema objects (DDL).
!!!

To register a database with the HM agent, see:
