navTitle: Creating migration

---

After you have configured the EDB DMS Agent (in reader mode) to establish connections to the Hybrid Manager (HM), create a new migration in the HM Console. A migration establishes a sync between the source database and a destination database with the help of EDB DMS.

1.  In the HM Console, select the project from which you want to manage the migration.

2.  Within your project, select **Migrate** > **Migrations**. 

3.  In the **Migrations** page, select **Create New Migration**. 

4.  In the **Create OLTP Migration** page, assign a **Name** to the migration. 

5.  Select the **Source** of the migration. The ID for the EDB DMS Agent is listed in the drop-down menu.

6.  Select the migration type, [**Snapshot**](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/terminology/#snapshot-migration) or [**Snapshot + Streaming**](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/terminology/#snapshot--streaming-migration).

7.  Under **Destination Type**, select an HM-managed destination database cluster and database for the migration. Then, select **Next**.

8.  Select the tables and columns to migrate. Modify the table and column names if needed.

9.  Select **Create Migration**.

The HM Console now displays a new migration.

If you chose the **Snapshot + Streaming** option, the EDB DMS Agent is constantly streaming data when the migration displays the **Running** state. Changes to data are replicated from the source to the destination database as long as the migration is running. 

!!!note

    The EDB DMS Agent in reader mode streams data changes. It does not stream changes in the DDL objects.
