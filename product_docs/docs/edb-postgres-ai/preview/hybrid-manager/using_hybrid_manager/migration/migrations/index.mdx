One of the main uses of Hybrid Manager (HM) is that it helps with planning and performing database migrations.

You can register an external Oracle or Postgres database with the HM agent (for example, [register an Oracle database with the agent](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/using_hybrid_manager/migration/migration_guides/oracle_to_hm_managed/agent_configuring_oracle/)). The **Migrations** tab that you can access from the **Estate** page then lists the external databases you registered along with a migration assessment that you can use for planning.

This is your first stop in the HM console when migrating external databases to HM.

## Migrations table

### Default columns

The default view of the table contains the following information for each analyzed database: 

**Database Name:** Name of the assessed database.

**Database Type:** Database type. See [Compatibility](compatibility.mdx) for currently supported database types.

**Resource ID:** Resource ID or `databases.resource_id` you assigned to a database in the `beacon_agent.yaml` configuration. See the HM agent's [parameter reference](../../monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/configure_agent.mdx#parameter-reference) for more information.

**Version:** Database version. See [Compatibility](compatibility.mdx) for currently supported versions.

**# or Cores:** Number of cores allocated to the database.

**# of Schemas:** Number of schemas in the assessed database that the DSN user has access to. Contains at least one table on which the DSN user has `SELECT` privileges. The DSN user is the source database user you specified while configuring the HM agent.

!!!note

   -   In Oracle databases, built-in `SYS` and `SYSTEM` schemas are excluded from the column count.

   -   The DSN user's schema is usually excluded if it has no tables. However, a known issue can cause it to be included when the DDL extractor creates temporary tables during extraction.

   -   The HM agent detects schema changes to tables and columns while running. However, changes to views or procedures aren't detected until you restart the HM agent.

**Engine:** This column applies to Postgres databases only and indicates the database server distribution, such as PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Advanced Server, or EDB Postgres Extended Server.

**Complexity:** This value is generated only for Oracle schemas and provides the level of complexity to migrate the database to HM. Possible values are:

-   **Very Easy:** The Oracle schema doesn't contain incompatible features or objects, and the data model is fully compatible with EDB Postgres Advanced Server. 

-   **Easy:** The migration is relatively straightforward. The database structure and features are compatible and require minimal adjustment. 

-   **Medium:** Requires moderate migration effort. Some database structures or features may require modification to get similar functionality in EDB Postgres Advanced Server. 

-   **Hard:** Requires significant effort and expertise. The database structures, features, or custom code in Oracle have significant differences or complexities that you need to address during the migration. 

-   **Very hard:** The migration is highly complex and demanding. Substantial differences in structures, features, and custom code between the Oracle and EDB Postgres Advanced Server databases require expertise so data, objects, and statements can be transformed. The code might have to be rewritten, or architectural redesign may be required.

**Migration LoE:** This value is generated only for Oracle schemas and represents the level of effort, in 8-hour working days, required to convert the schema and migrate data to HM. The estimation corresponds to the effort applied by members of EDB’s professional services who specialize in Oracle-to-Postgres migrations. This value considers database and schema-level assessments that include database features, schema complexity, data volume, and other factors to estimate the number of days.

**Status:** Current state of the migration. You can manually update the status from the database's [detailed view](migration_database_details_view) to reflect its progress.

### Other columns

You can use the gear icon to display additional columns: 

**Last assessed:** Period of time that's transpired since the database was last assessed to determine if the analysis is up to date.

**Management:** Shows whether the database is managed by you (self-managed), a cloud service provider, or HM.

**Project Name:** Project that was used for configuring the HM agent. It's the project you assign to an agent in `agent.project_id`. See the HM agent [parameter reference](../../monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/configure_agent.mdx#parameter-reference) for more information.

**Tags:** Labels assigned to the migration of a specific database in `databases.tags`. See the HM agent [parameter reference](../../monitoring/mon_ext_dbs/mon_with_agent/configure_agent.mdx#parameter-reference) for more information.

**TDS:** Total database size in GB. This includes database data only. Plan some additional space in the migration destination databases for metaobjects, temp and log files, and so on.

## Viewing and filtering the migrations table view

From the **Estate** page, the **Migration** tab displays a table-based analysis of all databases that you can migrate with HM after registering it with the HM agent. To customize how assessment results are displayed or filter databases, you can:

-   Enter a keyword to search for specific databases. The **Search** function uses the keyword to display databases with matching **Resource ID**, **Project Name**, and **Database Type** values.

-   Use the **Filter** selector to display databases by Postgres version and project name.

-   Order the results by newest to oldest, oldest to newest, and alphabetically.

-   Use the lightning icon to select how often to refresh the table. If the icon isn't enabled, the table isn't updated unless you manually refresh it. If **Auto refresh** is enabled, the table updates every 30 seconds. Alternatively, you can select one of the preconfigured intervals.

-   Customize the columns displayed in the **Migrations** tab using the gear icon. You can also reset the columns to the default state. 

-   Adjust the size of the table to your screen.
