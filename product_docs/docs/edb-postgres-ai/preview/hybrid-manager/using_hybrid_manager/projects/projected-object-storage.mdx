description: Learn about configuring dedicated object storage for projects with Hybrid Manager.
---

By default, all projects share the same object storage configured during the installation. If you need to isolate project resources, you can configure dedicated object storage for each project.

1. In the Hybrid Manager console (HM), select the **Projects** tab.
1. Select the project for which you want to configure dedicated object storage.
1. Get the project ID from the URL. The project ID is the string of characters after `/projects/` in the URL. 
   
   For example, in the URL `https://hybrid-manager.example.com/projects/prj_Abc123`, the project ID is `prj_Abc123`.
1. Normalize the project ID by replacing all underscores (`_`) with hyphens (`-`) and convert all letters to lowercase. For example, `prj_Abc123` becomes `prj-abc123`.
1. Configure another object storage by following the same steps you used during the [installation](/edb-postgres-ai/preview/hybrid-manager/install/environment_prep/#create-object-storage-secret):
   
1. Create the secret for the object storage in your Kubernetes cluster. Set the secret name as `edb-object-storage-<normalized-project-id>`.

   ```yaml
   apiVersion: v1
   kind: Secret
   metadata:
     name: edb-object-storage-<normalized-project-id>
     namespace: default
   ```

!!! Important
 - You can only configure dedicated object storage for your new project which hasn't been created with any resources, like Postgres clusters.
 - If you have multiple locations within HM, make sure to apply the above object storage secret to all locations.
