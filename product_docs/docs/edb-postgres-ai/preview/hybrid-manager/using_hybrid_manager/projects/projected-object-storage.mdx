description: Learn about configuring dedicated object storage for projects with Hybrid Manager.
---

By default, all projects share the same object storage configured during the installation. If you need to isolate project resources, you can configure dedicated object storage for each project.

1. In Hybrid Manager, select the **Projects** tab.
1. Select the project for which you want to configure dedicated object storage.
3. Get the project id from the URL. The project id is the string of characters after `/projects/` in the URL. For example, in the URL `https://hybrid-manager.example.com/projects/prj_Abc123`, the project id is `prj_Abc123`.
4. Normalize the project id by replacing all underscores (`_`) with hyphens (`-`) and convert all letters to lowercase. For example, `prj_Abc123` becomes `prj-abc123`.
5. Configure another object storage by following same steps during the installation, the only difference is when we create the secret for the object storage on kube, the name to the secret should be set to `edb-object-storage-<Normalized-project-id>`.

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: edb-object-storage-<normalized-project-id>
      namespace: default
    ```

> ⚠️ **Important:** You can only configure dedicated object storage for your **new project** which has not been created with any resources, like postgres clusters.
