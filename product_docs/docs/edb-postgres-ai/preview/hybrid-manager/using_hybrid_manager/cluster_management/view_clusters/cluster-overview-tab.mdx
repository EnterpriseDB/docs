description: Learn about getting a complete overview of a Hybrid Manager cluster.
---

The **Cluster Overview** tab shows a summary of the cluster's connection string, active alerts, and recent cluster activity.

If the cluster is a single node or primary/standby high-availability cluster, the overview  first shows the [Quick Connect](#getting-your-connection-string) section.

If the cluster is a distributed high-availability cluster, the overview first shows the [Data Groups](#data-groups) section.

## Getting your connection string

The **Quick Connect** section provides a full psql command line with a connection string configured for the cluster and a user with the edb_admin role to connect to the `edb_admin` database. You can copy this command and paste it into a terminal to connect to the database. (You need the password for the edb_admin user to connect to the database.)

## Data groups

Under **Data Groups**, view a summary of the data groups and witness groups in the cluster. Each group is listed with a status badge, the data group's name, and a **Data Group** or **Witness Group** label.

The status badge indicates the status of the data group. A green circle with a white tick indicates the data group is healthy. The other information displayed includes the time since creation, Postgres server type and version, and number of nodes in the data group.

-   To edit a data group's node settings and database configurations, next to the data group name, select **Edit Data Group**.

-   When you have more than one data group, you can delete data groups. (You can't delete all the data groups.) From the ellipsis menu, select **Delete Data Group**.  

-   To restore a data group you deleted, from the ellipsis menu, select **Restore Data Group**.

-   To perform a write leader switchover, from the ellispsis menu, select [**Switchover Write Leader**](#switchover-write-leader). 

Under **Quick Connect** for the data group, you can get the psql command line connection string for read-write and read-only connections. 

Select **Read-write** or **Read-only** to see the psql command line with a connection string configured for the data group and a user with the edb_admin role to connect to the `bdrdb` database. To connect to the database, you can copy this command and paste it into a terminal. To do so, you need the password for the edb_admin user.

!!! Note

    The **Read-only** connection string isn't available in Hybrid Manager 1.1.

To toggle the display of a cluster architecture diagram, select the **Cluster Architecture Diagram** heading. (The diagram is hidden by default.) This diagram shows the architecture of the cluster, including the data groups, witness groups and proxies, and the interconnection between them.

### Switchover Write Leader

Initiate a write leader switchover within an Advanced High Availability or Distributed High Availability cluster data group to seamlessly transfer the write leader role from one node to another. This zero-data-loss operation is designed to minimize downtime, ensuring that running applications experience a smooth transition with no lost transactions.

The write leader switchover serves several key purposes:

- **Planned maintenance**: Before taking a node offline for patching, an OS update, or hardware replacement, shift the write leader role to a healthy node, perform the necessary maintenance, and then switch the role back.
- **Routine testing**: Perform switchovers as part of regular disaster recovery drills to validate the process and ensure expected functionality during a real event.
- **Load balancing**: Move the write leader role to a different node to balance the workload across the cluster or to place the write leader closer to a specific group of applications.

More details are available in [Switching the write leader](/pgd/latest/routing/administering).

## Active alerts

The number of currently active alerts are listed in three categories: High Severity, Medium Severity, and Low Severity. Selecting the displayed counts opens the [**Monitoring**](cluster-monitoring-tab) tab, where you can view the alert details.

## Cluster activity log

You can view the recent activity logged on the cluster, including creation, configuration updates, and other major events in the cluster's lifecycle. Active elements don't appear here. For more details on the events, select the [**Logs**](cluster-logs-tab) tab.
