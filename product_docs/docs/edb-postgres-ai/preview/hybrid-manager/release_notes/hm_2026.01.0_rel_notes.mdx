| Enhancement | Added visibility into additional events (custom events and model cluster events) in the global **Activity Log** section accesible through the user's menu.                                                                                                                                                      | UPM-73565, UPM-73564, UPM-73563, UPM-73562, UPM-73575, UPM-73978, UPM-73251, UPM-73777, UPM-73488, UPM-73418, UPM-73537                                  |
| Enhancement | Added new critical alerts to monitor OOM-killed pods, backups exceeding 12 hours, and disk/WAL usage thresholds. Self-managed PGD clusters now have full feature parity for replication matrices and lag monitoring.                                                                                            | UPM-72143, UPM-73787, UPM-73766, UPM-68311, UPM-48857, UPM-65621, UPM-64957, UPM-72267, UPM-56826, UPM-72241, UPM-73285, UPM-65942, UPM-73814, UPM-72343 |
| Enhancement | HM now provides deeper deployment insights via pod-level status conditions in the cluster APIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | UPM-72414, UPM-73424, UPM-72290, UPM-73578, UPM-73749, UPM-73577, UPM-68958, UPM-73459, UPM-73081, UPM-73555, UPM-72534               |
