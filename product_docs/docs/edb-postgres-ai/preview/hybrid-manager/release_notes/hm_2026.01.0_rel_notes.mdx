|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhancement | The HM observability functionality has been upgraded with stacked charts for database sizes, historical chart annotations, and the ability to sync query tables with chart selections.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Enhancement | Added API capabilities to annotate host metrics charts. You can now display activity logs as vertical dotted lines within the host historical charts in a cluster’s **Monitoring** tab. This allows you to correlate specific cluster events with host performance fluctuations at exact points in time.                                                                                             |
| Enhancement | The  Grand Unified Configuration (GUC) `query_advisor.exclude_schema_list` now includes predefined default values. These defaults automatically exclude internal database schemas, ensuring that Query Advisor recommendations (index and stats metrics displayed in the **Recommendations** tab of a cluster) remain focused on user-defined data and are not cluttered by internal system objects. |
| Enhancement | The HM agent uninstalls on Debian are now cleaner and warning free.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Enhancement | Added visibility into additional events (custom events and model cluster events) in the global **Activity Log** section accesible through the user's menu.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Enhancement | Added new critical alerts to monitor pods terminated by Out Of Memory (OOM) events, backups exceeding 12 hours, and disk/WAL usage thresholds. Self-managed PGD clusters now have full feature parity for replication matrices and lag monitoring.                                                                                                                                                   |
| Enhancement | HM now provides deeper deployment insights via pod-level status conditions in the cluster APIs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
