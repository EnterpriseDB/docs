!!!

## Release highlights

- **Platform stability & flexibility:** You can now deploy Hybrid Manager (HM) on Microsoft Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). This support also extends to AI Pipelines and enables the Analytics Accelerator to utilize Azure DataLake and Blob Storage.

- **Security and identity control improvements:** You can now configure and integrate your own Identity Providers (IdP) directly from the HM console, streamlining user access management.

- **Migration visibility and assessment:** The Postgres database assessment now includes additional configuration items that provide visibility into migration complexity. Additional HM console information allows you to better track both active and completed data migrations for Oracle and Postgres sources.

- **Support for large-scale database migrations:** Enhanced the HM agent and DMS configuration to better and more efficiently support schema ingestion, database assessment, and concurrent migration of large numbers of external databases.

| Enhancement | HM now collects and displays cluster status metrics from self-managed EDB Failover Manager clusters.                             |
| Enhancement | HM now supports configuring dedicated object storage per HM project.                                                             |

### Migrations

| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature     | The HM console **Sources** and **Destinations** migration pages have been updated to display the `RW_SERVICE_HOST` environment variable setting needed by the DMS agent (packaged as `cdcagent`) to successfully connect to the HM instance. Displaying this variable enables users to retrieve this information in a self-service manner instead of needing to contact the HM administrator for it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Feature     | HM now automatically creates Migration Portal projects when Oracle database schemas are ingested into the Hybrid Manager by the HM agent (packaged as `beacon-agent`). This feature eliminates the need for users to manually create a Migration Portal project in most cases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Enhancement | The Postgres database details page **Assessment** tab has been updated to include new sections that list configuration items in the selected database that could impact the complexity of migrating to HM-managed databases. The following new sections have been added: <br/> - Extensions installed <br/> - Foreign servers <br/> - Foreign tables <br/> - Tablespaces <br/> - Installed procedural languages                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Enhancement | The **Migrate > Migrations** list view has been enhanced with the addition of the **Migration Type** and **Migration Progress** columns to facilitate monitoring of migration progress for all active and completed data migrations. The **Migration Type** column identifies whether a listed migration is a **Snapshot** only or **Snapshot + Streaming** type data migration. The **Migration Progress** column identifies the number of tables selected for the migration, the number of tables that have completed the snapshot phase, and the number of rows that have been migrated. For active data migrations, values for the number of snapshotted tables and migrated rows are refreshed automatically as the migration progresses. |
| Enhancement | Enhanced the HM agent and related services to better and more efficiently support ingestion and assessment of large numbers of external databases. Improvements were also made to the Data Migration Service (DMS) to better support large numbers of concurrent data migrations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Enhancement | The Data Migration Service (DMS) has been tested and certified to support migrations to HM-managed Postgres 18\* cluster databases, and from or to externally-managed Postgres 18\* databases. The HM Migration Portal has also been updated to support assessment and migration of Oracle databases to EDB Enterprise Postgres (Oracle Compatible) 18 databases.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

### AI Factory
