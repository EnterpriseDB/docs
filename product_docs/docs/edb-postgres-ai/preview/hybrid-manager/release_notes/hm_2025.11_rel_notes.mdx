**Release Date:** November 06, 2025

With Hybrid Manager 2025.11, we are adopting a new release strategy designed to deliver new capabilities and stability improvements to you faster and more predictably.

You will notice a change from the traditional version numbering (such as 1.3) to a date-based numbering scheme (such as 2025.11). This change supports our commitment to continuous delivery and clearer release cadences:

- Innovation/interim releases (monthly): These releases, such as 2025.11, are delivered monthly. They focus on continuous platform hardening, workflow improvements, technical debt reduction, and the introduction of smaller, iterative features.

- Long-term support (LTS) releases (bi-annual): Shipped approximately every six months, these releases consolidate major new features and user stories, providing a stable foundation.

This 2025.11 release is focused on platform hardening, filling technical gaps, and improving core user workflows to ensure stability as we move forward.

## Release highlights

- **GenAI Builder**: Introduced visual tools for creating and managing knowledge bases and enabled model review and configuration directly within the GenAI Builder.

- **Simplified analytics Lakehouse**: Enabled tiered tables configuration directly from the HM console and provided enhanced observability for Lakehouse queries and configurations.

- **Improved operational control**: Added the ability to initiate PGD write-leader switchovers directly from the HM console.

- **Enhanced diagnostics**: Expanded the database **Recommendations** tab to include proactive checks for configuration and security-related issues.

- **Migration progress visibility**: Added detailed migration progress visibility directly in the HM console, including table status and real-time migrated row counts.

### Enhanced AI usability: model and knowledge base management in the UI

Introduces critical UI enhancements to the GenAI Builder:

Knowledge base management: Users can now create, manage, and view all AIDB knowledge bases directly within the Hybrid Manager. All existing KBs created in the database are now visible from the GenAI Builder interface.

Model review and configuration: You can now review available models and add new ones directly from the UI. The interface provides essential model metadata, including context window limitations and optimal use cases, simplifying model selection and configuration for your RAG pipelines.

### Analytics and Lakehouse integration enhancements

Simplifies the management of your Postgres-native Lakehouse and enhances visibility into its operation:

Tiered tables configurable in the UI: The complex task of setting up tiered tables is now a simple UI action. Users can now select and convert an existing table into a tiered table structure directly within the HM console, removing the need to learn complex syntax or use command-line tools.

Improved observability for tiered tables: We've added deeper insights and visual metrics for tiered tables and Lakehouse queries. This provides clear, visual proof of the proper setup and expected functionality of your tiered table configurations, moving diagnostics from cumbersome command-line work to the console.

Unified Lakehouse integration view: Customers can now break down data silos by viewing connected external Apache Iceberg tables on the dedicated Lakehouse or Catalog page. This unified view eliminates the friction of working with disconnected data systems, allowing users to see and manage all their data in one central location.

### Streamlined EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) switchover

Transforms complex PGD write-leader switchover into a predictable and transparent process managed directly from the HM console:

PGD switchover from the HM console: You can now reliably initiate a PGD write-leader switchover directly from the cluster detailed view. This turns an expert-only task into a standard, low-risk operation, demonstrating the resiliency and manageability of your distributed system.

Enhanced node visibility: The cluster detailed view now lists all PGD group nodes, providing crucial visibility into the current topology and status before and after a switchover operation.

### Database migration progress visibility

Provides real-time feedback on your migration jobs, turning a complex process into a transparent and manageable workflow:

Detailed progress in the HM console: Hybrid Manager now displays comprehensive, real-time migration progress information directly in the HM console.

Table status and row counts: You gain visibility into the status of every table being migrated, including the real-time count of rows migrated and the migration rate. This allows customers to track data transfer progress without needing to check logs or external tools, significantly enhancing manageability.

### Proactive recommendations 

Enhances the proactive guidance available within the database **Recommendations** tab, helping you optimize performance and improve security:

New recommendation categories: The system now generates recommendations for two new critical categories: **Configuration** and *Security*.

Actionable configuration tuning: Recommendations now include suggestions for optimizing Postgres system parameters, such as tuning `shared_buffers`, to help users prevent bottlenecks and improve performance on managed databases.

Proactive security checks: The tab now flags potential security issues and provides actionable guidance to address them, ensuring continuous monitoring of your database environment's integrity.
