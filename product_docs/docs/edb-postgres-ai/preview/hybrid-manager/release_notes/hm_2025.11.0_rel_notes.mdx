### Model and knowledge base management in the GenAI Builder UI

Knowledge base management: Users can now create, manage, and view all AIDB knowledge bases directly within HM. All existing knowledge bases created in the database are now visible from the GenAI Builder interface.

Model review and configuration: You can now review available models and add new ones directly from the interface. The interface provides essential model metadata, including context window limitations and optimal use cases, simplifying model selection and configuration for your RAG pipelines.

### Analytics and Lakehouse integration

Tiered tables configurable in the HM console: The complex task of setting up tiered tables is now a simple HM console action. Users can now select and convert an existing table into a tiered table structure directly within the HM console.

Improved observability for tiered tables: We've added insights and visual metrics for tiered tables and Lakehouse queries. This provides visual proof of the setup and expected functionality of your tiered table configurations, moving diagnostics from the command-line to the HM console.

Unified Lakehouse integration: You can now view connected external Apache Iceberg tables on the dedicated Lakehouse or Catalog page. This unified view allow you to see and manage all your data in one central location.

### Streamlined switchover

Switchover from the HM console: You can now initiate a write-leader switchover for Advanced High Availability and Distributed High Availability clusters directly from the cluster detailed view. This turns an expert-only task into a low-risk operation.

Enhanced node visibility: The cluster detailed view now lists all group nodes of Advanced High Availability and Distributed High Availability clusters, providing crucial visibility into the current topology and status before and after a switchover operation.

### Migration progress visibility

Detailed progress in the HM console: HM now displays comprehensive, real-time migration progress information directly in the HM console.

Table status and row counts: You gain visibility into the status of every table being migrated, including the real-time count of rows migrated and the migration rate. This allows you to track data transfer progress without needing to check logs or external tools.

### Migration error history

Detailed error messaging in the HM console: HM migrations now include a migration **Error history** tab. This provides detailed error messages, including the error source, activity status, timestamp, and full log outputs to help you with troubleshooting.

### Migration assessment details for Postgres

Enhanced Postgres database details page: When an external Postgres database is registered and assessed for migration, the **Estate** view now provides expanded details, including information about extensions, foreign servers, foreign tables, procedural languages and tablespaces.

### Schema compatibility summary

Schema compatibility summary in the HM console: The Oracle database details page now includes a summary that describes database compatibility as reported by the Migration Portal project.

### Enhancements to the Migration Portal integration

JSON downloads: Added the ability to download a JSON-formatted version of Migration Portal schema assessment reports.

Improved reporting of dependent objects: Migration Portal now includes information on dependant objects and schemas to prevent related incompatibility issues. (for example, “relation x does not exit”).

### Proactive recommendations 

New recommendation categories: The system now generates recommendations for two new critical categories: **Configuration** and **Security**.

Configuration tuning: Recommendations now include suggestions for optimizing Postgres system parameters, such as tuning `shared_buffers`, to help you prevent bottlenecks and improve performance on managed databases.

Proactive security checks: The tab now flags potential security issues and provides actionable guidance to address them, ensuring continuous monitoring of your database environment's integrity.
