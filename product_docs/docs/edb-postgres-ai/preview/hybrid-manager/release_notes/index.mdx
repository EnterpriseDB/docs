!!!info Release cadence update
HM now follows a dual release strategy: **LTS** (for extended lifecycle support) and **Innovation Releases** (for monthly feature cadence). For details on this new model and our recommended versions, see [Hybrid Manager dual release strategy](#hybrid-manager-dual-release-strategy).

The EDB Hybrid Manager (HM) documentation describes the latest version of HM, including minor releases and patches. The release notes provide information on what was new in each release. For new functionality introduced in a minor or patch release, the content also indicates the release that introduced the feature.

## Hybrid Manager dual release strategy

To better meet the needs of continuous feature adoption and enterprise-grade stability, HM now follows a dual-track release strategy.

### LTS releases

LTS releases use traditional version numbering (for example, 1.2, 1.3) and are delivered approximately every six months. These releases serve as the foundation for your critical workloads.

**Focus**: Consolidating major new features, large user story implementations. These releases are supported by official patch releases (for example, 1.3.1) that include necessary bug and security fixes.

**Recommendation**: We strongly recommend LTS releases for all production deployments due to their maturity and long-term stability commitment.

### Innovation releases (IR)

Innovation releases use a date-based version numbering scheme (e.g., 2025.11, 2025.12) and are delivered monthly. These releases allow us to deliver value to you faster.

**Focus**: Continuous platform hardening, technical debt reduction, workflow improvements, and the introduction of smaller, iterative features. They provide early access to incremental improvements.

**Recommendation**: Innovation releases are ideal for testing, development, and non-critical environments where gaining immediate access to the latest improvements and features is prioritized over long-term stability and support commitments.
