!!!info Release cadence update
HM now follows a dual release strategy: **LTS** and **Innovation Releases**. For details on this new model, see [Hybrid Manager dual release strategy](#hybrid-manager-dual-release-strategy).
!!!

The EDB Hybrid Manager (HM) documentation describes the latest version of HM, including minor releases and patches. The release notes provide information on what was new in each release. For new functionality introduced in a minor or patch release, the content also indicates the release that introduced the feature.

## Hybrid Manager dual release strategy

With Hybrid Manager (HM) 2025.11, we are adopting a new release strategy designed to deliver new capabilities and stability improvements to you faster and more predictably.

You will notice that in addition to the traditional release scheme (with semantic versioning such as 1.3.0), we added a date-based release scheme (with version numbering such as 2025.11), which we are calling our Innovation Releases. This change supports our commitment to continuous delivery and clearer release cadences:

- **Innovation releases (monthly):** These releases, such as 2025.11, are delivered monthly. They focus on continuous platform hardening, workflow improvements, stability, reliability and the introduction of smaller, iterative features. They’re great for customers and teams that want to be on the leading edge of development, and see where we’re taking the product.

- **Long-term support (LTS) releases (bi-annual):** These releases, such as 1.3.0, are delivered twice a year. They consolidate the contents of previous Innovation Releases into a stable foundation for deployments requiring an extended support commitment. These LTS releases are supported with monthly patch releases, such as 1.3.1, that include bug and security fixes.
