## Features and enhancements

### Hybrid Manager (HM) platform

| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature     | HM now supports selective installations. Customize your deployment by enabling only the capabilities you need (Observability & DBaaS, Migrations, Analytics, AI) at install time or later. This reduces resource usage and simplifies component management.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Feature     | Added a new native chatbot interface that supports basic informational queries, direct SQL execution, and database management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Enhancement | Added support for deploying Postgres database clusters across three geographically separated locations, enabling advanced architectures where replica clusters or data groups can be deployed to other locations. This update allows for a zero-data-loss architecture through synchronous replication. Additionally, HM now supports deploying PGD-X Witness Groups in a third location to maintain quorum and prevent split-brain scenarios during automated failovers. |

### Observability and monitoring 

| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature     | Users can now use event annotations on time-series charts as delimiters for selecting time periods. This allows for easier isolation and analysis of data ranges associated with specific cluster events.                                                 |
| Enhancement | Added support for database monitoring of self-managed EFM and PGD clusters within HM. The HM agent funnels metrics, logs, and events from these external clusters into the central observability platform, providing a unified view of HA cluster health. |


### AI Factory

| Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Feature | Added support for accessing external services for model serving, allowing you to connect and use your own remote AI models. Use your existing model infrastructure to simplify integrating multiple models into your data pipelines, GenAI Builder applications, and HM chatbot. |


### Migrations

| Type             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhancement      | A new section has been added to the Postgres database details page to display tablespace usage. This view lists the count of object types by schema for each tablespace, helping users assess the complexity of migrating externally managed Postgres databases. |
| Platform support | HM migration features are now fully supported in air-gapped on-premise environments. This ensures that all migration capabilities function correctly in RKE and RHOS deployments without requiring external network access.                                      |
| Platform support | HM migration features are now fully supported on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), ensuring consistent functionality and performance for deployments in Azure environments.                                                                                        |
| Bug fix          | Fixed a Migration Portal issue introduced in the HM 2025.12 release which prevented existing databases to be used as the destination for online schema migrations.                                                                                               |
| Bug fix          | Fixed the Migration Portal analysis feature so it now identifies the use of the `PIVOT` operator in DDL and reports it as an incompatible feature.                                                                                                               |
| Bug fix          | Fixed the Migration Portal analysis feature so that it no longer inaccurately reports the `IS JSON CHECK CONSTRAINT` as an incompatible feature.                                                                                                                 |
