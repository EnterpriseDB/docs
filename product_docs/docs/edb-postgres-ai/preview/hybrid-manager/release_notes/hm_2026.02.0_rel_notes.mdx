### Hybrid Manager (HM) platform

| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | Jira ref, will be removed       |

| Feature     | Added a new native chatbot interface that supports basic informational queries, direct SQL execution via the /SQL command, and AI-backed operations for migrations and database management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | PROD-1065                       |
| Feature     | Hybrid Manager now supports a "Selective install" feature. Customize your deployment by enabling only the capabilities you need (Observability & DBaaS, Migrations, Analytics, AI) at install time or later. This reduces resource usage and simplifies component management.                                                                                                                                                                                             | PROD-882                        |
| Enhancement | Added support for deploying Postgres database clusters across three geographically separated locations, enabling advanced architectures where replica clusters or data groups can be deployed to other locations. This update allows for a zero-data-loss architecture through synchronous replication. Additionally, HM now supports deploying PGD-X Witness Groups in a third location to maintain quorum and prevent split-brain scenarios during automated failovers. | PROD-697                        |
| Enhancement | The chat experience has been refined to support managing conversation history; users can now **rename** and **delete** existing conversations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | UPM-76249, UPM-76248, UPM-77515 |
| Enhancement | The HM console now remembers the state of the chat sidebar (open/closed) and the specific conversation selected across page reloads.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | UPM-76262                       |
| Enhancement | Additionally, error handling in **SQL Mode** has been improved to display detailed error messages directly to the user, and the chat trigger is now correctly hidden if the "AI" scenario is not installed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | UPM-76312                       |

### Observability and monitoring 

| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | Jira ref, will be removed |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Enhancement | Added support for database monitoring of self-managed EFM and PGD clusters within Hybrid Manager. The HM agent funnels metrics, logs, and events from these external clusters into the central observability platform, providing a unified view of HA cluster health. | PROD-958                  |
| Feature     | Users can now use event annotations on time-series charts as delimiters for selecting time periods. This allows for easier isolation and analysis of data ranges associated with specific cluster events.                                                             | PROD-817                  |


### AI Factory

| Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Jira ref, will be removed |
|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Feature | Added support for accessing external services for model serving, allowing you to connect and use your own remote AI models. Use your existing model infrastructure to simplify integrating multiple models into your data pipelines and GenAI Builder applications. | PROD-882 |


### Migrations

| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Jira ref, will be removed |
|-------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| Enhancement | A new section has been added to the Postgres database details page to display tablespace usage. This view lists the count of object types by schema for each tablespace, helping users assess the complexity of migrating externally managed Postgres databases. | PROD-754                  |
| Other       | Hybrid Manager migration features are now fully supported in air-gapped on-premises environments. This ensures that all migration capabilities function correctly in RKE and RHOS deployments without requiring external network access.                         | PROD-1117                 |
| Other       | Hybrid Manager migration features are now fully validated and supported on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), ensuring consistent functionality and performance for deployments in Azure environments.                                                              | PROD-115                  |
