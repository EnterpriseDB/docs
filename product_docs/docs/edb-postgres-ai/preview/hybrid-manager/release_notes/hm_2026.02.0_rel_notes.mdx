| Feature     | HM now supports a selective installations. Customize your deployment by enabling only the capabilities you need (Observability & DBaaS, Migrations, Analytics, AI) at install time or later. This reduces resource usage and simplifies component management.                                                                                                                                                                                                             | PROD-1064                 |
| Feature     | Added a new native chatbot interface that supports basic informational queries, direct SQL execution, and database management.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | PROD-1065                 |
| Enhancement | Added support for deploying Postgres database clusters across three geographically separated locations, enabling advanced architectures where replica clusters or data groups can be deployed to other locations. This update allows for a zero-data-loss architecture through synchronous replication. Additionally, HM now supports deploying PGD-X Witness Groups in a third location to maintain quorum and prevent split-brain scenarios during automated failovers. | PROD-697                  |

### Observability and monitoring
