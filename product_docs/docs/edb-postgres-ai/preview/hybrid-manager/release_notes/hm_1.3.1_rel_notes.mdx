**Release Date:** October 28, 2025

This release includes bug fixes and security updates.

### HM console

- The total number of Postgres clusters on the HM console home page now correctly excludes individual cluster nodes (e.g., EFM or CNP replicas) to prevent inflated and inaccurate totals.
- Fixed an issue where the database connection information in the HM console's **Connect** tab incorrectly displayed 'edb_admin' instead of the required 'bdrdb' for Advanced High Availability and Distributed High Availability (PGD) clusters.
- The database size in the **Monitoring** tab of a cluster's detailed page now correctly displays storage metrics for self-managed clusters.
- Tags are now correctly displayed for active clusters on the **Deployment Details** page of the HM console.

### Advanced High Availability and Distributed High Availability (PGD)

- Corrected validation logic for `max_worker_processes` to ensure that GUC values for replica groups aren't incorrectly validated as lower than the primary group.
- Fixed an issue where submitting an empty GUCs configuration payload didn't preserve the existing settings, instead incorrectly triggering a reset to default values.
- Ensured that when duplicating a data group, the GUCs (such as `max_connections`) are properly included in the payload, preventing unnecessary validation failures.
- Resolved a bug that prevented the successful addition of a new PGD group.
- Fixed an issue that could cause PGD-X cluster creation to stall during the reconcile phase.
- When adding a new PGD data group, the database settings are now correctly duplicated from the first data group to maintain consistency.
- PGD cluster status visibility has been enhanced with new control plane resource (CR) status panels for cluster, clusterwrapper, and pgdgroup resources.
- The console now correctly reflects the effective `max_wal_size` of 8 GB in the HM console, resolving a discrepancy where the console displayed 1024 MB.
- The required `shared_preload_libraries` setting for PGD now correctly includes pgaa, or the HM console provides appropriate indication when the setting is incorrect.

### Backup, recovery & storage

- Fixed a bug where cluster metadata wasn't completely removed after the retention period, leaving orphaned Barman files in S3/object storage.
- WAL files marked as completed are no longer incorrectly retained beyond the configured limits.
- Resolved an issue with the upm-beacon agent component to stabilize the backup deletion process.
- The cross-location cluster restore functionality now correctly uses pg_basebackup as the method.

### Core platform functionality & API

- Fixed a bug that caused the `accm-server` to crash due to an invalid pod name format.
- Resolved an issue that could prevent cluster creation due to upper bounds limits on EKS.
- Fixed a bug that prevented the secondary location beacon dispatcher runner from connecting to the primary beacon-server.
- The **Model Profile Paths** field in the HM console is now correctly marked as optional during configuration.
- Fixed an API bug that caused certain status fields, such as `status.backupStatus`, to appear empty.
- Improved cluster metadata availability across the platform for enhanced reliability.
- Fixed an issue that caused an error when calling an LLM remotely, ensuring successful external API communication.
- Increased the default memory allocation for the beacon agent and server and made the limits configurable in the bootstrap values.
- Fixed a bug where a process group would cease retrying to connect after an hour, ensuring continuous attempts for connection and stability.
