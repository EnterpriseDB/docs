When creating new clusters, you can enable **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)** to [encrypt the data](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/tde/latest/about/what/) stored in your databases.

To [secure the data encryption key](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/tde/latest/secure_key/), you can either enter a passphrase of your choice, or bring your own key from a key management provider such as HashiCorp Vault or AWS Key Management Service.

!!!note
TDE is available for EDB Postgres Advanced Server and EDB Postgres Extended Server for version 15 and later.
!!!

First, ensure the Key Management System provider of your choice has been enabled in the `values.yaml`: 

-   [Adding KMS support](adding_kms_support.mdx)

Then, configure your Key Management System provider: 

-   [HashiCorp Vault](hashicorp.mdx)

-   [AWS KMS](aws_kms.mdx)

-   [Google Cloud KMS](google_cloud_kms.mdx)
