GenAI Builder is EDB's integration of [Griptape](https://www.griptape.ai/), a tool that allows you to build AI agents.

To enable the GenAI Builder launchpad application in your Hybrid Manager instance, you must create a secret for the application and configure dedicated object storage.

## Creating a secret for GenAI Builder

For EKS installations using the `eks-install-secrets.sh` script, you can skip key and secret creation and go to [Configure DataLake object storage](#configuring-datalake-object-storage-for-genai-builder), [CORS configuration](#configuring-cors), and [Backing up the Fernet key](#backing-up-the-fernet-key). Other EKS setups and operating systems require manual secret creation with the Fernet key.

1.  Create a Fernet key and store it in a variable:

    ```shell
    FERNET_KEY=$(dd if=/dev/urandom bs=32 count=1 2>/dev/null | base64)
    ```

    !!!note

    [Fernet](https://github.com/fernet/spec/) is a cryptographic library used by Python. It provides symmetric encryption/decryption and is required to store secret data.
    !!!

2.  Create a namespace for the integration:

    ```shell
    kubectl create namespace upm-griptape
    ```

3.  Create a secret that references the new Fernet key and is stored in the dedicated namespace: 

    ```yaml
    kubectl apply -f - <<EOF
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
       name: fernet-secret
       namespace: upm-griptape
    stringData:
       FERNET_KEY: ${FERNET_KEY}
    EOF
    ```

## Configuring DataLake object storage for GenAI builder

1.  Create a DataLake bucket in the object storage you're using for your Hybrid Manager deployment. GenAI Builder uses it to store structures, tools, and indexed data.

    <TabContainer>
    <Tab title="AWS S3">

    ```shell
    aws s3 mb s3://<your-griptape-datalake-bucket-name> –region     <your-region>
    ```

    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Google Cloud Storage (GCS)">

    ```shell
    gsutil mb -l <your-region> gs://<your-griptape-datalake-bucket-name>
    ```

    </Tab>

    <Tab title="Other S3-compatible storage">

    Use your provider’s management console or CLI to create a bucket with a unique name for your Griptape DataLake bucket.

    </Tab>
    </TabContainer>

2.  Capture the following information for your bucket. You will need it later when you first use the GenAI launchpad application. The console will prompt you for your DataLake bucket configuration, which requires: 

    -   `DATA_LAKE_ROOT_BUCKET`: The name of the bucket for use with DataLake. 

    -   `DATA_LAKE_S3_ACCESS_KEY`: The access_key used to connect to the DataLake bucket.

    -   `DATA_LAKE_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`: The secret_access_key used to connect to the DataLake bucket.

    -   `DATA_LAKE_S3_ENDPOINT_UR`: The endpoint URL used to connect to the DataLake bucket.

## Configuring CORS

<TabContainer>
<Tab title="AWS S3">

Update the bucket's settings to have the following [CORS configuration](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/enabling-cors-examples.html):

```txt
[
    {
        "AllowedHeaders": [
            "*"
        ],
        "AllowedMethods": [
            "PUT",
            "POST",
            "DELETE",
            "GET",
            "HEAD"
        ],
        "AllowedOrigins": [
            "https://${PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME}"
        ],
        "ExposeHeaders": []
    }
]
```

Where `https://${PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME}` is the domain configured for your Hybrid Manager.

</Tab>
    
<Tab title="Google Cloud Storage (GCS)">

The [S3 interoperability layer](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/aws-simple-migration) in GCS allows GenAI Builder to use GCS as an S3-compatible object store.

1.  In the GCS console, under **Settings**, turn on the s3 interoperability. 

2.  Update or [create a service account](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/service-accounts-create#creating_a_service_account) with the Storage Admin and Service Account Token Creator roles. 

3.  Create an [HMAC key pair](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/authentication/managing-hmackeys#console) for the service account.

4.  Create a config file with a CORS configuration that points at the Hybrid Manager endpoint:

    ```txt
    cat cors-config.json
    [
      {
        "origin": ["https://${PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME}"],
        "method": ["GET", "PUT", "POST", "DELETE", "HEAD"],
        "responseHeader": ["*"],
        "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
      }
    ]
    ```

    Where `https://${PORTAL_DOMAIN_NAME}` is the domain configured for your Hybrid Manager.

5.  Apply the CORS configuration to the previously created bucket:

    ```shell
    gsutil cors set cors-config.json gs://<bucket name>
    ```

</Tab>
    
<Tab title="Other S3-compatible storage">

Use your provider’s management console or CLI to configure cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) with Hybrid Manager.

</Tab>
</TabContainer>

After you've configured the secret and created a dedicated bucket, continue with [Hybrid Manager installation](/edb-postgres-ai/current/hybrid-manager/install/).

## Backing up the Fernet key

The Hybrid Manager administrator must keep the Fernet key safe and back it up.

Fetch the key: 

```shell
kubectl get secret -n upm-griptape fernet-secret -o yaml
```

Store the key safely.
