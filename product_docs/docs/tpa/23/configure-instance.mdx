This is an overview of the TPA settings you can use to
customize the deployment process on cluster instances.

There's also [an overview of configuring a cluster](configure-cluster/), which explains
how to use cluster and instance variables together to write a concise,
easy-to-review `config.yml`.

## System-level configuration

The first thing TPA does is to ensure that Python is bootstrapped
and ready to execute Ansible modules (a distribution-specific process).
Then it completes various system-level configuration tasks before it
[configures Postgres](#postgres).

-   [Distribution support](reference/distributions/)
-   [Python environment](reference/python/) (`preferred_python_version`)
-   [Environment variables](reference/target_environment/) (for example, `https_proxy`)

### Package repositories

You can use the
[pre-deploy hook](tpaexec-hooks/#pre-deploy)
to execute tasks before any package repositories are configured.

-   [Configure YUM repositories](reference/yum_repositories/)
    (for RHEL, Rocky, and AlmaLinux)

-   [Configure APT repositories](reference/apt_repositories/)
    (for Debian and Ubuntu)

-   [Configure 2ndQuadrant and EDB repositories](reference/2q_and_edb_repositories/)
    (on any system)

-   [Configure a local package repository](reference/local-repo/)
    (to ship packages to target instances)

You can use the
[post-repo hook](tpaexec-hooks/#post-repo)
to execute tasks after package repository configuration. For example,
you can use it to correct a problem with the repository configuration before installing
any packages.

### Package installation

Once the repositories are configured, packages are installed at various
stages throughout the deployment, beginning with a batch of system
packages:

-   [Install non-Postgres packages](reference/packages/)
    (for example, acl, openssl, sysstat)

Postgres and other components (for example, Barman, repmgr, pgbouncer) are
installed separately according to the cluster configuration. See [Other components](#other-components).

### Other system-level tasks

-   [Create and mount file systems](reference/volumes/) (including RAID,
    LUKS setup)
-   [Upload artifacts](reference/artifacts/) (files, directories,
    tar archives)
-   [Set sysctl values](reference/sysctl_values/)
-   [Configure /etc/hosts](reference/hosts/)
-   [Manage ssh_known_hosts entries](reference/manage_ssh_hostkeys/)
-   [Add system locale](reference/locale/)

### Skipping deployment completely

To prevent TPA from doing any part of the deployment process on an
instance - in other words, if you want TPA to provision the instance and
then leave it alone - set the `provision_only` setting for the instance
to `true` in `config.yml`. This setting will make TPA omit the instance
entirely from the inventory which `tpaexec deploy` sees.

## Postgres

Postgres configuration is an extended process that's interleaved with the configuration of
other components like repmgr and pgbouncer. The first step is to install Postgres.

### Version selection

Use the [configure options](tpaexec-configure/#software-versions) to
select a Postgres flavor and version, or set `postgres_version` in
`config.yml` to specify the Postgres major version you want to install.

That's all you need to do to set up a working cluster. Everything
else described here is optional. You can control every aspect of the
deployment if you want to, but the defaults are carefully selected to give
you a sensible cluster as a starting point.

### Installation

The default `postgres_installation_method` is to install packages for
the version of Postgres you selected, along with various extensions,
according to the architecture's needs:

-   [Install Postgres and Postgres-related packages](reference/postgres_installation_method_pkg/)
    (for example, pglogical, BDR, and so on)

-   [Build and install Postgres and extensions from source](reference/postgres_installation_method_src/)
    (for development and testing)

Whichever installation method you choose, TPA can give you the same
cluster configuration with a minimum of effort.

### Configuration

-   [Configure the postgres Unix user](reference/postgres_user/)

-   [Run initdb to create the PGDATA directory](reference/initdb/)

-   [Configure pg_hba.conf](reference/pg_hba.conf/)

-   [Configure pg_ident.conf](reference/pg_ident.conf/)

-   [Configure postgresql.conf](reference/postgresql.conf/)

You can use the
[postgres-config hook](tpaexec-hooks/#postgres-config)
to execute tasks after the Postgres configuration files are
installed (for example, to install additional configuration files).

Once the Postgres configuration is in place, TPA
installs and configures other components, such as Barman, repmgr,
pgbouncer, and haproxy, according to the details of the architecture.

## Other components

-   [Configure Barman](reference/barman/)
-   [Configure pgbouncer](reference/pgbouncer/)
-   [Configure haproxy](reference/haproxy/)
-   [Configure HARP](reference/harp/)
-   [Configure EFM](reference/efm/)

### Configuring and starting services

TPA installs systemd service unit files for each service.
The service for Postgres is named `postgres.service`. You can use
`systemctl start postgres` to start it and `systemctl stop postgres`
to stop it.

If you're deploying a cluster for the first time, TPA starts the Postgres service at this point.
On an existing cluster, if there are any relevant configuration changes, TPA reloads or restarts
the Postgres service as appropriate. If there are no changes and Postgres is already running, it
leaves the service alone. (If Postgres isn't running on an existing cluster, TPA starts it.)

In any case, Postgres is running at the end of this step.

## After starting Postgres

-   [Create Postgres users](reference/postgres_users/)

-   [Create Postgres tablespaces](reference/postgres_tablespaces/)

-   [Create Postgres databases](reference/postgres_databases/)

-   [Configure pglogical replication](reference/pglogical/)

-   [Configure .pgpass](reference/pgpass/)

You can use the
[postgres-config-final hook](tpaexec-hooks/#postgres-config-final)
to execute tasks after the post-startup Postgres configuration is
complete (for example, to perform SQL queries to create objects or load data).

-   [Configure BDR](reference/bdr/)

You can use the
[post-deploy hook](tpaexec-hooks/#post-deploy)
to execute tasks after the deployment process is complete.
