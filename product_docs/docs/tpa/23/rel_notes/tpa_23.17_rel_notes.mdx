title: Trusted Postgres Architect 23.17 release notes 
navTitle: "Version 23.17"
---


New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Trusted Postgres Architect 23.17 include the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Enhancement | Added a new `--pgd-proxy-routing` parameter to the configure command. This can be set to `global` or `local`. Local routing will make every PGD-Proxy route to a write leader within its own location. Global routing will make every proxy route to a single write leader, elected amongst all available data nodes across all locations. |
| Change | Removed the `--active-locations` parameter from the configure command. |
| Enhancement | TPA now supports Ubuntu 22.04 |
| Change | Updated the AWS AMIs used for RHEL 7 and 8. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue whereby TPA would incorrectly remove groups from existing Postgres users. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue whereby TPA would print an unhelpful error message when a git commit failed. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue whereby group names were incorrectly sanitized and uppercase letters were converted to underscores rather than lowercase ones. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue whereby Postgres was not restarted when required after CAMO configuration. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue with etcd changes, ensuring that they are now idempotent and avoiding unnecessary restarts of etcd on subsequent deployments. |
