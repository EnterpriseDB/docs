title: Trusted Postgres Architect 23.20 release notes 
navTitle: "Version 23.20"
---


New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Trusted Postgres Architect 23.20 include the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| New feature | TPA now supports upgrades from PGD 4 to PGD 5 by running the new command `tpaexec reconfigure` to generate a revised config.yml and then `tpaexec upgrade` to perform the upgrade. |
| Enhancement | Added a new subcommand `tpaexec info validate` that runs a checksum over the TPA installation and confirms that it matches the one distributed with the package. |
| Change | The `update-postgres` command has been replaced with the more general `upgrade` command. |
| Change | TPA now explicitly adds `tzdata-java` when installing OpenJDK for Failover Manager on RHEL 8 or 9. This is a workaround for [this OpenJDK bug](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7025428). |
| Change | TPA now uses the latest available Debian AMIs on AWS (latest at the time of this release). |
| Change | TPA now runs `tpaexec provision` automatically as part of `tpaexec deploy` or `tpaexec upgrade` if config.yml has changed. |
| Bug fix | Fixed a bug whereby TPA could attempt to use a non-existent user when running pgd-cli on pgd-proxy nodes. |
| Bug fix | Fixed a bug whereby changes made by `tpaexec relink` were not committed to the Git repository correctly. |
