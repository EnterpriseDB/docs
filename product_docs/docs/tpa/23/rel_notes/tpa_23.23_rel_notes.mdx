Released: 21 Sep 2023

New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Trusted Postgres Architect 23.23 include the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Enhancement | TPA now supports PostgreSQL 16. Please note, PostgreSQL 16 packages are not yet available in all supported repos, so not all configurations will work until this is the case. |
| Change | When Postgres 16 or above is selected, TPA will not add any 2ndQuadrant repos by default. TPA will explicitly set `tpa_2q_repositories: []` in this case. |
| Change | EFM is now configured to use JDK 11 by default on platforms where it is available. |
| Change | Where no EDB Repositories are use, TPA will not exclude any packages from PGDG (previously Barman and psycopg2 were excluded). |
| Change | Added package names for etcd and Patroni to support installation on SLES. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue whereby Apache HTTPD service for PEM Server would not start on boot. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue whereby pg_backup_api tests were run with incorrect permissions causing them to fail. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue whereby Apache HTTPD service for pg_backup_api would not start on boot. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue whereby `bdr.standby_slot_names` and `bdr.standby_slots_min_confirmed` checks used the incorrect schema on bdr3 clusters. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue whereby configuration keys for extensions were passed to Patroni in the incorrect format, resulting in 'WARNING: Removing unexpected parameter'. |
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue when using the intermediate base image option for `docker_images` whereby the resulting image name was incorrect. |
