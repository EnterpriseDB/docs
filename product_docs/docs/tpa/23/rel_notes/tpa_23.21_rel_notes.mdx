title: Trusted Postgres Architect 23.21 release notes 
navTitle: "Version 23.21"
---


New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Trusted Postgres Architect 23.20 include the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Change | TPA is now an open source project, the source is available under the GPLv3 license from [GitHub](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/tpaexec) |
| Change | The default M1 configuration now uses EDB Repos 2.0 if any EDB software is selected, otherwise PGDG is used. This only affects new clusters. |
| Change | You must now choose a failover manager explicitly when running `tpaexec configure` with the M1 architecture. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue with creation of PGD subscriber-only nodes whereby TPA incorrectly required 'subscriber-only' to be set on the replica instead of the upstream instance. |
| Bug fix | TPA will now skip inapplicable tasks when deploying to containers even if you are using the 'bare' platform option (previously these were skipped only if 'docker' was selected). |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue with permissions on `/etc/edb` whereby if you added the pgd-proxy role to a data node in a deployed PGD5 cluster, pgd-proxy would fail to start because it did not have permissions to open pgd-proxy-config.yml. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue whereby `/var/log/postgres` could end up with inappropriate permissions (0600) if a strict umask was set |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue whereby repeating `tpaexec deploy` on a Barman instance correctly registered with PEM would lose the PEM Agent Barman configuration. |
