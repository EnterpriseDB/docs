Released: 12 Jul 2023

New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Trusted Postgres Architect 23.19 include the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| New feature | TPA now allows the creation of physical replicas of subscriber-only PGD nodes. |
| New feature | TPA now supports the configuration of HTTP(S) HARP and PGD Proxy health probes. |
| New feature | TPA now allows you to select Patroni as a failover manager with the M1 architecture. This support is experimental and not yet recommended for use in production. |
| Enhancement | TPA now allows you to set specific versions for edb-pgd-proxy and edb-bdr-utilities rather than always using the latest version. |
| Change | On Debian-like systems, the package selection code now uses -dbg rather than -dbgsym for certain packages where applicable. |
| Change | When configuring replication slots, TPA will now ensure that only valid characters are used in the primary_slot_name. Previously TPA would use the inventory_hostname as a default, which could contain hyphens; these are now replaced with underscores. |
| Change | The default Failover Manager version is now 4.7. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue whereby PGD 3.7 to 4 upgrades would fail in TPA 23.18. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue whereby TPA would include underscores in TLS certificate Common Names when deploying PEM. This is invalid and would result in failure on some platforms. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue whereby an incorrect etcd service name would be used on Debian-like platforms, preventing TPA from starting etcd. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue whereby TPA could not install etcd packages on RHEL 8. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue whereby the message `Failed to commit files to git: b''` would be displayed during configure. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue whereby TPA would erroneously generate and overwrite Postgres user passwords when `generate_password: false`. |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue whereby volume map creation on AWS failed to take account of region resulting in failures when using regions other than eu-west-1. |
