product: Trusted Postgres Architect
version: 23.37.0
date: 19 March 2025
intro: |
  New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Trusted Postgres Architect 23.37.0 include the following:
highlights: |
  - The `upgrade` command now supports minor-version upgrades of Postgres in Patroni and EFM clusters
  - Upgrades in repmgr clusters have also been improved
relnotes:
- relnote: Fixed `patronictl switchover` command usage
  details: >
    TPA will now correctly use `--leader` instead of the deprecated
    `--master` parameter when using `patronictl switchover` command.
  jira:
  - TPA-944
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: low
- relnote: Fixed `shared_preload_libraries` computation during deploy
  details: >
    Fixed a limitation of Ansible's handling of list ordering that would trigger
    unneeded and uncontrolled rewriting of the `shared_preload_libraries` and subsequently
    require a Postgres service restart, even on second deployment scenarios with no
    changes to the configuration.
  jira:
  - TPA-946
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: medium
- relnote: Separated changed from unchanged tasks in output
  details: In TPA's default output plugin, tasks which return "ok" but with no changes
    are now separated from ones that have reported changes, which are now highlighted
    in yellow.
  jira:
  - TPA-952
  type: Enhancement
  impact: low
- relnote: Fixed an issue whereby unnecessary replication slots were created when configuring Patroni
  details: When setting up a Patroni cluster, a replication slot was created for each
    etcd-only node. This caused problems because the unused slots cause the WAL to
    accumulate. Slots are now only created for the DB servers.
  jira:
  - TPA-823
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: medium
- relnote: Minor-version Postgres upgrades for M1 + Patroni clusters
  details: >
    TPA can now upgrade Postgres to the latest minor version on an M1 cluster
    which uses Patroni as the failover manager. The upgrade process stops Barman on
    any Barman server in the cluster, then upgrades the replicas in the cluster. Then
    it switches to one replica as a temporary primary, upgrades Postgres on the original
    primary, and switches back to the original primary. Patroni's handling of the
    cluster is paused during the process and resumed afterwards. Then Barman is restarted
    and cluster health checks are run.
  jira:
  - TPA-688
  type: Enhancement
  impact: high
- relnote: Fixed an issue with counting instances in BDR-Always-ON clusters containing PEM
  details: >
    Fixed a bug whereby in certain circumstances, TPA would incorrectly calculate
    the number of instances in a BDR-Always-ON cluster with a PEM server, causing
    "tpaexec configure" to fail with "StopIteration".
  jira:
  - TPA-937
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: low
- relnote: Improved minor-version Postgres upgrade for M1 + repmgr clusters
  details: >
    Witness nodes were previously omitted from upgrade, they are now
    upgraded along with replicas. Postgres service restart is now more
    reliable and always run right after the package upgrade on the node
    is finished.
  jira:
  - TPA-898
  type: Enhancement
  impact: high
- relnote: TPA will now copy EFM config files if they are removed, even if no configuration changes
  details: >
    If either the `efm.nodes` or `efm.properties` configuration files do not
    exist in the top-level EFM directory, the `efm upgrade-conf` command copies them
    from the `/raw` directory, even if there have been no configuration changes. This
    amends previous behavior that required a configuration change before the `upgrade-conf`
    command would run and copy files.
  jira:
  - TPA-899
  type: Change
  impact: medium
- relnote: TPA will now verify that the URI for EDB repository setup is accessible
  details: >
    The EDB repos are set up using the setup script following the
    EDB Repos 2.0 documentation: piping the cURL output to bash for execution. However,
    if a user passes a nonexistent `EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN` or repository to cURL,
    the exit code gets silently swallowed and replaced with a 0 because bash executes
    an empty input. In this version, a request is dispatched to a repository's GPG key endpoint to
    ensure a `404` response is not returned *before* continuing to download the setup
    script. Additionally, tasks related to EDB repository set up are now skipped if the repository
    has already been set up.'
  jira:
  - TPA-939
  - TPA-689
  - TPA-633
  type: Change
  impact: medium
- relnote: Fixed an issue whereby a PEM server could be incorrectly picked as a cluster primary in EFM cluster.
  details: >
    If a cluster is created with a pem-server, that backend is not monitored
    by EFM, hence, that node shouldn't be included when discovering a Postgres primary
    for the entire cluster. This behavior is now correctly implemented by TPA.
  jira:
  - TPA-929
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: low
- relnote: Fixed duplicated lines in .pgpass files
  details: > 
    Fixed a bug whereby extra lines could be added to .pgpass for the same
    user when re-running 'tpaexec deploy'.
  jira:
  - TPA-928
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: low
- relnote: Improved the speed of Docker instance deprovisioning
  details: >
    When deprovisioning docker instances, TPA now kills the container instead
    of stopping it, and does so to all the instances in parallel.
  jira:
  - TPA-903
  type: Enhancement
  impact: low
- relnote: TPA will now raise an ArchitectureError when BDR-Always-ON is configured with BDR version
    5
  details: >
    An architecture error is now raised during `tpaexec configure` if `--bdr-version
    5` is passed with `-a BDR-Always-ON` alerting the user that BDR version 5 should
    be used with `PGD-Always-ON`.
  jira:
  - TPA-742
  type: Change
  impact: low
- relnote: Minor-version Postgres upgrades for M1 + EFM clusters
  details: >
    TPA can now upgrade Postgres to the latest minor version on an M1 cluster
    which uses EFM as the failover manager. The upgrade process stops Barman on any
    Barman server in the cluster, then upgrades the replicas in the clusters. Then
    it switches to one replica as a temporary primary, upgrades Postgres on the original
    primary, and switches back to the original primary. The EFM agent is started and
    stopped on the different servers at the correct times. Then Barman is restarted
    and cluster health checks are run.
