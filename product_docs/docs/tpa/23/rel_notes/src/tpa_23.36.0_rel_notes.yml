product: Trusted Postgres Architect
version: 23.36.0
date: 19 February 2025
intro: |
  New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Trusted Postgres Architect 23.36.0 include the following:
highlights: |
  - Support for Ubuntu 24.04 and SLES 15 SP6
  - Version specifiers for all cluster components
  - Better support for EDB Failover Manager (EFM) 5
relnotes:
  - relnote: Added support for Ubuntu Noble 24.04
    details: >-
      TPA runs on Ubuntu 24.04 and supports this OS as a target host.
      **EDB packages for Ubuntu 24.04 will be generally available
      at the end of March 2025. Before that, deployments needing EDB 
      packages will likely fail.**

  - relnote: Fixed an issue with `shared_preload_libraries` on Patroni clusters
    details: >-
      Entries in shared_preload libraries are now treated correctly by Patroni.
      This fixes a bug whereby adding the pglogical extension to a Patroni
      cluster via `config.yml` would fail.

  - relnote: Support package version specifiers for all cluster components
    details: >-
      The following software packages now accept an
      `--xxx-package-version` option to the `tpaexec configure` command, which
      populates `xxx_package_version` in the generated `config.yml` - barman -
      pgbouncer - beacon-agent - etcd - patroni - pem-server - pem-agent -
      pg_backup_api - pgd_proxy - pgdcli - repmgr.

  - relnote: >-
      Fixed a bug whereby deploys would fail for distributions which have no additional repository setup
      commands for extensions
    details: >-
      In previous versions of TPA, when `postgis` was added to `extra_postgres_extensions` or the `extensions`
      list of a database in `postgres_databases`, deploys would fail for Debian, SLES
      and Ubuntu because their list of `repository_setup_commands` was empty
      (only RHEL has an additional command to run`crb enable`). This empty list
      was passed to the `command` module, which would fail
      with `no command given`, resulting in deployment failure. The
      `Automatically run additional repository setup commands for recognized
      extensions` task is now skipped if the distribution has no additional
      commands to run.

  - relnote: Fixed an issue whereby TPA attempted to create replication slots even when
      `repmgr_use_slot` was set to 0

  - relnote: Use the latest Barman from PGDG on RHEL-like systems
    details: >-
      TPA previously defaulted to Barman 3.9 when installing from PGDG on a
      RHEL-like system, as a workaround for broken packages. More recent
      barman packages are OK, so we now let yum install the latest packages.
    jira:
      - TPA-847
    type: Change
    impact: low

  - relnote: Set up EDB repositories via setup script for RedHat and Debian
    details: >-
      This change simplifies EDB repository setup on TPA nodes into a
      single task for `dnf`, `yum` and `apt` package
      managers. This should reduce the occurrence of unexpected HTTP
      errors when adding EDB repositories to target hosts.
    jira:
      - TPA-689
    type: Change
    impact: low

  - relnote: Support EFM 5 "auto resume" properties
    details: >-
      Starting with EFM 5.0, the `auto.resume.period` property has been broken
      into two properties, one for the startup case and one for the db failure
      case. This change adds the correct properties based on the `efm_version`
      being used.
    jira:
      - TPA-892
    type: Change
    impact: low

  - relnote: Fixed documentation for `efm_conf_settings`
    details: >-
      Previously, documentation stated *"You can use efm_conf_settings to set
      any parameters, whether recognized by TPA or not. Where needed, you need
      to quote the value exactly as it would appear in efm.properties"*
      However, the `efm.properties.j2` template uses the values from
      `efm_conf_settings` as an Ansible dictionary, so the entries must be
      written in `key: value` form. ```yaml cluster_vars: efm_conf_settings:
      notification.level: WARNING ping.server.ip: <well known address in the
      network> ```
    jira:
      - TPA-886
    type: Change
    impact: low

  - relnote: Fixed an issue whereby databases were created with the default parameters rather
      than as configured
    details: >-
      In previous versions of TPA, in order to suppress the `CREATE EXTENSION` statement for extensions that do not
      require it (aka 'modules'), the entire `postgres_databases` hash was modified. This
      introduced a bug, since a new hash was created that ONLY contained the
      database `name` and list of `extensions`, ignoring all other configuration
      settings for the database (`owner`, `template`, `encoding` etc). This
      resulted in databases being created with the default parameters rather
      than as configured. To fix this, the modules are removed from the list of
      extensions and the resulting list is passed to the task which runs CREATE
      EXTENSION.

  - relnote: Support EFM 'backup.wal' property.
    details: >-
      Starting with EFM 5.0, a new property 'backup.wal' has been added. This
      change adds the new property if the version of EFM is 5 or higher.
    jira:
      - TPA-893
    type: Change
    impact: low

  - relnote: >-
      Set `bdr_client_dsn_attributes` as the default for
      `pgd_proxy_dsn_attributes` and `pgd_cli_dsn_attributes`
    details: >-
      Because pgd-proxy and pgd-cli are written in Go and use a Go driver, they
      do not support the full set of parameter keywords supported by libpq. In
      the case a cluster has installed pgd-proxy and/or pgd-cli and has
      configured `bdr_client_dsn_attributes` with parameters that the Go driver
      does *not* support, two new configuration variables must be included:
      `pgd_proxy_dsn_attributes` and `pgd_cli_dsn_attributes`, containing only
      additional DSN parameters that the Go driver supports. Conversely, if
      pgd-proxy and pgd-cli are installed and `bdr_client_dsn_attributes` does
      not include any Go-incompatible parameters, the connection strings for
      these tools will be configured with the attributes in
      `bdr_client_dsn_attributes`. This amends unexpected behavior where the
      `pgd_proxy_dsn_attributes` and `pgd_cli_dsn_attributes` were defaulting to
      empty strings when not defined, even though the user was expecting the
      parameters in `bdr_client_dsn_attributes` to be used.

  - relnote: Use standard form of home directory for etcd
    details: >-
      When creating the etcd user, TPA now refers to its home directory without
      a trailing slash, matching the usage of other tools like 'useradd'.
    jira:
      - TPA-907
    type: Bug Fix
    impact: low

  - relnote: Bump Python dependency to version 3.12
    details: >-
      TPA now requires Python 3.12. When installing TPA from EDB Repos 2.0, 
      an appropriate Python interpreter will be installed automatically.
    jira:
      - TPA-734
    type: Change
    impact: low

  - relnote: Wait for protocol version update during PGD upgrade
    details: >-
      During upgrade from PGD3 to PGD5, the protocol version update may take
      some time. The PGD 5 specific config changes will fail if they are attempted
      before the protocol version change. We have added a wait to avoid such
      failures.
    jira:
      - TPA-904
    type: Change
    impact: low

  - relnote: Use SLES 15 SP6 as the standard SLES for nodes
    details: >-
      When SLES is requested at configure-time, TPA will now install SLES 15 SP6.
      The docker and EC2 images are now SP6, and the systemd-sysvcompat package
      is installed on SLES, so that local boot-time scripts continue to work.
    jira:
      - TPA-901
    type: Change
    impact: low

  - relnote: >-
      Update `<clustername>.nodes` when new nodes are added to an existing EFM
      cluster
    details: >-
      In previous versions of TPA, when a new EFM node was added to `config.yml`, it was not listed in the
      `Allowed node host list` on the existing EFM nodes in the cluster. The
      task which executes `efm upgrade-conf` and propagates the changes from
      `/raw/<clustername>.properties` and `/raw/<clustername>.nodes` is now run
      when EITHER of these files are changed. This results in the new EFM node
      being written to the `<clustername>.nodes` file and `efm cluster-status`
      including it in the `Allowed node host list`.
    jira:
      - TPA-848
    type: Change
    impact: low

  - relnote: Fixed an issue whereby the `cluster_ssh_port` setting was not respected by Barman
    details: >-
      The Barman configuration is now able to use custom ssh port set via the
      `cluster_ssh_port` in `config.yml`, which defaults to 22 if it is not set.
      The `-p`/`--port` flags are now included in the `ssh` command in
      `barman.d.conf` and `barman-wal-restore`/`barman-wal-archive' commands
      respectively.
    jira:
      - TPA-900
    type: Bug Fix
    impact: low

  - relnote: Include `PGPORT` in the postgres user's `.bashrc` file
    details: >-
      The `PGPORT` environment variable will now be exported as part of the
      postgres user's `.bashrc` file. It defaults to the port value used by the
      selected `postgres_flavour`, or `postgres_port` if specified in the config
      file.
