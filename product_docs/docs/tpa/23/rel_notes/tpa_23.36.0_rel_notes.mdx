## Changes

<table class="table w-100"><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th width="10%">Addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><details><summary>Add support for Ubuntu Noble 24.04</summary><hr/><p>TPA runs on Ubuntu 24.04 and supports this OS as a target host. <strong>NOTE: EDB packages for Ubuntu 24.04 will be generally available at the end of March 2025. Before that, deployments needing EDB  packages will likely fail.</strong></p></details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Use latest barman from PGDG on RHEL-like systems</summary><hr/><p>TPA previously defaulted to Barman 3.9 when installing from PGDG on a RHEL-like system, as a workaround for broken packages. More recent barman packages are OK, so we now let yum install the latest packages.</p></details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Set up EDB repositories via setup script for RedHat and Debian</summary><hr/><p>This change simplifies EDB repository setup on TPA nodes into a single task for <code>dnf</code>/'yum' and <code>apt</code> package managers. This should reduce the occurrence of unexpected HTTP errors when adding EDB repositories to target hosts.</p></details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Support EFM 5 &quot;auto resume&quot; properties</summary><hr/><p>Starting with EFM 5.0, the <code>auto.resume.period</code> property has been broken into two properties, one for the startup case and one for the db failure case. This change adds the correct properties based on the <code>efm_version</code> being used.</p></details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Fix documentation for <code>efm_conf_settings</code></summary><hr/><p>Previously, documentation stated <em>&quot;You can use efm_conf_settings to set any parameters, whether recognized by TPA or not. Where needed, you need to quote the value exactly as it would appear in efm.properties&quot;</em> However, the <code>efm.properties.j2</code> template uses the values from <code>efm_conf_settings</code> as an Ansible dictionary, so the entries must be written in <code>key: value</code> form. <code>yaml cluster_vars: efm_conf_settings: notification.level: WARNING ping.server.ip: &lt;well known address in the network&gt; </code></p></details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Fix Postgres database creation</summary><hr/><p>Starting with efm 5.0, a new property 'backup.wal' has been added. This change adds the new property if the version of efm is 5 or higher.</p></details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Bump Python dependency to version 3.12</summary><hr/><p>We were depending on Python 3.9, however, this release doesn't receive more updates and it's currently and finally discountinued.</p></details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Wait for protocol version update during PGD upgrade</summary><hr/><p>During upgrade from PGD3 to PGD5, the protocol version uodate may take some time. The pgd5 specific config changes fail if they are attempted before protocl version change. Hence adding this wait to avoid such failures.</p></details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Use SLES15SP6 as the standard SLES for nodes</summary><hr/><p>When SLES is requested at configure-time, TPA will now install SLES15SP6. The docker and EC2 images are now SP6, and the systemd-sysvcompat package is installed on SLES, so that local boot-time scripts continue to work.</p></details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Update <code>&lt;clustername&gt;.nodes</code> when new nodes are added to an existing EFM cluster</summary><hr/><p>When a new EFM node is added to <code>config.yml</code>, it is not listed in the <code>Allowed node host list</code> on the existing EFM nodes in the cluster. The task which executes <code>efm upgrade-conf</code> and propagates the changes from <code>/raw/&lt;clustername&gt;.properties</code> and <code>/raw/&lt;clustername&gt;.nodes</code> is now run when EITHER of these files are changed. This results in the new EFM node being written to the <code>&lt;clustername&gt;.nodes</code> file and <code>efm cluster-status</code> including it in the <code>Allowed node host list</code>.</p></details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Add <code>PGPORT</code> to the postgres user's <code>.bashrc</code> file installed by TPA</summary><hr/><p>The <code>PGPORT</code> environment variable has been exported as part of the postgres user's <code>.bashrc</code> file. It defaults to the port value used by the selected <code>postgres_flavour</code>, or <code>postgres_port</code> if specified in the config file.</p></details></td><td></td></tr>

## Bug Fixes

<table class="table w-100"><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th width="10%">Addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><details><summary>Fix shared_preload_libraries on Patroni clusters</summary><hr/><p>Entries in shared_preload libraries are now treated correctly by Patroni. This fixes a bug whereby adding the pglogical extension to a Patroni cluster via config.yml would fail.</p></details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Fix a bug whereby deploys would fail for distributions which have no additional repository setup commands for extensions</summary><hr/><p>When <code>postgis</code> is added to <code>extra_postgres_extensions</code> or the <code>extensions</code> list of a database in <code>postgres_databases</code>, deploys fail for Debian, SLES and Ubuntu because their list of <code>repository_setup_commands</code> is empty (only RHEL has an additional command to run<code>crb enable</code>). This empty list of commands looped over and passed to the <code>command</code> module, which fails with <code>no command given</code>, resulting in deployment failure. As a result, the <code>Automatically run additional repository setup commands for recognized extensions</code> task is now skipped if the distribution has no additional commands to run.</p></details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Respect <code>repmgr_use_slots</code> when creating slots</summary><hr/><p>Fixed an issue whereby TPA attempted to create replication slots even when <code>repmgr_use_slot</code> was set to 0</p></details></td><td>41776</td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Fix Postgres database creation</summary><hr/><p>In order to remove modules (<code>CREATE EXTENSION</code> is not run, e.g. <code>pg_failover_slots</code>) from the list of <code>extensions</code> specified for named databases under <code>postgres_databases</code>, the entire hash was modified. This introduced a bug, since a new hash was created that ONLY contained the database <code>name</code> and list of <code>extensions</code>, ignoring all other configuration settings for the database (<code>owner</code>, <code>template</code>, <code>encoding</code> etc). This resulted in databases being created with the default parameters rather than as configured. To fix this, the modules are removed from the list of extensions and the resulting list is passed to the task which runs CREATE EXTENSION.</p></details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Set <code>bdr_client_dsn_attributes</code> as the default for <code>pgd_proxy_dsn_attributes</code> and <code>pgd_cli_dsn_attributes</code></summary><hr/><p>Because pgd-proxy and pgd-cli are written in Go and use a Go driver, they do not support the full set of parameter keywords supported by libpq. In the case a cluster has installed pgd-proxy and/or pgd-cli and has configured <code>bdr_client_dsn_attributes</code> with parameters that the Go driver does <em>not</em> support, two new configuration variables must be included: <code>pgd_proxy_dsn_attributes</code> and <code>pgd_cli_dsn_attributes</code>, containing only additional DSN parameters that the Go driver supports. Conversely, if pgd-proxy and pgd-cli are installed and <code>bdr_client_dsn_attributes</code> does not include any Go-incompatible parameters, the connection strings for these tools will be configured with the attributes in <code>bdr_client_dsn_attributes</code>. This amends unexpected behavior where the <code>pgd_proxy_dsn_attributes</code> and <code>pgd_cli_dsn_attributes</code> were defaulting to empty strings when not defined, even though the user was expecting the parameters in <code>bdr_client_dsn_attributes</code> to be used.</p></details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Use standard form of home directory for etcd</summary><hr/><p>When creating the etcd user, TPA now refers to its home directory without a trailing slash, matching the usage of other tools like 'useradd'.</p></details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Add ssh port flag to Barman configuration</summary><hr/><p>The Barman configuration is now able to use custom ssh port set via the <code>cluster_ssh_port</code> in <code>config.yml</code>, which defaults to 22 if it is not set. The <code>-p</code>/<code>--port</code> flags are now included in the <code>ssh</code> command in <code>barman.d.conf</code> and <code>barman-wal-restore</code>/`barman-wal-archive' commands respectively.</p></details></td><td></td></tr>
