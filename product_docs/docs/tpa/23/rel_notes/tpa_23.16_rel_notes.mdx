title: Trusted Postgres Architect 23.16 release notes 
navTitle: "Version 23.16"
---


New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Trusted Postgres Architect 23.16 include the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
|Change | The default PGD-Always-ON cluster is now one location with an associated subgroup containing two data nodes and one witness node. |
|Change | TPA now deploys pgd-proxy on all data nodes by default. |
|Enhancement | Added a new option, `--add-proxy-nodes-per-location N`, which creates separate proxy instances |
|Enhancement | TPA now adds a witness node automatically if `--data_nodes_per_location` is even and prints a warning if you specify a cluster with only two locations|
|Change | The parameter `--add-witness-only-location`  has been renamed to `--witness-only-location` because we're NOT adding a location, but designating an already-named (in `--location-names`) location as witness-only. |
|Change | You must now specify Postgres flavour and version explicitly at `tpaexec configure` time |
|Enhancement | Added new CLI abbreviations for Postgres flavour and version, for example `--postgresql 14` or `--edbpge 15` |
|Enhancement | Improved handling and documentation of the various supported EDB software repositories |
|Change | TPA no longer includes the PGDG repository by default for PGD-Always-ON clusters |
|Bug fix | Fixed an issue whereby EDB Failover Manager was not selected as the failover manager for EPAS by default |
|Bug fix | Fixed an issue whereby pglogical was unnecessarily installed in the M1 architecture |
