title: tpaexec reconfigure
originalFilePath: tpaexec-reconfigure.md

---

The `tpaexec reconfigure` command reads config.yml and generates a
revised version of it that changes the cluster from one architecture to
another. [tpaexec upgrade](../tpaexec-upgrade/) may then be invoked to
make the required changes on the instances that make up the cluster.

## Arguments

As with other tpaexec commands, the cluster directory must always be
given.

The following arguments control the contents of the new config.yml:

-   `--architecture <architecture>`(required)
    The new architecture for the cluster. At present the only supported
    architecture is `PGD-Always-ON`

-   `--pgd-proxy-routing <global|local>`(required)
    How PGD-Proxy is to route connections. See
    [the PGD-Always-ON documentation](../architecture-PGD-Always-ON/) for more
    information about the meaning of this argument.

-   `--edb-repositories <repositories>`(optional)
    A space-separated list of EDB package repositories. It is usually
    unnecessary to specify this; `tpaexec configure` will choose a suitable
    repository based on the postgres flavour in use in the cluster.

The following options control the form of the output:

-   `--describe`
    Shows a description of what would be changed, without changing
    anything.

-   `--check`
    Validates the changes that would be made and shows any errors any
    errors or warnings that result from validation, without changing
    anything.

-   `--output <filename>`
    Writes the output to a file other than config.yml.

## Sample invocation

```
$ tpaexec reconfigure ~/clusters/speedy\
  --architecture PGD-Always-ON\
  --pgd-proxy-routing local
```
