description: Integrating TPA deployments with EDB Postgres AI using the PGAI agent

originalFilePath: beacon-agent.md

!!!Note

TPA currently only supports using the PGAI Agent to integrate clusters with EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service. Using the agent to integrate with EDB Postgres AI Hybrid Manager, or for usage reporting, will be supported in a future release of TPA.
!!!

TPA installs and configures the PGAI agent (packaged as `beacon-agent`) on nodes which have
the role `beacon-agent` in `config.yml`. If `--enable-beacon-agent` is
passed to `tpaexec configure`, then all of the postgres nodes in the
cluster have this role.

## PGAI agent package version

By default, TPA installs the latest available version of `beacon-agent`.

The version of the `beacon-agent` package that is installed can be specified 
by including `beacon_agent_package_version: xxx` under the `cluster_vars` 
section of the `config.yml` file.

```yaml
cluster_vars:
    …
    beacon_agent_package_version: '1.56.2-1'
    …
```

You may use any version specifier that apt or yum would accept.

If your version does not match, try appending a `*` wildcard. This
is often necessary when the package version has an epoch qualifier
like `2:...`.

## PGAI agent configuration

The PGAI agent configuration contains two parameters which must be set
per-cluster, the access key and the project id.

The access key is kept encrypted in the cluster directory and can be
set or read using tpa's `store-password` and `show-password` commands:

```shell
tpaexec store-password . beacon_agent_access_key
```

```output
Password:
```

```shell
tpaexec show-password . beacon_agent_access_key
```

If the environment variable BEACON_AGENT_ACCESS_KEY is set when `tpaexec
provision` is run, the access key is set from its value.

The project id is stored in `config.yml` under the
`beacon_agent_project_id` key in `cluster_vars`. If the
`--beacon_agent_project_id` argument is passed to `tpaexec configure`
then its value is written to `config.yml` appropriately.

## Installing the PGAI agent

TPA installs the PGAI agent from EDB's repositories and creates an
operating system user called `beacon` and a database user called
`beacon`. A configuration file for the agent is written to
`.beacon/beacon_agent.yaml` in the beacon user's home directory.

## Running the PGAI agent

TPA installs a systemd service unit file to start the agent at
boot-time, running as the beacon user.
