This document explains how to use TPA from a copy of the source code
repository.

!!! Note

      EDB customers must [install TPA from packages](INSTALL/) in
      order to receive EDB support for the software.

To run TPA from source, you must install all of the dependencies
(e.g., Python 3.12+) that the packages would handle for you, or download
the source and [run TPA in a Docker container](reference/INSTALL-docker/).
(Either way will work fine on Linux and macOS.)

## Quickstart

First, you must install the various dependencies Python 3, Python
venv, git, openvpn and patch. Installing from EDB repositories
would install these automatically along with the TPA
packages.

Before you install TPA, you must install the required packages:

-   **Debian/Ubuntu** <br/> `sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip python3-venv git openvpn patch`
-   **Redhat, Rocky or AlmaLinux (RHEL7)** <br/> `sudo yum install python3 python3-pip epel-release git openvpn patch`
-   **Redhat, Rocky or AlmaLinux (RHEL8)** <br/>`sudo yum install python36 python3-pip epel-release git openvpn patch`
-   **Redhat, Rocky or AlmaLinux (RHEL9???????)** <br/>`sudo yum install python36 python3-pip epel-release git openvpn patch`

## Clone and setup

With prerequisites installed, you can now clone the repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/enterprisedb/tpa.git ~/tpa
```

This creates a `tpa` directory in your home directory.

If you prefer to checkout with ssh use:

```shell
git clone ssh://git@github.com/EnterpriseDB/tpa.git ~/tpa
```

Add the bin directory, found within in your newly created clone, to your path with:

```shell
export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/tpa/bin
```

Add this line to your `.bashrc` file (or other profile file for your preferred shell).

You can now create a working tpa environment by running:

```shell
tpaexec setup
```

This will create the Python virtual environment that TPA will use in future. All needed packages are installed in this environment. To test this configured correctly, run the following:

```shell
tpaexec selftest
```

You now have tpaexec installed.

## Dependencies

### Python 3.12+

TPA requires Python 3.12 or later, available on most
modern distributions. If you don't have it, you can use
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to install any version of Python
you like without affecting the system packages.

```shell
# First, install pyenv and activate it in ~/.bashrc
# See https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation
# (e.g., `brew install pyenv` on MacOS X)

pyenv install 3.12.0
```

```output
Downloading Python-3.12.0.tar.xz...
-> https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.12.0/Python-3.12.0.tar.xz
Installing Python-3.12.0...
Installed Python-3.12.0 to /home/ams/.pyenv/versions/3.12.0
```

```shell
pyenv local 3.12.0
pyenv version
```

```output
3.12.0 (set by /home/ams/pyenv/.python-version)
```

```shell
pyenv which python3
```

```output
/home/ams/.pyenv/versions/3.12.0/bin/python3
```

```shell
python3 --version
```

```output
3.12.0
```

If you were not already using pyenv, please remember to add `pyenv` to
your PATH in .bashrc and call `eval "$(pyenv init -)"` as described in
the [pyenv documentation](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation).

### Virtual environment options

By default, `tpaexec setup` will use the builtin Python 3 `-m venv`
to create a venv under `$TPA_DIR/tpa-venv`, and activate it
automatically whenever `tpaexec` is invoked.

You can run `tpaexec setup --venv /other/location` to specify a
different location for the new venv.

We strongly suggest sticking to the default venv location. If you use a
different location, you must also set the environment variable TPA_VENV
to its location, for example by adding the following line to your
.bashrc (or other shell startup scripts):

```shell
export TPA_VENV="/other/location"
```
