This section discusses currently known issues in BDR4.

## Data Consistency

Please remember to read about [Conflicts](conflicts) to understand
the implications of the asynchronous operation mode in terms of data
consistency.

## List of Issues

In the remaining part of this section we list a number of known issues
that are tracked in BDR's ticketing system, each marked with an
unique identifier.

-   If the resolver for the `update_origin_change` conflict
    is set to `skip`, and `synchronous_commit=remote_apply` is used, and
    concurrent updates of the same row are repeatedly applied on two
    different nodes, then one of the update statements might hang due
    to a deadlock with the BDR writer.  As mentioned in the
    [Conflicts](conflicts) chapter, `skip` is not the default
    resolver for the `update_origin_change` conflict, and this
    combination is not intended to be used in production: it discards
    one of the two conflicting updates based on the order of arrival
    on that node, which is likely to cause a divergent cluster.
    In the rare situation that you do choose to use the `skip`
    conflict resolver, please note the issue with the use of the
    `remote_apply` mode.

-   A `galloc` sequence might skip some chunks if the
    sequence is created in a rolled back transaction and then created
    again with the same name, or if it is created and dropped when DDL
    replication is not active and then it is created again when DDL
    replication is active.
    The impact of the problem is mild, because the sequence
    guarantees are not violated; the sequence will only skip some
    initial chunks. Also, as a workaround the user can specify the
    starting value for the sequence as an argument to the
    `bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind()` function.

-   Upgrades from BDR 3.7 are only supported by adding new nodes,
    and **not** through in-place upgrade of the same data directory.
    This is planned to be resolved in a future 4.0 minor release.

-   The `bdr.monitor_local_replslots()` function may return CRITICAL result
    saying "There is at least 1 BDR replication slot which is missing" even if
    all slots exists in presence of logical standbys or subscribe-only node
    groups.

-   Decoding Worker feature does not work with CAMO/EAGER

-   Decoding Worker works only with the default replication sets
