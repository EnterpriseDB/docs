## Data consistency

Read [Conflicts](conflicts) to understand
the implications of the asynchronous operation mode in terms of data
consistency.

## List of issues

These known issues are tracked in BDR's
ticketing system and are expected to be resolved in a future
release.

-   If the resolver for the `update_origin_change` conflict
    is set to `skip`, `synchronous_commit=remote_apply` is used, and
    concurrent updates of the same row are repeatedly applied on two
    different nodes, then one of the update statements might hang due
    to a deadlock with the BDR writer. As mentioned in
    [Conflicts](conflicts), `skip` isn't the default
    resolver for the `update_origin_change` conflict, and this
    combination isn't intended to be used in production. It discards
    one of the two conflicting updates based on the order of arrival
    on that node, which is likely to cause a divergent cluster.
    In the rare situation that you do choose to use the `skip`
    conflict resolver,  note the issue with the use of the
    `remote_apply` mode.

-   The Decoding Worker feature doesn't work with CAMO/EAGER/Group Commit.
    Installations using CAMO/Eager/Group Commit must keep `enable_wal_decoder`
    disabled.

-   Decoding Worker works only with the default replication sets.

-   Lag control doesn't adjust commit delay in any way on a fully
    isolated node, that is, in case all other nodes are unreachable or not
    operational. As soon as at least one node is connected, replication
    lag control picks up its work and adjusts the BDR commit delay
    again.

-   For time-based lag control, BDR currently uses the lag time (measured
    by commit timestamps) rather than the estimated catchup time that's
    based on historic apply rate.

-   Changing the CAMO partners in a CAMO pair isn't currently possible.
    It's possible only to add or remove a pair.
    Adding or removing a pair doesn't need a restart of Postgres or even a
    reload of the configuration.

-   Group Commit can't be combined with [CAMO](camo) or [Eager All Node
    replication](eager). Eager Replication currently works only by using the
    "global" BDR commit scope.

-   Neither Eager replication nor Group Commit support
   `synchronous_replication_availability = 'async'`.

-   Group Commit doesn't support a timeout of the
    commit after `bdr.global_commit_timeout`.

-   Transactions using Eager Replication can't yet execute DDL,
    nor do they support explicit two-phase commit.
    The TRUNCATE command is allowed.

-   Not all DDL can be run when either CAMO or Group Commit is used.

-   Parallel apply isn't currently supported in combination with Group
    Commit. Make sure to disable it when using Group Commit
    either by setting `num_writers` to 1 for the node group (using
    [`bdr.alter_node_group_config`](nodes#bdralter_node_group_config)) or
    via the GUC `bdr.writers_per_subscription` (see
    [Configuration of generic replication](configuration#generic-replication)).

-   There currently is no protection against altering or removing a commit
    scope. Running transactions in a commit scope that is concurrently
    being altered or removed can lead to the transaction blocking or
    replication stalling completely due to an error on the downstream node
    attempting to apply the transaction. Ensure that any transactions
    using a specific commit scope have finished before altering or removing it.

## List of limitations

This is a (non-comprehensive) list of limitations that are
expected and are by design. They are not expected to be resolved in the
future.

-   Replacing a node with its physical standby doesn't work for nodes that
    use CAMO/Eager/Group Commit. Combining physical standbys and BDR in
    general isn't recommended, even if otherwise possible.

-   A `galloc` sequence might skip some chunks if the
    sequence is created in a rolled back transaction and then created
    again with the same name. This can also occur if it is created and dropped when DDL
    replication isn't active and then it is created again when DDL
    replication is active.
    The impact of the problem is mild, because the sequence
    guarantees aren't violated. The sequence skips only some
    initial chunks. Also, as a workaround you can specify the
    starting value for the sequence as an argument to the
    `bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind()` function.

-   Legacy BDR synchronous replication uses a mechanism for transaction
    confirmation different from the one used by CAMO, Eager, and Group Commit.
    The two are not compatible and must not be used together. Therefore, nodes
    that appear in `synchronous_standby_names` must not be part of CAMO, Eager,
    or Group Commit configuration. Using synchronous replication to other nodes,
    including both logical and physical standby is possible.
