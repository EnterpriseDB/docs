title: Transaction streaming


---

With logical replication, transactions are decoded concurrently on the publisher
but are not sent to subscribers until the transaction is committed. If the
changes exceed `logical_decoding_work_mem` (PostgreSQL 13 and later), they are
spilled to disk. This means that particularly with large transactions, there
will be some delay before they reach subscribers, and may entail additional I/O
on the publisher.

Beginning with PostgreSQL 14, transactions can optionally be decoded and sent to
subscribers *before* they are committed on the publisher. The subscribers save
the incoming changes to a staging file (or set of files) and apply them when
the transaction commits (or discard them if the transaction aborts). This makes
it possible to apply transactions on on subscribers as soon as the transaction
commits.

## BDR enhancements

PostgreSQL's built-in transaction streaming, as described above, has the following
limitations:

-   while it's no longer necessary to spill changes to disk on the publisher, changes must
    be written to disk on each subscriber
-   if the transaction aborts, the work (changes received by each subscriber
    and the associated storage I/O) will have been wasted

However, from version 3.7, BDR supports Parallel Apply, enabling multiple writer
processes on each subscriber, which is leveraged to provide the following enhancements:

-   decoded transactions can be streamed directly to a writer on the subscriber
-   decoded transactions do not need to be stored on-disk on subscribers
-   no need to wait for the transaction to commit before starting to apply the
    transaction on the subscriber

### Caveats

-   parallel apply must be enabled
-   if the workload consists of many small and conflicting transactions, this can lead to
    frequent deadlocks between writers

!!! Note
    Direct streaming to writer is still an experimental feature and must
    be used with caution. For specifically, it may not work well with
    conflict resolutions since the commit timestamp of the streaming may not
    be available (as the transaction may not have yet committed on the
    origin).

## Configuration

Transaction streaming is configured in two locations:

-   at node level, via the GUC [bdr.default_streaming_mode](configuration#transaction-streaming)
-   at group level, via the function [bdr.alter_node_group_config()](nodes#bdralter_node_group_config)

### Node configuration using bdr.default_streaming_mode

Permitted values are:

-   `off`
-   `writer`
-   `file`
-   `auto`

Default value is `auto`.

Note that to become effective, a change to this setting requires a restart of the
pglogical receiver process for each subscription, which can be achieved with a server
restart.

If `bdr.default_streaming_mode` is set any other value than `off`, the
subscriber will request transaction streaming from the publisher. How this will
be provided may also depend on the group configuration setting; see section XXX
below for details.

### Group configuration using bdr.alter_node_group_config()

The parameter `streaming_mode` in function [bdr.alter_node_group_config()](nodes#bdralter_node_group_config)
can be used to set the group transaction streaming configuration.

Permitted values are:

-   `off`
-   `writer`
-   `file`
-   `auto`
-   `default`

Default value is `default`.

The value of the current setting is contained in the column `node_group_streaming_mode`
from the view [bdr.node_group](catalogs#bdrnode_group). The value returned is
a single char type and the possible values are `D` (`default`), `W` (`writer`),
`F` (`file`), `A` (`auto`) and `O` (`off`).

### Configuration setting effects

Transaction streaming is controlled at subscriber level by the GUC
`bdr.default_streaming_mode`. Unless set to `off` (which disables transaction
streaming), the subscriber will request transaction streaming.

If the publisher is capable of providing transaction streaming, it wil
stream transactions whenever the transaction size exceeds the threshold set in
`logical_decoding_work_mem`. The publisher usually has no control over whether
the transactions will be streamed to a file or to a writer. Except for some
situations (such as COPY), it might hint the subscriber to stream the
transaction to a writer (if possible).

The subscriber can stream transactions received from the publisher to
either a writer or a file. The decision is based on several factors:

-   if parallel apply is off (`num_writers` = 1), then it will be streamed to a file
    (writer 0 is always reserved for non-streamed transactions)
-   if parallel apply is on, but all writers are already busy handling streamed
    transactions, then the new transaction will be streamed to a file. See
    [bdr.writers]\(monitoring.md#Monitoring BDR Writers) to check BDR
    writer status.

If streaming to a writer is possible (i.e. a free writer is available), then the
decision whether to stream the transaction to a writer or a file is based upon
the combination of group and node settings as per the following table:

| Group   | Node   | Streamed to |
| ------- | ------ | ----------- |
| off     | (any)  | (none)      |
| (any)   | off    | (none)      |
| writer  | file   | file        |
| file    | writer | file        |
| default | writer | writer      |
| default | file   | file        |
| default | auto   | writer      |
| auto    | (any)  | writer      |

Note that if the group configuration is set to `auto`, *or* the group
configuration is `default` and the node configuration is `auto`,
then the transaction is streamed to a writer if and only if the
publisher has hinted that this should be done.

Currently the publisher will hint for the subscriber to stream to writer
for the following transaction types, which are known to be conflict free
and can be safely handled by the writer in any case:

-   `COPY`
-   `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`

## Monitoring

Usage of transaction streaming can be monitored via the [bdr.stat_subscription](catalogs#bdrstat_subscription)
function on the subscriber node.

-   `nstream_writer` - number of transactions streamed to a writer
-   `nstream_file` - number of transactions streamed to file
-   `nstream_commit` - number of committed streamed transactions
-   `nstream_abort` - number of aborted streamed transactions
-   `nstream_start` - number of streamed transactions which were started
-   `nstream_stop` -  number of streamed transactions which were fully received
