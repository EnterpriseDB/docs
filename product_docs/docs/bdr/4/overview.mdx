BDR provides loosely coupled, multi-master logical replication
using a mesh topology. This means that you can write to any server and the
changes are sent directly, row-by-row, to all the
other servers that are part of the same BDR group.

By default, BDR uses asynchronous replication, applying changes on
the peer nodes only after the local commit. An optional
[Eager All-Node Replication](eager) feature allows for committing
on all nodes using consensus.

## Basic architecture

### Multiple groups

A BDR node is a member of at least one *node group*, and in the most
basic architecture there is a single node group for the whole BDR
cluster.

### Multiple masters

Each node (database) participating in a BDR group both receives
changes from other members and can be written to directly by the user.

This is distinct from hot or warm standby, where only one master
server accepts writes, and all the other nodes are standbys that
replicate either from the master or from another standby.

You don't have to write to all the masters all of the time. 
A frequent configuration directs writes mostly to just one master.

### Asynchronous, by default

Changes made on one BDR node aren't replicated to other nodes until
they're committed locally. As a result, the data isn't exactly the
same on all nodes at any given time. Some nodes have data that
hasn't yet arrived at other nodes. PostgreSQL's block-based replication
solutions default to asynchronous replication as well. In BDR,
because there are multiple masters and, as a result, multiple data streams,
data on different nodes might differ even when
`synchronous_commit` and `synchronous_standby_names` are used.

### Mesh topology

BDR is structured around a mesh network where every node connects to every
other node and all nodes exchange data directly with each other. There's no
forwarding of data in BDR except in special circumstances such as adding and removing nodes.
Data can arrive from outside the BDR cluster or
be sent onwards using native PostgreSQL logical replication.

### Logical replication

Logical replication is a method of replicating data rows and their changes
based on their replication identity (usually a primary key).
We use the term *logical* in contrast to *physical* replication, which uses
exact block addresses and byte-by-byte replication. Index changes aren't
replicated, thereby avoiding write amplification and reducing bandwidth.

Logical replication starts by copying a snapshot of the data from the
source node. Once that is done, later commits are sent to other nodes as
they occur in real time. Changes are replicated without re-executing SQL,
so the exact data written is replicated quickly and accurately.

Nodes apply data in the order in which commits were made on the source node,
ensuring transactional consistency is guaranteed for the changes from
any single node. Changes from different nodes are applied independently of
other nodes to ensure the rapid replication of changes.

Replicated data is sent in binary form, when it's safe to do so.

### High availability

Each master node can be protected by one or more standby nodes, so any node
that goes down can be quickly replaced and continue. Each standby node can
be either a logical or a physical standby node.

Replication continues between currently connected nodes even if one or more
nodes are currently unavailable. When the node recovers, replication
can restart from where it left off without missing any changes.

Nodes can run different release levels, negotiating the required protocols
to communicate. As a result, BDR clusters can use rolling upgrades, even
for major versions of database software.

DDL is replicated across nodes by default. DDL execution can
be user controlled to allow rolling application upgrades, if desired.

### Limits

BDR can run hundreds of nodes on good-enough hardware and network. However,
for mesh-based deployments, we generally don't recommend running more than
32 nodes in one cluster.
Each master node can be protected by multiple physical or logical standby nodes.
There's no specific limit on the number of standby nodes,
but typical usage is to have 2&ndash;3 standbys per master. Standby nodes don't
add connections to the mesh network, so they aren't included in the
32-node recommendation.

BDR currently has a hard limit of no more than 1000 active nodes, as this is the
current maximum Raft connections allowed.

BDR places a limit that at most 10 databases in any one PostgreSQL instance
can be BDR nodes across different BDR node groups. However, BDR works best if
you use only one BDR database per PostgreSQL instance.

The minimum recommended number of nodes in a BDR cluster is three because with
two nodes the consensus stops working if one of the node stops working.

## Architectural options and performance

### Characterizing BDR performance

BDR can be configured in a number of different architectures, each of which has
different performance and scalability characteristics.

The group is the basic building block of a BDR group consisting of 2+ nodes
(servers). In a group, each node is in a different availability zone, with dedicated router
and backup, giving immediate switchover and high availability. Each group has a
dedicated replication set defined on it. If the group loses a node, you can easily
repair or replace it by copying an existing node from the group.

Adding more master nodes to a BDR group doesn't result in significant write
throughput increase when most tables are replicated because BDR has to replay
all the writes on all nodes. Because BDR writes are in general more effective
than writes coming from Postgres clients by way of SQL, some performance increase
can be achieved. Read throughput generally scales linearly with the number of
nodes.

The following architectures are available:

-   Multi-master/single group
-   BDR AlwaysOn

The simplest architecture is to have just one group.

### BDR multi-master in one group

By default, BDR keeps one copy of each table on each node in the group, and any
changes propagate to all nodes in the group.

Since copies of data are everywhere, SELECTs need only ever access the local node.
On a read-only cluster, performance on any one node isn't affected by the
number of nodes. Thus, adding nodes increases linearly the total possible SELECT
throughput.

If an INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE (DML) is performed locally, then the changes
propagate to all nodes in the group. The overhead of DML apply is less than the
original execution, so if you run a pure write workload on multiple nodes
concurrently, a multi-node cluster can handle more TPS than a single node.

Conflict handling has a cost that acts to reduce the throughput. The throughput
then depends on how much contention the application displays in practice.
Applications with very low contention perform better than a single node.
Applications with high contention can perform worse than a single node.
These results are consistent with any multi-master technology. They aren't particular to BDR.

Eager Replication can avoid conflicts but is inherently more expensive.

Changes are sent concurrently to all nodes so that the replication lag is minimized.
Adding more nodes means using more CPU for replication, so peak TPS reduces
slightly as each node is added.

If the workload tries to use all CPU resources, then this resource constrains
replication, which can then affect the replication lag.

### BDR AlwaysOn

The AlwaysOn architecture is built from two groups in two separate regions. Each group
provides HA and IS, but together they also provide disaster recovery (DR), so we refer
to this architecture as AlwaysOn with very high availability.

Tables are created across both groups, so any change goes to all nodes, not just to
nodes in the local group.

One node is the target for the main application. All other nodes are described as
shadow nodes (or "read-write replica"), waiting to take over when needed. If a node
loses contact, we switch immediately to a shadow node to continue processing. If a
group fails, we can switch to the other group. Scalability isn't the goal of this
architecture.

Since we write mainly to only one node, the possibility of contention between is
reduced to almost zero. As a result, performance impact is much reduced.

CAMO is Eager Replication in the local group, lazy with regard to other groups.

Secondary applications might execute against the shadow nodes, although these are
reduced or interrupted if the main application begins using that node.

In the future, one node will be elected as the main replicator to other groups, limiting CPU
overhead of replication as the cluster grows and minimizing the bandwidth to other groups.

## Deployment

BDR is intended to be deployed in one of a small number of known-good configurations,
using either TPAexec or a configuration management approach
and deployment architecture approved by Technical Support.

Manual deployment isn't recommended and might not be supported.

Refer to the `TPAexec Architecture User Manual` for your architecture.

Log messages and documentation are currently available only in English.

## Clocks and timezones

BDR is designed to operate with nodes in multiple timezones, allowing a
truly worldwide database cluster. Individual servers don't need to be configured
with matching timezones, although we do recommend using `log_timezone = UTC` to
ensure the human-readable server log is more accessible and comparable.

Synchronize server clocks using NTP or other solutions.

Clock synchronization isn't critical to performance, as it is with some
other solutions. Clock skew can impact origin conflict detection, although
BDR provides controls to report and manage any skew that exists. BDR also
provides row-version conflict detection, as described in [Conflict detection](conflicts).
