title: Column-level conflict detection


---

By default, conflicts are resolved at row level. That is, when changes
from two nodes conflict, we pick either the local or remote tuple and
discard the other one. For example, we might compare commit timestamps for
the two conflicting changes and keep the newer one. This ensures that all
nodes converge to the same result and establishes commit-order-like
semantics on the whole cluster.

However, in some cases it might be appropriate to resolve conflicts at
the column level rather than the row level.

Consider a simple example, where we have a table t with two integer
columns a and b and a single row `(1,1)`. Assume that on one node
we execute:

```sql
UPDATE t SET a = 100
```

On another node we concurrently (before receiving the preceding
`UPDATE`) execute:

```sql
UPDATE t SET b = 100
```

This results in an `UPDATE-UPDATE` conflict. With the `update_if_newer`
conflict resolution, we compare the commit timestamps and keep the new
row version. Assuming the second node committed last, we end up with
`(1,100)`, effectively discarding the change to column a.

For many use cases, this is the desired and expected behavior, but for
some this might be an issue. Consider, for example, a multi-node cluster
where each part of the application is connected to a different node,
updating a dedicated subset of columns in a shared table. In that case,
the different components might step on each other's toes, overwriting
their changes.

For such use cases, it might be more appropriate to resolve conflicts on
a given table at the column level. To achieve that, BDR tracks
the timestamp of the last change for each column separately and uses that
to pick the most recent value (essentially `update_if_newer`).

Applied to the previous example, we'll end up with `(100,100)` on both
nodes, despite neither of the nodes ever seeing such a row.

When thinking about column-level conflict resolution, it can be useful
to see tables as vertically partitioned, so that each update affects
data in only one slice. This approach eliminates conflicts between changes to
different subsets of columns. In fact, vertical partitioning can even
be a practical alternative to column-level conflict resolution.

Column-level conflict resolution requires the table to have 
`REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`. The `bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection` function does check
that and fails with an error otherwise.

## Enabling and disabling column-level conflict resolution

The column-level conflict resolution is managed by the
[bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection()](conflicts#bdralter_table_conflict_detection)
function.

### Example

To see how the `bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection()` is used, consider
this example that creates a trivial table `test_table` and then enables
column-level conflict resolution on it:

```sql
db=# CREATE TABLE my_app.test_table (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, val INT);
CREATE TABLE

db=# ALTER TABLE my_app.test_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
ALTER TABLE

db=# SELECT bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection(
db(# 'my_app.test_table'::regclass, 'column_modify_timestamp', 'cts');
 alter_table_conflict_detection
--------------------------------
 t

db=# \d my_app.test_table
```

The function adds a new `cts` column (as specified in
the function call), but it also created two triggers (`BEFORE INSERT`
and `BEFORE UPDATE`) that are responsible for maintaining timestamps
in the new column before each change.

Also, the new column specifies `NOT NULL`
with a default value, which means that `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`
doesn't perform a table rewrite.

!!! Note 
    We discourage using columns with the `bdr.column_timestamps` data type
    for other purposes as it can have negative effects. 
    For example, it switches the table to column-level conflict resolution, which doesn't
    work correctly without the triggers.

### Listing table with column-level conflict resolution

You can list tables having column-level conflict resolution enabled
with the following query. This query detects the presence of a column of
type `bdr.column_timestamp`.

```sql
SELECT nc.nspname, c.relname
FROM pg_attribute a
JOIN (pg_class c JOIN pg_namespace nc ON c.relnamespace = nc.oid)
  ON a.attrelid = c.oid
JOIN (pg_type t  JOIN pg_namespace nt ON t.typnamespace = nt.oid)
  ON a.atttypid = t.oid
WHERE NOT pg_is_other_temp_schema(nc.oid)
  AND nt.nspname = 'bdr'
  AND t.typname = 'column_timestamps'
  AND NOT a.attisdropped
  AND c.relkind IN ('r', 'v', 'f', 'p');
```

### bdr.column_timestamps_create

This function creates column-level conflict resolution. It's called within
`column_timestamp_enable`.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.column_timestamps_create(p_source cstring, p_timestamp timestampstz)
```

#### Parameters

-   `p_source` &mdash; The two options are `current` or `commit`.
-   `p_timestamp` &mdash; Timestamp depends on the source chosen. If `commit`,
    then `TIMESTAMP_SOURCE_COMMIT`. If `current`, then `TIMESTAMP_SOURCE_CURRENT`.

## DDL locking

When enabling or disabling column timestamps on a table, the code uses
DDL locking to ensure that there are no pending changes from before the
switch. This approach ensures we see only conflicts with timestamps in both
tuples or in neither of them. Otherwise, the code might unexpectedly see
timestamps in the local tuple and NULL in the remote one. It also
ensures that the changes are resolved the same way (column-level or
row-level) on all nodes.

## Current versus commit timestamp

An important decision is the timestamp to assign to modified columns.

By default, the timestamp assigned to modified columns is the current
timestamp, as if obtained from `clock_timestamp`. This is simple, and
for many cases it is perfectly correct (for example, when the conflicting rows
modify non-overlapping subsets of columns).

It can, however, have various unexpected effects:

-   The timestamp changes during statement execution, so if an `UPDATE`
    affects multiple rows, each gets a slightly different timestamp.
    This means that the effects of concurrent changes might get "mixed" in various
    ways (depending on how exactly the changes performed on different
    nodes interleave).

-   The timestamp is unrelated to the commit timestamp, and using it to
    resolve conflicts means that the result isn't equivalent to the commit order,
    which means it likely can't be serialized.

!!! Note
    We might add statement and transaction timestamps in the future,
    which would address issues with mixing effects of concurrent statements or
    transactions. Still, neither of these options can ever produce results
    equivalent to commit order.

It's possible to also use the actual commit timestamp, although this
feature is currently considered experimental. To use the commit timestamp,
set the last parameter to `true` when enabling column-level conflict
resolution:

```sql
SELECT bdr.column_timestamps_enable('test_table'::regclass, 'cts', true);
```

You can disable it using `bdr.column_timestamps_disable`.

Commit timestamps currently have restrictions that are
explained in [Limitations](#limitations).

## Inspecting column timestamps

The column storing timestamps for modified columns is maintained
automatically by triggers. Don't modify it directly. It can
be useful to inspect the current timestamps value, for example, while
investigating how a conflict was resolved.

Three functions are useful for this purpose:

-   `bdr.column_timestamps_to_text(bdr.column_timestamps)`

    This function returns a human-readable representation of the timestamp mapping and
    is used when casting the value to `text`:

```sql
db=# select cts::text from test_table;
                                                 cts
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {source: current, default: 2018-09-23 19:24:52.118583+02, map: [2 : 2018-09-23 19:25:02.590677+02]}
(1 row)

```

-   `bdr.column_timestamps_to_jsonb(bdr.column_timestamps)`

    This function turns a JSONB representation of the timestamps mapping and is used
    when casting the value to `jsonb`:

```sql
db=# select jsonb_pretty(cts::jsonb) from test_table;
                   jsonb_pretty
---------------------------------------------------
 {                                                +
     "map": {                                     +
         "2": "2018-09-23T19:24:52.118583+02:00"  +
     },                                           +
     "source": "current",                         +
     "default": "2018-09-23T19:24:52.118583+02:00"+
 }
(1 row)
```

-   `bdr.column_timestamps_resolve(bdr.column_timestamps, xid)`

    This function updates the mapping with the commit timestamp for the attributes modified
    by the most recent transaction (if it already committed). This
    matters only when using the commit timestamp. For example, in this case, the last
    transaction updated the second attribute (with `attnum = 2`):

```sql
test=# select cts::jsonb from test_table;
                                                                  cts
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {"map": {"2": "2018-09-23T19:29:55.581823+02:00"}, "source": "commit", "default": "2018-09-23T19:29:55.581823+02:00", "modified": [2]}
(1 row)

db=# select bdr.column_timestamps_resolve(cts, xmin)::jsonb from test_table;
                                               column_timestamps_resolve
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {"map": {"2": "2018-09-23T19:29:55.581823+02:00"}, "source": "commit", "default": "2018-09-23T19:29:55.581823+02:00"}
(1 row)
```

## Handling column conflicts using CRDT data types

By default, column-level conflict resolution picks the value with
a higher timestamp and discards the other one. You can, however,
reconcile the conflict in different, more elaborate ways. For example, you can use 
CRDT types that allow merging the conflicting values without
discarding any information.

## Notes

-   The attributes modified by an `UPDATE` are determined by comparing the
    old and new row in a trigger. This means that if the attribute doesn't
    change a value, it isn't detected as modified even if it's
    explicitly set. For example, `UPDATE t SET a = a` doesn't mark `a` as
    modified for any row. Similarly, `UPDATE t SET a = 1` doesn't mark
    `a` as modified for rows that are already set to `1`.

-   For `INSERT` statements, we don't have any old row to compare the new
    one to, so we consider all attributes to be modified and assign them
    a new timestamp. This applies even for columns that weren't included
    in the `INSERT` statement and received default values. We can detect
    which attributes have a default value but can't know if
    it was included automatically or specified explicitly.

    This effectively means column-level conflict resolution doesn't work
    for `INSERT-INSERT` conflicts even if the `INSERT` statements specify
    different subsets of columns. The newer row has
    timestamps that are all newer than the older row.

-   By treating the columns independently, it's easy to violate constraints
    in a way that isn't possible when all changes happen on the same
    node. Consider, for example, a table like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (id INT PRIMARY KEY, a INT, b INT, CHECK (a > b));
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1, 1000, 1);
```

Assume one node does:

```sql
UPDATE t SET a = 100;
```

Another node concurrently does:

```sql
UPDATE t SET b = 500;
```

  Each of those updates is valid when executed on the initial row and
  so passes on each node. But when replicating to the other node,
  the resulting row violates the `CHECK (A > b)` constraint, and the
  replication stops until the issue is resolved manually.

-   The column storing timestamp mapping is managed automatically. Don't
    specify or override the value in your queries, as it can result in
    unpredictable effects. (We do ignore the value where possible anyway.)

-   The timestamp mapping is maintained by triggers, but the order in which
    triggers execute matters. So if you have custom triggers that modify
    tuples and are executed after the `pgl_clcd_` triggers, the modified
    columns aren't detected correctly.

-   When using regular timestamps to order changes/commits, it's possible
    that the conflicting changes have exactly the same timestamp (because
    two or more nodes happened to generate the same timestamp). This risk
    isn't unique to column-level conflict resolution, as it can happen
    even for regular row-level conflict resolution. We use node id as a
    tie-breaker in this situation (the higher node id wins), which ensures that the
    same changes are applied on all nodes.

-   It is possible that there is a clock skew between different nodes. While it
    can induce somewhat unexpected behavior (discarding seemingly newer
    changes because the timestamps are inverted), you can manage clock skew between nodes 
    using the parameters `bdr.maximum_clock_skew` and 
    `bdr.maximum_clock_skew_action`.

```sql
SELECT bdr.alter_node_group_config('group', ignore_redundant_updates := false);
```
