title: BDR (Bi-Directional Replication)
directoryDefaults:
  description: >-
    BDR (Bi-Directional Replication) is a ground-breaking multi-master
    replication capability for PostgreSQL clusters that has been in full
    production status since 2014.


---

## Overview

BDR is a PostgreSQL extension providing multi-master replication and data
distribution with advanced conflict management, data-loss protection, and
throughput up to 5X faster than native logical replication, and enables
distributed PostgreSQL clusters with high availability up to five 9s.

Detailed overview about how BDR works is described in the
[Architectural Overview](overview) chapter.

## Supported PostgreSQL database servers

BDR is compatible with PostgresSQL, EDB Postgres Extended and EDB Postgres
Advanced flavors of PostgresSQL database servers and can be deployed as a
standard PG extension. Full compatibility matrix is as follows.

| BDR Version | PostgreSQL | EDB Postgres Extended | EDB Postgres Advanced |
| ----------- | ---------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
| 4.0.2       | 14.2       | 14.2                  | 14.2                  |
| 4.0.2       | 13.6       | 13.6r1.1.8            | 13.6                  |
| 4.0.2       | 12.10      | 12.10r1.1.10          | 12.10                 |
| 3.7.15      | 13.6       | 13.6r1.1.8            | 13.6                  |
| 3.7.15      | 12.10      | 12.10r1.1.10          | 12.10                 |
| 3.7.15      | 11.15      | 11.15r2.1.10          | 11.15                 |

It is important to note that some key BDR features depend on certain core
capabilities being available within the targeted PostgresSQL database server.
Therefore, it is essential for the BDR customers to also adopt the PostgresSQL
database server flavor that is best suited to their business needs.  For
example, if having the BDR feature "Commit At Most Once (CAMO)" is mission
critical to a BDR customer’s use case, they should not adopt the community
PostgreSQL flavor for it does not have the core capability required to handle
CAMO. The full feature matrix compatibility can be found in
[Feature Compatibility](feature-matrix) appendix.

BDR offers close to native PostgreSQL compatibility. However, some access
patterns don't necessarily work as well in multi-node setup as they do on
single instance. There are also some limitations in what can be safely
replicated in multi-node setting. The chapter [Application Usage](appusage)
goes into detail on how BDR behaves from application development perspective.
