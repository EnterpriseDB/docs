title: Conflicts


---

BDR is an active/active or multi-master DBMS. If used asynchronously,
writes to the same or related rows from multiple different nodes can
result in data conflicts when using standard data types.

Conflicts aren't errors. In most cases, they are events that BDR can detect and resolve as they occur. 
Resolution depends on the
nature of the application and the meaning of the data, so it's important that
BDR provides the application a range of choices as to how to resolve conflicts.

By default, conflicts are resolved at row level. When changes from two
nodes conflict, BDR picks either the local or remote tuple and discards the other
one. For example, BDR might compare commit timestamps for the two conflicting
changes and keep the newer one. This approach ensures that all nodes converge to the
same result and establishes commit-order-like semantics on the whole cluster.

Conflict handling is configurable, as described in [Conflict resolution](#conflict-resolution).
Conflicts can be detected and handled differently for each table using
conflict triggers, described in [Stream triggers](striggers).

Column-level conflict detection and resolution is available with BDR,
described in [CLCD](column-level-conflicts).

If you want to avoid conflicts, you can use these features in BDR.

-   Conflict-free data types (CRDTs), described in [CRDT](crdt).
-   Eager Replication, described in [Eager Replication](eager).

By default, all conflicts are logged to `bdr.conflict_history`. If conflicts
are possible, then table owners must monitor for them and analyze how to
avoid them or make plans to handle them regularly as an application task.
The LiveCompare tool is also available to scan regularly for divergence.

Some clustering systems use distributed lock mechanisms to prevent
concurrent access to data. These can perform reasonably when servers are
very close to each other but can't support geographically distributed applications where
very low latency is critical for acceptable performance.

Distributed locking is essentially a pessimistic approach. BDR
advocates an optimistic approach, which is to avoid conflicts where possible but allow
some types of conflicts to occur and resolve them when they arise.

!!! Warning "Upgrade Notes"
    All the SQL-visible interfaces are in the `bdr` schema.
    All the previously deprecated interfaces in the `bdr_conflicts` or
    `bdr_crdt` schema were removed and don't work on 3.7+ nodes or in
    groups that contain at least one 3.7+ node.
    Use the ones in the `bdr` schema that are already present in all BDR versions.

## How conflicts happen

Inter-node conflicts arise as a result of sequences of events that can't
happen if all the involved transactions happen concurrently on the same
node. Because the nodes exchange changes only after the transactions commit,
each transaction is individually valid on the node it committed on. It isn't
valid if applied on another node that did other conflicting work
at the same time.

Since BDR replication essentially replays the transaction on the other nodes,
the replay operation can fail if there's a conflict between a transaction
being applied and a transaction that was committed on the receiving node.

Most conflicts can't happen when all transactions run on a single
node because PostgreSQL has inter-transaction communication mechanisms
to prevent it such as `UNIQUE` indexes, `SEQUENCE` operations, row and relation locking, and
`SERIALIZABLE` dependency tracking. All of these mechanisms are ways
to communicate between ongoing transactions to prevent undesirable concurrency
issues.

BDR doesn't have a distributed transaction manager or lock manager.
That's part of why it performs well with latency and network partitions. As
a result, transactions on different nodes execute entirely independently
from each other when using the default, lazy replication. Less independence
between nodes can avoid conflicts altogether, which is why BDR also offers
Eager Replication for when this is important.

## Types of conflict

### PRIMARY KEY or UNIQUE conflicts

The most common conflicts are row conflicts, where two operations affect a
row with the same key in ways they can't on a single node. BDR can
detect most of those and applies the `update_if_newer` conflict resolver.

Row conflicts include:

-   `INSERT` versus `INSERT`
-   `UPDATE` versus `UPDATE`
-   `UPDATE` versus `DELETE`
-   `INSERT` versus `UPDATE`
-   `INSERT` versus `DELETE`
-   `DELETE` versus `DELETE`

The view `bdr.node_conflict_resolvers` provides information on how
conflict resolution is currently configured for all known conflict types.

#### INSERT/INSERT conflicts

The most common conflict, `INSERT`/`INSERT`, arises where `INSERT` operations on two
different nodes create a tuple with the same `PRIMARY KEY` values (or if no
`PRIMARY KEY` exists, the same values for a single `UNIQUE` constraint).

BDR handles this situation by retaining the most recently inserted tuple of the two
according to the originating host's timestamps, unless this behavior is overridden by a
user-defined conflict handler.

This conflict generates the `insert_exists` conflict type, which is by
default resolved by choosing the newer (based on commit time) row and keeping
only that one (`update_if_newer` resolver). You can configure other resolvers. 
See [Conflict resolution](#conflict-resolution) for details.

To resolve this conflict type, you can also use column-level conflict
resolution and user-defined conflict triggers.

You can effectively eliminate this type of conflict by using
[global sequences](sequences).

#### INSERT operations that violate multiple UNIQUE constraints

An `INSERT`/`INSERT` conflict can violate more than one `UNIQUE` constraint
(of which one might be the `PRIMARY KEY`). If a new row violates more than
one `UNIQUE` constraint and that results in a conflict against more than one
other row, then the apply of the replication change produces a
`multiple_unique_conflicts` conflict.

In case of such a conflict, you must remove some rows for replication
to continue. Depending on the resolver setting for `multiple_unique_conflicts`,
the apply process either exits with error, skips the incoming row, or deletes
some of the rows. The deletion tries to
preserve the row with the correct `PRIMARY KEY` and delete the others.

!!! Warning
    In case of multiple rows conflicting this way, if the result of conflict
    resolution is to proceed with the insert operation, some of the data 
    is always deleted.

It's also possible to define a different behavior using a conflict trigger.

#### UPDATE/UPDATE conflicts

Where two concurrent `UPDATE` operations on different nodes change the same tuple
(but not its `PRIMARY KEY`), an `UPDATE`/`UPDATE` conflict can occur on replay.

These can generate different conflict kinds based on the configuration and
situation. If the table is configured with [row version conflict detection](#row-version-conflict-detection),
then the original (key) row is compared with the local row.
If they're different, the `update_differing` conflict is generated.
When using [Origin conflict detection],
the origin of the row is checked (the origin is the node that the current
local row came from). If that changed, the `update_origin_change` conflict
is generated. In all other cases, the `UPDATE` is normally applied without
generating a conflict.

Both of these conflicts are resolved the same way as `insert_exists`, described in [INSERT/INSERT conflicts](#insertinsert-conflicts).

#### UPDATE conflicts on the PRIMARY KEY

BDR can't currently perform conflict resolution where the `PRIMARY KEY`
is changed by an `UPDATE` operation. You can update the primary
key, but you must ensure that no conflict with existing values is possible.

Conflicts on the update of the primary key are [Divergent conflicts](#divergent-conflicts) and
require manual intervention.

Updating a primary key is possible in PostgreSQL, but there are
issues in both PostgreSQL and BDR.

A simple schema provides an example that explains:

```sql
CREATE TABLE pktest (pk integer primary key, val integer);
INSERT INTO pktest VALUES (1,1);
```

Updating the Primary Key column is possible, so this SQL succeeds:

```sql
UPDATE pktest SET pk=2 WHERE pk=1;
```

However, suppose there are multiple rows in the table:

```sql
INSERT INTO pktest VALUES (3,3);
```

Some UPDATE operations succeed:

```sql
UPDATE pktest SET pk=4 WHERE pk=3;

SELECT * FROM pktest;
 pk | val
----+-----
  2 |   1
  4 |   3
(2 rows)
```

Other UPDATE operations fail with constraint errors:

```sql
UPDATE pktest SET pk=4 WHERE pk=2;
ERROR:  duplicate key value violates unique constraint "pktest_pkey"
DETAIL:  Key (pk)=(4) already exists
```

So for PostgreSQL applications that update primary keys, be
careful to avoid runtime errors, even without BDR.

With BDR, the situation becomes more complex if UPDATE operations are
allowed from multiple locations at same time.

Executing these two changes concurrently works:

```sql
node1: UPDATE pktest SET pk=pk+1 WHERE pk = 2;
node2: UPDATE pktest SET pk=pk+1 WHERE pk = 4;

SELECT * FROM pktest;
 pk | val
----+-----
  3 |   1
  5 |   3
(2 rows)
```

Executing these next two changes concurrently causes
a divergent error, since both changes are accepted. But applying
the changes on the other node results in
`update_missing` conflicts.

```sql
node1: UPDATE pktest SET pk=1 WHERE pk = 3;
node2: UPDATE pktest SET pk=2 WHERE pk = 3;
```

This scenario leaves the data different on each node:

```sql
node1:
SELECT * FROM pktest;
 pk | val
----+-----
  1 |   1
  5 |   3
(2 rows)

node2:
SELECT * FROM pktest;
 pk | val
----+-----
  2 |   1
  5 |   3
(2 rows)
```

You can identify and resolve this situation using LiveCompare.

Concurrent conflicts present problems. Executing these two changes
concurrently isn't easy to resolve:

```sql
node1: UPDATE pktest SET pk=6, val=8 WHERE pk = 5;
node2: UPDATE pktest SET pk=6, val=9 WHERE pk = 5;
```

Both changes are applied locally, causing a divergence between
the nodes. But then apply on the target fails on both nodes with
a duplicate key-value violation error, which causes the replication
to halt and requires manual resolution.

This duplicate key violation error can now be avoided,
and replication doesn't break if you set the conflict_type
`update_pkey_exists` to `skip`, `update`, or `update_if_newer`. This
can still lead to divergence depending on the nature of the update.

You can avoid divergence in cases where the same
old key is being updated by the same new key concurrently by setting
`update_pkey_exists` to `update_if_newer`. However, in certain situations,
divergence occurs even with `update_if_newer`, namely when two different
rows both are updated concurrently to the same new primary key.

As a result, we recommend strongly against allowing primary key UPDATE operations
in your applications, especially with BDR. If parts
of your application change primary keys, then to avoid concurrent
changes, make those changes using Eager Replication.

!!! Warning
    In case the conflict resolution of `update_pkey_exists` conflict results
    in update, one of the rows is always deleted.

#### UPDATE operations that violate multiple UNIQUE constraints

Like [INSERT operations that violate multiple UNIQUE constraints](#insert-operations-that-violate-multiple-unique-constraints), where an incoming
`UPDATE` violates more than one `UNIQUE` index (or the `PRIMARY KEY`), BDR
raises a `multiple_unique_conflicts` conflict.

BDR supports deferred unique constraints. If a transaction can commit on the
source, then it applies cleanly on target, unless it sees conflicts.
However, a deferred primary key can't be used as a REPLICA IDENTITY, so
the use cases are already limited by that and the warning about using
multiple unique constraints.

#### UPDATE/DELETE conflicts

It's possible for one node to update a row that another node simultaneously
deletes. In this case an `UPDATE`/`DELETE` conflict can occur on replay.

If the deleted row is still detectable (the deleted row wasn't removed by `VACUUM`),
the `update_recently_deleted` conflict is generated. By default the
`UPDATE` is skipped, but you can configure the resolution for this.
See [Conflict resolution](#conflict-resolution) for details.

The deleted row can be cleaned up from the database by the time the `UPDATE`
is received in case the local node is lagging behind in replication. In this
case, BDR can't differentiate between `UPDATE`/`DELETE`
conflicts and [INSERT/UPDATE conflicts](#insertupdate-conflicts) and generates the
`update_missing` conflict.

Another type of conflicting `DELETE` and `UPDATE` is a `DELETE`
that comes after the row was updated locally. In this situation, the
outcome depends on the type of conflict detection used. When using the
default, [origin conflict detection](#origin-conflict-detection), no conflict is detected at all,
leading to the `DELETE` being applied and the row removed. If you enable
[row version conflict detection](#row-version-conflict-detection), a `delete_recently_updated` conflict is
generated. The default resolution for this conflict type is to apply the
`DELETE` and remove the row, but you can configure this or this can be handled by
a conflict trigger.

#### INSERT/UPDATE conflicts

When using the default asynchronous mode of operation, a node might receive an
`UPDATE` of a row before the original `INSERT` was received. This can
happen only with three or more nodes being active (see [Conflicts with three or more nodes](#conflicts-with-three-or-more-nodes)).

When this happens, the `update_missing` conflict is generated. The default
conflict resolver is `insert_or_skip`, though you can use `insert_or_error` or `skip`
instead. Resolvers that do insert-or-action first
try to `INSERT` a new row based on data
from the `UPDATE` when possible (when the whole row was received). For the
reconstruction of the row to be possible, the table either needs to have
`REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` or the row must not contain any toasted data.

See [TOAST support details](#toast-support-details) for more info about toasted data.

#### INSERT/DELETE conflicts

Similar to the `INSERT`/`UPDATE` conflict, the node might also receive a
`DELETE` operation on a row for which it didn't yet receive an `INSERT`. This
is again possible only with three or more nodes set up (see [Conflicts with three or more nodes](#conflicts-with-three-or-more-nodes)).

BDR can't currently detect this conflict type. The `INSERT` operation
doesn't generate any conflict type and the `INSERT` is applied.

The `DELETE` operation always generates a `delete_missing` conflict, which
is by default resolved by skipping the operation.

#### DELETE/DELETE conflicts

A `DELETE`/`DELETE` conflict arises when two different nodes concurrently
delete the same tuple.

This always generates a `delete_missing` conflict, which is by default
resolved by skipping the operation.

This conflict is harmless since both `DELETE` operations have the same effect. One
of them can be safely ignored.

#### Conflicts with three or more nodes

If one node inserts a row that is then replayed to a second node and updated
there, a third node can receive the `UPDATE` from the second node before it
receives the `INSERT` from the first node. This scenario is an `INSERT`/`UPDATE` conflict.

These conflicts are handled by discarding the `UPDATE`. This can lead to
different data on different nodes. These are [divergent conflicts](#divergent conflicts).

This conflict type can happen only with three or more masters, of which at
least two must be actively writing.

Also, the replication lag from node 1 to node 3 must be high enough to
allow the following sequence of actions:

1.  node 2 receives INSERT from node 1
2.  node 2 performs UPDATE
3.  node 3 receives UPDATE from node 2
4.  node 3 receives INSERT from node 1

Using `insert_or_error` (or in some cases the `insert_or_skip` conflict resolver
for the `update_missing` conflict type) is a viable mitigation strategy for
these conflicts. However, enabling this option opens the door for
`INSERT`/`DELETE` conflicts:

1.  node 1 performs UPDATE
2.  node 2 performs DELETE
3.  node 3 receives DELETE from node 2
4.  node 3 receives UPDATE from node 1, turning it into an INSERT

If these are problems, we recommend tuning freezing settings for a table
or database so that they are correctly detected as `update_recently_deleted`.

Another alternative is to use [Eager Replication](eager) to prevent these conflicts.

`INSERT`/`DELETE` conflicts can also occur with three or more nodes.
Such a conflict is identical to `INSERT`/`UPDATE` except with the
`UPDATE` replaced by a `DELETE`. This can result in a `delete_missing`
conflict.

BDR could choose to make each INSERT into a check-for-recently
deleted, as occurs with an `update_missing` conflict. However, the
cost of doing this penalizes the majority of users, so at this time
it simply logs `delete_missing`.

Later releases will automatically resolve `INSERT`/`DELETE` anomalies
via rechecks using LiveCompare when `delete_missing` conflicts occur.
These can be performed manually by applications by checking
the `bdr.conflict_history_summary` view.

These conflicts can occur in two main problem use cases:

-   `INSERT` followed rapidly by a `DELETE`, as can be used in queuing applications
-   Any case where the primary key identifier of a table is reused

Neither of these cases is common. We recommend not replicating
the affected tables if these problem use cases occur.

BDR has problems with the latter case because BDR relies on the
uniqueness of identifiers to make replication work correctly.

Applications that insert, delete, and
then later reuse the same unique identifiers can cause difficulties.
This is known as the [ABA problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_problem). BDR has no way of knowing whether
the rows are the current row, the last row, or much older rows.

Unique identifier reuse is also a business problem, since it is
prevents unique identification over time, which prevents auditing,
traceability, and sensible data quality. Applications don't need
to reuse unique identifiers.

Any identifier reuse that occurs in the time interval it takes for
changes to pass across the system causes difficulties. Although that
time might be short in normal operation, down nodes can extend that
interval to hours or days.

We recommend that applications don't reuse unique identifiers, but if they
do, take steps to avoid reuse within a period of less than a year.

This problem doesn't occur in applications that use sequences or UUIDs.

### Foreign key constraint conflicts

Conflicts between a remote transaction being applied and existing local data
can also occur for `FOREIGN KEY` (FK) constraints.

BDR applies changes with `session_replication_role = 'replica'`, so foreign
keys aren't rechecked when applying changes.
In an active/active environment, this can result in FK violations if deletes
occur to the referenced table at the same time as inserts into the referencing
table. This is similar to an `INSERT`/`DELETE` conflict.

In single-master PostgreSQL, any `INSERT`/`UPDATE` that refers to a value in the
referenced table must wait for `DELETE` operations to finish before they can gain
a row-level lock. If a `DELETE` removes a referenced value, then the `INSERT`/`UPDATE` fails the FK check.

In multi-master BDR. there are no inter-node row-level locks. An `INSERT` on
the referencing table doesn't wait behind a `DELETE` on the referenced table,
so both actions can occur concurrently. Thus an `INSERT`/`UPDATE` on one node
on the referencing table can use a value at the same time as a `DELETE`
on the referenced table on another node. This then results in a value
in the referencing table that's no longer present in the referenced
table.

In practice, this occurs if the `DELETE` operations occurs on referenced tables
in separate transactions from `DELETE` operations on referencing tables. This isn't
a common operation.

In a parent-child relationship such as Orders -> OrderItems, it isn't typical to
do this. It's more likely to mark an OrderItem as canceled than to remove it
completely. For reference/lookup data, it's unusual to completely
remove entries at the same time as using those same values for new fact data.

While there's a possibility of dangling FKs, the risk of this in general
is very low and so BDR doesn't impose a generic solution to cover this case.
Once you understand the situation in which this occurs, two solutions are
possible.

The first solution is to restrict the use of FKs to closely
related entities that are generally modified from only one node at a time, are
infrequently modified, or where the modification's concurrency is
application-mediated. This avoids any FK violations at the application
level.

The second solution is to add triggers to protect against this case using
the BDR-provided functions `bdr.ri_fkey_trigger()` and
`bdr.ri_fkey_on_del_trigger()`. When called as `BEFORE` triggers, these
functions use `FOREIGN KEY` information to avoid FK anomalies by
setting referencing columns to NULL, much as if you had a SET NULL constraint.
This rechecks all FKs in one trigger, so you need to add only one
trigger per table to prevent FK violation.

As an example, suppose you have two tables: Fact and RefData. Fact has an FK that
references RefData. Fact is the referencing table and RefData is the referenced
table. You need to add one trigger to each table.

Add a trigger that sets columns to NULL in Fact if the referenced row
in RefData was already deleted.

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER bdr_replica_fk_iu_trg
    BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON fact
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE PROCEDURE bdr.ri_fkey_trigger();

ALTER TABLE fact
    ENABLE REPLICA TRIGGER bdr_replica_fk_iu_trg;
```

Add a trigger that sets columns to NULL in Fact at the time a DELETE occurs
on the RefData table.

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER bdr_replica_fk_d_trg
    BEFORE DELETE ON refdata
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE PROCEDURE bdr.ri_fkey_on_del_trigger();

ALTER TABLE refdata
    ENABLE REPLICA TRIGGER bdr_replica_fk_d_trg;
```

Adding both triggers avoids dangling foreign keys.

### TRUNCATE conflicts

`TRUNCATE` behaves similarly to a `DELETE` of all rows but performs this
action by physically removing the table data rather than row-by-row
deletion. As a result, row-level conflict handling isn't available, so
`TRUNCATE` commands don't generate conflicts with other DML actions,
even when there's a clear conflict.

As a result, the ordering of replay can cause divergent changes if
another DML is executed concurrently on other nodes to the `TRUNCATE`.

You can take one of the following actions:

-   Ensure `TRUNCATE` isn't executed alongside other concurrent DML.
    Rely on LiveCompare to highlight any such inconsistency.

-   Replace `TRUNCATE` with a `DELETE` statement with no `WHERE` clause.
    This approach is likely to have very poor performance on
    larger tables.

-   Set `bdr.truncate_locking = 'on'` to set the `TRUNCATE` command’s
    locking behavior. This setting determines whether `TRUNCATE` obeys the `bdr.ddl_locking`
    setting. This
    isn't the default behavior for `TRUNCATE` since it requires all nodes
    to be up. This configuration might not be possible or wanted in all cases.

### Exclusion constraint conflicts

BDR doesn't support exclusion constraints and prevents their creation.

If an existing standalone database is converted to a BDR database, then
drop all exclusion constraints manually.

In a distributed asynchronous system, you can't ensure that no
set of rows that violate the constraint exists, because all transactions
on different nodes are fully isolated. Exclusion constraints lead to
replay deadlocks where replay can't progress from any node to any
other node because of exclusion constraint violations.

If you force BDR to create an exclusion constraint, or you don't drop
existing ones when converting a standalone database to BDR,
expect replication to break. To get it to progress again, remove or alter the
local tuples that an incoming remote tuple conflicts with so that the remote
transaction can be applied.

### Data conflicts for roles and tablespace differences

Conflicts can also arise where nodes have global (PostgreSQL-system-wide)
data, like roles, that differ. This can result in operations&mdash;mainly
`DDL`&mdash;that can run successfully and commit on one node but then
fail to apply to other nodes.

For example, node1 might have a user named fred, and that user wasn't
created on node2. If fred on node1 creates a table, the table is
replicated with its owner set to fred. When the DDL command is applied to
node2, the DDL fails because there's no user named fred. This failure
emits an error in the PostgreSQL logs.

Administrator intervention is required to resolve this conflict
by creating the user fred in the database where BDR is running.
You can set `bdr.role_replication = on` to resolve this in future.

### Lock conflicts and deadlock aborts

Because BDR writer processes operate much like normal user sessions, they're
subject to the usual rules around row and table locking. This can sometimes
lead to BDR writer processes waiting on locks held by user transactions or
even by each other.

Relevant locking includes:

-   Explicit table-level locking (`LOCK TABLE ...`) by user sessions
-   Explicit row-level locking (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE/FOR SHARE`) by user sessions
-   Implicit locking because of row `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, or `DELETE` operations, either
    from local activity or from replication from other nodes

A BDR writer process can deadlock with a user
transaction, where the user transaction is waiting on a lock held
by the writer process and vice versa. Two writer processes can also
deadlock with each other. PostgreSQL's deadlock detector steps in and
terminates one of the problem transactions. If the BDR writer process is
terminated, it retries and generally succeeds.

All these issues are transient and generally require no administrator
action. If a writer process is stuck for a long time behind a lock
on an idle user session, the administrator can terminate
the user session to get replication flowing again, but this is
no different from a user holding a long lock that impacts another
user session.

Use of the [log_lock_waits](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-logging.html#GUC-LOG-LOCK-WAITS)
facility in PostgreSQL can help identify locking related replay stalls.

### Divergent conflicts

Divergent conflicts arise when data that should be the same on different
nodes differs unexpectedly. Divergent conflicts should not occur, but not
all such conflicts can be reliably prevented at the time of writing.

Changing the `PRIMARY KEY` of a row can lead to a divergent conflict if
another node changes the key of the same row before all nodes have replayed
the change. Avoid changing primary keys, or change them only on one designated
node.

Divergent conflicts involving row data generally require administrator
action to manually adjust the data on one of the nodes to be consistent
with the other one. Such conflicts don't arise so long as you use BDR as documented 
and avoid settings or functions marked as unsafe.

The administrator must manually resolve such conflicts. You might need to use the
advanced options such as `bdr.ddl_replication` and `bdr.ddl_locking` depending on the 
nature of the conflict. However, careless use of
these options can make things much worse and create a conflict that generic instructions can't address.

### TOAST support details

PostgreSQL uses out-of-line storage for larger columns called
[TOAST](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/storage-toast.html).

The TOAST values handling in logical decoding (which BDR is built on top of)
and logical replication is different from inline data stored as part of the
main row in the table.

The TOAST value is logged into the transaction log (WAL) only if the value
has changed. This can cause problems, especially when handling UPDATE conflicts
because an `UPDATE` statement that didn't change a value of a toasted column
produces a row without that column. As mentioned in
[INSERT/UPDATE conflicts](#insertupdate-conflicts), BDR reports an error if an `update_missing`
conflict is resolved using `insert_or_error` and there are missing TOAST columns.

However, there are more subtle issues than this one in case of concurrent
workloads with asynchronous replication (Eager transactions aren't affected).
Imagine, for example, the following workload on a BDR cluster with three nodes called
A, B, and C:

1.  On node A: txn A1 does an UPDATE SET col1 = 'toast data...' and commits first.
2.  On node B: txn B1 does UPDATE SET other_column = 'anything else'; and commits after A1.
3.  On node C: the connection to node A lags behind.
4.  On node C: txn B1 is applied first, it misses the TOASTed column in col1,
    but gets applied without conflict.
5.  On node C: txn A1 conflicts (on update_origin_change) and is skipped.
6.  Node C misses the toasted data from A1 forever.

This scenario isn't usually a problem when using BDR. (It is when using
either built-in logical replication or plain pglogical for multi-master.)
BDR adds its own logging of TOAST columns when it detects a local UPDATE
to a row that recently replicated a TOAST column modification and the local
UPDATE isn't modifying the TOAST. Thus BDR prevents any inconsistency for
toasted data across different nodes. This situation causes increased WAL logging
when updates occur on multiple nodes (that is, when origin changes for a tuple).
Additional WAL overhead is zero if all updates are made from a single node,
as is normally the case with BDR AlwaysOn architecture.

!!! Note
    Running `VACUUM FULL` or `CLUSTER` on just the TOAST table without
    also doing same on the main table removes metadata needed for the
    extra logging to work. This means that, for a short period of time after
    such a statement, the protection against these concurrency issues isn't
    be present.

!!! Warning
    The additional WAL logging of TOAST is done using the `BEFORE UPDATE`
    trigger on standard PostgreSQL. This trigger must be sorted alphabetically
    last (based on trigger name) among all `BEFORE UPDATE` triggers on the
    table. It's prefixed with `zzzz_bdr_` to make this easier, but make sure
    you don't create any trigger with a name that sorts after it. Otherwise
    you won't have the protection against the concurrency issues.

For the `insert_or_error` conflict resolution, the use of
`REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` is, however, still required.

None of these problems associated with toasted columns affect tables with
`REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`. This setting always logs a toasted value as
part of the key since the whole row is considered to be part of the key. BDR
can reconstruct the new row, filling the
missing data from the key row. As a result, using
`REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` can increase WAL size significantly.

## Avoiding or tolerating conflicts

In most cases, you can design the application to avoid or tolerate conflicts.

Conflicts can happen only if things are happening at the same time on
multiple nodes. The simplest way to avoid conflicts is to only ever write
to one node or to only ever write to a specific row in a specific way from
one specific node at a time.

This happens naturally in many applications. For example, many
consumer applications allow data to be changed only by the owning user, such as
changing the default billing address on your account. Such data changes seldom
have update conflicts.

You might make a change just before a node goes down, so the
change seems to be lost. You might then make the same change again,
leading to two updates on different nodes. When the down node comes back up,
it tries to send the older change to other nodes, but it's rejected
because the last update of the data is kept.

For `INSERT`/`INSERT` conflicts, use [global sequences](sequences)
to prevent this type of conflict.

For applications that assign relationships between objects, such as a room
booking application, applying `update_if_newer` might not give an acceptable
business outcome. That is, it isn't useful to confirm to two people separately
that they have booked the same room. The simplest resolution is to use Eager
Replication to ensure that only one booking succeeds. More complex ways
might be possible depending on the application. For example, you can assign 100 seats
to each node and allow those to be booked by a writer on that node. But if
none are available locally, use a distributed locking scheme or Eager
Replication once most seats are reserved.

Another technique for ensuring certain types of updates occur only from one
specific node is to route different types of transactions through
different nodes. For example:

-   Receiving parcels on one node but delivering parcels using another node
-   A service application where orders are input on one node, work is
    prepared on a second node, and then served back to customers on another

Frequently, the best course is to allow conflicts to occur and
design the application to work with BDR's conflict resolution
mechanisms to cope with the conflict.

## Conflict detection

BDR provides these mechanisms for conflict detection:

-   [Origin conflict detection](#origin-conflict-detection) (default)
-   [Row version conflict detection](#row-version-conflict-detection)
-   [Column-level conflict detection](column-level-conflicts)

### Origin conflict detection

(Previously known as timestamp conflict detection.)

Origin conflict detection uses and relies on commit timestamps as
recorded on the host the transaction originates from. This
requires clocks to be in sync to work correctly or to be within a
tolerance of the fastest message between two nodes. If this
isn't the case, conflict resolution tends to favor the node that's
further ahead. You can manage clock skew between nodes using the
parameters `bdr.maximum_clock_skew` and `bdr.maximum_clock_skew_action`.

Row origins are available only if `track_commit_timestamp = on`.

Conflicts are initially detected based on whether the replication
origin changed, so conflict triggers are called in
situations that might turn out not to be conflicts. Hence, this
mechanism isn't precise, since it can generate false-positive conflicts.

Origin info is available only up to the point where a row is frozen.
Updates arriving for a row after it was frozen don't raise
a conflict so are applied in all cases. This is the normal case
when adding a new node by `bdr_init_physical`, so raising conflicts
causes many false-positive results in that case.

When a node that was offline reconnects and
begins sending data changes, this can cause divergent
errors if the newly arrived updates are older than the
frozen rows that they update. Inserts and deletes aren't affected by this situation.

We suggest that you don't leave down nodes for extended outages,
as discussed in [Node restart and down node recovery](nodes).

On EDB Postgres Extended Server and EDB Postgres Advanced Server, BDR
holds back the freezing of rows while a node is down. This mechanism handles
this situation gracefully so you don't need to change parameter settings.

On other variants of Postgres, you might need to manage this situation with
some care.

Freezing normally occurs when a row being vacuumed is older than
`vacuum_freeze_min_age` xids from the current xid, which means that you
need to configure suitably high values for these parameters:

-   `vacuum_freeze_min_age`
-   `vacuum_freeze_table_age`
-   `autovacuum_freeze_max_age`

Choose values based on the transaction rate, giving
a grace period of downtime before removing any conflict data 
from the database server. For example, when `vacuum_freeze_min_age` is set to 500 million, a node performing
1000 TPS can be down for just over 5.5 days before conflict
data is removed.
The CommitTS data structure takes on-disk space of 5 GB with
that setting, so lower transaction rate systems can benefit from
lower settings.

Initially recommended settings are:

```sql
# 1 billion = 10GB
autovacuum_freeze_max_age = 1000000000

vacuum_freeze_min_age = 500000000

# 90% of autovacuum_freeze_max_age
vacuum_freeze_table_age = 900000000
```

Note that:

-   You can set `autovacuum_freeze_max_age` only at server start.
-   You can set `vacuum_freeze_min_age`, so using a
    low value freezes rows early and can result in conflicts being
    ignored. You can also set `autovacuum_freeze_min_age` and `toast.autovacuum_freeze_min_age`
    for individual tables.
-   Running the CLUSTER or VACUUM FREEZE commands also
    freezes rows early and can result in conflicts being ignored.

### Row version conflict detection

Alternatively, BDR provides the option to use row versioning and make
conflict detection independent of the nodes' system clock.

Row version conflict detection requires that you enable three things. If any of these
steps aren't performed correctly then [origin conflict detection](origin-conflict-detection) is used.

1.  `check_full_tuple` must be enabled for the BDR node group.

2.  `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` must be enabled on all tables that use
    row version conflict detection.

3.  Row Version Tracking must be enabled on the table by using
    `bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection`. This function adds a column
    (with a name you specify) and an `UPDATE` trigger that manages the new
    column value. The column is created as `INTEGER` type.

Although the counter is incremented only on `UPDATE`, this technique allows
conflict detection for both `UPDATE` and `DELETE`.

This approach resembles Lamport timestamps and fully prevents
the ABA problem for conflict detection.

!!! Note
    The row-level conflict resolution is still handled based on the
    [conflict resolution](#conflict-resolution) configuration even with row versioning. The way
    the row version is generated is useful only for detecting conflicts.
    Don't rely on it as authoritative information about which
    version of row is newer.

To determine the current conflict resolution strategy used for a specific
table, refer to the column `conflict_detection` of the view `bdr.tables`.

### bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection

Allows the table owner to change how conflict detection works for a given table.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection(relation regclass,
                                   method text,
                                   column_name name DEFAULT NULL)
```

#### Parameters

-   `relation` &mdash; Name of the relation for which to set the new conflict detection method.
-   `method` &mdash; The conflict detection method to use.
-   `column_name` &mdash; The column to use for storing the column detection data.
    This can be skipped, in which case the column name is chosen based
    on the conflict detection method. The `row_origin` method doesn't require an
    extra column for metadata storage.

The recognized methods for conflict detection are:

-   `row_origin` &mdash; Origin of the previous change made on the tuple (see
    [Origin conflict detection](#origin-conflict-resolution)). This is the only method supported that
    doesn't require an extra column in the table.
-   `row_version` &mdash; Row version column (see [Row version conflict detection](#row-version-conflict-detection)).
-   `column_commit_timestamp` &mdash; Per-column commit timestamps (described in
    [CLCD](column-level-conflicts)).
-   `column_modify_timestamp` &mdash; Per-column modification timestamp (described in
    [CLCD](column-level-conflicts)).

#### Notes

For more information about the difference between `column_commit_timestamp`
and `column_modify_timestamp` conflict detection methods, see
[Current versus commit timestamp](column-level-conflicts#current-vs-commit-timestamp]).

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This
means the replication is affected by the [ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration.

The function takes a `DML` global lock on the relation for which
column-level conflict resolution is being enabled.

This function is transactional. You can roll back the effects back with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction, and the changes are visible to the current
transaction.

The `bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection` function can be executed only by
the owner of the `relation`, unless `bdr.backwards_compatibility` is
set to 30618 or below.

!!! Warning
    When changing the conflict detection method from one that
    uses an extra column to store metadata, that column is dropped.

!!! Warning
    This function disables CAMO (together with a warning, as
    long as these aren't disabled with `bdr.camo_enable_client_warnings`).

### List of conflict types

BDR recognizes the following conflict types, which can be used as the
`conflict_type` parameter:

-   `insert_exists` &mdash; An incoming insert conflicts with an existing row via a
    primary key or a unique key/index.
-   `update_differing` &mdash; An incoming update's key row differs from a local
    row. This can happen only when using [row version conflict detection](#row-version-conflict-detection).
-   `update_origin_change` &mdash; An incoming update is modifying a row that was
    last changed by a different node.
-   `update_missing` &mdash; An incoming update is trying to modify a row that doesn't
    exist.
-   `update_recently_deleted` &mdash; An incoming update is trying to modify a row
    that was recently deleted.
-   `update_pkey_exists` &mdash; An incoming update has modified the `PRIMARY KEY` to
    a value that already exists on the node that's applying the change.
-   `multiple_unique_conflicts` &mdash; The incoming row conflicts with multiple
    UNIQUE constraints/indexes in the target table.
-   `delete_recently_updated` &mdash; An incoming delete with an older commit timestamp
    than the most recent update of the row on the current node, or when
    using [Row version conflict detection].
-   `delete_missing` &mdash; An incoming delete is trying to remove a row that doesn't
    exist.
-   `target_column_missing` &mdash; The target table is missing one or more columns
    present in the incoming row.
-   `source_column_missing` &mdash; The incoming row is missing one or more columns
    that are present in the target table.
-   `target_table_missing` &mdash; The target table is missing.
-   `apply_error_ddl` &mdash; An error was thrown by PostgreSQL when applying a
    replicated DDL command.

## Conflict resolution

Most conflicts can be resolved automatically. BDR defaults to a
last-update-wins mechanism or, more accurately, the `update_if_newer`
conflict resolver. This mechanism retains the most recently
inserted or changed row of the two conflicting ones based on the same
commit timestamps used for conflict detection. The behavior in certain corner-case
scenarios depends on the settings used for bdr.create_node_group and
alternatively for bdr.alter_node_group.

BDR lets you override the default behavior of conflict resolution by using the
following function:

### bdr.alter_node_set_conflict_resolver

This function sets the behavior of conflict resolution on a given node.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_node_set_conflict_resolver(node_name text,
                                     conflict_type text,
                                     conflict_resolver text)
```

#### Parameters

-   `node_name` &mdash; Name of the node that's being changed.
-   `conflict_type` &mdash; Conflict type for which to apply the setting
    (see [List of conflict types](#list-of-conflict-types)).
-   `conflict_resolver` &mdash; Resolver to use for the given conflict type
    (see [List of conflict resolvers](#list-of-conflict-resolvers)).

#### Notes

Currently you can change only the local node. The function call isn't
replicated. If you want to change settings on multiple nodes, you must run the function
on each of them.

The configuration change made by this function overrides any
default behavior of conflict resolutions specified by bdr.create_node_group
or `bdr.alter_node_group`.

This function is transactional. You can roll back the changes, and
they are visible to the current transaction.

### List of conflict resolvers

Several conflict resolvers are available in BDR, with differing coverages
of the conflict types they can handle:

-   `error` &mdash; Throws error and stops replication.
    Can be used for any conflict type.
-   `skip` &mdash; Skips processing the remote change and continues replication
    with the next change.
    Can be used for `insert_exists`, `update_differing`, `update_origin_change`,
    `update_missing`, `update_recently_deleted`, `update_pkey_exists`,
    `delete_recently_updated`, `delete_missing`, `target_table_missing`,
    `target_column_missing`, and `source_column_missing` conflict types.
-   `skip_if_recently_dropped` &mdash; Skip the remote change if it's for a table that
    doesn't exist downstream because it was recently (within
    one day) dropped on the downstream; throw an error otherwise. Can be used for
    the `target_table_missing` conflict type. `skip_if_recently_dropped` conflict
    resolver can pose challenges if a table with the same name is re-created shortly
    after it's dropped. In that case, one of the nodes might see the DMLs on the
    re-created table before it sees the DDL to re-create the table. It then
    incorrectly skips the remote data, assuming that the table is recently dropped,
    and causes data loss. We hence recommend that you don't reuse the object namesq
    immediately after they are dropped along with this conflict resolver.
-   `skip_transaction` &mdash; Skips the whole transaction that generated the
    conflict. Can be used for `apply_error_ddl` conflict.
-   `update_if_newer` &mdash; Update if the remote row was committed later (as
    determined by the wall clock of the originating server) than the conflicting
    local row. If the timestamps are same, the node id is used as a tie-breaker
    to ensure that same row is picked on all nodes (higher nodeid wins).
    Can be used for `insert_exists`, `update_differing`, `update_origin_change`,
    and `update_pkey_exists` conflict types.
-   `update` &mdash; Always perform the replicated action.
    Can be used for `insert_exists` (turns the `INSERT` into `UPDATE`),
    `update_differing`, `update_origin_change`, `update_pkey_exists`,
    and `delete_recently_updated` (performs the delete).
-   `insert_or_skip` &mdash; Try to build a new row from available information sent by
    the origin and INSERT it. If there isn't enough information available to build
    a full row, skip the change.
    Can be used for `update_missing` and `update_recently_deleted` conflict types.
-   `insert_or_error` &mdash; Try to build new row from available information sent by
    origin and insert it. If there isn't enough information available to build
    full row, throw an error and stop the replication.
    Can be used for `update_missing` and `update_recently_deleted` conflict types.
-   `ignore` &mdash; Ignore any missing target column and continue processing.
    Can be used for the `target_column_missing` conflict type.
-   `ignore_if_null` &mdash; Ignore a missing target column if the extra column in the
    remote row contains a NULL value. Otherwise, throw an error and stop replication.
    Can be used for the `target_column_missing` conflict type.
-   `use_default_value` &mdash; Fill the missing column value with the default (including
    NULL if that's the column default) and continue processing. Any error while
    processing the default or violation of constraints (i.e., NULL default on
    NOT NULL column) stops replication.
    Can be used for the `source_column_missing` conflict type.

The `insert_exists`, `update_differing`, `update_origin_change`,
`update_missing`, `multiple_unique_conflicts`, `update_recently_deleted`,
`update_pkey_exists`, `delete_recently_updated, and `delete_missing` conflict
types can also be resolved by user-defined logic using
[Conflict triggers](striggers).

This matrix helps you individuate the conflict types the conflict
resolvers can handle.

### List of conflict resolutions

The conflict resolution represents the kind of resolution chosen by the
conflict resolver and corresponds to the specific action that was
taken to resolve the conflict.

The following conflict resolutions are currently supported for the
`conflict_resolution` parameter:

-   `apply_remote` &mdash; The remote (incoming) row was applied.
-   `skip` &mdash; Processing of the row was skipped (no change was made
    locally).
-   `merge` &mdash; A new row was created, merging information from remote and local row.
-   `user` &mdash; User code (a conflict trigger) produced the row that was written
    to the target table.

## Conflict logging

To ease the diagnosis and handling of multi-master conflicts, BDR, by default, logs every conflict 
into the `bdr.conflict_history` table.
You can change this behavior with more granularity with the following functions.

### bdr.alter_node_set_log_config

Set the conflict logging configuration for a node.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_node_set_log_config(node_name text,
                              log_to_file bool DEFAULT true,
                              log_to_table bool DEFAULT true,
                              conflict_type text[] DEFAULT NULL,
                              conflict_resolution text[] DEFAULT NULL)
```

#### Parameters

-   `node_name` &mdash; Name of the node that's being changed.
-   `log_to_file` &mdash; Whether to log to the server log file.
-   `log_to_table` &mdash; Whether to log to the `bdr.conflict_history` table.
-   `conflict_type` &mdash; Conflict types to log. NULL (the default) means all.
-   `conflict_resolution` &mdash; Conflict resolutions to log. NULL
    (the default) means all.

#### Notes

Only the local node can be changed. The function call isn't
replicated. If you want to change settings on multiple nodes, you must run the function
on each of them.

This function is transactional. You can roll back the changes, and
they are visible to the current transaction.

#### Listing conflict logging configurations

The view `bdr.node_log_config` shows all the logging configurations.
It lists the name of the logging configuration, where it logs, and the
conflict type and resolution it logs.

#### Logging conflicts to a table

Conflicts are logged to a table if `log_to_table` is set to true.
The target table for conflict logging is `bdr.conflict_history`.

This table is range partitioned on the column `local_time`. The table is
managed by Autopartition. By default, a new partition is created for every day, and
conflicts of the last one month are maintained. After that, the old partitions
are dropped automatically. Autopartition creates between 7 and 14
partitions in advance. bdr_superuser can change these defaults.

Since conflicts generated for all tables managed by BDR are logged to this
table, it's important to ensure that only legitimate users can read the
conflicted data. BDR does this by defining ROW LEVEL SECURITY policies on the
`bdr.conflict_history` table. Only owners of the tables are allowed to read conflicts
on the respective tables. If the underlying tables have RLS policies
defined, enabled, and enforced, then even owners can't read the conflicts. RLS
policies created with the FORCE option also apply to owners of the table. In that
case, some or all rows in the underlying table might not be readable even to the
owner. So BDR also enforces a stricter policy on the conflict log table.

The default role `bdr_read_all_conflicts` can be granted to users who
need to see all conflict details logged to the `bdr.conflict_history` table
without also granting them `bdr_superuser` role.

The default role `bdr_read_all_stats` has access to a catalog view called
`bdr.conflict_history_summary`, which doesn't contain user data, allowing
monitoring of any conflicts logged.

### Conflict reporting

Conflicts logged to tables can be summarized in reports. Reports allow
application owners to identify, understand, and resolve conflicts
and introduce application changes to prevent them.

```sql
SELECT nspname, relname
, date_trunc('day', local_time) :: date AS date
, count(*)
FROM bdr.conflict_history
WHERE local_time > date_trunc('day', current_timestamp)
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY 1,2;

 nspname | relname |    date    | count
---------+---------+------------+-------
 my_app  | test    | 2019-04-05 |     1
(1 row)
```

## Data verification with LiveCompare

LiveCompare is a utility program designed
to compare any two databases to verify that they are identical.

LiveCompare is included as part of the BDR stack and can be
aimed at any pair of BDR nodes. By default, it compares all replicated tables and reports differences.
LiveCompare also works with non-BDR data sources such as Postgres
and Oracle.

You can also use LiveCompare to continuously monitor incoming rows.
You can stop and start it without losing context information,
so you can run it at convenient times.

LiveCompare allows concurrent checking of multiple tables. You can
configure it to allow checking of a few tables or just
a section of rows within a table.
Checks are performed by first comparing whole
row hashes. If different, LiveCompare then compares whole rows.
LiveCompare avoids overheads by comparing rows in useful-sized batches.

If differences are found, they can be rechecked over a period,
allowing for the delays of eventual consistency.

Refer to the [LiveCompare](../../livecompare/latest/) documentation for further details.
