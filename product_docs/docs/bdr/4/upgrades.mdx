In this chapter we discuss upgrading software on a BDR cluster and how
to minimize downtime for applications during the upgrade.

## Overview

BDR cluster has two sets of software, the underlying PostgreSQL software
or some flavor of it and the PGLogical/BDR software. We will discuss
upgrading either or both of these softwares versions to their supported
major releases.

To upgrade a BDR cluster, the following steps need to be performed on
each node:

-   plan the upgrade
-   prepare for the upgrade
-   upgrade the server software
-   restart Postgres
-   check and validate the upgrade

## Upgrade Planning

While the BDR 3.7 release supports PostgreSQL 11 - 13, BDR 4.0 supports
PostgreSQL versions 12 - 14. Please refer to (product-matrix.md)
page for the full list compatible software. Since BDR 4.0 supports newer
PostgreSQL releases, while upgrading from BDR 3.7 to BDR 4.0, it's also
recommended to upgrade to a newer PostgreSQL release.

There are broadly two ways to upgrade the BDR version.

-   Upgrading one node at a time to the newer BDR version.
-   Joining a new node running a newer version of the BDR software and
    then optionally drop one of the old nodes.

If you are only interested in upgrading the BDR software, any of the two
methods can be used. But if you also want to upgrade the PostgreSQL
version, then the second method must be used.

!!! Warning
    At this point in time, both of these two methods still have their
    issues and need to be considered beta.  We do not recommend to
    upgrade from BDR 3.7 to BDR 4.0 just yet.  This restriction will
    be lifted in future versions of BDR 4.

### Rolling Server Software Upgrades

A rolling upgrade is the process where the below [Server
Software Upgrade](#Server-Software-Upgrade) is performed on each node in the
BDR Group one after another, while keeping the replication working.

An upgrade to 4.0 is only supported from 3.7 in beta testing mode,
using a specific minimum
maintenance release (e.g. 3.7.15). Please consult the Release Notes
for the actual required minimum version.  So if a node
is running with an older 3.7 release, it must first be upgraded to
the minimum required version and can only then be upgraded to 4.0.

Just as with a single-node database, it's possible to stop all nodes,
perform the upgrade on all nodes and only then restart the entire
cluster.  This strategy of upgrading all nodes at the same time avoids
running with mixed BDR versions and therefore is the simplest, but
obviously incurs some downtime.

During the upgrade process, the application can be switched over to a node
which is currently not being upgraded to provide continuous availability of
the BDR group for applications.

While the cluster is going through a rolling upgrade, replication happens
between mixed versions of BDR. For example, nodeA will have BDR 3.7.11, while
nodeB and nodeC will have 4.0.0. In this state, the replication and group
management will use the protocol and features from the oldest version (3.7.11
in case of this example), so any new features provided by the newer version
which require changes in the protocol will be disabled. Once all nodes are
upgraded to the same version, the new features are automatically enabled.

A BDR cluster is designed to be easily upgradeable. Most BDR releases
support rolling upgrades, which means running part of the cluster on one
release level and the remaining part of the cluster on a second, compatible,
release level.

A rolling upgrade starts with a cluster with all nodes at a prior release,
then proceeds by upgrading one node at a time to the newer release, until
all nodes are at the newer release. Should problems occur, do not attempt
to downgrade without contacting Technical Support to discuss and provide
options.

An upgrade process may take an extended period of time when the user decides
caution is required to reduce business risk, though this should not take any
longer than 30 days without discussion and explicit agreement from Technical
Support to extend the period of coexistence of two release levels.

In case of problems during upgrade, do not initiate a second upgrade to a
newer/different release level. Two upgrades should never occur concurrently
in normal usage. Nodes should never be upgraded to a third release without
specific and explicit instructions from Technical Support. A case where
that might occur is if an upgrade failed for some reason and a Hot Fix was
required to continue the current cluster upgrade process to successful
conclusion. BDR has been designed and tested with more than 2 release
levels, but this cannot be relied upon for production usage except in
specific cases.

### Rolling Upgrade Using Node Join

The other method of upgrading BDR software, along with or without upgrading
the underlying PostgreSQL major version, is to join a new node
to the cluster and later drop one of the existing nodes running
the older version of the software. Even with this method, some features
that are available only in the newer version of the software may remain
unavailable until all nodes are finally upgraded to the newer versions.

A new node running this release of BDR 4.0 can join a 3.7 cluster,
where each node in the cluster is running the latest 3.7.x version of
BDR. The joining node may run any of the supported PostgreSQL versions
12-14 but mixing of PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Extended and EDB Postgres Advanced
is currently not supported.

Care must be taken to not use features that are available only in
the newer PostgreSQL versions, until all nodes are upgraded to the
newer and same release of PostgreSQL. This is especially true for any
new DDL syntax that may have been added to newer release of PostgreSQL.

Note that `bdr_init_physical` makes a byte-by-byte of the source node.
So it cannot be used while upgrading from one major PostgreSQL version
to another. In fact, currently `bdr_init_physical` requires that even
BDR version of the source and the joining node is exactly the same. So
it cannot be used for rolling upgrades via joining a new node method. In
all such cases, a logical join must be used.

### Upgrading a CAMO-Enabled cluster

CAMO protection requires at least one of the nodes of a CAMO pair to
be operational.  For upgrades, we recommend to ensure that no CAMO
protected transactions are running concurrent to the upgrade, or to
use a rolling upgrade strategy, giving the nodes enough time to
reconcile in between the upgrades and the corresponding node downtime
due to the upgrade.

Configuration of CAMO pairs has changed significantly compared to BDR
3.7: instead of GUCs in postgresql.conf, the pairing is now stored in
BDR system catalog `bdr.camo_pairs`.  To upgrade a BDR cluster with
CAMO pairs from 3.7 to 4.0, the following steps need to be performed:

-   Add new upgraded nodes to the cluster in a rolling upgrade fashion.
-   Configure the new CAMO pairs with the `bdr.add_camo_pair()` function.
-   Switch the application to the new nodes.
-   Drop the old nodes.

!!!Note
  `bdr.camo_partner_of` and `bdr.camo_origin_for`  configurations are no
  longer needed in BDR 4.0.

## Upgrade Preparation

Each major release of BDR contains several changes that may affect
compatibility with
previous releases.  These may affect the Postgres configuration,
deployment scripts as well as applications using BDR.  We recommend to
consider and possibly adjust in advance of the upgrade.

### pglogical

There is no pglogical4 and BDR4 will not work if any version of pglogical is
loaded via `shared_preload_libraries` to the same instance of Postgres.

### Node Management

The `bdr.create_node_group()` function has seen a number of changes:

-   It is now possible to create sub-groups, resulting in a tree-of-groups
    structure of the whole BDR cluster. Monitoring views were updated
    accordingly.
-   The deprecated parameters `insert_to_update`, `update_to_insert`,
    `ignore_redundant_updates`, `check_full_tuple` and `apply_delay` were
    removed.
    Use `bdr.alter_node_set_conflict_resolver()` instead of `insert_to_update`,
    `update_to_insert`. The `check_full_tuple` is no longer needed as it is
    handled automatically based on table conflict detection configuration.

### Conflicts

The configuration of conflict resolution and logging is now copied from
join source node to the newly joining node, rather than using defaults on the
new node.

The default conflict resolution for some of the conflict types was changed.
See (conflicts.md#default-conflict-resolvers) for the new defaults.

The conflict logging interfaces have changed from `bdr.alter_node_add_log_config`
and `bdr.alter_node_remove_log_config` to `bdr.alter_node_set_log_config`.

The default conflict logging table is now named `bdr.conflict_history` and the
old `bdr.apply_log` no longer exists. The new table is partitioned using the
Autopartition feature of BDR.

All conflicts are now logged by default to both log file and the conflict
table.

Deprecated functions `bdr.row_version_tracking_enable()` and
`bdr.row_version_tracking_disable()` were removed. Use
`bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection()` instead.

Some of the configuration for conflict handling is no longer stored in
`pglogical` schema. Any diagnostic queries that were using the `pglogical`
tables directly will have to switch to appropriate tables in `bdr` schema.
Queries using `bdr.node_group`, `bdr.local_node_summary`,
`bdr.local_node_summary` or
`bdr.node_local_info` will need to use the new columns `sub_repsets` and
`pub_repsets` instead of `replication_sets`.

### Removed Or Renamed Settings (GUCs)

All the `pglogical.` prefixed configuration variables were renamed to use `bdr.`
prefix instead.

## Server Software Upgrade

The upgrade of BDR software on individual nodes happens in-place. There is no
need for backup and restore when upgrading the BDR extension.
!!!

!!! Warning
    This method cannot be currently used for upgrading BDR 3.7 to 4.0. Only
    way to upgrade 3.7 to 4.0 is to join 4.0 nodes into BDR 3.7 cluster as
    described in [Rolling Upgrade Using Node Join](#rolling_upgrade_using_node_join)
    section. This restriction may be lifted in future versions of BDR 4.

The first step in the upgrade is to install the new version of the BDR packages, which
will install both the new binary and the extension SQL script. This step depends
on the operating system used

### Restart Postgres

Upgrading the binary and extension scripts by itself does not upgrade BDR
in the running instance of PostgreSQL. To do that, the PostgreSQL instance
needs to be restarted so that the new BDR binary can be loaded (the BDR binary
is loaded at the start of the PostgreSQL server). After that, the node is
upgraded. The extension SQL upgrade scripts are executed automatically as
needed.

!!! Warning
    It's important to never run the `ALTER EXTENSION ... UPDATE` command before the
    PostgreSQL instance is restarted, as that will only upgrade the SQL-visible
    extension but keep the old binary, which can cause unpredictable behaviour or
    even crashes. The `ALTER EXTENSION ... UPDATE` command should never be needed;
    BDR4 maintains the SQL-visible extension automatically as needed.

### Upgrade Check and Validation

After this procedure, your BDR node is upgraded. You can verify the current
version of BDR4 binary like this:

```sql
SELECT bdr.bdr_version();
```

Always check the [monitoring](monitoring) after upgrade
of a node to confirm that the upgraded node is working as expected.

## Database Encoding

We recommend using `UTF-8` encoding in all replicated databases.
BDR does not support replication between databases with different
encoding. There is currently no supported path to upgrade/alter encoding.

## Application Schema Upgrades

Similar to the upgrade of BDR itself, there are two approaches to
upgrading the application schema.  The simpler option is to stop all
applications affected, preform the schema upgrade and restart the
application upgraded to use the new schema variant.  Again, this
imposes some downtime.

To eliminate this downtime, BDR offers ways to perform a rolling
application schema upgrade as documented in the following section.

## Rolling Application Schema Upgrades

By default, DDL will automatically be sent to all nodes. This can be
controlled manually, as described in [DDL Replication](ddl), which
could be used to create differences between database schemas across nodes.
BDR is designed to allow replication to continue even while minor
differences exist between nodes. These features are designed to allow
application schema migration without downtime, or to allow logical
standby nodes for reporting or testing.

!!! Warning
    Application Schema Upgrades are managed by the user, not by BDR.
    Careful scripting will be required to make this work correctly
    on production clusters. Extensive testing is advised.

Details of this are covered here
[Replicating between nodes with differences](appusage).

When one node runs DDL that adds a new table, nodes that have not
yet received the latest DDL will need to cope with the extra table.
In view of this, the appropriate setting for rolling schema upgrades
is to configure all nodes to apply the `skip` resolver in case of a
`target_table_missing` conflict. This must be performed before any
node has additional tables added, and is intended to be a permanent
setting.

This is done with the following query, that must be **executed
separately on each node**, after replacing `node1` with the actual
node name:

```sql
SELECT bdr.alter_node_set_conflict_resolver('node1',
		'target_table_missing', 'skip');
```

When one node runs DDL that adds a column to a table, nodes that have not
yet received the latest DDL will need to cope with the extra columns.
In view of this, the appropriate setting for rolling schema
upgrades is to configure all nodes to apply the `ignore` resolver in
case of a `target_column_missing` conflict. This must be performed
before one node has additional columns added and is intended to be a
permanent setting.

This is done with the following query, that must be **executed
separately on each node**, after replacing `node1` with the actual
node name:

```sql
SELECT bdr.alter_node_set_conflict_resolver('node1',
		'target_column_missing', 'ignore');
```

When one node runs DDL that removes a column from a table, nodes that
have not yet received the latest DDL will need to cope with the missing column.
This situation will cause a `source_column_missing` conflict, which uses
the `use_default_value` resolver. Thus, columns that neither
accept NULLs nor have a DEFAULT value will require a two step process:

1.  Remove NOT NULL constraint or add a DEFAULT value for a column
    on all nodes.
2.  Remove the column.

Constraints can be removed in a rolling manner.
There is currently no supported way for coping with adding table
constraints in a rolling manner, one node at a time.

When one node runs a DDL that changes the type of an existing column,
depending on the existence of binary coercibility between the current
type and the target type, the operation may not rewrite the underlying
table data. In that case, it will be only a metadata update of the
underlying column type. Rewrite of a table is normally restricted.
However, in controlled DBA environments, it is possible to change
the type of a column to an automatically castable one by adopting
a rolling upgrade for the type of this column in a non-replicated
environment on all the nodes, one by one. More details are provided in the
[ALTER TABLE](ddl) section.
