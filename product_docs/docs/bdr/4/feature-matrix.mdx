Some features of BDR only work on specific version of Postgres that's capable of
supporting those features. There is also difference in what features work on
PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Extended and EDB Postgres Advanced variants of Postgres.

The following table lists features of BDR and whether they are supported by
given variant of Postgres and optionally from which version.
