title: Eager Replication
---

To prevent conflicts after a commit, set the `bdr.commit_scope`
parameter to `global`. The default setting of `local` disables Eager
Replication, so BDR applies changes and resolves potential conflicts
post-commit, as described in the [Conflicts](conflicts).

In this mode, BDR uses two-phase commit (2PC) internally to detect and
resolve conflicts prior to the local commit. It turns a normal
`COMMIT` of the application into an implicit two-phase commit,
requiring all peer nodes to prepare the transaction before the origin
node continues to commit it. If at least one node is down or
unreachable during the prepare phase, the commit times out after
`bdr.global_commit_timeout`, leading to an abort of the
transaction. There's no restriction on the use of
temporary tables as exists in explicit 2PC in PostgreSQL.

Once prepared, Eager All-Node Replication employs Raft to reach a
commit decision. In case of failures, this allows a remaining
majority of nodes to reach a congruent commit or abort decision so
they can finish the transaction. This unblocks the objects and
resources locked by the transaction and allows the cluster to proceed.

In case all nodes remain operational, the origin confirms the
commit to the client only after all nodes have committed to ensure that the
transaction is immediately visible on all nodes after the commit.

## Requirements

Eager All-Node Replication uses prepared transactions internally.
Therefore all replica nodes need to have a `max_prepared_transactions`
configured high enough to handle all incoming transactions,
possibly in addition to local two-phase commit and CAMO transactions. 
(See [Configuration: Max-prepared transactions](configuration#max-prepared-transactions)).
We recommend configuring it the same on all nodes and high enough to
cover the maximum number of concurrent transactions across the cluster
for which CAMO or Eager All-Node Replication is used. Other than
that, no special configuration is required, and every BDR cluster can
run Eager All-Node transactions.

## Usage

To enable Eager All-Node Replication, the client needs to switch to
global commit scope at session level or for individual transactions
as shown here:

```sql
BEGIN;

... other commands possible...

SET LOCAL bdr.commit_scope = 'global';

... other commands possible...
```

The client can continue to issue a `COMMIT` at the end of the
transaction and let BDR manage the two phases:

```sql
COMMIT;
```

## Error handling

Given that BDR manages the transaction, the client needs to check only the
result of the `COMMIT`. (This is advisable in any case, including single-node
Postgres.)

In case of an origin node failure, the remaining nodes eventually
(after at least `bdr.global_commit_timeout`) decide to roll back the
globally prepared transaction. Raft prevents inconsistent commit versus
rollback decisions. However, this requires a majority of connected
nodes. Disconnected nodes keep the transactions prepared
to eventually commit them (or roll back) as needed to reconcile with the
majority of nodes that might have decided and made further progress.

### Eager All-Node Replication with CAMO

Eager All-Node Replication goes beyond CAMO and implies it. There's no
need to also enable `bdr.enable_camo` if `bdr.commit_scope`
is set to `global`. Nor does a CAMO pair need to be
configured with `bdr.add_camo_pair()`.

You can use any other active BDR node in the role of a CAMO partner to
query a transaction's status. However, you must indicate this non-CAMO usage 
to the `bdr.logical_transaction_status` function with a
third argument of `require_camo_partner = false`. Otherwise, it might
complain about a missing CAMO configuration (which isn't required for
Eager transactions).

Other than this difference in configuration and invocation of that
function, the client needs to adhere to the protocol
described for [CAMO](camo). Reference client implementations are provided to customers on request .

### Limitations

Transactions using Eager Replication can't yet execute DDL,
nor do they support explicit two-phase commit.
These might be allowed in later releases.
The `TRUNCATE` command is allowed.

Replacing a crashed and unrecoverable BDR node with its physical
standby isn't currently supported in combination with Eager All-Node
transactions.

BDR currently offers a global commit scope only. Later releases
will support Eager Replication with fewer nodes for increased
availability.

You can't combine Eager All-Node Replication with
`synchronous_replication_availability = 'async'`. Trying to configure
both causes an error.

The Decoding Worker feature isn't currently supported in combination
with Eager All-Node transactions. Installations using Eager must keep
`enable_wal_decoder` disabled for the BDR node group using Eager All-Node transactions.

Synchronous replication uses a mechanism for transaction confirmation
different from Eager. The two aren't compatible, and you must not use them
together. Therefore, whenever using Eager All-Node transactions,
make sure none of the BDR nodes are configured in
`synchronous_standby_names`. Using synchronous replication to a
non-BDR node acting as a physical standby is possible.

## Effects of Eager Replication in general

#### Increased commit latency

Adding a synchronization step means additional communication between
the nodes, resulting in additional latency at commit time. Eager All-Node 
Replication adds roughly two network roundtrips (to the furthest
peer node in the worst case). Logical standby nodes and nodes still
in the process of joining or catching up aren't included but
eventually receive changes.

Before a peer node can confirm its local preparation of the
transaction, it also needs to apply it locally. This further adds to
the commit latency, depending on the size of the transaction.
This is independent of the `synchronous_commit` setting and
applies whenever `bdr.commit_scope` is set to `global`.

#### Increased abort rate

!!! Note
    The performance of Eager Replication is currently known to be
	unexpectedly slow (around 10 TPS only). This is expected to be
	improved in the next release.

With single-node Postgres, or even with BDR in its default asynchronous
replication mode, errors at `COMMIT` time are rare. The additional
synchronization step adds a source of errors, so applications need to
be prepared to properly handle such errors (usually by applying a
retry loop).

The rate of aborts depends solely on the workload. Large transactions
changing many rows are much more likely to conflict with other
concurrent transactions.
