title: Group Commit
---

The goal of Group Commit is to provide protection against data loss
in case of single node failures or temporary outages. This is achieved
by requiring more than one BDR node to successfully receive and
confirm a transaction at COMMIT time.

## Requirements

During normal operation, Group Commit it completely transparent to the
application.  Upon failover, the reconciliation phase needs to be
explicitly triggered or consolidated by either the application or a
proxy in between.  HARP provides native support for Group Commit and
will trigger the reconciliation phase, making this equally transparent
to the client.

On the origin node, a transaction committed with Group Commit uses
two-phase commit underneath.  Therefore, `max_prepared_transactions`
needs to be configured high enough to handle all such transactions
originating per node.

## Configuration

To use Group Commit, a Commit Scope first needs to be defined.  This
determines the BDR nodes involved in the commit of a transaction.
Once a scope is established, a transaction may be configured to use
Group Commit as follows:

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL bdr.commit_scope = 'example_scope';
...
COMMIT;
```

To complete this example, the Commit Scope in question may previously
have been defined as:

```sql
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'example_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'example_bdr_group',
    rule := 'ANY 2 (example_bdr_group)'
);
```

This assumes a *Node Group* named `example_bdr_group` exists and
includes at least two BDR nodes as members (either directly or in
sub-groups).  Any transaction committed within the `example_scope`
would require one extra confirmation from a BDR node within the group.
Together with the origin node, this accounts for "ANY 2" nodes out of
the group, on which the transaction is guaranteed to be visible and
durable after the commit.

### Origin Groups

Rules for Commit Scopes may depend on which node the transaction is
committed on, i.e. which node acts as the origin for the transaction.
To make this transparent for the application, BDR allows a Commit
Scope to define different rules depending on where the transaction
originates from.

For example, consider a BDR cluster with nodes spread across two data
centers, a left and a right one.  Assume the top-level BDR node group
is called `top_group`.  The following commands may be used to setup
sub-groups and create a Commit Scope requiring all nodes in the local
data center to confirm the transaction, but only one node from the
remote one.

```sql
-- create sub-groups
SELECT bdr.create_node_group(node_group_name := 'left_dc',
                             parent_group_name := 'top_group',
                             join_node_group := false);
SELECT bdr.create_node_group(node_group_name := 'right_dc',
                             parent_group_name := 'top_group',
                             join_node_group := false);

-- create a commit scope with individual rules for each sub-group
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'example_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'left_dc',
    rule := 'ALL (left_dc) AND ANY 1 (right_dc)'
);
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'example_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'right_dc',
    rule := 'ANY 1 (left_dc) AND ALL (right_dc)'
);
```

### Confirmation Levels

BDR nodes can send confirmations for a transaction at different points
in time, similar to [Commit At Most Once](camo.md).  In increasing
levels of protection, from the perspective of the confirming node,
these are:

* `received` - a remote BDR node confirms the transaction immediately
  after having received it, prior to starting local application
* `replicated` - confirm after applying changes of the transaction,
  but before flushing them to disk
* `durable` - confirm the transaction after all of its changes have
  been flushed to disk
* `visible` (default) - confirm the transaction after all of its
  changes have been flushed to disk and it has been made visible to
  concurrent transactions.

In rules for Commit Scopes, these confirmation levels may be appended
to the node group definition (in parenthesis) with `ON` as follows:

* `ANY 1 (right_dc) ON remote_write`
* `ALL (left_dc) ON remote_commit_flush` (default and may as well be
  omitted)
* `ALL (left_dc) ON remote_commit_async AND ANY 1 (right_dc) ON remote_write`

## Reference

### Commit Scope Grammar

For reference, the grammar for commit scopes is as follows:

```
commit_scope: confirmation
              | confirmation AND commit_scope

confirmation: node_def (ON [received|replicated|durable|visible])

node_def:     ANY num (node_group [, ...])
              | MAJORITY (node_group [, ...])
              | ALL (node_group [, ...])
```

### Adding a commit scope rule

The function `bdr.add_commit_scope` creates a rule for the given
commit scope name and origin node group. If the rule is the same for
all nodes in the BDR cluster, invoking this function once for the
top-level node group is sufficient to fully define the commit scope.

Alternatively, it may be invoked multiple times with the same
`commit_scope_name` but different origin node groups and rules for
commit scopes that vary depending on the origin of the transaction.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.add_commit_scope(commit_scope_name NAME, origin_node_group NAME,
                     rule TEXT)
```

### Changing a commit scope rule

To change a specific rule for a single origin node group within a
commit scope, the function `bdr.alter_commit_scope` may be used.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_commit_scope(commit_scope_name NAME, origin_node_group NAME,
                       rule TEXT)
```

### Removing a commit scope rule

The `bdr.remove_commit_scope` can be used to drop a single rule within
a commit scope.  If multiple rules are defined for the commit scope,
this function must be invoked once per rule to fully remove the entire
commit scope.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.remove_commit_scope(commit_scope_name NAME, origin_node_group NAME)
```

## Limitations

Group Commit does not currently work with CAMO or Eager All Node
replication.
