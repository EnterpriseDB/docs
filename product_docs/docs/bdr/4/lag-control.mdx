title: Lag Control
---

Data throughput of database applications on a BDR origin node can
exceed the rate at which committed data can be safely replicated to
downstream peer nodes. If this disparity persists beyond a period of
time, or chronically, in high availability applications then
organizational objectives related to disaster recovery or business
continuity plans may not be satisfied.

The Replication Lag Control (RLC) feature is designed to regulate this
imbalance using a dynamic rate limiting device so that data flow between
BDR group nodes complies with these organizational objectives. It does so
by controlling the extent of replication lag between BDR nodes.

Some of these objectives include the following:

1) Recovery Point Objective (RPC) specifies the maximum tolerated
   amount of data that can be lost due to unplanned events usually
   expressed as an amount of time. In non-replicated systems, RPC
   is used to set backup intervals to limit the risk of lost committed
   data due to failure. For replicated systems, RPC determines the
   acceptable amount of committed data that has not been safely applied
   to one or more peer nodes.

2) Resource Constraint Objective (RCO) acknowledges that there are finite
   storage constraints. This storage includes database files, WAL and
   temporary or intermediate files necessary for continued operation.
   For replicated systems, as lag increases the demands on these storage
   resources also increase.

3) Group Elasticity Objective (GEO) insures that any node is not
   originating new data at a clip that cannot be acceptably saved to
   its peer nodes. When that is the case then the detection of that
   condition may be used as one metric in the decision to expand the
   number of database nodes. Similarly, when that condition abates then
   it may influence the decision to contract the number of database nodes.

Lag Control manages replication lag by controlling the rate at which client
connections may commit READ WRITE transactions. Replication lag is
measured either as lag time or lag size depending on the objectives
to be met. Transaction commit rate is regulated using a configured
BDR commit delay time.

## Requirements

To get started using Lag Control take the following steps:

1) Determine the maximum acceptable commit delay time
   `bdr.lag_control_max_commit_delay` that can be tolerated for all
   database applications.

2) Decide which lag measure is to be used. Either lag size
   `bdr.lag_control_max_lag_size` or lag time `bdr.lag_control_max_lag_time`
   must be chosen.

3) Decide on the number of BDR nodes in the group
   `bdr.lag_control_min_conforming_nodes` that must satisfy the lag
   measure chosen in step 2) as the minimal acceptable number of nodes.

## Configuration

Lag Control is configured on each BDR node in the group using `postgresql.conf`
configuration parameters. For Lag Control to be enabled,
`bdr.lag_control_max_commit_delay` and either `bdr.lag_control_max_lag_size` or
`bdr.lag_control_max_lag_time` must be set to positive non-zero values.

`bdr.lag_control_max_commit_delay` allows, and encourages, a specification
of milliseconds with a fractional part including a sub-millisecond
setting if appropriate.

By default, `bdr.lag_control_min_conforming_nodes` is set to one (1).
For a complete list, see [Lag Control](configuration.md)

## Overview

Lag Control is a dynamic TPS rate limiting mechanism that operates at the client
connection level. It is designed to be as unobtrusive as possible while
satisfying configured lag control constraints. This means that if enough
BDR nodes can replicate changes fast enough to remain below configured
lag measure thresholds then the BDR runtime commit delay will stay fixed
at 0 milliseconds.

If this is not the case, the BDR runtime commit delay will be minimally
adjusted as high as necessary, but no higher, until the number of
conforming nodes is returned to the minimum threshold.

Even after the minimum node threshold is reached, Lag Control continues to attempt
to drive the BDR runtime commit delay back to zero. The BDR commit delay
may rise and fall around an equilibrium level most of the time, but if
data throughput or lag apply rates improve then the commit delay will
decrease over time.

The BDR commit delay is a post commit delay. It occurs after the transaction
has committed and after all Postgres resources locked or acquired by the
transaction have been released. Therefore, the delay does not prevent
concurrent active transactions from observing or modifying its values nor
acquiring its resources. The same guarantee cannot be made for external
resources managed by Postgres extensions. Notwithstanding extension
dependencies, the same guarantee can be made if the BDR extension is listed
before extension-based resource managers in `postgresql.conf`.

Strictly speaking, the BDR commit delay is not a per transaction delay.
It is the mean value of commit delays over a stream of transactions for a
particular client connection. This technique allows the commit delay and
fine-grained adjustments of the value to escape the coarse granularity of
OS schedulers, clock interrupts and variation due to system load. It also
allows the BDR runtime commit delay to settle within microseconds of the
lowest duration possible to maintain a lag measure threshold.

Finally, the BDR commit delay should not be conflated with the Postgres
commit delay; they are unrelated, perform different functions and should
not be substituted for each other.

## Transaction Application

The BDR commit delay is applied to all READ WRITE transactions that
modify data for user applications. This implies that any transaction
that does not modify data, including declared READ WRITE transactions,
is exempt from the commit delay.

Asynchronous transaction commit also executes a BDR commit delay. This
may appear counterintuitive, but asynchronous commit, by virtue of its
performance, can be one of the greatest sources of replication lag.

Postgres and BDR auxillary processes do not delay at transaction commit.
Most notably, BDR writers do not execute a commit delay when applying
remote transactions on the local node. This is by design as BDR writers
contribute nothing to outgoing replication lag and can reduce incoming
replication lag the most by not having their transaction commits throttled
by a delay.

## Limitations

The maximum commit delay `bdr.lag_control_max_commit_delay` is a ceiling
value representing a hard limit. This means that under no circumstance
does a commit delay ever exceed the configured value. Conversely, the
maximum lag measures `bdr.lag_control_max_lag_size` and
`bdr.lag_control_max_lag_time` are soft limits that can be exceeded.
When the maximum commit delay is reached, there exists no additional
back-pressure on the lag measures to prevent their continued increase.

There is no way to exempt origin transactions that do not modify BDR
replication sets from the commit delay. For these transactions, it
may be useful to SET LOCAL the maximum transaction delay to zero (0).

## Caveats

Application TPS is one of many factors that can affect replication lag.
Other factors include the average size of transactions for which BDR commit
delay can be less efficacious. In particular, bulk load operations can
cause replication lag to rise, which can trigger a concomitant rise in
the BDR runtime commit delay beyond the level reasonably expected by normal
applications although still under the maximum allowed delay.

Similarly, an application with a very high OLTP requirement and modest
data changes could be unduly restrained by the acceptable BDR commit delay
setting.

In these cases, it may be useful to use `SET [SESSION|LOCAL]` command to
custom configure Lag Control settings for those applications or modify
those applications. For example, bulk load operations are sometimes split
into multiple, smaller transactions to limit transaction snapshot duration
and WAL retention size or establish a restart point if the bulk load fails.
In a bow to lag control, those transaction commits can also schedule very
long BDR commit delays to allow digestion of the lag contributed by the
prior partial bulk load.

## Meeting Organizational Objectives

In the example objectives list earlier:

-   RPO can be met by setting an appropriate maximum lag time;
-   RCO can be met by setting an appropriate maximum lag size;
-   GEO can be met by monitoring the BDR runtime commit delay
    and the BDR runtime lag measures.

    As mentioned, when the maximum BDR runtime commit delay is
    pegged at the BDR configured commit delay limit and the lag
    measures consistency exceed their BDR configured maximum
    levels, it can be a marker for BDR group expansion.
