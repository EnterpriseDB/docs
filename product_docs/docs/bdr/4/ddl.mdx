title: DDL replication


---

DDL stands for data definition language, the subset of the SQL
language that creates, alters, and drops database objects.

For operational convenience and correctness, BDR replicates most DDL
actions, with these exceptions:

-   Temporary or unlogged relations
-   Certain DDL statements (mostly long running ); See [DDL statements with restrictions](#ddl-statements-with-restrictions))
-   Locking commands (`LOCK`)
-   Table maintenance commands (`VACUUM`, `ANALYZE`, `CLUSTER`, `REINDEX`)
-   Actions of autovacuum
-   Operational commands (`CHECKPOINT`, `ALTER SYSTEM`)
-   Actions related to databases or tablespaces

Automatic DDL replication makes 
certain DDL changes easier without having to manually distribute
the DDL change to all nodes and ensure that they are consistent.

In the default replication set, DDL is replicated to all nodes by default.
To replicate DDL, you must add a DDL replication filter to the
replication set. See [DDL replication filtering](#ddr-replication-filtering).

BDR is significantly different from standalone PostgreSQL when it
comes to DDL replication. Treating it the same is the most
common issue with BDR.

The main difference from table replication is that DDL replication doesn't
replicate the result of the DDL but the statement itself. This works
very well in most cases, although it introduces the requirement that the DDL
must execute similarly on all nodes. A more subtle point is that the DDL
must be immutable with respect to all datatype-specific parameter settings,
including any datatypes introduced by extensions (not built-in).
For example, the DDL statement must execute correctly in the default
encoding used on each node.

## DDL replication options

The `bdr.ddl_replication` parameter specifies replication behavior.

`bdr.ddl_replication = on` is the default and replicates DDL to the
default replication set, which by default means all nodes. Nondefault
replication sets don't replicate DDL unless they have a
[DDL filter](repsets)
defined for them.

You can also replicate DDL to specific replication sets using the
function `bdr.replicate_ddl_command()`. This can be helpful if you
want to run DDL commands when a node is down or if you want to have
indexes or partitions that exist on a subset of nodes or rep sets,
for example, all nodes at site1.

```
SELECT bdr.replicate_ddl_command(
				'CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ON foo (col7);',
				ARRAY['site1'],     -- the replication sets
                'on');              -- ddl_locking to apply
```

While we don't recommend it, you can skip automatic DDL replication and
execute it manually on each node using `bdr.ddl_replication` configuration
parameters.

```
SET bdr.ddl_replication = off;
```

When set, it makes BDR skip both the global locking and the replication
of executed DDL commands. You must then run the DDL manually on all nodes.

!!! Warning
    Executing DDL manually on each node without global locking can
    cause the whole BDR group to stop replicating if conflicting DDL or DML
    executes concurrently.

The `bdr.ddl_replication` parameter can be set only by the bdr_superuser,
by superuser, or in the `config` file.

## Executing DDL on BDR systems

A BDR group isn't the same as a standalone PostgreSQL server. It's
based on asynchronous multi-master replication without central
locking and without a transaction coordinator. This has important implications
when executing DDL.

DDL that executes in parallel continues to do so with BDR. DDL execution
respects the parameters that affect parallel operation on each node as it
executes, so you might notice differences in the settings between nodes.

Prevent the execution of conflicting DDL, otherwise DDL replication
causes errors and the replication stops.

BDR offers three levels of protection against those problems:

`ddl_locking = 'dml'` is the best option for operations, usable when you execute
DDL from only one node at a time. This isn't the default, but we recommend
that you use this setting if you can control where DDL is executed from. Doing so
ensures that there are no inter-node conflicts. Intra-node conflicts are already
handled by PostgreSQL.

`ddl_locking = on` is the strictest option and is best when DDL might execute
from any node concurrently and you want to ensure correctness.

`ddl_locking = off` is the least strict option and is dangerous in general use.
This option skips locks altogether, avoiding any performance overhead, which makes
it a useful option when creating a new and empty database schema.

These options can be set only by the bdr_superuser, by the superuser, or in the `config file`.

When using the `bdr.replicate_ddl_command`, you can set this
parameter directly with the third argument, using the specified
`bdr.ddl_locking` setting only for the DDL commands passed to that
function.

## DDL locking details

Two kinds of locks enforce correctness of replicated DDL with BDR.

The first kind is known as a global DDL lock and is used only when `ddl_locking = on`.
A global DDL lock prevents any other DDL from executing on the cluster while
each DDL statement runs. This ensures full correctness in the general case but
is too strict for many simple cases. BDR acquires a global lock on
DDL operations the first time in a transaction where schema changes are made.
This effectively serializes the DDL-executing transactions in the cluster. In
other words, while DDL is running, no other connection on any node can run
another DDL command, even if it affects different tables.

To acquire a lock on DDL operations, the BDR node executing DDL contacts the
other nodes in a BDR group and asks them to grant it the exclusive right to
execute DDL. The lock request is sent by the regular replication stream, and the
nodes respond by the replication stream as well. So it's important that nodes (or
at least a majority of the nodes) run without much replication
delay. Otherwise it might take a long time for the node to acquire the DDL
lock. Once the majority of nodes agrees, the DDL execution is carried out.

The ordering of DDL locking is decided using the Raft protocol. DDL statements
executed on one node are executed in the same sequence on all other nodes.

To ensure that the node running a DDL has seen effects of all prior
DDLs run in the cluster, it waits until it has caught up with the node that
ran the previous DDL. If the node running the current DDL is lagging behind in
replication with respect to the node that ran the previous DDL, then it might
take a long time to acquire the lock. Hence it's preferable to run DDLs from a
single node or the nodes that have nearly caught up with replication changes
originating at other nodes.

The second kind is known as a relation DML lock. This kind of lock is used when
either `ddl_locking = on` or `ddl_locking = dml`, and the DDL statement might cause
in-flight DML statements to fail. These failures can occur when you add or modify a constraint
such as a unique constraint, check constraint, or NOT NULL constraint.
Relation DML locks affect only one relation at a time. Relation DML
locks ensure that no DDL executes while there are changes in the queue that
might cause replication to halt with an error.

To acquire the global DML lock on a table, the BDR node executing the DDL
contacts all other nodes in a BDR group, asking them to lock the table
against writes and waiting while all pending changes to that table are drained.
Once all nodes are fully caught up, the originator of the DML lock is free
to perform schema changes to the table and replicate them to the other nodes.

The global DML lock holds an EXCLUSIVE LOCK on the table on each node,
so it blocks DML, other DDL, VACUUM, and index commands against that table while
it runs. This is true even if the global DML lock is held for a command that
normally doesn't take an EXCLUSIVE LOCK or higher.

Waiting for pending DML operations to drain can take a long time and even longer
if replication is currently lagging.
This means that schema changes affecting row representation and constraints,
unlike with data changes, can be performed only while all configured nodes
can be reached and are keeping up reasonably well with the current write rate.
If such DDL commands must be performed while a node is down, first remove the
down node from the configuration.

If a DDL statement isn't replicated, no global locks are acquired.

Locking behavior is specified by the `bdr.ddl_locking` parameter, as
explained in [Executing DDL on BDR systems](#executing-ddl-on-bdr-systems):

-   `ddl_locking = on` takes global DDL lock and, if needed, takes relation DML lock.
-   `ddl_locking = dml` skips global DDL lock and, if needed, takes relation DML lock.
-   `ddl_locking = off` skips both global DDL lock and relation DML lock.

Some BDR functions make DDL changes. For those functions,
DDL locking behavior applies. This is noted in the docs for each function.

Thus, `ddl_locking = dml` is safe only when you can guarantee that
no conflicting DDL is executed from other nodes. With this setting,
the statements that require only the global DDL lock don't use the global
locking at all.

`ddl_locking = off` is safe only when you can guarantee that there are no
conflicting DDL and no conflicting DML operations on the database objects
DDL executes on. If you turn locking off and then experience difficulties,
you might lose in-flight changes to data. The user application team needs to resolve any issues caused.

In some cases, concurrently executing DDL can properly be serialized.
If these serialization failures occur, the DDL might reexecute.

DDL replication isn't active on logical standby nodes until they are promoted.

Some BDR management functions act like DDL, meaning that they
attempt to take global locks, and their actions are replicated if DDL
replication is active. The full list of replicated functions is listed in
[BDR functions that behave like DDL](#bdr-functions-that-behave-like-ddl).

DDL executed on temporary tables never need global locks.

ALTER or DROP of an object created in the current transaction doesn't required
global DML lock.

Monitoring of global DDL locks and global DML locks is shown in
[Monitoring](/pgd/latest/monitoring).

## Minimizing the impact of DDL

Good operational advice for any database, these points become even more
important with BDR:

-   To minimize the impact of DDL, make transactions performing DDL short,
    don't combine them with lots of row changes, and avoid long
    running foreign key or other constraint rechecks.

-   For `ALTER TABLE`, use `ADD CONSTRAINT NOT VALID` followed by another
    transaction with `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` rather than using `ADD CONSTRAINT` alone.
    `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` waits until replayed on all nodes, which
    gives a noticeable delay to receive confirmations.

-   When indexing, use the `CONCURRENTLY` option whenever possible.

An alternate way of executing long-running DDL is to disable DDL replication
and then to execute the DDL statement separately on each node. You can 
still do this using a single SQL statement, as shown in the following example.
Global locking rules still apply, so be careful not to lock
yourself out with this type of usage, which is more of a
workaround.

```sql
SELECT bdr.run_on_all_nodes($ddl$
        CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY index_a ON table_a(i);
$ddl$);
```

We recommend using the `bdr.run_on_all_nodes()` technique with `CREATE
INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, noting that DDL replication must be disabled for the whole
session because `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` is a multi-transaction command.
Avoid `CREATE INDEX` on production systems
since it prevents writes while it executes.
`REINDEX` is replicated in versions up to 3.6 but not with BDR 3.7 or later.
Avoid using `REINDEX` because of the AccessExclusiveLocks it holds.

Instead, use `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` (or `reindexdb --concurrently`),
which is available in PG12+ or 2QPG11+.

You can disable DDL replication when using command-line utilities like this:

```sql
$ export PGOPTIONS="-c bdr.ddl_replication=off"
$ pg_restore --section=post-data
```

Multiple DDL statements might benefit from bunching into a single transaction
rather than fired as individual statements, so take the DDL lock 
only once. This might not be desirable if the table-level locks interfere with
normal operations.

If DDL is holding up the system for too long, you can safely
cancel the DDL on the originating node with `Control-C` in psql or with `pg_cancel_backend()`.
You can't cancel a DDL lock from any other node.

You can control how long the global lock takes with optional
global locking timeout settings.
`bdr.global_lock_timeout` limits how long the wait
for acquiring the global lock can take before it's canceled.
`bdr.global_lock_statement_timeout` limits the runtime length of any statement
in transaction that holds global locks, and `bdr.global_lock_idle_timeout`
sets the maximum allowed idle time (time between statements) for a transaction
holding any global locks. You can disable all of these timeouts by setting
their values to zero.

Once the DDL operation has committed on the originating node, you can't cancel or abort it. 
The BDR group must wait for it to apply successfully on
other nodes that confirmed the global lock and for them to acknowledge replay.
For this reason, keep DDL transactions short and fast.

## Handling DDL with down nodes

If the node initiating the global DDL lock goes down after it acquired
the global lock (either DDL or DML), the lock stays active.
The global locks don't time out, even if timeouts were set.
In case the node comes back up, it releases all the global
locks that it holds.

If it stays down for a long time (or indefinitely),
remove the node from the BDR group to release the global locks. This
is one reason for executing emergency DDL using the `SET` command as
the bdr_superuser to update the `bdr.ddl_locking` value.

If one of the other nodes goes down after it confirmed the global lock
but before the command acquiring it executed, the execution of
that command requesting the lock continues as if the node were up.

As mentioned earlier, the global DDL lock requires only a majority of
the nodes to respond, and so it works if part of the cluster is down, as long as a
majority is running and reachable. But the DML lock can't be acquired
unless the whole cluster is available.

With global DDL or global DML lock, if another node goes down, the
command continues normally, and the lock is released.

## Statement-specific DDL replication concerns

Not all commands can be replicated automatically. Such commands
are generally disallowed, unless DDL replication is turned off
by turning `bdr.ddl_replication` off.

BDR prevents some DDL statements from running when it's active on a
database. This protects the consistency of the system by disallowing
statements that can't be replicated correctly or for which replication
isn't yet supported. Statements that are supported with some restrictions
are covered in [DDL statements with restrictions](#ddl-statements-with-restrictions). Commands that are
entirely disallowed in BDR are covered in prohibited DDL statements.

If a statement isn't permitted under BDR, you can often find
another way to do the same thing. For example, you can't do an `ALTER TABLE`,
which adds a column with a volatile default value. But generally you can
rephrase that as a series of independent `ALTER TABLE` and `UPDATE` statements
that work.

Generally unsupported statements are prevented from being
executed, raising a `feature_not_supported` (SQLSTATE `0A000`) error.

Any DDL that references or relies on a temporary object can't
be replicated by BDR and throws an error if executed with DDL replication
enabled.

## BDR DDL command handling matrix

The following table describes the utility or DDL commands that are allowed, the ones that
are replicated, and the type of global lock they take when they're replicated.

For some more complex statements like `ALTER TABLE`, these can differ depending
on the subcommands executed. Every such command has detailed explanation
under the following table.

### ALTER SEQUENCE

Generally `ALTER SEQUENCE` is supported, but when using global
sequences, some options have no effect.

`ALTER SEQUENCE ... RENAME` isn't supported on galloc sequences (only).
`ALTER SEQUENCE ... SET SCHEMA` isn't supported on galloc sequences (only).

### ALTER TABLE

Generally, `ALTER TABLE` commands are allowed. However, several
subcommands aren't supported.

<div id='bdr_ddl_allowed_AlterTableStmt'></div>

#### ALTER TABLE disallowed commands

Some variants of `ALTER TABLE` currently aren't allowed on a BDR node:

-   `ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT (non-immutable expression)` &mdash; This is not allowed because
    it currently results in different data on different nodes. See
    [Adding a column](#adding-a-column) for a suggested workaround.
-   `ADD CONSTRAINT ... EXCLUDE` &mdash; Exclusion constraints aren't supported for now.
    Exclusion constraints don't make much sense in an asynchronous system and
    lead to changes that can't be replayed.
-   `ALTER TABLE ... SET WITH[OUT] OIDS` &mdash; Isn't supported for the same reasons
    as in `CREATE TABLE`.
-   `ALTER COLUMN ... SET STORAGE external` &mdash; Is rejected if the column is
    one of the columns of the replica identity for the table.
-   `RENAME` &mdash; Can't rename an Autopartitioned table.
-   `SET SCHEMA` &mdash; Can't set the schema of an Autopartitioned table.
-   `ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE` &mdash; Changing a column's type isn't supported if the
    command causes the whole table to be rewritten, which occurs when the change
    isn't binary coercible.
    Binary coercible changes might be allowed only one way. For example,
    the change from `VARCHAR(128)` to `VARCHAR(256)` is binary coercible and therefore
    allowed, whereas the change `VARCHAR(256)` to `VARCHAR(128)` isn't binary coercible
    and therefore normally disallowed. Nonreplicated `ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE`,
    can be allowed if the column is automatically castable to the new type
    (it doesn't contain the `USING` clause). An example follows.
    Table rewrites hold an
    AccessExclusiveLock for extended periods on larger tables, so such commands
    are likely to be infeasible on highly available databases in any case.
    See [Changing a column's type](#changing-a-columns-type) for a suggested workaround.
-   `ALTER TABLE ... ADD FOREIGN KEY` &mdash; Isn't supported if current user doesn't have
    permission to read the referenced table or if the referenced table
    has RLS restrictions enabled that the current user can't bypass.

The following example fails because it tries to add a constant value of type `timestamp`
onto a column of type `timestamptz`. The cast between `timestamp` and `timestamptz`
relies on the time zone of the session and so isn't immutable.

```sql
ALTER TABLE foo
  ADD expiry_date timestamptz DEFAULT timestamp '2100-01-01 00:00:00' NOT NULL;
```

Starting in BDR 3.7.4, you can add certain types of constraints, such as `CHECK` and
`FOREIGN KEY` constraints, without taking a DML lock. But
this requires a two-step process of first creating a `NOT VALID` constraint
and then validating the constraint in a separate transaction with the `ALTER TABLE ... VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` 
command. See [Adding a CONSTRAINT](#adding-a-constraint)
for more details.

<div id='bdr_ddl_lock_relation_AlterTableStmt'></div>

#### ALTER TABLE locking

The following variants of `ALTER TABLE` take only DDL lock and not a
DML lock:

-   `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... (immutable) DEFAULT`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET DEFAULT expression`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... DROP DEFAULT`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE` if it doesn't require rewrite
-   `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET STATISTICS`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... VALIDATE CONSTRAINT`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... ATTACH PARTITION`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE TRIGGER` (`ENABLE REPLICA TRIGGER` still takes a DML lock)
-   `ALTER TABLE ... CLUSTER ON`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... SET WITHOUT CLUSTER`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... SET ( storage_parameter = value [, ... ] )`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... RESET ( storage_parameter = [, ... ] )`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... OWNER TO`

All other variants of `ALTER TABLE` take a DML lock on the table being modified.
Some variants of `ALTER TABLE` have restrictions, noted below.

#### ALTER TABLE examples

This next example works because the type change is binary coercible and so doesn't
cause a table rewrite. It executes as a catalog-only change.

```sql
CREATE TABLE foo (id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY, description VARCHAR(20));
ALTER TABLE foo ALTER COLUMN description TYPE VARCHAR(128);
```

However, making this change to reverse the command isn't possible because
the change from `VARCHAR(128)` to `VARCHAR(20)` isn't binary coercible.

```sql
ALTER TABLE foo ALTER COLUMN description TYPE VARCHAR(20);
```

For workarounds, see [Restricted DDL workarounds](restricted-ddl-workarounds).

It's useful to provide context for different types of `ALTER TABLE ...
ALTER COLUMN TYPE` (ATCT) operations that are possible in general and in
nonreplicated environments.

Some ATCT operations update only the metadata of the underlying column
type and don't require a rewrite of the underlying table data. This is
typically the case when the existing column type and the target type are
binary coercible. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sample (col1 BIGINT PRIMARY KEY, col2 VARCHAR(128), col3 INT);
ALTER TABLE sample ALTER COLUMN col2 TYPE VARCHAR(256);
```

You can also change the column type to `VARCHAR` or `TEXT`
data types because of binary coercibility. Again, this is just a metadata
update of the underlying column type.

```sql
ALTER TABLE sample ALTER COLUMN col2 TYPE VARCHAR;
ALTER TABLE sample ALTER COLUMN col2 TYPE TEXT;
```

However, if you want to reduce the size of col2, then that leads to
a rewrite of the underlying table data. Rewrite of a table is normally
restricted.

```sql
ALTER TABLE sample ALTER COLUMN col2 TYPE VARCHAR(64);
ERROR:  ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN TYPE that rewrites table data may not affect replicated tables on a BDR node
```

To give an example with nontext types, consider col3 above with type
INTEGER. An ATCT operation that tries to convert to SMALLINT or BIGINT 
fails in a similar manner as above.

```sql
ALTER TABLE sample ALTER COLUMN col3 TYPE bigint;
ERROR:  ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN TYPE that rewrites table data may not affect replicated tables on a BDR node
```

In both of these failing cases, there's an automatic assignment
cast from the current types to the target types. However, there's no
binary coercibility, which ends up causing a rewrite of the underlying
table data.

In such cases, in controlled DBA environments, you can change
the type of a column to an automatically castable one by adopting
a rolling upgrade for the type of this column in a nonreplicated
environment on all the nodes, one by one. Suppose the DDL isn't replicated
and the change of the column type is to an automatically castable one. 
You can then allow the rewrite locally on the node
performing the alter, along with concurrent activity on other nodes on
this same table. You can then repeat this nonreplicated ATCT operation
on all the nodes one by one to bring about the desired change of the
column type across the entire BDR cluster. Because this
involves a rewrite, the activity still takes the DML lock for a
brief period and thus requires that the whole cluster is available. With
these specifics in place, you can carry out the rolling upgrade of the nonreplicated
alter activity like this:

```sql
-- foreach node in BDR cluster do:
SET bdr.ddl_replication TO FALSE;
ALTER TABLE sample ALTER COLUMN col2 TYPE VARCHAR(64);
ALTER TABLE sample ALTER COLUMN col3 TYPE BIGINT;
RESET bdr.ddl_replication;
-- done
```

Due to automatic assignment casts being available for many data types,
this local nonreplicated ATCT operation supports a wide variety of
conversions. Also, ATCT operations that use a `USING` clause
are likely to fail because of the lack of automatic assignment casts.
This example shows a few common conversions with automatic assignment casts:

```sql
-- foreach node in BDR cluster do:
SET bdr.ddl_replication TO FALSE;
ATCT operations to-from {INTEGER, SMALLINT, BIGINT}
ATCT operations to-from {CHAR(n), VARCHAR(n), VARCHAR, TEXT}
ATCT operations from numeric types to text types
RESET bdr.ddl_replication;
-- done
```

This example isn't an exhaustive list of possibly allowable ATCT
operations in a nonreplicated environment. Not all ATCT
operations work. The cases where no automatic assignment is
possible fail even if you disable DDL replication. So, while
conversion from numeric types to text types works in a nonreplicated
environment, conversion back from text type to numeric types fails.

```sql
SET bdr.ddl_replication TO FALSE;
-- conversion from BIGINT to TEXT works
ALTER TABLE sample ALTER COLUMN col3 TYPE TEXT;
-- conversion from TEXT back to BIGINT fails
ALTER TABLE sample ALTER COLUMN col3 TYPE BIGINT;
ERROR:  ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN TYPE which cannot be automatically cast to new type may not affect replicated tables on a BDR node
RESET bdr.ddl_replication;
```

While the ATCT operations in nonreplicated environments support a
variety of type conversions, the rewrite
can still fail if the underlying table data contains values that you can't
assign to the new data type. For example, suppose the current type for
a column is `VARCHAR(256)` and you try a nonreplicated ATCT
operation to convert it into `VARCHAR(128)`. If there's any existing data
in the table that's wider than 128 bytes, then the rewrite operation
fails locally.

```sql
INSERT INTO sample VALUES (1, repeat('a', 200), 10);
SET bdr.ddl_replication TO FALSE;
ALTER TABLE sample ALTER COLUMN col2 TYPE VARCHAR(128);
INFO:  in rewrite
ERROR:  value too long for type character varying(128)
```

If underlying table data meets the characteristics of the new type,
then the rewrite succeeds. However,
replication might fail if other nodes that haven't yet performed the
nonreplicated rolling data type upgrade introduce new data that
is wider than 128 bytes concurrently to this local ATCT operation. This
brings replication to a halt in the cluster. So 
be aware of the data type restrictions and characteristics at the
database and application levels while performing these
nonreplicated rolling data type upgrade operations. We strongly
recommend that you perform and test such ATCT operations in
controlled and fully aware DBA environments. These
ATCT operations are asymmetric, and backing out certain changes that fail
can lead to table rewrites that take a long time.

Also, you can't perform the implicit castable ALTER activity in transaction blocks.

### ALTER TYPE

`ALTER TYPE` is replicated, but a global DML lock isn't
applied to all tables that use that data type, since PostgreSQL doesn't
record those dependencies. See [Restricted DDL workarounds](restricted-ddl-workarounds).

<div id='bdr_ddl_can_replicate_comment'></div>

### COMMENT ON

All variants of `COMMENT ON` are allowed, but
`COMMENT ON TABLESPACE/DATABASE/LARGE OBJECT` isn't replicated.

<div id='bdr_ddl_allowed_CreateSeqStmt'></div>

### CREATE SEQUENCE

Generally `CREATE SEQUENCE` is supported, but when using global
sequences, some options have no effect.

<div id='bdr_ddl_allowed_CreateStmt'></div>

### CREATE TABLE

Generally `CREATE TABLE` is supported, but `CREATE TABLE WITH OIDS` isn't
allowed on a BDR node.

<div id='bdr_ddl_allowed_CreateTableAsStmt'></div>

### CREATE TABLE AS and SELECT INTO

`CREATE TABLE AS` and `SELECT INTO` are allowed only if all subcommands are
also allowed.

### EXPLAIN

Generally `EXPLAIN` is allowed, but because `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` can have side
effects on the database, there are some restrictions on it.

<div id='bdr_ddl_can_replicate_explain'></div>

#### EXPLAIN ANALYZE Replication

`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` follows replication rules of the analyzed statement.

<div id='bdr_ddl_lock_explain_stmt'></div>

#### EXPLAIN ANALYZE Locking

`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` follows locking rules of the analyzed statement.

<div id='bdr_ddl_can_replicate_grant'></div>

### GRANT and REVOKE

Generally `GRANT` and `REVOKE` statements are supported, however
`GRANT/REVOKE ON TABLESPACE/LARGE OBJECT` aren't replicated.

<div id='bdr_ddl_lock_lock_stmt'></div>

### LOCK TABLE

LOCK TABLE isn't replicated, but it might acquire the global DML lock when
`bdr.lock_table_locking` is set `on`.

You can also use The `bdr.global_lock_table()` function to explicitly request a global DML
lock.

<div id='bdr_ddl_can_replicate_seclabel'></div>

### SECURITY LABEL

All variants of `SECURITY LABEL` are allowed, but
`SECURITY LABEL ON TABLESPACE/DATABASE/LARGE OBJECT` isn't replicated.

<div id='bdr_ddl_can_replicate_truncate'></div>

### TRUNCATE Replication

`TRUNCATE` command is replicated as DML, not as a DDL statement. Whether
the `TRUNCATE` on table is replicated depends on replication settings for
each affected table.

<div id='bdr_ddl_lock_truncate_stmt'></div>

### TRUNCATE Locking

Even though `TRUNCATE` isn't replicated the same way as other DDL, it can acquire
the global DML lock when `bdr.truncate_locking` is set to `on`.

### Role manipulation statements

Users are global objects in a PostgreSQL instance, which means they span
multiple databases while BDR operates on an individual database level. This means
that role manipulation statement handling needs extra thought.

BDR requires that any roles that are referenced by any replicated DDL must
exist on all nodes. The roles don't have to have the same grants,
password, and so on, but they must exist.

BDR replicates role manipulation statements if `bdr.role_replication` is
enabled (default) and role manipulation statements are run in a BDR-enabled
database.

The role manipulation statements include the following:

-   `CREATE ROLE`
-   `ALTER ROLE`
-   `DROP ROLE`
-   `GRANT ROLE`
-   `CREATE USER`
-   `ALTER USER`
-   `DROP USER`
-   `CREATE GROUP`
-   `ALTER GROUP`
-   `DROP GROUP`

In general, either:

-   Configure the system with `bdr.role_replication = off` and
    deploy all role changes (user and group) by external orchestration
    tools like Ansible, Puppet, and Chef or explicitly replicated by
    `bdr.replicate_ddl_command(...)`.

-   Configure the system so that exactly one BDR-enabled database
    on the PostgreSQL instance has `bdr.role_replication = on` and run all
    role management DDL on that database.

We recommended that you run all role management commands in one
database.

If role replication is turned off, then the administrator must ensure that
any roles used by DDL on one node also exist on the other nodes. Otherwise BDR apply
stalls with an error until the role is created on the other nodes.

!!! Note 
    BDR doesn't capture and replicate role management statements when they
    run on a non-BDR-enabled database in a BDR-enabled PostgreSQL instance.
    For example, if you have DBs 'bdrdb' (bdr group member) and 'postgres' (bare db),
    and `bdr.role_replication = on`, then a `CREATE USER` run in `bdrdb` is
    replicated, but a `CREATE USER` run in `postgres` isn't.

### Restricted DDL workarounds

Some of the limitations of BDR DDL operation handling can be worked around.
Often splitting up the operation into smaller changes can produce the desired
result that either isn't allowed as a single statement or requires excessive
locking.

#### Adding a CONSTRAINT

You can add `CHECK` and `FOREIGN KEY` constraints without requiring a DML lock.
This involves a two-step process.

-   `ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ... NOT VALID`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... VALIDATE CONSTRAINT`

Execute these steps in two different transactions. Both these
steps take DDL lock only on the table and hence can be run even when one
or more nodes are down. But to validate a constraint, BDR must
ensure that:
-  All nodes in the cluster see the `ADD CONSTRAINT` command. 
-  The node validating the constraint applied replication changes from all other nodes prior to 
    creating the NOT VALID constraint on those nodes. 

So even though the new mechanism doesn't need all nodes
to be up while validating the constraint, it still requires that all
nodes applied the `ALTER TABLE .. ADD CONSTRAINT ... NOT VALID`
command and made enough progress. BDR waits for a consistent
state to be reached before validating the constraint.

The new facility requires the cluster to run with Raft protocol
version 24 and beyond. If the Raft protocol isn't yet upgraded, the old
mechanism is used, resulting in a DML lock request.

#### Adding a column

To add a column with a volatile default, run these commands in
separate transactions:

```sql
    ALTER TABLE mytable ADD COLUMN newcolumn coltype; -- Note the lack of DEFAULT or NOT NULL

    ALTER TABLE mytable ALTER COLUMN newcolumn DEFAULT volatile-expression;

	BEGIN;
	SELECT bdr.global_lock_table('mytable');
    UPDATE mytable SET newcolumn = default-expression;
	COMMIT;
```

This approach splits schema changes and row changes into separate transactions that
BDR can execute and results in consistent data across all nodes in a
BDR group.

For best results, batch the update into chunks so that you don't update more than
a few tens or hundreds of thousands of rows at once. You can do this using
a `PROCEDURE` with embedded transactions.

The last batch of changes must run in a transaction that
takes a global DML lock on the table. Otherwise you can miss rows
that are inserted concurrently into the table on other nodes.

If required, you can run `ALTER TABLE mytable ALTER COLUMN newcolumn NOT NULL;` after the `UPDATE` has finished.

#### Changing a column's type

PostgreSQL causes a table rewrite in some cases where it could be avoided,
for example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE foo (id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY, description VARCHAR(128));
ALTER TABLE foo ALTER COLUMN description TYPE VARCHAR(20);
```

You can rewrite this statement to avoid a table rewrite by making the
restriction a table constraint rather than a datatype change. The constraint can
then be validated in a subsequent command to avoid long locks, if you want.

```sql
CREATE TABLE foo (id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY, description VARCHAR(128));
ALTER TABLE foo
  ALTER COLUMN description TYPE varchar,
  ADD CONSTRAINT description_length_limit CHECK (length(description) <= 20) NOT VALID;
ALTER TABLE foo VALIDATE CONSTRAINT description_length_limit;
```

If the validation fails, then you can `UPDATE` just the failing rows.
You can use this technique for `TEXT` and `VARCHAR` using `length()` or with
`NUMERIC` datatype using `scale()`.

In the general case for changing column type, first add a column of the desired type:

```
ALTER TABLE mytable ADD COLUMN newcolumn newtype;
```

Create a trigger defined as `BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON mytable FOR EACH ROW ..`,
which assigns `NEW.newcolumn` to `NEW.oldcolumn` so that new writes to the
table update the new column automatically.

`UPDATE` the table in batches to copy the value of `oldcolumn` to
`newcolumn` using a `PROCEDURE` with embedded transactions. Batching the work
helps reduce replication lag if it's a big table. Updating by range of
IDs or whatever method you prefer is fine. Alternatively, you can update the whole table in one pass for
smaller tables.

`CREATE INDEX ...` any required indexes on the new column. It's safe to
use `CREATE INDEX ... CONCURRENTLY` run individually without DDL replication
on each node to reduce lock durations.

`ALTER` the column to add a `NOT NULL` and `CHECK` constraints, if required.

1. `BEGIN` a transaction.
1. `DROP` the trigger you added. 
1. `ALTER TABLE` to add any `DEFAULT` required on the column. 
1. `DROP` the old column.
1. `ALTER TABLE mytable RENAME COLUMN newcolumn TO oldcolumn`. 
1. `COMMIT`.

!!! Note 
    Because you're dropping a column, you might have to re-create views, procedures,
    and so on that depend on the table. Be careful if you `CASCADE` drop the column,
    as you must be sure you re-create everything that referred to it.

#### Changing other types

The `ALTER TYPE` statement is replicated, but affected tables aren't locked.

When this DDL is used, ensure that the statement has successfully
executed on all nodes before using the new type. You can achieve this using
the `bdr.wait_slot_confirm_lsn()` function.

This example ensures that the DDL is written to all nodes before using the new value
in DML statements:

```
ALTER TYPE contact_method ADD VALUE 'email';
SELECT bdr.wait_slot_confirm_lsn(NULL, NULL);
```

### BDR functions that behave like DDL

The following BDR management functions act like DDL. This means that, if DDL
replication is active and DDL filter settings allow it, they
attempt to take global locks and their actions are replicate. For detailed
information, see the documentation for the individual functions.

Replication set management

-   `bdr.create_replication_set`
-   `bdr.alter_replication_set`
-   `bdr.drop_replication_set`
-   `bdr.replication_set_add_table`
-   `bdr.replication_set_remove_table`
-   `bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter`
-   `bdr.replication_set_remove_ddl_filter`

Conflict management

-   `bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection`
-   `bdr.column_timestamps_enable`
-   `bdr.column_timestamps_disable`

Sequence management

-   `bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind`

Stream triggers

-   `bdr.create_conflict_trigger`
-   `bdr.create_transform_trigger`
-   `bdr.drop_trigger`
