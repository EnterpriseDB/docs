navTitle: Commit at Most Once
title: Commit At Most Once
---

The objective of the Commit at Most Once (CAMO) feature is to prevent
the application from committing more than once.

Without CAMO, when a client loses connection after COMMIT has been
submitted, the application might not receive a reply from the server
and will therefore be unsure whether the transaction committed or
not.

The application cannot easily decide between the two options of:

1) retrying the transaction with the same data, since this can in some
   cases cause the data to be entered twice, or

2) not retrying the transaction, and risk that the data doesn't get
   processed at all.

Either of those is a critical error with high value data.

There are two ways to avoid this situation:

One way to avoid this situation is to make sure that the transaction
includes at least one `INSERT` into a table with a unique index, but
that is dependent upon the application design and requires application-
specific error-handling logic, so is not effective in all cases.

The CAMO feature in BDR offers a more general solution and does
not require an `INSERT` as described above. When activated via
`bdr.enable_camo` or `bdr.commit_scope`, the application will
receive a message containing the transaction identifier, if already
assigned. Otherwise, the first write statement in a transaction will
send that information to the client.
If the application sends an explicit COMMIT, the protocol
will ensure that the application will have received the notification
of the transaction identifier before the COMMIT is sent.
If the server does not reply to the COMMIT, the application can
handle this error by using the transaction identifier to request
the final status of the transaction from another BDR node.
If the prior transaction status is known, then the application can safely
decide whether or not to retry the transaction.

CAMO works in one of two modes:

- Pair mode
- In combination with Eager All Node Replication

In the Pair mode, CAMO works by creating a pair of partner nodes that
are two BDR master nodes from the same top level BDR group. In this operation mode,
each node in the pair knows the outcome of any recent transaction executed
on the other peer, and especially (for our need) knows the outcome of any
transaction disconnected during COMMIT.
We may refer as "origin" to the node that receives the transactions from
the application and "partner" the node that confirms these transactions,
but there is no difference in the CAMO configuration for the nodes in the
CAMO pair. The pair is symmetric.

When combined with [Eager All Node Replication](eager), CAMO
enables every peer (that is a full BDR master node) to act as a CAMO partner.
No designated CAMO partner needs to be configured in this mode.

!!! Warning
    CAMO requires changes to the user's application
    to take advantage of the advanced error handling: it is not sufficient
    to enable a parameter to gain protection. Reference client implementations
    are provided to customers upon request.

## Requirements

To utilize CAMO, an application must issue an explicit COMMIT message,
issued as a separate request (not as part of a multi-statement request).
CAMO cannot provide status for transactions issued from within procedures,
or from single-statement transactions that use implicit commits.

## Configuration

Assuming an existing BDR cluster consisting of the two nodes `node1` and
`node2`, both with a BDR enabled database called `bdrdemo`, and both part
of the same node group `mygroup` the following steps will configure the nodes
to be CAMO partners for each other.

1) Create the BDR cluster where nodes `node1` and `node2` are part of
`mygroup` node group.
2) Run the function `bdr.add_camo_pair()` on one node:

```sql
SELECT bdr.add_camo_pair('mygroup', 'node1', 'node2');
```
3) Adjust the application to use the COMMIT error handling that CAMO suggests.

We do not recommend enabling CAMO at server level, as this imposes
higher latency for all transactions, even when not needed. Instead,
we recommend to selectively enable it just for individual transactions
by turning on CAMO at session or transaction level.

To enable at session level, issue:

```sql
SET bdr.enable_camo = 'remote_commit_flush';
```

...or to enable for individual transactions, issue this after starting the
transaction and before committing it:

```sql
SET LOCAL bdr.enable_camo = 'remote_commit_flush';
```

Valid values for `bdr.enable_camo` that enable CAMO are:

* `off` (default)
* `remote_write`
* `remote_commit_async`
* `remote_commit_flush` or `on`

See the [Comparison](durability#Comparison) of synchronous replication
modes for details about how each mode behaves.
Setting `bdr.enable_camo = off` disables this feature, which is the default.

### CAMO with Eager All Node Replication

To use CAMO with Eager All Node Replication, no changes are required
on either node. It is sufficient to enable the global commit
scope after the start of the transaction - you do not need to set
`bdr.enable_camo` at all.

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL bdr.commit_scope = 'global';
...
COMMIT;
```

The application still needs to be adjusted to use COMMIT error
handling as specified, but is free to connect to any available BDR
node to query the transaction's status.

## Failure Scenarios

In this section, we analyze failure scenarios for different
configurations. After comparing Local mode with CAMO mode in terms of
Availability versus Consistency, we also provide three specific
examples.

### Data persistence at receiver side

By default, a PGL writer operates in
`bdr.synchronous_commit = off` mode when applying transactions
from remote nodes. This holds true for CAMO as well, meaning that
transactions are confirmed to the origin node possibly before reaching
the disk of the CAMO partner. In case of a crash or hardware failure,
it is possible for a confirmed transaction to not be recoverable on the
CAMO partner by itself. This is not an issue as long as the CAMO
origin node remains operational, as it will redistribute the
transaction once the CAMO partner node recovers.

This in turn means CAMO can protect against a single node failure,
which is correct for Local mode as well as (or even in combination
with) Remote Write.

To cover an outage of both nodes of a CAMO pair, it is possible to use
`bdr.synchronous_commit = local` to enforce a flush prior to the
pre-commit confirmation. This does not work in combination with
either Remote Write nor Local mode, and has an additional performance
impact due to additional I/O requirements on the CAMO partner in the
latency sensitive commit path.

### Local Mode

When `synchronous_replication_availability = 'async'`, a node
(i.e. master) will detect whether its CAMO partner is
ready; if not, it will temporarily switch to **Local** mode.
When in Local mode, a node commits transactions locally, until
switching back to CAMO mode.

This clearly does not allow COMMIT status to be retrieved, but does
provide the option to choose availability over consistency. This mode
can tolerate a single node failure. In case both nodes of a CAMO pair
fail, they may choose incongruent commit decisions to maintain
availability, leading to data inconsistencies.

For a CAMO partner to switch to ready, it needs to be connected, and
the estimated catchup interval needs to drop below
`bdr.global_commit_timeout`.  The current readiness status of a CAMO
partner can be checked with `bdr.is_camo_partner_ready`, while
`bdr.node_replication_rates` provides the current estimate of the catchup
time.

The switch from CAMO protected to Local Mode is only ever triggered by
an actual CAMO transaction.  Either because the commit exceeds the
`bdr.global_commit_timeout` or in case the CAMO partner is already
known disconnected at the time of commit.  This switch is independent
of the estimated catchup interval.  If the CAMO pair is configured to
require Raft to switch to Local Mode, this switch will require a
majority of nodes to be operational (see the `require_raft` flag for
[bdr.add_camo_pair](camo#adding-a-camo-pair)).  This can prevent a
split brain situation due to an isolated node from switching to Local
Mode.  If `require_raft` is not set for the CAMO pair, the origin node
will switch to Local Mode immediately.

The detection on the sending node can be configured via PostgreSQL
settings controlling keep-alives and timeouts on the TCP connection to
the CAMO partner.
The `wal_sender_timeout` is the amount of time that a node waits
for a CAMO partner until switching to Local mode. Additionally,
the `bdr.global_commit_timeout` setting puts a per-transaction
limit on the maximum delay a COMMIT can incur due to the
CAMO partner being unreachable. It may well be lower than the
`wal_sender_timeout`, which influences synchronous standbys as
well, and for which a good compromise between responsiveness and
stability needs to be found.

The switch from Local mode to CAMO mode depends on the CAMO partner
node, which initiates the connection. The CAMO partner tries to
re-connect at least every 30 seconds. After connectivity is
reestablished, it may therefore take up to 30 seconds until the CAMO
partner connects back to its origin node. Any lag that accumulated on
the CAMO partner will further delay the switch back to CAMO protected
mode.

Unlike during normal CAMO operation, in Local mode there is no
additional commit overhead. This can be problematic, as it allows the
node to continuously process more transactions than the CAMO
pair could normally process. Even if the CAMO partner eventually
reconnects and applies transactions, its lag will only ever increase
in such a situation, preventing re-establishing the CAMO protection.
To artificially throttle transactional throughput, BDR provides the
`bdr.camo_local_mode_delay` setting, allowing to delay COMMITs in
Local mode by an arbitrary amount of time. We recommend to measure
commit times in normal CAMO mode during expected workloads and
configure this delay accordingly. The default is 5 ms, which reflects
a local network and a relatively quick CAMO partner response.

The choice of whether to allow Local mode should be taken in view of
the architecture and the availability requirements. We expand this
point by discussing three specific examples in some detail.

### Example: Symmetric Node Pair

In this section we consider a setup with two BDR nodes that are the
CAMO partner of each other.
This is the only possible configuration starting with BDR4.

This configuration enables CAMO behavior on both nodes; it is
therefore suitable for workload patterns where it is acceptable to
write concurrently on more than one node, e.g. in cases that are not
likely to generate conflicts.

#### With Local Mode

If Local mode is allowed, there is no single point of failure, and
when one node fails:

- The other node can determine the status of all transactions that
  were disconnected during COMMIT on the failed node.
- New write transactions are allowed:
	- If the second node also fails, then the outcome of those
	  transactions that were being committed at that time will be
	  unknown.

#### Without Local Mode

If Local mode is not allowed, then each node requires the other node
for committing transactions, i.e. each node is a single point of
failure. Precisely, when one node fails:

- The other node can determine the status of all transactions that
  were disconnected during COMMIT on the failed node.
- New write transactions will be prevented until the node recovers.

## Application Usage

### Overview and Requirements

Commit At Most Once relies on a retry loop and specific error handling
on the client side. There are three aspects to it:

* The result of a transaction's COMMIT needs to be checked, and in
  case of a temporary error, the client must retry the transaction.
* Prior to COMMIT, the client needs to retrieve a global
  identifier for the transaction, consisting of a **node id** and a
  **transaction id** (both 32 bit integers).
* Should the current server fail while attempting COMMIT of a transaction,
  the application must connect to its CAMO partner, retrieve the status
  of that transaction, and retry depending on the response.

Note that the application needs to store the global transaction
identifier only for the purpose of verifying the transaction status in
case of disconnection during COMMIT. In particular, the application
does not need any additional persistence layer: if the application
fails, it only needs the information in the database to restart.

### Adding a CAMO pair

The function `bdr.add_camo_pair()` configures an existing pair of BDR
nodes to work as a symmetric CAMO pair.

The `require_raft` option controls how and when to switch to Local
Mode in case `synchronous_replication_availability` is set to `async`,
allowing such a switch in general.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.add_camo_pair(node_group text, left_node text, right_node text,
                  require_raft bool)
```

!!! Note
    The names `left` and `right` have no special meaning.

!!! Note
    Since BDR version 4.0, only symmetric CAMO configurations are
    supported, i.e. both nodes of the pair act as a CAMO partner for
    each other.

### Changing the configuration of a CAMO pair

The function `bdr.alter_camo_pair()` allows to toggle the
`require_raft` flag.  Note that it is not currently possible to change
the nodes of a pairing, `bdr.remove_camo_pair` followed by
`bdr.add_camo_pair` must be used, instead.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_camo_pair(node_group text, left_node text, right_node text,
                    require_raft bool)
```

### Removing a CAMO pair

The function `bdr.remove_camo_pair()` removes a CAMO pairing of two
nodes and disallows future use of CAMO transactions via
`bdr.enable_camo` on those two nodes.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.remove_camo_pair(node_group text, left_node text, right_node text)
```

!!! Note
    The names `left` and `right` have no special meaning.

### CAMO partner connection status

The function `bdr.is_camo_partner_connected` allows checking the
connection status of a CAMO partner node configured in Pair mode.
There currently is no equivalent for CAMO used in combination with
Eager Replication.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.is_camo_partner_connected()
```

#### Return value

A boolean value indicating whether the CAMO partner is currently
connected to a WAL sender process on the local node and therefore able
to receive transactional data and send back confirmations.

### CAMO partner readiness

The function `bdr.is_camo_partner_ready` allows checking the readiness
status of a CAMO partner node configured in Pair mode.  Underneath,
this is what's used to trigger the switch to and from Local mode.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.is_camo_partner_ready()
```

#### Return value

A boolean value indicating whether the CAMO partner can reasonably be
expected to confirm transactions originating from the local node in a
timely manner (i.e. before `bdr.global_commit_timeout` expires).

!!! Note
    Note that this function queries the past or current state.  A
    positive return value is no indication for the CAMO partner being
    able to confirm future transactions.

### Fetch the CAMO partner

This function shows the local node's CAMO partner (configured via Pair
mode).

```sql
bdr.get_configured_camo_partner()
```

### Wait for consumption of the apply queue from the CAMO partner

The function `bdr.wait_for_camo_partner_queue` is a wrapper of
`bdr.wait_for_apply_queue` defaulting to query the CAMO partner node.
It yields an error if the local node is not part of a CAMO pair.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.wait_for_camo_partner_queue()
```

### Transaction status between CAMO nodes

This function enables a wait for CAMO transactions to be fully resolved.

```sql
bdr.camo_transactions_resolved()
```

### Transaction status query function

The application should use the function:

```sql
bdr.logical_transaction_status(node_id, xid, require_camo_partner)
```

...to check the status of a transaction which was being committed when the node
failed.

With CAMO used in Pair mode, this function should only ever be used on
a node that's part of a CAMO pair.  In combination with Eager
Replication, it may be used on all nodes.

In both cases, the function needs to be called within 15 minutes after
the commit was issued, as the CAMO partner needs to regularly purge
such meta-information and therefore cannot provide correct answers for
older transactions.

Prior to querying the status of a transaction, this function waits for
the receive queue to be consumed and fully applied. This prevents
early negative answers for transactions that have already been
received, but not applied, yet.

Note that despite its name, it is not always a read-only operation.
If the status is unknown, the CAMO partner will decide whether to
commit or abort the transaction, storing that decision locally to
ensure consistency going forward.

Also note that the client must not call this function before
attempting to commit on the origin, otherwise the transaction may be
forced to be rolled back.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.logical_transaction_status(node_id OID,
                               xid     OID,
                               require_camo_partner BOOL DEFAULT true)
```

#### Parameters

- `node_id` - the node id of the BDR node the transaction originates
  from, usually retrieved by the client before COMMIT from the PQ
  parameter `bdr.local_node_id`.
- `xid` - the transaction id on the origin node, usually retrieved by
  the client before COMMIT from the PQ parameter `transaction_id`
  (requires `enable_camo` to be set to `on`, `remote_write`,
  `remote_commit_async`, or `remote_commit_flush`. See
  [Commit at Most Once Settings](configuration#commit-at-most-once))
- `require_camo_partner` - defaults to true and enables configuration
  checks; may be set to false to disable these checks and query the
  status of a transaction that was protected by Eager All Node
  Replication.

#### Return value

The function will return one of these results:

- `'committed'::TEXT` - the transaction has been committed, is visible
  on both nodes of the CAMO pair and will eventually be replicated to
  all other BDR nodes. No need for the client to retry it.

- `'aborted'::TEXT` - the transaction has been aborted and will not be
  replicated to any other BDR node. The client needs to either
  retry it or escalate the failure to commit the transaction.

- `'in progress'::TEXT` - the transaction is still in progress on this
  local node and has neither been committed nor aborted, yet. Note
  that the transaction may well be in the COMMIT phase, waiting for
  the CAMO partner to confirm or deny the commit. The recommended
  client reaction is to disconnect from the origin node and reconnect
  to the CAMO partner to query that instead. With a load balancer or proxy
  in between, where the client lacks control over which node gets
  queried, the client can only poll repeatedly until the status
  switches to either `'committed'` or `'aborted'`.

  For Eager All Node Replication, peer nodes yield this result for
  transactions that are not yet committed or aborted. This means that
  even transactions not yet replicated (or not even started on the
  origin node) may yield an `in progress` result on a peer BDR node in
  this case. However, the client must not query the transaction
  status prior to attempting to commit on the origin.

- `'unknown'::TEXT` - the transaction specified is unknown, either
  because it is in the future, not replicated to that specific node
  yet, or too far in the past. The status of such a transaction is
  not yet or no longer known. This return value is a sign of improper
  use by the client.

The client must be prepared to retry the function call on error.

## Interaction with DDL and global locks

Transactions protected by CAMO may contain DDL operations. Note
however that DDL uses global locks, which already provide some
synchronization among nodes; see
[DDL Locking Details](ddl#ddl-locking-details) for more
information.

Combining CAMO with DDL not only imposes a higher latency, but also
increases the chance of global deadlocks. We therefore recommend using a
relatively low `bdr.global_lock_timeout`, which aborts the DDL and
therefore resolves a deadlock in a reasonable amount of time.

### Non-transactional DDL

The following DDL operations are not allowed within a transaction
block and therefore cannot possibly benefit from CAMO protection. For
these, CAMO is automatically disabled internally:

* all concurrent index operations (`CREATE`, `DROP`, and `REINDEX`)
* `REINDEX DATABASE`, `REINDEX SCHEMA`, and `REINDEX SYSTEM`
* `VACUUM`
* `CLUSTER` without any parameter
* `ALTER TABLE DETACH PARTITION CONCURRENTLY`
* `ALTER TYPE [enum] ADD VALUE`
* `ALTER SYSTEM`
* `CREATE` and `DROP DATABASE`
* `CREATE` and `DROP TABLESPACE`
* `ALTER DATABASE [db] TABLESPACE`

## CAMO Limitations

CAMO is designed to query the results of a recently failed COMMIT on
the origin node, so in case of disconnection, the application should
be coded to immediately request the transaction status from the CAMO partner.
There should be as little delay as possible after the failure before
requesting the status.  Applications should not rely on CAMO decisions
being stored for longer than 15 minutes.

If the application forgets the global identifier assigned, for example
as a result of a restart, there is no easy way to recover
that. Therefore, it is recommended applications wait for outstanding
transactions to terminate before shutting down.

For the client to apply proper checks, a transaction protected by CAMO
cannot be a single statement with implicit transaction control. Nor
is it possible to use CAMO with a transaction-controlling procedure or
within a `DO` block that tries to start or end transactions.

Changing the CAMO partners in a CAMO pair is not currently possible.
It's only possible to add or remove a pair.
Adding or removing a pair does not need a restart of Postgres or even a
reload of the configuration.

CAMO resolves commit status but does not yet resolve pending
notifications on commit. CAMO and Eager replication options do not
allow the `NOTIFY` SQL command or the `pg_notify()` function,
nor do they allow `LISTEN` or `UNLISTEN`.

Replacing a crashed and unrecoverable BDR node with its physical
standby is not currently supported in combination with CAMO-protected
transactions.

Also, CAMO does not currently work together with the Decoding Worker.
Installations using CAMO must keep `enable_wal_decoder` disabled for
the BDR node group using CAMO.

Legacy BDR synchronous replication uses a mechanism for transaction confirmation
different from CAMO.  The two are not compatible and must not be used
together.  Therefore, a CAMO partner must not be configured in
`synchronous_standby_names`.  Using synchronous replication to a
non-BDR node acting as a physical standby is well possible.

When replaying changes, CAMO transactions may detect conflicts just
the same as other transactions. If timestamp conflict detection is used,
the CAMO transaction uses the timestamp of the prepare on the origin
node, which is before the transaction becomes visible on the origin
node itself.

## Performance Implications

CAMO extends Postgres' replication protocol by adding an additional
message round trip at commit. Applications should expect a higher
commit latency than with asynchronous replication, mostly determined
by the round trip time between involved nodes. Increasing the number
of concurrent sessions can help to increase parallelism to still
obtain reasonable transaction throughput.

The CAMO partner confirming transactions needs to store transaction
states. Again, compared to non-CAMO operation, this might require an
additional seek for each transaction applied from the origin.

## Client Application Testing

Proper use of CAMO on the client side is not trivial; we strongly
recommend testing the application behavior in combination with the BDR
cluster against failure scenarios such as node crashes or network
outages.

## CAMO versus Group Commit

CAMO does not currently work in combination with
[Group Commit](group_commit).
