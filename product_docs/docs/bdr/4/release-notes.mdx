## BDR 4.1.0

This is a minor release of BDR 4 which includes new features as well
as fixes for issues identified in previous versions.

### Improvements

-   Support in-place major upgrade of Postgres on a BDR node (BDR-1831)

    This BDR release include as new command-line utility `bdr_pg_upgrade` which
    uses `pg_upgrade` to do a major version upgrade of Postgres on a BDR node.

    This reduces the time and network bandwidth necessary to do major version
    upgrades of Postgres in a BDR cluster.

-   Replication lag control (BDR-1411)

    Add configuration for a replication lag threshold after which the
    transaction commits get throttled. This allows limiting RPO without
    incurring the latency impact on every transaction that comes with
    synchronous replication.

-   Distributed sequences by default (BDR-441)

    The default value of `bdr.default_sequence_kind` has been changed to
    `'distributed'` which is new kind of sequence that uses SnowFlakeId for
    `bigserial` and Galloc sequences for `serial` column type.

-   PGD CLI (BDR-1983)

    This BDR release includes a new command-line utility called `pgd` that
    allows users to do various cluster state checks and to fetch information
    about cluster.

    This will in future releases become the primary CLI tool for both BDR and HARP.

-   Simplified synchronous replication configuration (BDR-1828)

    New syntax for specifying the synchronous replication options, with focus
    on BDR groups and SQL based management (as opposed to config file).

    In future versions this will also replace the current Eager Replication and
    CAMO configuration options.

-   Group Commit (BDR-1828)

    The initial kind of synchronous commit that can be configured via the new
    configuration syntax.

-   Allow a Raft request to be required for CAMO switching to Local Mode (BDR-1925, RT78928)

    Add a `require_raft` flag to the CAMO pairing configuration which
    controls the behavior of switching from CAMO protected to Local
    Mode, introducing the option to require a majority of nodes to be
    connected to allow to switch to Local Mode.

-   Allow replication to continue on `ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION CONCURRENTLY`
    of already detached partition (RT78362, BDR-1958)

    Similarly to how BDR 4 handles `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` when same index
    already exists, we now allow replication to continue when
    `ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION CONCURRENTLY` is receiver for partition
    that has been already detached.

-   Implement buffered write for LCR segment file (BDR-1421)

    This should reduce I/O and improve CPU usage of the Decoding Worker.

-   Add `fast` argument to bdr.alter_subscription_disable() (BDR-2017, RT79798)

    The argument only influences the behavior of `immediate`.
    When set to `true` (default) it will stop the workers without letting them
    finish the current work.

-   Simplify `bdr.{add,remove}_camo_pair` functions to return void (BDR-1961)

### Resolved Issues

-   Keep the `lock_timeout` as configured on non-CAMO-partner BDR nodes (BDR-1916)

    A CAMO partner uses a low `lock_timeout` when applying transactions
    from its origin node.  This was inadvertently done for all BDR nodes
    rather than just the CAMO partner, which may have led to spurious
    `lock_timeout` errors on pglogical writer processes on normal BDR
    nodes.

-   Show a proper wait event for CAMO / Eager confirmation waits (BDR-1899,RT75900)

    Show correct "BDR Prepare Phase"/"BDR Commit Phase" in `bdr.stat_activity`
    instead of the default “unknown wait event”.

-   Reduce log for bdr.run_on_nodes (BDR-2153, RT80973)

    Don't log when setting `bdr.ddl_replication` to off if it's
    done with the "run_on_nodes" variants of function. This eliminates
    the flood of logs for monitoring functions.

### Upgrades

This release supports upgrading from the following versions of BDR:

-   4.0.0 and higher
-   3.7.15
-   3.7.16

Please make sure you read and understand the process and limitations described
in the [Upgrade Guide](upgrades.md) before upgrading.


## BDR 4.0.2

This is a maintenance release for BDR 4.0 which includes minor
improvements as well as fixes for issues identified in previous
versions.

### Improvements

-   Add `bdr.max_worker_backoff_delay` (BDR-1767)

    This changes the handling of the backoff delay to exponentially
    increase from `bdr.min_worker_backoff_delay` to
    `bdr.max_worker_backoff_delay` in presence of repeated errors.  This
    reduces log spam and in some cases also prevents unnecessary
    connection attempts.

-   Add `execute_locally` option to `bdr.replicate_ddl_command()` (RT73533)

    This allows optional queueing of ddl commands for replication to other groups
    without executing it locally.

-   Change ERROR on consensus issue during JOIN to WARNING

    The reporting of these transient errors was confusing as they were
    also shown in bdr.worker_errors.  These are now changed to WARNINGs.

### Resolved Issues

-   WAL decoder confirms end LSN of the running transactions record (BDR-1264)

    Confirm end LSN of the running transactions record processed by WAL
    decoder so that the WAL decoder slot remains up to date and WAL senders
    get the candidate in timely manner.

-   Don't wait for autopartition tasks to complete on parting nodes (BDR-1867)

    When a node has started parting process, it makes no sense to wait for
    autopartition tasks on such nodes to finish since it's not part of the group
    anymore.

-   Improve handling of node name reuse during parallel join (RT74789)

    Nodes now have a generation number so that it's easier to identify the name
    reuse even if the node record is received as part of a snapshot.

-   Fix locking and snapshot use during node management in the BDR manager
    process (RT74789)

    When processing multiple actions in the state machine, make sure to reacquire
    the lock on the processed node and update the snapshot to make sure all updates
    happening through consensus are taken into account.

-   Improve cleanup of catalogs on local node drop

    Drop all groups, not only the primary one and drop all the node state
    history info as well.

-   Improve error checking for join request in bdr_init_physical

    Previously bdr_init_physical would simply wait forever when there was any issue
    with the consensus request, now we do same checking as the logical join does.

-   Improve handling of various timeouts and sleeps in consensus

    This reduces the amount of new consensus votes needed when processing many consensus
    requests or time consuming consensus requests, for example during join of a
    new node.

-   Fix handling of `wal_receiver_timeout` (BDR-1848)

    The `wal_receiver_timeout` has not been triggered correctly due to a regression
    in BDR 3.7 and 4.0.

-   Limit the `bdr.standby_slot_names` check when reporting flush position only to
    physical slots (RT77985, RT78290)

    Otherwise flush progress is not reported in presence of disconnected nodes when
    using `bdr.standby_slot_names`.

-   Fix replication of data types created during bootstrap (BDR-1784)

-   Fix replication of arrays of builtin types that don't have binary transfer support (BDR-1042)

-   Prevent CAMO configuration warnings if CAMO is not being used (BDR-1825)

### Upgrades

This release supports upgrading from the following versions of BDR:

-   4.0.0 and higher

The upgrade path from BDR 3.7 is not currently stable and needs to be
considered beta.  Tests should be performed with at least BDR 3.7.15.

Please make sure you read and understand the process and limitations described
in the [Upgrade Guide](upgrades) before upgrading.

## BDR 4.0.1

This is a maintenance release for BDR 4.0 which includes minor
improvements as well as fixes for issues identified in previous
versions.

### Improvements

-   Reduce frequency of CAMO partner connection attempts

    In case of a failure to connect to a CAMO partner to verify its
    configuration and check the status of transactions, do not retry
    immediately (leading to a fully busy pglogical manager process), but
    throttle down repeated attempts to reconnect and checks to once per
    minute.

-   Implement buffered read for LCR segment file (BDR-1422)

    Implement LCR segment file buffering so that multiple LCR chunks
    can be read at a time. This should reduce
    I/O and improve CPU usage of Wal Senders when using the Decoding Worker.

-   Avoid unnecessary LCR segment reads (BDR-1426)

    BDR now attempts to only read new LCR segments when there is at
    least one available.  This reduces I/O load when Decoding Worker is
    enabled.

-   Performance of COPY replication including the initial COPY during join has
    been greatly improved for partitioned tables (BDR-1479)

    For large tables this can improve the load times by order of magnitude or
    more.

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix the parallel apply worker selection (BDR-1761)

    This makes parallel apply work again. In 4.0.0 parallel apply was never
    in effect due to this bug.

-   Fix Raft snapshot handling of `bdr.camo_pairs` (BDR-1753)

    The previous release would not correctly propagate changes to the CAMO pair
    configuration when they were received via Raft snapshot.

-   Correctly handle Raft snapshots from BDR 3.7 after upgrades (BDR-1754)

    Upgrading a CAMO configured cluster taking into account the
    `bdr.camo_pairs` in the snapshot while still excluding the ability
    to perform in place upgrade of a cluster (due to upgrade
    limitations unrelated to CAMO).

-   Switch from CAMO to Local Mode only after timeouts (RT74892)

    Do not use the `catchup_interval` estimate when switching from CAMO
    protected to Local Mode, as that could induce inadvertent switching
    due to load spikes.  Use the estimate only when switching from Local
    Mode back to CAMO protected (to prevent toggling forth and back due
    to lag on the CAMO partner).

-   Fix replication set cache invalidation when published replication set list
    have changed (BDR-1715)

    In previous versions we could use stale information about which replication
    sets (and as a result which tables) should be published until the subscription
    has reconnected.

-   Prevent duplicate values generated locally by galloc sequence in high
    concurrency situations when the new chunk is used (RT76528)

    The galloc sequence could have temporarily produce duplicate value when
    switching which chunk is used locally (but not across nodes) if there were
    multiple sessions waiting for the new value. This is now fixed.

-   Address memory leak on streaming transactions (BDR-1479)

    For large transaction this reduces memory usage and I/O considerably when using
    the streaming transactions feature. This primarily improves performance of
    COPY replication.

-   Don't leave slot behind after PART_CATCHUP phase of node parting when the
    catchup source has changed while the node was parting (BDR-1716)

    When node is being removed (parted) from BDR group, we do so called catchup
    in order to forward any missing changes from that node between remaining nodes
    in order to keep the data on all nodes consistent. This requires an additional
    replication slot to be created temporarily. Normally this replication slot
    is removed at the end of the catchup phase, however in certain scenarios
    where we have to change the source node for the changes, this slot could
    have previously been left behind. From this version, this slot is always
    correctly removed.

-   Ensure that the group slot is moved forward when there is only one node in
    the BDR group

    This prevents disk exhaustion due to WAL accumulation when the group is left
    running with just single BDR node for a prolonged period of time. This is not
    recommended setup but the WAL accumulation was not intentional.

-   Advance Raft protocol version when there is only one node in the BDR group

    Single node clusters would otherwise always stay on oldest support protocol
    until another node was added. This could limit available feature set on that
    single node.

### Upgrades

This release supports upgrading from the following versions of BDR:

-   3.7.14
-   4.0.0 and higher

Please make sure you read and understand the process and limitations described
in the [Upgrade Guide](upgrades) before upgrading.

## BDR 4.0.0

BDR 4.0 is a new major version of BDR and adopted with this release number is
semantic versioning (for details see semver.org). The two previous major
versions are 3.7 and 3.6.

### Improvements

-   BDR on EDB Postgres Advanced 14 now supports following features
    which were previously only available on EDB Postgres Extended:

    -   Commit At Most Once - a consistency feature helping
        an application to commit each transaction only once, even in the
        presence of node failures
    -   Eager Replication - synchronizes between the nodes of the cluster before
        committing a transaction to provide conflict free replication
    -   Decoding Worker - separation of decoding into separate worker from wal
        senders allowing for better scalability with many nodes
    -   Estimates for Replication Catch-up times
    -   Timestamp-based Snapshots - providing consistent reads across multiple
        nodes for retrieving data as they appeared or will appear at a given time
    -   Automated dynamic configuration of row freezing to improve consistency
        of UPDATE/DELETE conflicts resolution in certain corner cases
    -   Assesment checks
    -   Support for handling missing partitions as conflicts rather than errors
    -   Advanced DDL Handling for NOT VALID constraints and ALTER TABLE

-   BDR on community version of PostgreSQL 12-14 now supports following features
    which were previously only available on EDB Postgres Advanced or
    EDB Postgres Extended:

    -   Conflict-free Replicated Data Types - additional data types which provide
        mathematically proven consistency in asynchronous multi-master update
        scenarios
    -   Column Level Conflict Resolution - ability to use per column last-update
        wins resolution so that UPDATEs on different fields can be "merged" without
        losing either of them
    -   Transform Triggers - triggers that are executed on the incoming stream of
        data providing ability to modify it or to do advanced programmatic filtering
    -   Conflict triggers - triggers which are called when conflict is detected,
        providing a way to use custom conflict resolution techniques
    -   CREATE TABLE AS replication
    -   Parallel Apply - allow multiple writers to apply the incoming changes

-   Support streaming of large transactions.

     This allows BDR to stream a large transaction (greater than
    `logical_decoding_work_mem` in size) either to a file on the downstream
     or to a writer process. This ensures that the transaction is decoded
     even before it's committed, thus improving parallelism. Further, the
     transaction can even be applied concurrently if streamed straight to a
     writer. This improves parallelism even more.

     When large transactions are streamed to files, they are decoded and
     the decoded changes are sent to the downstream even before they are
     committed. The changes are written to a set of files and applied when
     the transaction finally commits. If the transaction aborts, the changes
     are discarded, thus wasting resources on both upstream and downstream.

     Sub-transactions are also handled automatically.

     This feature is available on PostgreSQL 14, EDB Postgres Extended 13+ and
     EDB Postgres Advanced 14, see [Feature Compatibility](feature-matrix)
     appendix for more details on which features can be used on which versions
     of Postgres.

-   The differences that existed in earlier versions of BDR between standard
    and enterprise edition have been removed. With BDR 4.0 there is one extension
    for each supported Postgres distribution and version, i.e., PostgreSQL v12-14,
    EDB Postgres Extended v12-14, and EDB Postgres Advanced 12-14.

     Not all features are available on all versions of PostgreSQL, the available
     features are reported via feature flags using either `bdr_config` command
     line utility or `bdr.bdr_features()` database function. See
     [Feature Compatibility](feature-matrix) appendix for more details.

-   There is no pglogical 4.0 extension that corresponds to the BDR 4.0 extension.
    BDR no longer has a requirement for pglogical.

     This means also that only BDR extension and schema exist and any
     configuration parameters were renamed from `pglogical.` to `bdr.`.

-   Some configuration options have change defaults for better post-install
    experience:

    -   Parallel apply is now enabled by default (with 2 writers). Allows for
        better performance, especially with streaming enabled.
    -   `COPY` and `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` are now streamed directly to writer
        in parallel (on Postgres versions where streaming is supported) to all
        available nodes by default, eliminating or at least reducing replication
        lag spikes after these operations.
    -   The timeout for global locks have been increased to 10 minutes
    -   The `bdr.min_worker_backoff_delay` now defaults to 1s so that
        subscriptions retry connection only once per second on error

-   Greatly reduced the chance of false positives in conflict detection during
    node join for table that use origin based conflict detection

-   Move configuration of CAMO pairs to Raft (CAMO)

     To reduce chances of misconfiguration and make CAMO pairs within the
     BDR cluster known globally, move the CAMO configuration from the
     individual node's postgresql.conf to BDR system catalogs managed by
     Raft.  This for example can prevent against inadvertently dropping a
     node that's still configured to be a CAMO partner for another active
     node.

     Please see the [Upgrades chapter](upgrades#upgrading-a-camo-enable-cluster)
     for details on the upgrade process.

     This deprecates GUCs `bdr.camo_partner_of` and `bdr.camo_origin_for`
     and replaces the functions `bdr.get_configured_camo_origin_for()`
     and `get_configured_camo_partner_of` with
     `bdr.get_configured_camo_partner`.

### Upgrades

This release supports upgrading from the following version of BDR:

-   3.7.13.1

Please make sure you read and understand the process and limitations described
in the [Upgrade Guide](upgrades) before upgrading.
