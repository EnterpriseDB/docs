## Overview

Synchronous or *Eager Replication* synchronizes between at least two
nodes of the cluster before committing a transaction.  This provides
three properties of interest to applications, which are related, but
can all be implemented individually:

-   *Durability*: writing to multiple nodes increases crash resilience
    and allows the data to be recovered after a crash and restart.
-   *Visibility*: with the commit confirmation to the client, the database
    guarantees immediate visibility of the committed transaction on some
    sets of nodes.
-   *No Conflicts After Commit*: the client can rely on the transaction to
    eventually be applied on all nodes without further conflicts, or get
    an abort directly informing the client of an error.

BDR provides a [Group Commit](group_commit.md) feature to guarante
durability and visibility by providing a variant of synchronous
replication.  This is very similar to Postgres' `synchronous_commit`
feature for physical standbys, but providing a lot more flexibility
for large scale distributed systems.

In addition to Group Commit, BDR also offers two additional modes
(which cannot currently be combined with Group Commit):

-   Commit At Most Once (CAMO). This feature solves the problem with knowing
    whether your transaction has COMMITed (and replicated) or not in case of
    node or network failures COMMIT. Normally, it might be hard to know whether
    or not the COMMIT was processed in. With this feature, your application can
    find out what happened, even if your new database connection is to a different node
    than your previous connection. For more info about this feature see the
    [Commit At Most Once](camo) chapter.
-   Eager Replication. This is an optional feature to check for conflicts prior
    to the commit. Every transaction is applied and prepared on *all nodes* simultaneously,
    and commits only if no replication conflicts are detected. This feature does
    reduce performance, but provides very strong consistency guarantees.
    For more info about this feature see the [Eager All-Node Replication](eager)
    chapter.

Postgres itself provides [Physical Streaming Replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/warm-standby.html#STREAMING-REPLICATION)
(PSR), which is uni-directional, but offers a [synchronous variant](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/warm-standby.html#SYNCHRONOUS-REPLICATION).
For backwards compatibility, BDR still supports configuring synchronous
replication via `synchronous_commit` and `synchronous_standby_names`, see
[Legacy Synchronous Replication](durability.md#legacy-synchronous-replication),
but the use of [Group Commit](group_commit.md) is recommended instead
in all cases.

This chapter covers the various forms of synchronous or eager
replication and its timing aspects.

## Terms and Definitions

This and subsequent chapters refer to BDR nodes taking different
roles.  These are implicitly assigned per transaction and are
unrelated even for concurrent transactions.

* the *origin* is the node that receives the transaction from the
  client or application. It is the node processing the transaction
  first, initiating replication to other BDR nodes and responding back
  to the client with a confirmation or an error.

* a *partner* node is a BDR node expected to confirm transactions
  either according to Group Commit or CAMO requirements.

* a *commit group* is the group of all BDR nodes involved in the
  commit, i.e. the origin and all of its partner nodes, which may be
  just a few or all peer nodes.

## Comparison

Most options for synchronous replication available to
BDR allow for different levels of synchronization, offering different
trade-offs between performance and protection against node or network
outages.

The following table summarizes what a client can expect from a peer
node replicated to after having received a COMMIT confirmation from
the origin node the transaction was issued to. The "Mode" column takes
on different meaning depending on the variant. For PSR and Legacy
Synchronous Replication with BDR, it refers to the
`synchronous_commit` setting. For CAMO, it refers to the
`bdr.enable_camo` setting. Lastly, for Group Commit, it refers to the
confirmation requirements of the
[commit scope configuration](group_commit#configuration).

*(1) written to the OS, durable if the OS remains running and only
Postgres crashes.*

*(2) unless switched to Local mode (if allowed) by setting
`synchronous_replication_availability` to `async'`, otherwise the
values for the asynchronous BDR default apply.*

*(3) not recommended, please consider using Group Commit instead.*

Reception ensures the normally operating peer will be able to
eventually apply the transaction without requiring any further
communication, i.e. even in the face of a full or partial network
outage.  A crash of a peer node may still require a re-transmission of
the transaction, as this confirmation does not involve persistent
storage. All modes considered synchronous provide this protection.

Visibility implies the transaction was applied remotely and all other
clients will see the results of the transaction on all nodes providing
this guarantee immediately after the commit is confirmed by the origin
node.  Without visibility, other clients connected may not see the
results of the transaction and experience stale reads.

Durability relates to the peer node's storage and provides protection
against loss of data after a crash and recovery of the peer node.
This can either relate to the reception of the data (as with Physical
Streaming Replication) or to visibility (as with Group Commit, CAMO
and Eager).  The former eliminates the need for retransmissions after
a crash, while the latter ensures visibility is maintained across
restarts.

## Internal Timing of Operations

For a better understanding of how the different modes work, it is
helpful to realize PSR and BDR apply transactions rather
differently.

With physical streaming replication, the order of operations is:

-   origin flushes a commit record to WAL, making the transaction
    visible locally
-   peer node receives changes and issues a write
-   peer flushes the received changes to disk
-   peer applies changes, making the transaction visible locally

With BDR, the order of operations is different:

-   origin flushes a commit record to WAL, making the transaction
    visible locally
-   peer node receives changes into its apply queue in memory
-   peer applies changes, making the transaction visible locally
-   peer persists the transaction by flushing to disk

For Group Commit, CAMO, and Eager, note that the origin node waits for
a certain number of confirmations prior to making the transaction
visible locally.  The order of operations is:

-   origin flushes a prepare or pre-commit record to WAL
-   peer node receives changes into its apply queue in memory
-   peer applies changes, making the transaction visible locally
-   peer persists the transaction by flushing to disk
-   origin commits and makes the transaction visible locally

The following table summarizes the differences.

| Variant      | Order of apply vs persist | replication before or after commit |
|:-------------|:-------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|
| PSR          |      persist first        | after WAL flush of commit record   |
| BDR          |       apply first         | after WAL flush of commit record   |
| Group Commit |       apply first         | before COMMIT on origin            |
| CAMO         |       apply first         | before COMMIT on origin            |
| Eager        |       apply first         | before COMMIT on origin            |

## Configuration

The following table provides an overview of which configuration
settings are required to be set to a non-default value (req) or
optional (opt), but affecting a specific variant.

| setting (GUC)                        |  Group Commit | CAMO  | Eager  | PSR (1) |
|--------------------------------------|:-------------:|:-----:|:------:|:-------:|
| synchronous_standby_names            |      n/a      |  n/a  |  n/a   |  req    |
| synchronous_commit                   |      n/a      |  n/a  |  n/a   |  opt    |
| synchronous_replication_availability |      n/a      |  opt  |  n/a   |  opt    |
| bdr.enable_camo                      |      n/a      |  req  |  n/a   |  n/a    |
| bdr.commit_scope                     |      req      |  n/a  |  opt   |  n/a    |
| bdr.global_commit_timeout            |      opt      |  opt  |  opt   |  n/a    |

*(1) values in this column apply also to `synchronous_commit` and
`synchronous_standby_names` being used in combination with BDR.*

## Planned Shutdown and Restarts


When using Group Commit with receive confirmations or CAMO in
combination with `remote_write`, care must be taken
with planned shutdown or restart.  By default, the apply queue is consumed
prior to shutting down.  However, in the `immediate` shutdown mode, the queue
is discarded at shutdown, leading to the stopped node "forgetting"
transactions in the queue. A concurrent failure of the origin node could
lead to loss of data, as if both nodes failed.

To ensure the apply queue gets flushed to disk, please use either
`smart` or `fast` shutdown for maintenance tasks. This maintains the
required synchronization level and prevents loss of data.

## Legacy Synchronous Replication using BDR

!!! Note
    This approach is not recommended.  Please consider using
    [Group Commit](group_commit.md) instead.

### Usage

To enable synchronous replication using BDR, the application
name of the relevant BDR peer nodes need to be added to
`synchronous_standby_names`.  The use of `FIRST x` or `ANY x` offers a
some flexibility, if this does not conflict with the requirements of
non-BDR standby nodes.

Once added, the level of synchronization can be configured per
transaction via `synchronous_commit`, which defaults to `on` - meaning that
adding to `synchronous_standby_names` already enables synchronous
replication.  Setting `synchronous_commit` to `local` or `off` turns
off synchronous replication.

Due to BDR applying the transaction before persisting it, the
values `on` and `remote_apply` are equivalent (for logical
replication).

### Limitations

BDR uses the same configuration (and internal mechanisms) as
Physical Streaming Replication, therefore the needs for (physical,
non-BDR) standbys needs to be considered when configuring synchronous
replication between BDR nodes.

### Migration to Group Commit

The Group Commit feature of BDR is configured independent of
`synchronous_commit` and `synchronous_standby_names`. Instead, the
`bdr.commit_scope` GUC allows to select the scope per transaction. And
instead of `synchronous_standby_names` configured on each node
individually, Group Commit uses globally synchronized Commit Scopes.

!!! Note
    While the grammar for `synchronous_standby_names` and Commit
    Scopes looks very similar, it is important to note that the former
    does not account for the origin node, but the latter does.
    Therefore, for example `synchronous_standby_names = 'ANY 1 (..)'`
    is equivalent to a Commit Scope of `ANY 2 (...)`.  This choice
    makes reasoning about majority easier and reflects that the origin
    node also contributes to the durability and visibility of the
    transaction.
