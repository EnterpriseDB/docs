title: Replication Sets
originalFilePath: repsets.md

---

A replication set is a group of tables which can be subscribed to by a BDR node.
Replication sets can be used to create more complex replication topologies
than regular symmetric multi-master where each node is exact copy of the other
nodes.

Every BDR group automatically creates a replication set with the same name as
the group itself. This replication set is the default replication set, which is
used for all user tables and DDL replication and all nodes are subscribed to it.
In other words, by default all user tables are replicated between all nodes.

## Using Replication Sets

Additional replication sets can be created using `create_replication_set()`,
specifying whether to include insert, update, delete or truncate actions.
An option exists to add existing tables to the set automatically, and
a second option defines whether to add tables automatically when they are
created.

You may also define manually which tables are added or removed from a
replication set.

Tables included in the replication set will be maintained when the node
joins the cluster and afterwards.

Once the node is joined, you may still remove tables from the replication
set, but adding new tables must be done via a resync operation.

By default, a newly defined replication set does not replicate DDL or BDR
administration function calls. Use the `replication_set_add_ddl_filter`
to define which commands will be replicated.

BDR creates replication set definitions on all nodes. Each node can then be
defined to publish and/or subscribe to each replication set using
`alter_node_replication_sets`.

Functions exist to alter these definitions later, or to drop the replication
set.

!!! Note
    Do not use the default replication set for selective replication.
    You should not drop or modify the default replication set on any of
    the BDR nodes in the cluster as it is also used by default for DDL
    replication and administration function calls.

## Behavior of Partitioned Tables

BDR supports partitioned tables transparently, meaning that a partitioned
table can be added to a replication set and
changes that involve any of the partitions will be replicated downstream.

!!! Note
    When partitions are replicated through a partitioned table, the
    statements executed directly on a partition are replicated as they
    were executed on the parent table. The exception is the `TRUNCATE` command
    which always replicates with the list of affected tables or partitions.

It's possible to add individual partitions to the replication set, in
which case they will be replicated like regular tables (to the table of the
same name as the partition on the downstream). This has some performance
advantages if the partitioning definition is the same on both provider and
subscriber, as the partitioning logic does not have to be executed.

!!! Note
    If a root partitioned table is part of any replication set, memberships
    of individual partitions are ignored, and only the membership of said root
    table will be taken into account.

## Behavior with Foreign Keys

A Foreign Key constraint ensures that each row in the referencing
table matches a row in the referenced table. Therefore, if the
referencing table is a member of a replication set, the referenced
table must also be a member of the same replication set.

The current version of BDR does not automatically check or enforce
this condition. It is therefore the responsibility of the database
administrator to make sure, when adding a table to a replication set,
that all the tables referenced via foreign keys are also added.

The following query can be used to list all the foreign keys and
replication sets that do not satisfy this requirement, i.e. such that
the referencing table is a member of the replication set, while the
referenced table is not:

```sql
SELECT t1.relname,
       t1.nspname,
       fk.conname,
       t1.set_name
  FROM bdr.tables AS t1
  JOIN pg_catalog.pg_constraint AS fk
    ON fk.conrelid = t1.relid
   AND fk.contype = 'f'
 WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT *
    FROM bdr.tables AS t2
   WHERE t2.relid = fk.confrelid
     AND t2.set_name = t1.set_name
);
```

The output of this query looks like the following:

```sql
 relname | nspname |  conname  | set_name
---------+---------+-----------+----------
 t2      | public  | t2_x_fkey | s2
(1 row)
```

This means that table `t2` is a member of replication set `s2`, but the
table referenced by the foreign key `t2_x_fkey` is not.

!!! Note
    The `TRUNCATE CASCADE` command takes into account the
    replication set membership before replicating the command, e.g.

```sql
TRUNCATE table1 CASCADE;
```

This will become a `TRUNCATE` without cascade on all the tables that are
part of the replication set only:

```sql
TRUNCATE table1, referencing_table1, referencing_table2 ...
```

## Replication Set Management

Management of replication sets.

Note that, with the exception of `bdr.alter_node_replication_sets`, the following
functions are considered to be `DDL` so DDL replication and global locking
applies to them, if that is currently active. See [DDL Replication].

### bdr.create_replication_set

This function creates a replication set.

Replication of this command is affected by DDL replication configuration
including DDL filtering settings.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.create_replication_set(set_name name,
                           replicate_insert boolean DEFAULT true,
                           replicate_update boolean DEFAULT true,
                           replicate_delete boolean DEFAULT true,
                           replicate_truncate boolean DEFAULT true,
                           autoadd_tables boolean DEFAULT false,
                           autoadd_existing boolean DEFAULT true)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` - name of the new replication set; must be unique across the BDR
     group
-   `replicate_insert` - indicates whether inserts into tables in this
    replication set should be replicated
-   `replicate_update` - indicates whether updates of tables in this
    replication set should be replicated
-   `replicate_delete` - indicates whether deletes from tables in this
    replication set should be replicated
-   `replicate_truncate` - indicates whether truncates of tables in this
    replication set should be replicated
-   `autoadd_tables` - indicates whether newly created (future) tables should be
    added to this replication set
-   `autoadd_existing` - indicates whether all existing user tables should be
    added to this replication set; this only has effect if `autoadd_tables` is
    set to true

#### Notes

By default, new replication sets do not replicate DDL or BDR administration
function calls. See [ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering) below on how to set
up DDL replication for replication sets. There is a preexisting DDL filter
set up for the default group replication set that replicates all DDL and admin
function calls, which is created when the group is created, but can be dropped
in case it's not desirable for the BDR group default replication set to replicate
DDL or the BDR administration function calls.

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This means
that the replication is affected by the [ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration.

The function will take a `DDL` global lock.

This function is transactional - the effects can be rolled back with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction and the changes are visible to the current
transaction.

### bdr.alter_replication_set

This function modifies the options of an existing replication set.

Replication of this command is affected by DDL replication configuration,
including DDL filtering settings.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_replication_set(set_name name,
                          replicate_insert boolean DEFAULT NULL,
                          replicate_update boolean DEFAULT NULL,
                          replicate_delete boolean DEFAULT NULL,
                          replicate_truncate boolean DEFAULT NULL,
                          autoadd_tables boolean DEFAULT NULL)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` - name of an existing replication set
-   `replicate_insert` - indicates whether inserts into tables in this
    replication set should be replicated
-   `replicate_update` - indicates whether updates of tables in this
    replication set should be replicated
-   `replicate_delete` - indicates whether deletes from tables in this
    replication set should be replicated
-   `replicate_truncate` - indicates whether truncates of tables in this
    replication set should be replicated
-   `autoadd_tables` - indicates whether newly created (future) tables should be
    added to this replication set

Any of the options that are set to NULL (the default) will remain the same as
before.

#### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This means
the replication is affected by the [ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration.

The function will take a `DDL` global lock.

This function is transactional - the effects can be rolled back with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction, and the changes are visible to the current
transaction.

### bdr.drop_replication_set

This function removes an existing replication set.

Replication of this command is affected by DDL replication configuration,
including DDL filtering settings.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.drop_replication_set(set_name name)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` - name of an existing replication set

#### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This means
the replication is affected by the [ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration.

The function will take a `DDL` global lock.

This function is transactional - the effects can be rolled back with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction, and the changes are visible to the current
transaction.

!!! Warning
    Do not drop a replication set which is being used by at least
    another node, because this will stop replication on that
    node. Should this happen, please unsubscribe the affected node
    from that replication set.  
    For the same reason, you should not drop a replication set if
    there is a join operation in progress, and the node being joined
    is a member of that replication set; replication set membership is
    only checked at the beginning of the join.  
    This happens because the information on replication set usage is
    local to each node, so that it can be configured on a node before
    it joins the group.

You can manage replication set subscription for a node using `alter_node_replication_sets` 
which is mentioned below.

### bdr.alter_node_replication_sets

This function changes which replication sets a node publishes and is subscribed to.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_node_replication_sets(node_name name,
                                set_names text[])
```

#### Parameters

-   `node_name` - which node to modify; currently has to be local node
-   `set_names` - array of replication sets to replicate to the specified
    node; an empty array will result in the use of the group default replication set

#### Notes

This function is only executed on the local node and is not replicated in any manner.

The replication sets listed are *not* checked for existence,
since this function is designed to be executed before the node joins. Be careful
to specify replication set names correctly to avoid errors.

This allows for calling the function not only on the node that is part of the
BDR group, but also on a node that has not joined any group yet in order to limit
what data is synchronized during the join. However, please note that schema is
*always fully synchronized* without regard to the replication sets setting,
meaning that all tables are copied across, not just the ones specified
in the replication set. Unwanted tables can be dropped by referring to
the `bdr.tables` catalog table. These might be removed automatically in later
versions of BDR. This is currently true even if the [ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration would otherwise prevent replication of DDL.

The replication sets that the node subscribes to after this call should be published
by the other node/s for actually replicating the changes from those nodes to
the node where this function is executed.

## Replication Set Membership

Tables can be added and removed to one or multiple replication sets. This only
affects replication of changes (DML) in those tables, schema changes (DDL) are
handled by DDL replication set filters (see [DDL Replication Filtering] below).

The replication uses the table membership in replication sets in combination
with the node replication sets configuration to determine which actions should be
replicated to which node. The decision is done using the union of all the
memberships and replication set options. This means that if a table is a member
of replication set A which replicates only INSERTs, and replication set B which
replicates only UPDATEs, both INSERTs and UPDATEs will be replicated if the
target node is also subscribed to both replication set A and B.

### bdr.replication_set_add_table

This function adds a table to a replication set.

This will add a table to replication set and start replication of changes
from this moment (or rather transaction commit). Any existing data the table
may have on a node will not be synchronized.

Replication of this command is affected by DDL replication configuration,
including DDL filtering settings.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.replication_set_add_table(relation regclass,
                              set_name name DEFAULT NULL,
                              columns text[] DEFAULT NULL,
                              row_filter text DEFAULT NULL)
```

#### Parameters

-   `relation` - name or Oid of a table
-   `set_name` - name of the replication set; if NULL (the default) then the BDR
     group default replication set is used
-   `columns` - reserved for future use (currently does nothing and must be NULL)
-   `row_filter` - SQL expression to be used for filtering the replicated rows;
    if this expression is not defined (i.e. NULL - the default) then all rows are sent

The `row_filter` specifies an expression producing a Boolean result, with NULLs.
Expressions evaluating to True or Unknown will replicate the row; a False value
will not replicate the row. Expressions cannot contain subqueries, nor refer to
variables other than columns of the current row being replicated. No system
columns may be referenced.

`row_filter` executes on the origin node, not on the target node. This puts an
additional CPU overhead on replication for this specific table, but will
completely avoid sending data for filtered rows, hence reducing network
bandwidth and apply overhead on the target node.

`row_filter` will never remove `TRUNCATE` commands for a specific table.
`TRUNCATE` commands can be filtered away at the replication set level; see
earlier.

It is possible to replicate just some columns of a table, see
[Replicating between nodes with differences](appusage).

#### Notes

This function uses same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This means
that the replication is affected by the [ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration.

The function will take a `DML` global lock on the relation that is being
added to the replication set if the `row_filter` is not NULL, otherwise
it will take just a `DDL` global lock.

This function is transactional - the effects can be rolled back with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction and the changes are visible to the current
transaction.

### bdr.replication_set_remove_table

This function removes a table from the replication set.

Replication of this command is affected by DDL replication configuration,
including DDL filtering settings.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.replication_set_remove_table(relation regclass,
                                 set_name name DEFAULT NULL)
```

#### Parameters

-   `relation` - name or Oid of a table
-   `set_name` - name of the replication set; if NULL (the default) then the BDR
     group default replication set is used

#### Notes

This function uses same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This means
the replication is affected by the [ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration.

The function will take a `DDL` global lock.

This function is transactional - the effects can be rolled back with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction and the changes are visible to the current
transaction.

## Listing Replication Sets

Existing replication sets can be listed with the following query:

```sql
SELECT set_name
FROM bdr.replication_sets;
```

This query can be used to list all the tables in a given replication
set:

```sql
SELECT nspname, relname
FROM bdr.tables
WHERE set_name = 'myrepset';
```

In the section [Behavior with Foreign Keys] above, we report a
query that lists all the foreign keys whose referenced table is not
included in the same replication set as the referencing table.

Use the following SQL to show those replication sets that the
current node publishes and subscribes from:

```sql
SELECT s.node_id,
        s.node_name,
        COALESCE(
                i.pub_repsets, s.pub_repsets
        ) AS pub_repsets,
        COALESCE(
                i.sub_repsets, s.sub_repsets
        ) AS sub_repsets
FROM bdr.local_node_summary s
INNER JOIN bdr.node_local_info i ON i.node_id = s.node_id;
```

This produces output like this:

```sql
  node_id   | node_name |    pub_repsets     |   sub_repsets
------------+-----------+----------------------------------------
 1834550102 | s01db01   | {bdrglobal,bdrs01} | {bdrglobal,bdrs01}
(1 row)
```

To get the same query executed on against all nodes in the cluster, thus getting
which replication sets are associated to all nodes at the same time, we can use
the following query:

```sql
WITH node_repsets AS (
  SELECT jsonb_array_elements(
    bdr.run_on_all_nodes($$
        SELECT s.node_id,
        s.node_name,
        COALESCE(
                i.pub_repsets, s.pub_repsets
        ) AS pub_repsets,
        COALESCE(
                i.sub_repsets, s.sub_repsets
        ) AS sub_repsets
		FROM bdr.local_node_summary s
		INNER JOIN bdr.node_local_info i
		ON i.node_id = s.node_id;
    $$)::jsonb
  ) AS j
)
SELECT j->'response'->'command_tuples'->0->>'node_id' AS node_id,
       j->'response'->'command_tuples'->0->>'node_name' AS node_name,
       j->'response'->'command_tuples'->0->>'pub_repsets' AS pub_repsets,
       j->'response'->'command_tuples'->0->>'sub_repsets' AS sub_repsets
FROM node_repsets;;
```

This will show, for example:

```sql
  node_id   | node_name |    pub_repsets     |    sub_repsets
------------+-----------+----------------------------------------
 933864801  | s02db01   | {bdrglobal,bdrs02} | {bdrglobal,bdrs02}
 1834550102 | s01db01   | {bdrglobal,bdrs01} | {bdrglobal,bdrs01}
 3898940082 | s01db02   | {bdrglobal,bdrs01} | {bdrglobal,bdrs01}
 1102086297 | s02db02   | {bdrglobal,bdrs02} | {bdrglobal,bdrs02}
(4 rows)
```

## DDL Replication Filtering

By default, the replication of all supported DDL happens via the default BDR
group replication set. This is achieved by the existence of a DDL filter with
the same name as the BDR group, which is automatically added to the default BDR
group replication set when the BDR group is created.

The above can be adjusted by changing the DDL replication filters for
all existing replication sets. These filters are independent of table
membership in the replication sets. Just like data changes, each DDL statement
will be replicated only once, no matter if it is matched by multiple filters on
multiple replication sets.

You can list existing DDL filters with the following query, which
shows for each filter the regular expression applied to the command
tag and to the role name:

```sql
SELECT * FROM bdr.ddl_replication;
```

The following functions can be used to manipulate DDL filters. Note
that they are considered to be `DDL`, and therefore subject to DDL
replication and global locking.

### bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter

This function adds a DDL filter to a replication set.

Any DDL that matches the given filter will be replicated to any node which
is subscribed to that set. This also affects replication of BDR admin functions.

Note that this does not prevent execution of DDL on any node, it only
alters whether DDL is replicated, or not, to other nodes. So if two nodes have
a replication filter between them that excludes all index commands, then
index commands can still be executed freely by directly connecting to
each node and executing the desired DDL on that node.

The DDL filter can specify a `command_tag` and `role_name` to allow
replication of only some DDL statements. The `command_tag` is same as those
used by [EVENT TRIGGERs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/event-trigger-matrix.html)
for regular PostgreSQL commands. A typical example might be to create a
filter that prevents additional index commands on a logical standby from
being replicated to all other nodes.

The BDR admin functions use can be filtered using a tagname matching the
qualified function name (for example `bdr.replication_set_add_table` will be the
command tag for the function of the same name). For example, this allows all BDR
functions to be filtered using `bdr.*`.

The `role_name` is used for matching against the current role which is executing
the command. Both `command_tag` and `role_name` are evaluated as regular
expressions which are case sensitive.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter(set_name name,
                                   ddl_filter_name text,
                                   command_tag text,
                                   role_name text DEFAULT NULL)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` - name of the replication set; if NULL then the BDR
     group default replication set is used
-   `ddl_filter_name` - name of the DDL filter; this must be unique across the
    whole BDR group
-   `command_tag` - regular expression for matching command tags; NULL means
    match everything
-   `role_name` - regular expression for matching role name; NULL means
    match all roles

#### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This means
that the replication is affected by the [ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration. Please note - this means that replication of changes to ddl
filter configuration is affected by existing ddl filter configuration!

The function will take a `DDL` global lock.

This function is transactional - the effects can be rolled back with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction, and the changes are visible to the current
transaction.

To view which replication filters are defined, use the view `bdr.ddl_replication`.

#### Examples

To include only BDR admin functions, define a filter like this:

```sql
SELECT bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter('mygroup', 'mygroup_admin', $$bdr\..*$$);
```

To exclude everything apart from index DDL:

```sql
SELECT bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter('mygroup', 'index_filter',
				'^(?!(CREATE INDEX|DROP INDEX|ALTER INDEX)).*');
```

To include all operations on tables and indexes, but exclude all others, add
two filters, one for tables, one for indexes. This illustrates that
multiple filters provide the union of all allowed DDL commands:

```sql
SELECT bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter('bdrgroup','index_filter', '^((?!INDEX).)*$');
SELECT bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter('bdrgroup','table_filter', '^((?!TABLE).)*$');
```

### bdr.replication_set_remove_ddl_filter

This function removes the DDL filter from a replication set.

Replication of this command is affected by DDL replication configuration,
including DDL filtering settings themselves!

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.replication_set_remove_ddl_filter(set_name name,
                                      ddl_filter_name text)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` - name of the replication set; if NULL then the BDR
     group default replication set is used
-   `ddl_filter_name` - name of the DDL filter to remove

#### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This
means that the replication is affected by the
[ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering) configuration. Please note
that this means that replication of changes to the DDL filter configuration is
affected by the existing DDL filter configuration.

The function will take a `DDL` global lock.

This function is transactional - the effects can be rolled back with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction, and the changes are visible to the current
transaction.
