BDR management is primarily accomplished via SQL-callable functions.
All functions in BDR are exposed in the `bdr` schema. Any calls to these
functions should be schema-qualified, rather than putting `bdr` in the
`search_path`.

This page contains additional system functions that are not described in the
other sections of the documentation.

## Version Information Functions

### bdr.bdr_version

This function retrieves the textual representation of the BDR version that is
currently in use.

### bdr.bdr_version_num

This function retrieves a numerical representation of the BDR version that is
currently in use. Version numbers are monotonically increasing, allowing this
value to be used for less-than and greater-than comparisons.

The following formula is used to turn the version number consisting of
major version, minor verion and patch release into a single numerical
value:

```
MAJOR_VERSION * 10000 + MINOR_VERSION * 100 + PATCH_RELEASE
```

## System and Progress Information Parameters

BDR exposes some parameters that can be queried via `SHOW` in `psql`
or using `PQparameterStatus` (or equivalent) from a client
application. This section lists all such parameters BDR reports to.

### bdr.local_node_id

Upon session initialization, this is set to the node id the client is
connected to.  This allows an application to figure out what node it
is connected to even behind a transparent proxy.

It is also used in combination with CAMO, see the
[Connection pools and proxies](CAMO#connection-pools-and-proxies) section.

### bdr.last_committed_lsn

After every `COMMIT` of an asynchronous transaction, this parameter is updated to
point to the end of the commit record on the origin node. In
combination with `bdr.wait_for_apply_queue`, this allows applications
to perform causal reads across multiple nodes, i.e. to wait until a transaction
becomes remotely visible.

### transaction_id

As soon as Postgres assigns a transaction id, this parameter is
updated to show the transaction id just assigned, if CAMO is enabled.

## Consensus Function

### bdr.consensus_disable

Disables the consensus worker on the local node until server restart or until
it's re-enabled using `bdr.consensus_enable` (whichever happens first).

!!! Warning
    Disabling consensus will disable some features of BDR and eventually
    will impact availability of the BDR cluster if left disabled for prolonged
    periods of time. This function should only be used in coordination with
    Technical Support.

### bdr.consensus_enable

Re-enabled disabled consensus worker on local node.

### bdr.consensus_proto_version

Returns currently used consensus protocol version by the local node.

Needed by the BDR group reconfiguration internal mechanisms.

### bdr.consensus_snapshot_export

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.consensus_snapshot_export(version integer DEFAULT NULL)
```

Generate a new BDR consensus snapshot from the currently committed-and-applied
state of the local node and return it as bytea.

By default, a snapshot for the highest supported Raft version is
exported. But that can be overridden by passing an explicit `version`
number.

The exporting node does not have to be the current Raft leader, nor does it
need to be completely up to date with the latest state on the leader. However,
such snapshot might not be accepted by `bdr.consensus_snapshot_import()`
(see bellow).

The new snapshot is not automatically stored to the local node's
`bdr.local_consensus_snapshot` table. It's only returned to the caller.

The generated snapshot may be passed to `bdr.consensus_snapshot_import()` on
any other node(s) in the same BDR nodegroup that is behind the exporting node's
raft log position.

The local BDR consensus worker must be disabled for this function to work.
Typical usage is:

```
 SELECT bdr.bdr_consensus_disable();
 \copy (SELECT * FROM bdr.consensus_snapshot_export()) TO 'my_node_consensus_snapshot.data'
 SELECT bdr.bdr_consensus_enable();
```

While the BDR consensus worker is disabled, DDL locking attempts on the node
will fail or time out, galloc sequences will not get new values, Eager and CAMO
transactions will pause or ERROR, and other functionality that needs the distributed
consensus system will be disrupted. The required downtime is generally very brief.

Depending on the use case, it may be practical to extract a snapshot that
already exists from the `snapshot` field of the `bdr.local_consensus_snapshot`
table and use that instead. Doing so does not require that the consensus worker
be stopped.

### bdr.consensus_snapshot_import

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.consensus_snapshot_import(IN snapshot bytea)
```

Import a consensus snapshot which was exported by
`bdr.consensus_snapshot_export()`, usually from another node in the same BDR
nodegroup.

It's also possible to use a snapshot extracted directly from the `snapshot`
field of the `bdr.local_consensus_snapshot` table on another node.

This function is useful for resetting a BDR node's catalog state to known good
state in case of corruption or user mistake.

The snapshot can be imported if the importing node's `apply_index` is less than
or equal to the snapshot-exporting node's `commit_index` at the time the
snapshot was generated. See `bdr.get_raft_status()`. A node that cannot accept
the snapshot because its logs is already too far ahead will raise an `ERROR`
and make no changes. The imported snapshot does not have to be completely
up-to-date, as once the snapshot is imported the node will fetch the remaining
changes from the current leader.

The BDR consensus worker must be disabled on the importing node for this
function to work. See notes on `bdr.consensus_snapshot_export()` for details.

It's possible to use this to force the local node to generate a new Raft
snapshot by running:

```
SELECT bdr.consensus_snapshot_import(bdr.consensus_snapshot_export());
```

This may also cause it to truncate its Raft logs up to the current
applied log position.

### bdr.consensus_snapshot_verify

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.consensus_snapshot_verify(IN snapshot bytea)
```

Verify the given consensus snapshot which was exported by
`bdr.consensus_snapshot_export()`. The snapshot header contains the
version with which is was generated and the node will try to verify it
against the same version.

The snapshot may have been exported on the same node or any other node
in the cluster. If the node verifying the snapshot does not support the
version of the exported snapshot, then an error will be raised.

### bdr.get_consensus_status

Returns status information about the current consensus (Raft) worker.

### bdr.get_raft_status

Returns status information about the current consensus (Raft) worker.
Alias for `bdr.get_consensus_status`.

### bdr.raft_leadership_transfer

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.raft_leadership_transfer(IN node_name text, IN wait_for_completion boolean)
```

Request the node identified by `node_name` to be the Raft leader. The
request can be initiated from any of the BDR nodes and it will be
internally forwarded to the current leader to transfer the leadership to
the designated node. The designated node must be an ACTIVE BDR node and
with full voting rights.

If `wait_for_completion` is false, the request is served on
best-efforts basis.  If the node can't become a leader within
`bdr.raft_election_timeout` period, then some other capable node will
become the leader again. Also, the leadership can change over the
period of time per Raft protocol. A true return result only indicates
the request had been submitted successfully.

If `wait_for_completion` is `true` then the function will wait until
the given node becomes the new leader and possibly wait infinitely if
the requested node fails to become Raft leader (e.g. due to network
issues). It is therefore recommended to always set a `statement_timeout`
in combination with `wait_for_completion` to prevent an infinite loop.

## Utility Functions

### bdr.wait_slot_confirm_lsn

Allows the user to wait until the last write on this session has been replayed
to one or all nodes.

Waits until a slot passes certain LSN. If no position is supplied, the
current write position is used on the local node.

If no slot name is passed, it will wait until all BDR slots pass the LSN.

The function polls every 1000ms for changes from other nodes.

If a slot is dropped concurrently the wait will end for that slot.
If a node is currently down and is not updating its slot then the wait will continue.
You may wish to set `statement_timeout` to complete earlier in that case.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.wait_slot_confirm_lsn(slot_name text DEFAULT NULL, target_lsn pg_lsn DEFAULT NULL)
```

#### Parameters

-   `slot_name` - name of replication slot, or if NULL, all BDR slots (only)
-   `target_lsn` - LSN to wait for, or if NULL, use the current write LSN on the 
    local node

### bdr.wait_for_apply_queue

The function `bdr.wait_for_apply_queue` allows a BDR node to wait for
the local application of certain transactions originating from a given
BDR node.  It will return only after all transactions from that peer
node are applied locally.  An application or a proxy can use this
function to prevent stale reads.

For convenience, BDR provides a special variant of this function for
CAMO and the CAMO partner node, see
[bdr.wait_for_camo_partner_queue](camo#wait-for-consumption-of-the-apply-queue-from-the-camo-partner).

In case a specific LSN is given, that's the point in the recovery
stream from the peer to wait for.  This can be used in combination
with `bdr.last_committed_lsn` retrieved from that peer node on a
previous or concurrent connection.

If the given `target_lsn` is NULL, this function checks the local
receive buffer and uses the LSN of the last transaction received from
the given peer node.  Effectively waiting for all transactions already
received to be applied.  This is especially useful in case the peer
node has failed and it's not known which transactions have been sent.
Note that in this case, transactions that are still in transit or
buffered on the sender side are not waited for.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.wait_for_apply_queue(peer_node_name TEXT, target_lsn pg_lsn)
```

#### Parameters

-   `peer_node_name` - the name of the peer node from which incoming
    transactions are expected to be queued and which should be waited
    for.  If NULL, waits for all peer node's apply queue to be consumed.
-   `target_lsn` - the LSN in the replication stream from the peer node
    to wait for, usually learned via `bdr.last_committed_lsn` from the
    peer node.

### bdr.get_node_sub_receive_lsn

This function can be used on a subscriber to get the last LSN that has
been received from the given origin. Either filtered to take into
account only relevant LSN increments for transactions to be applied or
unfiltered.

The difference between the output of this function and the output of
`bdr.get_node_sub_apply_lsn()` measures the size of the corresponding
apply queue.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.get_node_sub_receive_lsn(node_name name, committed bool default true)
```

#### Parameters

-   `node_name` - the name of the node which is the source of the
    replication stream whose LSN we are retrieving/
-   `committed` - the default (true) makes this function take into
    account only commits of transactions received, rather than the last
    LSN overall; including actions that have no effect on the subscriber
    node.

### bdr.get_node_sub_apply_lsn

This function can be used on a subscriber to get the last LSN that has
been received and applied from the given origin.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.get_node_sub_apply_lsn(node_name name)
```

#### Parameters

-   `node_name` - the name of the node which is the source of the
    replication stream whose LSN we are retrieving.

### bdr.run_on_all_nodes

Function to run a query on all nodes.

!!! Warning
    This function will run an arbitrary query on a remote node with the
    privileges of the user used for the internode connections as specified in the
    node's DSN. Caution needs to be taken when granting privileges to this function.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.run_on_all_nodes(query text)
```

#### Parameters

-   `query` - arbitrary query to be executed.

#### Notes

This function will connect to other nodes and execute the query, returning
a result from each of them in json format. Multiple rows may be returned from
each node, encoded as a json array. Any errors, such as being unable to
connect because a node is down, will be shown in the response field.
No explicit statement_timeout or other runtime parameters are set, so
defaults will be used.

This function does not go through normal replication, it uses direct client
connection to all known nodes. By default, the connection is created
with bdr.ddl_replication = off, since the command are already being sent
to all of the nodes in the cluster.

Be careful when using this function since you risk breaking replication
and causing inconsistencies between nodes. Use either transparent DDL
replication or `bdr.replicate_ddl_command()` to replicate DDL.
DDL may be blocked in a future release.

#### Example

It's useful to use this function in monitoring, for example in the following
query:

```sql
SELECT bdr.run_on_all_nodes($$
	SELECT local_slot_name, origin_name, target_name, replay_lag_size
      FROM bdr.node_slots
     WHERE origin_name IS NOT NULL
$$);
```

...will return something like this on a two node cluster:

```
[
    {
        "dsn": "host=node1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres ",
        "node_id": "2232128708",
        "response": {
            "command_status": "SELECT 1",
            "command_tuples": [
                {
                    "origin_name": "node1",
                    "target_name": "node2",
                    "local_slot_name": "bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup_node2",
                    "replay_lag_size": "0 bytes"
                }
            ]
        },
        "node_name": "node1"
    },
    {
        "dsn": "host=node2 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres ",
        "node_id": "2058684375",
        "response": {
            "command_status": "SELECT 1",
            "command_tuples": [
                {
                    "origin_name": "node2",
                    "target_name": "node1",
                    "local_slot_name": "bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup_node1",
                    "replay_lag_size": "0 bytes"
                }
            ]
        },
        "node_name": "node2"
    }
]
```

### bdr.run_on_nodes

Function to run a query on a specified list of nodes.

!!! Warning
    This function will run an arbitrary query on remote nodes with the
    privileges of the user used for the internode connections as specified in the
    node's DSN. Caution needs to be taken when granting privileges to this function.

#### Synopsis

```postgresql
bdr.run_on_nodes(node_names text[], query text)
```

#### Parameters

-   `node_names` - text ARRAY of node names where query will be executed.
-   `query` - arbitrary query to be executed.

#### Notes

This function will connect to other nodes and execute the query, returning
a result from each of them in json format. Multiple rows may be returned from
each node, encoded as a json array. Any errors, such as being unable to
connect because a node is down, will be shown in the response field.
No explicit statement_timeout or other runtime parameters are set, so
defaults will be used.

This function does not go through normal replication, it uses direct client
connection to all known nodes. By default, the connection is created
with bdr.ddl_replication = off, since the command are already being sent
to all of the nodes in the cluster.

Be careful when using this function since you risk breaking replication
and causing inconsistencies between nodes. Use either transparent DDL
replication or `bdr.replicate_ddl_command()` to replicate DDL.
DDL may be blocked in a future release.

### bdr.run_on_group

Function to run a query on a group of nodes.

!!! Warning

```

#### Parameters

-   `node_group_name` - name of node group where query will be executed.
-   `query` - arbitrary query to be executed.

#### Notes

This function will connect to other nodes and execute the query, returning
a result from each of them in json format. Multiple rows may be returned from
each node, encoded as a json array. Any errors, such as being unable to

and causing inconsistencies between nodes. Use either transparent DDL
replication or `bdr.replicate_ddl_command()` to replicate DDL.
DDL may be blocked in a future release.

### bdr.global_lock_table

This function will acquire a global DML locks on a given table.
See [DDL Locking Details](ddl#ddl-locking-details) for information
about global DML lock.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.global_lock_table(relation regclass)
```

#### Parameters

-   `relation` - name or Oid of the relation to be locked.

#### Notes

This function will acquire the global DML lock independently of the
`ddl_locking` setting.

The `bdr.global_lock_table` function requires `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `TRUNCATE`
privilege on the locked `relation`, unless `bdr.backwards_compatibility` is
set is set to 30618 or below.

### bdr.wait_for_xid_progress

This function can be used to wait for the given transaction (identified
by it's XID) originated at the given node (identified by it's node id)
to make enough progress on the cluster. The progress is defined as the
transaction being applied on a node and this node having seen all
other replication changes done before the transaction is applied.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.wait_for_xid_progress(origin_node_id oid, origin_topxid int4, allnodes boolean DEFAULT true)
```

#### Parameters

-   `origin_node_id` - node id of the node where the transaction was
    originated.

-   `origin_topxid` - XID of the transaction.

-   `allnodes` - if `true` then wait for the transaction to progress on
    all nodes. Otherwise only wait for the current node.

#### Notes

The function can be used only for those transactions that have
replicated a DDL command because only those transactions are tracked
currently. If a wrong `origin_node_id` or `origin_topxid` is supplied,
the function may wait forever or until `statement_timeout` is hit.

### bdr.local_group_slot_name

Returns the name of the group slot on the local node.

#### Example

```sql
bdrdb=# SELECT bdr.local_group_slot_name();
 local_group_slot_name 
-----------------------
 bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup
```

### bdr.node_group_type

Returns the type of the given node group. Returned value is same as what
was passed to `bdr.create_node_group()` when the node group was created,
except `normal` is returned if the `node_group_type` was passed as NULL
when the group was created.

#### Example

```sql
bdrdb=# SELECT bdr.node_group_type('bdrgroup');
 node_group_type
-----------------
 normal
```

## Global Advisory Locks

BDR supports global advisory locks. These locks are very similar to 
the advisory locks available in PostgreSQL except that the
advisory locks supported by BDR are global in nature. They follow semantics
similar to DDL locks. So an advisory lock is obtained by majority consensus and
hence can be used even if one or more nodes are down or lagging behind, as long
as a majority of all nodes can work together.

Currently we only support EXCLUSIVE locks. So if another node or another
backend on the same node has already acquired the advisory lock on the object,
then other nodes or backends must wait for the lock to be released.

Advisory lock is transactional in nature. So the lock is automatically released
when the transaction ends unless it is explicitly released before the end of
the transaction, in which case it will be available as soon as it's released.
Session level advisory locks are not currently supported.

Global advisory locks are re-entrant. So if the same resource is locked three
times it must then be unlocked three times to be released for other sessions'
use.

### bdr.global_advisory_lock

This function acquires an EXCLUSIVE lock on the provided object. If the lock is
not available, then it will wait until the lock becomes available or the
`bdr.global_lock_timeout` is reached.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.global_advisory_lock(key bigint)
```

#### parameters

-   `key` - the object on which an advisory lock is acquired.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.global_advisory_lock(key1 integer, key2 integer)
```

#### parameters

-   `key1` - first part of the composite key.
-   `key2` - second part of the composite key.

### bdr.global_advisory_unlock

This function released previously acquired lock on the application defined
source. The lock must have been previously obtained in the same transaction by
the application, otherwise an ERROR is raised.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.global_advisory_unlock(key bigint)
```

#### parameters

-   `key` - the object on which advisory lock is acquired.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.global_advisory_unlock(key1 integer, key2 integer)
```

#### parameters

-   `key1` - first part of the composite key.
-   `key2` - second part of the composite key.
