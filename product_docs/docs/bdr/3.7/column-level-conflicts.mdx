By default, conflicts are resolved at row level. That is, when changes
from two nodes conflict, we pick either the local or remote tuple and
discard the other one. For example, we may compare commit timestamps for
the two conflicting changes and keep the newer one. This ensures that all
nodes converge to the same result, and establishes commit-order-like
semantics on the whole cluster.

However, in some cases it may be appropriate to resolve conflicts at
the column-level rather than the row-level.

Consider a simple example, where we have a table "t" with two integer
columns "a" and "b", and a single row `(1,1)`. Assume that on one node
we execute:

```sql
UPDATE t SET a = 100
```

...while on another node we concurrently (before receiving the preceding
`UPDATE`) execute:

```sql
UPDATE t SET b = 100
```

This results in an `UPDATE-UPDATE` conflict. With the `update_if_newer`
conflict resolution, we compare the commit timestamps and keep the new
row version. Assuming the second node committed last, we end up with
`(1,100)`, effectively discarding the change to column "a".

For many use cases this is the desired and expected behaviour, but for
some this may be an issue - consider for example a multi-node cluster
where each part of the application is connected to a different node,
updating a dedicated subset of columns in a shared table. In that case,
the different components may step on each other's toes, overwriting
their changes.

For such use cases, it may be more appropriate to resolve conflicts on
a given table at the column-level. To achieve that, BDR will track
the timestamp of the last change for each column separately, and use that
to pick the most recent value (essentially `update_if_newer`).

Applied to the previous example, we'll end up with `(100,100)` on both
nodes, despite neither of the nodes ever seeing such a row.

When thinking about column-level conflict resolution, it may be useful
to see tables as vertically partitioned, so that each update affects
data in only one slice. This eliminates conflicts between changes to
different subsets of columns. In fact, vertical partitioning may even
be a practical alternative to column-level conflict resolution.

Column-level conflict resolution requires the table to have `REPLICA
IDENTITY FULL`. The `bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection` function does check
that, and will fail with an error otherwise.

## Enabling and Disabling Column-Level Conflict Resolution

The Column-Level Conflict Resolution is managed by the
[bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection()](conflicts#bdralter_table_conflict_detection)
function.

### Example

To illustrate how the `bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection()` is used, consider
this example that creates a trivial table `test_table` and then enable
column-level conflict resolution on it:

```sql
db=# CREATE TABLE my_app.test_table (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, val INT);
CREATE TABLE

db=# ALTER TABLE my_app.test_table REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
ALTER TABLE

db=# SELECT bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection(
db(# 'my_app.test_table'::regclass, 'column_modify_timestamp', 'cts');
 alter_table_conflict_detection 
--------------------------------
 t

db=# \d my_app.test_table
```

You will see that the function adds a new `cts` column (as specified in
the function call), but it also created two triggers ( `BEFORE INSERT`
and `BEFORE UPDATE` ) that are responsible for maintaining timestamps
in the new column before each change.

Also worth mentioning is that the new column specifies `NOT NULL`
with a default value, which means that `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN`
does not perform a table rewrite.

*Note*: We discourage using columns with the `bdr.column_timestamps` data type
for other purposes as it may have various negative effects
(it switches the table to column-level conflict resolution, which will
not work correctly without the triggers etc.).

### Listing Table with Column-Level Conflict Resolution

Tables having column-level conflict resolution enabled can be listed
with the following query, which detects the presence of a column of
type `bdr.column_timestamp`:

```sql
SELECT nc.nspname, c.relname
FROM pg_attribute a
JOIN (pg_class c JOIN pg_namespace nc ON c.relnamespace = nc.oid)
  ON a.attrelid = c.oid
JOIN (pg_type t  JOIN pg_namespace nt ON t.typnamespace = nt.oid)
  ON a.atttypid = t.oid
WHERE NOT pg_is_other_temp_schema(nc.oid)
  AND nt.nspname = 'bdr'
  AND t.typname = 'column_timestamps'
  AND NOT a.attisdropped
  AND c.relkind IN ('r', 'v', 'f', 'p');
```

### bdr.column_timestamps_create

This function creates column-level conflict resolution. This is called within
`column_timestamp_enable`.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.column_timestamps_create(p_source cstring, p_timestamp timestampstz)
```

#### Parameters

-   `p_source` - The two options are 'current' or 'commit'.
-   `p_timestamp` - Timestamp is dependent on the source chosen: if 'commit',
    then TIMESTAMP_SOURCE_COMMIT; if 'current', then TIMESTAMP_SOURCE_CURRENT.

## DDL Locking

When enabling or disabling column timestamps on a table, the code uses
DDL locking to ensure that there are no pending changes from before the
switch, to ensure we only see conflicts with either timestamps in both
tuples or neither of them. Otherwise, the code might unexpectedly see
timestamps in the local tuple and NULL in the remote one. It also
ensures that the changes are resolved the same way (column-level or
row-level) on all nodes.

## Current vs Commit Timestamp

An important question is what timestamp to assign to modified columns.

By default, the timestamp assigned to modified columns is the current
timestamp, as if obtained from `clock_timestamp`. This is simple, and
for many cases it is perfectly correct (e.g. when the conflicting rows
modify non-overlapping subsets of columns).

It may however have various unexpected effects:

-   The timestamp changes during statement execution, so if an `UPDATE`
    affects multiple rows, each will get a slightly different timestamp.
    This means that the effects of concurrent changes may get "mixed" in various
    ways (depending on how exactly the changes performed on different
    nodes interleave).

-   The timestamp is unrelated to the commit timestamp, and using it to
    resolve conflicts means that the result is not equivalent to the commit order,
    which means it likely is not serializable.

Note: We may add statement and transaction timestamps in the future,
which would address issues with mixing effects of concurrent statements or
transactions. Still, neither of these options can ever produce results
equivalent to commit order.

It is possible to also use the actual commit timestamp, although this
feature is currently considered experimental. To use the commit timestamp,
set the last parameter to `true` when enabling column-level conflict
resolution:

```sql
SELECT bdr.column_timestamps_enable('test_table'::regclass, 'cts', true);
```

This can also be disabled using `bdr.column_timestamps_disable`.

Commit timestamps currently have a couple of restrictions that are
explained in the "Limitations" section.

## Inspecting Column Timestamps

The column storing timestamps for modified columns is maintained
automatically by triggers, and must not be modified directly. It may
be useful to inspect the current timestamps value, for example while
investigating how a particular conflict was resolved.

There are three functions for this purpose:

-   `bdr.column_timestamps_to_text(bdr.column_timestamps)`

    This function returns a human-readable representation of the timestamp mapping, and
    is used when casting the value to `text`:

```sql
db=# select cts::text from test_table;
                                                 cts
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {source: current, default: 2018-09-23 19:24:52.118583+02, map: [2 : 2018-09-23 19:25:02.590677+02]}
(1 row)

```

-   `bdr.column_timestamps_to_jsonb(bdr.column_timestamps)`

    This function turns a JSONB representation of the timestamps mapping, and is used
    when casting the value to `jsonb`:

```sql
db=# select jsonb_pretty(cts::jsonb) from test_table;
                   jsonb_pretty                    
---------------------------------------------------
 {                                                +
     "map": {                                     +
         "2": "2018-09-23T19:24:52.118583+02:00"  +
     },                                           +
     "source": "current",                         +
     "default": "2018-09-23T19:24:52.118583+02:00"+
 }
(1 row)
```

-   `bdr.column_timestamps_resolve(bdr.column_timestamps, xid)`

    This function updates the mapping with the commit timestamp for the attributes modified
    by the most recent transaction (if it already committed). This only
    matters when using the commit timestamp. For example in this case, the last
    transaction updated the second attribute (with `attnum = 2`):

```sql
test=# select cts::jsonb from test_table;
                                                                  cts
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {"map": {"2": "2018-09-23T19:29:55.581823+02:00"}, "source": "commit", "default": "2018-09-23T19:29:55.581823+02:00", "modified": [2]}
(1 row)

db=# select bdr.column_timestamps_resolve(cts, xmin)::jsonb from test_table;
                                               column_timestamps_resolve
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {"map": {"2": "2018-09-23T19:29:55.581823+02:00"}, "source": "commit", "default": "2018-09-23T19:29:55.581823+02:00"}
(1 row)
```

## Handling column conflicts using CRDT Data Types

By default, column-level conflict resolution simply picks the value with
a higher timestamp and discards the other one. It is however possible to
reconcile the conflict in different (more elaborate) ways, for example
using CRDT types that allow "merging" the conflicting values without
discarding any information.

While pglogical does not include any such data types, it allows adding
them separately and registering them in a catalog `crdt_handlers`. Aside
from the usual data type functions (input/output, ...) each CRDT type
has to implement a merge function, which takes exactly three arguments
(local value, old remote value, new remote value) and produces a value
merging information from those three values.

## Limitations

-   The attributes modified by an `UPDATE` are determined by comparing the
    old and new row in a trigger. This means that if the attribute does
    not change a value, it will not be detected as modified even if it is
    explicitly set. For example, `UPDATE t SET a = a` will not mark `a` as
    modified for any row. Similarly, `UPDATE t SET a = 1` will not mark
    `a` as modified for rows that are already set to `1`.

-   For `INSERT` statements, we do not have any old row to compare the new
    one to, so we consider all attributes to be modified and assign them
    a new timestamp. This applies even for columns that were not included
    in the `INSERT` statement and received default values. We could detect
    which attributes have a default value, but it is not possible to decide if
    it was included automatically or specified explicitly by the user.

    This effectively means column-level conflict resolution does not work
    for `INSERT-INSERT` conflicts (even if the `INSERT` statements specify
    different subsets of columns, because the newer row will have all
    timestamps newer than the older one).

-   By treating the columns independently, it is easy to violate constraints
    in a way that would not be possible when all changes happen on the same
    node. Consider for example a table like this:

```sql
CREATE TABLE t (id INT PRIMARY KEY, a INT, b INT, CHECK (a > b));
INSERT INTO t VALUES (1, 1000, 1);
```

...and assume one node does:

```sql
UPDATE t SET a = 100;
```

...while another node does concurrently:

```sql
UPDATE t SET b = 500;
```

  Each of those updates is valid when executed on the initial row, and
  so will pass on each node. But when replicating to the other node,
  the resulting row violates the `CHECK (A > b)` constraint, and the
  replication will stop until the issue is resolved manually.

-   The column storing timestamp mapping is managed automatically. Do not
    specify or override the value in your queries, as it may result in
    unpredictable effects (we do ignore the value where possible anyway).

-   The timestamp mapping is maintained by triggers, but the order in which
    triggers execute does matter. So if you have custom triggers that modify
    tuples and are executed after the `pgl_clcd_` triggers, the modified
    columns will not be detected correctly.

-   When using regular timestamps to order changes/commits, it is possible
    that the conflicting changes have exactly the same timestamp (because
    two or more nodes happened to generate the same timestamp). This risk
    is not unique to column-level conflict resolution, as it may happen
    even for regular row-level conflict resolution, and we use node id as a
    tie-breaker in this situation (the higher node id wins), which ensures that
    same changes are applied on all nodes.

-   It is possible that there is a clock skew between different nodes. While it
    may induce somewhat unexpected behavior (discarding seemingly newer
    changes because the timestamps are inverted), clock skew between nodes can 
    be managed using the parameters `bdr.maximum_clock_skew` and 
    `bdr.maximum_clock_skew_action`.

-   The underlying pglogical subscription must not discard any changes,
    which could easily cause divergent errors (particularly for
    CRDT types). The subscriptions must have `ignore_redundant_updates`
    set to false (which is the default).

    Existing groups created with non-default value for `ignore_redundant_updates`
    can be altered like this:

```sql
SELECT bdr.alter_node_group_config('group', ignore_redundant_updates := false);
```
