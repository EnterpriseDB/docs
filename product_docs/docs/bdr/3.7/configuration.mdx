---

There are several PostgreSQL configuration parameters that affect BDR
nodes. Note that these parameters could be set differently on each node,
though that is not recommended, in general.

## PostgreSQL Settings for BDR

BDR requires these PostgreSQL settings to run correctly:

-   `wal_level` - Must be set to `logical`, since BDR relies upon logical decoding.
-   `shared_preload_libraries` - This must contain `pglogical,bdr` (in that order),
    though may also contain other entries before or afterwards, as needed.
-   `track_commit_timestamp` - Must be set to 'on' for conflict resolution to
    retrieve the timestamp for each conflicting row.

BDR requires these PostgreSQL settings to be set to appropriate values,
which vary according to the size and scale of the cluster.

-   `logical_decoding_work_mem` - memory buffer size used by logical decoding.
    Transactions larger than this will overflow the buffer and be stored
    temporarily on local disk. Default 64MB, but can be set much higher.

-   `max_worker_processes` - BDR uses background workers for replication
    and maintenance tasks, so there need to be enough worker slots for it to
    work correctly. The formula for the correct minimal number of workers is:
    one per PostgreSQL instance + one per database on that instance + four
    per BDR-enabled database + one per peer node in the BDR group + one for each
    writer enabled per peer node in the BDR group, for each database.
    Additional worker processes may be needed temporarily when node is being
    removed from a BDR group.

-   `max_wal_senders` - Two needed per every peer node.

-   `max_replication_slots` - Same as `max_wal_senders`.

-   `wal_sender_timeout` and `wal_receiver_timeout` - Determine how
    quickly an origin considers its CAMO partner as disconnected or
    reconnected; see [CAMO Failure Scenarios](camo#failure-scenarios) for
    details.

Note that in normal running for a group with N peer nodes, BDR will require
N slots/walsenders. During synchronization, BDR will temporarily use another
N - 1 slots/walsenders, so be careful to set the above parameters high enough
to cater for this occasional peak demand.

With parallel apply turned on, the number of slots needs to be increased to
N slots from above formula \* writers. This is because the `max_replication_slots`
also sets maximum number of replication origins and some of the functionality
of parallel apply uses extra origin per writer.

When WAL Decoder is enabled, the WAL decoder process will require one extra 
replication slot per BDR group.

The general safe recommended value on a 4 node BDR Group with a single database
is just to set `max_replication_slots` and `max_worker_processes` to something
like `50` and `max_wal_senders` to at least `10`.

Note also that changing these parameters requires restarting the local node:
`max_worker_processes`, `max_wal_senders`, `max_replication_slots`.

Applications may also wish to set these parameters. Please see chapter on
[Durability & Performance Options] for further discussion.

-   `synchronous_commit` - affects the durability and performance of BDR replication
    in a similar way to [physical replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-SYNCHRONOUS-COMMIT).
-   `synchronous_standby_names` - same as above

## 2ndQPostgres Settings for BDR

The following Postgres settings need to be considered for commit at
most once (CAMO), a feature that is only available for BDR in
combination with 2ndQPostgres.  Some of these are only available in
2ndQPostgres; others already exist in the community version, but only
become relevant with BDR in combination with CAMO.

-   `synchronous_replication_availability` - Can optionally be `async`
    for increased availability by allowing an origin to continue and
    commit after its CAMO partner got disconnected.  Under the default
    value of `wait`, the origin will wait indefinitely, and proceed to
    commit only after the CAMO partner reconnects and sends
    confirmation.
-   `snapshot_timestamp` - Turns on the usage of
    [timestamp-based snapshots](tssnapshots) and sets the timestamp to use.

## pglogical Settings for BDR

BDR is also affected by some of the pglogical settings as it uses 
pglogical internally to implement the basic replication.

-   `pglogical.track_subscription_apply` - Track apply statistics for 
    each subscription.
-   `pglogical.track_relation_apply` - Track apply statistics for each 
    relation.
-   `pglogical.track_apply_lock_timing` - Track lock timing when tracking
    statistics for relations.
-   `pglogical.standby_slot_names` - When using physical Standby nodes
    intended for failover purposes, should be set to the replication 
    slot(s) for each intended Standby.
-   `pglogical.writers_per_subscription` - Default number of writers per
    subscription (in BDR this can also be changed by
    `bdr.alter_node_group_config` for a group).
-   `pglogical.max_writers_per_subscription` - Maximum number of writers
    per subscription (sets upper limit for the setting above).

## BDR Specific Settings

There are also BDR specific configuration settings that can be set.
Unless noted otherwise, values may be set by any user at any time.

### Conflict Handling

-   `bdr.default_conflict_detection` - Sets the default conflict detection method
    for newly created tables; accepts same values as
    [bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection()](conflicts#bdralter_table_conflict_detection)

### Global Sequence Parameters

-   `bdr.default_sequence_kind` - Sets the default [sequence kind](sequences).

### DDL Handling

-   `bdr.default_replica_identity` - Sets the default value for `REPLICA IDENTITY`
    on newly created tables. The `REPLICA IDENTITY` defines which information is
    written to the write-ahead log to identify rows which are updated or deleted.

    The accepted values are:

    -   `DEFAULT` - records the old values of the columns of the primary key,
        if any (this is the default PostgreSQL behavior).
    -   `FULL` - records the old values of all columns in the row.
    -   `NOTHING` - records no information about the old row.

    See [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertable.html#SQL-CREATETABLE-REPLICA-IDENTITY)
    for more details.

    BDR can not replicate `UPDATE`s and `DELETE`s on tables without a `PRIMARY KEY`
    or `UNIQUE` constraint, unless the replica identity for the table is `FULL`,
    either by table-specific configuration or via `bdr.default_replica_identity`.

    If bdr.default_replica_identity is DEFAULT and there is a `UNIQUE`
    constraint on the table, it will not be automatically picked up as `REPLICA
    IDENTITY`.  It needs to be set explicitly at the time of creating the table,
    or afterwards as described in the documentation above.

    Setting the replica identity of table(s) to `FULL` increases the volume of
    WAL written and the amount of data replicated on the wire for the table.

-   `bdr.ddl_replication` - Automatically replicate DDL across nodes (default
    "on").

    This parameter can be only set by bdr_superuser or superuser roles.

    Running DDL or calling BDR administration functions with
    `bdr.ddl_replication = off` can create situations where replication stops
    until an administrator can intervene. See [the DDL replication chapter](ddl)
    for details.

    A `LOG`-level log message is emitted to the PostgreSQL server logs whenever
    `bdr.ddl_replication` is set to `off`. Additionally, a `WARNING-level`
    message is written whenever replication of captured DDL commands or BDR
    replication functions is skipped due to this setting.

-   `bdr.role_replication` - Automatically replicate ROLE commands across nodes
    (default "on"). This parameter is settable by a superuser only. This setting
    only works if `bdr.ddl_replication` is turned on as well.

    Turning this off without using external methods to ensure roles are in sync
    across all nodes may cause replicated DDL to interrupt replication until
    the administrator intervenes.

    See [Role manipulation statements in the DDL replication chapter](ddl#Role_manipulation_statements)
    for details.

-   `bdr.ddl_locking` - Configures the operation mode of global locking for DDL.

    This parameter can be only set by bdr_superuser or superuser roles.

    Possible options are:

    -   off - do not use global locking for DDL operations
    -   on - use global locking for all DDL operations
    -   dml - only use global locking for DDL operations that need to prevent
        writes by taking the global DML lock for a relation

    A `LOG`-level log message is emitted to the PostgreSQL server logs
    whenever `bdr.ddl_replication` is set to `off`. Additionally, a `WARNING`
    message is written whenever any global locking steps are skipped due to
    this setting. It is normal for some statements to result in two `WARNING`s,
    one for skipping the DML lock and one for skipping the DDL lock.

-   `bdr.truncate_locking` - False by default, this configuration option sets the 
    TRUNCATE command's locking behavior. Determines whether (when true) TRUNCATE
    obeys the bdr.ddl_locking setting.

### Global Locking

-   `bdr.ddl_locking` - Described above.
-   `bdr.global_lock_max_locks` - Maximum number of global locks that can be
    held on a node (default 1000). May only be set at Postgres server start.
-   `bdr.global_lock_timeout` - Sets the maximum allowed duration of any wait
    for a global lock (default 1 minute). A value of zero disables this timeout.
-   `bdr.global_lock_statement_timeout` - Sets the maximum allowed duration of
    any statement holding a global lock (default 10 minutes).
    A value of zero disables this timeout.
-   `bdr.global_lock_idle_timeout` - Sets the maximum allowed duration of
    idle time in transaction holding a global lock (default 10 minutes).
    A value of zero disables this timeout.

### Node Management

-   `bdr.replay_progress_frequency` - Interval for sending replication position
    info to the rest of the cluster (default 1 minute).

### Generic Replication

-   `bdr.xact_replication` - Replicate current transaction (default "on").

    Turning this off will make the whole transaction local only, which
    means the transaction will not be visible to logical decoding by
    BDR and all other downstream targets of logical decoding. Data will
    not be transferred to any other node, including logical standby nodes.

    This parameter can be only set by the bdr_superuser or superuser roles.

    This parameter can only be set inside the current transaction using the
    `SET LOCAL` command unless `bdr.permit_unsafe_commands = on`.

!!! Note
    Even with transaction replication disabled, WAL will be generated
    but those changes will be filtered away on the origin.

!!! Warning
    Turning off `bdr.xact_replication` *will* lead to data
    inconsistency between nodes, and should only be used to recover from
    data divergence between nodes or in
    replication situations where changes on single nodes are required for
    replication to continue. Use at your own risk.

-   `bdr.permit_unsafe_commands` - Option to override safety check on commands
    that are deemed unsafe for general use.

    Requires `bdr_superuser` or PostgreSQL superuser.

!!! Warning
    The commands that are normally not considered safe may either
    produce inconsistent results or break replication altogether. Use at your
    own risk.

-   `bdr.batch_inserts` - How many consecutive inserts to one table within
    a single transaction turns on batch processing of inserts for that table.

    This option allows replication of large data loads as COPY internally,
    rather than set of inserts. It also how the initial data during node join
    is copied.

-   `bdr.maximum_clock_skew`

    This specifies what should be considered as the maximum difference between
    the incoming transaction commit timestamp and the current time on the
    subscriber before triggering `bdr.maximum_clock_skew_action`.

    This checks if the timestamp of the currently replayed transaction is in the
    future compared to the current time on the subscriber; and if it is, and the
    difference is larger than `bdr.maximum_clock_skew`, it will do the action
    specified by the `bdr.maximum_clock_skew_action` setting.

    The default is -1, which means: ignore clock skew (the check is turned
    off). It is valid to set 0 as when the clock on all servers are synchronized,
    the fact that we are replaying the transaction means it has been committed in
    the past.

-   `bdr.maximum_clock_skew_action`

    This specifies the action to take if a clock skew higher than
    `bdr.maximum_clock_skew` is detected.

    There are two possible values for this option:

    -   `WARN` - Log a warning about this fact. The warnings are logged once per
        minute (the default) at the maximum to prevent flooding the server log.
    -   `WAIT` - Wait for as long as the current local timestamp is no longer older than
        remote commit timestamp minus the `bdr.maximum_clock_skew`.

### CRDTs

-   `bdr.crdt_raw_value` - Sets the output format of [CRDT Data Types](crdt).
    The default output (when this setting is `off`) is to return only the current
    value of the base CRDT type (for example, a bigint for `crdt_pncounter`).
    When set to `on`, the returned value represents the full representation of
    the CRDT value, which can for example include the state from multiple nodes.

### Max Prepared Transactions

-   `max_prepared_transactions` - Needs to be set high enough to cope
    with the maximum number of concurrent prepared transactions across
    the cluster due to explicit two-phase commits, CAMO or Eager
    transactions.  Exceeding the limit prevents a node from running a
    local two-phase commit or CAMO transaction, and will prevent all
    Eager transactions on the cluster.
    May only be set at Postgres server start.

### Eager Replication

-   `bdr.commit_scope` - Setting the commit scope to `global` enables
    [eager all node replication](eager) (default `local`).

-   `bdr.global_commit_timeout` - Timeout for both stages of a global
    two-phase commit (default 60s) as well as for CAMO-protected transactions
    in their commit phase, as a limit for how long to wait for the CAMO
    partner.

### Commit at Most Once

-   `bdr.enable_camo` - Used to enable and control the CAMO feature.
    Defaults to `off`.  CAMO can be switched on per transaction by
    setting this to `remote_write`, `remote_commit_async`, or
    `remote_commit_flush`.  For backwards-compatibility, the values
    `on`, `true`, and `1` set the safest `remote_commit_flush` mode.
    While `false` or `0` also disable CAMO.
-   `bdr.camo_partner_of` - Allows specifying a CAMO partner per database.
    Expects pairs of database name and node name joined by a colon.  Multiple
    pairs may be specified, but only the first occurrence per database
    is taken into account.  For example: `'db1:node_4 test_db:test_node_3'`.
    May only be set at Postgres server start.
-   `bdr.camo_origin_for` - Per-database node name of the origin of
    transactions in a CAMO pairing; for each database, this needs to match
    with the `bdr.camo_partner_of` setting on the corresponding origin node.
    May only be set at Postgres server start.
-   `bdr.standby_dsn` - Allows manual override of the connection
    string (DSN) to reach the CAMO partner, in case it has changed since
    the crash of the local node.  Should usually be unset.
    May only be set at Postgres server start.
-   `bdr.camo_local_mode_delay` - The commit delay that applies in
    CAMO's Local mode to emulate the overhead that normally occurs with
    the CAMO partner having to confirm transactions.  Defaults to 5 ms.
    Setting to 0 disables this feature.
-   `bdr.camo_enable_client_warnings` - Emit warnings if an activity is
    carried out in the database for which CAMO properties cannot be
    guaranteed. This is enabled by default. Well-informed users can choose
    to disable this to reduce the amount of warnings going into their logs.

### Timestamp-based Snapshots

-   `bdr.timestamp_snapshot_keep` - For how long to keep valid snapshots for the
    timestamp-based snapshot usage (default 0, meaning do not keep past snapshots).
    Also see `snapshot_timestamp` above.

### Monitoring and Logging

-   `bdr.debug_level` - Defines the log level that BDR uses to write
    its debug messages. The default value is `debug2`. If you want to see
    detailed BDR debug output, set `bdr.debug_level = 'log'`.

-   `bdr.trace_level` - Similar to the above, this defines the log level
    to use for BDR trace messages.  Enabling tracing on all nodes of a
    BDR cluster may help 2ndQuadrant Support to diagnose issues.
    May only be set at Postgres server start.

!!! Warning
    Setting `bdr.debug_level` or `bdr.trace_level` to a value >=
    `log_min_messages` can produce a very large volume of log output, so it should not
    be enabled long term in production unless plans are in place for log filtering,
    archival and rotation to prevent disk space exhaustion.

### Internals

-   `bdr.raft_keep_min_entries` - The minimum number of entries to keep in the
    Raft log when doing log compaction (default 100). The value of 0 will disable
    log compaction. **WARNING: If log compaction is disabled, the log will
    grow in size forever.** May only be set at Postgres server start.

-   `bdr.raft_response_timeout` - To account for network failures, the
    Raft consensus protocol implemented will time out requests after a
    certain amount of time.  This timeout defaults to 30 seconds.

-   `bdr.raft_log_min_apply_duration` - To move the state machine
    forward, Raft appends entries to its internal log.  During normal
    operation, appending takes only a few milliseconds.  This poses an
    upper threshold on the duration of that append action, above which
    an `INFO` message is logged.  This may indicate an
    actual problem. Default value of this parameter is 3000 ms.

-   `bdr.raft_log_min_message_duration` - When to log a consensus request.
     Measure round trip time of a bdr consensus request and log an
     `INFO` message if the time exceeds this parameter. Default value
     of this parameter is 5000 ms.

-   `bdr.backwards_compatibility` - Specifies the version to be
    backwards-compatible to, in the same numerical format as used by
    `bdr.bdr_version_num`, e.g. `30618`.  Enables exact behavior of a
    former BDR version, even if this has generally unwanted effects.
    Defaults to the current BDR version. Since this changes from release
    to release, we advise against explicit use within the configuration
    file unless the value is different to the current version.

-   `bdr.track_replication_estimates` - Track replication estimates in terms
    of apply rates and catchup intervals for peer nodes.  This information can
    be used by protocols like CAMO to estimate the readiness of a
    peer node. This parameter is enabled by default.

-   `bdr.lag_tracker_apply_rate_weight` - We monitor how far behind peer nodes
    are in terms of applying WAL from the local node, and calculate a moving
    average of the apply rates for the lag tracking. This parameter specifies
    how much contribution newer calculated values have in this moving average
    calculation. Default value is 0.1.
