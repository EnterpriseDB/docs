    BDR (Bi-Directional Replication) is a ground-breaking multi-master
    replication capability for PostgreSQL clusters that has been in full
    production status since 2014.

BDR (short for Bi-Directional Replication) is a PostgreSQL extension which
provides a solution for building multi-master clusters with mesh topology.
This means that you can write to any server and the changes will be
sent row-by-row to all the other servers that are part of the same BDR group.

BDR version 3 ("BDR3") is built on the [pglogical3](https://www.2ndquadrant.com/resources/pglogical/)
extension. However, everything you need to
know about BDR3 is included here and it is unnecessary, as well as potentially
confusing, to refer to pglogical docs.

This documentation refers only to BDR3, not to earlier architectures, referred
to as BDR1 and BDR2. There are significant and important differences in BDR3
and you should not refer to earlier docs or rely on anything stated within
them.

BDR3 supports different versions and variant of PostgreSQL, as shown below.

**BDR version support compatibility matrix:**

| BDR | Server                | Supported Versions |
| --- | --------------------- | ------------------ |
| 3.6 | PostgreSQL            | 10, 11             |
| 3.6 | EDB Postgres Extended | 11                 |
| 3.7 | PostgreSQL            | 11, 12, 13         |
| 3.7 | EDB Postgres Advanced | 11, 12, 13         |
| 3.7 | EDB Postgres Extended | 11, 12, 13         |

EDB Postgres Extended was formerly known as 2ndQ Postgres.

Some features are only available on particular versions of Postgres server.

-   Conflict-free Replicated Data Types - additional data types which provide
    mathematically proven consistency in asynchronous multi-master update
    scenarios
    (EDB Postgres Advanced, EDB Postgres Extended)
-   Column Level Conflict Resolution - ability to use per column last-update
    wins resolution so that UPDATEs on different fields can be "merged" without
    losing either of them
    (EDB Postgres Advanced, EDB Postgres Extended)
-   Transform Triggers - triggers that are executed on the incoming stream of
    data providing ability to modify it or to do advanced programmatic filtering
    (EDB Postgres Advanced, EDB Postgres Extended)
-   Conflict triggers - triggers which are called when conflict is detected,
    providing a way to use custom conflict resolution techniques
    (EDB Postgres Advanced, EDB Postgres Extended)
-   Additional DDL support (CREATE TABLE AS)
    (EDB Postgres Advanced, EDB Postgres Extended)
-   Advanced DDL Handling for NOT VALID constraints and ALTER TABLE
    (EDB Postgres Advanced, EDB Postgres Extended)
-   Additional synchronization for Logical/Physical Standby servers for faster
    build of failoverable standbys
    (EDB Postgres Advanced, EDB Postgres Extended)
-   Parallel Apply - allow multiple writers to apply the incoming changes
    (EDB Postgres Advanced, EDB Postgres Extended)
-   Eager Replication - synchronizes between the nodes of the cluster before
    committing a transaction to provide conflict free replication
    (EDB Postgres Extended)
-   Commit At Most Once - a consistency feature helping
    an application to commit each transaction only once, even in the
    presence of node failures
    (EDB Postgres Extended)
-   Timestamp-based Snapshots - providing consistent reads across multiple
    nodes for retrieving data as they appeared or will appear at a given time
    (EDB Postgres Extended)
-   Estimates for Replication Catch-up times
    (EDB Postgres Extended)
-   Hold back freezing to assist resolution of UPDATE/DELETE conflicts
    (EDB Postgres Extended)
-   Decoding Worker
    (EDB Postgres Extended 13 and above)

Features that are currently available only with EDB Postgres Extended are
expected to be available with EDB Postgres Advanced 14.
