An application may opt to use two-phase commit explicitly with BDR.  See
[Distributed Transaction Processing: The XA Specification](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009680699/toc.pdf).

The X/Open Distributed Transaction Processing (DTP) model envisages three
software components:

-   An application program (AP) that defines transaction boundaries and specifies
    actions that constitute a transaction.
-   Resource managers (RMs, such as databases or file access systems) that provide
    access to shared resources.
-   A separate component called a transaction manager (TM) that assigns identifiers
    to transactions, monitors their progress, and takes responsibility for
    transaction completion and for failure recovery.

BDR supports explicit external 2PC using the PREPARE TRANSACTION and
COMMIT PREPARED/ROLLBACK PREPARED commands. Externally, a BDR cluster
appears to be a single Resource Manager to the Transaction Manager for a
single session.

When `bdr.commit_scope` is `local`, the transaction is prepared only
on the local node. Once committed, changes will be replicated, and
BDR then applies post-commit conflict resolution.

Using `bdr.commit_scope` set to `local` may seem nonsensical with
explicit two-phase commit, but the option is offered to allow the user
to control the trade-off between transaction latency and robustness.

Explicit two-phase commit does not work in combination with either CAMO
or the global commit scope.  Future releases may enable this combination.

## Usage

Two-phase commits with a local commit scope work exactly like standard
PostgreSQL.  Please use the local commit scope and disable CAMO.

```sql
BEGIN;

SET LOCAL bdr.enable_camo = 'off';
SET LOCAL bdr.commit_scope = 'local';

... other commands possible...
```

To start the first phase of the commit, the client must assign a
global transaction id, which can be any unique string identifying the
transaction:

```sql
PREPARE TRANSACTION 'some-global-id';
```

After a successful first phase, all nodes have applied the changes and
are prepared for committing the transaction.  The client must then invoke
the second phase from the same node:

```sql
COMMIT PREPARED 'some-global-id';
```
