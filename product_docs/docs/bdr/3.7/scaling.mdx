AutoPartition provides automatic management of partitioned tables.

AutoPartition allows tables to grow easily to large sizes by automatic
partitioning management. This utilizes the additional features of BDR
such as low-conflict locking of creating and dropping partitions.

New partitions can be created regularly and then dropped when the
data retention period expires.

BDR management is primarily accomplished via SQL-callable functions.
All functions in BDR are exposed in the `bdr` schema. Unless you put it into
your `search_path`, you will need to schema-qualify the name of each function.

## Auto Creation of Partitions

`bdr.autopartition()` is used to create or alter the definition of automatic
range partitioning for a table. If no definition exists, it will be created,
otherwise later executions will alter the definition.

`bdr.autopartition()` does not lock the actual table, it only changes the 
definition of when and how new partition maintenance actions will take place.

`bdr.autopartition()` leverages the EDB Postgres Extended features to allow a
partition to be attached or detached/dropped without locking the rest of the
table, the feature to set a new tablespace while allowing SELECT queries.

An ERROR is raised if the table is not RANGE partitioned or a multi-column
partition key is used.

A new partition is added for every `partition_increment` range of values, with
lower and upper bound `partition_increment` apart. For tables with a partition
key of type `timestamp` or `date`, the `partition_increment` must be a valid
constant of type `interval`. For example, specifying `1 Day` will cause a new
partition to be added each day, with partition bounds that are 1 day apart.

If the partition column is connected to a `timeshard` or `ksuuid` sequence,
the `partition_increment` must be specified as type `interval`. Otherwise,
if the partition key is integer or numeric, then the `partition_increment`
must be a valid constant of the same datatype. For example, specifying
'1000000' will cause new partitions to be added every 1 million values.

If the table has no existing partition, then the specified
`partition_initial_lowerbound` is used as the lower bound for the first
partition. If `partition_initial_lowerbound` is not specified, then the system
tries to derive its value from the partition column type and the specified
`partition_increment`. For example, if `partition_increment` is specified as `1
Day`, then `partition_initial_lowerbound` will be automatically set to CURRENT
DATE. If `partition_increment` is specified as `1 Hour`, then
`partition_initial_lowerbound` will be set to the current hour of the current
date. The bounds for the subsequent partitions will be set using the
`partition_increment` value.

The system always tries to have a certain minimum number of advance partitions.
In order to decide whether to create new partitions or not, it uses the
specified `partition_autocreate_expression`. This can be a SQL evaluable
expression, which is evaluated every time a check is performed. For example,
for a partitioned table on column type `date`, if
`partition_autocreate_expression` is specified as `DATE_TRUNC('day',
CURRENT_DATE)`, `partition_increment`  is specified as `1 Day` and
`minimum_advance_partitions` is specified as 2, then new partitions will be
created until the upper bound of the last partition is less than
`DATE_TRUNC('day', CURRENT_DATE) + '2 Days'::interval`.

The expression is evaluated each time the system checks for new partitions.

For a partitioned table on column type `integer`, the
`partition_autocreate_expression` may be specified as `SELECT max(partcol) FROM
schema.partitioned_table`. The system then regularly checks if the maximum value of
the partitioned column is within the distance of `minimum_advance_partitions *
partition_increment`of the last partition's upper bound. It is expected that
the user creates an index on the `partcol` so that the query runs efficiently.
If the `partition_autocreate_expression` is not specified for a partition table
on column type `integer`, `smallint` or `bigint`, then the system will
automatically set it to `max(partcol)`.

If the `data_retention_period` is set, partitions will be automatically
dropped after this period. Partitions will be dropped at the same time as new
partitions are added, to minimize locking. If not set, partitions must
be dropped manually.

The `data_retention_period` parameter is only supported for timestamp (and
related) based partitions. The period is calculated by considering the upper
bound of the partition and the partition is either migrated to the secondary
tablespace or dropped if either of the given period expires, relative to the
upper bound.

By default, AutoPartition manages partitions globally. In other words, when a
partition is created on one node, the same partition is also created on all
other nodes in the cluster. So all partitions are consistent and guaranteed to
be available. For this, AutoPartition makes use of Raft. This behaviour can be
changed by passing `managed_locally` as `true`. In that case, all partitions
are managed locally on each node. This is useful for the case when the
partitioned table is not a replicated table and hence it may not be necessary
or even desirable to have all partitions on all nodes. For example, the
built-in `bdr.conflict_history` table is not a replicated table, and is
managed by AutoPartition locally. Each node creates partitions for this table
locally and drops them once they are old enough.

Tables once marked as `managed_locally` cannot be later changed to be managed
globally and vice versa.

Activities are performed only when the entry is marked `enabled = on`.

The user is not expected to manually create or drop partitions for tables
managed by AutoPartition. Doing so can make the AutoPartition metadata
inconsistent and could cause it to fail.

### Configure AutoPartition

The `bdr.autopartition` function configures automatic partinioning of a table.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.autopartition(relation regclass,
		partition_increment text,
		partition_initial_lowerbound text DEFAULT NULL,
		partition_autocreate_expression text DEFAULT NULL,
		minimum_advance_partitions integer DEFAULT 2,
		maximum_advance_partitions integer DEFAULT 5,
		data_retention_period interval DEFAULT NULL,
		managed_locally boolean DEFAULT false,
		enabled boolean DEFAULT on);
```

#### Parameters

-   `relation` - name or Oid of a table.
-   `partition_increment` - interval or increment to next partition creation.
-   `partition_initial_lowerbound` - if the table has no partition, then the
    first partition with this lower bound and `partition_increment` apart upper
    bound will be created.
-   `partition_autocreate_expression` - is used to detect if it is time to create new partitions.
-   `minimum_advance_partitions` - the system will attempt to always have at
    least `minimum_advance_partitions` partitions.
-   `maximum_advance_partitions` - number of partitions to be created in a single
    go once the number of advance partitions falls below `minimum_advance_partitions`.
-   `data_retention_period` - interval until older partitions are dropped, if
    defined. This must be greater than `migrate_after_period`.
-   `managed_locally` - if true then the partitions will be managed locally.
-   `enabled` - allows activity to be disabled/paused and later resumed/re-enabled.

#### Examples

Daily partitions, keep data for one month:

```sql
CREATE TABLE measurement (
logdate date not null,
peaktemp int,
unitsales int
) PARTITION BY RANGE (logdate);

bdr.autopartition('measurement', '1 day', data_retention_period := '30 days');
```

Create 5 advance partitions when there are only 2 more partitions remaining (each partition can hold 1 billion orders):

```sql
bdr.autopartition('Orders', '1000000000',
		partition_initial_lowerbound := '0',
		minimum_advance_partitions := 2,
		maximum_advance_partitions := 5
     );
```

### Create One AutoPartition

Use `bdr.autopartition_create_partition()` to create a standalone AutoPartition
on the parent table.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.autopartition_create_partition(relname regclass,
                          	   partname name,
                              	   lowerb text,
                                   upperb text,
                                   nodes oid[]);
```

#### Parameters

-   `relname` - Name or Oid of the parent table to attach to
-   `partname` - Name of the new AutoPartition
-   `lowerb` - The lower bound of the partition
-   `upperb` - The upper bound of the partition
-   `nodes` - List of nodes that the new partition resides on

### Stopping Auto-Creation of Partitions

Use `bdr.drop_autopartition()` to drop the auto-partitioning rule for the
given relation. All pending work items for the relation are deleted and no new
work items are created.

```sql
bdr.drop_autopartition(relation regclass);
```

#### Parameters

-   `relation` - name or Oid of a table

### Drop one AutoPartition

Use `bdr.autopartition_drop_partition` once a BDR AutoPartition table has been
made, as this function can specify single partitions to drop. If the partitioned
table has successfully been dropped, the function will return true.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.autopartition_drop_partition(relname regclass)
```

#### Parameters

-   `relname` - The name of the partitioned table to be dropped

### Notes

This will place a DDL lock on the parent table, before using DROP TABLE on the
chosen partition table.

### Wait for Partition Creation

Use `bdr.autopartition_wait_for_partitions()` to wait for the creation of
partitions on the local node. The function takes the partitioned table name and
a partition key column value and waits until the partition that holds that
value is created.

The function only waits for the partitions to be created locally. It does not guarantee
that the partitions also exists on the remote nodes.

In order to wait for the partition to be created on all BDR nodes, use the
`bdr.autopartition_wait_for_partitions_on_all_nodes()` function. This function
internally checks local as well as all remote nodes and waits until the
partition is created everywhere.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.autopartition_wait_for_partitions(relation regclass, text bound);
```

#### Parameters

-   `relation` - name or Oid of a table
-   `bound` - partition key column value.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.autopartition_wait_for_partitions_on_all_nodes(relation regclass, text bound);
```

#### Parameters

-   `relation` - name or Oid of a table.
-   `bound` - partition key column value.

### Find Partition

Use the `bdr.autopartition_find_partition()` function to find the partition for the
given partition key value. If partition to hold that value does not exist, then
the function returns NULL. Otherwise OID of the partition is returned.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.autopartition_find_partition(relname regclass, searchkey text);
```

#### Parameters

-   `relname` - name of the partitioned table.
-   `searchkey` - partition key value to search.

### Enable/Disable AutoPartitioning

Use `bdr.autopartition_enable()` to enable AutoPartitioning on the given table.
If AutoPartitioning is already enabled, then it will be a no-op. Similarly, use
`bdr.autopartition_disable()` to disable AutoPartitioning on the given table.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.autopartition_enable(relname regclass);
```

#### Parameters

-   `relname` - name of the relation to enable AutoPartitioning.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.autopartition_disable(relname regclass);
```

#### Parameters

-   `relname` - name of the relation to disable AutoPartitioning.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.autopartition_get_last_completed_workitem();
```

Return the `id` of the last workitem successfully completed on all nodes in the
cluster.

### Check AutoPartition Workers

From using the `bdr.autopartition_work_queue_check_status` function, you can
see the status of the background workers that are doing their job to maintain
AutoPartitions.

The workers can be seen through these views:
`autopartition_work_queue_local_status`
`autopartition_work_queue_global_status`

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.autopartition_work_queue_check_status(workid bigint
                           local boolean DEFAULT false);
```

#### Parameters

-   `workid` - The key of the AutoPartition worker
-   `local` - Check the local status only

#### Notes

AutoPartition workers are ALWAYS running in the background, even before the
bdr.autopartition function is called for the first time. If an invalid worker ID
is used, the function will return 'unknown'. 'In-progress' is the typical status.
