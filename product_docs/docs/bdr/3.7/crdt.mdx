Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDT) support merging values
from concurrently modified rows, instead of discarding one of the rows
(which is what traditional conflict resolution does).

Each CRDT type is implemented as a separate PostgreSQL data type, with
an extra callback added to the `bdr.crdt_handlers` catalog. The merge
process happens within pglogical on the apply side; no additional user
action is required.

CRDTs require the table to have column-level conflict resolution enabled
as documented in the [CLCD](column-level-conflicts) chapter.

The only action taken by the user is the use of a particular data type
in CREATE/ALTER TABLE, rather than standard built-in data types such as
integer; e.g. consider the following table with one regular integer
counter and a single row:

```
CREATE TABLE non_crdt_example (
    id      integer				PRIMARY KEY,
    counter integer				NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

INSERT INTO non_crdt_example (id) VALUES (1);
```

If we issue the following SQL on two nodes at same time:

```
UPDATE non_crdt_example
   SET counter = counter + 1    -- "reflexive" update
 WHERE id = 1;
```

... the resulting values can be seen using this query, after both
updates are applied:

```
SELECT * FROM non_crdt_example WHERE id = 1;
   id |   counter
 -----+-----------
    1 |         1
(1 row)
```

...showing that we've lost one of the increments, due to the update_if_newer
conflict resolver. If you use the CRDT counter data type instead,
you should observe something like this:

```
CREATE TABLE crdt_example (
    id      integer				PRIMARY KEY,
    counter bdr.crdt_gcounter	NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

ALTER TABLE crdt_example REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;

SELECT bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection('crdt_example',
			'column_modify_timestamp', 'cts');

INSERT INTO crdt_example (id) VALUES (1);
```

Again we issue the following SQL on two nodes at same time,
then wait for the changes to be applied:

```
UPDATE crdt_example
   SET counter = counter + 1    -- "reflexive" update
 WHERE id = 1;

SELECT id, counter FROM crdt_example WHERE id = 1;
   id |   counter
 -----+-----------
    1 |         2
(1 row)
```

This shows that CRDTs correctly allow accumulator columns to work, even
in the face of asynchronous concurrent updates that otherwise conflict.

The `crdt_gcounter` type is an example of state-based CRDT types, that
work only with reflexive UPDATE SQL, such as `x = x + 1`, as shown above.

The `bdr.crdt_raw_value` configuration option determines whether queries
return the current value or the full internal state of the CRDT type. By
default only the current numeric value is returned.  When set to `true`,
queries return representation of the full state - the special hash operator
(`#`) may be used to request only the current numeric value without using the
special operator (this is the default behavior). If the full state is
dumped using `bdr.crdt_raw_value = on` then the value would only be able
to be reloaed with `bdr.crdt_raw_value = on`.

Note: The `bdr.crdt_raw_value` applies only formatting of data returned
to clients; i.e. simple column references in the select list.  Any column
references in other parts of the query (e.g. `WHERE` clause or even
expressions in the select list) may still require use of the `#` operator.

Another class of CRDT data types exists, which we refer to as "delta CRDT"
types (and are a special subclass of operation-based CRDTs, as explained
later).

With delta CRDTs, any update to a value is automatically compared to the
previous value on the same node and then a change is applied as a delta
on all other nodes.

```
CREATE TABLE crdt_delta_example (
    id       integer            PRIMARY KEY,
    counter  bdr.crdt_delta_counter NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

ALTER TABLE crdt_delta_example REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;

SELECT bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection('crdt_delta_example',
			'column_modify_timestamp', 'cts');

INSERT INTO crdt_delta_example (id) VALUES (1);
```

If we issue the following SQL on two nodes at same time:

```
UPDATE crdt_delta_example
   SET counter = 2          -- notice NOT counter = counter + 2
 WHERE id = 1;
```

The resulting values can be seen using this query, after both updates
are applied:

```
SELECT id, counter FROM crdt_delta_example WHERE id = 1;
   id | counter
 -----+---------
    1 |       4
(1 row)
```

With a regular `integer` column the result would be `2`, of course. But
when we UPDATE the row with a delta CRDT counter, we start with the OLD
row version, make a NEW row version and send both to the remote node,
where we compare them with the version we find there (let's call that
the LOCAL version). Standard CRDTs merge the NEW and the LOCAL version,
while delta CRDTs compare the OLD and NEW versions and apply the delta
to the LOCAL version.

The CRDT types are installed as part of `bdr` into the `bdr` schema.
For convenience, the basic operators ( `+`, `#` and `!` ) and a number
of  common aggregate functions (`min`, `max`, `sum` and `avg`) are
created in `pg_catalog`, to make them available without having to tweak
`search_path`.

An important question is how query planning and optimization works with these
new data types. CRDT types are handled transparently - both `ANALYZE` and
the optimizer work, so estimation and query planning works fine, without
having to do anything else.

## State-based and operation-based CRDTs

Following the notation from [1], we do implement both operation-based
and state-based CRDTs.

### Operation-based CRDT Types (CmCRDT)

The implementation of operation-based types is quite trivial, because
the operation is not transferred explicitly but computed from the old
and new row received from the remote node.

Currently, we implement these operation-based CRDTs:

-   `crdt_delta_counter` - `bigint` counter (increments/decrements)
-   `crdt_delta_sum` - `numeric` sum (increments/decrements)

These types leverage existing data types (e.g. `crdt_delta_counter` is
a domain on a `bigint`), with a little bit of code to compute the delta.

This approach is possible only for types where we know how to compute
the delta, but the result is very simple and cheap (both in terms of
space and CPU), and has a couple of additional benefits (e.g. we can
leverage operators / syntax for the under-lying data type).

The main disadvantage is that it's not possible to reset this value reliably
in an asynchronous and concurrent environment.

Note: We could also implement more complicated operation-based types by
creating custom data types, storing the state and the last operation (we
decode and transfer every individual change, so we don't need multiple
operations). But at that point we lose the main benefits (simplicity,
reuse of existing data types) without gaining any advantage compared to
state-based types (still no capability to reset, ...), except for the
space requirements (we don't need a per-node state).

### State-based CRDT Types (CvCRDT)

State-based types require a more complex internal state, and so can't
use the regular data types directly the way operation-based types do.

Currently, we implement four state-based CRDTs:

-   `crdt_gcounter` - `bigint` counter (increment-only)
-   `crdt_gsum` - `numeric` sum/counter (increment-only)
-   `crdt_pncounter` - `bigint` counter (increments/decrements)
-   `crdt_pnsum` - `numeric` sum/counter (increments/decrements)

The internal state typically includes per-node information, increasing
the on-disk size but allowing additional benefits. The need to implement
custom data types implies more code (in/out functions and operators).

The advantage is the ability to reliably reset the values, a somewhat
self-healing nature in the presence of lost changes (which should not
happen in properly-operated cluster), and the ability to receive changes
from other than source nodes.

Consider for example that a value is modified on node A, and the change
gets replicated to B, but not C (due to network issue between A and C).
If B modifies the value, and this change gets replicated to C, it will
include even the original change from A. With operation-based CRDTs the
node C would not receive the change until the A-C network connection
starts working again.

The main disadvantages of CvCRDTs are higher costs, both in terms of
disk space - we need a bit of information for each node, including nodes
that have been already removed from the cluster). The complex nature of
the state (serialized into varlena types) means increased CPU usage.

## Disk-Space Requirements

An important consideration is the overhead associated with CRDT types,
particularly the on-disk size.

For operation-based types this is rather trivial, because the types
are merely domains on top of other types, and so have the same disk
space requirements (no matter how many nodes are there).

-   `crdt_delta_counter` - same as `bigint` (8 bytes)
-   `crdt_delta_sum` - same as `numeric` (variable, depending on precision
    and scale)

There is no dependency on the number of nodes, because operation-based
CRDT types do not store any per-node information.

For state-based types the situation is more complicated. All the types
are variable-length (stored essentially as a `bytea` column), and consist
of a header and a certain amount of per-node information for each node
that *modified* the value.

For the `bigint` variants, formulas computing approximate size are ( `N`
denotes the number of nodes that modified this value):

-   `crdt_gcounter` - `32B (header) + N * 12B (per-node)`
-   `crdt_pncounter` - `48B (header) + N * 20B (per-node)`

For the `numeric` variants there is no exact formula, because both the
header and per-node parts include `numeric` variable-length values. To
give you an idea of how many such values we need to keep:

-   `crdt_gsum`
    -   fixed: `20B (header) + N * 4B (per-node)`
    -   variable: `(2 + N)` `numeric` values
-   `crdt_pnsum`
    -   fixed: `20B (header) + N * 4B (per-node)`
    -   variable: `(4 + 2 * N)` `numeric` values

*Note*: It does not matter how many nodes are in the cluster, if the
values are never updated on multiple nodes. It also does not matter if
the updates were concurrent (causing a conflict) or not.

*Note*: It also does not matter how many of those nodes were already
removed from the cluster. There is no way to compact the state yet.

## CRDT Types vs Conflicts Handling

As tables may contain both CRDT and non-CRDT columns (in fact, most
columns are expected to be non-CRDT), we need to do both the regular
conflict resolution and CRDT merge.

The conflict resolution happens first, and is responsible for deciding
which tuple to keep (applytuple) and which one to discard. The merge
phase happens next, merging data for CRDT columns from the discarded
tuple into the applytuple.

*Note*: This makes CRDT types somewhat more expensive compared to plain
conflict resolution, because the merge needs to happen every time, even
when the conflict resolution can use one of the fast-paths (modified
in the current transaction, etc.).

## CRDT Types vs. Conflict Reporting

By default, detected conflicts are written into the server log. Without
CRDT types this makes perfect sense, because the conflict resolution
essentially throws away one half of the available information (local or
remote row, depending on configuration). This presents a data loss.

CRDT types allow both parts of the information to be combined
without throwing anything away, eliminating the data loss issue. This makes
the conflict reporting unnecessary.

For this reason, we skip the conflict reporting when the conflict can be
fully-resolved by CRDT merge, that is if each column meets at least one
of these two conditions:

1) the values in local and remote tuple are the same (NULL or equal)

2) it uses a CRDT data type (and so can be merged)

*Note*: This means we also skip the conflict reporting when there are no
CRDT columns, but all values in local/remote tuples are equal.

## Resetting CRDT Values

Resetting CRDT values is possible but requires special handling.
The asynchronous nature of the
cluster means that different nodes may see the reset operation (no
matter how it's implemented) at different places in the change stream.
Different nodes may also initiate a reset concurrently; i.e. before
observing the reset from the other node.

In other words, to make the reset operation behave correctly, it needs to
be commutative with respect to the regular operations. Many naive ways
to reset a value (which may work perfectly well on a single-node) fail
for exactly this reason.

For example, the simplest approach to resetting a value might be:

```
UPDATE crdt_table SET cnt = 0 WHERE id = 1;
```

With state-based CRDTs this does not work - it throws away the state for the
other nodes, but only locally. It will be added back by merge functions
on remote nodes, causing diverging values, and eventually receiving it
back due to changes on the other nodes.

With operation-based CRDTs, this may seem to work because the
update is interpreted as a subtraction of `-cnt`. But it only works in the
absence of concurrent resets. Once two nodes attempt to do a reset at
the same time, we'll end up applying the delta twice, getting a negative
value (which is not what we expected from a reset).

It might also seem that `DELETE + INSERT` can be used as a reset, but this
has a couple of weaknesses too. If the row is reinserted with the same
key, it's not guaranteed that all nodes will see it at the same position in
the stream of operations (with respect to changes from other nodes).
BDR specifically discourages re-using the same Primary Key value since
it can lead to data anomalies in concurrent cases.

State-based CRDT types can reliably handle resets,
using a special `!` operator like this:

```
UPDATE tab SET counter = !counter WHERE ...;
```

By "reliably" we mean the values do not have the two issues illustrated
above - multiple concurrent resets and divergence.

Operation-based CRDT types can only be reset reliably using
[Eager Replication](eager), since this avoids multiple concurrent resets.
Eager Replication can also be used to set either kind of CRDT to a specific
value.

## Implemented CRDT data types

Currently there are six CRDT data types implemented - grow-only counter
and sum, positive-negative counter and sum, and delta counter and sum.
The counters and sums behave mostly the same, except that the "counter" types
are integer-based (`bigint`), while the "sum" types are decimal-based
(`numeric`).

Additional CRDT types, described at [1], may be implemented later.

The currently implemented CRDT data types can be listed with the
following query:

```sql
SELECT n.nspname, t.typname
FROM bdr.crdt_handlers c
JOIN (pg_type t JOIN pg_namespace n ON t.typnamespace = n.oid)
  ON t.oid = c.crdt_type_id;
```

### grow-only counter (`crdt_gcounter`)

-   supports only increments with non-negative values ( `value + int`
    and `counter + bigint` operators)

-   current value of the counter can be obtained either using `#` operator
    or by casting it to `bigint`

-   is not compatible with simple assignments like `counter = value`
    (which is common pattern when the new value is computed somewhere in
    the application)

-   allows simple reset of the counter, using the `!` operator
    ( `counter = !counter` )

-   internal state can be inspected using `crdt_gcounter_to_text`

```
CREATE TABLE crdt_test (
    id       INT PRIMARY KEY,
    cnt      bdr.crdt_gcounter NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

INSERT INTO crdt_test VALUES (1, 0);      -- initialized to 0
INSERT INTO crdt_test VALUES (2, 129824); -- initialized to 129824
INSERT INTO crdt_test VALUES (3, -4531);  -- error: negative value

-- enable CLCD on the table
ALTER TABLE crdt_test REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
SELECT bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection('crdt_test', 'column_modify_timestamp', 'cts');

-- increment counters
UPDATE crdt_test SET cnt = cnt + 1 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE crdt_test SET cnt = cnt + 120 WHERE id = 2;

-- error: minus operator not defined
UPDATE crdt_test SET cnt = cnt - 1 WHERE id = 1;

-- error: increment has to be non-negative
UPDATE crdt_test SET cnt = cnt + (-1) WHERE id = 1;

-- reset counter
UPDATE crdt_test SET cnt = !cnt WHERE id = 1;

-- get current counter value
SELECT id, cnt::bigint, cnt FROM crdt_test;

-- show internal structure of counters
SELECT id, bdr.crdt_gcounter_to_text(cnt) FROM crdt_test;
```

    (which is the common pattern when the new value is computed somewhere in
    the application)

-   allows simple reset of the sum, using the `!` operator ( `sum = !sum` )

-   internal state can be inspected using `crdt_gsum_to_text`

-- increment sum
UPDATE crdt_test SET gsum = gsum + 11.5 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE crdt_test SET gsum = gsum + 120.33 WHERE id = 2;

-- error: minus operator not defined
UPDATE crdt_test SET gsum = gsum - 15.2 WHERE id = 1;

-- error: increment has to be non-negative
UPDATE crdt_test SET gsum = gsum + (-1.56) WHERE id = 1;

-- reset sum
UPDATE crdt_test SET gsum = !gsum WHERE id = 1;

-- get current sum value
