alphabetical order.

## User-Visible Catalogs and Views

### `bdr.conflict_history`

This table is the default table where conflicts are logged. The table is
RANGE partitioned on column `local_time` and is managed by Autopartition.
The default data retention period is 30 days.

Access to this table is possible by any table owner, who may see all
conflicts for the tables they own, restricted by row-level security.

For further details see [Logging Conflicts to a Table](conflicts).

### `bdr.camo_decision_journal`

A persistent journal of decisions resolved by a CAMO partner node
after a failover, in case `bdr.logical_transaction_status` got
invoked.  Unlike `bdr.node_pre_commit`, this does not cover
transactions processed under normal operational conditions (i.e. both
nodes of a CAMO pair are running and connected). Entries in this journal
are not ever cleaned up automatically.  This is a purely diagnostic
tool that the system does not depend on in any way.

payload is stored in a binary encoded format, which can be decoded
with the `bdr.decode_message_payload()` function; see the
[`bdr.global_consensus_journal_details`] view for more details.

### `bdr.global_lock`

This catalog table stores the information needed for recovering the

in `bdr.global_lock` do not necessarily reflect all global locking activity.

Do not modify the contents of this table: it is an important BDR catalog.

### `bdr.global_locks`

for more information about global locking.

#### `bdr.global_locks` Columns

| `global_lock_request_time` | timestamptz | Time this global lock acquire was initiated by origin node        |
| `local_lock_request_time`  | timestamptz | Time the local node started trying to acquire the local-lock      |
| `last_state_change_time`   | timestamptz | Time `acquire_stage` last changed                                 |

Column details:

-   `relation`: For DML locks, `relation` shows the relation on which the DML
    lock is acquired. For global advisory locks, `relation` column actually shows
    the two 32-bit integers or one 64-bit integer on which the lock is acquired.

-   `origin_node_id` and `origin_node_name`: If these are the same as the local
    node's ID and name, then the local node is the initiator of the global DDL
    lock, i.e. it is the node running the acquiring transaction. If these fields
    specify a different node, then the local node is instead trying to acquire its
    local DDL lock to satisfy a global DDL lock request from a remote node.

-   `pid`: The process ID of the process that requested the global DDL lock,
    if the local node is the requesting node. Null on other nodes; query the
    origin node to determine the locker pid.

-   `global_lock_request_time`: The timestamp at which the global-lock request
    initiator started the process of acquiring a global lock. May be null if
    unknown on the current node. This time is stamped at the very beginning
    of the DDL lock request, and includes the time taken for DDL epoch management
    and any required flushes of pending-replication queues. Currently only
    known on origin node.

-   `local_lock_request_time`: The timestamp at which the local node started
    trying to acquire the local lock for this global lock. This includes the
    time taken for the heavyweight session lock acquire, but does NOT include
    any time taken on DDL epochs or queue flushing. If the lock is re-acquired
    after local node restart, this will be the node restart time.

-   `last_state_change_time`: The timestamp at which the
    `bdr.global_locks.acquire_stage` field last changed for this global lock
    entry.

The records in this table will persist until the node(node_id) is a member of
the BDR cluster.

You may be more interested in the `bdr.node_slots` view for monitoring
purposes. See also [Monitoring](monitoring).

    as a workaround to use `replay_lag_bytes` or `replay_lag_size`.

### `bdr.replication_status`

This view shows incoming replication status between the local node and all other
nodes in the BDR cluster. If this is a logical standby node, then only
the status for its upstream node is shown. Similarly, replication
status is not shown for subscriber-only nodes since they never send
replication changes to other nodes.

An internal catalog table holding state per DDL epoch.

#### `bdr.ddl_epoch` Columns

| Name                  | Type        | Description                                                              |
| --------------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ddl_epoch             | int8        | Monotonically increasing epoch number                                    |
| origin_node_id        | oid         | Internal node id of the node that requested creation of this epoch       |
| epoch_consume_timeout | timestamptz | Timeout of this epoch                                                    |
| epoch_consumed        | boolean     | Switches to true as soon as the local node has fully processed the epoch |

### `bdr.internal_node_pre_commit`

Internal catalog table; please use the `bdr.node_pre_commit` view.

!!! Note
    This catalog is only present when bdr-enterprise extension is installed.

### `bdr.sequence_kind`

An internal state table storing the type of each non-local sequence.  The view
`bdr.sequences` is recommended for diagnostic purposes.

#### `bdr.sequence_kind` Columns

| Name    | Type | Description                                                 |
| ------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| seqid   | oid  | Internal OID of the sequence                                |
| seqkind | char | Internal sequence kind ('l'=local,'t'=timeshard,'g'=galloc) |

### `bdr.state_journal`

An internal node state journal.  Please use `bdr.state_journal_details` for
diagnostic purposes instead.

### `bdr.state_journal_details`

Every change of node state of each node is logged permanently in `bdr.state_journal`
for diagnostic purposes.
This view provides node names and human-readable state names and carries all of
the information in that journal.
Once a node has successfully joined, the last state entry will be
`BDR_PEER_STATE_ACTIVE`. This differs from the state of each replication connection
listed in `bdr.node_slots.state`.

#### `bdr.state_journal_details` Columns

| Name          | Type        | Description                                              |
| ------------- | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| state_counter | oid         | Monotonically increasing event counter, per node         |
| node_id       | oid         | Internal node id                                         |
| node_name     | name        | Name of the node                                         |
| state         | oid         | Internal state id                                        |
| state_name    | text        | Human-readable state name                                |
| entered_time  | timestamptz | Point in time the current node observed the state change |
