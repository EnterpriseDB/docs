BDR introduces new types of triggers which can be used for additional
data processing on the downstream/target node.

-   Conflict Triggers
-   Transform Triggers

Together, these types of triggers are known as Stream Triggers.

!!! Note
    This feature is currently only available on EDB Postgres Extended and
    EDB Postgres Advanced.

Stream Triggers are designed to be trigger-like in syntax, they leverage the
PostgreSQL BEFORE trigger architecture, and are likely to have similar
performance characteristics as PostgreSQL BEFORE Triggers.

One trigger function can be used by multiple trigger definitions, just as with
normal PostgreSQL triggers.
A trigger function is simply a program defined in this form:
`CREATE FUNCTION ... RETURNS TRIGGER`. Creating the actual trigger does not
require use of the CREATE TRIGGER command. Instead, stream triggers
are created using the special BDR functions
`bdr.create_conflict_trigger()` and `bdr.create_transform_trigger()`.

Once created, the trigger will be visible in the catalog table `pg_trigger`.
The stream triggers will be marked as `tgisinternal = true` and
`tgenabled = 'D'` and will have name suffix '\_bdrc' or '\_bdrt'. The view
`bdr.triggers` provides information on the triggers in relation to the table,
the name of the procedure that is being executed, the event that triggers it,
and the trigger type.

Note that stream triggers are NOT therefore enabled for normal SQL processing.
Because of this the `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE TRIGGER` is blocked for stream
triggers in both its specific name variant and the ALL variant, to prevent
the trigger from executing as a normal SQL trigger.

Note that these triggers execute on the downstream or target node. There is no
option for them to execute on the origin node, though one may wish to consider
the use of `row_filter` expressions on the origin.

Also, any DML which is applied during the execution of a stream
trigger will not be replicated to other BDR nodes, and will not
trigger the execution of standard local triggers. This is intentional,
and can be used for instance to log changes or conflicts captured by a
stream trigger into a table that is crash-safe and specific of that
node; a working example is provided at the end of this chapter.

## Trigger execution during Apply

Transform triggers execute first, once for each incoming change in the
triggering table. These triggers fire before we have even attempted to locate a
matching target row, allowing a very wide range of transforms to be applied
efficiently and consistently.

Next, for UPDATE and DELETE changes we locate the target row. If there is no 
target row, then there is no further processing for those change types.

We then execute any normal triggers that previously have been explicitly enabled
as replica triggers at table-level:

```sql
ALTER TABLE tablename
ENABLE REPLICA TRIGGER trigger_name;
```

We then decide whether a potential conflict exists and if so, we then call any
conflict trigger that exists for that table.

### Missing Column Conflict Resolution

Before transform triggers are executed, PostgreSQL tries to match the
incoming tuple against the rowtype of the target table.

Any column that exists on the input row but not on the target table
will trigger a conflict of type `target_column_missing`; conversely, a
column existing on the target table but not in the incoming row
triggers a `source_column_missing` conflict. The default resolutions
for those two conflict types are respectively `ignore_if_null` and
`use_default_value`.

This is relevant in the context of rolling schema upgrades; for
instance, if the new version of the schema introduces a new
column. When replicating from an old version of the schema to a new
one, the source column is missing, and the `use_default_value`
strategy is appropriate, as it populates the newly introduced column
with the default value.

However, when replicating from a node having the new schema version to
a node having the old one, the column is missing from the target
table, and the `ignore_if_null` resolver is not appropriate for a
rolling upgrade, because it will break replication as soon as the user
inserts, in any of the upgraded nodes, a tuple with a non-NULL value
in the new column.

In view of this example, the appropriate setting for rolling schema
upgrades is to configure each node to apply the `ignore` resolver in
case of a `target_column_missing` conflict.

This is done with the following query, that must be **executed
separately on each node**, after replacing `node1` with the actual
node name:

```sql
SELECT bdr.alter_node_set_conflict_resolver('node1',
    'target_column_missing', 'ignore');
```

#### Data Loss and Divergence Risk

In this section, we show how setting the conflict resolver to `ignore`
can lead to data loss and cluster divergence.

Consider the following example: table `t` exists on nodes 1 and 2, but
its column `col` only exists on node 1.

If the conflict resolver is set to `ignore`, then there can be rows on
node 1 where `c` is not null, e.g. `(pk=1, col=100)`. That row will be
replicated to node 2, and the value in column `c` will be discarded,
e.g. `(pk=1)`.

If column `c` is then added to the table on node 2, it will initially
be set to NULL on all existing rows, and the row considered above
becomes `(pk=1, col=NULL)`: the row having `pk=1` is no longer
identical on all nodes, and the cluster is therefore divergent.

Note that the default `ignore_if_null` resolver is not affected by
this risk, because any row that is replicated to node 2 will have
`col=NULL`.

Based on this example, we recommend running LiveCompare against the
whole cluster at the end of a rolling schema upgrade where the
`ignore` resolver was used, to make sure that any divergence is
detected and fixed.

## Terminology of row-types

This document uses these row-types:

-   `SOURCE_OLD` is the row before update, i.e. the key.
-   `SOURCE_NEW` is the new row coming from another node.
-   `TARGET` is row that exists on the node already, i.e. conflicting row.

## Conflict Triggers

Conflict triggers are executed when a conflict is detected by BDR, and
are used to decide what happens when the conflict has occurred.

-   If the trigger function returns a row, the action will be applied to the target.
-   If the trigger function returns NULL row, the action will be skipped.

To clarify, if the trigger is called for a `DELETE`, the trigger should
return NULL if it wants to skip the `DELETE`. If you wish the DELETE to proceed,
then return a row value - either `SOURCE_OLD` or `TARGET` will work.
When the conflicting operation is either `INSERT` or `UPDATE`, and the
chosen resolution is the deletion of the conflicting row, the trigger
must explicitly perform the deletion and return NULL.
The trigger function may perform other SQL actions as it chooses, but
those actions will only be applied locally, not replicated.

When a real data conflict occurs between two or more nodes, there will be
two or more concurrent changes occurring. When we apply those changes, the
conflict resolution occurs independently on each node. This means the conflict
resolution will occur once on each node, and can occur with a
significant time difference between then. As a result, there is no
possibility of communication between the multiple executions of the conflict
trigger. It is the responsibility of the author of the conflict trigger to
ensure that the trigger gives exactly the same result for all related events,
otherwise data divergence will occur. Technical Support recommends that all conflict
triggers are formally tested using the isolationtester tool supplied with
BDR.

!!! Warning
    -   Multiple conflict triggers can be specified on a single table, but
        they should match distinct event, i.e. each conflict should only
        match a single conflict trigger.  
    -   Multiple triggers matching the same event on the same table are
        not recommended; they might result in inconsistent behaviour, and
        will be forbidden in a future release.  

If the same conflict trigger matches more than one event, the `TG_OP`
variable can be used within the trigger to identify the operation that
produced the conflict.

By default, BDR detects conflicts by observing a change of replication origin
for a row, hence it is possible for a conflict trigger to be called even
when there is only one change occurring. Since in this case there is no
real conflict, we say that this conflict detection mechanism can generate
false positive conflicts. The conflict trigger must handle all of those
identically, as mentioned above.

Note that in some cases, timestamp conflict detection will not detect a
conflict at all. For example, in a concurrent UPDATE/DELETE where the
DELETE occurs just after the UPDATE, any nodes that see first the UPDATE
and then the DELETE will not see any conflict. If no conflict is seen,
the conflict trigger will never be called. The same situation, but using
row version conflict detection, *will* see a conflict, which can then be
handled by a conflict trigger.

The trigger function has access to additional state information as well as
the data row involved in the conflict, depending upon the operation type:

-   On `INSERT`, conflict triggers would be able to access `SOURCE_NEW` row from
    source and `TARGET` row
-   On `UPDATE`, conflict triggers would be able to access `SOURCE_OLD` and
    `SOURCE_NEW` row from source and `TARGET` row
-   On `DELETE`, conflict triggers would be able to access `SOURCE_OLD` row from
    source and `TARGET` row

The function `bdr.trigger_get_row()` can be used to retrieve `SOURCE_OLD`, `SOURCE_NEW`
or `TARGET` rows, if a value exists for that operation.

Changes to conflict triggers happen transactionally and are protected by
Global DML Locks during replication of the configuration change, similarly
to how some variants of `ALTER TABLE` are handled.

If primary keys are updated inside a conflict trigger, it can
sometimes leads to unique constraint violations error due to a difference
in timing of execution.
Hence, users should avoid updating primary keys within conflict triggers.

## Transform Triggers

These triggers are similar to the Conflict Triggers, except they are executed
for every row on the data stream against the specific table. The behaviour of
return values and the exposed variables are similar, but transform triggers
execute before a target row is identified, so there is no `TARGET` row.

Specify multiple Transform Triggers on each table in BDR, if desired.
Transform triggers execute in alphabetical order.

A transform trigger can filter away rows, and it can do additional operations
as needed. It can alter the values of any column, or set them to `NULL`. The
return value decides what further action is taken:

-   If the trigger function returns a row, it will be applied to the target.
-   If the trigger function returns a `NULL` row, there is no further action to be
    performed and as-yet unexecuted triggers will never execute.
-   The trigger function may perform other actions as it chooses.

The trigger function has access to additional state information as well as
rows involved in the conflict:

-   On `INSERT`, transform triggers would be able to access `SOURCE_NEW` row from source.
-   On `UPDATE`, transform triggers would be able to access `SOURCE_OLD` and `SOURCE_NEW` row from source.
-   On `DELETE`, transform triggers would be able to access `SOURCE_OLD` row from source.

The function `bdr.trigger_get_row()` can be used to retrieve `SOURCE_OLD` or `SOURCE_NEW`
rows; `TARGET` row is not available, since this type of trigger executes before such
a target row is identified, if any.

Transform Triggers look very similar to normal BEFORE row triggers, but have these
important differences:

-   Transform trigger gets called for every incoming change.
    BEFORE triggers will not be called at all for UPDATE and DELETE changes
    if we don't find a matching row in a table.

-   Transform triggers are called before partition table routing occurs.

-   Transform triggers have access to the lookup key via SOURCE_OLD,
    which is not available to normal SQL triggers.

## Stream Triggers Variables

Both Conflict Trigger and Transform Triggers have access to information about
rows and metadata via the predefined variables provided by trigger API and
additional information functions provided by BDR.

In PL/pgSQL, the following predefined variables exist:

### TG_NAME

Data type name; variable that contains the name of the trigger actually fired.
Note that the actual trigger name has a '\_bdrt' or '\_bdrc' suffix
(depending on trigger type) compared to the name provided during trigger creation.

### TG_WHEN

Data type text; this will say `BEFORE` for both Conflict and Transform triggers.
The stream trigger type can be obtained by calling the `bdr.trigger_get_type()`
information function (see below).

### TG_LEVEL

Data type text; a string of `ROW`.

### TG_OP

Data type text; a string of `INSERT`, `UPDATE` or `DELETE`
 telling for which operation the trigger was fired.

### TG_RELID

Data type oid; the object ID of the table that caused the trigger invocation.

### TG_TABLE_NAME

Data type name; the name of the table that caused the trigger invocation.

### TG_TABLE_SCHEMA

Data type name; the name of the schema of the table that caused the trigger
invocation. For partitioned tables, this is the name of the root table.

### TG_NARGS

Data type integer; the number of arguments given to the trigger function in
the `bdr.create_conflict_trigger()` or  `bdr.create_transform_trigger()`
statement.

### TG_ARGV\[]

Data type array of text; the arguments from the `bdr.create_conflict_trigger()`
or `bdr.create_transform_trigger()` statement. The index counts from 0.
Invalid indexes (less than 0 or greater than or equal to `TG_NARGS`) result in
a `NULL` value.

## Information functions

### bdr.trigger_get_row

This function returns the contents of a trigger row specified by an identifier
as a `RECORD`. This function returns NULL if called inappropriately, i.e.
called with SOURCE_NEW when the operation type (TG_OP) is DELETE.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.trigger_get_row(row_id text)
```

#### Parameters

-   `row_id` - identifier of the row; can be any of SOURCE_NEW, SOURCE_OLD and
    TARGET, depending on the trigger type and operation (see documentation of
    individual trigger types).

### bdr.trigger_get_committs

This function returns the commit timestamp of a trigger row specified by an
identifier. If not available because a row is frozen or row is not available,
this will return NULL. Always returns NULL for row identifier SOURCE_OLD.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.trigger_get_committs(row_id text)
```

#### Parameters

-   `row_id` - identifier of the row; can be any of SOURCE_NEW, SOURCE_OLD and
    TARGET, depending on trigger type and operation (see documentation of
    individual trigger types).

### bdr.trigger_get_xid

This function returns the local transaction id of a TARGET row specified by an
identifier. If not available because a row is frozen or row is not available,
this will return NULL. Always returns NULL for SOURCE_OLD and SOURCE_NEW row
identifiers.

This is only available for conflict triggers.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.trigger_get_xid(row_id text)
```

#### Parameters

-   `row_id` - identifier of the row; can be any of SOURCE_NEW, SOURCE_OLD and
    TARGET, depending on trigger type and operation (see documentation of
    individual trigger types).

### bdr.trigger_get_type

This function returns the current trigger type, which can be either `CONFLICT`
or `TRANSFORM`. Returns null if called outside a Stream Trigger.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.trigger_get_type()
```

### bdr.trigger_get_conflict_type

This function returns the current conflict type if called inside a conflict
trigger, or `NULL` otherwise.

See [Conflict Types]\(conflicts.md#List of Conflict Types)
for possible return values of this function.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.trigger_get_conflict_type()
```

### bdr.trigger_get_origin_node_id

This function returns the node id corresponding to the origin for the trigger
row_id passed in as argument. If the origin is not valid (which means the row
has originated locally), return the node id of the source or target node,
depending on the trigger row argument. Always returns NULL for row identifier
SOURCE_OLD. This can be used to define conflict triggers to always favour a
trusted source node. See the example given below.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.trigger_get_origin_node_id(row_id text)
```

#### Parameters

-   `row_id` - identifier of the row; can be any of SOURCE_NEW, SOURCE_OLD and
    TARGET, depending on trigger type and operation (see documentation of
    individual trigger types).

### bdr.ri_fkey_on_del_trigger

When called as a BEFORE trigger, this function will use FOREIGN KEY information
to avoid FK anomalies.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.ri_fkey_on_del_trigger()
```

## Row Contents

The SOURCE_NEW, SOURCE_OLD and TARGET contents depend on the operation, REPLICA
IDENTITY setting of a table, and the contents of the target table.

The TARGET row is only available in conflict triggers. The TARGET row only
contains data if a row was found when applying UPDATE or DELETE in the target
table; if the row is not found, the TARGET will be NULL.

## Triggers Notes

Execution order for triggers:

-   Transform triggers - execute once for each incoming row on the target
-   Normal triggers - execute once per row
-   Conflict triggers - execute once per row where a conflict exists

## Stream Triggers Manipulation Interfaces

Stream Triggers are managed using SQL interfaces provided as part of
bdr-enterprise extension.

Stream Triggers can only be created on tables with `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`
or tables without any `TOAST`able columns.

### bdr.create_conflict_trigger

This function creates a new conflict trigger.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.create_conflict_trigger(trigger_name text,
                            events text[],
                            relation regclass,
                            function regprocedure,
                            args text[] DEFAULT '{}')
```

#### Parameters

-   `trigger_name` - name of the new trigger
-   `events` - array of events on which to fire this trigger; valid values are
     '`INSERT`', '`UPDATE`' and '`DELETE`'
-   `relation` - for which relation to fire this trigger
-   `function` - which function to execute
-   `args` - optional; specifies the array of parameters the trigger function will
     receive upon execution (contents of `TG_ARGV` variable)

#### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This
means that the replication is affected by the
[ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering) configuration.

The function will take a global DML lock on the relation on which the trigger
is being created.

This function is transactional - the effects can be rolled back with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction, and the changes are visible to the current
transaction.

Similarly to normal PostgreSQL triggers, the `bdr.create_conflict_trigger`
function requires `TRIGGER` privilege on the `relation` and `EXECUTE`
privilege on the function. This applies with a
`bdr.backwards_compatibility` of 30619 or above. Additional
security rules apply in BDR to all triggers including conflict
triggers; see the [security chapter on triggers](security#triggers).

### bdr.create_transform_trigger

This function creates a new transform trigger.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.create_transform_trigger(trigger_name text,
                             events text[],
                             relation regclass,
                             function regprocedure,
                             args text[] DEFAULT '{}')
```

#### Parameters

-   `trigger_name` - name of the new trigger
-   `events` - array of events on which to fire this trigger, valid values are
     '`INSERT`', '`UPDATE`' and '`DELETE`'
-   `relation` - for which relation to fire this trigger
-   `function` - which function to execute
-   `args` - optional, specify array of parameters the trigger function will
     receive upon execution (contents of `TG_ARGV` variable)

#### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This
means that the replication is affected by the
[ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering) configuration.

The function will take a global DML lock on the relation on which the trigger
is being created.

This function is transactional - the effects can be rolled back with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction, and the changes are visible to the current
transaction.

Similarly to normal PostgreSQL triggers, the `bdr.create_transform_trigger`
function requires the `TRIGGER` privilege on the `relation` and `EXECUTE`
privilege on the function. Additional security rules apply in BDR to all
triggers including transform triggers; see the
[security chapter on triggers](security#triggers).

### bdr.drop_trigger

This function removes an existing stream trigger (both conflict and transform).

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.drop_trigger(trigger_name text,
                 relation regclass,
                 ifexists boolean DEFAULT false)
```

#### Parameters

-   `trigger_name` - name of an existing trigger
-   `relation` - which relation is the trigger defined for
-   `ifexists` - when set to true `true`, this command will ignore missing
     triggers

#### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This
means that the replication is affected by the
[ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering) configuration.

The function will take a global DML lock on the relation on which the trigger
is being created.

This function is transactional - the effects can be rolled back with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction, and the changes are visible to the current
transaction.

The `bdr.drop_trigger` function can be only executed by the owner of
the `relation`.

## Stream Triggers Examples

A conflict trigger which provides similar behaviour as the update_if_newer
conflict resolver:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_if_newer_trig_func
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    IF (bdr.trigger_get_committs('TARGET') >
        bdr.trigger_get_committs('SOURCE_NEW')) THEN
    RETURN TARGET;
    ELSIF
        RETURN SOURCE;
    END IF;
END;
$$;
```

A conflict trigger which applies a delta change on a counter column and uses
SOURCE_NEW for all other columns:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION delta_count_trg_func
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    DELTA bigint;
    SOURCE_OLD record;
    SOURCE_NEW record;
    TARGET record;
BEGIN
    SOURCE_OLD := bdr.trigger_get_row('SOURCE_OLD');
    SOURCE_NEW := bdr.trigger_get_row('SOURCE_NEW');
    TARGET := bdr.trigger_get_row('TARGET');

    DELTA := SOURCE_NEW.counter - SOURCE_OLD.counter;
    SOURCE_NEW.counter = TARGET.counter + DELTA;

    RETURN SOURCE_NEW;
END;
$$;
```

A transform trigger which logs all changes to a log table instead of applying them:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_change
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    SOURCE_NEW record;
    SOURCE_OLD record;
    COMMITTS timestamptz;
BEGIN
    SOURCE_NEW := bdr.trigger_get_row('SOURCE_NEW');
    SOURCE_OLD := bdr.trigger_get_row('SOURCE_OLD');
    COMMITTS := bdr.trigger_get_committs('SOURCE_NEW');

    IF (TG_OP = 'INSERT') THEN
        INSERT INTO log SELECT 'I', COMMITTS, row_to_json(SOURCE_NEW);
    ELSIF (TG_OP = 'UPDATE') THEN
        INSERT INTO log SELECT 'U', COMMITTS, row_to_json(SOURCE_NEW);
    ELSIF (TG_OP = 'DELETE') THEN
        INSERT INTO log SELECT 'D', COMMITTS, row_to_json(SOURCE_OLD);
    END IF;

    RETURN NULL; -- do not apply the change
END;
$$;
```

The example below shows a conflict trigger that implements Trusted Source
conflict detection, also known as trusted site, preferred node or Always Wins
resolution. This uses the bdr.trigger_get_origin_node_id() function to provide
a solution that works with 3 or more nodes.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION test_conflict_trigger()
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
	SOURCE	record;
	TARGET	record;

	TRUSTED_NODE	bigint;
	SOURCE_NODE		bigint;
	TARGET_NODE		bigint;
BEGIN
	TARGET := bdr.trigger_get_row('TARGET');
	IF (TG_OP = 'DELETE')
		SOURCE := bdr.trigger_get_row('SOURCE_OLD');
	ELSE
		SOURCE := bdr.trigger_get_row('SOURCE_NEW');
	END IF;

	TRUSTED_NODE := current_setting('customer.trusted_node_id');

	SOURCE_NODE := bdr.trigger_get_origin_node_id('SOURCE_NEW');
	TARGET_NODE := bdr.trigger_get_origin_node_id('TARGET');

	IF (TRUSTED_NODE = SOURCE_NODE) THEN
		RETURN SOURCE;
	ELSIF (TRUSTED_NODE = TARGET_NODE) THEN
		RETURN TARGET;
	ELSE
		RETURN NULL; -- do not apply the change
	END IF;
END;
$$;
```
