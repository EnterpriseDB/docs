The BDR3 extension can be created only by superusers, although if desired, it is possible to set up the `pgextwlist` extension and configure it to allow BDR3 to be created by a non-superuser.

Configuring and managing BDR3 does not require superuser access, nor is that recommended.
The privileges required by BDR3 are split across the following default/predefined roles, named
similarly to the PostgreSQL default/predefined roles:

-   *bdr_superuser* - the highest-privileged role, having access to all BDR tables and functions.
-   *bdr_read_all_stats* - the role having read-only access to the tables, views and functions, sufficient to understand the state of BDR.
-   *bdr_monitor* - at the moment the same as `bdr_read_all_stats`, to be extended later.
-   *bdr_application* - the minimal privileges required by applications running BDR.
-   *bdr_read_all_conflicts* - can view *all* conflicts in bdr.conflict_log.

These BDR roles are created when the BDR3 extension is
installed.  See [BDR Default Roles] below for more details.

Managing BDR does not require that administrators have access to user data.

Arrangements for securing conflicts are discussed here
[Logging Conflicts to a Table](conflicts).

Conflicts may be monitored using the BDR.conflict_history_summary view.

## Catalog Tables

System catalog and Information Schema tables are always excluded from replication by BDR.

In addition, tables owned by extensions are excluded from replication.

## BDR Functions & Operators

All BDR functions are exposed in the `bdr` schema. Any calls to these
functions should be schema qualified, rather than putting `bdr` in the
`search_path`.

All BDR operators are available via `pg_catalog` schema to allow users
to exclude the `public` schema from the search_path without problems.

## Granting privileges on catalog objects

Administrators should not grant explicit privileges on catalog
objects such as tables, views and functions; manage access to those objects
by granting one of the roles documented in [BDR
Default Roles].

This requirement is a consequence of the flexibility that allows
joining a node group even if the nodes on either side of the join do
not have the exact same version of BDR (and therefore of the BDR
catalog).

More precisely, if privileges on individual catalog objects have been
explicitly granted, then the `bdr.join_node_group()` procedure could
fail because the corresponding GRANT statements extracted from the
node being joined might not apply to the node that is joining.

## Role Management

Users are global objects in a PostgreSQL instance.
`CREATE USER` and `CREATE ROLE` commands are replicated automatically if they
are executed in the database where BDR is running and the
`bdr.role_replication` is turned on. However, if these commands are executed
in other databases in the same PostgreSQL instance then they will not be replicated,
even if those users have rights on the BDR database.

When a new BDR node joins the BDR group, existing users are not automatically
copied unless the node is added using `bdr_init_physical`. This is intentional
and is an important security feature. PostgreSQL allows users to access multiple
databases, with the default being to access any database. BDR does not know
which users access which database and so cannot safely decide
which users to copy across to the new node.

PostgreSQL allows you to dump all users with the command:

```postgresql
pg_dumpall --roles-only > roles.sql
```

The file `roles.sql` can then be edited to remove unwanted users before
re-executing that on the newly created node.
Other mechanisms are possible, depending on your identity and access
management solution (IAM), but are not automated at this time.

## Roles and Replication

DDL changes executed by a user are applied as that same user on each node.

DML changes to tables are replicated as the table-owning user on the target node.
It is recommended - but not enforced - that a table is owned by the same user on each node.

If table A is owned by user X on node1 and owned by user Y on node2, then if user Y
has higher privileges than user X, this could be viewed as a privilege escalation.
Since some nodes have different use cases, we allow this but warn against it
to allow the security administrator to plan and audit this situation.

On tables with row level security policies enabled, changes
will be replicated without re-enforcing policies on apply.
This is equivalent to the changes being applied as
`NO FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, even if
`FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY` is specified.
If this is not desirable, specify a row_filter that avoids
replicating all rows. It is recommended - but not enforced -
that the row security policies on all nodes be identical or
at least compatible.

Note that bdr_superuser controls replication for BDR and may
add/remove any table from any replication set. bdr_superuser
does not need, nor is it recommended to have, any privileges
over individual tables. If the need exists to restrict access
to replication set functions, restricted versions of these
functions can be implemented as `SECURITY DEFINER` functions
and `GRANT`ed to the appropriate users.

## Connection Role

When allocating a new BDR node, the user supplied in the DSN for the
`local_dsn` argument of `bdr.create_node` and the `join_target_dsn` of
`bdr.join_node_group` are used frequently to refer to, create, and
manage database objects. This is especially relevant during the
initial bootstrapping process, where the specified accounts may invoke
operations on database objects directly or through the pglogical
module rather than BDR.

BDR is carefully written to prevent privilege escalation attacks even
when using a role with `SUPERUSER` rights in these DSNs.

To further reduce the attack surface, a more restricted user may be
specified in the above DSNs.  At a minimum, such a user must be
granted permissions on all nodes, such that following stipulations are
satisfied:

-   the user has the `REPLICATION` attribute
-   it is granted the `CREATE` permission on the database
-   it inherits the `pglogical_superuser` and `bdr_superuser` roles
-   it owns all database objects to replicate, either directly or via
    permissions from the owner role(s).

Once all nodes are joined, the permissions may be further reduced to
just the following to still allow DML and DDL replication:

-   The user has the `REPLICATION` attribute.
-   It inherits the `pglogical_superuser` and `bdr_superuser` roles.

## Privilege Restrictions

BDR enforces additional restrictions, effectively preventing the
use of DDL that relies solely on TRIGGER or REFERENCES privileges.
The following sub-sections explain these.

`GRANT ALL` will still grant both TRIGGER and REFERENCES privileges,
so it is recommended that you state privileges explicitly, e.g.
`GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, TRUNCATE` instead of `ALL`.

### Foreign Key Privileges

`ALTER TABLE ... ADD FOREIGN KEY` is only supported if the user has
SELECT privilege on the referenced table, or if the referenced table
has RLS restrictions enabled which the current user cannot bypass.

Thus, the REFERENCES privilege is not sufficient to allow creation
of a Foreign Key with BDR. Relying solely on the REFERENCES privilege
is not typically useful since it makes the validation check execute
using triggers rather than a table scan, so is typically too expensive
to used successfully.

### Triggers

In PostgreSQL, triggers may be created by both the owner of a table and anyone who
has been granted the TRIGGER privilege. Triggers granted by the non-table owner
would execute as the table owner in BDR, which could cause a security issue.
The TRIGGER privilege is seldom used and PostgreSQL Core Team has said
"The separate TRIGGER permission is something we consider obsolescent."

BDR mitigates this problem by using stricter rules on who can create a trigger
on a table:

-   superuser
-   bdr_superuser
-   Owner of the table can create triggers according to same rules as in PostgreSQL
    (must have EXECUTE privilege on function used by the trigger).
-   Users who have TRIGGER privilege on the table can only create a trigger if
    they create the trigger using a function that is owned by the same owner as the
    table and they satisfy standard PostgreSQL rules (again must have EXECUTE
    privilege on the function). So if both table and function have same owner and the
    owner decided to give a user both TRIGGER privilege on the table and EXECUTE
    privilege on the function, it is assumed that it is okay for that user to create
    a trigger on that table using this function.
-   Users who have TRIGGER privilege on the table can create triggers using
    functions that are defined with the SECURITY DEFINER clause if they have EXECUTE
    privilege on them. This clause makes the function always execute in the context
    of the owner of the function itself both in standard PostgreSQL and BDR.

The above logic is built on the fact that in PostgreSQL, the owner of the trigger
is not the user who created it but the owner of the function used by that trigger.

The same rules apply to existing tables, and if the existing table has triggers which
are not owned by the owner of the table and do not use SECURITY DEFINER functions,
it will not be possible to add it to a replication set.

These checks were added with BDR 3.6.19.  An application that
relies on the behavior of previous versions can set
`bdr.backwards_compatibility` to 30618 (or lower) to behave like
earlier versions.

BDR replication apply uses the system-level default search_path only.
Replica triggers, stream triggers
and index expression functions may assume other search_path settings which will then fail when they
execute on apply. To ensure this does not occur, resolve object references clearly using either the default
search_path only (always use fully qualified references to objects, e.g. schema.objectname), or set the search
path for a function using ALTER FUNCTION ... SET search_path = ... for the functions affected.

## BDR Default/Predefined Roles

BDR predefined roles are created when the BDR3 extension is installed.
Note that after BDR3 extension is dropped from a database, the roles continue to exist
and need to be dropped manually if required. This allows BDR to be used in multiple
databases on the same PostgreSQL instance without problem.

Remember that the `GRANT ROLE` DDL statement does not participate in BDR replication,
thus you should execute this on each node of a cluster.

the table owner to successfully execute `bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind`.
These additional rules are documented with each specific function.

### bdr_read_all_conflicts

BDR logs conflicts into the bdr.conflict_log table. Conflicts are
visible to table owners (only), so no extra privileges are required
to read the conflict history. If it is useful to have a user that can
see conflicts for *all* tables, you may optionally grant the role
*bdr_read_all_conflicts* to that user.

## Verification

BDR has been verified using the following tools and approaches.

### Coverity

Coverity Scan has been used to verify the BDR stack providing coverage
against vulnerabilities using the following rules and coding standards:

-   MISRA C
-   ISO 26262
-   ISO/IEC TS 17961
-   OWASP Top 10
-   CERT C
-   CWE Top 25
-   AUTOSAR

### CIS Benchmark

CIS PostgreSQL Benchmark v1, 19 Dec 2019 has been used to verify the BDR stack.
Using the `cis_policy.yml` configuration available as an option with TPAexec
gives the following results for the Scored tests:
