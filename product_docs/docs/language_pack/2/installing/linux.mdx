## Installing with EDB Postgres Advanced Server

Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server on any Linux platform also installs language packs for Perl, Python, and TcL. See the [installation documentation](/epas/latest/installing/) for more information on accessing the EDB repository and installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server.  

## Installing with PostgreSQL

When using PostgreSQL, language packs are optional. By default they are not required, but they are necessary for some build options. For more information on language pack requirements, see [PostgreSQL requirements](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/install-requirements.html).
