Learn how to install, configure, and use the procedural languages (PL/Perl, PL/Python, and PL/Tcl).

Language pack installers install the PL/Perl, PL/Python, and PL/Tcl procedural languages that can be used with EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL. The language pack installers allow you to install Perl, Tcl/TK, and Python without installing supporting software from third-party vendors.

The Language Pack 4.1 installer includes:

-   Tcl with TK version 8.6.13
-   Perl version 5.38.2
-   Python version 3.11.7

Language Pack 4.1 contains the `cpan` package manager, and Python contains `pip` and `easy_install` package managers. There is no package manager for Tcl/TK.

In previous Postgres releases, `plpython` was statically linked with ActiveState's python library. The Language Pack Installer dynamically links with our shared object for python. In ActiveState Linux installers for Python, there is no dynamic library. As a result of these changes, `plpython` no longer works with ActiveState installers.

!!! Note
    The term *Postgres* refers to either PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server.
