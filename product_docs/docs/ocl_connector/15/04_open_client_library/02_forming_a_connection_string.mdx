The EDB OCL Connector accepts both Oracle-style and Postgres-style connection URIs. A connection string can take the following Oracle-style form:

 `[//][host][:port][/dbname]`

Or it can take the following Postgres-style forms:

```text
postgres://[user[:password]@][host][:port][/dbname]
[?param1=value1&...]
```

```text
postgresql://[user[:password]@][host][:port][/dbname]
[?param1=value1&...]
```

You can also use a Postgres-style URI to specify multiple host components (each with an optional port component) in a single URI. A multi-host connection string takes the form:

 `postgresql://<user>:<password>@host1:port1,host2:port2,host3:port3/`

Where:

 `user` is the name of the connecting user.

 `password` is the password associated with the connecting user.

 `host` is the host name or IP address to which you are connecting. To specify an IPV6 address, enclose the address in square brackets.

 `port` is the port number to which you are connecting.

 `dbname` is the name of the database with which you are connecting.

 `paramx=valuex` pairs specify extra (application-specific) connection properties.

For example, each of the following connection strings establishes a connection to the `edb` database on port `5444` of a system with an IP address of `10.0.0.4`:

 `//10.0.0.4:5444/edb`  
 `postgres://<user>:<password>@10.0.0.4:5444/edb`  
 `postgresql://<user>:<password>@10.0.0.4:5444/edb`

For more information about using Postgres-style connection strings, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/).
