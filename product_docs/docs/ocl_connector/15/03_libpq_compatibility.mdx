EDB OCL installation always uses the latest libpq. The different scenarios supported under libpq cross-version compatibility are as following when upgrading to a new major release of EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS):

-   If the latest libpq is installed on the machine, OCL uses it.
-   If the latest libpq isn't already installed, OCL installs it. It doesn't use the existing libpq of older versions even if it's installed.
-   If you upgrade the OCL version, then libpq is also upgraded to its latest version.

If you are upgrading to a minor release, you need to manually upgrade libpq. See the following section for instructions.

## Upgrading libpq for minor releases of EPAS

For minor releases of EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you may need to upgrade libpq to a required version on the client machine where you installed EDB OCL Connector. (Any new libpq version dependencies are listed in the release notes.) If you need to upgrade libpq, run the appropriate command for your operating system.

### For Ubuntu/Debian

```
sudo apt-get install edb-as15-libpq5
```

### For RHEL and SLES 

```
sudo <package-manager> install edb-as15-server-libs
```

Where `<package-manager>` is the package manager used with your operating system:

| Package manager |         Operating system         |
| --------------- | -------------------------------- |
| dnf             | RHEL 8/9 and derivatives         |
| yum             | RHEL 7 and derivatives, CentOS 7 |
| zypper          | SLES                             |
