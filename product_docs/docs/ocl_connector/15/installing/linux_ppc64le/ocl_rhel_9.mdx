## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install Postgres on a host that the product can connect to using a connection string. It doesn't need to be on the same host. See:

  - [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/installing/)

  - [Installing PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

- Set up the EDB repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

  To determine if your repository exists, enter this command:

  `dnf repolist | grep enterprisedb`

  If no output is generated, the repository isn't installed.

  To set up the EDB repository:

  1. Go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).

  1. Select the button that provides access to the EDB repo.

  1. Select the platform and software that you want to download.

- Install the EPEL repository
  ```shell
  sudo dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm
  ```
- Refresh the cache
  ```shell
  sudo dnf makecache
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-oci
sudo dnf -y install edb-oci-devel
```
