title: "Generating the OCL trace"

<div id="generating_the_ocl_trace" class="registered_link"></div>

The OCL tracing option logs direct communication (queries, updates, etc.) with the backend in the specified `OCI_DEBUG_LOG file`. It also logs the functions/APIs that were invoked. The trace files are generated in the default working directory (`oci_log_file_name`). If you append the path with a file name (`directory path/oci_log_file_name`), then the trace files are generated at specific location.

A trace file is generated for each connection in text-file (readable) format.

!!! Note
    OCL tracing is disabled by default.

To generate the OCL trace:

1.  Enable the EDB client-side tracing for OCL. You can enable the OCL tracing by setting these environment variables:

`export OCI_DEBUG_LEVEL=4`

`export OCI_DEBUG_LOG=oci_log_file`

2.  After you export the environment variables, run the application. The OCL trace files are generated in the specified directory.
