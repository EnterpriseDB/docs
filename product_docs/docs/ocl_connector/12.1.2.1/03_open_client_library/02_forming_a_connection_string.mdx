The OCL connector accepts both Oracle-style and Postgres-style connection URI's. A connection string may take the following Oracle-style form:

> `[//][host][:port][/dbname]`

or the following Postgres-style forms:

``` text
postgres://[user[:password]@][host][:port][/dbname]
[?param1=value1&...]
```

``` text
postgresql://[user[:password]@][host][:port][/dbname]
[?param1=value1&...]
```

You can also use a Postgres-style URI to specify multiple host components (each with an optional port component) in a single URI. A multi-host connection string takes the form:

> `postgresql://host1:port1,host2:port2,host3:port3/`

Where:

> `user` is the name of the connecting user.
> 
> `password` is the password associated with the connecting user.
> 
> `host` is the host name or IP address to which you are connecting; to specify an IPV6 address, enclose the address in square brackets.
> 
> `port` is the port number to which you are connecting.
> 
> `dbname` is the name of the database with which you are connecting.
> 
> `paramx=valuex` pairs specify extra (application-specific) connection properties.

For example, each of the following connection strings establish a connection to the `edb` database on port `5444` of a system with an IP address of `10.0.0.4`:

> `//10.0.0.4:5444/edb`  
> `postgres://10.0.0.4:5444/edb`  
> `postgresql://10.0.0.4:5444/edb`

For more information about using Postgres-style connection strings, please see the PostgreSQL core documentation, available [here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/product-documentation).
