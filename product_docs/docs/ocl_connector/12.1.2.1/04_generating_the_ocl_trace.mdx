The OCL tracing option logs direct communication (queries, updates, etc.) with the backend in specified `OCI_DEBUG_LOG file`. In addition, it also logs the functions/APIs that were invoked. The trace files are generated in the default working directory (`oci_log_file_name`). If you append the path with a file name (`directory path/oci_log_file_name`), then the trace files are generated at specific location.

A tracefile is generated for each connection in text file (readable) format.
