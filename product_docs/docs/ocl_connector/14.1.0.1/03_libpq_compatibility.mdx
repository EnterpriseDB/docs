EDB OCL installation always uses the latest libpq. The different scenarios supported under libpq cross-version compatibility are as following:

-   If the latest libpq is installed on the machine, OCL uses it.
-   If the latest libpq is not already installed, OCL installs it. It does not use the existing libpq of older versions even if it is installed.
-   If you upgrade the OCL version, then libpq is also upgraded to its latest version.
