There are two steps to completing an installation:

- [Setting up the repository](#setting-up-the-repository)
- [Installing the package](#installing-the-package)

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

Before setting up the repository, you need to register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

## Setting up the repository

Setting up the repository is a one time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform these steps.

```shell
# Install the repository configuration and enter your EDB repository 
# credentials when prompted
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to 
# SUSE repositories
zypper install SUSEConnect

# Register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
# Replace 'REGISTRATION_CODE' and 'EMAIL' with your SUSE registration 
# information
SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'

# Activate the required SUSE modules 
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/ppc64le
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/ppc64le

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh
```

## Installing the package

```shell
zypper -n install edb-oci
```
