Before installing the OCL Connector, you must install the following prerequisite packages, and request credentials from EDB:

- Install the `epel-release` package:

```text
yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
```

- The EPEL packages may depend on packages from other repositories. To download the packages, enable the platform-specific repositories:

  - For RHEL 7

    Enable the optional, extras, and HA repositories:

    ```text
    subscription-manager repos --enable "rhel-*-optional-rpms" --enable "rhel-*-extras-rpms"  --enable "rhel-ha-for-rhel-*-server-rpms"
    ```
  - For CentOS 7
      
    You may need to enable the `[extras]` repository definition in the `CentOS-Base.repo` file (located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`).

You must also have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

 <https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf>

After receiving your repository credentials you can:

1.  Create the repository configuration file.
2.  Modify the file, providing your user name and password.
3.  Install `edb-oci`.

**Creating a repository configuration file**

To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges, and invoke the following command:

 ```text
 yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
 ```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

**Modifying the file, providing your user name and password**

After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to ensure that the value of the `enabled` parameter is `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EDB user.

```text
[edb]
name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```

**Installing OCL Connector**

After saving your changes to the configuration file, use the following commands to install the OCL Connector:

```
yum install edb-oci

yum install edb-oci-devel
```

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.
