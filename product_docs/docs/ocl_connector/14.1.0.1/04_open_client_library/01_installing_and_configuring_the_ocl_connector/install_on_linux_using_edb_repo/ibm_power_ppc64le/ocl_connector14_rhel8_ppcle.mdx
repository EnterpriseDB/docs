## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on a host that the product can connect to using a connection string. It doesn't need to be on the same host. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux).

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Address other prerequisites

  ```shell
  # Install the EPEL repository:
  sudo dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

  # Refresh the cache:
  sudo dnf makecache
  #  Enable additional repositories to resolve dependencies:
  ARCH=$( /bin/arch ) subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"

  #  Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:
  sudo dnf -qy module disable postgresql

  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-oci
```
