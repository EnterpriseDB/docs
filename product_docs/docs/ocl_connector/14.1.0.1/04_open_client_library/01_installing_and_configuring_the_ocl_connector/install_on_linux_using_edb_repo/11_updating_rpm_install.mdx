title: "Updating an RPM installation"
---

If you have an existing `OCL Connector` RPM installation, you can use yum or dnf to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the `edb.repo` file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

     `yum upgrade edb-repo`

-   On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8:

     `dnf upgrade edb-repo`

yum or dnf will update the `edb.repo` file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your `edb.repo` file. Then, you can use yum to upgrade any installed packages:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

     `yum upgrade edb-oci`

     `yum upgrade edb-oci-devel`

-   On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8:

     `dnf upgrade edb-oci`

     `dnf upgrade edb-oci-devel`
