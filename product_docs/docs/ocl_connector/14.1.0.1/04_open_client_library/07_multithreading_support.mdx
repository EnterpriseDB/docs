OCL is supported in a multithreaded environment. You can enable and use multithreading in a multithreaded environment by making an `OCIEnvNlsCreate()` call with `OCI_THREADED` as the value of the mode parameter.

```text
retCode = OCIEnvNlsCreate( &envp,
                           OCI_THREADED,
                           NULL,
                           NULL,
                           NULL,
                           NULL,
                           0,
                           NULL,
                           0,
                           0 );
```

All subsequent calls to `OCIEnvNlsCreate()` must also be made with `OCI_THREADED`.

OCI library manages mutexes for the application for each environment handle if a multithreaded application is running on a thread-safe operating system.
