The EDB Open Client Library allows applications written using the Oracle Call Interface API to connect to and access an EDB database with minimal changes to the C source code. The EDB Open Client Library files are named:

 On Linux:

 `libedboci.so`

 On Windows:

 `edboci.dll`

The files are installed in the `oci/lib` subdirectory.

**Compiling and Linking a Sample Program**

The following example compiles and links the sample program `edb_demo.c` in a Linux environment. The `edb_demo.c` is located in the `oci/samples` subdirectory.

1.  Set the `ORACLE_HOME` and `EDB_HOME` environment variables.

2.  Set `ORACLE_HOME` to the complete pathname of the Oracle home directory.

For example:

`export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server`

3.  Set `EDB_HOME` to the complete pathname of the home directory.

For example:

`export EDB_HOME=/usr/edb`

4.  Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to the complete path of `libpthread.so`. By default, `libpthread.so` is located in `/lib64`.

`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib64/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

5.  Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include the Advanced Server Open Client library. By default, `libiconv.so.2` is located in `$EDB_HOME/oci/lib`.

`export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$EDB_HOME/oci:$EDB_HOME/oci/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`

6.  Then, compile and link the OCL API program.

`cd $EDB_HOME/oci/samples`

`make`
