EDB Postgres Advanced Server provides native support for using SSL connections to encrypt client/server communications for increased security. In OCL, it is controlled by setting the `sslmode` parameter to `verify-full` or `verify-ca`, and providing the system with a root certificate to verify against.

**Steps of SSL configuration:**

1.  Configure the Server and Client Side Certificates; for detailed information about configuring SSL client and server side certificates, refer to the PostgreSQL SSL [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/libpq-ssl.html).

2.  Enable the SSL OCL Connection:

    In an OCL client application, you can enable SSL mode by setting the `EDB_ATTR_SSL` attribute in `Session`.

```text
char*sslmode= "verify-full";
retValue=OCIAttrSet((dvoid*)authp,(ub4)OCI_HTYPE_SESSION,
           (dvoid*)sslmode,(ub4)strlen((char*)sslmode),
       (ub4)EDB_ATTR_SSL, errhp);
```

!!! Note
    `EDB_ATTR_SSL` is defined in `edboci.h` header file available in installation directory.

3.  After setting SSL attribute, you can use the `OCILogon` function to create a connection:

```text
OCILogon(pEnv,pError,&pSvc,(OraText*)pUsername,ub4)UsernameLen,
        (OraText*)pPassword,(ub4)PasswordLen,
        (OraText*)pDatabase,(ub4)DatabaseLen);
```

Once the server is authenticated, then the client is ready to pass sensitive data.
