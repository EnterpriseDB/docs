EDB Postgres Advanced Server provides native support for using SSL connections to encrypt client/server communications for increased security. In OCL, it's controlled by setting the `sslmode` parameter to `verify-full` or `verify-ca` and providing the system with a root certificate to verify against.

## Steps of SSL configuration

1.  Configure the server and client-side certificates. For detailed information about configuring SSL client and server-side certificates, refer to the [PostgreSQL SSL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/libpq-ssl.html).

2.  Enable the SSL OCL connection:

    In an OCL client application, you can enable SSL mode by setting the `EDB_ATTR_SSL` attribute in `Session`.

```c
char* sslmode = "verify-full";
retValue = OCIAttrSet((dvoid*)authp,
                      (ub4)OCI_HTYPE_SESSION,
                      (dvoid*)sslmode,
                      (ub4)strlen((char*)sslmode),
                      (ub4)EDB_ATTR_SSL,
                      errhp);
```

!!! Note
    `EDB_ATTR_SSL` is defined in the `edboci.h` header file available in the installation directory.

3.  After setting SSL attribute, you can use the `OCILogon` function to create a connection:

```c
OCILogon(pEnv,pError,&pSvc,(OraText*)pUsername,ub4)UsernameLen,
        (OraText*)pPassword,(ub4)PasswordLen,
        (OraText*)pDatabase,(ub4)DatabaseLen);
```

Once the server is authenticated, then the client is ready to pass sensitive data.

For more information about the supported SSL mode options, see the [PostgreSQL SSL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/libpq-ssl.html#LIBPQ-SSL-SSLMODE-STATEMENTS).
