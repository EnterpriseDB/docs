The EDB OCL Connector provides an API similar to the Oracle Call Interface. You can use EDB's OCL Connector to compile applications that are written to use the Oracle Call Interface to interact with an EDB Postgres Advanced Server database server.

!!! Note
    EDB doesn't support the use of the Open Client Library with Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) and Oracle Exadata. These Oracle products aren't evaluated or certified with this EDB product.
