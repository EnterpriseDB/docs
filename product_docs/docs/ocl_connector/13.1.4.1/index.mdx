title: "EDB OCL Connector Guide"
---



The EDB OCL Connector provides an API similar to the Oracle Call Interface. Applications that are written to use the Oracle Call Interface may be recompiled using EDB's OCL connector in order to interact with an Advanced Server database server.

This guide provides installation and usage instructions about:

-   How to install the connector.
-   How to form an Oracle style connection string.
-   How to compile and link a program.

This guide also includes a reference section for the functions supported by Advanced Server.
