The EDB Open Client Library allows applications written using the Oracle Call Interface API to connect to and access an EDB database with minimal changes to the C source code. The EDB Open Client Library files are named:

> On Linux:
>
> `libedboci.so`
>
> On Windows:
>
> `edboci.dll`

The files are installed in the `oci/lib` subdirectory.

**Compiling and Linking a Sample Program**

The following example compiles and links the sample program `edb_demo.c` in a Linux environment. The `edb_demo.c` is located in the `oci/samples` subdirectory.

1.  Set the `ORACLE_HOME` and `EDB_HOME` environment variables.

<!-- -->

1.  Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to the complete path of `libpthread.so`. By default, `libpthread.so` is located in `/lib64`.

<!-- -->

1.  Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include the Advanced Server Open Client library. By default, `libiconv.so.2` is located in `$EDB_HOME/oci/lib`.

<!-- -->

1.  Then, compile and link the OCL API program.
