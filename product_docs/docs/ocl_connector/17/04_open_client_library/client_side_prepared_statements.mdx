title: "Client side prepared statement"
---

OCL now supports client-side prepared statements, a feature specific to `SELECT` queries. When enabled, `SELECT` statements are executed as simple queries and retrieve all data in a single round trip from the server. This improves performance, especially for queries that use parallel workers. By default, this feature is disabled.

To enable client-side prepared statements, set the `ClientSidePrepared` environment variable:

**On Windows:**

```
set ClientSidePrepared=1
```

**On Linux:**

```
export ClientSidePrepared=1
```
