The EDB Open Client Library allows applications written using the Oracle Call Interface API to connect to and access an EDB database with minimal changes to the C source code. The EDB Open Client Library files are named:

- On Linux: `libedboci.so`

- On Windows: `edboci.dll`

The files are installed in the `oci/lib` subdirectory.

## Compiling and linking a sample program in Linux

This example compiles and links the sample program `edb_demo.c` in a Linux environment. 
The `edb_demo.c` file is located in the `oci/samples` subdirectory.

1.  Set `ORACLE_HOME` to the complete pathname of the Oracle home directory, for example:

    ```bash
    export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/lib/oracle/xe/app/oracle/product/10.2.0/server
    ```

1.  Set `EDB_HOME` to the complete pathname of the home directory, for example:

    ```bash
    export EDB_HOME=/usr/edb
    ```

1.  Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to the complete path of `libpthread.so`. By default, `libpthread.so` is located in `/lib64`.

    ```bash
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/lib64/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ```

1.  Set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` to include the EDB Postgres Advanced Server Open Client library. By default, `libedboci.so` is located in `$EDB_HOME/oci/lib`.

    ```bash
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$EDB_HOME/oci:$EDB_HOME/oci/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
    ```

1.  Compile and link the OCL API program:

    ```text
    cd $EDB_HOME/oci/samples
    make
    ```

## Compiling and linking a sample program in Windows

This example compiles and links the sample program `edb_demo.c` in a Windows 64 bit environment.

1. In Visual Studio Code 64-bit for Windows, open a terminal to conduct the compiling and linking procedure.

1. Change to the `samples` directory in the `edb-oci` installation directory:

   ```bash
   cd "c:\Program Files\edb\oci\samples"
   ```

1. Compile the sample assuming Oracle headers are in `c:\oracle_client\include\`:

   ```bash
   cl edb_demo.c /I c:\oracle_client\include\ -D WIN32 /link /libpath:"c:\Program Files\edb\oci\lib\" edboci.lib
   ```

1. Set the path to include the path to `edb-oci` dlls:

   ```bash
   set path=%path%;C:\Program Files\edb\oci\;C:\Program Files\edb\oci\lib
   ```

1. Finally, run the sample:

   ```bash
   edb_demo.exe
   ```
