If you have an existing OCL Connector installation on a Linux platform, you can upgrade your repository configuration file, which enables access to the current EDB repository. Then you can upgrade to a more recent version of OCL Connector.

To update the `edb.repo` file:

```shell
# Update your repository configuration file
sudo <package-manager> upgrade edb-repo

# Upgrade the installed product
sudo <package-manager> upgrade edb-oci

sudo <package-manager> upgrade edb-oci-devel
```

Where `<package-manager>` is the package manager used with your operating system:

  | Package manager |         Operating system         |
  | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | dnf             | RHEL 8/9 and derivatives         |
  | zypper          | SLES                             |
  | apt-get         | Debian and Ubuntu                |
