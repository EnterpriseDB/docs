To open an EDB\*Plus command line, navigate through the **Applications** or **Start** menu to the **EDB Postgres Advanced Server** menu. Select **Run SQL Command Line > EDB\*Plus**. You can also invoke EDB\*Plus from the operating system command line with the following command:

```text
edbplus [ -S[ILENT ] ] [ <login> | /NOLOG ] [ @<scriptfile>[.<ext> ] ]
```

`SILENT`

 If specified, the EDB\*Plus sign-on banner is suppressed along with all prompts.

`login`

 Login information for connecting to the database server and database. `login` takes the following form. Don't use any white space in the login information.

```text
<username>[/<password>][@{<connectstring> | <variable> } ]
```


 `username` is a database username with which to connect to the database.

 `password` is the password associated with the specified username. If you don't provide a password but a password is required for authentication, a password file is used if available. If there's no password file or no entry in the password file with the matching connection parameters, then EDB\*Plus prompts for the password.

 `connectstring` is the database connection string with the following format:

```text
<host>[:<port>][/<dbname>][?ssl={true | false}]
```

 `host` is the hostname or IP address on which the database server resides. If you don't specify `@connectstring`, `@variable`, or `/NOLOG`, the default host is assumed to be the localhost. 
 
 `port` is the port number receiving connections on the database server. The default is `5444`. 
 
 `dbname` is the name of the database to connect to. The default is `edb`. 
 
 If `Internet Protocol version 6` (IPv6) is used for the connection instead of IPv4, then the IP address must be enclosed in square brackets (that is, `[ipv6_address]`). The following is an example using an IPv6 connection:

```text
edbplus.sh enterprisedb/password@[fe80::20c:29ff:fe7c:78b2]:5444/edb
```

 The `pg_hba.conf` file for the database server must contain an appropriate entry for the IPv6 connection. The following example shows an entry that allows all addresses:

```text
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER         ADDRESS           METHOD
host    all             all          ::0/0             md5
```

For more information about the `pg_hba.conf` file, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

 If you want an SSL connection, then include the `?ssl=true` parameter in the connection string. In such a case, the connection string must minimally include `host:port`, with or without `/dbname`. The default for the `ssl` parameter is `false`. See [Using a secure sockets layer (SSL) connection](05_using_edb_plus_with_ssl/#using_edb_plus_with_ssl) for instructions on setting up an SSL connection.

 `variable` is a variable defined in the `login.sql` file that contains a database connection string. The `login.sql` file can be found in the `edbplus` subdirectory of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server home directory.

`/NOLOG`

 Specify `/NOLOG` to start EDB\*Plus without establishing a database connection. In this mode, you can't use SQL commands and EDB\*Plus commands that require a database connection. You can later give the `CONNECT` command to connect to a database after starting EDB\*Plus with the `/NOLOG` option.

`scriptfile[.ext ]`

 `scriptfile` is the name of a file residing in the current working directory, containing SQL and/or EDB\*Plus commands that execute after startup of EDB\*Plus. `ext` is the filename extension. If the filename extension is `sql`, then you can omit the `.sql` extension. When creating a script file, always name the file with an extension. Otherwise EDB\*Plus can't access it. EDB\*Plus assumes a `.sql` extension on filenames that are specified with no extension.

The following example shows user `enterprisedb` with password `password` connecting to database `edb` running on a database server on the localhost at port 5444.

```text
C:\Program Files\edb\as14\edbplus>edbplus enterprisedb/password
Connected to EnterpriseDB 14.0.0 (localhost:5444/edb) AS enterprisedb

EDB*Plus: Release 14 (Build 40.0.1)

SQL>
```

The following example shows user `enterprisedb` with password `password` connecting to database `edb` running on a database server on the localhost at port 5445.

```text
C:\Program Files\edb\as14\edbplus>edbplus enterprisedb/password@localhost:5445/edb
Connected to EnterpriseDB 14.0.0 (localhost:5445/edb) AS enterprisedb

EDB*Plus: Release 14 (Build 40.0.1)
Copyright (c) 2008-2021, EnterpriseDB Corporation. All rights reserved.

SQL>
```

Using variable `hr_5445` in the `login.sql` file, the following shows how it is used to connect to database `hr` on localhost at port 5445.

```text
C:\Program Files\edb\as14\edbplus>edbplus enterprisedb/password@hr_5445
Connected to EnterpriseDB 14.0.0 (localhost:5445/hr) AS enterprisedb

EDB*Plus: Release 14 (Build 40.0.1)
Copyright (c) 2008-2021, EnterpriseDB Corporation. All rights reserved.

SQL>
```

The following is the content of the `login.sql` file used in this example.

```text
define edb="localhost:5445/edb"
define hr_5445="localhost:5445/hr"
```

The following example executes a script file, `dept_query.sql`, after connecting to database `edb` on server localhost at port 5444.

```text
C:\Program Files\edb\as14\edbplus>edbplus enterprisedb/password @dept_query
Connected to EnterpriseDB 14.0.0 (localhost:5444/edb) AS enterprisedb

SQL> SELECT * FROM dept;

DEPTNO DNAME          LOC
------ -------------- -------------
10     ACCOUNTING     NEW YORK
20     RESEARCH       DALLAS
30     SALES          CHICAGO
40     OPERATIONS     BOSTON

SQL> EXIT
Disconnected from EnterpriseDB Database.
```

The following is the content of file `dept_query.sql` used in this example.

```text
SET PAGESIZE 9999
SET ECHO ON
SELECT * FROM dept;
EXIT
```
