1. To install the IBM Advance Toolchain repository:
    ```text
    rpm --import https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/Linux/toolchain/at/redhat/RHEL7/gpg-pubkey-6976a827-5164221b
    ```

    The repository configuration file is named `advance-toolchain.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

1. After creating the `advance-toolchain.repo` file, the `enabled` parameter is set to `1` by default.
    ```text
    [advance-toolchain]
    name=Advance Toolchain IBM FTP
    baseurl=https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/Linux/
    toolchain/at/redhat/RHEL7
    failovermethod=priority
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/Linux/
    toolchain/at/redhat/RHELX/gpg-pubkey-6976a827-5164221b
    ```

1. To install the EDB repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke thefollowing command:
    ```text
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

1. Replace the `USERNAME:PASSWORD` variable in the following command with the username and password of a registered EDB user:
    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

1. Before installing EDB\*Plus, install the `epel-release` package:
    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

1. Enable the `optional`, `extras`, and `HA` repositories to satisfy package dependencies:
    ```text
    subscription-manager repos --enable "rhel-*-optional-rpms" --enable "rhel-*-extras-rpms"  --enable "rhel-ha-for-rhel-*-server-rpms"
    ```
    
    The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`. 
    
1. After saving your changes to the configuration file, install EDB\*Plus:
    ```text
    yum -y install edb-asxx-edbplus
    ```
    
    Where, `xx` is the Advanced Server version.

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, `yum` may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, `yum` may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.
