## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on the same host. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux).

- Install Java (version 1.8 or later) on your server, if not present.

  ```shell
  sudo dnf -y install java
  ```

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Address other prerequisites

  ```shell
  # Install the EPEL repository:
  sudo dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

  # Refresh the cache:
  sudo dnf makecache
  #  Enable additional repositories to resolve dependencies:
  ARCH=$( /bin/arch ) subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"

  #  Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:
  sudo dnf -qy module disable postgresql

  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-as<xx>-edbplus
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server. For example, if you are installing with version 14 of EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the package name would be `edb-as14-edbplus`.

## Initial configuration

After performing a Linux installation of EDB\*Plus, you must set the values of environment variables that allow EDB\*Plus to locate your Java installation:

```shell
export JAVA_HOME=<path_to_java>
export PATH=<path_to_java>/bin:$PATH
```
