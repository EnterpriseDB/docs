title: Installing EDB*Plus on SLES 15 x86_64
---

Before you begin the installation process, log in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

## Set up the repository

Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step. If you do need to set up the repository, you must register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

```shell
# Install the repository configuration and enter your EDB repository
# credentials when prompted
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access
# to SUSE repositories
zypper install SUSEConnect

# Register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
# Replace 'REGISTRATION_CODE' and 'EMAIL' with your SUSE
# registration information
SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'

# Activate the required SUSE module
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.3/x86_64

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh
```

## Install the package

```shell
zypper -n install edb-as<xx>-edbplus
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server. For example, if you are installing with version 14 of EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the package name would be `edb-as14-edbplus`.

## Initial configuration

After performing a Linux installation of EDB\*Plus, you must set the values of environment variables that allow EDB\*Plus to locate your Java installation. Use the following commands to set variable values:

```shell
export JAVA_HOME=<path_to_java>
export PATH=<path_to_java>/bin:$PATH
```
