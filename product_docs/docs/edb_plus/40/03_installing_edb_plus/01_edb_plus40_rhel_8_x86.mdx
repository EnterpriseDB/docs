To request credentials that allow you to access an EnterpriseDB repository, see the [EDB Repository Access instructions](https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf).

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that isn't recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press **Return** to continue.

During the installation, yum might encounter a dependency that it can't resolve. If it does, it provides a list of the required dependencies to manually resolve.

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```
