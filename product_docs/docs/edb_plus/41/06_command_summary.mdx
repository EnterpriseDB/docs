<div id="command_summary" class="registered_link"></div>

Use these commands with EDB\*Plus.

## ACCEPT

The `ACCEPT` command displays a prompt and waits for keyboard input. The value from the input is placed in the specified variable.

```sql
ACC[EPT ] variable
```

This example creates a new variable named `my_name`, accepts a value of `John Smith`, and then displays the value using the `DEFINE` command.

```sql
SQL> ACCEPT my_name
Enter value for my_name: John Smith
SQL> DEFINE my_name
DEFINE MY_NAME = "John Smith"
```

## APPEND

`APPEND` appends the given text to the end of the current line in the SQL buffer.

```sql
A[PPEND ] text
```

In this example, a `SELECT` command is built in the SQL buffer using the `APPEND` command. Two spaces are placed between the `APPEND` command and the `WHERE` clause to separate `dept` and `WHERE` by one space in the SQL buffer.

```sql
SQL> APPEND SELECT * FROM dept
SQL> LIST
  1 SELECT * FROM dept
SQL> APPEND WHERE deptno = 10
SQL> LIST
  1 SELECT * FROM dept WHERE deptno = 10
```

## CHANGE

`CHANGE` performs a search-and-replace on the current line in the SQL buffer.

```sql
C[HANGE ] FROM [ TO ]
```

If you specify `TO/`, the first occurrence of the text `FROM` in the current line is changed to text `TO`. If you omit `TO/`, the first occurrence of the text `FROM` in the current line is deleted.

This sequence of commands makes line 3 the current line and then changes the department number in the `WHERE` clause from 20 to 30.

```sql
SQL> LIST
  1  SELECT empno, ename, job, sal, comm
  2  FROM emp
  3  WHERE deptno = 20
  4* ORDER BY empno
SQL> 3
  3* WHERE deptno = 20
SQL> CHANGE /20/30/
  3* WHERE deptno = 30
SQL> LIST
  1  SELECT empno, ename, job, sal, comm
  2  FROM emp
  3  WHERE deptno = 30
  4* ORDER BY empno
```

## CLEAR

The `CLEAR` command removes the contents of the SQL buffer, deletes all column definitions set with the `COLUMN` command, or clears the screen.

```sql
CL[EAR ] [ BUFF[ER ] | SQL | COL[UMNS ] | SCR[EEN ] ]
```

`BUFFER | SQL`

 Clears the SQL buffer.

`COLUMNS`

 Removes column definitions.

`SCREEN`

 Clears the screen. This is the default.

## COLUMN

The `COLUMN` command controls output formatting. The formatting attributes set by using the `COLUMN` command remain in effect only for the current session.

```sql
COL[UMN] [column_name [CLE[AR] |
                       FOR[MAT] format_spec |
                       HEA[DING] heading_text |
                       NEW_V[ALUE] variable |
                       ON |
                       OFF...]]
```

If you specify the `COLUMN` command with no other options, formatting options for current columns in effect for the session are displayed.

If the `COLUMN` command is followed by a column name, then the column name can be followed by one of the following:

-  No other options
-  `CLEAR`
-  Any combination of `FORMAT`, `HEADING`, `NEW_VALUE` and either `OFF` or `ON`

`column_name`

 Name of a column in a table to which column formatting options apply. If no other options follow `column_name`, then the current column formatting options of `column_name`, if any, are displayed.

`CLEAR`

 The `CLEAR` option reverts all formatting options to their defaults for `column_name`. If you specify the `CLEAR` option, it must be the only option specified.

`format_spec`

 Format specification to apply to `column_name`. For character columns, `format_spec` takes the following format:

`n`

 `n` is a positive integer that specifies the column width in characters within which to display the data. Data in excess of `n` wraps around with the specified column width.

 For numeric columns, `format_spec` is made up of the following elements.

| Element | Description                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `$`     | Display a leading dollar sign.             |
| `,`     | Display a comma in the indicated position. |
| `.`     | Marks the location of the decimal point.   |
| `0`     | Display leading zeros.                     |
| `9`     | Number of significant digits to display.   |

 If loss of significant digits occurs due to overflow of the format, then all #s are displayed.

`heading_text`

 Text to use for the column heading of `column_name`.

`NEW_V[ALUE]` 

This variable option is valid if specified alone or with other already supported options. A variable specified in the `COLUMN` command option is associated with the given column. The variable can contain the data value of a column or expression of a variable in the SQL `SELECT` list. You can use it in the SQL script for the rest of the session.  

To contain the `departmentnumber` value for the `deptno` column, you can define a variable using the `NEW_VALUE` option:

```sql
SQL> column deptno new_value departmentnumber
SQL> select deptno,dname from dept;

DEPTNO DNAME         
------ --------------
    10 ACCOUNTING    
    20 RESEARCH      
    30 SALES         
    40 OPERATIONS    

SQL> prompt departmentnumber: '&departmentnumber'
departmentnumber: '40'
SQL> INSERT INTO emp VALUES (1,'micheal','tester',7902,'17-DEC-80',800,NULL,'&departmentnumber');

1 row INSERTED.
```

The `NEW_V[ALUE]` variable has the following limitations: 

- Column values differ when they're seeded using the `NEW_VALUE` parameter for the "time with time zone" data type.
- The `NEW_VALUE` variable prompts for the value if the corresponding column value is `NULL`. Oracle treats `NULL` and an empty string the same, while EDB Postgres Advanced Server has a different behavior. Therefore, in EDB\*Plus it prompts for the value.
- The variable value doesn't show in the `COLUMN` header if you reference the `NEW_VALUE` variable in a `SELECT` query without an alias.

`OFF | ON`

 If you specify `OFF`, formatting options revert to their defaults but are still available in the session. If you specify `ON`, the formatting options specified by previous `COLUMN` commands for `column_name` in the session are reactivated.

This example shows the effect of changing the display width of the `job` column:

```sql
SQL> SET PAGESIZE 9999
SQL> COLUMN job FORMAT A5
SQL> COLUMN job
COLUMN   JOB  ON
FORMAT   A5
wrapped
SQL> SELECT empno, ename, job FROM emp;
__OUTPUT__
EMPNO ENAME      JOB

This example applies a format to the `sal` column:

```sql
SQL> COLUMN sal FORMAT $99,999.00
SQL> COLUMN
COLUMN   JOB  ON
FORMAT   A5
wrapped

COLUMN   SAL  ON
FORMAT   $99,999.00

```

## CONNECT

Change the database connection to a different user or connect to a different database. There must be no white space between any of the parameters following the `CONNECT` command. The syntax is:

```sql
CON[NECT] <username>[/<password>][@{<connectstring> | <variable> } ]
```

Where:

 `username` is a database username with which to connect to the database.

 `password` is the password associated with the specified username. If you don't provide a password, but a password is required for authentication, a search is made for a password file. The search looks first in the home directory of the Linux operating system account invoking EDB\*Plus (or in the `%APPDATA%\postgresql\` directory for Windows) and then at the location specified by the `PGPASSFILE` environment variable. The password file is `.pgpass` on Linux hosts and `pgpass.conf` on Windows hosts. The following is an example on a Windows host:

```text
C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\postgresql\pgpass.conf
```

 If a password file can't be located or it doesn't have an entry matching the EDB\*Plus connection parameters, then EDB\*Plus prompts for the password. For more information about password files, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-pgpass.html).

 !!! Note
  When a password isn't required, EDB\*Plus doesn't prompt for a password, such as when the `trust` authentication method is specified in the `pg_hba.conf` file. For more information about the `pg_hba.conf` file and authentication methods, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

 `connectstring` is the database connection string. See [Using EDB\*Plus](04_using_edb_plus/#using_edb_plus) for more information about the database connection string.

 `variable` is a variable defined in the `login.sql` file that contains a database connection string. The `login.sql` file is in the `edbplus` subdirectory of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server home directory.

In this example, the database connection is changed to database `edb` on the localhost at port `5445` with username `smith`.

```sql
SQL> CONNECT smith/mypassword@localhost:5445/edb
Disconnected from EnterpriseDB Database.
Connected to EnterpriseDB 16.4.1 (localhost:5445/edb) AS smith
```

In this session, the connection is changed to the username `enterprisedb`. The host defaults to the localhost, the port defaults to `5444` (which isn't the same as the port previously used), and the database defaults to `edb`.

```sql
SQL> CONNECT enterprisedb/password
Disconnected from EnterpriseDB Database.
Connected to EnterpriseDB 16.4.1 (localhost:5444/edb) AS enterprisedb
```

This example shows connectivity for a multi-node cluster (one primary node and two secondary nodes) setup. The given multi-host `connectstring` syntax is used to establish a connection with the active primary database server. In this case, using `CONNECT` command, the connection is established with the primary database node on host `192.168.22.24` at port `5444`.

```sql
SQL> CONNECT enterprisedb/edb@192.168.22.24:5444,192.168.22.25:5445,192.168.22.26:5446/edb?targetServerType=primary
Disconnected from EnterpriseDB Database.
Connected to EnterpriseDB 16.4.1 (192.168.22.24:5444/edb) AS enterprisedb
```

## DEFINE

The `DEFINE` command creates or replaces the value of a *user variable* (also called a *substitution variable*).

```sql
DEF[INE ] [ variable [ = text ] ]
```

If you give the `DEFINE` command without any parameters, all current variables and their values are displayed.

If `DEFINE variable` is given, only `variable` is displayed with its value.

`DEFINE variable = text` assigns `text` to `variable.text`, which you can optionally enclose in single or double quotation marks. Quotation marks must be used if `text` contains space characters.

This example defines two variables, `dept` and `name`:

```sql
SQL> DEFINE dept = 20
SQL> DEFINE name = 'John Smith'
SQL> DEFINE
DEFINE EDB = "localhost:5445/edb"
DEFINE DEPT = "20"
DEFINE NAME = "John Smith"
```

!!! Note
    The variable `EDB` is read from the `login.sql` file located in the `edbplus` subdirectory of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server home directory.

## DEL

`DEL` deletes one or more lines from the SQL buffer.

```sql
DEL [ n | n m | n * | n L[AST ] | * | * n | * L[AST ] | L[AST ] ]
```

The parameters specify the lines to delete from the SQL buffer. Two parameters specify the start and end of a range of lines to delete. Giving the `DEL` command without parameters deletes the current line.

`n`

 `n` is an integer representing the nth line.

`n m`

 `n` and `m` are integers, where `m` is greater than `n` representing the nth through the mth lines.

`*`

 Current line.

`LAST`

 Last line.

This example deletes the fifth and sixth lines, which contain columns `sal` and `comm`, respectively, from the `SELECT` command in the SQL buffer.

```sql
SQL> LIST
  1  SELECT
  2    empno
  3   ,ename
  4   ,job
  5   ,sal
  6   ,comm
  7   ,deptno
  8* FROM emp
SQL> DEL 5 6
SQL> LIST
  1  SELECT
  2    empno
  3   ,ename
  4   ,job
  5   ,deptno
  6* FROM emp
```

## DESCRIBE

The `DESCRIBE` command displays:

-   A list of columns, column data types, and column lengths for a table or view
-   A list of parameters for a procedure or function
-   A list of procedures and functions and their respective parameters for a package

The `DESCRIBE` command also displays the structure of the database object referred to by a synonym. The syntax is:

```sql
DESC[RIBE] [ schema.]object
```

`schema`

 Name of the schema containing the object to describe.

`object`

 Name of the table, view, procedure, function, or package to display or the synonym of an object.

## DISCONNECT

The `DISCONNECT` command closes the current database connection but doesn't end the EDB\*Plus session.

```sql
DISC[ONNECT ]
```

## EDIT

The `EDIT` command invokes an external editor to edit the contents of an operating system file or the SQL buffer.

```sql
ED[IT ] [ filename[.ext ] ]
```

`filename[.ext ]`

 `filename` is the name of the file to open with an external editor. `ext` is the filename extension. If the  extension is `sql`, then you can omit it. (`EDIT` assumes a `.sql` extension on filenames that are specified with no extension.) If you omit the `filename` parameter from the `EDIT` command, the contents of the SQL buffer are brought into the editor.

## EXECUTE

The `EXECUTE` command executes an SPL procedure from EDB\*Plus.

```sql
EXEC[UTE ] spl_procedure [ ([ parameters ]) ]
```

`spl_procedure`

 The name of the SPL procedure to execute.

`parameters`

 Comma-delimited list of parameters. If there are no parameters, then you can optionally specify a pair of empty parentheses.

## EXIT

The `EXIT` command ends the EDB\*Plus session and returns control to the operating system. `QUIT` is a synonym for `EXIT`. Specifying no parameters is equivalent to `EXIT SUCCESS COMMIT`.

```sql
{ EXIT | QUIT }
[ SUCCESS | FAILURE | WARNING | value | variable ]
[ COMMIT | ROLLBACK ]SUCCESS | FAILURE |WARNING]
```

Returns an operating-system-dependent return code indicating successful operation, failure, or warning for `SUCCESS`, `FAILURE`, and `WARNING`, respectively. The default is `SUCCESS`.

`value`

 An integer value returned as the return code.

`variable`

 A variable created with the `DEFINE` command whose value is returned as the return code.

`COMMIT | ROLLBACK`

 If you specify `COMMIT`, uncommitted updates are committed upon exit. If you specify `ROLLBACK`, uncommitted updates are rolled back upon exit. The default is `COMMIT`.

## GET

The `GET` command loads the contents of the given file to the SQL buffer.

```sql
GET filename[.ext ] [ LIS[T ] | NOL[IST ] ]
```

`filename[.ext ]`

 `filename` is the name of the file to load into the SQL buffer. `ext` is the filename extension. If the extension is `sql`, then you can omit it. `GET` assumes a `.sql` extension on filenames that are specified with no extension.

`LIST | NOLIST`

 If you specify `LIST`, the contents of the SQL buffer are displayed after the file is loaded. If you specify `NOLIST`, no listing is displayed. The default is `LIST`.

## HELP

The `HELP` command gets an index of topics or help on a specific topic. The question mark `(?)` is synonymous with specifying `HELP`.

```sql
{ HELP | ? } { INDEX | topic }
```

`INDEX`

 Displays an index of available topics.

`topic`

 The name of a specific topic, such as an EDB\*Plus command, for which you want help.

## HOST

The `HOST` command executes an operating system command from EDB\*Plus.

```sql
HO[ST ] [os_command]
```

`os_command`

 The operating system command to execute. If you don't provide an operating system command, EDB\*Plus pauses and opens a new shell prompt. When the shell exits, EDB\*Plus resumes execution.

## INPUT

The `INPUT` command adds a line of text to the SQL buffer after the current line.

```sql
I[NPUT ] text
```

This sequence of `INPUT` commands constructs a `SELECT` command:

```sql
SQL> INPUT SELECT empno, ename, job, sal, comm
SQL> INPUT FROM emp
SQL> INPUT WHERE deptno = 20
SQL> INPUT ORDER BY empno
SQL> LIST
  1 SELECT empno, ename, job, sal, comm
  2 FROM emp
  3 WHERE deptno = 20
  4* ORDER BY empno
```

## LIST

`LIST` displays the contents of the SQL buffer.

```sql
L[IST] [ n | n m | n * | n L[AST] | * | * n | * L[AST] | L[AST] ]
```

The buffer doesn't include a history of the EDB\*Plus commands.

`n`

 `n` represents the buffer line number.

`n m`

 `n m` displays a list of lines between `n` and `m`.

`n *`

 `n *` displays a list of lines that range between line `n` and the current line.

`n L[AST]`

 `n L[AST]` displays a list of lines that range from line `n` through the last line in the buffer.

`*`

 `*` displays the current line.

`* n`

 `* n` displays a list of lines that range from the current line through line `n`.

`* L[AST]`

 `* L[AST]` displays a list of lines that range from the current line through the last line.

`L[AST]`

 `L[AST]` displays the last line.

## PASSWORD

Use the `PASSWORD` command to change your database password.

```sql
PASSW[ORD] [user_name]
```

You must have privileges to use the `PASSWORD` command to change another user's password. This example uses the `PASSWORD` command to change the password for a user named acctg:

```sql
SQL> PASSWORD acctg
Changing password for acctg
    New password:
    New password again:
Password successfully changed.
```

## PAUSE

The `PAUSE` command displays a message and waits for the user to press `ENTER`.

```sql
PAU[SE]  [optional_text]
```

`optional_text` specifies the text to display to the user. If you omit `optional_text`, EDB Postgres Advanced Server displays two blank lines. If you double quote the `optional_text` string, the quotes are included in the output.

## PROMPT

The `PROMPT` command displays a message to the user before continuing.

```sql
PRO[MPT] [message_text]
```

`message_text` specifies the text displayed to the user. Double quote the string to include quotes in the output.

## QUIT

The `QUIT` command ends the session and returns control to the operating system. `QUIT` is a synonym for `EXIT`.

```sql
QUIT

[SUCCESS | FAILURE | WARNING | value | sub_variable]

[COMMIT | ROLLBACK]
```

The default value is `QUIT SUCCESS COMMIT`.

## REMARK

Use `REMARK` to include comments in a script.

```sql
REM[ARK] [optional_text]
```

You can also use the following convention to include a comment:

```text
/*
 *  This is an example of a three-line comment.
 */
```

## SAVE

Use the `SAVE` command to write the SQL buffer to an operating system file.

```sql
SAV[E] file_name
[CRE[ATE] | REP[LACE] | APP[END]]
```

`file_name`

 `file_name` specifies the name of the file (including the path) where the buffer contents are written. If you don't provide a file extension, `.sql` is appended to the end of the filename.

`CREATE`

 Include the `CREATE` keyword to create a file. A file is created only if a file with the specified name doesn't already exist. This is the default.

`REPLACE`

 Include the `REPLACE` keyword to overwrite an existing file.

`APPEND`

 Include the `APPEND` keyword to append the contents of the SQL buffer to the end of the specified file.

This example saves the contents of the SQL buffer to a file named `example.sql`, located in the `temp` directory:

```sql
SQL> SAVE C:\example.sql CREATE
File "example.sql" written.
```

## SET

Use the `SET` command to specify a value for a session-level variable that controls EDB\*Plus behavior. The following forms of the `SET` command are valid.

### SET AUTOCOMMIT`

Use the `SET AUTOCOMMIT` command to specify commit behavior for EDB Postgres Advanced Server transactions.

```sql
SET AUTO[COMMIT]

{ON | OFF | IMMEDIATE | statement_count}
```

EDB\*Plus always automatically commits DDL statements.

`ON`

 Specify `ON` to turn on `AUTOCOMMIT` behavior.

`OFF`

 Specify `OFF` to turn off `AUTOCOMMIT` behavior.

`IMMEDIATE`

 `IMMEDIATE` has the same effect as `ON`.

`statement_count`

 Include a value for `statement_count` to issue a commit after the specified count of successful SQL statements.

### SET COLUMN SEPARATOR

Use the `SET COLUMN SEPARATOR` command to specify the text to display between columns.

```sql
SET COLSEP column_separator
```

The default value of `column_separator` is a single space.

### SET ECHO

Use the `SET ECHO` command to specify to display SQL and EDB\*Plus script statements onscreen as they execute.

```sql
SET ECHO {ON | OFF}
```

The default value is `OFF`.

### SET FEEDBACK

The `SET FEEDBACK` command controls the display of interactive information after a SQL statement executes.

```sql
SET FEED[BACK] {ON | OFF | row_threshold}
```

`row_threshold`

 Specify an integer value for `row_threshold`. Setting `row_threshold` to `0` is same as setting `FEEDBACK` to `OFF`. Setting `row_threshold` equal `1` effectively sets `FEEDBACK` to `ON`.

### SET FLUSH

Use the `SET FLUSH` command to control display buffering.

```sql
SET FLU[SH] {ON | OFF}
```

Set `FLUSH` to `OFF` to enable display buffering. If you enable buffering, messages bound for the screen might not appear until the script completes. Setting `FLUSH` to `OFF` offers better performance.

Set `FLUSH` to `ON` to disable display buffering. If you disable buffering, messages bound for the screen appear immediately.

### SET HEADING

Use the `SET HEADING` variable to specify whether to display column headings for `SELECT` statements.

```sql
SET HEA[DING] {ON | OFF}
```

### SET HEADSEP

The `SET HEADSEP` command sets the new heading separator character used by the `COLUMN HEADING` command. The default is `'|'`.

```sql
SET HEADS[EP]
```

### SET LINESIZE

Use the `SET LINESIZE` command to specify the width of a line in characters.

```sql
SET LIN[ESIZE] width_of_line
```

`width_of_line`

 The default value of `width_of_line` is `132`.

### SET NEWPAGE

Use the `SET NEWPAGE` command to specify how many blank lines to print after a page break.

```sql
SET NEWP[AGE] lines_per_page
```

`lines_per_page`

 The default value of `lines_per_page` is `1`.

### SET NULL

Use the `SET NULL` command to specify a string to display when a `NULL` column value is displayed in the output buffer.

```sql
SET NULL null_string
```

### SET PAGESIZE

Use the `SET PAGESIZE` command to specify the number of printed lines that fit on a page.

```sql
SET PAGES[IZE] line_count
```

Use the `line_count` parameter to specify the number of lines per page.

### SET SQLCASE

The `SET SQLCASE` command specifies whether to convert SQL statements transmitted to the server to upper or lower case.

```sql
SET SQLC[ASE] {MIX[ED] | UP[PER] | LO[WER]}
```

`UPPER`

 Specify `UPPER` to convert the command text to upper case.

`LOWER`

 Specify `LOWER` to convert the command text to lower case.

`MIXED`

 Specify `MIXED` to leave the case of SQL commands unchanged. The default is `MIXED`.

### SET PAUSE

The `SET PAUSE` command is most useful when included in a script. The command displays a prompt and waits for the user to press **Return**.

```sql
SET PAU[SE] {ON | OFF}
```

If `SET PAUSE` is `ON`, the message `Hit ENTER to continue…` appears before each command executes.

### SET SPACE

Use the `SET SPACE` command to specify the number of spaces to display between columns.

```sql
SET SPACE number_of_spaces
```

### SET SQLPROMPT

Use `SET SQLPROMPT` to set a value for a user-interactive prompt.

```sql
SET SQLP[ROMPT] "prompt"
```

By default, `SQLPROMPT` is set to `"SQL> "`

### SET TERMOUT

Use the `SET TERMOUT` command to specify to display command output.

```sql
SET TERM[OUT] {ON | OFF}
```

### SET TIMING`

The `SET TIMING` command specifies whether to display the execution time for each SQL statement after it executes.

```sql
SET TIMI[NG] {ON | OFF}
```

### SET TRIMSPOOL`

```

## SHOW

Use the `SHOW` command to display current parameter values.

```sql
SHO[W] {ALL | parameter_name}
```

Display the current parameter settings by including the `ALL` keyword:

```sql
SQL> SHOW ALL
autocommit      OFF
colsep          " "
define          "&"
echo            OFF
FEEDBACK ON for 6 row(s).
flush           ON
heading         ON
headsep         "|"
linesize        78
newpage         1
null            " "
pagesize        14
pause           OFF
serveroutput    OFF
spool           OFF
sqlcase         MIXED
sqlprompt       "SQL> "
sqlterminator   ";"
suffix          ".sql"
termout         ON
timing          OFF
verify          ON
USER is         "enterprisedb"
HOST is         "localhost"
PORT is         "5444"
DATABASE is     "edb"
VERSION is      "14.0.0"
```

Or display a specific parameter setting by including the `parameter_name` in the `SHOW` command:

```sql
SQL> SHOW VERSION
VERSION is "14.0.0"
```

## SPOOL

The `SPOOL` command sends output from the display to a file.

```sql
SP[OOL] output_file | OFF
```

Use the `output_file` parameter to specify a pathname for the output file.

## START

Use the `START` command to run an EDB\*Plus script file. `START` is an alias for the `@` command.

```sql
STA[RT] script_file
```

Specify the name of a script file in the `script_file` parameter.

## UNDEFINE

The `UNDEFINE` command erases a user variable created by the `DEFINE` command.

```sql
UNDEF[INE] variable_name [ variable_name...]
```

Use the `variable_name` parameter to specify the name of a variable or variables.

## WHENEVER SQLERROR

The `WHENEVER SQLERROR` command provides error handling for SQL errors or PL/SQL block errors. The syntax is:

```sql
WHENEVER SQLERROR
  {CONTINUE[COMMIT|ROLLBACK|NONE]
  |EXIT[SUCCESS|FAILURE|WARNING|n|sub_variable]
  [COMMIT|ROLLBACK]}
```

If EDB Postgres Advanced Server encounters an error while executing a SQL command or PL/SQL block, EDB\*Plus performs the action specified in the `WHENEVER SQLERROR` command:

- Include the `CONTINUE` clause to perform the specified action before continuing.

- Include the `COMMIT` clause to commit the current transaction before exiting or continuing.

- Include the `ROLLBACK` clause to roll back the current transaction before exiting or continuing.

- Include the `NONE` clause to continue without committing or rolling back the transaction.

- Include the `EXIT` clause to perform the specified action and exit in case of an error.

Use the following options to specify a status code that EDB\*Plus returns before exiting:

```sql
[SUCCESS|FAILURE|WARNING|n|sub_variable]
```

EDB\*Plus supports substitution variables but doesn't support bind variables.
