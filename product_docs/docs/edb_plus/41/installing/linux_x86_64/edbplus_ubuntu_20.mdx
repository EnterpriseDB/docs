## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install Java (version 1.8 or later) on your server, if not present.

  ```shell
  sudo apt-get -y install java
  ```

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

## Install the package

```shell
sudo apt-get -y install edb-edbplus
```

## Initial configuration

After performing a Linux installation of EDB\*Plus, you must set the values of environment variables that allow EDB\*Plus to locate your Java installation:

```shell
export JAVA_HOME=<path_to_java>
export PATH=<path_to_java>/bin:$PATH
```
