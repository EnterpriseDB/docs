| Type        | Description                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| Enhancement | EDB\*Plus now supports EDB Postgres Advanced Server 15. |
| Other       | Starting with EDB\*Plus 41 (this release), EDB\*Plus is now being installed in a separate path outside of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) installation path.  Any user processes or scripts with calls to EDB\*Plus that relied on EDB\*Plus being installed under EPAS specific directories, will need to be updated to use the new installation paths. On linux systems the new installation path is `/usr/edb/edbplus`. On Microsoft Windows systems, the default installation path is `C:\Program Files\edb\edbplus`. |
