| Enhancement  | EDB\*Plus has been certified for use with EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 17.                                                                                                                    |                       |
| Enhancement  | Enhanced the behavior where the `SET LINESIZE` command doesn't behave as expected when set to a value greater than 10. This enhancement mainly applies to the constants used in the select statement. | #103591 <br/>  #35673 |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Corrected the behavior where `SPOOL` was introducing redundant blank lines after each output.                                                                                                         | #37846                |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed the issue where EDB\*Plus is unable to process the command when `--` is used in between `/* */`.                                                                                                | #100496               |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed the issue causing the execution of a trivial procedural script to perform quite slowly in EDB\*Plus.                                                                                            | #37747                |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue related to the configuration of EDB\*Plus with SSL certificate authentication method when the password is not specified.                                                               | #37970                |
