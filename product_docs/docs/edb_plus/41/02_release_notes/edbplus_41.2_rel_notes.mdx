New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in EDB\*Plus 41.2.0 include:

| Type        | Description                                                    |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | 
| Enhancement | The connection string syntax in EDB\*Plus now supports multi-host connectivity. When multiple hosts are specified, you can also use the `targetServerType` connection property and set it to `primary` to ensure that EDB\*Plus always establishes a connection with the active primary EDB Postgres Database Server (EPAS) database server. [Support ticket #92553]  |
| Bug fix     | Fixed the issue whereby the ECHO command wasn't emitting the SQL statement in the spooled file when using EDB\*Plus in an interactive session. [Support ticket # 83580] |
