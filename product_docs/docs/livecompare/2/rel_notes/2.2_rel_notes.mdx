LiveCompare 2.2 includes the following new features, enhancements, and bug fixes:

| Type           | Description                                                                                                                                                                            | ID |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -- |
| New feature        | Added `--dry-run` execution mode, which allows users to validate the `.ini` file and view some useful comparison information, without running comparison session. See [Dry-run mode](../command_line_usage/#dry-run-mode) for more information. | LIV-142, RT78462 |
| Feature        | Any abort messages received during the comparison session are printed in chronological order. | |
| Feature        | Displays the list of connections, including technology, version, if the connection is a tiebreaker or a source of truth, and if it's reachable. | |
| Feature        | Displays the `Table Filter` if it is configured. | |
| Feature        | Lists the tables that are included in the comparison. This is the list of common tables that exist across all connections, after applying the `Table Filter`. For each table, shows the `Column Filter`, `Row Filter` and `Comparison Key`, if applicable. | |
| Enhancement    | Support for SLES 12 on x86_64. | LIV-112 |
| Enhancement    | Support for SLES 15 on x86_64. | LIV-113 |
| Enhancement    | Updated the list of reserved words according to Postgres `kwlist` source code. | LIV-141, RT80745 |
| Enhancement    | The main progress bar percentage is now using a float instead of an integer. Previously, the number was rounded up. | LIV-138, RT80745 |
| Enhancement    | When `edb_redwood_date` is enabled in EPAS, the `date` columns are created as `timestamp` columns. This type mismatch was previously detected as a mismatch in the Common Hash, which triggers a full row comparison. Performance is improved by handling this mismatch in the Common Hash (which is faster than a full row), by checking the `edb_redwood_date` setting in these cases. | LIV-153 |
| Enhancement    | Demoted hash mismatch log messages from WARNING to DEBUG. | LIV-145 |
| Enhancement    | Logs now include the `application_name` in the message. | LIV-141 |
| Enhancement    | Documented the behavior of using the current timestamp in `Row Filter` on Postgres or EPAS when `data_fetch_mode = prepared_statements` (the default). In this situation, it's also required to set `data_fetch_mode = server_side_cursors_with_hold` or `server_side_cursors_without_hold`. | LIV-155 |
| Enhancement    | Improved performance when generating the apply DML scripts when there is an increased number of divergences detected. | LIV-159 |
| Bug fix        | Fixed a problem where an array column being considered as a Comparison Key caused the comparison on a table to be aborted due to an exception. | LIV-38, LIV-154, RT81758 |
| Bug fix        | A problem was resolved where the number of divergent and processed rows was not being properly updated after the comparison round, only by a Heart Beat. In this case, the rows were outdated, showing only the position since the last Heart Beat. For tables where the comparison took less than `min_time_between_heart_beats`, it would always indicate zero. | LIV-149, RT75805 |
| Bug fix        | Fixed a corner case where unhandled exceptions could cause the comparison worker to hang. | LIV-140, RT80745 |
| Bug fix        | Normalizing decimal values to avoid false positives when comparing Oracle versus Postgres. | LIV-153 |
| Bug fix        | Fix a corner case in which if `comparison_algorithm = block_hash` and `buffer_size = 1`, and there were any divergences found, the comparison would not advance due to an issue in the cursor advancing algorithm. | LIV-150 |
| Bug fix        | Allow the same table to be configured in multiple filter sections. | LIV-156 |
