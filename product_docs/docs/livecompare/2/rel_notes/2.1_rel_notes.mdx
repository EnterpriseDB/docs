| Type           | Description                                                                                                                                                                            | ID |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -- |
| Feature        | Support for EDB Postgres Distributed 4.  | LIV-131 |
| Feature        | New setting `min_time_between_heart_beats`, which tells LiveCompare to log the comparison progress at every heart beat, by default set to 30 seconds using the `INFO` log level.       | LIV-128 |
| Feature        | New settings `comparison_cost_limit` and `comparison_cost_delay` that, when greater than 0, tell each worker to take a nap of `comparison_cost_delay` seconds (for example, `0.5`) after processing `comparison_cost_limit` number of rows. | LIV-16 | 
| Change         | Default value for `parallel_chunk_rows` set to `0`, which disables table splitting by default, as recent investigation proved to cause performance decrease for general use cases. For more information, see [Compare mode](/livecompare/latest/command_line_usage/#compare-mode). | LIV-130 |
| Change         | Demoted to `DEBUG` the log message about the number of processed rows from `CanAdvanceCursors` method. | LIV-129 |
| Bug fix        | Fixed an issue for Oracle versus Postgres comparisons of the `timestamp(6)` data type where failing with `ORA-01830`. | LIV-127 |
