LiveCompare is able to connect to and compare data from a list of technologies
including PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD, formerly known as BDR) and Oracle.

In LiveCompare there are 3 kinds of connections:

-   **Initial** (optional): Used to fetch metadata about pglogical or PGD
    connections. Required if data connections are pglogical or PGD, and if
    `replication_sets` or `node_name` settings are used. Requires
    `logical_replication_mode = pglogical` or `logical_replication_mode = bdr`. It
    is required to be a pglogical- or PGD-enabled database.
-   **Data**: The actual database connection that the tool will connect to perform
    data comparison. The first connection in the list is used to solve `Table
    Filter` and `Row Filter`, and is also used in conjunction with the Initial
    connection to gather information about PGD nodes. If
    `logical_replication_mode = bdr` and `all_bdr_nodes = on`, then LiveCompare will
    consider all PGD nodes that are part of the same PGD cluster as the `Initial
    Connection`. In this case it is not necessary to define Data connections
    individually. The fix can be potentially applied in all Data connections, as comparison
    and consensus decisions work per row.
-   **Output** (mandatory): Where LiveCompare will create a schema called
    `livecompare`, some tables and views. This is required to keep progress and
    reporting data about comparison sessions. It is required to be a PostgreSQL or
    2ndQPostgres connection.

Below you can find about versions and details about supported technologies and
in which context they can be used in LiveCompare.

| Technology                     | Versions                        | Connections                 |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| PostgreSQL                     | 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15 | Data and/or Output          |
| EDB PostgreSQL Extended        | 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15     | Data and/or Output          |
| EDB PostgreSQL Advanced (EPAS) | 11, 12, 13, 14 and 15               | Data and/or Output          |
| pglogical                      | 2 and 3                         | Initial, Data and/or Output |
| EDB Postgres Distributed       | 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5                   | Initial, Data and/or Output |
| Oracle                         | 11g, 12c, 18c, 19c and 21c      | A single Data connection    |

## PgBouncer Support

LiveCompare can be used against nodes through PgBouncer, but only if using
`pool_mode=session` because LiveCompare uses prepared statements on PostgreSQL,
and it would not be possible if `pool_mode` were either `transaction` or
`statement`.
