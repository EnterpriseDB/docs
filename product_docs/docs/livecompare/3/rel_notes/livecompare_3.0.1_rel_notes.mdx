| Platform&nbsp;Support | LiveCompare now supports the use of Python 3.10.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                                 |
| Enhancement           | LiveCompare tables in the cache database (`Output Connection`) are now `UNLOGGED`, which improves performance of writing to the cache database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | #103499 / 35636 #103402 / 35637 |
| Enhancement           | Added a new `consensus_mode = off` option where, if `comparison_algorithm = block_hash`, won't switch to a more granular comparison algorithm. This significantly improves the performance when divergences are found for a specific table, at the cost of not having the information about which rows are divergent. The user can subsequently run LiveCompare again adding the divergent tables, if any, to the `[Table Filter]` and compare only the divergent tables to get the information about which rows are divergent. | #103499 / 35636 #103402 / 35637 |
| Enhancement           | Replaced the `cx_Oracle` Python module with the new `oracledb` Python module, which is slightly faster and no longer requires the Oracle Instant Client.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | #103402 / 35637                 |
| Bug Fix               | Fixed an issue where `[Column Filter]` was not being honored when `comparison_algorithm = block_hash` was set.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | #103499 / 35636                 |
| Bug Fix               | Fixed an issue where the PK sort retrieved from the database wasn't being honored in Python memory, dragging performance down.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | #103499 / 35636 #103402 / 35637 |
| Deprecation           | Removed the Table Splitting feature, which could drag performance down and was obsolete since LiveCompare version 2.1. The `parallel_chunk_rows` setting was removed as a byproduct of this update.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                 |
| Deprecation           | Removed the `force_collate` setting as a byproduct of fixing the PK sorting issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | #35656                          |


!!! Note
LiveCompare 3.0/3.0.1 removed support for the `parallel_chunk_rows` and `force_collate` settings. If these settings are included in any existing .ini files, be sure to remove these settings prior to using the .ini files with LiveCompare 3.0.
