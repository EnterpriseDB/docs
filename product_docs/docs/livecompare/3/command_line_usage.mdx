## Compare mode

Create a `.ini` file to configure LiveCompare. See [Settings](settings/) for a description of the various configuration options.

For example, a basic template contains:

```ini
; Â© Copyright EnterpriseDB UK Limited 2019-2024 - All rights reserved.

[General Settings]
logical_replication_mode = off
max_parallel_workers = 2

[First Connection]
dsn = host=192.168.0.100 port=5432 dbname=live1 user=postgres

[Second Connection]
dsn = host=192.168.0.200 port=5432 dbname=live2 user=postgres

[Third Connection]
dsn = host=192.168.0.200 port=5432 dbname=live3 user=postgres

[Output Connection]
dsn = port=5432 dbname=liveoutput user=postgres

[Table Filter]
schemas = schema_name = 'public'
```

This basic template compares three connections, `live1`, `live2`, and `live3`, and outputs the results to the `liveoutput` database. LiveCompare uses only the `public` schema in the comparison.

### Running the comparison

To run the comparison, run livecompare and pass it the name of your settings file as an argument. If you created a `my_project.ini` file, execute the following command:

```
livecompare my_project.ini
```

While LiveCompare executes, N+1 progress bars appear, where N is the number of processes. (You can specify the number of processes in the settings.) The first progress bar shows overall execution. The other progress bars show the current table being processed by a specific process.

The information being shown for each table is, from left to right:

-   Number of the process
-   Table name
-   Status, which can be the ID of the comparison round followed by the current table chunk. 
    
    `p1/1` means the table wasn't split. A status of `setup` means the table is being analyzed (checking row count and splitting if necessary).

-   Number of rows processed
-   Number of total rows being considered in this comparison round
-   Time elapsed
-   Estimated time to complete
-   Speed in records per second

While the program is executing, you can cancel it at any time by pressing **Ctrl-C**. A message like the following appears:

```text
Manually stopping session 6... You can resume the session with:

livecompare my_project.ini 6
```

!!! Important
    If LiveCompare is running in the background or running in another shell, you can still softly stop it. It  keeps the `PID` of the master process inside the session folder (`lc_session_6` in the example) in a file named `livemaster.pid`. You can then invoke `kill -2 <PID>` to softly stop it.

Then, at any time you can resume a previously canceled session, for example:

```
livecompare my_project.ini 6
```

When the program ends, if it found no inconsistencies, the output is similar to the following:

```text
Saved file lc_session_5/summary_20190514.out with the complete table summary.
You can also get the table summary by connecting to the output database and executing:
select * from livecompare.vw_table_summary where session_id = 5;

Elapsed time: 0:02:10.970954
Processed 3919015 rows in 6 tables using 3 processes.
Found 0 inconsistent rows in 0 tables.
```

If any inconsistencies were found, the output looks like this:

```text
Comparison finished, waiting for remaining difference checks...

Outstanding differences:

+--------------+-------------------+-----------------+------------------+----------------------+-------------------+---------------------------+
|   session_id | table_name        | elapsed_time    |   num_total_rows |   num_processed_rows |   num_differences |   max_num_ignored_columns |

+--------------+-------------------+-----------------+------------------+----------------------+-------------------+---------------------------+

Saved file lc_session_6/summary_20200129.out with the complete table summary.
You can also get the table summary by connecting to the output database and executing:
select * from livecompare.vw_table_summary where session_id = 6;

Elapsed time: 0:00:50.149987
Processed 172718 rows in 8 tables from 3 connections using 2 workers.
Found 4 inconsistent rows in 1 tables.

Saved file lc_session_6/differences_20200129.out with the list of differences per table.
You can also get a list of differences per table with:
select * from livecompare.vw_differences where session_id = 6;
Too see more details on how LiveCompare determined the differences:
select * from livecompare.vw_consensus where session_id = 6;

Script lc_session_6/apply_on_the_first_20200129.sql was generated, which can be applied to the first connection and make it consistent with the majority of connections.
You can also get this script with:
select difference_fix_dml from livecompare.vw_difference_fix where session_id = 6 and connection_id = 'first';
```

## Recheck mode

In a PGD environment, any divergence that PGD finds can later not exist, as the replication caught up due to eventual consistency. Depending on several factors, replication lag can cause LiveCompare to report false positives.

To overcome that, in a later moment when replication lag has decreased or data has already caught up, you can manually execute a recheck only on the differences that were previously found. This execution mode is called *recheck*. You can execute it like this:

```
livecompare my_project.ini 6 --recheck
```

In this mode, LiveCompare generates separate recheck logs and updates all reports that already exist in the `lc_session_X` directory.

!!! Important
    If resuming a `compare` or executing under `recheck`, LiveCompare checks whether the settings and connections attributes are the same as when the session was created. If any divergence is found, it quits the execution and gives a message.

## Conflicts mode

To run LiveCompare in `conflicts` mode, invoke it with:

```
livecompare my_project.ini --conflicts
```

For more details about the `conflicts` mode, see [PGD support](bdr_support/).

## Dry-run mode

Dry-run mode allows you to run the comparison without actually executing it. This mode is useful for checking the configuration before running the comparison.

For example, suppose you have the following INI file:

```ini
[General Settings]
logical_replication_mode = off
difference_tie_breakers = first

[First Connection]
dsn = dbname=testb

[Second Connection]
dsn = dbname=testdb2

[Third Connection]
dsn = dbname=testdb3

[Output Connection]
dsn = dbname=liveoutpu

[Table Filter]
schemas = schema_name = 'public'
```

As the DSN under `Output Connection` (the LiveCompare cache database) is incorrect due to a misspelling of `liveoutput`, running LiveCompare initially fails with:

```
Output connection is not reachable.
```

After fixing this, then the output connection is now reachable. But suppose that only one of the data connections is set correctly. In that case, LiveCompare fails again with:

```
At least two reachable connections are required.
Following connections are unreachable: first, third.
Following connections are reachable: second.
```

LiveCompare can start a comparison with at least two data connections available. So you go ahead and fix the third connection. But LiveCompare still fails with:

```
A difference_tie_breakers host is not a reachable connection: first.
```

This happens because the example set `difference_tie_breakers = first`, and any connection set as a tie breaker or source of truth needs to be reachable.

After fixing all those issues, then LiveCompare can start the comparison.

However, when setting up a comparison from scratch, you can check beforehand whether LiveCompare will abort with a configuration error. Further checks of this nature are all shown in the order LiveCompare performs them.

You can do this with the `--dry-run` mode, which:

-   Prints all execution aborts that will happen due to configuration issues.
-   Prints the list of connections with some details, including if it's reachable.
-   Prints the table filter.
-   After applying the table filter, prints the list of tables that are common to the reachable connections.

Here's one sample output, given the example `.ini` file, and all configuration errors regarding unreachable connections:

```
$ livecompare test.ini --dry-run
EnterpriseDB LiveCompare 2.2.0, dry-run mode


Output connection is not reachable.

At least two reachable connections are required.
Following connections are unreachable: first, third.
Following connections are reachable: second.

A difference_tie_breakers host is not a reachable connection: first.
