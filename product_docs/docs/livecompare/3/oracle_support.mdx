You can use LiveCompare to compare data from an Oracle database against any number of PostgreSQL or PGD databases.

For example, you can define `technology = oracle` in a data connection. You can then use other settings to define the connection to Oracle:

-   `host`
-   `port`
-   `service`
-   `user`
-   `password`

All other data connections must be PostgreSQL.

The `user` you use to connect to Oracle must have the privileges needed to read the data from the tables you want to compare. Specifically, these privileges are `CONNECT`, `SELECT ANY TABLE`, and `SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE`. These can be granted with the command:

```sql
GRANT CONNECT, SELECT ANY TABLE, SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE TO username;
```

Where `username` is the user you want to use to connect to Oracle.

Here's a simple example of comparison between an Oracle database and a PostgreSQL database:

```ini
[General Settings]
logical_replication_mode = off
max_parallel_workers = 4
oracle_user_tables_only = on
oracle_ignore_unsortable = on
column_intersection = on
difference_tie_breakers = oracle

[Oracle Connection]
technology = oracle
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 1521
service = XE
user = LIVE
password = live

[Postgres Connection]
technology = postgresql
dsn = dbname=liveoracle user=william

[Output Connection]
dsn = dbname=liveoutput user=william

[Table Filter]
schemas = schema_name = 'live'
```

Here, the `schema_name` in Oracle is the user table sandbox. All table names are schema qualified by default:

-   Postgres: `<schema_name> . <table_name>`
-   Oracle: `<user> . <table_name`

You can disable schema-qualified table names by setting `schema_qualified_table_names = off`. You can do this only if `oracle_user_tables_only = on`. This setting tells LiveCompare to search only on tables that belong to the Oracle user that's connected. When schema-qualified table names is disabled, then on Postgres you need to have set a default `search_path` on your role or configuration. Or, you can use the connection `start_query` parameter to set an appropriate `search_path`, for example:

```ini
[General Settings]
logical_replication_mode = off
max_parallel_workers = 4
oracle_user_tables_only = on
oracle_ignore_unsortable = on
column_intersection = on
difference_tie_breakers = oracle
schema_qualified_table_names = off

[Oracle Connection]
technology = oracle
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 1521
service = XE
user = LIVE
password = live

[Postgres Connection]
technology = postgresql
dsn = dbname=liveoracle user=william
start_query = SET search_path = myschema1, myschema2, public

[Output Connection]
dsn = dbname=liveoutput user=william

[Table Filter]
tables = table_name in ('mytable1', 'mytable2')
```

When `schema_qualified_table_names = off`, you can also use non-qualified table names in `Table Filter`, `Row Filter`, and `Column Filter`.

!!! Note
    The `Output Connection` is required to write progress and reporting information from LiveCompare.

If you need to compare a PGD database against Oracle, and you want to take advantage of `Initial Connection`, `node_name`, and `replication_sets` features (described in [PGD support](bdr_support/)), then you can point the last data connection to Oracle, like this:

```ini
[General Settings]
logical_replication_mode = bdr
max_parallel_workers = 4
oracle_user_tables_only = on
oracle_ignore_unsortable = on
column_intersection = on
difference_tie_breakers = oracle

[Initial Connection]
dsn = port=5432 dbname=live user=postgres

[BDR Connection]
node_name = node1

[Oracle Connection]
technology = oracle
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 1521
service = XE
user = LIVE
password = live

[Output Connection]
dsn = port=5432 dbname=liveoutput user=postgres

[Table Filter]
replication_sets = set_name = 'bdrgroup'
```

You also can compare a whole PGD cluster against a single Oracle database, for example:

```ini
[General Settings]
logical_replication_mode = bdr
max_parallel_workers = 4
oracle_user_tables_only = on
oracle_ignore_unsortable = on
column_intersection = on
difference_tie_breakers = oracle
all_bdr_nodes = on

[Initial Connection]
dsn = port=5432 dbname=live user=postgres

[Oracle Connection]
technology = oracle
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 1521
service = XE
user = LIVE
password = live

[Output Connection]
dsn = port=5432 dbname=liveoutput user=postgres

[Table Filter]
replication_sets = set_name = 'bdrgroup'
```

## Differences

If LiveCompare finds any difference, it generates a DML script to apply only on the PostgreSQL connections. No DML script to apply on the Oracle connection is generated.

## BLOB and CLOB data types

LiveCompare can compare CLOB fields from Oracle, provided that the equivalent field in PostgreSQL is of type `text`. The same goes for BLOB fields from Oracle. The equivalent in PostgreSQL is of type `bytea`.

However, by default, LiveCompare doesn't handle BLOB/CLOB fields if they're in the primary key or if the table has no primary key. If that's the case, then the table is ignored, and LiveCompare logs has a message like
this:

```
ORA-00932: inconsistent datatypes: expected - got BLOB
```

You can work around this behavior by telling LiveCompare to ignore BLOB/CLOB fields if the table has no primary key. Enable these two settings in the `General Settings` section:

```
oracle_ignore_unsortable = on
column_intersection = on
```

## Common hash

By default, LiveCompare has `comparison_algorithm = block_hash`, even when comparing PostgreSQL to Oracle. However, a *common hash* is built following these rules:

-   The row is fully represented as text by concatenating all column values.
-   On the Postgres side, timestamp, numeric, and bytea data types are handled to mimic Oracle.
-   This way, the full row representation is then hashed using MD5 on both sides.
-   This allows using `comparison_algorithm` set to `block_hash` and `row_hash`.
-   If there are any mismatches when using `block_hash`, LiveCompare falls back to `row_hash` and then `full_row`, as it does in a Postgres versus Postgres comparison.
-   The BLOB, CLOB, and NCLOB fields on Oracle are limited to only the first 2000 characters. `comparison_algorithm = full_row` allows comparison of the entire BLOB and CLOB.
-   On Oracle, the full row representation must not be wider than 4000 characters. If the full row representation is wider than 4000 characters, LiveCompare aborts the comparison for that specific table, and the following error message is added to the logs:

```
ORA-01489: result of string concatenation is too long
```

Later LiveCompare versions will fall back to `full_row` comparison on these specific tables. For now, a workaround is to configure a separate comparison sessions only on these tables, using `comparison_algorithm = full_row`. Using LiveCompare with Oracle 10g always requires setting `comparison_algorithm = full_row`.

The common hash uses the `standard_hash` function on Oracle 12c and later. On Oracle 11g, the `standard_hash` function isn't available, so LiveCompare tries to use the `dbms_crypto.hash` function instead. However, it might require additional privileges for the user on the Oracle side, for example:

```sql
GRANT EXECUTE ON sys.dbms_crypto TO testuser;
```
