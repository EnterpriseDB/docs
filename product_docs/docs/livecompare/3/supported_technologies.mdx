LiveCompare can connect to and compare data from a list of technologies,
including PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD, formerly known as BDR), and Oracle.

LiveCompare has three kinds of connections:

-   **Initial** (optional): Used to fetch metadata about pglogical or PGD
    connections. Required if data connections are pglogical or PGD, and if
    `replication_sets` or `node_name` settings are used. Requires
    `logical_replication_mode = pglogical` or `logical_replication_mode = bdr`. 
    A pglogical- or PGD-enabled database is required.
-   **Data**: The actual database connection that the tool connects to to perform
    data comparison. The first connection in the list is used to solve `Table
    Filter` and `Row Filter`, and is also used with the `Initial
    Connection` to gather information about PGD nodes. If
    `logical_replication_mode = bdr` and `all_bdr_nodes = on`, then LiveCompare
    considers all PGD nodes that are part of the same PGD cluster as the `Initial
    Connection`. In this case, you don't need to define data connections
    individually. The fix can be potentially applied in all data connections, as comparison
    and consensus decisions work per row.
-   **Output** (mandatory): Where LiveCompare creates a schema called
    `livecompare`, some tables, and views. This is required to keep progress and
    reporting data about comparison sessions. It must be a PostgreSQL or
    2ndQPostgres connection.

The table shows versions and details about supported technologies and the context in which you can use them in LiveCompare.

| Technology                          | Versions                               | Possible connections      |
|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|---------------------------|
| PostgreSQL                          | 10¹, 11¹, 12¹, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 | Data and output           |
| EDB Postgres Extended (PGE)         | 10¹, 11¹, 12¹, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 | Data and output           |
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) | 11¹, 12¹, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17         | Data and output           |
| pglogical                           | 2 and 3                                | Initial, data, and output |
| EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD)      | 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5                      | Initial, data, and output |
| Oracle                              | 11g, 12c, 18c, 19c, and 21c            | A single data connection  |

¹ LiveCompare only supports the use of LiveCompare with older versions of Postgres (PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Extended, or EDB Postgres Advanced Server) that have reached end of life in support of performing a major version upgrade to a newer supported version of Postgres.

!!! Note
EDB no longer tests LiveCompare with Oracle 10g. As such, it's no longer on the list of Oracle versions officially supported with LiveCompare. Oracle 10g was previously supported and is expected to continue to work in most cases. However, some limitations may exist. One known limitation is that LiveCompare requires the `comparison_algorithm` parameter to be set to `full_row` (for example, `comparison_algorithm = full_row`).

## PgBouncer support

You can use LiveCompare against nodes through PgBouncer. However, you must use
`pool_mode=session` because LiveCompare uses prepared statements on PostgreSQL,
which isn't possible when `pool_mode` is either `transaction` or
`statement`.
