After the end of execution of LiveCompare, you will notice it created a folder
called `lc_session_<session_id>` in the working directory. This folder contains
the following files:

-   `lc_<execution_mode>_<current_date>.log`: log file for the session;

-   `summary_<current_date>.out`: shows a list of all tables that were processed,
    and for each table it shows the time LiveCompare took to process the table, the
    total number of rows and how many rows were processed, how many
    differences were found in the table, and also the maximum number of ignored columns,
    if any.

To get the complete summary, you can also execute the following query against
the output database:

```postgresql
select *
from <output_schema>.vw_table_summary
where session_id = <session_id>;
```

-   `differences_<current_date>.out`: if there are any differences, this file
    shows useful information about each difference. This file is not generated if
    there are no differences.

For example, the difference list could be like this:

```text
+-------------------+-------------------------+-----------------+---------------------+
| table_name        | table_pk_column_names   |   difference_pk | difference_status   |
|-------------------+-------------------------+-----------------+---------------------|
| public.categories | category                |             (7) | P                   |
| public.categories | category                |            (10) | P                   |
| public.categories | category                |            (17) | P                   |
| public.categories | category                |            (18) | P                   |
+-------------------+-------------------------+-----------------+---------------------+
```

To get the full list of differences with all details, you can also execute the
following query against the output database:

```postgresql
select *
from <output_schema.vw_differences
where session_id = <session_id>;
```

To understand how LiveCompare consensus worked to decide which databases are
divergent, then the view `vw_consensus` can provide details on the consensus
algorithm:

```postgresql
select *
from <output_schema.vw_consensus
where session_id = <session_id>;
```

-   `apply_on_the_first_<current_date>.sql`: if there are any differences, this
    file will show a DML command to be applied on the **first** database, to make
    the **first** database consistent all other databases. For example, for the
    differences above, this script could be:

```postgresql
BEGIN;

DELETE FROM public.categories WHERE (category) = 7;
UPDATE public.categories SET categoryname = $lc1$Games Changed$lc1$ WHERE (category) = 10;
INSERT INTO public.categories (category,categoryname) VALUES (17, $lc1$Test 1$lc1$);
INSERT INTO public.categories (category,categoryname) VALUES (18, $lc1$Test 2$lc1$);

COMMIT;
```

LiveCompare generates this script automatically. In order to fix the
inconsistencies in the **first** database, you can simply execute the script in
the **first** database.

LiveCompare generates a similar `apply_on_*.sql` script for each database that
has inconsistent data.

## Comparison abortion

Before starting the comparison session, LiveCompare tries all connections. If the
number of reachable connections is not at least 2, then LiveCompare aborts the
whole session with an appropriate error message. If at least 2 connections are
reachable, then LiveCompare proceeds with the comparison session. For all
connections, LiveCompare writes a flag `connection_reachable` in the `connections`
table in the cache database.

For all reachable connections, LiveCompare does some sanity checks around the
database technologies and the setting `logical_replication_mode`. If any of the
sanity checks fail, then LiveCompare aborts the comparison with an appropriate
error message.

Considering the tables available on all reachable connections, LiveCompare builds
the list of tables to be compared, also taking into account the `Table Filter`. If
a specific table does not exist on at least 2 connections, then the comparison on
that specific table is aborted.

LiveCompare initially gathers metadata from all tables. This step is called "setup".
If any errors happen during the setup (for example) the user does not have access
to a specific table), then it's called a "setup error". If `abort_on_setup_error`
is enabled, then LiveCompare aborts the whole comparison session and the program
finishes with an error message. Otherwise, only the specific table having the error
has its table comparison aborted and LiveCompare moves on to the next table.

For each table LiveCompare starts the table comparison, first LiveCompare checks
the table definition on all reachable connections. If the tables don't have the
same columns and column data types, LiveCompare applies the `column_intersection`.
If there are no columns to compare, then LiveCompare aborts the table comparison.

## Comparison Key

For each table being compared, when gathering the table metadata, LiveCompare
builds the `Comparison Key` to be used in the table comparison, following these
rules:

1- Use the custom `Comparison Key` if the user configured it; or

2- Use PK if available; or

3- If the table has `UNIQUE` indexes: among the `UNIQUE` indexes that have all
`NOT NULL` columns, use the `UNIQUE` index with less columns; or

4- If none of the above is possible, try to use all `NOT NULL` columns as a
Comparison Key (`NULL` columns can also be considered if `ignore_nullable = false`).

If stratgies 1 or 4 above are decided to be used as a Comparison Key, then
LiveCompare also checks for uniqueness on the key. If uniqueness is not possible,
then LiveCompare aborts the comparison on that specific table (this behavior can be
disabled with `check_uniqueness_enforcement = false`).

## Which differences to fix

LiveCompare is able to identify and provide fixes for the following differences:

-   A row exists in the majority of the data connections. The fix will be an
    `INSERT` on the divergent databases;
-   A row does not exist in the majority of the data connections. The fix will be
    a `DELETE` on the divergent databases;
-   A row exists in all databases, but some column values mismatch. The fix will
    be an `UPDATE` on the divergent databases.

By default `difference_statements = all`, which means that LiveCompare will try
to apply all 3 DML types (`INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE`) for each difference
it finds. But it is possible to specify which type of DML LiveCompare should
consider when providing difference fixes, by changing the value of
the setting `difference_statements`, which can be:

-   `all` (default): Fixes `INSERT`s, `UPDATE`s and `DELETE`s;
-   `inserts`: Fixes only `INSERT`s;
-   `updates`: Fixes only `UPDATE`s;
-   `deletes`: Fixes only `DELETE`s;
-   `inserts_updates`: Fixes only `INSERT`s and `UPDATE`s;
-   `inserts_deletes`: Fixes only `INSERT`s and `DELETE`s;
-   `updates_deletes`: Fixes only `UPDATE`s and `DELETE`s.

When `difference_statements` has the values `all`, `updates`, `inserts_updates`
or `updates_deletes`, then it is possible to tell LiveCompare to ignore any
`UPDATE`s that would set `NULL` to a column.

## Difference log

Table `difference_log` stores all information about differences every time
LiveCompare checked them. Users can run LiveCompare in re-check mode multiple
times, so this table shows how the difference has evolved over the time window
where LiveCompare was re-checking it.

-   **Detected (D)**: The difference was just detected. In re-check and fix modes,
    LiveCompare will mark all Permanent and Tie differences as Detected in order to
    re-check them.

-   **Permanent (P)**: After having re-checked the difference, if data is still
    divergent, LiveCompare marks the difference as **Permanent**.

-   **Tie (T)**: Same as Permanent, but there is not enough consensus to determine
    which connections are the majority.

-   **Absent (A)**: If upon a re-check LiveCompare finds that the difference does
    not exist anymore (the row is now consistent between both databases), then
    LiveCompare marks the difference as **Absent**.

-   **Volatile (V)**: If upon a re-check `xmin` has changed on an inconsistent
    row, then LiveCompare marks the difference as **Volatile**.

-   **Ignored (I)**: Users can stop difference re-check of certain differences by
    manually calling the function
    `<livecompare_schema_name>.accept_divergence(session_id, table_name, difference_pk)`
    in the Output PostgreSQL connection. For example:

```postgresql
SELECT livecompare.accept_divergence(
    2                   -- session_id
  , 'public.categories' -- table_name
  , $$(10)$$            -- difference_pk
);
```
