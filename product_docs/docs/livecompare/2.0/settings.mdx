## General Settings

-   `logical_replication_mode`: Affects how the program interprets connections and
    table filter settings (see more details below), and also what requirements to
    check for in the connections before starting the comparison. Currently the
    possible values are:

    ```
    - `off`: Assumes there is no logical replication between the databases;

    - `native`: Assumes there is native logical replication between the
    databases. Enables the usage of the `Table Filter -> publications`
    setting to specify the list of tables to be used. Requires PostgreSQL 10+ on
    all databases.

    - `pglogical`: Assumes there is pglogical replication between the databases.
    Enables the usage of the `Table Filter -> replication_sets` setting to
    specify the list of tables to be used. Also enables the usage of `node_name`
    to specify the data connections, which require setting the `Initial
    Connection` that is used to retrieve DSN information of the nodes. Requires
    the `pglogical` extensions to be installed on all databases.

    - `bdr`: Assumes all data connections are nodes from the same BDR cluster.
    Enables usage of `Table Filter -> replication_sets` setting to specify list
    of tables to be used. Also enables usage of `node_name` to
    specify the data connections, which require setting `Initial Connection`
    that is used to retrieve DSN information of the nodes. Requires `pglogical`
    and `bdr` extensions installed on all databases.
    ```

-   `all_bdr_nodes`: If `logical_replication_mode` is set to `bdr`, then it is
    possible to specify only the Initial Connection (see below) and let LiveCompare
    build the connection list based on the current list of active BDR nodes.
    Default: `off`.

-   `max_parallel_workers`: Number of parallel processes to be considered. Each
    process will work on a table from the queue. Default: `2`.

**Important**: Each process will keep N+1 open connections: 1 to each data
connection and another 1 to the output database.

-   `buffer_size`: Number of rows to be retrieved from the tables on every data
    fetch operation. Default: `4096`.

-   `log_level`: Verbosity level in the log file. Possible values: `debug`,
    `info`, `warning` or `error`. Default: `info`.

-   `data_fetch_mode`: Affects how LiveCompare fetches data from the database.

    -   `prepared_statements`: Uses prepared statements (a query with `LIMIT`) for
        data fetch. Only a very small amount of data (`buffer_size = 4096` rows by
        default) is fetched each time, so it has the smallest impact of all 3 modes,
        and by the same reason it's the safer fetch mode. Allows asynchronous data
        fetch (defined by `parallel_data_fetch`). For the general use case, this
        fetch method provides a good performance, but a performance decrease can be
        felt for large tables. This is the default and strongly recommended when
        server load is medium-high.

    -   `server_side_cursors_with_hold`: Uses server-side cursors `WITH HOLD` for
        data fetch. As table data is retrieved in a single transaction, it holds
        back `xmin` and can cause bloat and replication issues, and also prevent
        `VACUUM` from running well. Also, the `WITH HOLD` clause tells Postgres to
        materialize the query (workers may hang for a few seconds waiting for the
        data to be materialized), so the whole table data consumes RAM and can be
        stored on Postgres side disk as temporary files. All that impact can be
        decreased by using `parallel_chunk_rows` (set to 10000000 by default), and
        speed can be improved by increasing `buffer_size` a little. Allows
        asynchronous data fetch (defined by `parallel_data_fetch`). For the general
        use case, this fetch method doesn't provide any benefits when compared to
        `prepared_stataments`, but for multiple small tables it's faster. However,
        this mode is recommended only when load is very low, for example on tests
        and migration scenarios.

    -   `server_side_cursors_without_hold`: Uses server-side cursors
        `WITHOUT HOLD` for data fetch. As `server_side_cursors_with_hold`, this
        mode can also hold back `xmin`, thus potentially can cause bloat, `VACUUM`
        and replication issues on Postgres, but such impact is higher because
        `WITHOUT HOLD` cursors require an open transaction for the whole comparison
        session (this will be lifted in further versions). As the snapshot is held
        for the whole comparison session, comparison results might be helpful
        depending on your use case. As the query is not materialized, memory usage
        and temp file generation remains low. Asynchronous data fetch is not
        allowed. In terms of performance, this mode is slower for the general use
        case, but for large tables it can be the faster. It's recommended when load
        on the database is low-medium.

**Important**: the choice of the right `data_fetch_mode` for the right scenario
is very important. Using prepared statements has the smallest footprint on the
database server, so it's the safest approach, and it's good for the general use
case. Another point is that prepared statements allow LiveCompare to always see
the latest version of the rows, which may not happen when using server-side
cursors on a busy database. So it's recommended to use `prepared_statements` for
production, high load servers; and either `server_side_cursors_*` settings for
testing, migration scenarios, and low load servers. The best strategy would
probably mix `server_side_cursors_without_hold` for very large tables, and
`prepared_statements` for the remaining tables. Refer to the table below for
a comparison on the cost/benefit ratio:

|                    | prepared_statements | server_side_cursors_with_hold | server_side_cursors_without_hold |
| ------------------ | :-----------------: | :---------------------------: | :------------------------------: |
| xmin hold          |       very low      |             medium            |               high               |
| xmin released per  |        buffer       |             chunk             |     whole comparison session     |
| temp files         |       very low      |           very high           |                low               |
| memory             |       very low      |              high             |                low               |
| allows async conns |         yes         |              yes              |                no                |
| fastest for        |       general       |          small tables         |           large tables           |
| recommended load   |         high        |            very low           |            low-medium            |

**Note about Oracle**: For Oracle, the `data_fetch_mode` setting is completely
ignored, and data will always be fetch from Oracle using direct queries with
`LIMIT`, without using prepared statements or cursors.

-   `parallel_chunk_rows`: Minimum number of rows required to consider splitting a
    table into multiple chunks for parallel comparison. A hash is used to fetch
    data, so workers don't clash with each other. Each table chunk will have no more
    than `parallel_chunk_rows` rows. Setting it to any value &lt; 1 disables table
    splitting. If any connections are not PostgreSQL, then table splitting is
    disabled automatically by LiveCompare. Default: 10000000.

-   `parallel_data_fetch`: If data fetch should be performed in parallel (i.e.,
    using async connections to the databases). Improves performance of multi-way
    comparison. If any data connections are not PostgreSQL, then this setting is
    automatically disabled. It's only allowed when
    `data_fetch_mode = prepared_statements` or
    `data_fetch_mode = server_side_cursors_with_hold`.
    Default: `on`.

-   `comparison_algorithm`: Affects how LiveCompare works through table rows to
    compare data. Using hashes is faster than full row comparison. It can assume one
    of the following values:

    ```
    - `full_row`: Disables row comparison using hashes. Full comparison, in this
    case, is  performed by comparing the row column by column.

    - `row_hash`: Enables row comparison using hashes and enables table
    splitting. Tables are split so each worker compares a maximum of
    `parallel_chunk_rows` per table. Data row is hashed in PostgreSQL, so the
    comparison is faster than `full_row`. However, if for a specific row the
    hash does not match, then for that specific row, LiveCompare will fallback
    to `full_row` algorithm (i.e., compare row by row). If any data connections
    is not PostgreSQL, then LiveCompare uses a row hash that's defined as the MD5
    hash of the concatenated column values of the row, being considered a
    "common hash" among the database technologies being compared.

    - `block_hash`: Works the same as `row_hash`, but instead of comparing row
    by row, LiveCompare builds a "block hash", i.e., a hash of the hashes of all
    rows in the data buffer that was just fetched (maximum of `buffer_size`
    rows). Conceptually it works like a 2-level Merkle Tree. If the block hash
    matches, then LiveCompare advances the whole block (this is why this
    comparison algorithm is faster than `row_hash`). If block hash does not
    match, then LiveCompare falls back to `row_hash` and performs comparison row
    by row in the buffer to find the divergent rows. This is the default value.
    ```

-   `min_time_between_round_saves`: Time in seconds to wait before updating each
    round state when the comparison algorithm is in progress. Note that when the
    round finishes, LiveCompare always updates the round state for that table.
    Default: 60 seconds.

**Important**: If the user cancels execution of LiveCompare by hitting `Ctrl-c`
and starts it again, then LiveCompare will resume the round for that table,
starting from the point where the round state was saved.

-   `stop_after_time`: Time in seconds after which LiveCompare will automatically
    stop itself as if the user had hit `Ctrl-c`. The comparison session that was
    interrupted, if not finished yet, can be resumed again by passing the session
    ID as argument in the command line. Default is `stop_after_time = 0`, which
    means that automatic interruption is disabled.

-   `consensus_mode`: Consensus algorithm used by LiveCompare to determine which
    data connections are divergent. Possible values are `simple_majority`,
    `quorum_based` or `source_of_truth`. If `consensus_mode = source_of_truth` then
    `difference_sources_of_truth` must be filled. Default is `simple_majority`.

-   `difference_required_quorum`: If `consensus_mode = quorum_based`, then this
    setting specified the minimum quorum is required to decide which connections are
    divergent. Should be a number between 0.0 and 1.0 (0.0 means no connection is
    required while 1.0 means all connections are required, both cases are extreme
    and should not be used). The default value is 0.5, and we recommend using a
    value close to that.

-   `difference_sources_of_truth`: Comma-separated list of connections names (or
    node names, if `logical_replication_mode = bdr` and `all_bdr_nodes = on`) that
    should be considered as source of truth. It is only used when `consensus_mode =
    source_of_truth`. For example: `difference_sources_of_truth = node1,node2`. In
    this example, either the sections `node1 Connection` and `node2 Connection`
    should be defined in the .ini file or `all_bdr_nodes = on` and only the `Initial
    Connection` is defined, while `node1` and `node2` should be valid BDR node
    names.

-   `difference_tie_breakers`: Comma-separated list of connection names (or node
    names, if `logical_replication_mode = bdr` and `all_bdr_nodes = on`) that should
    be considered as tie breakers whenever the consensus algorithm finds a tie
    situation. For example: `difference_tie_breakers = node1,node2`. In this
    example, either the sections `node1 Connection` and `node2 Connections` should
    be defined in the .ini file or `all_bdr_nodes = on` and only the `Initial
    Connection` is defined, while `node1` and `node2` should be valid BDR node
     names. Default is to not consider any connection as tie breaker.

-   `difference_statements`: Controls what kind of DML statements will be
    generated by LiveCompare. The value of `difference_statements` can
    be one of:

    ```
    - `all` (default)
    - `inserts`
    - `updates`
    - `deletes`
    - `inserts_updates`
    - `inserts_deletes`
    - `updates_deletes`
    ```

-   `difference_allow_null_updates`: Determines whether commands like `UPDATE SET
    col = NULL` will be allowed in the difference report. Default:
    `on`.

-   `difference_statement_order`: Controls order of DML statements that will be
    generated by LiveCompare. The value of `difference_statement_order`
    can be one of:

    ```
    - `delete_insert_update`
    - `delete_update_insert` (default)
    - `insert_update_delete`
    - `insert_delete_update`
    - `update_insert_delete`
    - `update_delete_insert`
    ```

-   `difference_fix_replication_origin`: When working with BDR databases, for
    difference LiveCompare will create a specific replication origin if it doesn't
    exist yet, then use the replication origin to create apply script with DML
    fixes.  The setting `difference_fix_replication_origin` specifies the name of
    the replication origin used by LiveCompare. If the user doesn't set any value
    for this setting, then LiveCompare will automatically set
    `difference_fix_replication_origin = bdr_local_only_origin`. Note that the
    replication origin that LiveCompare creates is not dropped to allow verification
    after the comparison, but if needed the replication origin can be manually
    dropped later. Requires `logical_replication_mode = bdr`.

**IMPORTANT**: Please note that BDR 3.6.18 introduced the new pre-created
`bdr_local_only_origin` replication origin to be used for applying local-only
transactions. So if LiveCompare is connected to BDR 3.6.18, it won't create this
replication origin, and it is recommended that the user should not try to drop
this replication origin.

-   `difference_fix_start_query`: Arbitrary query that is executed at the
    beginning of the apply script generated by LiveCompare. Additionally if a BDR comparison
    is being performed and the `difference_fix_start_query` is empty, then
    LiveCompare also automatically does the following:

    ```
    - If the divergent connection is BDR 3.6.7, add
    `SET LOCAL bdr.xact_replication = off;`
    - Add commands that setup transaction to use the replication origin
    specified in `difference_fix_replication_origin`.
    ```

-   `show_progress_bars`: Determines whether or not progress bars should be shown
    in the console output. Disabling this setting might be useful for batch
    executions. Default: `on`.

-   `output_schema`: In the output connection, the schema where the comparison
    report tables will be created. Default: `livecompare`.

-   `hash_column_name`: Every data fetch will contain a specific column which is
    the hash of all actual columns in the row. This setting specifies the name of
    this column. Default: `livecompare_hash`.

-   `rownumber_column_name`: Some fetches need to use the `row_number()` function
    value inside a query column. This setting specifies the name of this column.
    Default: `livecompare_rownumber`.

-   `fetch_row_origin`: When this setting is enabled, LiveCompare fetches the
    origin name for each divergent row, which might be useful for debugging
    purposes. Default: `off`. To be enabled, requires `logical_replication_mode` set
    to `pglogical` or `bdr`.

-   `column_intersection`: When this setting is enabled, for a given table that is
    being compared, LiveCompare will only work on the intersection of columns from
    the table on all connections, ignoring extra columns that might exist on any of
    the connections. When this setting is disabled, LiveCompare will check if
    columns are equivalent on the table on all connections, and abort the comparison
    of the table if there are any column mismatches. Default: `off`.

**Important**: If table has PK, then the PK columns are not allowed to be
different, even if `column_intersection = on`.

-   `oracle_ignore_unsortable`: When enabled, tells LiveCompare to ignore columns
    with Oracle unsortable data types (BLOB, CLOB, NCLOB, BFILE) if column is not
    part of the table PK. If enabling this setting, it is recommended to also enable
    `column_intersection`.

-   `oracle_user_tables_only`: When enabled, tells LiveCompare to fetch table
    metadata only from the Oracle logged in user, which is faster because it reads,
    for example, from `sys.user_tables` and `sys.user_tab_columns` instead of
    `sys.all_tables` and `sys.all_tab_columns`. Default: `off`.

-   `oracle_fetch_fk_metadata`: When enabled, tells LiveCompare to fetch foreign
    key metadata, which can be a slow operation. Overrides the value of the setting
    `fetch_fk_metadata` on the Oracle connection. Default: `off`.

-   `schema_qualified_table_names`: Table names are treated as schema-qualified
    when this setting is enabled. Disabling it allows comparison of tables without
    using schema-qualified table names: on Oracle x Postgres comparisons, it
    requires also enabling `oracle_user_tables_only`, while on Postgres x Postgres,
    it allows for comparisons of tables that are under different schemas, even in
    the same database. Also, when `schema_qualified_table_names` is enabled,
    `Table Filter -> tables`, `Row Filter` and `Column Filter` allow table name
    without the schema name. Default: `on`.

-   `force_collate`: When set to a value other than `off` and to a valid collation
    name, forces the specified collation name in `ORDER BY` operations in all
    Postgres databases being compared. Useful when comparing Postgres databases with
    different collation or when comparing Oracle versus Postgres databases (in this
    case users should set `force_collate = C`). Will assume value `C` if comparing
    mixed technologies (like Oracle vs PostgreSQL) and no collation is specified.
    Default: `off`.

-   `work_directory`: path to the `LiveCompare` working directory. The session
    folder containing output files will be created in such directory. Default:
    `.` (current directory).

-   `abort_on_setup_error`: when enabled, if LiveCompare hits any error when
    trying to setup a table comparison round, the whole comparison session is
    aborted. Default: `off`.

**Important**: Setting `abort_on_setup_error` is only considered during
`compare` mode. In `recheck` mode, LiveCompare always aborts at the first error
in setup.

-   `custom_dollar_quoting_delimiter`: when LiveCompare finds differences, it will
    output the DML using dollar quoting on strings. The default behavior is create
    a random string to compose it. If you want by any means use a custom one, you
    can set this parameter as the delimiter to be used. You just need to set the
    constant, not the `$` symbols around the constant. Defaults to `off`, which
    means LiveCompare will use a `md5` hash of the word `LiveCompare`.

-   `session_replication_role_replica`: when enabled LiveCompare will use
    `session_replication_role` PostgreSQL setting  as `replica` in the output apply
    scripts. That's useful if you want to prevent firing triggers and rules while
    applying DML in the nodes with divergences. Enabling it requires a PostgreSQL
    super user, otherwise will take no effect. Defaults to `off`.

-   `split_updates`: when enabled LiveCompare will split `UPDATE` divergences,
    i.e., instead of generating a `UPDATE` DML,  it will generate corresponding
    `DELETE` and `INSERT` in the apply script. Defaults to `off`.

-   `float_point_round`: an integer to specify decimal digits that LiveCompare
    should round when comparing float point values coming from the database. Default
    is -1, which disables float point rounding.

## Initial Connection

The initial connection is used only when `logical_replication_mode` is set to
`pglogical` or `bdr`, and is used only when the program starts, to fetch DSN
from node names, if the user has set data connections using only the `node_name`
setting.

-   `technology`: RDBMS technology. Currently the only possible value is
    `postgresql`.
-   `dsn`: PostgreSQL connection string. If `dsn` is set, then `host`, `port`,
    `dbname` and `user` are ignored. The `dsn` setting can also have all other
    [parameter key words allowed by libpq](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS).
-   `host`: Server address. Leave empty to use the Unix socket connection.
-   `port`: Port. Default: `5432`.
-   `dbname`: Database name. Default: `postgres`.
-   `user`: Database user. Default: `postgres`.
-   `application_name`. Application name. Can be used even if the user set `dsn`
    instead of all other connection information. Default: `livecompare_initial`.

## Output Connection

The output connection specifies where LiveCompare will create the comparison
report tables.

-   `technology`: RDBMS technology. Currently the only possible value is
    `postgresql`.
-   `dsn`: PostgreSQL connection string. If `dsn` is set, then `host`, `port`,
    `dbname` and `user` are ignored. The `dsn` setting can also have all other
    [parameter key words allowed by libpq](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS).
-   `host`: Server address. Leave empty to use the Unix socket connection.
-   `port`: Port. Default: `5432`.
-   `dbname`: Database name. Default: `postgres`.
-   `user`: Database user. Default: `postgres`.
-   `application_name`. Application name. Can be used even if the user set `dsn`
    instead of all other connection information. Default: `livecompare_output`.

## Data Connection

A "data connection" is a connection section similar to the `Initial Connection`
and the `Output Connection`, but LiveCompare effectively fetches and compares
data on the data connections.

Similarly to the `Initial Connection` and `Output Connection`, a "data
connection" is defined in a named section. The section name should be of the
form `Name Connection`, being `Name` any single-worded string starting with an
alphabetic character. In this case, whatever the user fills in `Name` is called
the "Connection ID" of the data connection. It is also required that each data
connection has an unique Connection ID in the whole list of data connections.

If `logical_replication_mode = bdr` and `all_bdr_nodes = on`, then the user is
not required to specify any data connection, because LiveCompare will build the
data connection list by fetching BDR metadata from the `Initial Connection`.

-   `technology`: RDBMS technology. Currently possible values are `postgresql` or
    `oracle`.
-   `node_name`: Name of the node in the cluster. Requires
    `logical_replication_mode` set to `pglogical` or `bdr`, and also requires that
    the `Initial Connection` is filled. If `node_name` is set, then `dsn`, `host`
    `port`, `dbname` and `user` settings are all ignored.
-   `dsn`: PostgreSQL connection string. If `dsn` is set, then `host`, `port`,
    `dbname` and `user` are ignored. The `dsn` setting can also have all other
    [parameter key words allowed by libpq](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-PARAMKEYWORDS).
-   `host`: Server address. Leave empty to use the Unix socket connection.
-   `port`: Port. Default: `5432`.
-   `dbname`: Database name. Default: `postgres`.
-   `service`: Service name, used in Oracle connections. Default: `XE`.
-   `user`: Database user. Default: `postgres`.
-   `password`: Plain text password. We recommend not to use this, but in some
    legacy connections it might be required.
-   `application_name`. Application name. Can be used even if the user set `dsn`
    or `node_name` instead of all other connection information. Default:
    `livecompare_<Connection ID>`.
-   `start_query`: Arbitrary query that is executed each time a connection to a
    database is open.
-   `fetch_fk_metadata`: If LiveCompare should gather metadata about foreign keys
    on the connection. Default: `on`.

## Table Filter

If omitted or left empty, this section from the `.ini` file will mean that
LiveCompare should be executed against **all** tables in the **first** database.

If you want LiveCompare to be executed against a specific set of tables, there
are different ways to specify this:

-   `publications`: You can filter specific publications, and LiveCompare will use
    only the tables associated to those publications. The variable
    `publication_name` can be used to build the conditional expression, for example:

```ini
publications = publication_name = 'livepub'
```

Requires `logical_replication_mode = native`.

-   `replication_sets`: When using pglogical or BDR, you can filter specific
    replication sets, and LiveCompare will work only on the tables associated to
    those replication sets. The variable `set_name` can be used to build the
    conditional expression, for example:

```ini
replication_sets = set_name in ('default', 'bdrgroup')
```

Requires `logical_replication_mode = pglogical` or
`logical_replication_mode = bdr`.

-   `schemas`: You can filter specific schemas, and LiveCompare will work only on
    the tables that belong to those schemas. The variable `schema_name` can be used
    to build the conditional expression, for example:

```ini
schemas = schema_name != 'badschema'
```

-   `tables`: The variable `table_name` can help you build a conditional
    expression to filter only the tables you want LiveCompare to work on, for
    example:

```ini
tables = table_name not like '%%account'
```

Please note that, in any conditional expression, the `%` character should be
escaped as `%%`.

The table name should be schema-qualified, unless `schema_qualified_table_names`
is disabled. For example, it's possible to filter only a specific list of
tables:

```
tables = table_name in ('myschema1.mytable1', 'myschema2.mytable2')
```

If you have disabled general setting `schema_qualified_table_names`, then you
should also set an appropriate `search_path` for Postgres in the connection
`start_query` setting, for example:

```
[General Setting]
...
schema_qualified_table_names = off

[My Connection]
...
start_query = SET search_path TO myschema1, myschema2

[Table Filter]
tables = table_name in ('mytable1', 'mytable2')
```

**IMPORTANT**: Please note that if two or more schemas that were set on `search_path`
contains a table if the same name, just the first one found will be considered
in the comparison.

The `Table Filter` section can have a mix of `publications`, `replication_sets`,
`schemas` and `tables` filters, and LiveCompare will consider the set of tables
that are in the intersection of all filters you specified. For example:

```ini
[Table Filter]
publications = publication_name = 'livepub'
replication_sets = set_name in ('default', 'bdrgroup')
schemas = schema_name != 'badschema'
tables = table_name not like '%%account'
```

Also please note that the table filter is applied in the first database, to
build the table list. If a table exists in the first database and is being
considered in the filter, but does not exist in any other database, then you
will see something like this in the logs, and the comparison for that specific
table will be skipped.

```text
2019-06-17 11:52:41,403 - ERROR - live_table.py - 55 - GetMetaData - P1: livecompare_second_1: Table public.test does not exist
2019-06-17 11:52:41,410 - ERROR - live_round.py - 201 - Initialize - P1: Table public.test does not exist on second connection. Aborting comparison
```

Similarly, if a table exists in any other database but does not exist in the
first database, then it won't be considered in the comparison, even if you
didn't apply any table filter.

A comparison for a specific table will also be skipped if the table column names
are not exactly the same (unless `column_intersection` is enabled), and in the
same order. An appropriate message will be included in the log file as well.

Currently LiveCompare does not check if data types nor constraints are the same
on both tables.

**IMPORTANT**: please note that `conflicts` mode doesn't make use of table filter.

## Row Filter

In this section you can apply a row-level filter to any table, so LiveCompare
will work only on the rows that satisfy the row filter.

You can write a list of tables under this section, one table per line (all
table names should be schema qualified unless `schema_qualified_table_names` is
disabled), for example:

```ini
[Row Filter]
public.table1 = id = 10
public.table2 = logdate >= '2000-01-01'
```

In this case, for the table `public.table1`, LiveCompare will work only in the
rows that satisfy the clause `id = 10`, while for the table `public.table2`,
only rows that satisfy `logdate >= '2000-01-01` will be considered in the
comparison.

If you have disabled general setting `schema_qualified_table_names`, then you
should also set an appropriate `search_path` for Postgres in the connection
`start_query` setting, for example:

```
[General Setting]
...
schema_qualified_table_names = off

[My Connection]
...
start_query = SET search_path TO public

[Row Filter]
table1 = id = 10
table2 = logdate >= '2000-01-01'
```

Any kind of SQL condition (same as you would put in the `WHERE` clause) is
accepted, in the same line, as the table row filter. For example, if you have a
large table and want to compare only a specific number of IDs, it's possible to
create a temporary table with all the IDs. Then you can use an `IN` clause to
emulate a `JOIN`, like this:  

```
[Row Filter]
public.large_table = id IN (SELECT id2 FROM temp_table)
```

If a row filter is written incorrectly, then LiveCompare will try to apply the
filter but will fail. So the comparison for this specific table will be skipped,
and an exception will be written to the log file.

If a table is listed in the `Row Filter` section, but somehow got filtered out
by the `Table Filter`, then the row filter for this table will be silently
ignored.

**IMPORTANT**: please note that `conflicts` mode doesn't make use of row filter.

## Column Filter

In this section you can apply a column-level filter to any table, so LiveCompare
will work only on the columns that are not part of the column filter.

You can write a list of tables under this section, one table per line (all
table names should be schema qualified unless `schema_qualified_table_names` is
disabled). For example, considering both `public.table1` and `public.table2` have
the columns `column1`, `column2`, `column3`, `column4` and `column5`:

```ini
[Column Filter]
public.table1 = column1, column3
public.table2 = column1, column5
```

In this case, for the table `public.table1`, LiveCompare will work only in the
columns `column2`, `column4` and `column5`, filtering out `column1` and `column3`,
while for the table `public.table2`, only the columns `column2`, `column3` and
`column4` will be considered in the comparison, filtering out `column1` and `column5`.

If you have disabled general setting `schema_qualified_table_names`, then you
should also set an appropriate `search_path` for Postgres in the connection
`start_query` setting, for example:

```
[General Setting]
...
schema_qualified_table_names = off

[My Connection]
...
start_query = SET search_path TO public

[Column Filter]
table1 = column1, column3
table2 = column1, column5
```

If absent column names are given in the column filter, that is, column doesn't
exist in  the given table, then LiveCompare will log a message about the columns
that could not be found and ignore them, using just the valid ones, if any.

If a table is listed in the `Column Filter` section, but somehow got filtered
out  by the `Table Filter`, then the column filter for this table will be
silently  ignored.

**IMPORTANT**: Please note that if a column specified in a `Column Filter` is
part of  the table PK, then it won't be ignored in the comparison. LiveCompare
will log that and  ignore the filter of such column.

**IMPORTANT**: please note that `conflicts` mode doesn't make use of column filter.

## Conflicts Filter

In this section you can specify a filter to be used in `--conflicts` mode while
fetching conflicts from BDR nodes. You can build any SQL conditional expression,
and use below fields in the expression:

-   `origin_node`: the upstream node of the subscription
-   `target_node`: the downstream node of the subscription
-   `local_time`: the timestamp when the conflict occurred in the node
-   `conflict_type`: the type of the conflict
-   `conflict_resolution`: the resolution which was applied
-   `nspname`: schema name of the involved relation
-   `relname`: relation name of the involved relation

You must use `conflicts` attribute under the section. Please find an example below:

```
[Conflicts Filter]
conflicts = conflict_type = 'update_missing' AND nspname = 'my_schema'
```

By adding above piece of configuration to your INI file, LiveCompare would fetch
just conflicts that are of type `update_missing`, and related to tables under
schema `my_schema` while querying for conflicts in each of the BDR nodes.

**IMPORTANT**: Please note that this section is exclusive for `--conflicts` mode.
