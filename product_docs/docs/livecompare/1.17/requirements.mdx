LiveCompare requires:

-   Python >= 3.6 and &lt;= 3.8
-   PostgreSQL / EDB Postgres Extended 9.5+ / EPAS 11+ (on the output connection)
-   PostgreSQL / EDB Postgres Extended 9.4+ / EPAS 11+ or Oracle 10g+ (on the data connections being compared)

LiveCompare requires at least Debian 10, Ubuntu 16.04, or CentOS/RHEL 7.

LiveCompare can be installed from the EnterpriseDB `products/livecompare`
repository. More details can be found in:

<https://techsupport.enterprisedb.com/customer_portal/sw/livecompare/>

LiveCompare installs on top of:

-   The latest Python version for Ubuntu, Debian and CentOS/RHEL 8, as provided by
    the `python3` packages; or
-   Python 3.6 for CentOS/RHEL 7, as provided by the `python-36` packages.

On CentOS/RHEL distributions, LiveCompare also requires the EPEL repository.
More details can be found in:

<https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>

Specifically on CentOS/RHEL version 7, the Python component `tqdm` is too old
(&lt; 4.16.0). It is possible to install the latest `tqdm` using `pip` or `pip3`
for the user that is running LiveCompare:

```
pip install --user tqdm --upgrade
```

## LiveCompare with TPAexec

The following sample config for `TPAexec` can be used to build a server with
