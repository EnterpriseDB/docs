LiveCompare can be used against BDR nodes, as well as non-BDR nodes.

Setting `logical_replication_mode = bdr` will make the tool assume that all
databases being compared belong to the same BDR cluster. Then you can specify
node names as connections, and replication sets to filter tables.

For example, consider you are able to connect to any node in the BDR cluster.
Let's call this `Initial Connection`. By initially connection to this node,
LiveCompare is able to check BDR metadata and retrieve connection information
from all other nodes.

Now consider you want to compare 3 BDR nodes. As LiveCompare is able to connect
to any node starting from the `Initial Connection`, you do not need to define
`dsn` or any connection information for the data connections. You just need to
define `node_name`. LiveCompare searches in BDR metadata about the connection
information for that node, and then connects to the node.

Please note that, for LiveCompare to be able to connect to all other nodes by
fetching BDR metadata, it is required that LiveCompare is able to connect to
them using the same DSN from BDR view `bdr.node_summary`, field
`interface_connstr`. In this case it is recommended to run LiveCompare on the
same machine as the `Initial Connection`, as `postgres` user. If that's not
possible, then please define the `dsn` attribute in all data connections.

You can also specify replication sets as table filters. LiveCompare will use
BDR metadata to build the table list, considering only tables that belong to the
replication set(s) you defined in the `replication_sets` setting.

For example, you can create an `.ini` file to compare 3 BDR nodes:

```ini
[General Settings]
logical_replication_mode = bdr
max_parallel_workers = 4
parallel_chunk_rows = 1000000

[Initial Connection]
dsn = port=5432 dbname=live user=postgres

[Node1 Connection]
node_name = node1

[Node2 Connection]
node_name = node2

[Node3 Connection]
node_name = node3

[Output Connection]
dsn = port=5432 dbname=liveoutput user=postgres

[Table Filter]
replication_sets = set_name = 'bdrgroup'
```

It is also possible to tell LiveCompare to compare all active nodes in the BDR
cluster. For that purpose just do the following:

-   In `General Settings`, enable `all_bdr_nodes = on`;
-   Specify an `Initial Connection`;
-   Additional data connections are not required.

For example:

```ini
[General Settings]
logical_replication_mode = bdr
max_parallel_workers = 4
parallel_chunk_rows = 1000000
all_bdr_nodes = on

[Initial Connection]
dsn = port=5432 dbname=live user=postgres

[Output Connection]
dsn = port=5432 dbname=liveoutput user=postgres

[Table Filter]
replication_sets = set_name = 'bdrgroup'
```

When `all_bdr_nodes = on`, LiveCompare uses the `Initial Connection` to fetch
the list of all BDR nodes. Additional data connections are not required;
although if set, will be appended to the list of data connections. For example,
it would be possible to compare a whole BDR cluster against a single Postgres
connection, useful in migration projects:

```ini
[General Settings]
logical_replication_mode = bdr
max_parallel_workers = 4
parallel_chunk_rows = 1000000
all_bdr_nodes = on

[Initial Connection]
dsn = port=5432 dbname=live user=postgres

[Old Connection]
dsn = host=oldpg port=5432 dbname=live user=postgres

[Output Connection]
dsn = port=5432 dbname=liveoutput user=postgres

[Table Filter]
replication_sets = set_name = 'bdrgroup'
```

Settings `node_name` and `replication_sets` are supported for the following
technologies:

-   BDR 1, 2 and 3;
-   pglogical 2 and 3.

Please note that to enable pglogical metadata fetch instead of BDR, just set
`logical_replication_mode = pglogical` instead of
`logical_replication_mode = bdr`.

## BDR Witness nodes

Using replication sets in BDR, it's possible to configure specific tables to be
included in the BDR replication, and also specify which nodes should receive
data from such tables, by configuring the node to subscribe to the replication
set the table belongs to. This allows for different architectures such as BDR
Sharding and the use of BDR Witness nodes.

A BDR Witness is a regular BDR node which doesn't replicate any DML from other
nodes. The purpose of the Witness is to provide quorum in Raft Consensus voting
(for more details on the BDR Witness node, check BDR documentation). Depending
on how replication sets were configured, the Witness may or may not replicate
DDL. Which means that there are 2 types of BDR Witnesses:

-   A completely empty node, without any data nor tables; or
-   A node that replicates DDL from other nodes, hence having empty tables.

In the first case, even if the BDR Witness is included in the comparison (either
manually under `[Connections]` or using `all_bdr_nodes = on`), as the Witness
doesn't have any tables, the following message will be logged:

```
Table public.tbl does not exist on connection node1
```

In the second case, on the other hand, the table exists on the BDR Witness.
However, it would not be correct to report data missing on the Witness as
divergences. So, for each table, LiveCompare checks the following information on
each node included in the comparison:

-   The replication sets that the node subscribes;
-   The replication sets that the table is associated with;
-   The replication sets, if any, the user defined in filter `replication_sets`
    under `Table Filter`.

If the intersection among all 3 lists of replication sets is empty, which is the
case for the BDR Witness, then LiveCompare will log this:

```
Table public.tbl is not subscribed on connection node1
```

In both cases, the comparison for that specific table proceeds on the nodes
where the table exists, and the table is replicated according to the replication
sets configuration.

## Differences in a BDR cluster

LiveCompare will make changes to the local node only; it is important that
corrective changes do not get replicated to other nodes.

When `logical_replication_mode = bdr`, LiveCompare will initially check if a
replication origin called `bdr_local_only_origin` already exists (the name of
the replication origin can be configured by adjusting the setting
`difference_fix_replication_origin`). If a replication origin called
`bdr_local_only_origin` does not exist yet, then LiveCompare creates it on all
BDR connections.

**IMPORTANT**: Please note that BDR 3.6.18 introduced the new pre-created
`bdr_local_only_origin` replication origin to be used for applying local-only
transactions. So if LiveCompare is connected to BDR 3.6.18, it won't create this
replication origin.

LiveCompare will generate apply scripts considering the following:

-   Set the current transaction to use the replication origin
    `bdr_local_only_origin`, so any DML executed will have `xmin` associated to
    `bdr_local_only_origin`;
-   Set the current transaction datetime to be far in the past, so if there are
    any BDR conflicts with real DML being executed on the database, LiveCompare DML
    always loses the conflict.

After applying LiveCompare fix script to a BDR node, it
will be possible to get exactly which rows were inserted or updated by
LiveCompare using the following query (replace `mytable` with the name of any
table):

```postgresql
with lc_origin as (
    select roident
    from pg_replication_origin
    where roname = 'bdr_local_only_origin'
)
select t.*
from mytable t
inner join lc_origin r
on r.roident = bdr.pg_xact_origin(t.xmin);
```

(Note that deleted rows are no longer visible.)

Please note that LiveCompare requires at least a PostgreSQL user with
`bdr_superuser` privileges in order to properly fetch metadata.

All steps above involving replication origins only applied to output script, if
the PostgreSQL user has `bdr_superuser` or PostgreSQL superuser privileges.
Otherwise, LiveCompare will generate fixes without associating any replication
origin (transaction replication is still disabled using
`SET LOCAL bdr.xact_replication = off`). However, it is recommended to use a
replication origin when applying the DML scripts, because otherwise LiveCompare
will have the same precedence as a regular user application regarding conflict
resolution. Also, as there will not be any replication origin associated to the
fix, the query above to list all rows fixed by LiveCompare can not be used.

Between BDR 3.6.18 and BDR 3.7.0, the following functions are used:

-   `bdr.difference_fix_origin_create()`: Executed by LiveCompare to create the
    replication origin specified in `difference_fix_replication_origin` (by default
    set to `bdr_local_only_origin`), if this replication origin does not exist;
-   `bdr.difference_fix_session_setup()`: Included in the generated DML script so
    the transaction is associated with the replication origin specified in
    `difference_fix_replication_origin`;
-   `bdr.difference_fix_xact_set_avoid_conflict()`: Included in the generated DML
    script so the transaction is set far in the past (`2010-01-01`), so the fix
    transaction applied by LiveCompare always loses a conflict, if any.

The functions above require a `bdr_superuser` rather than a PostgreSQL
superuser. Starting from BDR 3.7.0, those functions are deprecated. LiveCompare
then will, if running as a PostgreSQL superuser, use the following functions
instead, to perform the same actions as above:

-   `pg_replication_origin_create(origin_name)`;
-   `pg_replication_origin_session_setup()`;
-   `pg_replication_origin_xact_setup()`.

If a PostgreSQL superuser is not being used, then LiveCompare will include only
the following in the generated DML transaction:

```
SET LOCAL bdr.xact_replication = off;
```

## Conflicts in BDR

LiveCompare has an execution mode called `conflicts`. This execution mode is
specific for BDR clusters. It will only work in BDR 3.6 or BDR 3.7 clusters.

While `compare` mode is used to compare all content of tables as a whole,
`conflicts` mode will focus just in tuples/tables that are related to existing
conflicts that are registered in `bdr.apply_log`, in case of BDR 3.6, or in
`bdr.conflict_history`, in case of BDR 3.7.

Having said that, `conflicts` execution mode is expected to run much faster than
`compare` mode, because it will just inspect specific tuples from specific
tables. At the same time, it's not as complete as `compare` mode, because of the
same reason.

The main objective of this execution mode is to check that the automatic
conflict resolution which is being done by BDR is consistent among nodes, i.e.,
after BDR resolving conflicts the cluster is in a consistent state.

Although, for the general use case, automatic conflict resolution ensures
cluster consistency, there are a few known cases where automatic conflict
resolution can result in divergent tuples among nodes. So the `conflicts`
execution mode from LiveCompare can help checking and ensuring consistency, with
a good balance between time vs result.

### Conflict example

Imagine on `node3` we execute the following query:

```
SELECT c.reloid::regclass,
       s.origin_name,
       c.local_time,
       c.key_tuple,
       c.local_tuple,
       c.remote_tuple,
       c.apply_tuple,
       c.conflict_type,
       c.conflict_resolution
FROM bdr.conflict_history c
INNER JOIN bdr.subscription_summary s
ON s.sub_id = c.sub_id;
```

We can see the following conflict in `bdr.conflict_history`:

```
reloid              | tbl
origin_name         | node2
local_time          | 2021-05-13 19:17:43.239744+00
key_tuple           | {"a":null,"b":3,"c":null}
local_tuple         |
remote_tuple        |
apply_tuple         |
conflict_type       | delete_missing
conflict_resolution | skip
```

Which means that when the `DELETE` arrived from `node2` to `node3`, there was no
row with `b = 3` in table `tbl`. However, the `INSERT` might have arrived from
`node1` to `node3` later, which then added the row with `b = 3` to `node3`. So
this is the current situation on `node3`:

```
bdrdb=# SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE b = 3;
 a | b |  c
---+---+-----
 x | 3 | foo
(1 row)
```

While on nodes `node1` and `node2`, this is what we see:

```
bdrdb=# SELECT * FROM tbl WHERE b = 3;
 a | b | c
---+---+---
(0 rows)
```

The BDR cluster is divergent.

Now in order to detect and fix such divergence, we could execute LiveCompare in
`compare` mode, but depending on the size of the comparison set (imagine table
`tbl` is very large), that can take a long time, even hours.

This is exactly the situation where `conflicts` mode can be helpful. In this
case, the `delete_missing` conflict is visible only from `node3`, but
LiveCompare is able to extract the PK values from the conflict logged rows
(`key_tuple`, `local_tuple`, `remote_tuple` and `apply_tuple`) and perform an
automatic cluster-wide comparison only on the affected table, already filtering
by the PK values. The comparison will then check the current row version in all
nodes in the cluster.

So we create a `check.ini` file to set `all_bdr_nodes = on`, i.e., to tell
LiveCompare to compare all nodes in the cluster:

```
[General Settings]
logical_replication_mode = bdr
max_parallel_workers = 2
all_bdr_nodes = on

[Initial Connection]
dsn = dbname=bdrdb

[Output Connection]
dsn = dbname=liveoutput
```

To run LiveCompare in `conflicts` mode:

```
2ndq-livecompare check.ini --conflicts
```

After the execution, in the console output, you will see something like this:

```
Elapsed time: 0:00:02.443557
Processed 1 conflicts about 1 tables from 3 connections using 2 workers.
Found 1 divergent conflicts in 1 tables.
Processed 1 rows in 1 tables from 3 connections using 2 workers.
Found 1 inconsistent rows in 1 tables.
```

Inside folder `./lc_session_X/` (being `X` the number of the current comparison
session), LiveCompare will write the file `conflicts_DAY.out` (replacing `DAY`
in the name of the file with the current day), showing the main information
about all divergent conflicts.

If you connect to database `liveoutput`, you will be able to see more details
about the conflicts, for example using this query:

```
SELECT *
FROM livecompare.vw_conflicts
WHERE session_id = 1
  AND conflict_id = 1
ORDER BY table_name,
         local_time,
         target_node;
```

You will see something like this:

```
session_id             | 1
table_name             | public.tbl
conflict_id            | 1
connection_id          | node3
origin_node            | node2
target_node            | node3
local_time             | 2021-05-13 19:17:43.239744+00
key_tuple              | {"a": null, "b": 3, "c": null}
local_tuple            |
remote_tuple           |
apply_tuple            |
conflict_type          | delete_missing
conflict_resolution    | skip
conflict_pk_value_list | {(3)}
difference_log_id_list | {1}
is_conflict_divergent  | t
```

The `is_conflict_divergent = true` means that LiveCompare has compared the
conflict and found the nodes to be currently divergent in the tables and rows
reported by the conflict. View `livecompare.vw_conflicts` shows information
about all conflicts, including the non-divergent ones.

LiveCompare will also automatically generate DML script
`./lc_session_X/apply_on_the_node3_DAY.sql` (replacing `DAY` in the name of the
file with the current day):

```
BEGIN;

SET LOCAL bdr.xact_replication = off;
SELECT pg_replication_origin_session_setup('bdr_local_only_origin');
SELECT pg_replication_origin_xact_setup('0/0', '2010-01-01'::timestamptz);;

SET LOCAL ROLE postgres;
DELETE FROM public.tbl WHERE (b) = (3);

COMMIT;
```

LiveCompare is suggesting to `DELETE` the row where `b = 3` from `node3`,
because on the other 2 nodes the row does not exist. By default, LiveCompare
suggest the DML to fix based on the majority of the nodes.

If you run this DML script against `node3`:

```
psql -h node3 -f ./lc_session_X/apply_on_the_node3_DAY.sql
```

You will get the BDR cluster consistent again.

As the `--conflicts` mode comparison is much faster than a full `--compare`, it
is highly recommended to schedule a `--conflicts` comparison session more often,
to ensure conflict resolution is providing cluster-wide consistency.

Please note that, in order to be able to see the data in `bdr.conflict_history`
in BDR 3.7 or `bdr.apply_log` in BDR 3.6, you should run LiveCompare with an
user that is `bdr_superuser` or is a PostgreSQL superuser.

## Mixing technologies

Please note that metadata for `node_name` and `replication_sets` are fetched in
the `Initial Connection`. So it should be a pglogical- and/or BDR-enabled
database.

The list of tables is built in the first data connection. So the
`replication_sets` condition should be valid in the first connection.

It is possible to perform mixed technology comparisons, for example:

-   BDR 1 node versus BDR 3 node;
-   BDR 3 node versus vanilla Postgres instance;
-   Vanilla Postgres instance versus pglogical node.
