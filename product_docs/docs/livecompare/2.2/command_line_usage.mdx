## Compare mode

Copy any `/etc/livecompare/template*.ini` to use in your project and adjust
as necessary (see the section `Settings` below).

```
cp /etc/livecompare/template_basic.ini my_project.ini

livecompare my_project.ini
```

During the execution of LiveCompare, you will see `N+1` progress bars, `N` being
the number of processes (you can specify the number of processes in the
settings). The first progress bar shows overall execution while the other
progress bars show the current table being processed by a specific process.

The information being shown for each table is, from left to right:

-   Number of the process
-   Table name
-   Status, which may be the ID of the comparison round followed by the current
    table chunk (`p1/1` means the table was not split). If the status says
    `setup`, it means the table is being analyzed (checking row count and splitting
    if necessary)
-   Number of rows processed
-   Number of total rows being considered in this comparison round
-   Time elapsed
-   Estimated time to complete
-   Speed in records per second

When table splitting is enabled (`parallel_chunk_rows > 0`), if a table has
more rows than the `parallel_chunk_rows` setting, then a hash function will
be used to determine which job will consider each row. This can slow down
the comparison individually, but the comparison as a whole may benefit
from parallelism for the given table.

While the program is executing, you can cancel it at any time by pressing
`Ctrl-c`. You will see a message like this:

```text
Manually stopping session 6... You can resume the session with:

livecompare my_project.ini 6
```

**Important**: If LiveCompare is running in background or running in another shell,
you can still softly stop it. It will keep the `PID` of the master process inside the
session folder (in the example `lc_session_6`), in a file named `livemaster.pid`. You
can then invoke `kill -2 <PID>` to softly stop it.

Then, at any time you can resume a previously canceled session, for example:

```
livecompare my_project.ini 6
```

When the program ends, if it found no inconsistencies, you will see an output
like this:

```text
Saved file lc_session_5/summary_20190514.out with the complete table summary.
You can also get the table summary by connecting to the output database and executing:
select * from livecompare.vw_table_summary where session_id = 5;

Elapsed time: 0:02:10.970954
Processed 3919015 rows in 6 tables using 3 processes.
Found 0 inconsistent rows in 0 tables.
```

But if any inconsistencies were found, the output will look like this:

```text
Comparison finished, waiting for remaining difference checks...

Outstanding differences:

+--------------+-------------------+-----------------+------------------+----------------------+-------------------+---------------------------+
|   session_id | table_name        | elapsed_time    |   num_total_rows |   num_processed_rows |   num_differences |   max_num_ignored_columns |

+--------------+-------------------+-----------------+------------------+----------------------+-------------------+---------------------------+

Saved file lc_session_6/summary_20200129.out with the complete table summary.
You can also get the table summary by connecting to the output database and executing:
select * from livecompare.vw_table_summary where session_id = 6;

Elapsed time: 0:00:50.149987
Processed 172718 rows in 8 tables from 3 connections using 2 workers.
Found 4 inconsistent rows in 1 tables.

Saved file lc_session_6/differences_20200129.out with the list of differences per table.
You can also get a list of differences per table with:
select * from livecompare.vw_differences where session_id = 6;
Too see more details on how LiveCompare determined the differences:
select * from livecompare.vw_consensus where session_id = 6;

Script lc_session_6/apply_on_the_first_20200129.sql was generated, which can be applied to the first connection and make it consistent with the majority of connections.
You can also get this script with:
select difference_fix_dml from livecompare.vw_difference_fix where session_id = 6 and connection_id = 'first';
```

## Re-check mode

In a BDR environment, any divergence that BDR finds can be later non-existing
as the replication caught up due to eventual consistency. Depending on several
factors, replication lag can cause LiveCompare to report false positives.

To overcome that, in a later moment when replication lag has decreased or data
has already caught up, users can manually execute a re-check only on the
differences that were previously found. This execution mode is called "recheck"
and can be executed like this:

```
livecompare my_project.ini 6 --recheck
```

In this mode, LiveCompare will generate separate recheck logs and update all
reports that are already existing in the `lc_session_X` directory.

**Important**: If resuming a `compare` or executing under `recheck`,
LiveCompare will check if the settings and connections attributes are the same as
when the session was created. If any divergence found, it will quit the execution
with proper message.

## Conflicts mode

To run LiveCompare in `conflicts` mode, you should invoke it with:

```
livecompare my_project.ini --conflicts
```

For more details about the `conflicts` mode, check BDR Support chapter.

## Dry-run mode

For example you have the following INI file:

```ini
[General Settings]
logical_replication_mode = off
difference_tie_breakers = first

[First Connection]
dsn = dbname=testb

[Second Connection]
dsn = dbname=testdb2

[Third Connection]
dsn = dbname=testdb3

[Output Connection]
dsn = dbname=liveoutpu

[Table Filter]
schemas = schema_name = 'public'
```

As the DSN for the `Output Connection` (the LiveCompare cache database) is incorrect,
running LiveCompare initially fails with:

```
Output connection is not reachable.
```

After fixing this, then the `Output Connection` is now reachable, but let's imagine
that only one of the data connections is set correctly. LiveCompare would fail again
with:

```
At least two reachable connections are required.
Following connections are unreachable: first, third.
Following connections are reachable: second.
```

LiveCompare can start a comparison with at least 2 data connections available. So
you go ahead and fix the `Third Connection`, but then LiveCompare still fails with:

```
A difference_tie_breakers host is not a reachable connection: first.
```

This happens because we have set `difference_tie_breakers = first`, and any
connection set as a tie breaker or source of truth needs to be reachable.

After fixing all those issues, then LiveCompare is able to start the comparison.

However, when setting up a comparison from scratch, it's possible to check
beforehand whether or not LiveCompare would abort with a configuration error,
and further abortion checks are all shown in the order they are performed by
LiveCompare.

This is possible with the `--dry-run` mode, which will:

-   Print all execution abortions that would happen due to configuration issues;
-   Print the list of connections with some details, including if it's reachable;
-   Print the `Table Filter`;
-   Print the list of tables that are common to the reachable connections, after
    applying the `Table Filter`.

Here is one sample output, given the INI file exemplified above, and all
configuration errors regarding unreachable connections:

```
$ livecompare test.ini --dry-run
EnterpriseDB LiveCompare 2.2.0, dry-run mode


Output connection is not reachable.

At least two reachable connections are required.
Following connections are unreachable: first, third.
Following connections are reachable: second.

A difference_tie_breakers host is not a reachable connection: first.
