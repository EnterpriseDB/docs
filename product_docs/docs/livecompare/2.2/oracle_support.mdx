LiveCompare can be used to compare data from an Oracle database against any
number of PostgreSQL or BDR databases.

For example, you can define `technology = oracle` in a data  connection. Other
settings can then be used to define the connection to Oracle:

-   `host`
-   `port`
-   `service`
-   `user`
-   `password`

All other data connections are required to be PostgreSQL.

Here is a simple example of comparison between an Oracle database versus a
PostgreSQL database:

```ini
[General Settings]
logical_replication_mode = off
max_parallel_workers = 4
oracle_user_tables_only = on
oracle_ignore_unsortable = on
column_intersection = on
force_collate = C
difference_tie_breakers = oracle

[Oracle Connection]
technology = oracle
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 1521
service = XE
user = LIVE
password = live

[Postgres Connection]
technology = postgresql
dsn = dbname=liveoracle user=william

[Output Connection]
dsn = dbname=liveoutput user=william

[Table Filter]
schemas = schema_name = 'live'
```

Here the `schema_name` in Oracle is the user table sandbox. All table names are
schema-qualified by default:

-   Postgres: `<schema_name> . <table_name>`
-   Oracle: `<user> . <table_name`

It is possible to disable schema-qualified table names by setting
`schema_qualified_table_names = off`. This can be done only if
`oracle_user_tables_only = on`, which means that LiveCompare will search only on
tables that belong to the Oracle user that is connected. When schema-qualified
table names is disabled, then on Postgres you need to have set a default
`search_path` on your role or configuration, or you can use the connection
`start_query` parameter to set an appropriate `search_path`, for example:

```ini
[General Settings]
logical_replication_mode = off
max_parallel_workers = 4
oracle_user_tables_only = on
oracle_ignore_unsortable = on
column_intersection = on
force_collate = C
difference_tie_breakers = oracle
schema_qualified_table_names = off

[Oracle Connection]
technology = oracle
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 1521
service = XE
user = LIVE
password = live

[Postgres Connection]
technology = postgresql
dsn = dbname=liveoracle user=william
start_query = SET search_path = myschema1, myschema2, public

[Output Connection]
dsn = dbname=liveoutput user=william

[Table Filter]
tables = table_name in ('mytable1', 'mytable2')
```

When `schema_qualified_table_names = off`, then you can use non-qualified table
names in the `Table Filter`, `Row Filter` and `Column Filter` too.

Also please note that the `Output Connection` is required to write progress and
reporting information from LiveCompare.

If you need to compare a BDR database against Oracle, and you want to take
advantage about `Initial Connection`, `node_name` and `replication_sets`
features (as explained earlier), then you can point the last data connection to
Oracle, like this:

```ini
[General Settings]
logical_replication_mode = bdr
max_parallel_workers = 4
oracle_user_tables_only = on
oracle_ignore_unsortable = on
column_intersection = on
force_collate = C
difference_tie_breakers = oracle

[Initial Connection]
dsn = port=5432 dbname=live user=postgres

[BDR Connection]
node_name = node1

[Oracle Connection]
technology = oracle
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 1521
service = XE
user = LIVE
password = live

[Output Connection]
dsn = port=5432 dbname=liveoutput user=postgres

[Table Filter]
replication_sets = set_name = 'bdrgroup'
```

It is also possible to compare a whole BDR cluster against a single Oracle
database, for example:

```ini
[General Settings]
logical_replication_mode = bdr
max_parallel_workers = 4
oracle_user_tables_only = on
oracle_ignore_unsortable = on
column_intersection = on
force_collate = C
difference_tie_breakers = oracle
all_bdr_nodes = on

[Initial Connection]
dsn = port=5432 dbname=live user=postgres

[Oracle Connection]
technology = oracle
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 1521
service = XE
user = LIVE
password = live

[Output Connection]
dsn = port=5432 dbname=liveoutput user=postgres

[Table Filter]
replication_sets = set_name = 'bdrgroup'
```

## Requirements

Please note that LiveCompare works on PostgreSQL databases out-of-the-box,
without needing to install any additional software.

But in order to be able to connect to Oracle, LiveCompare requires additional
software:

#### Oracle Instant Client

You need to download and install Oracle Instant Client (or extract it to a
specific folder, depending on the operating system you use):

-   **MacOSX**: Download Oracle Instant Client
    ([64-bit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/intel-macsoft-096467.html))
    and extract in `~/lib`;
-   **Linux**: Download Oracle Instant Client
    ([32-bit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxsoft-082809.html))
    ([64-bit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/linuxx86-64soft-092277.html))
    and install it on your system, then set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`;
-   **Windows**: Download Oracle Instant Client
    ([32-bit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/winsoft-085727.html))
    ([64-bit](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/winx64soft-089540.html))
    and extract it into the LiveCompare folder.

#### cx_Oracle Python module

The Python module [cx_Oracle](https://oracle.github.io/python-cx_Oracle/) is
required to be installed and available on your system so that LiveCompare is
able to connect to an Oracle Database.

Currently cx_Oracle is not installable from Linux distribution repositories, so
please follow
[the instructions in cx_Oracle website](https://cx-oracle.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/installation.html)
to install it on your system.

As LiveCompare is recommended to be executed under the `postgres` operating
system user, then it is possible to install the `cx_Oracle` module through PIP
only for the `postgres` user, with the following command:

```
pip3 install --user cx_Oracle --upgrade
```

## Differences

If LiveCompare finds any difference, it will generate a DML script only to be
applied on the PostgreSQL connections. A DML script to be applied in the Oracle
connection is not generated.

## BLOB and CLOB Data Types

LiveCompare is able to compare `CLOB` fields from Oracle, provided that the
equivalent field in PostgreSQL is of type `text`. The same goes for `BLOB`
fields from Oracle, the equivalent in PostgreSQL should be of type `bytea`.

However, by default LiveCompare does not handle BLOB/CLOB fields if they are in
the primary key, or if the table has no primary key. If that's the case, then
the table will be ignored, and in LiveCompare logs you will see a message like
this:

```
ORA-00932: inconsistent datatypes: expected - got BLOB
```

It is possible to workaround this behaviour by telling LiveCompare to ignore
BLOB/CLOB fields if table has no primary key, by enabling these 2 settings in
the `General Settings` section:

```
oracle_ignore_unsortable = on
column_intersection = on
```

## Incompatible Collation

On Oracle, generally we have the following initialization parameters set:

```
NLS_COMP = BINARY
NLS_SORT = BINARY
```

This means that, regardless of the `NLS_LANG` and other language settings, all
`ORDER BY` operations in Oracle are performed using the character binary code.

In Postgres, the equivalent collation that shows the same behavior is the `C`
collation. If your Postgres database was initialized in a different collation,
then by default LiveCompare might find issues when sorting PK values, which can
lead to false positives.

To workaround that, it is possible to force a collation (say, the `C` collation)
in Postgres, so it matches the same sort behavior from Oracle:

```ini
force_collate = C
```

If LiveCompare detects that the comparison session involves Oracle and PostgreSQL,
then LiveCompare already sets `force_collate = C`, unless the user has set it to
any other value.

## Common Hash

By default, LiveCompare has `comparison_algorithm = block_hash`, even when comparing
PostgreSQL versus Oracle. However, a "common hash" is built following these rules:

-   The row is fully represented as text, by concatenating all column values;
-   On Postgres side, timestamp, numeric and bytea data types are handled to mimic Oracle;
-   This way, the full row representation is then hashed using MD5 on both sides;
-   This allows using `comparison_algorithm` set to `block_hash` and `row_hash`;
-   If there are any mismatches when using `block_hash`, LiveCompare will automatically
    fall back to `row_hash` and then `full_row`, as it would on a Postgres versus
    Postgres comparison.
-   The BLOB, CLOB and NCLOB fields on Oracle are limited to the first 2000 characters
    only (`comparison_algorithm = full_row` allows comparison of the entire BLOB and CLOB);
-   On Oracle, the full row representation should not be wider than 4000 characters.

If the full row representation is wider than 4000 characters, LiveCompare will abort
the comparison for that specific table, and you will see the following error message
in the logs:

```
ORA-01489: result of string concatenation is too long
```

Further LiveCompare versions will fall back to `full_row` comparison on these specific
tables. For now, a workaround would be to configure a separate comparison sessions on
these tables only, using `comparison_algorithm = full_row`.

The Common Hash uses the `standard_hash` function on Oracle 12c and newer. On Oracle
11g, the `standard_hash` function is not available, so LiveCompare tries to use the
`dbms_crypto.hash` function instead, but it might require  additional privileges for
the user on Oracle side, for example:

```sql
GRANT EXECUTE ON sys.dbms_crypto TO testuser;
```
