New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Mongo Foreign Data Wrapper 5.2.8 include:

| Type        | Description                                  |
| ----------- |--------------------------------------------- |
| Enhancement | Support for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 13. |
| Enhancement | Support for Ubuntu 20.04 LTS platform.       |
| Enhancement | Updated LICENSE file.                        |
| Bug Fix     | Fixed crash with COPY FROM and/or foreign partition routing operations. The crash was caused by Mongo Foreign Data Wrapper not supporting routable foreign-table partitions and/or executing COPY FROM on foreign tables. Instead of crashing, Mongo Foreign Data Wrapper now throws an error. |
| Bug Fix     | Fixed issue where casting target list produces 'NULL'.  Correct results are returned not only for have an explicit casts, but also for function calls or operators in the target list. |
| Bug Fix     | Fixed ReScanForeignScan API to make the parameterized query work correctly. Sub-select or correlated queries now use a parameterized plan. |
| Bug Fix     | Changed the server port option's type from int32 to int16 to resolve compilation warnings. Meta driver APIs expect port value in unsigned short type, which resulted in a compilation warning on some gcc versions. |
