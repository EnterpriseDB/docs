| Feature     | Added [`log_remote_query`](/mongo_data_adapter/latest/example_remote_query_logging/) GUC to control logging of remote MongoDB queries.                        |

| Enhancement | Updated `mongoc-driver(1.30.2)` and `json-c(0.18-20240915)` libraries to support MongoDB 8.                                                                   |
| Bug Fix     | Fixed an issue where you couldn't push down joins with full document or whole row references in clauses, or it would generate incorrect output.               |
| Bug Fix     | Fixed an issue where `ORDER BY` pushdown failed or produced incorrect results when sorting by columns from a table participating on the inner side of a join. |
| Bug Fix     | Fixed incorrect appending of `WHERE` clause in `mongo_query_document`.                                                                                        |

| Deprecation | Removed support for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 12 and PostgreSQL 12.                                                                                        |
