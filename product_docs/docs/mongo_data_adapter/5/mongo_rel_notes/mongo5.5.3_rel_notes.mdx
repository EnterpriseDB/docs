| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Enhancement | Added support for PostgreSQL 18.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Enhancement | Added the ability to build the `mongo_fdw` extension directly from PostgreSQL's `contrib` directory.                                                                                                   |
| Feature     | Added [`log_remote_query`](/mongo_data_adapter/latest/example_remote_query_logging/) GUC to control logging of remote MongoDB queries.                                                                 |
| Enhancement | Updated `mongoc-driver(1.30.2)` and `json-c(0.18-20240915)` libraries to support MongoDB 8.                                                                                                            |
| Bug Fix     | Fixed an issue where the FDW pushed down joins with full document or whole row references, which could lead to incorrect output. The FDW now avoids this specific pushdown to ensure data correctness. |
| Bug Fix     | Fixed an issue where `ORDER BY` pushdown failed or produced incorrect results when sorting by columns from a table participating on the inner side of a join.                                          |
| Bug Fix     | Fixed incorrect appending of `WHERE` clause in `mongo_query_document`.                                                                                                                                 |
| Bug Fix     | Fixed an issue where incorrect variable names were generated within the MongoDB query pipeline when querying nested fields (sub-columns).                                                              |
| Deprecation | Removed support for versions 12 of EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB Postgres EXtended Server and PostgreSQL.                                                                                          |
