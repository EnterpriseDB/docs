## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on the same host. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux).

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Address other prerequisites

  ```shell
  # Install the EPEL repository:
  sudo yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo yum -y install edb-as14-mongo-fdw
```

Where `14` is the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server. Replace `14` with the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server you are using.
