These are the key features of the MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper.

## Writable FDW

The MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper lets you modify data on a MongoDB server. You can insert, update, and delete data in the remote MongoDB collections by inserting, updating and deleting data locally in foreign tables.

- [Example: Using the MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper](08_example_using_the_mongo_data_adapter/#example_using_the_mongo_data_adapter)

- [Data type mappings](07_configuring_the_mongo_data_adapter/#data-type-mappings)

## WHERE clause pushdown

MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper allows the pushdown of the `WHERE` clause only when clauses include the comparison expressions that have a column and a constant as arguments. `WHERE` clause pushdown isn't supported where the constant is an array.

## Join pushdown

MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper supports pushdown for inner joins, left joins, and right joins. Currently, joins involving only relational and arithmetic operators in join clauses are pushed down to avoid any potential join failures.

For more information, see [Example: Join pushdown](08a_example_join_pushdown).

## Connection pooling

The MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper establishes a connection to a foreign server during the first query that uses a foreign table associated with the foreign server. This connection is kept and reused for subsequent queries in the same session.

## Automated cleanup

The MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper allows the cleanup of foreign tables in a single operation using the `DROP EXTENSION` command. This feature is especially useful when a foreign table was created for a temporary purpose. The syntax of a `DROP EXTENSION` command is:

 `DROP EXTENSION mongo_fdw CASCADE;`

For more information, see [DROP EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-dropextension.html).

## Full-document retrieval

This feature lets you retrieve documents along with all their fields from collection without any knowledge of the fields in the BSON document available in MongoDB's collection. Those retrieved documents are in JSON format.

You can retrieve all available fields in a collection residing in MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper as explained in the following example.

### Example

```text
> db.warehouse.find();
{ "_id" : ObjectId("58a1ebbaf543ec0b90545859"), "warehouse_id" : 1, "warehouse_name" : "UPS", "warehouse_created" : ISODate("2014-12-12T07:12:10Z") }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("58a1ebbaf543ec0b9054585a"), "warehouse_id" : 2, "warehouse_name" : "Laptop", "warehouse_created" : ISODate("2015-11-11T08:13:10Z") }
```

Steps for retrieving the document:

1.  Create a foreign table with a column name `__doc`. The type of the column can be json, jsonb, text, or varchar.

```text
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE test_json(__doc json) SERVER mongo_server OPTIONS (database 'testdb', collection 'warehouse');
```

2.  Retrieve the document.

```text
SELECT * FROM test_json ORDER BY __doc::text COLLATE "C";
```

    The output:

```text
edb=#SELECT * FROM test_json ORDER BY __doc::text COLLATE "C";
                                                                      __doc                                                                  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "58a1ebbaf543ec0b90545859" }, "warehouse_id" : 1, "warehouse_name" : "UPS", "warehouse_created" : { "$date" : 1418368330000 } }
{ "_id" : { "$oid" : "58a1ebbaf543ec0b9054585a" }, "warehouse_id" : 2, "warehouse_name" : "Laptop", "warehouse_created" : { "$date" : 1447229590000 } }
(2 rows)
```
