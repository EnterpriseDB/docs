These are the key features of the MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper.

## Writable FDW

The MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper lets you modify data on a MongoDB server. You can insert, update, and delete data in the remote MongoDB collections by inserting, updating and deleting data locally in foreign tables.

- [Data type mappings](configuring/#data-type-mappings)

## WHERE clause pushdown

MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper allows the pushdown of the `WHERE` clause only when clauses include the comparison expressions that have a column and a constant as arguments. `WHERE` clause pushdown isn't supported where the constant is an array. From version 5.5.0 and later, we support recursive operator expressions, boolean expressions, Relabel types, and Var's on both sides of an operator.

For more information see [Example: WHERE clause pushdown](08c_example_where_pushdown)

## Join pushdown

MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper supports pushdown for inner joins, left joins, and right joins. Currently, joins involving only relational and arithmetic operators in join clauses are pushed down to avoid any potential join failures.

For more information, see [Example: Join pushdown](08a_example_join_pushdown).

## Aggregate pushdown

MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper supports aggregate pushdown. It pushes the aggregates to the remote MongoDB server instead of fetching all of the rows and aggregating them locally. This gives a very good performance boost for the cases where aggregates can be pushed down. The push-down is currently limited to aggregate functions min, max, sum, avg, and count, to avoid pushing down the functions that are not present on the MongoDB server. The aggregate filters, orders, variadic and distinct are not pushed down.

For more information, see [Example: Aggregate pushdown](08b_example_aggregate_pushdown).

## ORDER BY pushdown

MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper supports order by push-down. If possible, push order by clause to the remote server so that we get the ordered result set from the foreign server itself. It might help us to have an efficient merge join. NULLs behavior is opposite on the MongoDB server. Thus to get an equivalent result, we can only push down ORDERBY with either ASC NULLS FIRST or DESC NULLS LAST. Moreover, as MongoDB sorts only on
fields, only column names in ORDER BY expressions are pushed down.

- [Example: ORDER BY pushdown](example_order_by_push_down)

## LIMIT OFFSET pushdown

MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper supports limit offset push-down. Wherever possible, perform LIMIT and OFFSET operations on the remote server. This reduces network traffic between local PostgreSQL and remote MongoDB servers.

- [Example: LIMIT OFFSET pushdown](example_limit_offset_push_down)

## Connection pooling

The MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper establishes a connection to a foreign server during the first query that uses a foreign table associated with the foreign server. This connection is kept and reused for subsequent queries in the same session.

## Automated cleanup

The MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper allows the cleanup of foreign tables in a single operation using the `DROP EXTENSION` command. This feature is especially useful when a foreign table was created for a temporary purpose. The syntax of a `DROP EXTENSION` command is:

 `DROP EXTENSION mongo_fdw CASCADE;`

For more information, see [DROP EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-dropextension.html).

## Full-document retrieval

This feature lets you retrieve documents along with all their fields from collection without any knowledge of the fields in the BSON document available in MongoDB's collection. Those retrieved documents are in JSON format.

You can retrieve all available fields in a collection residing in MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper as explained in the following example.

### Example

```text
> db.warehouse.find();
{ "_id" : ObjectId("58a1ebbaf543ec0b90545859"), "warehouse_id" : 1, "warehouse_name" : "UPS", "warehouse_created" : ISODate("2014-12-12T07:12:10Z") }
{ "_id" : ObjectId("58a1ebbaf543ec0b9054585a"), "warehouse_id" : 2, "warehouse_name" : "Laptop", "warehouse_created" : ISODate("2015-11-11T08:13:10Z") }
```

Steps for retrieving the document:

1.  Create a foreign table with a column name `__doc`. The type of the column can be json, jsonb, text, or varchar.

    ```sql
    CREATE FOREIGN TABLE test_json(__doc json) SERVER mongo_server OPTIONS (database 'testdb', collection 'warehouse'); 
    ```

2.  Retrieve the document.

    ```sql
    SELECT * FROM test_json ORDER BY __doc::text COLLATE "C";
    ```

    The output:

    ```sql
    edb=#SELECT * FROM test_json ORDER BY __doc::text COLLATE "C";
    __OUTPUT__
                                                                          __doc                                                                  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    { "_id" : { "$oid" : "58a1ebbaf543ec0b90545859" }, "warehouse_id" : 1, "warehouse_name" : "UPS", "warehouse_created" : { "$date" : 1418368330000 } }
    { "_id" : { "$oid" : "58a1ebbaf543ec0b9054585a" }, "warehouse_id" : 2, "warehouse_name" : "Laptop", "warehouse_created" : { "$date" : 1447229590000 } }
    (2 rows)
    ```
