## Updating an RPM Installation

If you have an existing RPM installation of MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper, you can use yum or dnf to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the `edb.repo` file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

     `yum upgrade edb-repo`

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7 on PPCLE:

     `yum upgrade edb-repo`

-   On RHEL or CentOS 8:

     `dnf upgrade edb-repo`

yum or dnf will update the `edb.repo` file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your `edb.repo` file. Then, you can use yum or dnf to upgrade any installed packages:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

     `yum upgrade edb-as<xx>-mongo_fdw edb-libmongoc-libs`

    where `xx` is the server version number.

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7 on PPCLE:

     `yum upgrade edb-as<xx>-mongo_fdw edb-libmongoc-at<yy>-libs`
     
    where `xx` is the server version number and  `yy` is Advance Toolchain major version number. For EDB Postgres Advanced Server versions 9.6 to 11, `yy` must be 10 and for EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 12 and later, `yy` must be 11. 

-   On RHEL or CentOS 8:

     `dnf upgrade edb-as<xx>-mongo_fdw`

    where `xx` is the server version number.
