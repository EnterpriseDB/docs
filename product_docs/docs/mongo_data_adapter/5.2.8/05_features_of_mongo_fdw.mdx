The key features of the MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper are listed below:

## Writable FDW

The MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper allows you to modify data on a MongoDB server. Users can `INSERT`, `UPDATE` and `DELETE` data in the remote MongoDB collections by inserting, updating and deleting data locally in foreign tables. See also:

## Where Clause Push-down

MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper allows the push-down of `WHERE` clause only when clauses include comparison expressions that have a column and a constant as arguments. WHERE clause push-down is not supported where constant is an array.

## Connection Pooling

Mongo_FDW establishes a connection to a foreign server during the first query that uses a foreign table associated with the foreign server. This connection is kept and reused for subsequent queries in the same session.

## Automated Cleanup

The MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper allows the cleanup of foreign tables in a single operation using the `DROP EXTENSION` command. This feature is especially useful when a foreign table has been created for a temporary purpose, as in the case of data migration. The syntax of a `DROP EXTENSION` command is:

> `DROP EXTENSION mongo_fdw CASCADE;`

For more information, see [DROP EXTENSION](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-dropextension.html).
