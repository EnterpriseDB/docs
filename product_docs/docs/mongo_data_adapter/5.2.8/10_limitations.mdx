The following limitations apply to MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper:

-   If the BSON document key contains uppercase letters or occurs within a nested document, MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper requires the corresponding column names to be declared in double quotes.
-   PostgreSQL limits column names to 63 characters by default. You can increase the `NAMEDATALEN` constant in `src/include/pg_config_manual.h`, compile, and re-install when column names extend beyond 63 characters.
-   MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper errors out on BSON field which is not listed in the known types (For example: byte, arrays). It throws an error: `Cannot convert BSON type to column type`.
