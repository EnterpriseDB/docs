Advanced Server ships with the following JDBC drivers:

  - `edb-jdbc16.jar` supports JDBC version 4
  - `edb-jdbc17.jar` supports JDBC version 4.1
  - `edb-jdbc18.jar` supports JDBC version 4.2

The `edb-jdbc16.jar` file is not available for Linux on PowerPC 64 little endian (ppc64le).

To make the JDBC driver available to Java, you must either copy the appropriate java `.jar` file for the JDBC version that you are using to your `$java_home/jre/lib/ext` directory or append the location of the `.jar` file to the `CLASSPATH` environment variable.

Note that if you choose to append the location of the `jar` file to the `CLASSPATH` environment variable, you must include the complete pathname:

> `/usr/edb/jdbc/edb-jdbcxx.jar`
