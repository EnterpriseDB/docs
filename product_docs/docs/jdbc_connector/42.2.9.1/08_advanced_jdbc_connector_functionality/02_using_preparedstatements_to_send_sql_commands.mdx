Many applications execute the same SQL statement over and over again, changing one or more of the data values in the statement between each iteration. If you use a `Statement` object to repeatedly execute a SQL statement, the server must parse, plan, and optimize the statement every time. JDBC offers another `Statement` derivative, the `PreparedStatement` to reduce the amount of work required in such a scenario.

Listing 1.6 demonstrates invoking a `PreparedStatement` that accepts an employee ID and employee name and inserts that employee information in the `emp` table:

Listing 1.6

``` text
public void AddEmployee(Connection con)
{
  try
  {
    Console c = System.console();
    String command = "INSERT INTO emp(empno,ename) VALUES(?,?)";
    PreparedStatement stmt = con.prepareStatement(command);
    stmt.setObject(1,new Integer(c.readLine("ID:")));
    stmt.setObject(2,c.readLine("Name:"));
    stmt.execute();

    System.out.println("The procedure successfully executed.");
  }
  catch(Exception err)
  {
     System.out.println("An error has occurred.");
     System.out.println("See full details below.");
     err.printStackTrace();
  }
}
```

Instead of hard-coding data values in the SQL statement, you insert `placeholders` to represent the values that will change with each iteration. Listing 1.6 shows an `INSERT` statement that includes two placeholders (each represented by a question mark):

``` SQL
String command = "INSERT INTO emp(empno,ename) VALUES(?,?)";
```

With the parameterized SQL statement in hand, the `AddEmployee()` method can ask the `Connection` object to prepare that statement and return a `PreparedStatement` object:

``` SQL
PreparedStatement stmt = con.prepareStatement(command);
```

At this point, the `PreparedStatement` has parsed and planned the `INSERT` statement, but it does not know what values to add to the table. Before executing the `PreparedStatement`, you must supply a value for each placeholder by calling a `setter` method. `setObject()` expects two arguments:

  - A parameter number; parameter number one corresponds to the first question mark, parameter number two corresponds to the second question mark, etc.
  - The value to substitute for the placeholder.

The `AddEmployee()` method prompts the user for an employee ID and name and calls `setObject()` with the values supplied by the user:

``` SQL
stmt.setObject(1,new Integer(c.readLine("ID:")));
stmt.setObject(2, c.readLine("Name:"));
```

And then asks the `PreparedStatement` object to execute the statement:

``` SQL
stmt.execute();
```

If the SQL statement executes as expected, `AddEmployee()` displays a message that confirms the execution. If the server encounters an exception, the error handling code displays an error message.
