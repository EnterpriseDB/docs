When connecting to an external resource (such as a database server), errors are bound to occur; your code should include a way to handle these errors. Both JDBC and the Advanced Server JDBC Connector provide various types of error handling. The [ListEmployees class example](../../42.2.9.1/05_using_the_advanced_server_jdbc_connector_with_java_applications/#using_the_advanced_server_jdbc_connector_with_java_applications) demonstrates how to handle an error using `try/catch` blocks.

When a JDBC object throws an error (an object of type `SQLException` or of a type derived from `SQLException`), the `SQLException` object exposes three different pieces of error information:

  - The error message.
  - The SQL State.
  - A vendor-specific error code.

In the example, the following code displays the value of these components should an error occur:

``` SQL
System.out.println("SQL Exception: " + exp.getMessage());
System.out.println("SQL State: " + exp.getSQLState());
System.out.println("Vendor Error: " + exp.getErrorCode());
```

For example, if the server tries to connect to a database that does not exist on the specified host, the following error message is displayed:

``` SQL
SQL Exception: FATAL: database "acctg" does not exist
SQL State: 3D000
Vendor Error: 0
```
