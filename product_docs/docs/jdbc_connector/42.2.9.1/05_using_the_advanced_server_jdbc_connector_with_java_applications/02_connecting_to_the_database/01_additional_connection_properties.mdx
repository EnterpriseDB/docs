title: "Additional Connection Properties"

<div id="additional_connection_properties" class="registered_link"></div>

In addition to the standard connection parameters, the Advanced Server JDBC driver supports connection properties that control behavior specific to `EnterpriseDB`. You can specify these properties in the connection URL or as a `Properties` object parameter passed to `DriverManager.getConnection()`. Listing 1.2 demonstrates how to use a `Properties` object to specify additional connection properties:

Listing 1.2

```text
String url = "jdbc:edb://localhost/edb";
Properties props = new Properties();

props.setProperty("user", "enterprisedb");
props.setProperty("password", "enterprisedb");
props.setProperty("sslfactory", "com.edb.ssl.NonValidatingFactory");
props.setProperty("ssl", "true");

Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, props);
```

Note

</div>

By default the combination of `SSL=true` and setting the connection URL parameter `sslfactory=org.postgresql.ssl.NonValidatingFactory` encrypts the connection but does not validate the SSL certificate. To enforce certificate validation, you must use a `Custom SSLSocketFactory`. For more details about writing a `Custom SSLSocketFactory`, review [the PostgreSQL JDBC driver documentation](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/ssl-factory.html).

To specify additional connection properties in the URL, add a question mark and an ampersand-separated list of keyword-value pairs:

`String url = "jdbc:edb://localhost/edb?user=enterprisedb&ssl=true";`

Some of the additional connection properties are shown in the following table:

<td>Allows opening connections to only servers with the required state. The allowed values are any, master, secondary, preferSecondary, and preferSyncSecondary. The master/secondary distinction is currently done by observing if the server allows writes. The value preferSecondary tries to connect to secondaries if any are available, otherwise allows connecting to the master. The Advanced Server JDBC Connector supports preferSyncSecondary, which permits connection to only synchronous secondaries or the master if there are no active synchronous secondaries. See Section 5.2.2 for information on preferSyncSecondary. Note: The values slave, preferSlave, and preferSyncSlave have been deprecated as they have been replaced by the “secondary” values. The “slave” values are currently still supported, and the use of the terms “slave” and “secondary” provide the same functionality, however, it is advised to use the “secondary” values.</td>
