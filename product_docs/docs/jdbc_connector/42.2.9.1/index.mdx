The JDBC connector provides connectivity between a Java application and an Advanced Server database. This guide provides installation instructions, usage instructions, and examples that demonstrate the Advanced Server specific functionality of the JDBC Connector.

The JDBC connector is written in Java and conforms to Sun's JDK architecture. For more information, see [JDBC Driver Types](42.2.9.1/#jdbc_driver_types)

The JDBC connector is built on and supports all of the functionality of the PostgreSQL community driver. For more information about the features and functionality of the driver, please refer to the community [documentation](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/index.html).
