A `ResultSet` object is the primary storage mechanism for the data returned by a SQL statement. Each `ResultSet` object contains both data and metadata in the form of a `ResultSetMetaData` object. `ResultSetMetaData` includes useful information about results returned by the SQL command: column names, column count, row count, column length, and so on.

To access the row data stored in a `ResultSet` object, an application calls one or more `getter` methods. A `getter` method retrieves the value in a particular column of the current row. There are many different `getter` methods. Each method returns a value of a particular type. For example, the `getString()` method returns a `STRING` type, the `getDate()` method returns a `Date`, and the `getInt()` method returns an `INT` type. When an application calls a `getter` method, JDBC tries to convert the value into the requested type.

Each `ResultSet` keeps an internal pointer that points to the current row. When the `executeQuery()` method returns a `ResultSet`, the pointer is positioned before the first row. If an application calls a `getter` method before moving the pointer, the `getter` method fails. To advance to the next (or first) row, call the `ResultSetâ€™s next()` method. `ResultSet.next()` is a Boolean method. It returns `TRUE` if there's another row in the `ResultSet` or `FALSE` if you moved past the last row.

After moving the pointer to the first row, the sample application uses the `getString()` `getter` method to retrieve the value in the first column and then prints that value. Since `ListEmployees` calls `rs.next()` and `rs.getString()` in a loop, it processes each row in the result set. `ListEmployees` exits the loop when `rs.next()` moves the pointer past the last row and returns `FALSE`.

```java
while(rs.next())
{
System.out.println(rs.getString(1));
}
```

When using the `ResultSet` interface:

-   You must call `next()` before reading any values. `next()` returns `true` if another row is available and prepares the row for processing.
-   Under the JDBC specification, an application must access each row in the `ResultSet` only once. It's safest to stick to this rule, although currently the EDB Postgres Advanced Server JDBC driver allows you to access a field as many times as you want.
-   When you finish using a `ResultSet`, call the `close()` method to free the resources held by that object.
