Every JDBC object consumes resources. A `ResultSet` object, for example, might contain a copy of every row returned by a query. A `Statement` object might contain the text of the last command executed. It’s usually a good idea to free up those resources when the application no longer needs them. The sample application releases the resources consumed by the `Result`, `Statement`, and `Connection` objects by calling each object’s `close()` method:

```java
rs.close();
stmt.close();
con.close();
```

If you attempt to use a JDBC object after closing it, that object returns an error.
