title: "Freeing Resources"

<div id="freeing_resources" class="registered_link"></div>


Every JDBC object consumes some number of resources. A `ResultSet` object, for example, may contain a copy of every row returned by a query; a `Statement` object may contain the text of the last command executed, and so forth. It’s usually a good idea to free up those resources when the application no longer needs them. The sample application releases the resources consumed by the `Result`, `Statement`, and `Connection` objects by calling each object’s `close()` method:

    rs.close();
    stmt.close();
    con.close();

If you attempt to use a JDBC object after closing it, that object will throw an error.
