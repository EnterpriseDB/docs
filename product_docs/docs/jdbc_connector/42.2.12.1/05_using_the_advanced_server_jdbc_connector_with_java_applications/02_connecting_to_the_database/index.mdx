After the driver has loaded and registered itself with the `DriverManager`, the `ListEmployees` class can attempt to connect to the database server, as shown in the following code fragment:

    String url = "jdbc:edb://localhost:5444/edb";
    String user = "enterprisedb";
    String password = "enterprisedb";
    Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);

All JDBC connections start with the `DriverManager`. The `DriverManager` class offers a static method called `getConnection()` that is responsible for creating a connection to the database. When you call the `getConnection()` method, the `DriverManager` must decide which JDBC driver to use to connect to the database; that decision is based on a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) that you pass to `getConnection()`.

A JDBC URL takes the following general format:

> `jdbc:<driver>:<connection parameters>`

The first component in a JDBC URL is always `jdbc`. When using the Advanced Server JDBC Connector, the second component (the driver) is `edb`.

The Advanced Server JDBC URL takes one of the following forms:

> `jdbc:edb:<database>`
>
> `jdbc:edb://<host>/<database>`
>
> `jdbc:edb://<host>:<port>/<database>`

The following table shows the various connection parameters:
