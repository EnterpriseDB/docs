title: Installing EDB JDBC Connector on AlmaLinux 8 or Rocky Linux 8 x86_64
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on a host that the product can connect to using a connection string. It doesn't need to be on the same host. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux).
- Review [Supported JDBC distributions](/jdbc_connector/latest/02_requirements_overview/#supported-jdk-distribution).

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Other prerequisites

  ```shell
  # Install the EPEL repository:
  sudo dnf -y install epel-release

  #  Enable additional repositories to resolve dependencies:
  sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled PowerTools

  #  Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:
  sudo dnf -qy module disable postgresql
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-jdbc
```
