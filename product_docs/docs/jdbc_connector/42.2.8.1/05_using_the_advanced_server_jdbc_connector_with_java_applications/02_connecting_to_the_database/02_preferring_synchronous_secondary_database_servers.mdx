The Advanced Server JDBC Connector supports the `preferSyncSecondary` option for the `targetServerType` connection property as noted in Table 5-2.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

The `targetServerType` values `slave`, `preferSlave`, and `preferSyncSlave` all provide the same corresponding set of functionality as the `secondary`, `preferSecondary`, and `preferSyncSecondary` values; the `slave` values have been deprecated. We advise you to use the `secondary` values.

The `preferSyncSecondary` option provides a preference for synchronous, standby servers for failover connection, and thus ignoring asynchronous servers.

The specification of this capability in the connection URL is shown by the following syntax:

    jdbc:edb://master:port,secondary_1:port_1,secondary_2:port_2,.../
    database?targetServerType=preferSyncSecondary

</div>

**Parameters**

`master:port`

The IP address or a name assigned to the master database server followed by its port number. If `master` is a name, it must be specified with its IP address in the `/etc/hosts` file on the host running the Java program. **Note:** The master database server can be specified in any location in the list. It does not have to precede the secondary database servers.

`secondary_n:port_n`

The IP address or a name assigned to a standby, secondary database server followed by its port number. If `secondary_n` is a name, it must be specified with its IP address in the `/etc/hosts` file on the host running the Java program.

`database`

The name of the database to which the connection is to be made.

The following is an example of the connection URL:

    String url = "jdbc:edb://master:5300,secondary1:5400/edb?targetServerType=preferSyncSecondary";
    con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, "enterprisedb", "edb");

The following characteristics apply to the `preferSyncSecondary` option:

-   The master database server may be specified in any location in the connection list.
-   Connection for accessing the database for usage by the Java program is first attempted on a synchronous secondary. The secondary servers are available for read-only operations.
-   No connection attempt is made to any servers running in asynchronous mode.
-   The order in which connection attempts are made is determined by the `loadBalanceHosts` connection property as described in Table 5‑2. If disabled, which is the default setting, connection attempts are made in the left-to-right order specified in the connection list. If enabled, connection attempts are made randomly.
-   If connection cannot be made to a synchronous secondary, then connection to the master database server is used. If the master database server is not active, then the connection attempt fails.

The synchronous secondaries to be used for the `preferSyncSecondary` option must be configured for hot standby usage.

The following section provides a brief overview of setting up the master and secondary database servers for hot standby, synchronous replication.

## Configuring Master and Secondary Database Servers Overview

The process for configuring a master and secondary database servers are described in the PostgreSQL documentation.

For general information on hot standby usage, which is needed for the `preferSyncSecondary` option, see [Section 26.5, Hot Standby](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/hot-standby.html).

For information about creating a base backup for the secondary database server from the master, see Section 25.3.2, *Making a Base Backup* (describes usage of the pg\_basebackup utility program) or Section 25.3.3, *Making a Base Backup Using the Low Level API* within Section 25.3 *Continuous Archiving and Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR)* in [The PostgreSQL Core Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/continuous-archiving.html).

For information on the configuration parameters that must be set for hot standby usage, see [Section 19.6, Replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/runtime-config-replication.html).

The following section provides a basic example of setting up the master and secondary database servers.

## Example: Master and Secondary Database Servers

In the example that follows, the:

-   Master database server resides on host `192.168.2.24`, port `5444`
-   Secondary database server is named `secondary1` and resides on host `192.168.2.22`, port `5445`
-   Secondary database server is named `secondary2` and resides on host `192.162.2.24`, port `5446` (same host as the master)

In the master database server’s `pg_hba.conf` file, there must be a replication entry for each unique replication database `USER/ADDRESS` combination for all secondary database servers. In the following example, the database superuser `enterprisedb` is used as the replication database user for both the `secondary1` database server on `192.168.2.22` and the `secondary2` database server that is local relative to the master.

    # TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD
    host    replication     enterprisedb    192.168.2.22/32         md5
    host    replication     enterprisedb    127.0.0.1/32            md5

After the master database server has been configured in the `postgresql.conf` file along with its `pg_hba.conf` file, database server `secondary1` is created by invoking the following command on host `192.168.2.22` for `secondary1`:

    su – enterprisedb
    Password:
    -bash-4.1$ pg_basebackup -D /opt/secondary1 -h 192.168.2.24 -p 5444 -Fp -R -X stream -l 'Secondary1'

On the secondary database server, `/opt/secondary1`, a `recovery.conf` file is generated in the database cluster, which has been edited in the following example by adding the `application_name=secondary1` setting as part of the `primary_conninfo` string and removal of some of the other unneeded options automatically generated by `pg_basebackup`. Also note the use of the `standby_mode = 'on'` parameter.

    standby_mode = 'on'
    primary_conninfo = 'user=enterprisedb password=password host=192.168.2.24 port=5444 application_name=secondary1'

The application name `secondary1` must be included in the `synchronous_standby_names` parameter of the master database server’s `postgresql.conf` file.

The secondary database server (`secondary2`) is created in an alternative manner on the same host used by the master:

    su - enterprisedb
    Password:
    -bash-4.1$ psql -d edb -c "SELECT pg_start_backup('Secondary2')"
    Password:
     pg_start_backup
    -----------------
     0/6000028
    (1 row)

    -bash-4.1$ cp -rp /var/lib/edb/as12/data/opt/secondary2
    -bash-4.1$ psql -d edb -c "SELECT pg_stop_backup()"
    Password:
    NOTICE:  pg_stop_backup complete, all required WAL segments have been archived
     pg_stop_backup
    ----------------
     0/6000130
    (1 row)

On the secondary database server `/opt/secondary2`, create the `recovery.conf` file in the database cluster. Note the `application_name=secondary2` setting as part of the `primary_conninfo` string as shown in the following example. Also be sure to include the `standby_mode = 'on'` parameter.

    standby_mode = 'on'
    primary_conninfo = 'user=enterprisedb password=password host=localhost port=5444 application_name=secondary2'

The application name `secondary2` must be included in the `synchronous_standby_names` parameter of the master database server’s `postgresql.conf` file.

You must ensure the configuration parameter settings in the `postgresql.conf` file of the secondary database servers are properly set (particularly `hot_standby=on`).

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

As of EDB Postgres Advanced Server v12, the `recovery.conf` file is no longer valid; it is replaced by the `standby.signal` file. As a result, `primary_conninfo` is moved from the `recovery.conf` file to the `postgresql.conf` file. The presence of `standby.signal` file signals the cluster to run in standby mode. Please note that even if you try to create a `recovery.conf` file manually and keep it under the `data` directory, the server will fail to start and throw an error.

The parameter `standby_mode=on` is also removed from EDB Postgres Advanced Server v12, and the `trigger_file` parameter name is changed to `promote_trigger_file`.

</div>

The following table lists the basic `postgresql.conf` configuration parameter settings of the master database server as compared to the secondary database servers:

The secondary database server (`secondary1`) is started:

    -bash-4.1$ pg_ctl start -D /opt/secondary1 -l logfile -o "-p 5445"
    server starting

The secondary database server (`secondary2`) is started:

    -bash-4.1$ pg_ctl start -D /opt/secondary2/data -l logfile -o "-p 5446"
    server starting

To ensure that the secondary database servers are properly set up in synchronous mode, use the following query on the master database server. Note that the `sync_state` column lists applications `secondary1` and `secondary2` as sync.

    edb=# SELECT usename, application_name, client_addr, client_port, sync_state FROM pg_stat_replication;
       usename    | application_name | client_addr  | client_port | sync_state
    --------------+------------------+--------------+-------------+------------
     enterprisedb | secondary1       | 192.168.2.22 |       53525 | sync
     enterprisedb | secondary2       | 127.0.0.1    |       36214 | sync
    (2 rows)

The connection URL is:

    String url = "jdbc:edb://master:5444,secondary1:5445,secondary2:5446/edb?targetServerType=preferSyncSecondary";
    con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, "enterprisedb", "password");

The `/etc/hosts` file on the host running the Java program contains the following entries with the server names specified in the connection URL string:

    192.168.2.24            localhost.localdomain master
    192.168.2.22            localhost.localdomain secondary1
    192.168.2.24            localhost.localdomain secondary2

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

Though the connection URL names `secondary1` and `secondary2` happen to match the application names given in the `primary_conninfo` and `synchronous_standby_names` parameters, this is not a requirement. The connection URL names are independent of the application names specified by the `primary_conninfo` and `synchronous_standby_names` parameters.

</div>

For this example, the preferred synchronous secondary connection option results in the first usage attempt made on `secondary1`, then on `secondary2` if `secondary1` is not active, then on the master if both `secondary1` and `secondary2` are not active as demonstrated by the following program that displays the IP address and port of the database server to which the connection is made.

    import java.sql.*;
    public class InetServer
    {
      public static void main(String[] args)
      {
        try
        {
          Class.forName("com.edb.Driver");
          String url =
     "jdbc:edb://master:5444,secondary1:5445,secondary2:5446/edb?targetServerType=preferSyncSecondary";
          String user     = "enterprisedb";
          String password = "password";
          Connection con  = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);

          ResultSet rs = con.createStatement().executeQuery("SELECT inet_server_addr() || ':' || inet_server_port()");
          rs.next();
          System.out.println(rs.getString(1));

          rs.close();
          con.close();
          System.out.println("Command successfully executed");
        }
        catch(ClassNotFoundException e)
        {
          System.out.println("Class Not Found : " + e.getMessage());
        }
        catch(SQLException exp)
        {
          System.out.println("SQL Exception: " + exp.getMessage());
          System.out.println("SQL State:     " + exp.getSQLState());
          System.out.println("Vendor Error:  " + exp.getErrorCode());
        }
      }
    }

**Case 1:** When all database servers are active, connection is made to `secondary1` on `192.168.2.22` port `5445`.

    $ java InetServer
    192.168.2.22/32:5445
    Command successfully executed

**Case 2:** When `secondary1` is shut down, connection is made to `secondary2` on `192.168.2.24` port `5446`.

    bash-4.1$ /usr/edb/as12/bin/pg_ctl stop -D /opt/secondary1
    waiting for server to shut down.... done
    server stopped

    $ java InetServer
    192.168.2.24/32:5446
    Command successfully executed

**Case 3:** When `secondary2` is also shut down, connection is made to the `master` on `192.168.2.24` port `5444`.

    bash-4.1$ /usr/edb/as12/bin/pg_ctl stop -D /opt/secondary2/data
    waiting for server to shut down.... done
    server stopped

    $ java InetServer
    192.168.2.24/32:5444
    Command successfully executed
