The Advanced Server JDBC driver retrieves the results of a SQL query as a `ResultSet` object. If a query returns a large number of rows, using a batched `ResultSet` will:

-   Reduce the amount of time it takes to retrieve the first row.
-   Save time by retrieving only the rows that you need.
-   Reduce the memory requirement of the client.

When you reduce the fetch size of a `ResultSet` object, the driver doesn’t copy the entire `ResultSet` across the network (from the server to the client). Instead, the driver requests a small number of rows at a time; as the client application moves through the result set, the driver fetches the next batch of rows from the server.

Batched result sets cannot be used in all situations. Not adhering to the following restrictions will make the driver silently fall back to fetching the whole `ResultSet` at once:

-   The client application must disable `autocommit`.
-   The `Statement` object must be created with a `ResultSet` type of `TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY` type (which is the default). `TYPE_FORWARD_ONLY` result sets can only step forward through the ResultSet.
-   The query must consist of a single SQL statement.

## Modifying the Batch Size of a Statement Object



Limiting the batch size of a `ResultSet` object can speed the retrieval of data and reduce the resources needed by a client-side application. Listing 1.5 creates a `Statement` object with a batch size limited to five rows.

Listing 1.5

    // Make sure autocommit is off
    conn.setAutoCommit(false);

    Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
    // Set the Batch Size.
    stmt.setFetchSize(5);

    ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM emp");
    while (rs.next())
      System.out.println("a row was returned.");

    rs.close();
    stmt.close();

The call to `conn.setAutoCommit(false)` ensures that the server won’t close the `ResultSet` before you have a chance to retrieve the first row. After preparing the `Connection`, you can construct a `Statement` object:

    Statement stmt = db.createStatement();

The following code sets the batch size to five (rows) before executing the query:

    stmt.setFetchSize(5);

    ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery("SELECT * FROM emp");

For each row in the `ResultSet` object, the call to `println()` prints `a row was returned`.

    System.out.println("a row was returned.");

Remember, while the `ResultSet` contains all of the rows in the table, they are only fetched from the server five rows at a time. From the client’s point of view, the only difference between a `batched` result set and an `unbatched` result set is that a batched result may return the first row in less time.

Next, we will look at another feature (`the PreparedStatement`) that you can use to increase the performance of certain JDBC applications.
