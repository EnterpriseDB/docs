Before you access your SSL enabled server from Java, ensure that you are logged to server via `edb-psql`. The sample output should look like the one below if you have established a SSL connection:

```
$ ./bin/edb-psql -U enterprisedb -d edb
psql.bin (12.0.1)
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.2, cipher: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

edb=#
```
