To install the connector, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, visit the EnterpriseDB website at:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request>

You can use the zypper package manager to install a connector on an SLES 12 host. zypper will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but requires access to specific repositories that are not hosted at EnterpriseDB.

1.  You must assume superuser privileges and stop any firewalls before installing connector. Then, use the following commands to add EnterpriseDB repositories to your system:

    ```text
    zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo
    ```

2.  The commands create the repository configuration files in the `/etc/zypp/repos.d` directory. Then, use the following command to refresh the metadata on your SLES host to include the EnterpriseDB repository:

    ```text
    zypper refresh
    ```

    When prompted, provide credentials for the repository, and specify a to always trust the provided key, and update the metadata to include the EnterpriseDB repository.

3.  You must also add SUSEConnect and the SUSE Package Hub extension to the SLES host, and register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories. Replace 'REGISTRATION_CODE' and 'EMAIL' with your SUSE registration information. Use the commands:

    ```text
    zypper install SUSEConnect
    SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'
    SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.4/x86_64
    SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.4/x86_64
    ```

4.  Install the following repository for resolving the dependencies:

    ```text
    zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Apache:/Modules/SLE_12_SP4/Apache:Modules.repo
    ```

5.  Refresh the metadata on your SLES host:
    ```text
    zypper refresh
    ```

6. Install OpenJDK (version 1.8) for Java based components:

    ```text
    zypper -n install java-1_8_0-openjdk
    ```

7.  Now you can use the zypper utility to install the connector:

    ```text
    zypper install edb-jdbc
    ```
