edb-jdbc18.jar supports JDBC version 4.2.

To make the JDBC driver available to Java, you must either copy the appropriate java `.jar` file for the JDBC version that you are using to your `$java_home/jre/lib/ext` directory or append the location of the `.jar` file to the `CLASSPATH` environment variable.

Note that if you choose to append the location of the `jar` file to the `CLASSPATH` environment variable, you must include the complete pathname:

 `/usr/edb/jdbc/edb-jdbc18.jar`
