<div id="connecting_to_the_database" class="registered_link"></div>

After the driver has loaded and registered itself with the `DriverManager`, the `ListEmployees` class can attempt to connect to the database server, as shown in the following code fragment:

```java
String url = "jdbc:edb://localhost:5444/edb";
String user = "enterprisedb";
String password = "enterprisedb";
Connection con = DriverManager.getConnection(url, user, password);
```

All JDBC connections start with the `DriverManager`. The `DriverManager` class offers a static method called `getConnection()` that's responsible for creating a connection to the database. When you call the `getConnection()` method, the `DriverManager` must decide which JDBC driver to use to connect to the database. The decision is based on a URL that you pass to `getConnection()`.

A JDBC URL takes the following general format:

 `jdbc:<driver>:<connection parameters>`

The first component in a JDBC URL is always `jdbc`. When using the EDB Postgres Advanced Server JDBC Connector, the second component (the driver) is `edb`.

The Advanced Server JDBC URL takes one of the following forms:

 `jdbc:edb:<database>`

 `jdbc:edb://<host>/<database>`

 `jdbc:edb://<host>:<port>/<database>`

The following table shows the various connection parameters.


| Name     | Description                                                                                              |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| host     | The host name of the server. Defaults to localhost.                                                      |
| port     | The port number the server is listening on. Defaults to the EDB Postgres Advanced Server standard port number (5444). |
| database | The database name.                                                                                       |
