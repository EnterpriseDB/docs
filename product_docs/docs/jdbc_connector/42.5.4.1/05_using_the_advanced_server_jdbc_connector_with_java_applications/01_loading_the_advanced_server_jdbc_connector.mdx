The EDB Postgres Advanced Server JDBC driver is written in Java and is distributed as a compiled Java Archive (JAR) file. Include the driver's JAR file in your classpath for the Java runtime to register the driver when it starts up. The registered driver will be used when an application requests a connection URL beginning with the "jdbc:edb:" schema.
