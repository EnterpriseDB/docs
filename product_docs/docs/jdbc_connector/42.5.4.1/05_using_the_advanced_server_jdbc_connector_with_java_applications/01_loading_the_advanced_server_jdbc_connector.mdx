The EDB Postgres Advanced Server JDBC driver is written in Java and is distributed in the form of a compiled Java Archive (JAR) file. Ensure the JAR file is included in your class path and it will automatically be registered when the Java runtime stats up. It will then be used when a application requests a connection URL beginning with the "jdbc:edb:" schema.
