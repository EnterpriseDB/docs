## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on a host that the product can connect to using a connection string. It doesn't need to be on the same host. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux).

- Ensure that Java is installed on your system. You can download a Java installer that matches your environment from the Oracle Java Downloads [website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html). Documentation that contains detailed installation instructions is available through the associated `Installation Instruction` links on the same page.

- Review [Supported JDBC distributions](/jdbc_connector/latest/02_requirements_overview/#supported-jdk-distribution).

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Install the EPEL repository

  ```shell
  sudo dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
  ```

  ```

  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-jdbc
```
