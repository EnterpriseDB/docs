title: "Advanced Server JDBC Connector Logging"

---

The Advanced Server JDBC Connector supports the use of logging to help resolve issues with the JDBC Connector when used in your application. The JDBC Connector uses the logging APIs of `java.util.logging` that was part of Java since JDK 1.4. For information on `java.util.logging`, see [The PostgreSQL JDBC Driver](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/logging.html).

!!! Note
    Previous versions of the Advanced Server JDBC Connector used a custom mechanism to enable logging, which is now replaced by the use of `java.util.logging` in versions moving forward from community version 42.1.4.1. The older mechanism is no longer available.

## Enabling Logging with Connection Properties (static)

You can directly configure logging within the connection properties of the JDBC Connector. The connection properties related to logging are `loggerLevel` and `loggerFile`.

`loggerLevel`

Logger level of the driver. Allowed values are `OFF`, `DEBUG`, or `TRACE`. This option enables the `java.util.logging.Logger` level of the driver to correspond to the following Advanced Server JDBC levels:

| loggerLevel | java.util.logging |
| ----------- | ----------------- |
| OFF         | OFF               |
| DEBUG       | FINE              |
| TRACE       | FINEST            |

`loggerFile`

File name output of the logger. The default is `java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler`. The following example sets the logging level to `TRACE (FINEST)` and the log file `to EDB-JDBC.LOG`:

 `jdbc:edb://myhost:5444/mydb?loggerLevel=TRACE&loggerFile=EDB-JDBC.LOG`

## Enabling Logging with logging.properties (dynamic)

You can use logging properties to configure the driver dynamically (for example, when using the JDBC Connector with an application server such as Tomcat, JBoss, WildFly, etc.), which makes it easier to enable/disable logging at runtime. The following example demonstrates configuring logging dynamically:

```text
handlers = java.util.logging.FileHandler
//logging level
.level = OFF
```

The default file output is in the user’s home directory:

```text
java.util.logging.FileHandler.pattern = %h/EDB-JDBC%u.log
java.util.logging.FileHandler.limit = 5000000
java.util.logging.FileHandler.count = 20
java.util.logging.FileHandler.formatter = java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter java.util.logging.FileHandler.level = FINEST  java.util.logging.SimpleFormatter.format=%1$tY-%1$tm-%1$td %1$tH:%1$tM:%1$tS %4$s %2$s %5$s%6$s%n
```

Use the following command to set the logging level for the JDBC Connector to FINEST (maps to `loggerLevel`):

 `com.edb.level=FINEST`

Then, execute the application with the logging configuration:

 `java –jar -Djava.util.logging.config.file=logging.properties run.jar`
