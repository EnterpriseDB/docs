For information about configuring PostgreSQL or Advanced Server for SSL, refer to:

 <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12.3/ssl-tcp.html>

!!! Note
    Before you access your SSL enabled server from Java, ensure that you can log in to your server via `edb-psql`. The sample output should look similar to the one shown below if you have established a SSL connection:

    ```text
    $ ./bin/edb-psql -U enterprisedb -d edb
    psql.bin (12.0.1)
    SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.2, cipher: ECDHE-RSA-AES256-GCM-SHA384, bits: 256, compression: off)
    Type "help" for help.

    edb=#
    ```
