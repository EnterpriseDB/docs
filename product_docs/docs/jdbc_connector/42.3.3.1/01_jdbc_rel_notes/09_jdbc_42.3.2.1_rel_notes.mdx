| Upstream merge | Merged with the upstream community driver version 42.3.2. See the community [JDBC documentation](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/changelog.html#version_42.3.2) for details.                                                                                                                                   |
| New feature    | `org.checkerframework.*` was previously packaged in the EDB JDBC jar file; causing conflicts with other applications utilizing `org.checkerfamework.*` with different versions.  New feature is packaging the checker framework under a custom namespace in the connector using the shade plugin. [Support Ticket: #74134] |
| New feature    | JMS based API to interact with DBMS_AQ package seamlessly. This API has been made part of edb-jdbc code under com.edb.jms and com.edb.aq packages.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Enhancement    | New property oidTimestamp used to change default behavior of driver when using setTimeStamp method for preparedStatement.  If property oidTimestamp  it is set to true, sets the oid to Oid.TIMESTAMP, otherwise uses default behavior.                                                                                    |
