| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Upstream Merge | Merged with the upstream community driver version 42.5.0. See the community [JDBC documentation](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/changelog.html#version_42.5.0) for details.                                                                                                                        |
| Security Fix   | CVE-2022-31197 - Fixes the SQL generated in PgResultSet.refresh() to escape column identifiers in order to prevent SQL injection. Previously, the column names for both key and data columns were copied as-is into the generated SQL. This allowed for a malicious table with column names that included a statment terminator to be parsed and executed as multiple separate commands. Also, this fix adds a new test class ResultSetRefreshTest to verify this change. |
| Change         | Migrate build to Gradle. |
