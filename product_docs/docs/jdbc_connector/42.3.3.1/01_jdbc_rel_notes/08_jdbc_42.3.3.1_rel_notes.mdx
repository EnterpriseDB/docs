| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Upstream Merge | Merged with the upstream community driver version `42.3.3`. See the community [JDBC documentation](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/changelog.html#version_42.3.3) for details.                                                                                                                        |
| Security Fix   |  [GHSA-673j-qm5f-xpv8](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-673j-qm5f-xpv8): Removed the loggerFile and loggerLevel configuration properties as part of this fix. While the properties still exist, they can no longer be used to configure the driver logging. Instead use java.util.logging configuration mechanisms such as `logging.properties`. |
| Change         | As part of security fix GHSA-673j-qm5f-xpv, the ability to enable logging using the connection properties is no longer available as of version 42.3.3. |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
