In the previous example, `ListEmployees` executed a `SELECT` statement using the `Statement.executeQuery()` method. `executeQuery()` was designed to execute query statements so it returns a `ResultSet` that contains the data returned by the query. The `Statement` class offers a second method that you use to execute other types of commands (`UPDATE`, `INSERT`, `DELETE`, and so forth). Instead of returning a collection of rows, the `executeUpdate()` method returns the number of rows affected by the SQL command it executes.

The signature of the `executeUpdate()` method is:

```text
    int executeUpdate(String sqlStatement)
```

Provide this method a single parameter of type `String` containing the SQL command that you want to execute.

## Using executeUpdate() to INSERT data

The example that follows shows using the `executeUpdate()` method to add a row to the `emp` table.

!!! Note
    The following example isn't a complete application, only a method. These code samples don't include the code required to set up and tear down a `Connection`. To experiment with the example, you must provide a class that invokes the sample code.


```text
    public void updateEmployee(Connection con)
    {
      try
      {
        int rowcount = stmt.executeUpdate("INSERT INTO "
          + "emp(empno, ename) VALUES(6000,'Jones')");
        System.out.println("");
        System.out.println("Success - "+rowcount+
          " rows affected.");
      } catch(Exception err) {
        System.out.println("An error has occurred.");
        System.out.println("See full details below.");
        err.printStackTrace();
      }
    }
```

The `updateEmployee()` method expects a single argument from the caller, a `Connection` object that must be connected to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server database:

```text
    public void updateEmployee(Connection con);
```

The `executeUpdate()` method returns the number of rows affected by the SQL statement (an `INSERT` typically affects one row, but an `UPDATE` or `DELETE` statement can affect more).

```text
    int rowcount = stmt.executeUpdate("INSERT INTO emp(empno, ename)"
    +" VALUES(6000,'Jones')");
```

If `executeUpdate()` returns without an error, the call to `System.out.println` displays a message to the user that shows the number of rows affected.

```text
    System.out.println(""); 
    System.out.println("Success - "+rowcount+" rows affected.");
```

The catch block displays an appropriate error message to the user if the program encounters an exception:

```text
    {
    System.out.println("An error has occurred.");
    System.out.println("See full details below.");
    err.printStackTrace();
    }
```

You can use `executeUpdate()` with any SQL command that doesn't return a result set. However, you probably want to use `PrepareStatements` when the queries can be parameterized.

## Using PreparedStatements to send SQL commands 

Many applications execute the same SQL statement over and over again, changing one or more of the data values in the statement between each iteration. If you use a `Statement` object to repeatedly execute a SQL statement, the server must parse, plan, and optimize the statement every time. JDBC offers another `Statement` derivative, the `PreparedStatement`, to reduce the amount of work required in such a scenario.

The following shows invoking a `PreparedStatement` that accepts an employee ID and employee name and inserts that employee information in the `emp` table:

```text
    public void AddEmployee(Connection con) 
    {   
        try {    
          Console c = System.console();   
          String command = "INSERT INTO emp(empno,ename) VALUES(?,?)";     
          PreparedStatement stmt = con.prepareStatement(command); 
          stmt.setObject(1,new Integer(c.readLine("ID:")));    
          stmt.setObject(2,c.readLine("Name:"));   
          stmt.execute();   
          System.out.println("The procedure successfully executed.");    
          } catch(Exception err) {           
            System.out.println("An error has occurred.");    
            System.out.println("See full details below.");  
            err.printStackTrace();  
          } 
    }
```

Instead of hard coding data values in the SQL statement, you insert placeholders to represent the values to change with each iteration. The example shows an `INSERT` statement that includes two placeholders (each represented by a question mark):

```text
    String command = "INSERT INTO emp(empno,ename) VALUES(?,?)";
```

With the parameterized SQL statement in hand, the `AddEmployee()` method can ask the `Connection` object to prepare that statement and return a `PreparedStatement` object:

```text
    PreparedStatement stmt = con.prepareStatement(command);
```

At this point, the `PreparedStatement` has parsed and planned the `INSERT` statement, but it doesn't know the values to add to the table. Before executing `PreparedStatement`, you must supply a value for each placeholder by calling a `setter` method. `setObject()` expects two arguments:
  
- A parameter number. Parameter number one corresponds to the first question mark, parameter number two corresponds to the second question mark, etc. 
- The value to substitute for the placeholder.

The `AddEmployee()` method prompts the user for an employee ID and name and calls `setObject()` with the values supplied by the user:

```text
    stmt.setObject(1,new Integer(c.readLine("ID:"))); 
    stmt.setObject(2, c.readLine("Name:"));
```

It then asks the `PreparedStatement` object to execute the statement:

```text
    stmt.execute();
```

If the SQL statement executes as expected, `AddEmployee()` displays a message that confirms the execution. If the server encounters an exception, the error handling code displays an error message.

Some simple syntax examples using `PreparedStatement` sending SQL commands follow:

To use the `UPDATE` command to update a row:

```text
    String command = " UPDATE emp SET ename=? WHERE empno=?";     
    PreparedStatement stmt = con.prepareStatement(command); 
    stmt.setObject(1, c.readLine("Name:"));
    stmt.setObject(2,new Integer(c.readLine("ID:"))); 
    stmt.execute();
```

To use the `DROP TABLE` command to delete a table from a database:

```text
    String command = "DROP TABLE tableName";     
    PreparedStatement stmt = con.prepareStatement(command); 
    stmt.execute();
```

To use the `CREATE TABLE` command to add a new table to a database:

```text
    String command = ("CREATE TABLE tablename (fieldname NUMBER(4,2), fieldname2 VARCHAR2(30))"; 
    PreparedStatement stmt = con.prepareStatement(command); 
    stmt.execute();
```

To use the `ALTER TABLE` command to change the attributes of a table:

```text
    String command ="ALTER TABLE tablename ADD COLUMN colname BOOLEAN "; 
    PreparedStatement stmt = con.prepareStatement(command); 
    stmt.execute();
```
