The EDB Postgres Advanced Server JDBC driver is written in Java and is distributed in the form of a compiled Java Archive (JAR) file. Use the `Class.forName()` method to load the driver. The `forName()` method dynamically loads a Java class at runtime. When an application calls the `forName()` method, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) attempts to find the compiled form (the bytecode) that implements the requested class.

The EDB Postgres Advanced Server JDBC driver is named `com.edb.Driver`:

`Class.forName("com.edb.Driver");`

After loading the bytecode for the driver, the driver registers itself with another JDBC class (named `DriverManager`) that's responsible for managing all the JDBC drivers installed on the current system.

If the JVM can't locate the named driver, it reports a `ClassNotFound` exception (which is intercepted with a `catch` block near the end of the program). The `DriverManager` is designed to handle multiple JDBC driver objects. You can write a Java application that connects to more than one database system by way of JDBC.
