## Configuration example

Enable transit with [HashiCorp Vault Transit Secrets Engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs):

```shell
vault secrets enable transit
```

Create a key and give it a name:

```shell
vault write -f transit/keys/pg-tde-master-1
```

Use the `vault write` command with the `pg-tde-master-1` key to wrap and unwrap the data encryption key:

```
PGDATAKEYWRAPCMD='base64 | vault write -field=ciphertext transit/encrypt/pg-tde-master-1 plaintext=- > "%p"'
PGDATAKEYUNWRAPCMD='vault write -field=plaintext transit/decrypt/pg-tde-master-1 ciphertext=- < "%p" | base64 -d'
```
