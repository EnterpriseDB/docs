You can configure TDE to use an external key from Thales CipherTrust Manager to wrap the data encryption key with a key from the Thales key store. You can use either pykmip or the Thales REST API to perform the cryptographic operations of the integration. 

-  To use the Python library pykmip for cryptographic operations with Thales CipherTrust Manager, see [Using pykmip](/partner_docs/ThalesCipherTrustManager/05-UsingThalesCipherTrustManager/) in the [Implementing Thales CipherTrust Manager](/partner_docs/ThalesCipherTrustManager/) documentation for instructions. pykmip is a Python library that implements the KMIP industry standard for key management operations.

-  To use the Thales REST API for cryptographic operations with Thales CipherTrust Manager, [install the EDB TDE Thales REST API client](installing_thales_client) and then [configure it for use with TDE](/tde/latest/secure_key/key_store/thales/thales_restapi). The REST API allows operations to directly connect to Thales CipherTrust, bypassing other intermediate protocols.
