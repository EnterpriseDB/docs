You can protect the data key with a passphrase using the OpenSSL command line utility. This example that sets up this protection: `openssl enc -e -aes-128-cbc -pbkdf2 -out "%p"`

You must provide this OpenSSL command as wrap and unwrap commands to TDE to allow the initdb utility to access the data key when creating a database cluster.

## Providing the wrap and unwrap commands

### Via command argument

To enable encryption on a database cluster, you must specify the wrap and unwrap commands during its creation. One option is to specify them via command argument:

#### Linux 

```shell
initdb -D datadir --data-encryption \
  --key-wrap-command='openssl enc -e -aes-128-cbc -pbkdf2 -out "%p"' \
  --key-unwrap-command='openssl enc -d -aes-128-cbc -pbkdf2 -in "%p"'
```

#### Windows 

```shell
c:\Program Files\edb\as17\bin>initdb.exe -D c:\cdatadir   
--key-wrap-command="openssl enc -e -aes-128-cbc -pbkdf2 -out "%p"" 
--key-unwrap-command="openssl enc -d -aes-128-cbc -pbkdf2 -in "%p"" 
--data-encryption
```

This example wraps the randomly generated data key (done internally by initdb) by encrypting it with the AES-128-CBC (AESKW) algorithm. The encryption uses a key derived from a passphrase with the PBKDF2 key derivation function and a randomly generated salt. The terminal prompts for the passphrase. (See the openssl-enc manual page for details about these options. Available options vary across versions.) The initdb utility replaces `%p` with the name of the file that stores the wrapped key.

The unwrap command performs the opposite operation. initdb doesn't need the unwrap operation. However, it stores it in the `postgresql.conf` file of the initialized cluster, which uses it when it starts up.

The key wrap command receives the plaintext key on standard input and needs to put the wrapped key at the file system location specified by the `%p` placeholder. The key unwrap command needs to read the wrapped key from the file system location specified by the `%p` placeholder and write the unwrapped key to the standard output.

Utility programs like pg_rewind and pg_upgrade operate directly on the data directory or copies, such as backups. These programs also need to be told about the key unwrap command, depending on the circumstances. They each have command line options for this purpose.

### Via environment variable

To simplify operations, you can also set the key wrap and unwrap commands in environment variables before creating the database server. The database creation command will fall back on these environment variables if no wrap and unwrap commands are specified via the command line.

#### Linux

```shell
export PGDATAKEYWRAPCMD='openssl enc -e -aes-128-cbc -pbkdf2 -out "%p"'
export PGDATAKEYUNWRAPCMD='openssl enc -d -aes-128-cbc -pbkdf2 -in "%p"'
```

#### Windows 

```shell 
set PGDATAKEYWRAPCMD=openssl enc -e -aes-128-cbc -pbkdf2 -out %p
set PGDATAKEYUNWRAPCMD=openssl enc -d -aes-128-cbc -pbkdf2  -in %p
```

## Other OpenSSL command options 

### Password prompt on server start

Key unwrap commands that prompt for passwords on the terminal don't work when the server is started by pg_ctl or through service managers such as systemd. The server is detached from the terminal in those environments. If you want an interactive password prompt on server start, you need a more elaborate configuration that fetches the password using some indirect mechanism.

For example, for systemd, you can use `systemd-ask-password`:

```
export PGDATAKEYWRAPCMD="bash -c 'openssl enc -e -aes-128-cbc -pbkdf2 -out "%p" -pass file:<(sudo systemd-ask-password --no-tty)'"
export PGDATAKEYUNWRAPCMD="bash -c 'openssl enc -d -aes-128-cbc -pbkdf2 -in "%p" -pass file:<(sudo systemd-ask-password --no-tty)'"
```

You also need an entry in `/etc/sudoers`:

```
postgres ALL = NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/systemd-ask-password
```

### Providing the passphrase using a file

Another way to simplify operations is to store the passphrase in plaintext so you can reference the file containing the passphrase when securing the data encryption files.

!!!important
   Use this method only for testing or demonstration purposes. Don't store your passphrase in a plaintext file in a production environment.
!!!

1.  Store the passphrase in a file accessible by initdb named `pass.bin`:
    
    ```
    echo "<passphrase>" > /var/lib/postgresql/pass.bin
    ```

1.  Reference the file that contains the passphrase when initializing the TDE-enabled database cluster using the `-pass file:<path_to_file>` flag:

    #### Linux 

    ```
    initdb --data-encryption \
      --key-wrap-command='openssl enc -e -aes-128-cbc -pbkdf2 -pass file:/var/lib/postgresql/pass.bin -out "%p"' \
      --key-unwrap-command='openssl enc -d -aes-128-cbc -pbkdf2 -pass file:/var/lib/postgresql/pass.bin -in "%p"'
    ```

    #### Windows 

    ```shell
    c:\Program Files\edb\as17\bin>initdb.exe -D c:\cdatadir   
    --key-wrap-command="openssl enc -e -aes-128-cbc -pbkdf2 -pass file:/var/lib/postgresql/pass.bin -out "%p"" 
    --key-unwrap-command="openssl enc -d -aes-128-cbc -pbkdf2 -pass file:/var/lib/postgresql/pass.bin -in "%p"" 
    --data-encryption
    ```
