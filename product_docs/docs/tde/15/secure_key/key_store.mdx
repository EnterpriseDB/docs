You can use the key store in an external key management system to manage the data encryption key. The tested and supported key stores are:

- Amazon AWS Key Management Service (KMS)
- Microsoft Azure Key Vault
- Google Cloud - Cloud Key Management Service
- HashiCorp Vault (KMIP Secrets Engine and Transit Secrets Engine)
- Thales CipherTrust Manager
- Fortanix Data Security Manager
- Entrust KeyControl

To use one of the available key stores, see the configuration examples.

## AWS Key Management Service example

Create a key with [AWS Key Management Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/kms/):

```shell
aws kms create-key
aws kms create-alias --alias-name alias/pg-tde-master-1 --target-key-id "..."
```

Use the `aws kms` command with the `alias/pg-tde-master-1` key to wrap and unwrap the data encryption key:

```shell
PGDATAKEYWRAPCMD='aws kms encrypt --key-id alias/pg-tde-master-1 --plaintext fileb:///dev/stdin --output text --query CiphertextBlob | base64 -d > "%p"'
PGDATAKEYUNWRAPCMD='aws kms decrypt --key-id alias/pg-tde-master-1 --ciphertext-blob fileb://"%p" --output text --query Plaintext | base64 -d'
```
!!! Note
    Shell commands with pipes, as in this example, are problematic because the exit status of the pipe is that of the last command. A failure of the first, more interesting command isn't reported properly. Postgres handles this somewhat by recognizing whether the wrap or unwrap command wrote nothing. However, it's better to make this command more robust. For example, use the `pipefail` option available in some shells or the `mispipe` command available on some operating systems. Put more complicated commands into an external shell script or other program instead of defining them inline.

## Azure Key Vault example

Create a key with [Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/):

```shell
az keyvault key create --vault-name pg-tde --name pg-tde-master-1
```

Use the `az keyvault key` command with the `pg-tde-master-1` key to wrap and unwrap the data encryption key:

```shell
PGDATAKEYWRAPCMD='az keyvault key encrypt --name pg-tde-master-1 --vault-name pg-tde --algorithm A256GCM --value @- --data-type plaintext --only-show-errors --output json | jq -r .result > "%p"'
PGDATAKEYUNWRAPCMD='az keyvault key decrypt --name pg-tde-master-1 --vault-name pg-tde --algorithm A256GCM --value @"%p" --data-type plaintext --only-show-errors --output json | jq -r .result'
```
!!! Note
    Shell commands with pipes, as in this example, are problematic because the exit status of the pipe is that of the last command. A failure of the first, more interesting command isn't reported properly. Postgres handles this somewhat by recognizing whether the wrap or unwrap command wrote nothing.

## Google Cloud KMS example

Create a key with [Google Cloud KMS](https://cloud.google.com/kms/docs):

```shell
gcloud kms keys create pg-tde-master-1 --location=global --keyring=pg-tde --purpose=encryption
```

Use the `gcloud kms` command with the `pg-tde-master-1` key to wrap and unwrap the data encryption key:

```shell
PGDATAKEYWRAPCMD='gcloud kms encrypt --plaintext-file=- --ciphertext-file=%p --location=global --keyring=pg-tde --key=pg-tde-master-1'
PGDATAKEYUNWRAPCMD='gcloud kms decrypt --plaintext-file=- --ciphertext-file=%p --location=global --keyring=pg-tde --key=pg-tde-master-1'
```

## HashiCorp Vault Transit Secrets Engine example

Enable transit with [HashiCorp Vault Transit Secrets Engine](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/docs):

```shell
vault secrets enable transit
```

Create a key and give it a name:

```shell
vault write -f transit/keys/pg-tde-master-1
```

Use the `vault write` command with the `pg-tde-master-1` key to wrap and unwrap the data encryption key:

```
PGDATAKEYWRAPCMD='base64 | vault write -field=ciphertext transit/encrypt/pg-tde-master-1 plaintext=- > %p'
PGDATAKEYUNWRAPCMD='vault write -field=plaintext transit/decrypt/pg-tde-master-1 ciphertext=- < %p | base64 -d'
```

## Thales CipherTrust Manager example 

See [Using](/partner_docs/ThalesCipherTrustManager/05-UsingThalesCipherTrustManager/) in the [Implementing Thales CipherTrust Manager](/partner_docs/ThalesCipherTrustManager/) documentation for instructions on how to wrap the data encryption key with a key from the Thales key store.

## Fortanix Data Security Manager example 

See [Using Fortanix Data Security Manager with EDB Postgres for TDE](https://support.fortanix.com/docs/using-fortanix-data-security-manager-with-edb-postgres-for-tde) for a step-by-step configuration tutorial.
