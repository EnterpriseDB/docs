## Data encryption key

The key for transparent data encryption (the data key) is generated by `initdb` and stored in a file `pg_encryption/key.bin` under the data directory. This file contains several keys that are used for different purposes at runtime. The data key is a single sequence of random bytes in the file.

If you don't perform any further action, this file contains the key in plaintext, which isn't secure. Anyone with access to the encrypted data directory has access to the plaintext key, which defeats the purpose of encryption.

## Choosing a mechanism to protect the data encryption key

To secure the data encryption key, you must specify a wrap and an unwrap command that provides TDE with a data encryption protection mechanism. You can set this parameter only at server start.

With the wrap and unwrap commands you can:

- [Protect the data key with a passphrase](passphrase). A wrapping key is derived from the passphrase and used to encrypt the data key.

- [Protect the data key with a wrapping key stored in a key management system](key_store) or key store. This second key is also called the *key-wrapping key* or *master key*.

- You can also choose to [disable the data encryption key wrapping](disabling_key). Only do this for test environments, as it leaves the TDE key unprotected.

## Configuring a wrapping and unwrapping command

After you choose a method to protect your key, you can create the wrapping/unwrapping commands. The configuration of these commands is left to the user, which allows you to tailor the setup to local requirements and integrate with existing key management software or similar. 
 
[Using a passphrase](passphrase) provides an example for wrapping and unwrapping commands using OpenSSL and a passphrase to secure the TDE data key. [Using a key store](key_store) provides an example for wrapping and unwrapping commands using an external key store key to protect the TDE data key.

When you initialize a server with TDE, the `initdb` command adds the `data_encryption_key_unwrap_command` parameter in the `postgresql.conf` configuration file. The string specified in `data_encryption_key_unwrap_command` can then unwrap (decrypt) the data encryption key.

The commands must contain a placeholder `%p`, which is replaced with the name of the file containing the key to unwrap. The command must print the unwrapped (decrypted) key to its standard output.

## Providing the wrapping and unwrapping commands to TDE

You must make the commands available to the TDE database server so it can wrap and unwrap the data encryption key. You have the following options:

- You can configure the wrapping and unwrapping commands as environment variables before creating the database, so TDE can fall back on those variables when initializing a server:

  <details><summary>Example</summary>
  
  ```shell
  PGDATAKEYWRAPCMD='openssl enc -e -aes128-wrap -pbkdf2 -out "%p"'
  PGDATAKEYUNWRAPCMD='openssl enc -d -aes128-wrap -pbkdf2 -in "%p"'
  export PGDATAKEYWRAPCMD PGDATAKEYUNWRAPCMD
  #After these variables are set, you can initialize the server:
  initdb --data-encryption -D /var/lib/edb/as16/data
  ```

  </details>
  <br/>

- You can provide the wrapping and unwrapping commands directly in the command line when initializing a server with the `--key-wrap-command=<command>` and `--key-unwrap-command=<command>` options:

  <details><summary>Example</summary>
  
  ```shell
  initdb --data-encryption -D /var/lib/edb/as16/data --key-wrap-command='openssl enc -e -aes128-wrap -pbkdf2 -out "%p"' --key-unwrap-command='openssl enc -d -aes128-wrap -pbkdf2 -in "%p"'
  ```

  </details>
  <br/>

- You can disable the protection of your data encryption key with `--no-key-wrap`. Doing so leaves your key unprotected and we recommend this practice only for testing purposes.

  <details><summary>Example</summary>
  
  ```shell
  initdb --data-encryption -D /var/lib/edb/as16/data --no-key-wrap
  ```
