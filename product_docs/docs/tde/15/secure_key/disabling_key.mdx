If you don't want key wrapping, for example, for testing purposes, you can use either of the following options to disable key wrapping: 

- You can set the wrap and unwrap commands to the special value `-` when initializing the cluster with `initdb`. For example, you can use the flags `--key-wrap-command=-` and `--key-unwrap-command=-`.

- You can disable key wrapping when initializing the cluster with `initdb` by adding the flag `--no-key-wrap`.

With either of the configurations, TDE generates encryption key files but leaves them unprotected.

For `intidb --data-encryption` to run successfully, you have to either specify a wrapping/unwrapping command, set a fallback environment variable with wrapping/unwrapping commands, or disable key wrapping with one of the previous mechanisms. Otherwise, creating an encrypted database cluster will fail.

!!!note
If you want to enable key wrapping on TDE-enabled database clusters where key wrapping was previously disabled, see [Enabling a mechanism to protect the data encryption key](../enabling/enabling_key_wrapper).
