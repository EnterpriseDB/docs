If you don't want key wrapping, for example for testing purposes, you have two options: 

- You can set the wrap and unwrap commands to the special value `-` when initializing the cluster with `initdb`. For example, with the flags `--key-wrap-command=-` and `--key-unwrap-command=-`.

  With this configuration TDE generates encryption key files, but leaves them unprotected.

- You can disable key wrapping when initializing the cluster with `initdb` by adding the flag `--no-key-wrap`.

  With this configuration TDE generates encryption key files, but leaves them unprotected.

For `intidb --data-encryption` to run successfully, you have to either, specify a wrapping/unwrapping command, set a fallback environment variable with wrapping/unwrapping commands, or disable key wrapping with the one of the previous mechanisms. Otherwise, the database cluster will fail.
