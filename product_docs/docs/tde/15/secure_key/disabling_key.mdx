If you don't want key wrapping, for example for testing, then you must set the wrap and unwrap commands to the special value `-`.

This setting specifies to use the key from the file without further processing. This approach differs from not setting a wrap or unwrap command at all and from setting either or both to an empty string. Having no wrap or unwrap command set when TDE is used leaves your data encryption key unsecured and results in a fatal error when running an affected utility program.
