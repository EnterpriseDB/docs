If you don't want key wrapping, for example, for testing purposes, you can use either one of the following options to disable key wrapping: 

- You can set the wrap and unwrap commands to the special value `-` when initializing the cluster with `initdb`. For example, with the flags `--key-wrap-command=-` and `--key-unwrap-command=-`.

- Or you can disable key wrapping when initializing the cluster with `initdb` by adding the flag `--no-key-wrap`.

With either one of the configurations, TDE generates encryption key files, but leaves them unprotected.

For `intidb --data-encryption` to run successfully, you have to either specify a wrapping/unwrapping command, set a fallback environment variable with wrapping/unwrapping commands, or disable key wrapping with the one of the previous mechanisms. Otherwise, the creation of an encrypted database cluster will fail.
