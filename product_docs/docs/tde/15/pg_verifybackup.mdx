TDE-specific options to pg_verifybackup:

## Options

| Option | Description | 
| ------- | ---------- |
| --key-unwrap-command=*command* | Specifies a command to unwrap (decrypt) the data encryption key. The command should include a placeholder `%p` that specifies the file to read the wrapped key from. The command needs to write the unwrapped key to its standard output. If this is not specified, the environment variable `PGDATAKEYUNWRAPCMD` is used. An empty string means to not apply any key unwrapping command. Specifying this option or the environment variable fallback is required if data encryption is used. See [Key management](/tde/latest/#key-management) for further information. |
