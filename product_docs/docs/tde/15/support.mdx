You can create TDE-enabled database servers on several database distributions and technologies.

## Supported database distributions

You can create TDE-enabled databases on: 

- EDB Postgres Advanced Server 15 and later versions.
- EDB Postgres Extended Server 15 and later versions. 

!!!note 
   EDB doesn't support creating TDE-enabled servers on PostgreSQL. TDE relies on a mechanism developed by EDB for EDB Postgres Advanced and Extended Servers.
!!!

## Supported technologies

You can create TDE-enabled servers in the following environments: 

- [EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD)](/pgd/latest/)
- [EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes](/postgres_distributed_for_kubernetes/latest/) 
- [EDB Postgres for Kubernetes](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/)
