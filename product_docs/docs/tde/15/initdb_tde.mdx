Initializing a TDE-enabled server requires two mandatory settings: one enables TDE and the other protects the data encryption key.

## To enable TDE

To create a TDE-enabled database server, you must use the [`--data-encryption` option](initdb_tde_options/#option---data-encryption-or--y), which creates a data encryption key to encrypt your server.

If you want to copy a key from an existing cluster when preparing a new cluster as a target for pg_upgrade, additionally use the [`--copy-key-from=<file>` option](initdb_tde_options/#option---copy-key-fromfile).

## To protect the data encryption key 

When creating a TDE-enabled database, TDE generates a data encryption key that is transparent to the user.

An additional protection mechanism in the form or a wrapping and an unwrapping command is required to wrap this key, which you must make available to the database server.

See [Providing the wrapping and unwrapping commands to TDE](secure_key) for an overview of the available protection mechanism, and examples of how to provide this configuration to `initdb`.

## Options reference

See [initdb TDE options](initdb_tde_options) for an overview of all mandatory and elective options and supported values.
