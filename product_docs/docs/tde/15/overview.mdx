If you want to start using transparent data encryption (TDE) on your database, you want to either create a TDE-enabled database server or migrate an existing database server to a TDE-enabled environment. It isn't possible to enable TDE on existing instances. 

Regardless of whether you're creating a database server from scratch or creating an instance to migrate an existing database server, you have to create a TDE-enabled database by initializing a database cluster using [initdb](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/app-initdb.html). 

## Before you begin

-   Choose a method to [secure the data encryption key](secure_key) generated by TDE.
    
    You can protect they key with a [passphrase](./secure_key/passphrase/) or a wrapping key from a [key store](secure_key/key_store/). Or you can choose to [not protect the key](secure_key/disabling_key/) for testing purposes.

-   Review the [initdb TDE options](./initdb_tde_options/) to ensure you have all information required for initializing a TDE-enabled database cluster.

-   Review [Limitations and TDE-specific options](./limitations/) to understand limitations and changes in the handling of PostgreSQL utilities when you enable TDE.

-   If you plan on migrating data from an existing database server, ensure you perform a backup of the source database server.

## Initializing a server

1.  Export the wrapping and unwrapping commands to secure the encryption key. Use the wrapping method you chose during the planning phase. 

    Alternatively, you can provide the wrapping and unwrapping commands when initializing the server with the command line arguments.

    See [Providing the wrapping and unwrapping commands](secure_key/#providing-the-wrapping-and-unwrapping-commands-to-tde) for examples.

1.  Initialize a database server with `--data-encryption` enabled on the target directory. Include other [TDE options](initdb_tde_options) as required.

1.  Start the database cluster and [verify that TDE is enabled](./enabling/verifying_tde/).

See [Tutorials](#tutorials) for detailed initialization examples.

## Migrating data (for existing instances)

If you want to migrate data and objects from an existing database server, use pg_upgrade to copy data from an existing instance.

1.  Stop both the source and new server.

1.  Use pg_upgrade with the `--copy-by-block` option to copy data from the source server to the new server. Include other [TDE pg_upgrade options](pg_upgrade_arguments) as required.

1.  Start the new encrypted database server.

1.  Connect to the encrypted database server and ensure the data was transferred.

1.  Perform any required cleanup operations.
