When TDE is enabled, WAL files are encrypted. If you want to perform operations on the encrypted WAL files, you need to allow the operations to decrypt the file. 

When troubleshooting with encrypted WAL files, you can use WAL command options. 

## Dumping a TDE-encrypted WAL file

To work with an encrypted WAL file, you need to ensure the [pg_waldump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgwaldump.html) utility can access the unwrap key and decrypt it. For this purpose, the utility requires awareness of three values.

Pass these values using the following options to the `pg_waldump` command. Be sure to use the same values you used when initializing the TDE-enabled cluster. 

### `--data-encryption`

Specify this option if the WAL files were encrypted by transparent data encryption.

The `--data-encryption` or `-y` option ensures the command is aware of the encryption. Otherwise, `pg_waldump` can't detect whether WAL files are encrypted.

Provide the same encryption configuration you used when initializing the TDE-enabled database cluster. For example, if you specified an AES key length during the cluster creation, you must specify it here as well. Otherwise, run the flag with no values. See [Using initdb TDE options](../initdb_tde_options/) for more information. 

### `--key-file-name=<file>`

Use the `--key-file-name=<file>` option to reference the file that contains the data encryption key required to decrypt the WAL file. Provide the location of the `pg_encryption/key.bin` file. This file is generated when you initialize a cluster with encryption enabled. 

The command can then load the data encryption key from the provided location. 

### `--key-unwrap-command=<command>`

For the `--key-unwrap-command=<command>` option, provide the decryption command you specified to unwrap (decrypt) the data encryption key when initializing the TDE cluster. See [Using initdb TDE options](../initdb_tde_options/) for more information. 

Alternatively, you can set the `PGDATAKEYUNWRAPCMD` environment variable before running the `pg_waldump` command. If the `--key-unwrap-command=<command>` option isn't specified,`pg_waldump` falls back on `PGDATAKEYUNWRAPCMD`. This [cluster initialization example](../enabling/enabling_tde/) shows how to export an environment variable.

### Example

This example uses `pg_waldump` to display the WAL log of an encrypted cluster that uses `openssl` to wrap the data encryption key: 

```
pg_waldump --data-encryption --key-file-name=pg_encryption/key.bin --key-unwrap-command='openssl enc -d -aes-128-cbc -pass pass:<passphrase> -in "%p"'
```

## Resetting a corrupt TDE-encrypted WAL file

To reset a corrupt encrypted WAL file, you must ensure the [pg_resetwal](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgresetwal.html) command can access the unwrap key and decrypt it. You can either pass the key for the unwrap command using the following option to the `pg_resetwal` command or depend on the fallback environment variable.

### `--key-unwrap-command=<command>`

For the `--key-unwrap-command=<command>` option, provide the decryption command you specified to unwrap (decrypt) the data encryption key when initializing the TDE cluster. See [Using initdb TDE options](../initdb_tde_options/) for more information. 

Alternatively, you can set the `PGDATAKEYUNWRAPCMD` environment variable before running the `pg_resetwal` command. If the `--key-unwrap-command=<command>` option isn't specified, `pg_resetwal` falls back on `PGDATAKEYUNWRAPCMD`. This [cluster initialization example](../enabling/enabling_tde/) shows how to export an environment variable.

### Example

This example uses `pg_resetwal` to reset a corrupt encrypted WAL log of an encrypted cluster that uses `openssl` to wrap the data encryption key:

```
pg_resetwal --key-unwrap-command='openssl enc -d -aes-128-cbc -pass pass:<passphrase> -in" "%p"'
```
