TDE encryption ensures that user data remains protected from unauthorized access.

When configured with a [data encryption key securing mechanism](../secure_key/), data stored on the database server and in backup is accessible only by users and processes with decryption keys.

Some use cases include:

- **Protection of sensitive personal data.** Industries like finance, e-commerce, healthcare, and government organizations often deal with personally identifiable information that must be protected to comply with data privacy regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, and PCI DSS.

- **Compliance with government standards.** Government institutions must comply with information processing standards like FIPS to ensure computer security and interoperability.

- **Protecting transactional data.** Financial institutions deal with transaction, account, and payment data that must be protected to prevent fraud and financial losses.

- **Protecting intellectual property.** Organizations safeguard proprietary information, designs, and plans to keep their competitive advantage, support brand value, and foster innovation.

- **Protecting data in cloud-based deployments and public web applications.** Encrypting a database's data provides an added layer of security when infrastructure is shared or when vulnerabilities could potentially infiltrate in an application's API.

When your data is encrypted, it becomes unintelligible if it's stolen or misplaced.
