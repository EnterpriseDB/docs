You can find out whether TDE is present on a server by querying the `data_encryption_version` column of the `pg_control_init` table.

A value of 0 means TDE isn't enabled. Any nonzero value reflects the version of TDE in use. Currently, when TDE is enabled, this value is 1.

```sql
select data_encryption_version from pg_control_init();
__OUTPUT__
 data_encryption_version
-------------------------
                       1
(1 row)
```
