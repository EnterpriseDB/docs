## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on a host that the product can connect to using a connection string. It doesn't need to be on the same host. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux).

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Address other prerequisites

  ```shell
  #  Install the EPEL repository:
  sudo dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

  #  Enable additional repositories to resolve dependencies:
  ARCH=$( /bin/arch ) subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-migrationtoolkit
```

## Initial configuration

Before invoking Migration Toolkit, you must download and install a JDBC driver. See [Installing a JDBC driver](/migration_toolkit/latest/05_installing_mtk/installing_jdbc_driver/) for details.
