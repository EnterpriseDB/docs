You can use the graphical installer to install the Migration Toolkit on Windows. To download the installer, visit the [Downloads page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres#migration-toolkit).

Once you download the installer, right-click the installer icon, and select `Run As Administrator` from the context menu. When the `Language Selection` popup opens, select an installation language and click `OK` to continue to the `Setup` window.

!!! Note
    This guide uses the term Stack Builder to refer to either StackBuilder Plus (distributed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server) or Stack Builder (distributed with the PostgreSQL one-click installer from EnterpriseDB).

You must have a Java JVM (version 1.8.0 or later) in place before Stack Builder can perform a Migration Toolkit installation.

The Java executable must be in your search path `(%PATH% on Windows)` Use the following commands to set the search path (substituting the name of the directory that holds the Java executable for `javadir`):

On Windows, use the command: 

`SET PATH=javadir;%PATH%`

On Linux, use the command:

`PATH=javadir:$PATH`

After setting the search path, you can use the Stack Builder installation wizard to install Migration Toolkit into either EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL.

**Launching StackBuilder Plus from EDB Postgres Advanced Server**

To launch StackBuilder Plus from an existing EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation, navigate through the `Start` (or `Applications`) menu to the EDB Postgres menu; open the `EDB Add-ons` menu, and select the `StackBuilder Plus` menu option.

**Launching Stack Builder from PostgreSQL**

To launch Stack Builder from a PostgreSQL installation, navigate through the `Start` (or `Applications`) menu to the PostgreSQL menu, and select the `Application StackBuilder Plus` menu option.

Stack Builder opens as shown below.

Use the drop-down listbox to select the target server installation from the list of available servers. If your network requires you to use a proxy server to access the Internet, use the `Proxy servers` button to open the `Proxy servers` dialog and specify a server; if you do not need to use a proxy server, click `Next` to open the application selection window.

If you are using StackBuilder Plus to add Migration Toolkit to your EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation, expand the `Add-ons, tools and utilities` node of the tree control, and check the box next to `EnterpriseDB Migration Toolkit`. Click `Next` to continue.

!!! Note
    If you are using Stack Builder to add Migration Toolkit to your PostgreSQL installation, expand the `EnterpriseDB Tools` node of the tree control (`located under the Registration-required and trial productsnode`), and select `Migration Toolkit` checkbox. Click `Next` to continue.
