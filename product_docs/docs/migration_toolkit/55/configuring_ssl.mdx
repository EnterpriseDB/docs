Establish secure TCPS (TLS-encrypted) connections using Migration Toolkit (MTK) to ensure you data is secure and remains private during its usage, particularly when migrating sensitive information. 

Perform the following configurations after Migration Toolkit is installed, but before you invoke it for migration. This example focusses on the configuration required for a migration from an Oracle database to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server database.

## Prerequisites 

- [Set up Oracle Wallet and SSL certificates](https://oracle-base.com/articles/misc/configure-tcpip-with-ssl-and-tls-for-database-connections) to enable your source database server to support SSL/TLS connections.

- If you are using a truststore, ensure you are runnning on JDK 11 or later to fully support the PKCS12 store type.

- If you are not using Oracle wallet, ensure the machine where MTK is installed has the `keytool` command line.

## Source database configuration

### Configuring TCPS (SSL/TLS) 

You must configure your Migration Toolkit installation to be able to establish a secure TCPS (SSL/TLS) connection. Import the Oracle server's certificate to the machien where Migration Toolkit is installed. Since MTK runs on Java, the environment requires to trust the database server's certificate.

No pre-configuration required here, jump to the next session.

</Tab>

<Tab title="Using Truststore">

Import the Oracle server's certificate into a Java truststore that MTK can use.

1.  Locate the Oracle server certificate. It's name should be something similar to this: 

    ```
    ~/<computername>-certificate.crt
    ```

1.  Copy the server certificate to the machine where you have Migration Toolkit installed, to a folder that Migration Toolkit has access to. 

1.  Rename the file extension from `.crt` to `.pem` so the truststore can recognize it. 

1.  From this folder, execute the `keytool` command to import the certificate into a Java truststore: 

    ```
    keytool -importcert \
      -alias oracle-cert \
      -file ~/<computername>-certificate.pem \
      -keystore truststore.p12 \
      -storetype PKCS12 \
      -storepass <store_password>
    ```
    
    Replace <store_password> with a password you want to assign to this specific truststore file.

</TabContainer>

### Configuring JVM options for SSL/TLS

To enable secure SSL/TLS communication, you must define the appropriate Java Virtual Machine (JVM) options in the Migration Toolkit script.

<TabContainer syncKey="ssl">
<Tab title="Using Oracle wallet">

If you are using an Oracle Wallet for your SSL certificates, set the `oracle.net.wallet_location` JVM option to point to your Oracle wallet. For this, modify the `runMTK.sh` or `runMTK.bat` script to contain the following information:

```
runJREApplication $JAVA_HEAP_SIZE \
  -Dprop=$base/etc/toolkit.properties \
-Doracle.net.wallet_location=(SOURCE=(METHOD=FILE)(METHOD_DATA=(DIRECTORY=<PATH_TO_WALLET>))) \
    -cp $base/bin/edb-migrationtoolkit.jar:$base/lib/* \
  com.edb.MigrationToolkit "$@"
```

Where `<PATH_TO_WALLET>` is the specific path to your wallet. 

</Tab>

<Tab title="Using Truststore">

If you are using a truststore for your SSL certificates, configure the following JVM properties in your `runMTK.sh` or `runMTK.bat` script: 

```
runJREApplication $JAVA_HEAP_SIZE \
  -Dprop=$base/etc/toolkit.properties \
  -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStore=<PATH_TO_TRUSTSTORE> \
  -Djavax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword=<TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD> \
  -cp $base/bin/edb-migrationtoolkit.jar:$base/lib/* \
  com.edb.MigrationToolkit "$@"
```

Where `javax.net.ssl.trustStore` is the path to the truststore file that contains the SSL certificate, and `javax.net.ssl.trustStorePassword` is the password you assigned to the truststore file. 

</Tab>
</TabContainer>

### JDBC URL for source Oracle database 

To establish a secure TCPS (TLS-encrypted) connection to your source Oracle database, you must set the `SRC_DB_URL` property in the Migration Toolkit's configuration file correctly, using the following pattern: 

```
SRC_DB_URL=jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCPS)(HOST=<DB_HOST>)(PORT=<DB_PORT>))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVICE_NAME=<DB_SERVICE_NAME>)))
```

## Target database configuration

### Configuring the SSL connection to target server 

Before invoking MTK, ensure your [EDB Postgres Advanced Server is properly set up for SSL/TLS](https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgres-tutorials/how-enable-ssl-authentication-edb-postgres-advanced-server).

### JDBC URL for target server 

To establish a secure TCPS (TLS-encrypted) connection to your target EDB Postgres Advanced Server database, you must set the `TGT_DB_URL` property in the Migration Toolkit's configuration file correctly, using the following pattern: 

```
TGT_DB_URL=jdbc:edb://<host>:<port>/<database>?ssl=true&sslmode=require
```

!!!note 
   Optional: If you want to perform server certificate verification (for example, use `sslmode=verify-ca` or `sslmode=verify-full`), you must place the target server's certificate on the machine where Migration Toolkit is installed.
