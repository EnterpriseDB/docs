Migration Toolkit requires Java version 1.8.0 or later.

## Choosing a driver

Which JDBC drivers you use depends on the source and target databases for the migration. For example, if you are migrating from Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you will need the Oracle Database JDBC driver and the EDB JDBC driver. 

To obtain the correct JDBC driver for your database:

| Source or target database            | JDBC driver                                                                                                                                            |
|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| PostgreSQL                           | [PostgreSQL JDBC driver](https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/)                                                                                        |
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server         | [EDB JDBC connector](/jdbc_connector/latest/installing/) (See notes)                                                                                   |
| Oracle Database                      | [Oracle Database JDBC driver](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-downloads.html)                                                 |
| Microsoft SQL Server                 | [Microsoft JDBC driver for SQL Server](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/connect/jdbc/release-notes-for-the-jdbc-driver?view=sql-server-ver16#102) |
| MySQL                                | [Connector/J JDBC driver](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/j/)                                                                                |
| SAP Adaptive Server Enterprise (ASE) | [Sybase ASE (jTDS) JDBC driver](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jtds/files/) (See notes)                                                              |

!!!note Notes
   - The EDB JDBC connector is not available for Mac OS.
   - The open-source jTDS driver also supports older versions of Microsoft SQL Server (version 2012 and earlier) and may be used with Migration Toolkit. The Microsoft-provided JDBC driver for SQL Server is recommended for the newer versions of SQL Server supported by Migration Toolkit.
!!!

### Driver version compatibility

After you select the correct drivers for your migration, ensure the selected driver versions support the Migration Toolkit you are using. EDB recommends using the latest available Migration Toolkit version, as it provides compatibility with more database versions and JDBC driver versions. 

See [Supported JDBC drivers](../02_supported_operating_systems_and_database_versions/#supported-jdbc-drivers) for more information.

## Adding the driver to `lib`
After downloading the driver, move the driver file into the `<mtk_install_dir>/lib` directory.

!!!note "For the EDB JDBC driver" 
If the EDB JDBC driver is installed prior to installing Migration Toolkit it should not be necessary to place a copy of it in the `<mtk_install_dir>/lib` directory. A symbolic link to the edb-jdbc18.jar file is created during installation of Migration Toolkit.  

After installing Migration Toolkit, you can verify whether the symbolic link exists by executing the following command:

```
ls -l /usr/edb/migrationtoolkit/lib/edb-jdbc18.jar
```
