EDB provides a graphical interactive installer for MacOS. You can access it two ways:

- Download the graphical installer from the [Downloads page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres#migration-toolkit) and invoke the installer directly. See [Installing directly](#installing-directly).

- Use Stack Builder with PostgreSQL to download the EDB installer package and invoke the graphical installer.  See [Using Stack Builder](#using-stack-builder).


## Prerequisites

You must have a Java JVM (version 1.8.0 or later) in place before Stack Builder can perform a Migration Toolkit installation. [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net) offers prebuilt OpenJDK binaries from fully open sources.

You must also set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable. Use the following command:

```shell
JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
```

## Using Stack Builder

If you are using PostgreSQL, you can invoke the graphical installer with Stack Builder. See [Using Stack Builder](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/supported-open-source/postgresql/installer/03_using_stackbuilder/). 

1. In Stack Builder, follow the prompts until you get to the module selection page.

   On the Welcome page, use the drop-down listbox to select the target server installation from the list of available servers. If your network requires you to use a proxy server to access the internet, select `Proxy servers` and specify a server; if you do not need to use a proxy server, click `Next` to proceed.

1. Expand the **Registration-required and trial products** node. 

1. Expand the **EnterpriseDB Tools** node and select **Migration Toolkit**. 

1. Select **Next** and proceed to [Using the graphical installer](#using-the-graphical-installer).


## Installing directly

1. After downloading the graphical installer, use the terminal to execute the following command. If necessary, provide a password when prompted. Superuser or administator privileges are required. 

   ```shell
   sudo ~/Downloads/edb-migrationtoolkit-55.5.0-1-osx.app/Contents/MacOS/installbuilder.sh
   ```
   
1. Proceed to [Using the graphical installer](#using-the-graphical-installer).

## Using the graphical installer 

1. Select the installation language and select **OK**.

1. On the Setup Migration Toolkit page, select **Next**.

1. Read the license agreement. If you accept the agreement, select **I accept the agreement** and select **Next**.

1. Browse to a directory where you want Migration Toolkit to be installed, or allow the installer to install Migration Toolkit in the default location. Select **Next**.

1. On the Ready to Install page, select **Next**.

   An information box shows the installation progress of the selected components. 

1. When the installation has completed, select **Finish**.

   After installing Migration Toolkit, you must install the appropriate JDBC drivers before performing a migration. See [Installing a JDBC driver](/migration_toolkit/latest/installing/installing_jdbc_driver/) for more information.

   !!! Note
    The EDB JDBC driver is not available for Mac OS.
