## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

## Install the package

```shell
sudo apt-get -y install edb-migrationtoolkit
```

## Initial configuration

Before invoking Migration Toolkit, you must download and install JDBC drivers for connecting to the source and target databases. See [Installing a JDBC driver](/migration_toolkit/latest/installing/installing_jdbc_driver/) for details.
