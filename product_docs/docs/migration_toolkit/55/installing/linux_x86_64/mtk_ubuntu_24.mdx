## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the EDB repository.

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

  To determine if your repository exists, enter this command:

  `apt-cache search enterprisedb`

  If no output is generated, the repository isn't installed.

  To set up the EDB repository:

  1. Go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).

  1. Select the button that provides access to the EDB repository.

  1. Select the platform and software that you want to download.

  1. Follow the instructions for setting up the EDB repository.

## Install the package

```shell
sudo apt-get -y install edb-migrationtoolkit
```

## Initial configuration

Before invoking Migration Toolkit, you must download and install JDBC drivers for connecting to the source and target databases. See [Installing a JDBC driver](/migration_toolkit/latest/installing/installing_jdbc_driver/) for details.
