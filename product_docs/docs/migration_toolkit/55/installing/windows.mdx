EDB provides a graphical interactive installer for Windows. You can access it two ways:

- Download the graphical installer from the [Downloads page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres#migration-toolkit) and invoke the installer directly. See [Installing directly](#installing-directly).

- Use Stack Builder (with PostgreSQL) or StackBuilder Plus (with EDB Postgres Advanced Server) to download the EDB installer package and invoke the graphical installer.  See [Using Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus](#using-stack-builder-or-stackbuilder-plus).


## Prerequisites

You must have a Java JVM (version 1.8.0 or later) in place before Stack Builder can perform a Migration Toolkit installation. [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net) offers prebuilt OpenJDK binaries from fully open sources.

The Java executable must be in your search path (`%PATH%` on Windows). On Windows, use the following command to set the search path, substituting the name of the directory that holds the Java executable for `javadir`:

`SET PATH=javadir;%PATH%`


## Installing directly

After downloading the graphical installer, to start the installation wizard, assume sufficient privileges (superuser or administrator) and double-click the installer icon. If prompted, provide a password.

In some versions of Windows, to invoke the installer with Administrator privileges, you need to right-click on the installer icon and select **Run as Administrator** from the context menu.

Proceed to the [Using the graphical installer](#using-the-graphical-installer) section in this topic.

## Using Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus

If you are using PostgreSQL, you can invoke the graphical installer with Stack Builder. See [Using Stack Builder](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/supported-open-source/postgresql/installer/03_using_stackbuilder/). 

1. In Stack Builder, follow the prompts until you get to the module selection page.

   On the Welcome page, use the drop-down listbox to select the target server installation from the list of available servers. If your network requires you to use a proxy server to access the internet, select `Proxy servers` and specify a server; if you do not need to use a proxy server, click `Next` to proceed.

1. Expand the **Registration-required and trial products** node. 

1. Expand the **EnterpriseDB Tools** node and select **Migration Toolkit**. 

1. Proceed to [Using the graphical installer](#using-the-graphical-installer).

If you are using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you can invoke the graphical installer with StackBuilder Plus. See [Using StackBuilder Plus](/epas/latest/epas_inst_windows/installing_advanced_server_with_the_interactive_installer/using_stackbuilder_plus/). 

1. In StackBuilder Plus, follow the prompts until you get to the module selection page. 

   On the Welcome page, use the drop-down listbox to select the target server installation from the list of available servers. If your network requires you to use a proxy server to access the internet, select `Proxy servers` and specify a server; if you do not need to use a proxy server, click `Next` to proceed.

1. Expand the **Add-ons, tools, and utilities** node and select **Enterprise DB Migration Toolkit**. 

1. Proceed to [Using the graphical installer](#using-the-graphical-installer).

## Using the graphical installer 

1. Select the installation language and select **OK**.

1. On the Setup Migration Toolkit page, select **Next**.

1. Read the license agreement. If you accept the agreement, select the **I accept the agreement** option and select **Next**.

1. Browse to a directory where you want Migration Toolkit to be installed, or allow the installer to install Migration Toolkit in the default location. Select **Next**.

1. On the Ready to Install page, select **Next**.

   An information box shows the installation progress of the selected components. This may take a few minutes.

1. When the installation has completed, select **Finish**.

   After installing Migration Toolkit, you must install the appropriate JDBC drivers before performing a migration. See [Installing a JDBC driver](/migration_toolkit/latest/installing/installing_jdbc_driver/) for more information.
