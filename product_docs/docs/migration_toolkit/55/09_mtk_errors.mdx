During the migration process, the migration summary displays the progress of the migration. If an error occurs, the summary displays information about the error. The migration summary is also written to a log file. 

On Linux, the default location for the log files is:

`$HOME/.enterprisedb/migration-toolkit/logs`

On Windows, the log files are saved to:

`%HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\.enterprisedb\migration-toolkit\logs`

You can specify an alternative log file location with the `-logdir <log_path>` option in Migration Toolkit.

## Connection errors

Migration Toolkit uses information from the [toolkit.properties file](06_building_toolkit.properties_file) to connect to the source and target databases. Most of the connection errors that occur when using Migration Toolkit are related to the information specified in the `toolkit.properties` file.

### Invalid username/password

*When I try to perform a migration from an Oracle database with Migration Toolkit, I get the following error:*

```text
MTK-11009: Error Connecting Database "Oracle"
DB-1017: java.sql.SQLException: ORA-01017: invalid username/password;
logon denied
The user name or password specified in the `toolkit.properties` file is
not valid to use to connect to the Oracle source database.
```

To resolve this error, edit the `toolkit.properties` file, specifying the name and password of a valid user with privileges to perform the migration in the `SRC_DB_USER` and `SRC_DB_PASSWORD` properties.

### Invalid file permissions

*When I try to perform a migration with Migration Toolkit, I get the following error:*

```text
MTK-11015: The connection credentials file ../etc/toolkit.properties is
not secure and accessible to group/others users. This file contains
plain passwords and should be restricted to Migration Toolkit owner user
only.
```

To resolve this error, ensure the operating system user account running the Migration Toolkit is the owner of the `toolkit.properties` file with a minimum of read permission on the file. In addition, there must be no permissions of any kind for group and other users. 

The following is an example of the recommended file permissions, where user enterprisedb is running the Migration Toolkit.

`-rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 191 Aug 1 09:59 toolkit.properties`

### Connection rejected: FATAL: password

*When I try to perform a migration with Migration Toolkit, I get the following error:*

```text
MTK-11009: Error Connecting Database "EDB Postgres EDB Postgres Advanced Server"
DB-28P01: com.edb.util.PSQLException: FATAL: password authentication
failed for user "name"
```

The user name or password specified in the `toolkit.properties` file is not valid to use to connect to the Postgres database.

To resolve this error, edit the `toolkit.properties` file, specifying the name and password of a valid user with privileges to perform the migration in the `TARGET_DB_USER` and `TARGET_DB_PASSWORD` properties.

### Exception: ORA-28000: the account is locked

*When I try to perform a migration from an Oracle database with Migration Toolkit, I get the following error message:*

```text
MTK-11009: Error Connecting Database "Oracle"
DB-28000: java.sql.SQLException: ORA-28000: the account is locked
The Oracle account associated with the user name specified in the
toolkit.properties file is locked.
```

To resolve this error, you can either unlock the user account on the Oracle server or edit the `toolkit.properties` file, specifying the name and password of a valid user with privileges to perform the migration in the `SRC_DB_USER` and `SRC_DB_PASSWORD` parameters.

### Exception: oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver

*When I try to perform a migration with Migration Toolkit, the migration fails and I get the error message:*

```text
MTK-11009: Error Connecting Database "Oracle"
java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
```

Before using Migration Toolkit, you must download and install the appropriate JDBC driver for the database that you are migrating from. See [Installing a JDBC driver](/migration_toolkit/latest/installing/installing_jdbc_driver) for complete instructions.

### I/O exception: The Network Adapter could not establish the connection

*When I try to perform a migration with Migration Toolkit, I get the following error:*

```text
MTK-11009: Error Connecting Database "Oracle"
DB-17002: java.sql.SQLException: Io exception: The
Network Adapter could not establish the connection
```

The JDBC URL for the source database specified in the `toolkit.properties` file contains invalid connection properties.

To resolve this error, edit the [toolkit.properties file](06_building_toolkit.properties_file), specifying valid connection information for the source database in the `SRC_DB_URL` property. The `SRC_DB_URL` value is database specific. See [Building the toolkit-properties file](06_building_toolkit.properties_file) for detailed information for your source database type.

### Exception: The URL specified for the “target” database is invalid

*When I try to perform a migration with Migration Toolkit, I get the following error:*

```text
MTK-10045: The URL specified for the "target" database is invalid.
Check the connectivity credentials.
```

The JDBC URL for the target database (EDB Postgres Advanced Server) specified in the `toolkit.properties` file contains invalid connection properties.

To resolve this error, edit the `toolkit.properties` file, specifying valid connection information for the target database in the `TARGET_DB_URL` property. For information about forming a JDBC URL for EDB Postgres Advanced Server, see [Defining an EDB Postgres Advanced Server URL](06_building_toolkit.properties_file/#url-and-parameters-for-an-advanced-server).

## Migration errors

The following errors can occur after Migration Toolkit has successfully connected to the target and source database servers.

### ERROR: Extra data after last expected column

*When migrating a table online, I get the error message:*

```text
MTK-17001: Error Loading Data into Table: table_name
DB-22P04: com.edb.util.PSQLException: ERROR: extra data after last
expected column
Where: COPY table_name, line 5: "50|HR|LOS|ANGELES"
```

This error occurs when the data in a column in `table_name` includes the delimiter character. To correct this error, change the delimiter character to a character not found in the table contents.

!!! Note
    In this example, the pipe character (\|) occurs in the text,`LOS|ANGELES`, intended for insertion into the last column, and the Migration Toolkit is run using the `-copyDelimiter '|'` option, which results in the error.

### Error loading data into table: *TABLE_NAME*

*When performing a data-only migration, I get the following error:*

```text
MTK-17001: Error Loading Data into Table: TABLE_NAME
DB-42P01: com.edb.util.PSQLException: ERROR: relation
"schema.\ table_name" does not exist
*I also get the error:*
Trying to reload table: TABLE_NAME through bulk inserts with a batch
size of 100
MTK-17001: Error Loading Data into Table: TABLE_NAME
DB-42P01: com.edb.util.PSQLException: ERROR: relation
"schema.\ table_name" does not exist
```

You must create a table to receive the data in the target database before you can migrate the data. Verify that a table with a name of TABLE_NAME exists in the target database. Create the table if necessary, and retry the data migration.

### Error creating constraint CONS_NAME_FK

*When I perform a table migration that includes indexes and constraints, I get the following error message:*

```text
MTK-15001: Error Creating Constraint EMP_DEPT_FK
DB-42P01: com.edb.util.PSQLException: ERROR: relation "hr.departments"
does not exist
Creating Constraint: EMP_JOB_FK
MTK-15001: Error Creating Constraint EMP_JOB_FK
DB-42P01: com.edb.util.PSQLException: ERROR: relation "hr.jobs" does not exist
Creating Constraint: EMP_MANAGER_FK
Schema HR imported with errors.
One or more schema objects could not be imported during the migration
process. Please review the migration output for more details.
Migration logs have been saved to
/home/user/.enterprisedb/migration-toolkit/logs
******************** Migration Summary ********************
Tables: 1 out of 1
Constraints: 4 out of 6
Total objects: 7

List of failed objects
======================
Constraints
--------------------
1. HR.EMPLOYEES.EMP_DEPT_FK
2. HR.EMPLOYEES.EMP_JOB_FK
```

The table you're migrating includes a foreign key constraint on a table that doesn't exist in the target database. Migration Toolkit creates the table, omitting the foreign key constraint.

You can avoid generating the error message by including the `-skipFKConst` option in the Migration Toolkit command.

### Error Loading Data into Table

*I've already migrated the table definition; when I try to migrate the data into the table, I get an error:*

```text
MTK-17001: Error Loading Data into Table: DEPARTMENTS
DB-22P04: com.edb.util.PSQLException: ERROR: extra data after last
expected column
Where: COPY departments, line 1: "10 Administration 200 1700"
Trying to reload table: DEPARTMENTS through bulk inserts with a batch
size of 100
MTK-17000: Batch entry 0 INSERT INTO hr.DEPARTMENTS VALUES (10,
'Administration', 200, 1700); was aborted. Call getNextException to see
the cause.
DB-42601: java.sql.BatchUpdateException: Batch entry 0 INSERT INTO
hr.DEPARTMENTS VALUES (10, 'Administration', 200, 1700); was aborted.
Call getNextException to see the cause., Skipping Batch
MTK-17000:ERROR: INSERT has more expressions than target columns
Position: 48
[DEPARTMENTS] Table Data Load Summary: Total Time(s): 0.037 Total Rows:0
Data Load Summary: Total Time (sec): 0.168 Total Rows: 0 Total Size(MB):0.0
Schema HR imported with errors.
```

The table definition in the target database doesn't match the migrated data. If you altered the target or source table, confirm that the table definition and the data are compatible.

### ERROR: value too long for type

*I've already migrated the table definition. When I try to migrate the data into the table, I get the following error:*

```text
MTK-17001: Error Loading Data into Table: DEPARTMENTS
DB-22001: com.edb.util.PSQLException: ERROR: value too long for type
character(1)
Where: COPY departments, line 1, column location_id: "1700"
Trying to reload table: DEPARTMENTS through bulk inserts with a batch
size of 100
MTK-17000: Batch entry 0 INSERT INTO hr.DEPARTMENTS VALUES (10,
'Administration', 200, 1700); was aborted. Call getNextException to see
the cause.
DB-22001: java.sql.BatchUpdateException: Batch entry 0 INSERT INTO
hr.DEPARTMENTS VALUES (10, 'Administration', 200, 1700); was aborted.
Call getNextException to see the cause., Skipping Batch
MTK-17000:ERROR: value too long for type character(1)
```

A column in the target database is not large enough to receive the migrated data. This problem can occur if the table definition is altered after migration. The column name (in this example, location_id) is identified in the line that begins with `Where:`.

Where: `COPY departments, line 1, column location_id: "1700"`

To correct the problem, adjust the column size and retry the migration.

### ERROR: Exception in thread:OutOfMemoryError

*When migrating from a MySQL database, I encounter the following error:*

```text
Loading Table: big_range ...
Exception in thread "dataload_job_1" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java

at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:722)
```

By default, the MySQL JDBC driver fetches all of the rows in a table into Migration Toolkit in a single network round trip. This behavior can easily exceed available memory for large tables.

To correct the problem, specify `-fetchSize 1` as a command-line argument when you retry the migration.

### Incorrect timestamps and Daylight Saving Time

When migrating from SQL Server to PostgreSQL using the MSSQL JDBC driver, an error in the migration of timestamps may occur that is not reported. Specifically, if the source database contains rows with timestamp values that are within a range of time when Daylight Savings Time was in effect, those rows will be migrated to the target database with the wrong timestamps.

To resolve this issue, update the `runMTK.sh` file, and provide the option `-Duser.timezone=GMT`. This option will then be in effect when you run the toolkit.

For example, suppose this is the original line:

```text
runJREApplication $JAVA_HEAP_SIZE -Dprop=$base/etc/toolkit.properties -cp $base/bin/edb-migrationtoolkit.jar:$base/lib/* com.edb.MigrationToolkit "$@"
```

Update this line by inserting `-Duser.timezone=GMT` before the `-cp` option:

```text
runJREApplication $JAVA_HEAP_SIZE -Dprop=$base/etc/toolkit.properties -Duser.timezone=GMT -cp $base/bin/edb-migrationtoolkit.jar:$base/lib/* com.edb.MigrationToolkit "$@"
```
