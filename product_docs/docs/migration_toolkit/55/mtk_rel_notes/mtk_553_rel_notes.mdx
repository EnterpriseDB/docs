| Enhancement  | Migration Toolkit is now certified to work with the Microsoft provided SQL Server JDBC driver version 10.2. Although the open source  jTDS driver can still be used for connections to Microsoft SQL Server with Migration Toolkit, it is recommended that the Microsoft provided SQL Server JDBC driver be used instead as it provides support for the more recent versions of SQL Server. |
| Enhancement  | Migration Toolkit  is now certified to work on the Debian 11 platform.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Security Fix | Migration Toolkit has been certified with the latest EDB JDBC driver version 42.5.0.1 and PostgreSQL community JDBC driver version 42.5.0 that contain the security fix for [CVE-2022-31197](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-31197).                                                                                                                                              |
| Security Fix | Migration Toolkit has been certified to work with the  MySQL JDBC driver version 8.0.30 that contains the security fix for [CVE-2022-21363](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21363). References to the MySQL JDBC driver in the Migration Toolkit document have been correspondingly updated.                                                                                      |
| Bug Fix      | Fixed an issue where an Oracle table migration to EPAS fails when it contains a virtual column. [Support Ticket # 82718]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Other        | Removed support of Microsoft SQL Server 2008 and SQL Server Server 2012 for use with Migration Toolkit since these versions are no longer supported by Microsoft.  These versions had previously been tested and certified for use with Migration Toolkit.  Although they may continue to work with Migration Toolkit, EDB is no longer performing ongoing verification of them. |
