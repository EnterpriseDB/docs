| Enhancement  | Migration Toolkit now supports PostgreSQL version 17 and EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 17 both as a source and target database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |        |
| Enhancement  | Improved the handling and consistency in migrating virtual columns across different source and target database combinations. <br/> You can now choose whether to migrate virtual columns as virtual columns or map them to regular columns in the target. See [mapVirtualToRegular](../07_invoking_mtk/08_mtk_command_options/#-mapvirtualtoregular) for more information. | #38897 |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue that caused synonyms from all source schemas to be migrated even when only one schema was selected for migration.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | #41178 |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where the MySQL column type `BIGINT AUTO_INCREMENT` isn't mapped to the `BIGSERIAL` column type in the target PostgreSQL/EDB Postgres Advanced Server table.                                                                                                                                                                                         |        |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed the issue where migration fails in parallel mode for a table with a primary key based on the float data type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |        |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where the indexes are skipped from migration when multiple tables are selected for a source MySQL database.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |        |
