| Enhancement  | Migration Toolkit is now certified to work with PostgreSQL version 15. PostgreSQL 15 is now supported both as a source and/or target for different migration permutations. |
| Bug fix  | Fixed an issue that caused table constraint failure when multiple MySQL source tables share the same constraint name. [Support ticket #86413] |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue that resulted in the data migration failure for a MySQL table row with a text column value ending with a backslash. [Support ticket #86412] |
| Other   | Removed support of PostgreSQL 10 and EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) 10 for use with Migration Toolkit. These versions of PostgreSQL and EPAS have reached end of life and are no longer supported under the normal support agreements. |
| Other   | Removed support of Oracle 10g for use with Migration Toolkit. This version had previously been tested and certified for use with Migration Toolkit. Although Oracle 10g may continue to work with Migration Toolkit, EDB is no longer performing ongoing verification of it. |
