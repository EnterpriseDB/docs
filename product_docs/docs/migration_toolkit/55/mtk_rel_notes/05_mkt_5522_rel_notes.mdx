New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Migration Toolkit 55.2.2 include:

| Type         | Description |
| ------------ |------------ |
| Enhancement  | Provides support for SQL Server 2016, 2017, and 2019 and Sybase (SAP ASE) 16.0. |
| Security Fix | The installers used for Windows and MacOS have been updated to include the latest version of the EDB JDBC Connector which addresses [CVE-2022-2174](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21724). For Linux, the JDBC driver is not packaged with Migration Toolkit and you will need to update the driver separately using the instructions for Linux documented in this EDB [knowledge base article](https://techsupport.enterprisedb.com/kb/a/cve-2022-21724-jdbc-driver-update-for-migration-toolkit--mtk-/). |
| Bug Fix      | Migration Toolkit now properly handles an exception if ENABLE TRIGGER fails while loading table data. If ENABLE TRIGGER fails for a particular table it is not skipped for the remaining tables.  |
| Bug Fix      | Migration Toolkit now escapes backslashes coming in TEXT fields while migrating from a MySQL database. |
