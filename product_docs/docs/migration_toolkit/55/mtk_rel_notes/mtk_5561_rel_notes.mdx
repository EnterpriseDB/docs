| Enhancement  | Updated the table-level parallel loading capability with to reduce the overhead on the source database by using range-based criterion for loading each individual table data chunk instead of a fetch-offset approach. This optimization is applicable when the table primary key/unique constraint is based on a non-composite numeric type attribute. [Support ticket #93360] |
| Bug fix | Fixed the issue where a data copy fails when migrating a source Oracle table that has a full-width character in its name. [Support ticket #93552] |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue that caused a data copy to fail when a source MySQL table name contains a dash character. [Support ticket #95794] |
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue that resulted in table creation failure for a source MySQL table that has a `DEFAULT` clause defined with one or more single-quote characters. [Support ticket #95794]|
| Bug fix | Fixed an issue that caused a data copy to fail when a source MySQL table uses a MySQL reserved word as its name. [Support ticket #94822] |
| Bug fix | Fixed the issue encountered during Microsoft SQL Server to EDB Postgres Advanced Server, Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server, or EDB Postgres Advanced Server to Oracle `-dataOnly` migrations where foreign key constraints are not restored after the data copy completes if the `-tables` option is specified and the parent table isn't included in the list of specified tables. |
