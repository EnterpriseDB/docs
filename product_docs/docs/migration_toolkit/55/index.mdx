Migration Toolkit is a powerful command-line tool that offers granular control of the migration process. Migration Toolkit helps with migrating database objects and data to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database from:

-   Oracle
-   MySQL
-   Microsoft SQL Server

You can also use Migration Toolkit to migrate database objects and data from Sybase Adaptive Server Enterprise to EDB Postgres Advanced Server or between EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL.

You can install Migration Toolkit with the EDB Postgres Advanced Server installer or by using Stack Builder. Stack Builder is distributed with both the EDB Postgres Advanced Server and the PostgreSQL one-click installer available from the [EnterpriseDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres).

!!! Note
    The term Postgres in this documentation refers to either an installation of EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL. The term Stack Builder refers to either StackBuilder Plus (distributed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server) or Stack Builder (distributed with the PostgreSQL one-click installer from EnterpriseDB).
