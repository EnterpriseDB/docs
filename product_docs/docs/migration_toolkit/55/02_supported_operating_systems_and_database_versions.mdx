!!!Note

All the PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server versions available as EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service single-node, primary/standby high-availability, and distributed high-availability cluster types are also supported for use with Migration Toolkit. See the Cloud Service [documentation](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/) for more information about Cloud Serviceâ€™s [supported cluster types](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/references/supported_cluster_types/). See the [database version policy documentation](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/references/supported_database_versions/) for the versions of PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server available in Cloud Service.

The superuser role isn't available in EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service EDB Postgres Advanced Server distributed high-availability cluster databases. As a result, the following Migration Toolkit capabilities that require superuser access aren't supported when targeting Cloud Service distributed high-availability clusters:

-   The `-copyViaDBLinkOra` option that enables data migration using the db_link_ora extension
-   The Oracle-compatible SQL command `CREATE DATABASE LINK`
!!!

Contact your EnterpriseDB Account Manager or [sales@enterprisedb.com](mailto:sales@enterprisedb.com) if you require support for other database products.

!!!Note

The Migration Toolkit isn't tested with and doesn't officially support use with Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) and Exadata. However, Migration Toolkit might work when it's connected to a single persistent node. For more information, contact your EDB representative.

## Supported operating systems versions

Migration Toolkit supports installations on Linux, Windows, and MacOS platforms. See [Product Compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/platform-compatibility#mtk) for details.

!!! Note

    The ojdbc7.jar can cause large data migrations to be incomplete due to a limit on records over Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647) while fetching from the ResultSet. To avoid this issue, we recommend upgrading to ojdbc8.jar.
