The following enhancements have been added to the EDB Postgres Migration Toolkit for the 55.0.0 release:

- Table-level Parallel Data Loading

  Migration Toolkit is now enhanced to support parallel data loading at the table level such that multiple threads are used to load data in parallel from the source database table and apply in parallel on the target database table. This significantly improves the data load time when dealing with relatively large size tables. The lab benchmark results have revealed 25-60% reduction in the data load duration for a large table when using multiple parallel threads. This feature is supported for source PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Advanced Server, and Oracle databases.

- Addition of New Command-line Options

  As part of the table-level parallel data loading enhancement, the following new options have been added to the MTK command-line options list:

  - tableLoaderLimit
  - parallelLoadRowLimit

- Migration Support for Oracle 18c and 19c

  Enablement of schema and data migration from Oracle version 18c and 19c

- Report total migration time (for schema and data migration)

  Now total migration time for the migration session is reported via the `“Total Elapsed Migration Time”` attribute.
