Migration Toolkit is a powerful command-line tool that offers granular control of the migration process. Using Migration Toolkit is a two-step process:

1.  Edit the `toolkit.properties` file to specify the source and target database.

2.  Invoke Migration Toolkit at the command line, specifying migration options.

Migration Toolkit facilitates migration of database objects and data to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database from:

-   Oracle
-   MySQL
-   SQL Server

Migration Toolkit also allows you to migrate database objects and data to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server database from Sybase. You can also use Migration Toolkit to migrate between EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL. Migration Toolkit includes a number of options, allowing you granular control of the migration process:

-   Use the `-safeMode` option to commit each row as it is migrated.
-   Use the `-fastCopy` option to bypass WAL logging to optimize migration.
-   Use the `-batchSize` option to control the batch size of bulk inserts.
-   Use the `-cpBatchSize` option to specify the batch size used with the COPY command.
-   Use the `-lobBatchSize` option to specify the batch size used for large object data types.
-   Use the `-filterProp` option to migrate only those rows that meet a user-defined condition.
-   Use the `-customColTypeMapping` option to change the data type of selected columns.
-   Use the `-dropSchema` option to drop the existing schema and create a new schema prior to migration.
-   On EDB Postgres Advanced Server, use the `-allDBLinks` option to migrate all Oracle database links.
-   On EDB Postgres Advanced Server, use the `-copyViaDBLinkOra` option to enable the `dblink_ora` module.

**Object Migration Support**

Migration Toolkit migrates object definitions (DDL), table data, or both. The following table contains a platform-specific list of the types of database objects that Migration Toolkit can migrate:

**Online Migration vs. Offline Migration**

Migration Toolkit can migrate immediately and directly into a Postgres database (*online* *migration*), or you can also choose to generate scripts to use at a later time to recreate object definitions in a Postgres database (*offline* *migration*).

By default, Migration Toolkit creates objects directly into a Postgres database; in contrast, include the -offlineMigration option to generate SQL scripts you can use at a later time to reproduce the migrated objects or data in a new database. You can alter migrated objects by customizing the migration scripts generated by Migration Toolkit before you execute them. With the -offlineMigration option, you can schedule the actual migration at a time that best suits your system load.

For more information about the `-offlineMigration` option, see [Offline Migration Options](08_mtk_command_options/#offline_migration).
