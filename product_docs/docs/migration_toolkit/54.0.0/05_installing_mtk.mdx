## Installing Migration Toolkit on a CentOS or RHEL 7 and 8 Host

You can use an RPM package to install Migration Toolkit on a CentOS or RHEL host. The following steps provide detailed information about accessing the EnterpriseDB repository and installing Migration Toolkit.

**Creating a Repository Configuration File**

1.  To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

-   On RHEL or CentOs 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/
    edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

-   On RHEL or CentOs 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/
    edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

    The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

2.  After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to ensure that the value of the `enabled` parameter is `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

    ```text
    [edb]
    name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
    baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/
    edb/
    redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
    ```

3.  After saving your changes to the configuration file, install the EPEL repository:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/
    epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

-   On RHEL or Centos 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/
    epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
    ```

4.  If you are using RHEL or CentOS 8.x, you must enable an additional repository to resolve dependencies:

-   On CentOS 8 (Powertools repo):

    ```text
    dnf config-manager --set-enabled PowerTools
    ```

-   On RHEL 8 (codeready-builder-for-rhel-8- \* -rpms repo):

    ```text
    ARCH=$( /bin/arch )
    subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for
    -rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"
    ```

**Installing Migration Toolkit**

-   On RHEL or CentOs 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-migrationtoolkit
    ```

-   On RHEL or CentOs 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install edb-migrationtoolkit
    ```

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter a `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

After installing Migration Toolkit, you must configure the installation. Perform the following steps before invoking Migration Toolkit.

**Using Migration Toolkit with IDENT Authentication**

By default, the `pg_hba.conf` file for the RPM installer enforces `IDENT` authentication for remote clients. Before invoking Migration Toolkit, you must either modify the `pg_hba.conf` file, changing the authentication method to a form other than `IDENT` (and restarting the server), or perform the following steps to ensure that an `IDENT` server is accessible:

1.  Confirm that an `identd` server is installed and running. You can use the yum package manager to install an `identd` server by invoking the command:

       `yum install xinetd authd`

       The command should create a file named `/etc/xinetd.d/auth` that contains:

    ```text
    service auth
    {
    disable       = yes
    socket_type   = stream
    wait          = no
    user          = ident
    cps           = 4096 10
    instances     = UNLIMITED
    server        = /usr/sbin/in.authd
    server_args   = -t60 --xerror --os
    }
    ```

    !!! Note
        If the file includes a `-E` argument at the end of `server_args`, please erase the `-E`.

    Then, to start the `identd` server, invoke the commands:

    ```text
    systemctl enable xinetd
    systemctl start xinetd
    ```

2.  Open the `pg_ident.conf` file and create a user mapping:

    ```text
    # map_name system_username postgres_username
    edbas enterprisedb enterprisedb
    ```

    Where:

    -   The name specified in the `map_name` column is a user-defined name that will identify the mapping in the pg_hba.conf file.
    -   The name specified in the `system_username` column is enterprisedb.
    -   The name specified in the `postgres_username` column is enterprisedb.

3.  Open the `pg_hba.conf` file and modify the `IDENT` entries.

    On an IPv4 host:

    `host all all 127.0.0.0/0 ident map=edbas`

    On an IPv6 host:

    `host all all ::1/128 ident map=edbas`

4.  Restart the EDB Postgres Advanced Server service before invoking Migration Toolkit.

### Upgrading an RPM Installation

If you have an existing RPM installation, you can use `yum` to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the edb.repo file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

```text
yum upgrade edb-repo
```

yum will update the edb.repo file to enable access to the current EnterpriseDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your edb.repo file. Then, you can use yum to upgrade Migration toolkit:

```text
yum upgrade edb-migrationtoolkit
```

<div id="rhel_centos_ppcle_installation" class="registered_link"></div>

## Installing Migration Toolkit on a CentOS, or RHEL 7 ppc64le Host

You can use an RPM package to install Migration Toolkit on a CentOS or RHEL ppc64le host.

Before installing Migration toolkit , you must:

1.  Create the Advance Toolchain repository configuration file; assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

    ```text
    rpm --import https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/
    Linux/toolchain/at/redhat/RHEL7/gpg-pubkey-6976a827-5164221b
    ```

2.  After creating the `advance-toolchain.repo` file, use your choice of editor to ensure that the value of the `enabled` parameter is `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

    ```text
    [advance-toolchain]
    name=Advance Toolchain IBM FTP
    baseurl=https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/
    Linux/toolchain/at/redhat/RHEL7
    failovermethod=priority
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/Linux/
    toolchain/at/redhat/RHELX/gpg-pubkey-6976a827-5164221b
    ```

The following steps provide detailed information about accessing the EnterpriseDB repository and installing Migration Toolkit.

**Creating a Repository Configuration File**

1.  To create the EDB repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/
    edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

    The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

2.  After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to ensure that the value of the `enabled` parameter is `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

    ```text
    [edb]
    name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
    baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/
    redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
    ```

3.  After saving your changes to the configuration file, install the EPEL package:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/
    epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

4.  If you are using RHEL 7 ppc64le, you must enable an additional repository to resolve dependencies:

    ```text
    subscription-manager repos --enable "rhel-*-optional-rpms"
    --enable "rhel-*-extras-rpms"  --enable "rhel-ha-for-rhel-*
    -server-rpms"
    ```

5.  To install Migration Toolkit, run the following command.

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-migrationtoolkit
    ```

<div id="debian_or_ubuntu_installation" class="registered_link"></div>

## Installing Migration Toolkit on a Debian or Ubuntu Host

To install a package with apt, complete the following steps. When invoking the commands, replace the `username` and `password` with the user credentials provided by EnterpriseDB.

1.  Assume superuser privileges:

    ```text
    sudo su –
    ```

2.  Configure the EnterpriseDB repository:

    -   On Debian 9, perform the following step to configure the EnterpriseDB repository:

        ```text
        sh -c 'echo "deb https://username:password@apt.
        enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release
        -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release
        -cs).list'
        ```

    -   On Debian 10, perform the following steps to configure the EnterpriseDB repository:

        a.  Set up the EnterpriseDB repository:

        ```text
        sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://
        apt.enterprisedb.com/
        $(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main"
        > /etc/
        apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
        ```

        b.  Substitute your EnterpriseDB credentials for the `username` and `password` placeholders in the following command:

        ```text
        sh -c 'echo "machine apt.enterprisedb.com login <username>
        password <password>" > /etc/apt/auth.conf.d/edb.conf'
        ```

        c.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

        ```

<div id="sles_installation" class="registered_link"></div>

## Installing Migration Toolkit on a SLES Host

You can use the zypper package manager to install a Migration toolkit on an SLES 12 host. zypper will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but requires access to specific repositories that are not hosted at EnterpriseDB.

1.  You must assume superuser privileges and stop any firewalls before installing Migration Toolkit. Then, use the following commands to add EnterpriseDB repositories to your system:

    ```text
    zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/
    edb-sles.repo
    ```

2.  The command creates the repository configuration files in the /etc/zypp/repos.d directory. Use the following command to refresh the metadata on your SLES host to include the EnterpriseDB repository:

    ```text
    zypper refresh
    ```

    When prompted, provide credentials for the repository; specify `a` to always trust the provided key and update the metadata to include the EnterpriseDB repository.

3.  You must also add SUSEConnect and the SUSE Package Hub extension to the SLES host, and register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories. Use the commands:

    ```text
    SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'

    SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.4/x86_64

    SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.4/x86_64
    ```

4.  Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories:

    ```text
    zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/
    Apache:/Modules/SLE_12_SP4/Apache:Modules.repo
    ```

5.  Use the following command to refresh the metadata:

    ```text
    zypper refresh
    ```

6.  Install OpenJDK (version 1.8) for Java based components:

    ```text
    zypper -n install java-1_8_0-openjdk
    ```

7.  Now you can use the zypper utility to install a Migration Toolkit:

    ```text
    zypper -n install edb-migrationtoolkit
    ```
