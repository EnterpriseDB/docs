!!! Note
    The Migration Toolkit has not been tested and does not officially support use with Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) and Exadata. However, Migration Toolkit may work when it is connected to a single persistent node. For more information, contact your EDB representative.

**Supported Operating Systems Versions**

-   Centos or RHEL or OL 7 and 8
-   CentOS or RHEL PPCLE 7
-   SLES 12 SP5
-   Debian 9 and 10
-   Ubuntu 18.04 and 20
-   Windows (64-bit), 2016, and 2019
-   Mac OS X 10.12+

!!! Note
    The ojdbc7.jar can cause large data migrations to be incomplete due to a limit on records over Integer.MAX_VALUE (2147483647) while fetching from the ResultSet. To avoid this issue, we recommend upgrading to ojdbc8.jar.
