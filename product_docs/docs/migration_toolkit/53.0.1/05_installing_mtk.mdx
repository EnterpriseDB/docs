## Installing Migration Toolkit on a CentOS or RHEL 6,7, and 8 host

You can use an RPM package to install Migration Toolkit on a CentOS or RHEL host.

After receiving your repository credentials you can:

1.  Create the repository configuration file.
2.  Modify the file, providing your user name and password.
3.  Install Migration Toolkit.

**Creating a Repository Configuration File**

To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

**On RHEL or CentOs 6 and 7**

`yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm`

**On RHEL or CentOs 8**

`dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm`

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to ensure that the value of the `enabled` parameter is `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

``` text
[edb]
name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```

After saving your changes to the configuration file, you can use the `yum install` command to install Migration Toolkit:

**On RHEL or CentOs 6 and 7**

`yum install edb-migrationtoolkit`

**On RHEL or CentOs 8**

`dnf install edb-migrationtoolkit`

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter a `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

After installing Migration Toolkit, you must configure the installation. Perform the following steps before invoking Migration Toolkit.



**Using Migration Toolkit with IDENT Authentication**

By default, the `pg_hba.conf` file for the RPM installer enforces `IDENT` authentication for remote clients. Before invoking Migration Toolkit, you must either modify the `pg_hba.conf` file, changing the authentication method to a form other than `IDENT` (and restarting the server), or perform the following steps to ensure that an `IDENT` server is accessible:

1.  Confirm that an `identd` server is installed and running. You can use the yum package manager to install an `identd` server by invoking the command:

    `yum install xinetd authd`

    The command should create a file named `/etc/xinetd.d/auth` that contains:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
service auth
{
disable = yes
socket_type = stream
wait = no
user = ident
cps = 4096 10
instances = UNLIMITED
server = /usr/sbin/in.authd
server_args = -t60 --xerror --os
}
```

**Note**: if the file includes a `-E` argument at the end of `server_args`, please erase the `-E`.

Then, to start the `identd` server, invoke the commands:

``` text
systemctl enable xinetd
systemctl start xinetd
```

2.  Open the `pg_ident.conf` file and create a user mapping:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
# map_name system_username postgres_username
edbas enterprisedb enterprisedb
```

Where:

The name specified in the `map_name` column is a user-defined name that will identify the mapping in the pg_hba.conf file.

The name specified in the `system_username` column is enterprisedb.

The name specified in the `postgres_username` column is enterprisedb.

3.  Open the `pg_hba.conf` file and modify the `IDENT` entries.

    > On an IPv4 host:
    >
    > `host all all 127.0.0.0/0 ident map=edbas`
    >
    > On an IPv6 host:
    >
    > `host all all ::1/128 ident map=edbas`

4.  Restart the Advanced Server service before invoking Migration Toolkit.

### Upgrading an RPM Installation

If you have an existing RPM installation, you can use `yum` to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the edb.repo file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

> `yum upgrade edb-repo`

yum will update the edb.repo file to enable access to the current EnterpriseDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your edb.repo file. Then, you can use yum to upgrade Migration toolkit:

> `yum upgrade edb-migrationtoolkit`

## Installing Migration Toolkit on a SLES Host

For detailed information about installing Advanced Server and supporting components on a SLES host, refer the [EDB Postgres Advanced Server Installation Guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/p/edb-postgres-advanced-server).

SLES packages are available at <https://zypp.enterprisedb.com>.

Before installing Migration Toolkit, you must also add SUSEConnect and the SUSE Package Hub extension to the SLES host and register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories. Use the commands:

`zypper install SUSEConnect`

`SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12/x86_64`

`SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12/x86_64`

For detailed information about registering a SUSE host, visit: <https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7016626>

The following sections provide information about the specific repositories that are not hosted by EnterpriseDB, but provides software that satisfies dependencies for each listed component. After adding repository access, you must use the zypper refresh command to process the repository content:

`zypper refresh`

**Java Components:**

<div class="note">

Note

</div>

Only OpenJDK (version 1.7) is supported on SLES hosts of Java components. Before using an RPM package to add Advanced Server or a supporting component that requires Java, use zypper to add supporting repository locations to your system.

</div>

Use the commands:

`zypper addrepo`

`https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo`

`zypper refresh`

Then, you can use the zypper utility to install Migration Toolkit:

`zypper install edb-migrationtoolkit`

## Installing Migration Toolkit on a Debian or Ubuntu Host

To install a Debian package using the EnterpriseDB apt, complete the following steps. In addition, when using the commands, replace the `username` and `password` with the credentials provided by EnterpriseDB.

1.  Assume superuser privileges:

`sudo su â€“`

2.  Configure the EnterpriseDB repository:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
sh -c 'echo "deb
https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -
cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" >
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
```

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

`apt-get install apt-transport-https`

4.  Add the EBD signing key:

`wget -q -O - https://username:password @apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add -`

5.  Update the repository metadata:

`apt-get update`

6.  Install Debian package:

`apt-get install edb-migrationtoolkit`
