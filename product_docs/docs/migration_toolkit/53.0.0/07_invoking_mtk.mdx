<div id="invoking_mtk" class="registered_link"></div>


After installing Migration Toolkit, and specifying connection properties for the source and target databases in the `toolkit.properties file <building_toolkit.properties_file>`, Migration Toolkit is ready to perform migrations.

The Migration Toolkit executable is named `runMTK.sh` on Linux systems and `runMTK.bat` on Windows systems. On a Linux system, the executable is located in:

> `/usr/edb/migrationtoolkit/bin`

On Windows, the executable is located in:

> `C:\Program Files\edb\mtk\bin`

**Note:** If the following error appears upon invoking the Migration Toolkit, check the file permissions of the toolkit.properties file.

    MTK-11015: The connection credentials file ../etc/toolkit.properties is
    not secure and accessible to group/others users. This file contains
    plain passwords and should be restricted to Migration Toolkit owner user
    only.

The operating system user account running the Migration Toolkit must be the owner of the toolkit.properties file with a minimum of read permission on the file. In addition, there must be no permissions of any kind for group and other users. The following is an example of the recommended file permissions where user enterprisedb is running the Migration Toolkit.

> `-rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 191 Aug 1 09:59 toolkit.properties`

**Importing Character Data with Embedded Binary Zeros (NULL characters)**

Migration Toolkit properly supports importation of a column with a value of NULL.

However, Migration Toolkit does not support importation of NULL character values (embedded binary zeros 0x00) with the JDBC connection protocol. If you are importing data that includes the NULL character, use the `-replaceNullChar` option to replace the NULL character with a single, non-NULL, replacement character.

**Note**:

> -   MTK implicitly replaces `NULL` characters with an empty string.
> -   The `-replaceNullChar` option does not work with `-copyViaDBLinkOra` option.

Once the data has been migrated, use a SQL statement to replace the character specified by `-replaceNullChar` with binary zeros.

## Migrating a Schema from Oracle

Unless specified in the command line, Migration Toolkit expects the source database to be Oracle and the target database to be Advanced Server. To migrate a complete schema on Linux, navigate to the executable and invoke the following command:

> `$ ./runMTK.sh <schema_name>`

To migrate a complete schema on Windows, navigate to the executable and invoke the following command:

> `> .\runMTK.bat <schema_name>`

Where:

`schema_name`

> `schema_name` is the name of the schema within the source database (specified in the toolkit.properties file) that you wish to migrate. You must include at least one `schema_name`.

**Note:** When the default database user of a migrated schema is automatically migrated, the custom profile of the default database user is also migrated if such a custom profile exists. A custom profile is a user-created profile. For example, custom profiles exclude Oracle profiles DEFAULT and MONITORING\_PROFILE.

You can migrate multiple schemas by following the command name with a comma-delimited list of schema names.

On Linux, execute the following command:

> `$ ./runMTK.sh <schema_name1>,<schema_name2>,<schema_name3>`

On Windows, execute the following command:

> `> .\runMTK.bat <schema_name1>,<schema_name2>,<schema_name3>`

## Migrating from a Non-Oracle Source Database

If you do not specify a source database type and a target database type, Postgres assumes the source database to be Oracle, and the target database to be Advanced Server.

To invoke Migration Toolkit, open a command window, navigate to the executable, and invoke the following command:

> `$ ./runMTK.sh -sourcedbtype <db_type> -targetdbtype <target_type> [options, …] schema_name;`

Where:

`-sourcedbtype source_type`

> `source_type` specifies the server type of the source database. `source_type` is case-insensitive. By default, `source_type` is oracle. `source_type` may be one of the following values:

| To migrate from: | Specify:                   |
|------------------|----------------------------|
| Oracle           | oracle (the default value) |
| MySQL            | mysql                      |
| SQL Server       | sqlserver                  |
| Sybase           | sybase                     |
| PostgreSQL       | postgres or postgresql     |
| Advanced Server  | enterprisedb               |

`-targetdbtype target_type`

> `target_type` specifies the server type of the target database. `target_type` is case-insensitive. By default, `target_type` is `enterprisedb`. `target_type` may be one of the following values:

| To migrate to:  | Specify:               |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| Advanced Server | enterprisedb           |
| PostgreSQL      | postgres or postgresql |

`schema_name`

> `schema_name` is the name of the schema within the source database (specified in the `toolkit.properties` file) that you wish to migrate. You must include at least one `schema_name`.

The following example migrates a schema (table definitions and table content) named `HR` from a MySQL database on a Linux system to an Advanced Server host. Note that the command includes the `‑sourcedbtype` and `-targetdbtype` options:

> `$ ./runMTK.sh -sourcedbtype mysql -targetdbtype enterprisedb HR`

On Windows, use the following command:

> `> .\runMTK.bat -sourcedbtype mysql -targetdbtype enterprisedb HR`

You can migrate multiple schemas from a source database by including a comma-delimited list of schemas at the end of the Migration Toolkit command. The following example migrates multiple schemas (named HR and ACCTG) from a MySQL database to a PostgreSQL database:

On Linux, use the following command to migrate multiple schemas from a MySQL database:

> `$ ./runMTK.sh -sourcedbtype mysql -targetdbtype postgres HR,ACCTG`

On Windows, use the following command form:

> `> .\runMTK.bat -sourcedbtype mysql -targetdbtype postgres HR,ACCTG`
