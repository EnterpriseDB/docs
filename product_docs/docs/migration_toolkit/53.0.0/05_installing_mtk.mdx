## Using an RPM Package to Install Migration Toolkit

You can use an RPM package to install Migration Toolkit on a 64-bit Linux host. Before installing Migration Toolkit, you must:

-   Install a Java environment (version 1.7.0 or later) on your Migration Toolkit host.
-   You must also have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

<https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf>

After receiving your repository credentials you can:

1.  Create the repository configuration file.
2.  Modify the file, providing your user name and password.
3.  Install Migration Toolkit.

**Creating a Repository Configuration File**

To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

`yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm`

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to ensure that the value of the `enabled` parameter is `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

    [edb]
    name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
    baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY

After saving your changes to the configuration file, you can use the `yum install` command to install Migration Toolkit:

`yum install edb-migrationtoolkit`

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter a `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

After installing Migration Toolkit, you must configure the installation. Perform the following steps before invoking Migration Toolkit.



**Using Migration Toolkit with IDENT Authentication**

By default, the `pg_hba.conf` file for the RPM installer enforces `IDENT` authentication for remote clients. Before invoking Migration Toolkit, you must either modify the `pg_hba.conf` file, changing the authentication method to a form other than `IDENT` (and restarting the server), or perform the following steps to ensure that an `IDENT` server is accessible:

1.  Confirm that an `identd` server is installed and running. You can use the yum package manager to install an `identd` server by invoking the command:

    `yum install xinetd authd`

    The command should create a file named `/etc/xinetd.d/auth` that contains:

<!-- -->

    service auth
    {
    disable = yes
    socket_type = stream
    wait = no
    user = ident
    cps = 4096 10
    instances = UNLIMITED
    server = /usr/sbin/in.authd
    server_args = -t60 --xerror --os
    }

**Note**: if the file includes a `-E` argument at the end of `server_args`, please erase the `-E`.

Then, to start the `identd` server, invoke the commands:

    systemctl enable xinetd
    systemctl start xinetd

1.  Open the `pg_ident.conf` file and create a user mapping:

<!-- -->

    # map_name system_username postgres_username
    edbas enterprisedb enterprisedb

Where:

The name specified in the `map_name` column is a user-defined name that will identify the mapping in the pg\_hba.conf file.

The name specified in the `system_username` column is enterprisedb.

The name specified in the `postgres_username` column is enterprisedb.

1.  Open the `pg_hba.conf` file and modify the `IDENT` entries.

    > On an IPv4 host:
    >
    > `host all all 127.0.0.0/0 ident map=edbas`
    >
    > On an IPv6 host:
    >
    > `host all all ::1/128 ident map=edbas`

2.  Restart the Advanced Server service before invoking Migration Toolkit.

## Using Stack Builder to Install Migration Toolkit

Please Note: This guide uses the term Stack Builder to refer to *either* StackBuilder Plus (distributed with Advanced Server) or Stack Builder (distributed with the PostgreSQL one-click installer from EnterpriseDB).

Please note that you must have a Java JVM (version 1.7.0 or later) in place before Stack Builder can perform a Migration Toolkit installation. Free downloads of Java installers and installation instructions are available at:

<http://www.java.com/en/download/index.jsp>

The Java executable must be in your search path (`%PATH%` on Windows, `$PATH` on Linux/Unix). Use the following commands to set the search path (substituting the name of the directory that holds the Java executable for *javadir*):

> On Windows, use the command:
>
> `SET PATH=\ *javadir*;%PATH%`
>
> On Linux, use the command:
>
> `PATH=\ *javadir*:$PATH`

After setting the search path, you can use the Stack Builder installation wizard to install Migration Toolkit into either Advanced Server or PostgreSQL.

**Launching StackBuilder Plus from Advanced Server**

To launch StackBuilder Plus from an existing Advanced Server installation, navigate through the `Start` (or `Applications`) menu to the EDB Postgres menu; open the `EDB Add-ons` menu, and select the `StackBuilder Plus` menu option.

**Launching Stack Builder from PostgreSQL**

To launch Stack Builder from a PostgreSQL installation, navigate through the `Start` (or `Applications`) menu to the PostgreSQL menu, and select the `Application StackBuilder Plus` menu option.
