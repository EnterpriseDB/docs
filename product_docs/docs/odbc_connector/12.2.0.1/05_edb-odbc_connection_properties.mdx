title: "EDB-ODBC Connection Properties"
---



The following table describes the connection properties that you can specify through the dialogs in the graphical connection manager tools, or in the `odbc.ini` file that defines a named data source. The columns identify the connection property (as it appears in the ODBC Administrator dialogs), the corresponding keyword (as it appears in the `odbc.ini` file), the default value of the property, and a description of the connection property.

## Adding a Data Source Definition in Windows



The Windows ODBC `Data Source Administrator` is a graphical interface that creates named data sources. You can open the `ODBC Data Source Administrator` by navigating to the `Control Panel`, opening the `Administrative Tools` menu, and double-clicking the appropriate `ODBC Data Sources` icon (`32- or 64- bit`).

![*The Windows Data Source Administrator*](images/windows_data_source_administrator.png)

Click the `Add` button to open the `Create New Data Source` dialog. Choose `EnterpriseDB (ANSI)` or `EnterpriseDB (UNICODE)` from the list of drivers and click `Finish`.

![*The Create New Data Source dialog*](images/create_new_data_source.png)

The EnterpriseDB ODBC Driver dialog opens.

![*Define the data source*](images/define_the_data_source.png)

Use the fields on the dialog to define the named data source:

-   Enter the Database name in the `Database` field.
-   Enter the host name or IP address of Advanced Server in the `Server` field.
-   Enter the name of a user in the `User Name` field.
-   Enter a descriptive name for the named data source in the `Description` field.
-   If libpq is installed in the same directory as the EDB-ODBC driver, the drop-down listbox next to the `SSL Mode` label will be active, allowing you to use SSL and other Advanced Server utilities.
-   Accept the default port number (5444), or enter an alternative number in the `Port` field.
-   Enter the password of the user in the `Password` field.

Use the `Datasource` button (located in the `Options` box) to open the `Advanced Options` dialog and specify connection properties.

The `Global` button opens a dialog on which you can specify logging options for the EDB-ODBC driver (not the data source, but the driver itself).

![*Page 1 of the Advanced Options dialog*](images/advanced_options_1.png)

-   Check the box next to `Disable Genetic Optimizer` to disable the genetic query optimizer. By default, the query optimizer is `on`.
-   Check the box next to `KSQO (Keyset Query Optimization)` to enable server-side support for keyset queries. By default, `Keyset Query Optimization` is `on`.
-   Check the box next to `Recognize Unique Indexes` to force the `SQLStatistics()` function to report unique indexes; if the option is not checked, the `SQLStatistics()` function will report that all indexes allow duplicate values. By default, `Recognize Unique Indexes` is `on`.
-   Check the box next to `Use Declare/Fetch` to specify that the driver should use server-side cursors whenever your application executes a `SELECT` command. By default, `Use Declare/Fetch` is `off`.
-   Check the box next to `CommLog (C:\psqlodbc_xxxx.log)` to record all client/server traffic in a log file. By default, logging is `off`.
-   Check the box next to `Parse Statements` to specify that the driver (rather than the server) should attempt to parse simple `SELECT` statements when you call the `SQLNumResultCols()`, `SQLDescribeCol()`, or `SQLColAttributes()` function. By default, this option is `off`.
-   Check the box next to `Cancel as FreeStmt (Exp)` to specify that the `SQLCancel()` function should call `SQLFreeStmt(SQLClose)` on your behalf. By default, this option is `off`.
-   Check the box next to `MyLog (C:\mylog_xxxx.log)` to record a detailed record of driver activity in a log file. The log file is named `c:\mylog\_\ *process-id*.log`. By default, logging is `off`.

The radio buttons in the Unknown Sizes box specify how the `SQLDescribeCol()` and `SQLColAttributes()` functions compute the size of a column of unknown type (see Section `Supported Data Types` for a list of known data types).

-   Choose the button next to `Maximum` to specify that the driver report the maximum size allowed for a `VARCHAR` or `LONGVARCHAR` (dependent on the `Unknowns as LongVarChar` setting). If `Unknowns as LongVarChar` is enabled, the driver returns the maximum size of a `LONGVARCHAR` (specified in the `Max LongVarChar` field in the `Miscellaneous` box). If `Unknowns as LongVarChar` is not enabled, the driver returns the size specified in the `Max VarChar` field (in the `Miscellaneous` box).
-   Choose the button next to `Don’t know` to specify that the driver report a length of "unknown".
-   Choose the button next to `Longest` to specify that the driver search the result set and report the longest value found. (Note: you should not specify `Longest` if `UseDeclareFetch` is enabled.)

The properties in the `Data Type Options` box determine how the driver treats columns of specific types:

-   Check the box next to `Text as LongVarChar` to treat `TEXT` values as if they are of type `SQL_LONGVARCHAR`. If the box is not checked, the driver will treat `TEXT` values as `SQL_VARCHAR` values. By default, `TEXT` values are treated as `SQL_LONGVARCHAR` values.
-   Check the box next to `Unknowns as LongVarChar` to specify that the driver treat values of unknown type as `SQL_LONGVARCHAR` values. If unchecked, the driver will treat values of unknown type as `SQL_VARCHAR` values. By default, values of unknown type are treated as `SQL_VARCHAR` values.
-   Check the box next to `Bools as Char` to specify that the driver treat `BOOL` values as `SQL_CHAR` values. If unchecked, `BOOL` values are treated as `SQL_BIT` values. By default, `BOOL` values are treated as `SQL_CHAR` values.

You can specify values for some of the properties associated with the named data source in the fields in the `Miscellaneous` box:

-   Indicate the maximum length allowed for a `VARCHAR` value in the Max `VarChar` field. By default, this value is set to `255`.
-   Enter the maximum length allowed for a `LONGVARCHAR` value in the Max `LongVarChar` field. By default, this value is set to `8190`.
-   Specify the number of rows fetched by the driver (when `UseDeclareFetch` is enabled) in the `Cache Size` field. The default value is `100`.
-   Use the `SysTablePrefixes` field to specify a semi-colon delimited list of prefixes that indicate that a table is a system table. By default, the list contains `dd_`;.

You can reset the values on this dialog to their default settings by choosing the `Defaults` button.

Click the `Apply` button to apply any changes to the data source properties, or the `Cancel` button to exit the dialog without applying any changes. Choose the `OK` button to apply any changes to the dialog and exit.

Select the `Page 2` button (in the upper-left hand corner of the `Advanced Options` dialog) to access a second set of advanced options.

![*Page 2 of the Advanced Options dialog*](images/odbc_advanced_options_2.png)

-   Check the box next to `Read Only` to prevent the driver from executing the following commands: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `GRANT`, `REVOKE` or `LOCK`. Invoking the `Read Only` option also prevents any calls that use ODBC’s procedure call escape syntax (`call=procedure-name?`). By default, this option is `off`.
-   Check the box next to `Show System Tables` to include system tables in the result set of the `SQLTables()` function. If the option is enabled, the driver will include any table whose name starts with `pg\_` or any of the prefixes listed in the `SysTablePrefixes` field of `Page 1` of the `Advanced Options` dialog. By default, this option is `off`.
-   Check the box next to `Show sys/dbo Tables [Access]` to access objects in the `sys` schema and `dbo` schema through the ODBC data source. By default, this option is enabled (checked).
-   Check the box next to `Cumulative Row Count for Insert` to cause a single, cumulative row count to be returned for the entire array of parameter settings for an `INSERT` statement when a call to the `SQLRowCount()` method is performed. If this option is not enabled (the box is not checked), then an individual row count is available for each parameter setting in the array, and thus, a call to `SQLRowCount()` returns the count for the last inserted row.
-   Check the box next to `LF<->CR/LF` conversion to instruct the driver to convert line-feed characters to carriage-return/line-feed pairs when fetching character values from the server and convert carriage-return/line-feed pairs back to line-feed characters when sending character values to the server. By default, this option is enabled.
-   Check the box next to `Updatable Cursors` to specify that the driver should permit positioned `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations with the `SQLSetPos()` or `SQLBulkOperations()` functions. By default, this option is enabled.
-   Check the box next to `bytea as LO` to specify that the driver should treat `BYTEA` values as if they are `SQL_LONGVARBINARY` values. If the box is not checked, EDB-ODBC will treat `BYTEA` values as if they are `SQL_VARBINARY` values. By default, `BYTEA` values are treated as `SQL_VARBINARY` values.
-   Check the box next to `Row Versioning` to include the `xmin` column when reporting the columns in a table. The `xmin` column is the ID of the transaction that created the row. You must use row versioning if you plan to create cursors where `SQL_CONCURRENCY = SQL_CONCUR_ROWVER`. By default, `Row Versioning` is `off`.
-   Check the box next to `Disallow Premature` to specify that the driver should retrieve meta-data about a query (i.e., the number of columns in a result set, or the column types) without actually executing the query. If this option is not specified, the driver executes the query when you request meta-data about the query. By default, `Disallow Premature` is off.
-   Check the box next to `True is -1` to tell the driver to return `BOOL` values of `True` as a `-1`. If this option is not enabled, the driver will return `BOOL` values of `True` as `1`. The driver always returns `BOOL` values of `False` as `0`.
-   Check the box next to `Server side prepare` to tell the driver to use the `PREPARE` and `EXECUTE` commands to implement the `Prepare/Execute` model. By default, this box is checked.
-   Check the box next to `use gssapi for GSS request` to instruct the driver to send a GSSAPI connection request to the server.
-   Enter the database system (either `EnterpriseDB` or `PostgreSQL`) in the `dbms_name` field. The value entered here is returned in the `SQL_DBMS_NAME` argument when the `SQLGetInfo()` function is called. The default is `EnterpriseDB`.

Use the radio buttons in the `Int8` As box to specify how the driver should return `BIGINT` values to the client. Select the radio button next to `default` to specify the default type of `NUMERIC` if the client is MS Jet, `BIGINT` if the client is any other ODBC client. You can optionally specify that the driver return `BIGINT` values as a `bigint (SQL_BIGINT)`, `numeric (SQL_NUMERIC)`, `varchar (SQL_VARCHAR)`, `double (SQL_DOUBLE)`, or `int4 (SQL_INTEGER)`.

The default value of the `Extra Opts` field is `0x0`. `Extra Opts` may be:

| Option | Specifies                                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 0x1    | Forces the output of short-length formatted connection string. Select this option when you are using the MFC CDatabase class.                                              |
| 0x2    | Allows MS Access to recognize PostgreSQL's serial type as AutoNumber type.                                                                                                 |
| 0x4    | Return ANSI character types for the inquiries from applications. Select this option for applications that have difficulty handling Unicode data.                           |
| 0x8    | If set, NULL dates are reported as empty strings and empty strings are interpreted as NULL dates on input.                                                                 |
| 0x10   | Determines if SQLGetInfo returns information about all tables, or only accessible tables. If set, only information is returned for accessible tables.                      |
| 0x20   | If set, each SQL command is processed in a separate network round-trip, otherwise, SQL commands are grouped into as few round-trips as possible to reduce network latency. |

The `Protocol` box contains radio buttons that tell the driver to interact with the server using a specific front-end/back-end protocol version. By default, the `Protocol` selected is `7.4+`; you can optionally select from versions `6.4+`, `6.3` or `6.2`.

The `Level of Rollback on errors` box contains radio buttons that specify how the driver handles error handling:

| Option      | Specifies                                                                                                                  |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Transaction | If the driver encounters an error, it will rollback the current transaction.                                               |
| Statement   | If the driver encounters an error, it will rollback the current statement.                                                 |
| Nop         | If the driver encounters an error, you must manually rollback the current transaction before the application can continue. |

The `OID Options` box contains options that control the way the driver exposes the OID column contained in some tables:

-   Check the box next to `Show Column` to include the `OID` column in the result set of the `SQLColumns()` function. If this box is not checked, the `OID` column is hidden from `SQLColumns()`.
-   Check the box next to `Fake Columns` to specify that the `SQLStatistics()` function should report that a unique index exists on each `OID` column.

Use the `Connect Settings` field to specify a list of parameter assignments that the driver will use when opening this connection. Any configuration parameter that you can modify with a `SET` statement can be included in the semi-colon delimited list. For example:

`set search_path to company1,public;`

When you’ve defined the connection properties for the named data source, click the `Apply` button to apply the options; you can optionally exit without saving any options by choosing `Cancel`. Select the `OK` button to save the options and exit.

Choose the `Global` button (on the `EnterpriseDB ODBC Driver` dialog) to open the `Global Settings` dialog. The options on this dialog control logging options for the EDB-ODBC driver. Use this dialog to enforce logging when the driver is used without a named data source, or for logging driver operations that occur before the connection string is parsed.

![*The Global Settings dialog*](images/global_settings.png)

-   Check the box next to the `CommLog` field to record all client/server traffic in a log file. The logfile is named `C:\psqlodbc_process-id` where `process-id` is the name of the process in use.
-   Check the box next to the `Mylog` field to keep a logfile of the driver’s activity. The logfile is named `c:\mylog_process-id` where `process-id` is the name of the process in use.
-   Specify a location for the logfiles in the `Folder for logging` field.

When you’ve entered the connection information for the named data source, click the `Test` button to verify that the driver manager can connect to the defined data source.

![*The Connection is successful*](images/connection_is_successful.png)

Click the OK button to exit `Connection Test` dialog. If the connection is successful, click the `Save` button to save the named data source. If there are problems establishing a connection, adjust the parameters and test again.

## Adding a Data Source Definition in Linux



The Linux `ODBC Administrator` is a graphical tool that is distributed with unixODBC; you can use the `ODBC Administrator` to manage ODBC drivers and named resources. To add the ODBC Administrator to your system, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

> `yum install unixODBC`

followed by:

> `yum install unixODBC-kde`

To invoke the `ODBC Administrator`, open a terminal window and enter ODBCConfig.

![*The unixODBC Data Source Administrator*](images/unixodbc_data_source_administrator.png)

When you install the Advanced Server `Connectors` component, the EDB-ODBC driver is added to the list of drivers in the ODBC Administrator. Click `Advanced`, and then select the `Drivers` tab to verify that the `enterprisedb` driver appears in the list.

![*The Drivers tab shows the installed EDB-ODBC driver*](images/installed_edb-odbc_driver.png)

If the EDB-ODBC driver does not appear in the list of drivers, you can add it using the `ODBC Administrator`. To add a driver definition, select the `Drivers` tab, and click `Add`. The `Driver Properties (new)` window opens, as shown below:

![*The Driver Properties window*](images/driver_properties_window.png)

Complete the `Driver Properties` window to register the EDB-ODBC driver with the driver manager:

-   Add a unique name for the driver to the `Name` field.

-   Add a driver description to the `Description` field.

-   Add the path to the location of the EDB-ODBC driver in the `Driver` field. By default, the complete path to the driver is:

    `/usr/edb/odbc/lib/edb-odbc.so`

-   Add the path to the location of the EDB-ODBC driver setup file in the `Setup` field. By default, the complete path to the driver setup file is:

    `/usr/edb/odbc/lib/libodbcedbS.so`

When you’ve described the driver properties for the EDB-ODBC driver, click `OK`. The ODBC Data Source Administrator window now includes the EDB-ODBC driver in the list of available ODBC drivers.

With the EDB-ODBC driver available to the driver manager, you can add a data source. Click the `Data Source` Names option in the left panel, and then choose the appropriate DSN tab for the type of data source name you would like to add:

-   Choose the `User` tab to add a named data source that is available only to the current user (the data source will be stored in `/user/.odbc.ini`).
-   Choose the `System` tab add a named data source that is available to all users. All system data sources are stored in a single file (usually `/etc/odbc.ini`).
-   Choose the `File` tab to add a named data source that is available to all users, but that is stored in a file of your choosing.

Select the appropriate tab and click `Add`. The `Create a New Data Source…` window opens, as shown below:

Select the EDB-ODBC driver from the list, and click `OK` to open the `Data Source Properties` window.

Complete the `Data Source Properties (new)` window, specifying the connection properties for the EDB-ODBC driver.

-   Enter the data source name in the `Name` field.
-   Enter a description of the named data source in the `Description` field.
-   The unixODBC driver includes a trace utility that records the sequence of calls made an ODBC application to a log file. Specify `Yes` in the `Trace` field to turn the trace utility on. Note that using the trace utility can slow down an application.
-   Use the `TraceFile` field to specify a file to receive information returned by the `Trace` utility.
-   Enter the name of the Advanced Server database in the `Database` field.
-   Enter the host name or IP address of Advanced Server in the `Servername` field.
-   Enter the name of a user in the `Username` field.
-   Enter the password for the user in the `Password` field.
-   Enter a port number (or accept the default value of `5444`) in the `Port` field.
-   Use the `Protocol` field to specify a front-end/back-end protocol version; the default value is `7.4`. You can optionally select from protocol versions `7.4`, `6.4`, `6.3` or `6.2`.
-   Use the `ReadOnly` field to specify `Yes` to prevent the driver from executing the following commands: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `GRANT`, `REVOKE` or `LOCK`. Enabling the `Read Only` option also prevents any calls that use the ODBC procedure call escape syntax (`call=procedure-name?`). By default, `ReadOnly` is set to `No`.
-   Use the `RowVersioning` field to specify `Yes` if the driver should include the `xmin` column when reporting the columns in a table. The `xmin` column is the ID of the transaction that created the row. You must use row versioning if you plan to create cursors where `SQL_CONCURRENCY = SQL_CONCUR_ROWVER`. By default, `Row Versioning` is set to `No`.
-   Use the `ShowSystemTables` field to specify `Yes` if the driver should include system tables in the result set of the `SQLTables()` function. By default, this field is set to `No`.
-   Use the `ShowOidColumn` field to specify `Yes` if the driver should include the `OID` column in the result set of the `SQLColumns()` function. If `ShowOidColumn` is set to `No`, the `OID` column is hidden from `SQLColumns()`. By default, this option is set to `No`.
-   Use the `FakeOidIndex` field to specify Yes if the `SQLStatistics()` function should report that a unique index exists on each `OID` column. This is useful when your application needs a unique identifier and your table doesn’t include one. The default value is `No`.
-   Use the `ConnSettings` field to specify a list of parameter assignments that the driver will use when opening this connection.

When you’ve defined the connection properties, click `OK`.

The new data source is added to the list of data source names:
