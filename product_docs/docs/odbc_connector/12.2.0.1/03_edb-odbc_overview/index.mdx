title: "EDB-ODBC Overview"
---



EDB-ODBC is an interface that allows an ODBC compliant client application to connect to an Advanced Server database. The EDB-ODBC connector allows an application that was designed to work with other databases to run on Advanced Server; EDB-ODBC provides a way for the client application to establish a connection, send queries and retrieve results from Advanced Server.

While EDB-ODBC provides a level of application portability, it should be noted that the portability is limited; EDB-ODBC provides a connection, but does not guarantee command compatibility. Commands that are acceptable in another database, may not work in Advanced Server.

The major components in a typical ODBC application are:

-   The client application - written in a language that has a binding for ODBC
-   The ODBC Administrator - handles named connections for Windows or Linux
-   The database specific ODBC driver - EDB-ODBC
-   The ODBC compliant server - EDB Postgres Advanced Server

Client applications can be written in any language that has a binding for ODBC; C, MS-Access, and C++ are just a few.
