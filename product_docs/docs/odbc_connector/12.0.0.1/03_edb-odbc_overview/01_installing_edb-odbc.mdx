title: "Installing EDB-ODBC"
---



The EDB-ODBC Connector is distributed and installed with the EDB Postgres Advanced Server graphical or RPM installer.

## Installing the Connector with an RPM Package



Before installing the ODBC connector, you must:

Install the `epel-release` package:

  - On RHEL or CentOS 7:
    
    > `yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm`

  - On RHEL or CentOS 8:
    
    > `dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm`

Note

</div>

You may need to enable the `[extras]` repository definition in the `CentOS-Base.repo` file (located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`).

</div>

You must also have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

> <https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/../images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf>

After receiving your repository credentials you can:

1.  Create the repository configuration file.
2.  Modify the file, providing your user name and password.
3.  Install `edb-odbc`.

**Creating a Repository Configuration File**

To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges, and invoke the following command:

  - On RHEL or CentOS 7:
    
    > `yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm`

  - On RHEL or CentOS 8:
    
    > `dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm`

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

**Modifying the file, providing your user name and password**

After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to ensure that the value of the enabled parameter is `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

``` text
[edb]
name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```

**Installing the ODBC Connector**

After saving your changes to the configuration file, you can use the `yum install` command to install the ODBC connector on RHEL or CentOS 7. For example, the following commands install the ODBC connector:

  - On RHEL or CentOS 7:
    
    > `yum install edb-odbc`
    > 
    > `yum install edb-odbc-devel`

  - On RHEL or CentOS 8:
    
    > `dnf install edb-odbc`
    > 
    > `dnf install edb-odbc-devel`

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

### Updating an RPM Installation

If you have an existing ODBC connector RPM installation, you can use yum or dnf to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the `edb.repo` file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

  - On RHEL or CentOS 7:
    
    > `yum upgrade edb-repo`

  - On RHEL or CentOS 8:
    
    > `dnf upgrade edb-repo`

yum or dnf will update the `edb.repo` file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your `edb.repo` file. Then, you can use yum or dnf to upgrade any installed packages:

  - On RHEL or CentOS 7:
    
    > `yum upgrade edb-odbc`
    > 
    > `yum upgrade edb-odbc-devel`

  - On RHEL or CentOS 8:
    
    > `dnf upgrade edb-odbc`
    > 
    > `dnf upgrade edb-odbc-devel`

## Installing the Connector on an SLES 12 Host



You can use the zypper package manager to install the connector on an SLES 12 host. Zypper will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but requires access to specific repositories that are not hosted at EnterpriseDB.

Before installing the connector, use the following commands to add EnterpriseDB repository configuration files to your SLES host:

`zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas12-sles.repo`  
`zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas-sles-tools.repo`  
`zypper addrepo  https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas-sles-dependencies.repo`

Each command creates a repository configuration file in the `/etc/zypp/repos.d directory`. The files are named:

  - `Edbas12suse.repo`
  - `edbasdependencies.repo`
  - `edbastools.repo`

After creating the repository configuration files, use the `zypper refresh` command to refresh the metadata on your SLES host to include the EnterpriseDB repositories:

``` text
/etc/zypp/repos.d # zypper refresh
Repository 'SLES12-12-0' is up to date.
Repository 'SLES12-Pool' is up to date.
Repository 'SLES12-Updates' is up to date.

```

When prompted for a `User Name` and `Password`, provide your connection credentials for the EnterpriseDB repository. If you need credentials, contact [EnterpriseDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request/).

Before installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server or supporting components, you must also add SUSEConnect and the SUSE Package Hub extension to the SLES host, and register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories. Use the commands:

`zypper install SUSEConnect`  
`SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12/x86_64`  
`SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12/x86_64`

For detailed information about registering a SUSE host, click [here](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7016626/).

Then, you can use the zypper utility to install the connector:

`zypper install edb-odbc`

`zypper install edb-odbc-devel`

## Installing a DEB Package on a Debian or Ubuntu Host





To install a DEB package on a Debian or Ubuntu host, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, click [here](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request/).

The following steps will walk you through on using the EnterpriseDB apt repository to install a DEB package. When using the commands, replace the `username` and `password` with the credentials provided by EnterpriseDB.

1.  Assume superuser privileges:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
sudo su â€“
```

2.  Configure the EnterpriseDB repository:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
sh -c 'echo "deb
https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release
-cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" >
/etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
```

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
apt-get install apt-transport-https
```

4.  Add the EBD signing key:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
wget -q -O - https://username:password
@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key \| apt-key add -
```

5.  Update the repository metadata:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
apt-get update
```

6.  Install DEB package:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
apt-get install edb-odbc

apt-get install edb-odbc-dev
```
