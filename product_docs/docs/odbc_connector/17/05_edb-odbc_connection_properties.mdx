title: "Connection properties"

---

The following table describes the connection properties that you can specify through the dialog boxes in the graphical connection manager tools or in the `odbc.ini` file that defines a named data source. The columns identify the connection property (as it appears in the ODBC Administrator dialogs), the corresponding keyword (as it appears in the `odbc.ini` file), the default value of the property, and a description of the connection property.

Select **Add** to open the Create New Data Source dialog box. Select **EnterpriseDB (ANSI)** or **EnterpriseDB (UNICODE)** from the list of drivers and select **Finish**.

Use the fields on the EnterpriseDB ODBC Driver dialog box to define the named data source:

-   Enter the database name in the **Database** field.
-   Enter the host name or IP address of EDB Postgres Advanced Server in the **Server** field.
-   Enter the name of a user in the **User Name** field.
-   Enter a descriptive name for the named data source in the **Description** field.
-   If libpq is installed in the same directory as the EDB-ODBC driver, the list next to the **SSL Mode** label is active, allowing you to use SSL and other EDB Postgres Advanced Server utilities.
-   Accept the default port number (5444), or enter an alternative number in the **Port** field.
-   Enter the password of the user in the **Password** field.

Select **Datasource** (located in the Options box) to open the Advanced Options dialog box and specify connection properties.

Select **Global** to open a dialog where you can specify logging options for the EDB-ODBC driver (not the data source, but the driver).

-   Select **Disable Genetic Optimizer** to disable the genetic query optimizer. By default, the query optimizer is on.
-   Select **KSQO (Keyset Query Optimization)** to enable server-side support for keyset queries. By default, **Keyset Query Optimization** is on.
-   Select **Recognize Unique Indexes** to force the `SQLStatistics()` function to report unique indexes. If the option is not selected, the `SQLStatistics()` function reports that all indexes allow duplicate values. By default, **Recognize Unique Indexes** is on.
-   Select **Use Declare/Fetch** to specify for the driver to use server-side cursors whenever your application executes a `SELECT` command. By default, **Use Declare/Fetch** is off.
-   Select **CommLog (C:\psqlodbc_xxxx.log)** to record all client/server traffic in a log file. By default, logging is off.
-   Select **Parse Statements** to specify for the driver (rather than the server) to attempt to parse simple `SELECT` statements when you call the `SQLNumResultCols()`, `SQLDescribeCol()`, or `SQLColAttributes()` function. By default, this option is off.
-   Select **Cancel as FreeStmt (Exp)** to specify for the `SQLCancel()` function to call `SQLFreeStmt(SQLClose)` on your behalf. By default, this option is off.
-   Select **MyLog (C:\mylog_xxxx.log)** to record a detailed record of driver activity in a log file. The log file is named `c:\mylog\_\ *process-id*.log`. By default, logging is off.

The radio buttons in the **Unknown Sizes** box specify how the `SQLDescribeCol()` and `SQLColAttributes()` functions compute the size of a column of unknown type. 

-   Select **Maximum** to specify for the driver to report the maximum size allowed for a `VARCHAR` or `LONGVARCHAR` (dependent on the **Unknowns as LongVarChar** setting). If **Unknowns as LongVarChar** is enabled, the driver returns the maximum size of a `LONGVARCHAR` (specified in the **Max LongVarChar** field in the **Miscellaneous** box). If **Unknowns as LongVarChar** is cleared, the driver returns the size specified in the **Max VarChar** field in the **Miscellaneous** box.
-   Select **Don’t know** to specify for the driver to report a length of **unknown**.
-   Select **Longest** to specify for the driver to search the result set and report the longest value found. Don't specify **Longest** if **UseDeclareFetch** is enabled.)

The properties in the **Data Type Options** box determine how the driver treats columns of specific types:

-   Select **Text as LongVarChar** to treat TEXT values as if they are of type `SQL_LONGVARCHAR`. If cleared, the driver treats TEXT values as `SQL_VARCHAR` values. By default, TEXT values are treated as `SQL_LONGVARCHAR` values.
-   Select **Unknowns as LongVarChar** to specify for the driver to treat values of unknown type as `SQL_LONGVARCHAR` values. If cleared, the driver treats values of unknown type as `SQL_VARCHAR` values. By default, values of unknown type are treated as `SQL_VARCHAR` values.
-   Select **Bools as Char** to specify for the driver to treat BOOL values as `SQL_CHAR` values. If cleared, BOOL values are treated as `SQL_BIT` values. By default, BOOL values are treated as `SQL_CHAR` values.

You can specify values for some of the properties associated with the named data source in the fields in the **Miscellaneous** box:

-   Indicate the maximum length allowed for a `VARCHAR` value in the **Max VarChar** field. By default, this value is set to `255`.
-   Enter the maximum length allowed for a `LONGVARCHAR` value in the **Max LongVarChar** field. By default, this value is set to `8190`.
-   Specify the number of rows fetched by the driver (when `UseDeclareFetch` is enabled) in the **Cache Size** field. The default value is `100`.
-   Use the **SysTablePrefixes** field to specify a semicolon-delimited list of prefixes that indicate that a table is a system table. By default, the list contains `dd_;`.

You can reset the values on this dialog box to their default settings by selecting **Defaults**.

Select **Apply** button to apply any changes to the data source properties. Select **OK** to apply any changes and exit.

Select **Page 2** (in the upper-left corner of the Advanced Options dialog box) to access a second set of advanced options.

-   Select **Read Only** to prevent the driver from executing the following commands: `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `CREATE`, `ALTER`, `DROP`, `GRANT`, `REVOKE` or `LOCK`. Invoking the **Read Only** option also prevents any calls that use ODBC’s procedure call escape syntax (`call=procedure-name?`). By default, this option is off.
-   Select **Show System Tables** to include system tables in the result set of the `SQLTables()` function. If the option is enabled, the driver includes any table whose name starts with `pg\_` or any of the prefixes listed in the **SysTablePrefixes** field of Page 1 of the Advanced Options dialog box. By default, this option is off.
-   Select **Show sys/dbo Tables [Access]** to access objects in the `sys` schema and `dbo` schema through the ODBC data source. By default, this option is on.
-   Select **Show sys/SQL Tables** to enable accessing database tables in a linked server with MS SQL.
-   Select **Cumulative Row Count for Insert** to cause a single, cumulative row count to be returned for the entire array of parameter settings for an `INSERT` statement when a call to the `SQLRowCount()` method is performed. If this option is cleared, then an individual row count is available for each parameter setting in the array and thus a call to `SQLRowCount()` returns the count for the last inserted row.
-   Select **LF<->CR/LF** conversion to instruct the driver to convert line-feed characters to carriage-return/line-feed pairs when fetching character values from the server and convert them back to line-feed characters when sending character values to the server. By default, this option is on.
-   Select **Updatable Cursors** to specify for the driver to permit positioned `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations with the `SQLSetPos()` or `SQLBulkOperations()` functions. By default, this option is on.
-   Select **bytea as LO** to specify for the driver to treat `BYTEA` values as if they're `SQL_LONGVARBINARY` values. If cleared, EDB-ODBC treats `BYTEA` values as if they are `SQL_VARBINARY` values. By default, `BYTEA` values are treated as `SQL_VARBINARY` values.
-   Select **Row Versioning** to include the `xmin` column when reporting the columns in a table. The `xmin` column is the ID of the transaction that created the row. You must use row versioning if you plan to create cursors where `SQL_CONCURRENCY = SQL_CONCUR_ROWVER`. By default, this option is off.
-   Select **Disallow Premature** to specify for the driver to retrieve metadata about a query (the number of columns in a result set or the column types) without actually executing the query. If this option is cleared, the driver executes the query when you request metadata about the query. By default, this option is off.
-   Select **True is -1** to tell the driver to return BOOL values of `True` as a `-1`. If this option is cleared, the driver returns BOOL values of `True` as `1`. The driver always returns BOOL values of `False` as `0`.
-   Select **Server side prepare** to tell the driver to use the `PREPARE` and `EXECUTE` commands to implement the `Prepare/Execute` model. By default, this option is on.
-   Select **use gssapi for GSS request** to instruct the driver to send a GSSAPI connection request to the server.
-   Enter the database system (either `EnterpriseDB` or `PostgreSQL`) in the **dbms_name** field. The value entered here is returned in the `SQL_DBMS_NAME` argument when the `SQLGetInfo()` function is called. The default is `EnterpriseDB`.

Use the options in the **Int8 As** box to specify how the driver returns `BIGINT` values to the client. Select **default** to specify the default type of **NUMERIC** if the client is MS Jet. Select **BIGINT** if the client is any other ODBC client. You can optionally specify for the driver to return `BIGINT` values as a `bigint (SQL_BIGINT)`, `numeric (SQL_NUMERIC)`, `varchar (SQL_VARCHAR)`, `double (SQL_DOUBLE)`, or `int4 (SQL_INTEGER)`.

The default value of the **Extra Opts** field is `0x0`. For **Extra Opts**, you can specify the options shown in the table.

| Option | Specifies                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 0x1    | Forces the output of short-length formatted connection string. Select this option when you're using the MFC CDatabase class.                                              |
| 0x2    | Allows MS Access to recognize PostgreSQL's serial type as AutoNumber type.                                                                                                 |
| 0x4    | Returns ANSI character types for the inquiries from applications. Select this option for applications that have difficulty handling Unicode data.                           |
| 0x8    | If set, NULL dates are reported as empty strings, and empty strings are interpreted as NULL dates on input.                                                                 |
| 0x10   | Determines if `SQLGetInfo` returns information about all tables or only accessible tables. If set, information is returned only for accessible tables.                      |
| 0x20   | If set, each SQL command is processed in a separate network round trip. Otherwise, SQL commands are grouped into as few round trips as possible to reduce network latency. |

The **Protocol** box contains options that tell the driver to interact with the server using a specific front-end/back-end protocol version. By default, the protocol selected is **7.4+**. You can optionally select from versions **6.4+**, **6.3**, or **6.2**.

The **Level of Rollback on Errors** box contains options that specify how the driver handles error handling.

| Option      | Specifies                                                                                                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transaction | If the driver encounters an error, it rolls back the current transaction.                                               |
| Statement   | If the driver encounters an error, it rolls back the current statement.                                                 |
| Nop         | If the driver encounters an error, you must manually roll back the current transaction before the application can continue. |

The **OID Options** box contains options that control the way the driver exposes the OID column contained in some tables:

-   Select **Show Column** to include the `OID` column in the result set of the `SQLColumns()` function. If cleared, the `OID` column is hidden from `SQLColumns()`.
-   Select **Fake Columns** to specify for the `SQLStatistics()` function to report that a unique index exists on each `OID` column.

Use the **Connect Settings** field to specify a list of parameter assignments for the driver to use when opening this connection. Any configuration parameter that you can modify with a `SET` statement can be included in the semicolon-delimited list. For example:

`set search_path to company1,public;`

After you define the connection properties for the named data source, select **Apply** to apply the options. Select **OK** to save the options and exit.

Select **Global** (on the EnterpriseDB ODBC Driver dialog box) to open the Global Settings dialog box. The options on this dialog box control logging options for the EDB-ODBC driver. Use this dialog box to enforce logging when the driver is used without a named data source or for logging driver operations that occur before the connection string is parsed.

-   Select **CommLog** to record all client/server traffic in a log file. The log file is named `C:\psqlodbc_<process-id>`, where `<process-id>` is the name of the process in use.
-   Select **Mylog** to keep a log file of the driver’s activity. The log file is named `c:\mylog_<process-id>`, where `<process-id>` is the name of the process in use.
-   Specify a location for the log files in the **Folder for logging** field.
After you entered the connection information for the named data source, select **Test** to verify that the driver manager can connect to the defined data source.

Select **OK** to exit the Connection Test dialog box. If the connection is successful, select **Save** to save the named data source. If there are problems establishing a connection, adjust the parameters and test again.

## Adding a data source definition in Linux

You can define named data sources on Linux in a text file that the driver manager reads to determine how to connect to the database. The driver manager usually looks for named data sources in two places:
- `/user/.odbc.ini` &mdash; Named data source that is available only to the current user.
- `/etc/odbc.ini` &mdash; Named data source that is available to all users.

There is no difference in the structure of these files and the same connection properties can be used in both files, only the location of the two files is different. If both files are available on a system, the user data source `/user/.odbc.ini` overrides the system data source `/etc/odbc.ini`.

A data source definition contains a data source name enclosed in square brackets and a list of driver and connection properties in the form of a property name followed by equal sign (=) followed by property value. 

A typical user or system data source definition for the EDB-ODBC driver:

```ini
[EnterpriseDB]
Description = EnterpriseDB DSN
Driver = /usr/edb/odbc/lib/edb-odbc.so
Trace = yes
TraceFile = /tmp/odbc.log
Database = edb
Servername = localhost
UserName = enterprisedb
Password = manager
Port = 5444
```

Possible properties include:

| Protocol         | Front-end/back-end protocol version. The default value is 7.4. You can optionally specify protocol versions 7.4, 6.4, 6.3, or 6.2.                                                                                                                                             |
| ReadOnly         | `Yes` prevents the driver from executing the following commands: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, CREATE, ALTER, DROP, GRANT, REVOKE, or LOCK. Also prevents any calls that use the ODBC procedure call escape syntax (`call=procedure-name?`). The default value is `No`.              |
| RowVersioning    | `Yes` includes the `xmin` column when reporting the columns in a table. The `xmin` column is the ID of the transaction that created the row. You must use row versioning if you plan to create cursors where `SQL_CONCURRENCY = SQL_CONCUR_ROWVER`. The default value is `No`. |
| ShowSystemTables | `Yes` includes system tables in the result set of the `SQLTables()` function. The default value is `No`.                                                                                                                                                                       |
| ShowOidColumn    | `Yes` includes the `OID` column in the result set of the `SQLColumns()` function. If `ShowOidColumn` is set to `No`, the `OID` column is hidden from `SQLColumns()`. The default value is `No`.                                                                                  |
| FakeOidIndex     | `Yes` specifies the `SQLStatistics()` function to report that a unique index exists on each `OID` column. This is useful when your application needs a unique identifier and your table doesn’t include one. The default value is `No`.                                        |
| ConnSettings     | List of parameter assignments for the driver to use when opening this connection.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
