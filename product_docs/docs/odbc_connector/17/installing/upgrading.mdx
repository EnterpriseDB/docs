## Upgrading from RPM or SLES installations

If you have an existing ODBC Connector installation on a Linux platform, you can upgrade your repository configuration file, which enables access to the current EDB repository. Then you can upgrade to a more recent version of ODBC Connector.

To update the `edb.repo` file:

```shell
# Update your repository configuration file
sudo <package-manager> upgrade edb-repo

# Upgrade the installed product
sudo <package-manager> upgrade edb-odbc

sudo <package-manager> upgrade edb-odbc-devel
```

Where `<package-manager>` is the package manager used with your operating system:

  | Package manager |         Operating system         |
  | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | dnf             | RHEL 8/9 and derivatives         |
  | zypper          | SLES                             |

## Upgrading from Debian/Ubuntu installations

If you are upgrading from an earlier Debian/Ubuntun installation, run the install command and specify the version number in the package name. For example:

```
sudo apt-get install edb-odbc=13.02.0000.02-1.bionic
```

If you get a message about downgrading, you can ignore it.
