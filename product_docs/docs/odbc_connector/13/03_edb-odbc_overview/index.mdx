title: "EDB ODBC Connector overview"

---

EDB ODBC Connector is an interface that allows an ODBC-compliant client application to connect to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server database. The EDB ODBC Connector allows an application that was designed to work with other databases to run on EDB Postgres Advanced Server. The ODBC Connector provides a way for the client application to establish a connection, send queries, and retrieve results from EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

While ODBC Connector provides a level of application portability, the portability is limited. It provides a connection but doesn't guarantee command compatibility. Commands that are acceptable in another database might not work in EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

The major components in a typical ODBC application are:

-   The client application written in a language that has a binding for ODBC
-   The ODBC Administrator, which handles named connections for Windows or Linux
-   The database-specific ODBC driver (ODBC Connector)
-   The ODBC-compliant server (EDB Postgres Advanced Server)

You can write client applications in any language that has a binding for ODBC. C, MS-Access, and C++ are just a few.
