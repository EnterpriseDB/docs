You can use the EDB Connectors Installation wizard to add the ODBC connector to your system; the wizard is available at the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres/).

Download the installer, and then, right-click on the installer icon, and select `Run As Administrator` from the context menu.

When the `Language Selection` popup opens, select an installation language and click `OK` to continue to the `Setup` window (shown in Figure below).
