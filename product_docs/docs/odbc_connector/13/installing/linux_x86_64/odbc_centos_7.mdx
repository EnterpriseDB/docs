## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install Postgres on a host that the product can connect to using a connection string. It doesn't need to be on the same host. See:

  - [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/installing/)

  - [Installing PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Install the EPEL repository
  ```shell
  sudo yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo yum -y install edb-odbc
sudo yum -y install edb-odbc-devel
```
