EDB provides a graphical interactive installer for Windows. You can access it two ways:

- Download the graphical installer from the [Downloads page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres#connectors) and invoke the installer directly. See [Installing directly](#installing-directly).

- Use Stack Builder (with PostgreSQL) or StackBuilder Plus (with EDB Postgres Advanced Server) to download the EDB installer package and invoke the graphical installer.  See [Using Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus](#using-stack-builder-or-stackbuilder-plus).


## Installing directly

After downloading the graphical installer, to start the installation wizard, assume sufficient privileges (superuser or administrator) and double-click the installer icon. If prompted, provide a password.

In some versions of Windows, to invoke the installer with Administrator privileges, you need to right-click on the installer icon and select **Run as Administrator** from the context menu.

Proceed to [Using the graphical installer](#using-the-graphical-installer) in this topic.


## Using Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus

If you are using PostgreSQL, you can invoke the graphical installer with Stack Builder. See [Using Stack Builder](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/supported-open-source/postgresql/installer/03_using_stackbuilder/). 

If you are using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you can invoke the graphical installer with StackBuilder Plus. See [Using StackBuilder Plus](/epas/latest/epas_inst_windows/installing_advanced_server_with_the_interactive_installer/using_stackbuilder_plus/). 

1. In Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus, follow the prompts until you get to the module selection page.

   On the Welcome page, use the drop-down listbox to select the target server installation from the list of available servers. If your network requires you to use a proxy server to access the internet, select `Proxy servers` and specify a server; if you do not need to use a proxy server, click `Next` to proceed.

1. Expand the **Database Drivers** node and do one of the following:

   - In Stack Builder, select **pgODBC**. 

   - In StackBuilder Plus, select  **EnterpriseDB ODBC Connector**.

1. Proceed to [Using the graphical installer](#using-the-graphical-installer).
