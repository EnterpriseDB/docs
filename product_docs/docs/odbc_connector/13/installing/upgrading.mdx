## Upgrading from RPM installations

If you have an existing EDB ODBC connector RPM installation, you can use yum or dnf to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the `edb.repo` file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

     `yum upgrade edb-repo`

-   On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8:

     `dnf upgrade edb-repo`

yum or dnf will update the `edb.repo` file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your `edb.repo` file. Then, you can use yum or dnf to upgrade any installed packages:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

     `yum upgrade edb-odbc`

     `yum upgrade edb-odbc-devel`

-   On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8:

     `dnf upgrade edb-odbc`

     `dnf upgrade edb-odbc-devel`

## Upgrading from Debian/Ubuntu installations

If you are upgrading from an earlier Debian/Ubuntun installation, run the install command and specify the version number in the package name. For example:

```
sudo apt-get install edb-odbc=13.02.0000.02-1.bionic
```

If you get a message about downgrading, you can ignore it.
