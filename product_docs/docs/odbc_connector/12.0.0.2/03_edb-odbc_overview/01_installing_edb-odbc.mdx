The EDB ODBC Connector is distributed and installed with the EDB Postgres Advanced Server graphical or RPM installer.

## Installing the Connector with an RPM Package

### On RHEL 7

Before installing the ODBC connector, you must:

Install the epel-release package:

-  On RHEL or CentOS 7:
    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/
    epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```
-  On RHEL or CentOS 8:
    ```text
    dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/
    epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

!!! Note
    You may need to enable the `[extras]` repository definition in the CentOS-Base.repo file (located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`).

You must also have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

 <https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf>

After receiving your repository credentials you can:

1.  Create the repository configuration file.
2.  Modify the file, providing your user name and password.
3.  Install `edb-odbc`.

**Creating a Repository Configuration File**

To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges, and invoke the following command:

-  On RHEL or CentOS 7:

```text
yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
```

-  On RHEL or CentOS 8:

```text
dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

**Modifying the file, providing your user name and password**

After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to ensure that the value of the `enabled` parameter is `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EDB user.

```text
[edb]
name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```

**Installing ODBC Connector**

After saving your changes to the configuration file, use the following commands to install the ODBC Connector:

-  On RHEL or CentOS 7:

```text
yum install edb-odbc

yum install edb-odbc-devel
```

-  On RHEL or CentOS 8:

```text
dnf install edb-odbc

dnf install edb-odbc-devel
```

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

### Updating an RPM Installation

If you have an existing EDB ODBC connector RPM installation, you can use yum or dnf to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the `edb.repo` file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum upgrade edb-repo
    ```

-   On RHEL or CentOS 8:

    ```text
    dnf upgrade edb-repo
    ```

yum or dnf will update the `edb.repo` file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your `edb.repo` file. Then, you can use yum or dnf to upgrade any installed packages:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum upgrade edb-odbc

    yum upgrade edb-odbc-devel
    ```

-   On RHEL or CentOS 8:

    ```text
    dnf upgrade edb-odbc

    dnf upgrade edb-odbc-devel
    ```

## Installing the Connector on an SLES 12 Host

You can use the zypper package manager to install the connector on an SLES 12 host. zypper will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but requires access to specific repositories that are not hosted at EDB.

Before installing the connector, use the following commands to add EDB repository configuration files to your SLES host:

```txt
zypper addrepo
https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas12-sles.repo
zypper addrepo
https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas-sles-tools.repo
zypper addrepo
https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas-sles-dependencies.repo
```

Each command creates a repository configuration file in the `/etc/zypp/repos.d directory`. The files are named:

- `Edbas12suse.repo`
- `edbasdependencies.repo`
- `edbastools.repo`

After creating the repository configuration files, use the zypper refresh command to refresh the metadata on your SLES host to include the EDB repositories.

```txt
/etc/zypp/repos.d # zypper refresh
```

When prompted for a `User Name` and `Password`, provide your connection credentials for the EDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, visit [the EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

Before installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server or supporting components, you must also add SUSEConnect and the SUSE Package Hub extension to the SLES host, and register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories. Use the commands:

```txt
zypper install SUSEConnect  
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12/x86_64  
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12/x86_64
```

For detailed information about registering a SUSE host, visit the [SUSE website](https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7016626).

Then, you can use the zypper utility to install the connector:

```txt
zypper install edb-odbc

zypper install edb-odbc-devel
```

## Installing the Connector on a Debian or Ubuntu Host

To install a DEB package on a Debian or Ubuntu host, you must have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, visit the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request/).

The following steps will walk you through on using the EDB apt repository to install a DEB package. When using the commands, replace the `username` and `password` with the credentials provided by EDB.

1.  Assume superuser privileges:

    ```text
    sudo su –
    ```

2.  Configure the EDB repository:

    ```text
    sh -c 'echo "deb https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
    ```

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

    ```text
    apt-get install apt-transport-https
    ```

4.  Add the EDB signing key:

    ```text
    wget -q -O - https://<username>:<password>@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add -
    ```

5.  Update the repository metadata:

    ```text
    apt-get update
    ```

6.  Install DEB package:

    ```text
    apt-get install edb-odbc
    apt-get install edb-odbc-dev
    ```

## Using the Graphical Installer to Install the Connector

You can use the EDB Connectors Installation wizard to add the ODBC connector to your system; the wizard is available at the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres/).

Download the installer, and then, right-click on the installer icon, and select `Run As Administrator` from the context menu.

When the `Language Selection` popup opens, select an installation language and click `OK` to continue to the `Setup` window (shown in Figure below).
