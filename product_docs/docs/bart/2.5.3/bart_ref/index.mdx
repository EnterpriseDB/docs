This guide acts as a quick reference for BART subcommands and provides comprehensive examples of the following BART operations:

-   Performing a full backup of database servers
-   Performing a point-in-time recovery (PITR) on a remote PostgreSQL database server
-   Restoring an incremental backup
-   Restoring a database cluster with tablespaces
-   Evaluating, marking, and deleting backups and incremental backups
-   Local and remote database server configuration and operation

For detailed information about BART subcommands and operations, see the [EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery User Guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/).

The document is organized as follows:

-   See [Subcommands](01_bart_subcommands_examples/#using_bart_subcommands) for information and examples related to BART subcommands.
-   See [Examples](02_additional_examples/#examples) for sample BART operations.
-   See [Sample BART System](03_sample_bart_system_with_local_and_remote_database_servers/#a_sample_bart_system_with_local_and_remote_database_servers) to view examples of both local and remote database server configuration and operation.
