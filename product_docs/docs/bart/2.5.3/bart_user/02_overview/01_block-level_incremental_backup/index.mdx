This section describes the basic concepts of a block-level incremental backup (referred to as an incremental backup). An incremental backup is a unique functionality of BART.

An incremental backup provides a number of advantages when compared to using a full backup:

-   The amount of time required to produce an incremental backup is generally less than a full backup, as modified relation blocks are saved instead of all full relation files of the database cluster.
-   An incremental backup uses less disk space than a full backup.

Generally, all BART features (such as retention policy management) apply to incremental backups and full backups. See [Managing Incremental Backups](../04_using_bart/02_managing_backups_using_a_retention_policy/#managing_incremental_backups) for information.
