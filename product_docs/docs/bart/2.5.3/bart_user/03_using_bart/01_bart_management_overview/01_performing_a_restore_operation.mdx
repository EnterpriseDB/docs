The following steps describe the process of restoring a backup:

**Step 1:** Use your system-specific command to shut down the database server.

**Step 2:** Inspect the `pg_wal` subdirectory (inspect the `pg_xlog` subdirectory if you are using server 9.5 or 9.6 versions) of the data directory and save any WAL files that have not yet been archived to the `archive_path`. If there are files that have not been archived, save them to a temporary location.

**Step 3:** If you want to restore to current data directory, it is recommended to make a copy of the current data directory and then delete all files and subdirectories under the data directory if you have enough extra space. If there is not enough space, then make a copy of `pg_wal` directory (or `pg_xlog` if you are using server 9.5 or 9.6 versions) until the server is successfully restored.

If you want to restore to a new, empty directory, create the directory on which you want to restore the backed up database cluster. Ensure the data directory can be written to by the BART user account or by the user account specified by the `remote_host` configuration parameter, or by the `--remote-host` option of the `RESTORE` subcommand (if these are to be used).

**Step 4:** Perform the same process for tablespaces as described in Step 3. The `tablespace_path` parameter in the BART configuration file must contain the tablespace directory paths to which the tablespace data files are to be restored. See the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Installation and Upgrade Guide* for more information about this parameter.

**Step 5:** Identify the backup to use for the restore operation and obtain the backup ID or backup name.

To use the latest backup, omit the `-i` option; the `RESTORE` subcommand uses that backup by default. The backups can be listed with the `SHOW-BACKUPS` subcommand.

**Step 6:** Run the BART `RESTORE` subcommand.

-   Minimal recovery settings will be saved in the `postgresql.auto.conf` file and archive recovery will proceed only until consistency is reached, with no restoration of files from the archive. See [Restore](../../04_using_bart/03_basic_bart_subcommand_usage/#restore) for detailed information about `Restore` subcommand.

-   If the `-c` option is specified or if the `copy_wals_during_restore` BART configuration parameter is enabled for this database server, then the following actions occur:

    > -   In addition to restoring the database cluster to the directory specified by the `-p restore_path` option, the archived WAL files of the backup are copied from the BART backup catalog to the subdirectory `restore_path/archived_wals`.
    > -   If recovery settings are saved in the `postgresql.auto.conf` file, the command string set in the `restore_command` parameter retrieves the WAL files from this `archived_wals` subdirectory relative to the `restore_path` parent directory as: `restore_command = cp archived_wals/%f %p`

You must ensure that valid options are specified when using the `RESTORE` subcommand. BART will not generate an error message if invalid option values or invalid option combinations are provided. BART will accept the invalid options and pass them to the `postgresql.auto.conf` file, which will then be processed by the database server when it is restarted.

**Step 7:** Copy any saved WAL files from Step 2 to the `restore_path/pg_xlog` subdirectory.

**Step 8:** Inspect the restored directories and data files of the restored database cluster in directory `restore_path`.

All files and directories must be owned by the user account that you intend to use to start the database server. Recursively change the user and group ownership of the `restore_path` directory, its files, and its subdirectories if necessary. There must only be directory access privileges for the user account that will start the database server. No other groups or users can have access to the directory.

**Step 9:** The `postgresql.auto.conf` file should be configured to recover only until the cluster reaches consistency. In either case, the settings may be modified as desired.

**Step 10:** Disable WAL archiving at this point. The BART `RESTORE` subcommand adds `archive_mode = off` to the end of the `postgresql.conf` file.

-   If you want to restart the database server with WAL archiving enabled, ensure that this additional parameter is deleted.
-   The original `archive_mode` parameter still resides in the `postgresql.conf` file in its initial location with its last setting.

**Step 11:** Start the database server to initiate recovery. After completion, check the database server log file to ensure the recovery was successful.

If the backup is restored to a different location than where the original database cluster resided, operations dependent upon the database cluster location may fail if supporting service scripts are not updated to reflect the location where the backup has been restored. For information about the use and modification of service scripts, see the [EDB Postgres Advanced Server Installation Guide.](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/)

See [Restore](../../04_using_bart/03_basic_bart_subcommand_usage/#restore) for more information about using the BART `Restore` subcommand.

An example of a restore operation is documented in the [EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Reference Guide.](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/)
