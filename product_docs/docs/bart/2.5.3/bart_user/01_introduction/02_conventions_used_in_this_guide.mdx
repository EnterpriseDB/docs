<div id="conventions_used_in_this_guide" class="registered_link"></div>

The following is a list of conventions used throughout this document.

-   Much of the information in this document applies interchangeably to the PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server database systems. The term *Advanced Server* is used to refer to EDB Postgres Advanced Server. The term *Postgres* is used to generically refer to both PostgreSQL and Advanced Server. When a distinction needs to be made between these two database systems, the specific names, PostgreSQL or Advanced Server are used.

-   The installation directory of the PostgreSQL or Advanced Server products is referred to as `POSTGRES_INSTALL_HOME`:

    > -   For PostgreSQL Linux installations, this defaults to `/opt/PostgreSQL/x.x` for version 10 and earlier. For later versions, the installation directory is `/var/lib/pgsql/x`.
    > -   For Advanced Server Linux installations performed using the interactive installer for version 10 and earlier, this defaults to `/opt/PostgresPlus/x.xAS` or `/opt/edb/asx.x`. For Advanced Server Linux installations performed with an RPM package, this defaults to `/usr/ppas-x.x` or `/usr/edb/asx.x`. For Advanced Server Linux installations performed with an RPM package for version 11 or later, this defaults to `/usr/edb/asxx`.

## Restrictions on pg_basebackup

BART takes full backups using the `pg_basebackup` utility program under the following conditions:

-   The backup is taken on a standby server.
-   The `--with-pg_basebackup` option is specified with the `BACKUP` subcommand (see [Backup](../03_using_bart/03_basic_bart_subcommand_usage/03_backup/#backup)).
-   The number of thread count in effect is 1, and the `with-pg_basebackup` option is not specified with the `BACKUP` subcommand.
-   Database servers can only be backed up using `pg_basebackup` utility program of the same or later version than the database server version. For example, `pg_basebackup` version 9.5 can back up database server version 9.5, but it cannot back up database server version 9.6.

In the global section of the BART configuration file, the `pg_basebackup_path` parameter specifies the complete directory path to the `pg_basebackup` program. For information about the `pg_basebackup_path` parameter and the `thread_count`, see the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Installation and Upgrade Guide* available [at this page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/)

For information about `pg_basebackup`, see the [PostgreSQL Core Documentation](https://postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-pgbasebackup.html).
