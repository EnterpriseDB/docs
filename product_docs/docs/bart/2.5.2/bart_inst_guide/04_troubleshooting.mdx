This section provides a workaround for the following installation issue:

> `Yum cannot access a repository that contains epel-release`

If yum cannot access a repository that contains `epel-release`, you will get an error message:

> `No package epel available`.
>
> `Error: Nothing to do`

**Workaround:**

To fix this issue, you must download the `EPEL` rpm package and install it manually. To manually install `EPEL`:

1.  Download the rpm package.

2.  Assume the superuser privileges and navigate to the directory that contains the package.

3.  Install `EPEL` with the command:

    `yum install epel-release`
