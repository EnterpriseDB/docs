To uninstall BART, assume the identity of the `root` user and invoke the following command:

`yum remove edb-bart`

Uninstalling BART does not delete the backup files and archived WAL files that reside in the BART backup catalog. To permanently delete the backup files and archived WAL files in the BART backup catalog (`/opt/backup`), use one of the follwing commands:

-   `rm –rf /opt/backup`
-   BART `DELETE` subcommand

For information about the BART `DELETE` subcommand, refer the EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery User Guide available at:
