This section outlines the process of upgrading BART from an existing version to the latest version.

-   [Upgrading from BART 2.0](#upgrading-from-bart-20) describes the upgrade process from BART 2.0 to the latest version.
-   [Upgrading from BART older versions](#upgrading_from_older_versions_except_2_0_to_latest_versions_of_bart) describes the upgrade process from previous BART versions (except 2.0) to the latest version.

**Upgrade Restrictions**

The following restrictions apply with regard to previous BART versions.

-   When using the latest version of BART (for example 2.5.2), the BART backup catalog (as specified by the `backup_path` parameter of the BART configuration file) must not be the same directory that was used by the previous BART versions (for example 2.5.1) for their backup catalogs. New full backups and incremental backups taken using the latest BART version must be stored in a new BART backup catalog.
-   You can take incremental backups using the latest version (for example 2.5.2) only when the parent backup (full or incremental backup) has been taken with the latest version (for example 2.5.2).
-   Using the latest version (for example 2.5.2), you can restore incremental backups taken only with the latest version of BART (for example 2.5.2). However, using the latest version (for example 2.5.2) you can restore full backups that were taken with older versions (for example 2.5.1).

## Upgrading from older versions of BART (except 2.0) to the latest version

Perform the following steps to upgrade from older versions of BART (except 2.0) to the latest version:

**Step 1:** Assume the identity of the BART user account and invoke the following command to stop the BART 2.x WAL scanner program (`bart-scanner`):

> `bart-scanner STOP`

**Step 2:** As the `root` user, upgrade to the latest BART version with the `yum upgrade` command.

-   To upgrade the BART RPM package directly from the *EDB Yum Repository* website, specify only the package name:

    > `yum upgrade edb-bart`

    You can also use a downloaded RPM package file to upgrade. To use a downloaded BART RPM package file to upgrade, use the `yum` command, specifying the complete RPM package file name:

    > `yum upgrade edb-bart-2.5.x-x.rhel7.x86_64.rpm`

Ensure the `<backup_path>` parameter of the BART configuration file is set to a new directory and not to any existing BART 2.x backup catalog. New full backups and incremental backups taken using BART 2.5.x.x must be stored in a new BART backup catalog.

</div>

The `bart.cfg` configuration file is only required on the BART 2.5.x.x host from which you will invoke BART subcommands. BART does not require the `bart.cfg` file on hosts on which an incremental backup will be restored.

</div>

**Step 3:** Repeat the process described in this section to upgrade to BART 2.5.x.x on each remote hosts where an incremental backup will be restored.

For additional information about restoration of incremental backups on remote hosts, see the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery User Guide* available at:

> <https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/>

If the `bart --version` command returns an error stating the `PATH` is not available after switching from `root` user to another BART user account, adjust the setting of the `PATH` environment variable to include the location of the BART 2.5 executable (the `bin` subdirectory) in the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` files of the following user accounts:

-   The BART user account on the BART host. See [Configuring the BART host](03_configuration/#configuring-the-bart-host) for more information about BART user account.

-   The remote user account on the remote host to which incremental backups are to be restored. For details, see the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery User Guide* available at:

    > <https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/>

The `PATH` setting should be the same as set for BART 2.x since all versions use `/usr/edb/bart/bin`.

## Upgrading from BART 2.0

Perform the following steps to upgrade BART 2.0 to the latest version of BART:

**Step 1:** Install the latest version of BART; for details, see [Using an RPM Package to Install BART](02_installing_bart_using_an_rpm_package/#installing_bart_using_an_rpm_package).

**Step 2:** Save a copy of your BART 2.0 configuration file. The default location of the BART 2.0 configuration file is `/usr/edb/bart2.0/etc/bart.cfg`.

**Step 3:** Invoke the following command to remove BART 2.0:

> `yum remove edb-bart20`

**Step 4:** Place the BART 2.0 configuration file (`bart.cfg`) that you saved in Step 2 in the newly created `/usr/edb/bart/etc` directory. You can use many of the same configuration parameters for BART 2.5.x.x, but note that you must use a new directory for the BART backup catalog. A new set of full backups and incremental backups taken using BART 2.5.x.x must be stored in a new BART backup catalog.

To specify an alternative configuration file name or location, use the `-c` option with BART subcommands. For details, see the EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery User Guide available at:

> <https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/>

The `bart.cfg` configuration file is only required on the BART 2.5.x.x host from which you will invoke BART subcommands. BART does not require the `bart.cfg` file on hosts on which an incremental backup will be restored.

**Step 5:** Adjust the setting of the `PATH` environment variable to include the location of the BART 2.5.x.x executable (the `bin` subdirectory) in the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` files for the following user accounts:

-   The BART user account on the BART host. See [Configuring the BART host](03_configuration/#configuring-the-bart-host), Step 3 for more information.

-   The user account on the remote host to which incremental backups will be restored. For details, see the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery User Guide* available at:

    > <https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/>

**Step 6:** Perform the BART 2.5.x.x installation and BART 2.0 removal process on each remote host on which an incremental backup was restored using BART 2.0.
