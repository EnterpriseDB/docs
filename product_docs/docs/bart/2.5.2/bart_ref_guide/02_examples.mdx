This section lists examples of the following BART operations.

-   Restoring a database cluster with tablespaces.
-   Evaluating, marking, and deleting backups and incremental backups using redundancy and recovery window retention policy.
-   Restoring an incremental backup.

## Restoring a Database Cluster with Tablespaces

The following example illustrates taking a backup and restoring a database cluster on a remote host containing tablespaces. For detailed information regarding using tablespaces, see the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery User Guide* available at:

> <https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/>

On an Advanced Server database running on a remote host, the following tablespaces are created and used by two tables:

    edb=# CREATE TABLESPACE tblspc_1 LOCATION '/mnt/tablespace_1';
    CREATE TABLESPACE
    edb=# CREATE TABLESPACE tblspc_2 LOCATION '/mnt/tablespace_2';
    CREATE TABLESPACE
    edb=# \db
                 List of tablespaces
    Name        | Owner           | Location
    ------------+-----------------+-------------------
    pg_default  | enterprisedb    |
    pg_global   | enterprisedb    |
    tblspc_1    | enterprisedb    | /mnt/tablespace_1
    tblspc_2    | enterprisedb    | /mnt/tablespace_2
    (4 rows)

    edb=# CREATE TABLE tbl_tblspc_1 (c1 TEXT) TABLESPACE tblspc_1;
    CREATE TABLE
    edb=# CREATE TABLE tbl_tblspc_2 (c1 TEXT) TABLESPACE tblspc_2;
    CREATE TABLE
    edb=# \d tbl_tblspc_1
    Table "enterprisedb.tbl_tblspc_1"
    Column | Type | Modifiers
    -------+------+-----------
    c1     | text |
    Tablespace: "tblspc_1"

    edb=# \d tbl_tblspc_2
    Table "enterprisedb.tbl_tblspc_2"
    Column | Type | Modifiers
    -------+------+-----------
    c1     | text |
    Tablespace: "tblspc_2"

The following example shows the OIDs assigned to the tablespaces and the symbolic links to the tablespace directories:

    -bash-4.1$ pwd
    /opt/PostgresPlus/9.5AS/data/pg_tblspc
    -bash-4.1$ ls -l
    total 0
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 17 Nov 16 16:17 16587 ->/mnt/tablespace_1
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 17 Nov 16 16:17 16588 ->/mnt/tablespace_2

The BART configuration file contains the following settings. Note that the `tablespace_path` parameter does not have to be set at this point.

    [BART]
    bart_host= enterprisedb@192.168.2.22
    backup_path = /opt/backup
    pg_basebackup_path = /usr/edb/as11/bin/pg_basebackup
    logfile = /tmp/bart.log
    scanner_logfile = /tmp/bart_scanner.log

    [ACCTG]
    host = 192.168.2.24
    port = 5444
    user = repuser
    cluster_owner = enterprisedb
    remote_host = enterprisedb@192.168.2.24
    tablespace_path =
    description = "Accounting"

After the necessary configuration steps are performed to ensure BART manages the remote database server, a full backup is taken.

    -bash-4.1$ bart BACKUP -s acctg

    INFO: creating backup for server 'acctg'

Note in the output from the preceding example that checksums are generated for the tablespaces as well as the full backup.

Within the backup subdirectory `1447709811516` of the BART backup catalog, the tablespace data is stored with file names `16587.tar.gz` and `16588.tar.gz` as shown by the following example:

    -bash-4.1$ pwd
    /opt/backup/acctg
    -bash-4.1$ ls -l
    total 8
    drwx------ 2 enterprisedb enterprisedb 4096 Nov 16 16:36 1447709811516
    drwx------ 2 enterprisedb enterprisedb 4096 Nov 16 16:43 archived_wals
    -bash-4.1$ ls -l 1447709811516
    total 54536
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 19968 Nov 16 16:36 16587.tar
    -rw-rw-r-- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 19968 Nov 16 16:36 16588.tar

    -rw-rw-r-- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 55792640 Nov 16 16:36 base.tar

When you are ready to restore the backup, in addition to creating the directory to which the main database cluster is to be restored, prepare the directories to which the tablespaces are to be restored.

On the remote host, directories `/opt/restore_tblspc_1` and `/opt/restore_tblspc_2` are created and assigned the proper ownership and permissions as shown by the following example. The main database cluster is to be restored to `/opt/restore`.

    [root@localhost opt]# mkdir restore_tblspc_1
    [root@localhost opt]# chown enterprisedb restore_tblspc_1
    [root@localhost opt]# chgrp enterprisedb restore_tblspc_1
    [root@localhost opt]# chmod 700 restore_tblspc_1
    [root@localhost opt]# mkdir restore_tblspc_2
    [root@localhost opt]# chown enterprisedb restore_tblspc_2
    [root@localhost opt]# chgrp enterprisedb restore_tblspc_2
    [root@localhost opt]# chmod 700 restore_tblspc_2
    [root@localhost opt]# ls -l
    total 20
    drwxr-xr-x 3 root daemon 4096 Nov 10 15:38 PostgresPlus
    drwx------ 2 enterprisedb enterprisedb 4096 Nov 16 17:40 restore
    drwx------ 2 enterprisedb enterprisedb 4096 Nov 16 17:40

    drwx------ 2 enterprisedb enterprisedb 4096 Nov 16 17:41
    restore_tblspc_2
    drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 Nov 22 2013 rh

Set the `tablespace_path` parameter in the BART configuration file to specify the tablespace directories.

Also note that the remote host user and IP address are specified by the `remote_host` configuration parameter.

    [ACCTG]

    host = 192.168.2.24
    port = 5444
    user = repuser
    cluster_owner = enterprisedb
    remote_host = enterprisedb@192.168.2.24
    tablespace_path =
    16587=/opt/restore_tblspc_1;16588=/opt/restore_tblspc_2

    description = "Accounting"

The following example shows invocation of the `RESTORE` subcommand:

    -bash-4.1$ bart RESTORE -s acctg -i 1447709811516 -p /opt/restore
    INFO: restoring backup '1447709811516' of server 'acctg'
    INFO: restoring backup to enterprisedb@192.168.2.24:/opt/restore
    INFO: base backup restored
    INFO: archiving is disabled
    INFO: tablespace(s) restored

The following example shows the restored full backup including the restored tablespaces:

    bash-4.1$ pwd
    /opt
    -bash-4.1$ ls -l restore
    total 104
    -rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 206 Nov 16 16:36 backup_label.old

    total 4
    drwx------ 3 enterprisedb enterprisedb 4096 Nov 16 16:18
    PG_9.5_201306121

The symbolic links in the `pg_tblspc` subdirectory point to the restored directory location:

    bash-4.1$ pwd
    /opt/restore/pg_tblspc
    -bash-4.1$ ls -l
    total 0
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 21 Nov 16 17:42 16587 ->

    lrwxrwxrwx 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 21 Nov 16 17:42 16588 ->
    /opt/restore_tblspc_2

Queries within `psql` also show the restored tablespaces:

    edb=# \db

                 List of tablespaces
    Name        | Owner        |   Location
    ------------+--------------+-----------------------

    pg_global   | enterprisedb |
    tblspc_1    | enterprisedb | /opt/restore_tblspc_1
    tblspc_2    | enterprisedb | /opt/restore_tblspc_2

## Managing Backups

This section illustrates evaluating, marking, and deleting backups using the `MANAGE` subcommand with two examples â€“ the first for a redundancy retention policy and the second for a recovery window retention policy. For detailed information about the `MANAGE` subcommand, see the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery User Guide* available at:

> <https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/>

<div id="using_redundancy_retention_policy" class="registered_link"></div>

### Using a Redundancy Retention Policy

The following example uses a redundancy retention policy to evaluate, mark, and delete backups as shown by the following server configuration:

    [ACCTG]
    host = 127.0.0.1
    port = 5444
    user = enterprisedb
    archive_command = 'cp %p %a/%f'
    retention_policy = 3 BACKUPS
    description = "Accounting"

The following list is the set of backups. Note that the last backup in the list has been marked as `keep`.

    -bash-4.1$ bart SHOW-BACKUPS -s acctg
    SERVER NAME  BACKUP ID       BACKUP TIME               BACKUP SIZE   WAL(s) SIZE
    WAL FILES    STATUS

    1            keep

Invoke the `MANAGE` subcommand with the `-n` option to perform a dry run to observe which active backups would be changed to obsolete according to the retention policy:

    -bash-4.1$ bart MANAGE -s acctg -n
    INFO: processing server 'acctg', backup '1428768344061'
    INFO: processing server 'acctg', backup '1428684537299'

    INFO: 2 WAL file(s) marked obsolete
    INFO: processing server 'acctg', backup '1428355371389'

The dry run shows that backups `1428502049836` and `1428422324880` would be marked as `obsolete`.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

### Using a Recovery Window Retention Policy

This section illustrates the evaluation, marking, and deletion of backup using a recovery window retention policy. To use the recovery window retention policy, set the `retention_policy` parameter to the desired length of time for the recovery window.

This section provides examples of the following:

-   How to view the calculated recovery window.
-   How to evaluate, mark, and delete backup using a recovery window retention policy.

#### Viewing the Recovery Window

You can view the actual, calculated recovery window by invoking any of the following subcommands:

-   `MANAGE` subcommand in debug mode (along with the `-n` option).
-   `SHOW-SERVERS` subcommand.

##### Viewing the Recovery Window Using the Manage Subcommand

By invoking BART in debug mode and the `MANAGE` subcommand with the `-n` option, time length of the recovery window is calculated based on the `retention_policy` setting and the current date/time.

For example, using the following `retention_policy` settings:

    [ACCTG]

    host = 127.0.0.1
    port = 5444
    user = enterprisedb
    archive_command = 'cp %p %a/%f'
    retention_policy = 3 DAYS
    backup-name = acctg_%year-%month-%dayT%hour:%minute:%second
    description = "Accounting"

    [DEV]

    host = 127.0.0.1
    port = 5445
    user = enterprisedb
    archive_command = 'cp %p %a/%f'
    retention_policy = 3 WEEKS
    description = "Development"

    [HR]

    host = 127.0.0.1
    port = 5432
    user = postgres
    retention_policy = 3 MONTHS
    description = "Human Resources"

If the `MANAGE` subcommand is invoked in debug mode along with the `-n` option on 2015-04-17, the following results are displayed:

    -bash-4.1$ bart -d MANAGE -n
    DEBUG: Server: acctg, Now: 2015-04-17 16:34:03 EDT, RetentionWindow:
    259200 (secs) ==> 72 hour(s)
    DEBUG: Server: dev, Now: 2015-04-17 16:34:03 EDT, RetentionWindow:
    1814400 (secs) ==> 504 hour(s)
    DEBUG: Server: hr, Now: 2015-04-17 16:34:03 EDT, RetentionWindow:
    7776000 (secs) ==> 2160 hour(s)

For server `acctg`, 72 hours translates to a recovery window of 3 days.

For server `dev`, 504 hours translates to a recovery window of 21 days (3 weeks).

For server `hr`, 2160 hours translates to a recovery window of 90 days (3 months).

For a setting of `<max_number> MONTHS`, the calculated total number of days for the recovery window is dependent upon the actual number of days in the preceding months from the current date/time. Thus, `<max_number> MONTHS` is not always exactly equivalent to `<max_number> x 30 DAYS`. (For example, if the current date/time is in the month of March, a 1-month recovery window would be equivalent to only 28 days because the preceding month is February. Thus, for a current date of March 31, a 1-month recovery window would start on March 3.) However, the typical result is that the day of the month of the starting recovery window boundary will be the same day of the month of when the `MANAGE` subcommand is invoked.

##### Viewing the Recovery Window Using the Show-Servers Subcommand

This section provides example of viewing the recovery window using the `SHOW-SERVERS` subcommand, the `RETENTION POLICY` field displays the start of the recovery window.

In the following example, the recovery window retention policy setting considers the backups taken within a 3-day recovery window as the active backups.

    [ACCTG]
    host = 127.0.0.1
    port = 5444
    user = enterprisedb
    archive_command = 'cp %p %a/%f'
    retention_policy = 3 DAYS
    description = "Accounting"

The start of the 3-day recovery window displayed in the `RETENTION POLICY` field is `2015-04-07 14:57:36 EDT` when the `SHOW-SERVERS` subcommand is invoked on `2015-04-10`.

At this current point in time, backups taken on or after `2015-04-07 14:57:36 EDT` would be considered active. Backups taken prior to `2015-04-07 14:57:36 EDT` would be considered obsolete except for backups marked as `keep`.

#### Evaluating, Marking, and Deleting Backup Using a Recovery Window Retention Policy

The following example uses a recovery window retention policy to evaluate, mark, and delete backups as shown by the following server configuration:

    [DEV]
    host = 127.0.0.1
    port = 5445
    user = enterprisedb
    archive_command = 'cp %p %a/%f'
    retention_policy = 3 DAYS
    description = "Development"

The following is the current set of backups. Note that the last backup in the list has been marked as `keep`.

    -bash-4.1$ bart SHOW-BACKUPS -s dev
    SERVER NAME    BACKUP ID       BACKUP TIME               BACKUP SIZE   WAL(s) SIZE
    WAL FILES      STATUS
    dev            1428933278236   2015-04-13 09:54:40 EDT   5.65 MB       16.00 MB
    1              active
    dev            1428862187757   2015-04-12 14:09:50 EDT   5.65 MB       32.00 MB
    2              active
    dev            1428768351638   2015-04-11 12:05:54 EDT   5.65 MB       32.00 MB

    14             active
    dev            1428590536488   2015-04-09 10:42:18 EDT   5.65 MB       48.00 MB

    5              keep

The current date and time is `2015-04-13 16:46:35 EDT` as shown by the following:

    -bash-4.1$ date
    Mon Apr 13 16:46:35 EDT 2015

Thus, a 3-day recovery window would evaluate backups prior to `2015-04-10 16:46:35 EDT` as `obsolete` except for those marked as `keep`.

Invoke the `MANAGE` subcommand with the `-n` option to perform a dry run to observe which active backups would be changed to `obsolete` according to the retention policy.

    -bash-4.1$ bart MANAGE -s dev -n
    INFO: processing server 'dev', backup '1428933278236'
    INFO: processing server 'dev', backup '1428862187757'
    INFO: processing server 'dev', backup '1428768351638'

    INFO: 3 WAL file(s) marked obsolete
    INFO: 1 Unused WAL file(s) present
    INFO: processing server 'dev', backup '1428502171990'

The dry run shows that backups `1428684544008` and `1428590536488` would be marked as `obsolete`.

Also note that a dry run does not change the backup status. The two backups that would be considered obsolete are still marked as `active`:

    -bash-4.1$ bart SHOW-BACKUPS -s dev\
      SERVER NAME  BACKUP ID       BACKUP TIME               BACKUP SIZE   WAL(s) SIZE

## Managing Incremental Backups

> This section illustrates evaluating, marking, and deleting incremental backups using the `MANAGE` and `DELETE` subcommands with two examples â€“ the first for a redundancy retention policy and the second for a recovery window retention policy. For detailed information about the `MANAGE` and `DELETE` subcommands, as well as the redundancy retention and recovery window retention policy, see the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery User Guide* available at:

> > <https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/>

-   [Using a Redundancy Retention Policy](04_using_bart/02_managing_backups_using_a_retention_policy/#redundancy_retention_policy) provides an example of using the `MANAGE` and `DELETE` subcommands when a 3 backup redundancy retention policy is in effect.
-   [Using a Recovery Window Retention Policy](04_using_bart/02_managing_backups_using_a_retention_policy/#recovery_window_retention_policy) provides an example of using the `MANAGE` and `DELETE` subcommands when a 1-day recovery window retention policy is in effect.

### Using a Redundancy Retention Policy

The following examples show using the `MANAGE` and `DELETE` subcommands to evaluate, mark, and delete incremental backups when a 3 backup redundancy retention policy is in effect. This is shown by the following server configuration:

    [ACCTG]

    host = 192.168.2.24
    port = 5445
    user = enterprisedb
    cluster_owner = enterprisedb
    remote_host = enterprisedb@192.168.2.24
    allow_incremental_backups = enabled
    retention_policy = 3 BACKUPS
    description = "Accounting"

The following is the current set of backups. (In these examples, some columns have been omitted from the `SHOW-BACKUPS` output in order to display the relevant information in a more observable manner).

    -bash-4.2$ bart SHOW-BACKUPS -s acctg
    SERVER NAME  BACKUP ID       ... BACKUP PARENT   BACKUP TIME             ... STATUS
    acctg        1481749696905   ... 1481749673603   2016-12-14 16:08:17 EST ... active
    acctg        1481749673603   ... 1481749651927   2016-12-14 16:07:53 EST ... active
    acctg        1481749651927   ... 1481749619582   2016-12-14 16:07:32 EST ... active
    acctg        1481749619582   ... none            2016-12-14 16:07:00 EST ... active

There is one backup chain. The first backup is the initial full backup.

Backup chain: `1481749619582 => 1481749651927 => 1481749673603 => 1481749696905`

The `MANAGE` subcommand is invoked as shown by the following:

    -bash-4.2$ bart MANAGE -s acctg
    INFO: processing server 'acctg', backup '1481749619582'
    INFO: 2 Unused WAL file(s) present
    INFO: 4 Unused file(s) (WALs included) present, use 'MANAGE -l' for the
    list

The following example shows the resulting status of the backups:

    -bash-4.2$ bart SHOW-BACKUPS -s acctg
    SERVER NAME    BACKUP ID     ... BACKUP PARENT   BACKUP TIME             ... STATUS
    acctg          1481749696905 ... 1481749673603   2016-12-14 16:08:17 EST ... active
    acctg          1481749673603 ... 1481749651927   2016-12-14 16:07:53 EST ... active
    acctg          1481749651927 ... 1481749619582   2016-12-14 16:07:32 EST ... active
    acctg          1481749619582 ... none            2016-12-14 16:07:00 EST ... active

The status remains active for all backups. Even though the total number of backups exceeds the 3 backup redundancy retention policy, it is only the total number of full backups that is used to determine if the redundancy retention policy has been exceeded.

Additional full backups are added including a second backup chain. The following example shows the resulting list of backups:

    -bash-4.2$ bart SHOW-BACKUPS -s acctg
    SERVER NAME  BACKUP ID     ... BACKUP PARENT     BACKUP TIME             ... STATUS
    acctg        1481750365397 ... none              2016-12-14 16:19:26 EST ... active

Second backup chain: `1481749997807 => 1481750098924`

The `MANAGE` subcommand is invoked, but now with a total of four active full backups.

    -bash-4.2$ bart MANAGE -s acctg

Invoking the `MANAGE` subcommand with the `-d` option deletes the entire obsolete backup chain.

    -bash-4.2$ bart MANAGE -s acctg -d

### Using a Recovery Window Retention Policy

The following examples show using the `MANAGE` and `DELETE` subcommands to evaluate, mark, and delete incremental backups when a 1-day recovery window retention policy is in effect. This is shown by the following server configuration:

    [ACCTG]

    host = 192.168.2.24
    port = 5445
    user = enterprisedb
    cluster_owner = enterprisedb
    remote_host = enterprisedb@192.168.2.24
    allow_incremental_backups = enabled
    retention_policy = 1 DAYS
    description = "Accounting"

The following is the current set of backups. In these examples, some columns have been omitted from the `SHOW-BACKUPS` output in order to display the relevant information in a more observable manner.

    -bash-4.2$ bart SHOW-BACKUPS -s acctg
    SERVER NAME BACKUP ID ... BACKUP PARENT BACKUP TIME ... STATUS

    acctg 1481552078404 ... none 2016-12-12 09:14:39 EST ... active

There are two backup chains. In each of the following chains, the first backup is the initial full backup.

First backup chain: `1481552078404 => 1481553088053 => 1481553914533 => 1481554802918 => 1481559014359`

Second backup chain: `1481553651165 => 1481554203288 => 1481559303348`

The `MANAGE` subcommand is invoked when the first full backup `1481552078404` falls out of the recovery window. When the `MANAGE` subcommand is invoked, it is `2016-12-13 09:20:03 EST`, thus making the start of the 1-day recovery window at `2016-12-12 09:20:03 EST` exactly one day earlier. This backup was taken at `2016-12-12 09:14:39 EST`, which is about 5 Â½ minutes before the start of the recovery window, thus making the backup obsolete.

The entire first backup chain is now marked `obsolete`.

The incremental backup date and time are within the recovery window since they were taken after the start of the recovery window of `2016-12-12 09:20:03 EST`, but all backups in the chain are marked as `obsolete`.

    ... obsolete

The following example shows how the entire backup chain is changed back to active status by invoking the `MANAGE` subcommand with the `-c nokeep` option on the full backup of the chain.

    -bash-4.2$ bart MANAGE -s acctg -c nokeep -i 1481552078404
    INFO: changing status of backup '1481552078404' of server 'acctg' from

The following example shows usage of the `MANAGE` subcommand with the `-c keep` option to keep a backup chain indefinitely. The `MANAGE` subcommand with the `-c keep` option must specify the backup identifier or backup name of the full backup of the chain, and not any incremental backup.
