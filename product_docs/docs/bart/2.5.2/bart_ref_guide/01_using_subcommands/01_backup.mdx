title: "BACKUP"
---



Use the `BACKUP` subcommand to create a full or incremental backup.

**Syntax for a Full Backup:**

    bart BACKUP –s { <server_name> | all } [ -F { p | t } ]

    [ -z ] [ –c <compression_level> ]

    [ --backup-name <backup_name> ]

    [ --thread-count <number_of_threads> ]

    [ { --with-pg_basebackup | --no-pg_basebackup } ]

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

While a `BACKUP` is in progress, no other subcommands (`INIT, DELETE, MANAGE, SHOW BACKUPS, VERIFY-CHKSUM`) should be issued. Any subcommands issued while a backup is in progress will skip and ignore the backups.

</div>

**Syntax for an Incremental Backup:**

    bart BACKUP –s <server_name> [ -F p]

    [ --parent { <backup_id> | <backup_name> } ]

    [ --backup-name <backup_name> ]

    [ --thread-count <number_of_threads> ]

    [ --check ]

Before performing an incremental backup, you must take a full backup.

For more details about incremental backup, refer to the *Block-Level Incremental Backup* section of the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery User Guide* available at:

> <https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/>

**Options**

-   `-s { <server_name> | all }` or `--server {<server_name> | all`}
    -   Use this option to specify the database server to be backed up.
    -   Specify `<server_name>` to take a backup of the database server (as specified in the BART configuration file).
    -   Specify `all` to take a backup of all servers.
-   `-F { p | t }` or `--format { p | t }`
    -   Use this option to specify the backup file format.
    -   Specify `p` option to take backup in plain text format and specify `t` to take backup in tar format. If the `p` or `t` option is omitted, the default is tar format.
    -   Use `p` option with the `BACKUP` subcommand when streaming is used as a backup method.

Note

</div>

An incremental backup can only be taken in plain text format (`p`).

</div>

-   `-z` or `--gzip` (applicable only for full backup and `tar` format)

> Use this option to enable gzip compression of tar files using the default compression level (typically 6).

-   `-c <compression_level>` or `--compress-level <compression_level>` (applicable only for full backup and `tar` format)

> Use this option to specify the gzip compression level on the tar file output. `<compression_level>` is a digit from 1 through 9, with 9 being the best compression.

-   `--parent { <backup_id> | <backup_name> }`

    -   Use this option to take an incremental backup. The parent backup is a backup taken prior to the incremental backup; it can be either a full backup or an incremental backup.

    \-`<backup_id>` is the backup identifier of a parent backup and `<backup_name>` is the user-defined alphanumeric name of a parent backup.

-   `--backup-name <backup_name>`

    -   `<backup_name>` is a user-defined, alphanumeric friendly name to be assigned to the backup. The maximum permitted length of backup name is 49 characters.

    -   The backup name may include the following variables to be substituted by the timestamp values when the backup is taken:

        > -   1.  `%year` – 4-digit year
        >
        > -   1.  `%month` – 2-digit month
        >
        > -   1.  `%day` – 2-digit day
        >
        > -   1.  `%hour` – 2-digit hour
        >
        > -   1.  `%minute`– 2-digit minute
        >
        > -   1.  `%second`– 2-digit second

        The following example demonstrates invoking `BACKUP`:

            ./bart backup -s ppas12 -Ft --backup-name "YEAR = %year MONTH =
            %month DAY = %day"

    -   To include the percent sign (`%`) as a character in the backup name, specify `%%` in the alphanumeric string.

        For example,

            ./bart backup -s ppas12 -Ft --backup-name "YEAR = %year MONTH =
            %month DAY = %day %%"

    -   If the backup name contains space characters or when backup name is referenced with the option `-i` by other subcommands (such as `restore`), enclose the string in single quotes (') or double quotes (").

        For example,

            ./bart show-backups -s ppas12 -i "test backup"

    -   If the option `--backup-name` is not specified and the `backup_name` parameter is not set for this database server in the BART configuration file, then the backup can only be referenced in other BART subcommands by the BART assigned backup identifier.

-   `--thread-count <number_of_threads>`

    -   `<number_of_threads>` is the number of worker threads to run in parallel to copy blocks for a backup.
    -   For detailed information about the `--thread-count` parameter, see the configuration section of the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Installation and Upgrade Guide* available at:

    > <https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/>

-   `--with-pg_basebackup` (applicable only for full backup)

    -   Specifies that `pg_basebackup` is to be used to take a full backup. The number of thread counts in effect is ignored as given by the `thread_count` parameter in the BART configuration file.
    -   When taking a full backup, if the thread count in effect is greater than `1`, then the `pg_basebackup` utility is not used to take the full backup (parallel worker threads are used) unless the `--with-pg_basebackup` option is specified with the `BACKUP` subcommand.

-   `--no-pg_basebackup` (applicable only for full backup)

    -   Specifies that `pg_basebackup` is not to be used to take a full backup.
    -   When taking a full backup, if the thread count in effect is only `1`, then the `pg_basebackup` utility is used to take the full backup unless the `--no-pg_basebackup` option is specified with the `BACKUP` subcommand.

-   `--check` (applicable only for incremental backup)

    -   Use this option to verify if the required MBM files are present in the BART backup catalog before taking an incremental backup. However, an actual incremental backup is not taken when the `--check` option is specified.
    -   The `--parent` option must be used along with the `--check` option.

**Examples**

The following example creates a full backup in the default tar format with gzip compression. Note that checksums are generated for the full backup and user-defined tablespaces for the tar format backup.
