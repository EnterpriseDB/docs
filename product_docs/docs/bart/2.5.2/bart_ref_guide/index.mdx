This guide acts as a quick reference for BART subcommands and provides comprehensive examples of the following BART operations:

-   Performing a full backup of database servers
-   Performing point-in-time recovery (PITR) on a remote PostgreSQL database server
-   Restoring an incremental backup
-   Restoring a database cluster with tablespaces
-   Evaluating, marking, and deleting backups and incremental backups
-   Local and remote database server configuration and operation

For detailed information about BART subcommands and operations, see *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery User Guide* available at:

The current document is organized as follows:

-   The [Subcommands](01_using_subcommands/#using_bart_subcommands) section provides information about BART subcommands with options and examples.
-   The [Examples](#examples) section provides examples of BART operations.
-   The [Sample BART System](#a_sample_bart_system_with_local_and_remote_database_servers) section provides a comprehensive example of both local and remote database server configuration and operation.
