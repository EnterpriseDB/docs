title: "Taking a Backup"
---

> This section provides information about creating a full or incremental backup of a database server. For detailed information about taking a full backup, incremental backup, point-in-time recovery and restore process, see the *BART User Guide* available at:
>
> <https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs>
>
> The syntax of the `BACKUP` subcommand is:

```
bart BACKUP –s { server_name | all }
[ -F { p | t } ]
[ -z ] [ –c compression_level ]
[ --parent { backup_id | backup_name } ]
[ --backup-name backup_name ]
[ --thread-count number_of_threads ]
[ { --with-pg_basebackup | --no-pg_basebackup } ]
[ --check ]
```

While a `BACKUP` subcommand is in progress, no other processes may run in parallel.

</div>

Along with the `BACKUP` subcommand, you can:

-   Specify the `–s` option and replace the *server_name* with the server name to be backed up (it must be configured in the BART configuration file). Specify `all` to take a backup of all servers. This argument is mandatory.

    > The backup is saved in the `backup_path/server_name/backup_id` directory.

Specify the following options only if required. If you do not specify any of the following options, the backup is created using the default settings.

-   Specify the `–F p` option to create a backup in the plain text format and `–F t` to create a backup in tar format (default). If the transaction log streaming method is used, then the `-F p` option must be specified.
-   Specify the `–z` option to use gzip compression on the tar file output using the default compression level. This option is applicable only for the tar format.
-   Specify the `–c` option to apply the gzip compression level on the tar file output, and replace `compression_level` with the digit 1 through 9, with 9 being the best compression (applicable only for the tar format).
-   If you want to take an incremental backup, specify the option `--parent` and replace `backup_id` with the backup identifier of a parent backup or replace `backup_name` with the parent backup name. Incremental backup can only be taken in the plain text format (`–F p`). Specify the option `--check` before taking an incremental backup to verify if the required MBM files are present in the BART backup catalog. The `--parent` option must be specified when the `--check` option is used.
-   Specify the option `--backup-name` and replace *backup_name* with the user-friendly name assigned to the backup.
-   Specify the option `–thread count` and replace *number_of_threads* with the number of worker threads to run in parallel to copy blocks for incremental backups
-   Specify the option `--with-pg_basebackup` to use `pg_basebackup` to take a full backup. The number of thread counts in effect is ignored as given by the `thread_count` parameter in the BART configuration file.

Note

</div>

If the thread count in effect is greater than `1`, then the `pg_basebackup` utility is not used to take the full backup unless the `--with-pg_basebackup` option is specified with the `BACKUP` subcommand.

</div>

-   Specify the option `--no pg_basebackup` to not use `pg_basebackup` to take a full backup.

The following example creates a full backup in the default tar format with gzip compression. Note that checksums are generated for the full backup and user-defined tablespaces for the tar format backup.

The following example shows an incremental backup taken by specifying the `--parent` option. The option `-F p` must be specified as well for plain text format.
