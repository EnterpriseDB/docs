Before installing BART, ensure that your repository configuration allows access to the EDB repository. To request credentials to the EDB repository, visit:

> <https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request>

1.  Then, use `yum` to create the repository configuration file:

    `yum install -y https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm`

2.  Modify the repository configuration file (named `edb.repo`, located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`). Ensure that the value of the enabled parameter is `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

3.  Before installing other software, use `yum` to install the EPEL package:

    `yum install epel-release`

4.  Then, use `yum` to install an Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database on any server on which an incremental backup will be restored. The host of the BART server is not required to have an installation of Postgres, but must include a copy of the following:

    -   Postgres `libpq` library
    -   Postgres `pg_basebackup` utility program
    -   Boost Libraries version 1.48 and 1.53 (for RHEL/CentOS 6 and RHEL/CentOS 7 only).

5.  Enable and activate Secure Shell (SSH) and Secure Copy (SCP) client programs on the BART host as well as on the remote database server hosts. The BART host and target database server host must accept a passwordless SSH/SCP login connection.

After meeting the prerequisites, you can install the BART RPM package directly from the EnterpriseDB yum repository with the following command:

> `yum install edb-bart`

Repeat the installation process described in this section to install BART 2.4 on all remote hosts where incremental backups are to be restored.

BART is installed in the `/usr/edb/bart` directory location referred to as `<BART_HOME>`.
