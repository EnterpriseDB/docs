title: "DELETE"
---

The `DELETE` subcommand removes the subdirectory and data files from the BART backup catalog for the specified backups along with archived WAL files.

**Syntax:**

```
bart DELETE –s <server_name>
-i { all | [']{ <backup_id> | <backup_name> },... }['] }
[ -n ]
```

Note that when invoking the `DELETE` subcommand, you must specify a database server.

For database servers under a retention policy, there are conditions where certain backups may not be deleted. For more information, see the EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery User Guide available at the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/).

The following table describes the `DELETE` options:

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Options</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><code>-s</code> (or <code>--server) &lt;server_name&gt;</code></td><td><code>&lt;server_name&gt;</code> is the name of the database server whose backups are to be deleted.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>-i</code> (or <code>--backupid) &#123; all | [']&#123; &lt;backup_id&gt; | &lt;backup_name&gt; &#125;',... &#125;[`] &#125;</code></td><td><p><code>&lt;backup_id&gt;</code> is the backup identifier of the backup to be deleted. <code>&lt;backup_name&gt;</code> is the user-defined alphanumeric name for the backup.<br />
Multiple backup identifiers and backup names may be specified in a comma-separated list. The list must be enclosed within single quotes if there is any white space appearing before or after each comma (see <a href="#deleting_multiple_backups_with_space_characters">Example</a>).<br />
If <code>all</code> is specified, all backups and their archived WAL files for the specified database server are deleted.</p></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>-n</code> or <code>--dry-run</code></td><td>Performs the test run and displays the results prior to physically removing files; no files are actually deleted.</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Example**

The following code sample demonstrates deleting a backup from the specified database server:

```
[edb@localhost bin]$ ./bart DELETE -s acctg -i acctg_2019-08-27
INFO: deleting backup 'acctg_2019-08-27' of server 'acctg'
INFO: deleting backup '1566900093665'
INFO: WALs of deleted backup(s) will belong to prior backup(if any), or will
be marked unused
WARNING: not marking any WALs as unused WALs, the WAL file
'/home/edb/bkup_new/acctg/archived_wals/000000010000000000000025'
is required, yet not available in archived_wals directory
INFO: backup(s) deleted
[edb@localhost bin]$
```

After the deletion, the BART backup catalog for the database server no longer contains the corresponding directory for the deleted `backup ID`. The following code sample displays information about `archived_wals` subdirectory that no longer contains the backup WAL files:

```
[edb@localhost acctg]$ ls -l
total 16
drwxrwxr-x. 3 edb edb 4096 Aug 27 06:03 1566900199604
drwxrwxr-x. 3 edb edb 4096 Aug 27 06:03 1566900204377
drwxrwxr-x. 3 edb edb 4096 Aug 27 06:03 1566900209087
drwxrwxr-x. 3 edb edb 4096 Aug 27 06:05 1566900321228
drwxrwxr-x. 2 edb edb 6 Aug 27 06:01 archived_wals
```

The following code sample demonstrates deleting multiple backups from the database server.
