This section provides a workaround for the following installation issues:

**Installing EPEL**

`Error: Cannot retrieve metalink for repository: epel. Please verify its path and try again`

To fix this issue:

1.  In the `/etc/yum.repos.d/epel.repo` file, comment out all entries starting with `mirrorlist=...` and un-comment all entries starting with `baseurl=....`.
2.  In the `/etc/yum.repos.d/epel-testing.repo` file, comment out all entries starting with `mirrorlist=...` and un-comment all entries starting with `baseurl=....`.

After editing these files, install epel-release again.

**Error: yum.pid**

`existing lock /var/run/yum.pid: another copy is running as pid 3104.` `Another app is currently holding the yum lock; waiting for it to exit`

To fix this issue, execute the following command:

    rm -f /var/run/yum.pid
