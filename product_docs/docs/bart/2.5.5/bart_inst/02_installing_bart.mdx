This section will walk you through performing a fresh installation of BART on a host. Installation instructions are organized into the following platform/installer specific sections:

-   [Installing BART on a CentOS or RHEL Host](#installing_bart_using_an_rpm_package)
-   [Installing BART on a Debian or Ubuntu Host](#installing-bart-on-a-debian-or-ubuntu-host)
-   [Installing BART on an SLES 12 Host](#installing-bart-on-an-sles-12-host)

## Using an RPM Package to Install BART on a CentOS or RHEL Host

The following section demonstrates installing BART 2.5.5 on a RHEL/CentOS host using an RPM package.  This section assumes that the user has some knowledge of installation and system administration procedures, and has administrative privileges on the host.

1.  On a CentOS/RHEL 6 OS host, you need to install the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) package by assuming the superuser privileges and invoking the following command:

<!-- -->

```
yum install epel-release
```

If you encounter any error while installing epel, see [Troubleshooting](04_installation_troubleshooting/#troubleshooting) for a workaround.

On a RHEL/CentOS 7 and 8 host, the EPEL package, which contains supporting boost libraries required by BART is installed by default.

1.  Use either rpm, yum, or dnf to create the repository configuration file:

    rpm -Uvh <https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm>

On RHEL/CentOS 6 and 7:

```
yum install -y https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
```

On RHEL/CentOs 8:

```
dnf install -y https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
```

1.  Visit the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request/) to request credentials to the EDB Yum Repository.

2.  Use your choice of editor to open and modify the repository configuration file. The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo` and is located in the `/etc/yum.repos.d` directory.

3.  After creating the `edb.repo` file,

    -   ensure the value of the `enabled` parameter is `1`.
    -   replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.
    -   save the configuration file and exit the editor.

    > ```
    > [edb]
    > name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
    > baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/
    > rhel-$releasever-$basearch
    > enabled=1
    > gpgcheck=1
    > gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
    > ```

4.  Optionally, install the `pg_basebackup` utility program using the server client package. If you do not already have the `pg_basebackup` program installed on the BART host, you can install a limited number of files that include the `pg_basebackup` program by invoking the following command:

On RHEL/CentOS 6 and 7:

> ```
> yum install edb-as<xx>-server-client
> ```

On RHEL/CentOS 8:

> ```
> dnf install edb-as<xx>-server-client
> ```
>
> In the above command, replace `<xx>` with the required Advanced Server version. The `pg_basebackup` version must be the same or more recent than the database server to be backed up. For example, `pg_basebackup` version 10 can be used to back up database server version 10, but cannot be used to back up database server version 11.

1.  Use the following command to install the BART RPM package:

    On RHEL/CentOS 6 and 7:

    > ```
    > yum install edb-bart
    > ```

    On RHEL/CentOS 8:

    > ```
    > dnf install edb-bart
    > ```

    Repeat the installation process described in this section to install BART on each remote host on which an incremental backup is to be restored.

    To verify the BART installation, navigate to the `/usr/edb/bart/bin` directory and execute the following command:

    > ```
    > bart --version
    > ```

    The `bart --version` command should return the current BART version. If the `bart --version` command returns an error stating the PATH is not available after switching from the root user to another BART user account, adjust the setting of the `PATH` environment variable to include the directory location of the BART `bin` subdirectory in the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` files of the following user accounts:

    -   The BART user account on the BART host. See [Configuring BART](03_configuring_bart/#path) for details.
    -   The remote user account on the remote host to which incremental backups are to be restored. For details, see the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery User Guide* available at the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/).

    Upon successful installation, BART is installed in the `BART_HOME` directory:

    > `/usr/edb/bart`

    The installation includes the following files:

<table><colgroup><col style="width: 31%" /><col style="width: 22%" /><col style="width: 45%" /></colgroup><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>File Name</td><td><blockquote><p>Location</p></blockquote></td><td>Description</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>bart</code></td><td><code>&lt;BART_HOME&gt;/bin</code></td><td>BART command line, executable program</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>bart-scanner</code></td><td><code>&lt;BART_HOME&gt;/bin</code></td><td>BART WAL scanner program</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>bart.cfg.sample</code></td><td><code>&lt;BART_HOME&gt;/etc</code></td><td>Sample BART configuration file</td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>xlogreader_ident.so</code></td><td><code>&lt;BART_HOME&gt;/lib</code></td><td>Libraries supporting WAL versions</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>bart_license.txt</code></td><td><code>&lt;BART_HOME&gt;</code></td><td>License agreement</td></tr></tbody></table>

After BART is installed successfully, you need to [configure the installation](03_configuring_bart/#configuration).

## Installing BART on a Debian or Ubuntu Host

To install BART on a Debian or Ubuntu host, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, visit the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

Perform the following steps to install a Debian package using the EnterpriseDB apt repository.

1.  Assume the superuser privileges.

    > ```
    > sudo su -
    > ```

2.  Configure the EnterpriseDB repository; substitute your EnterpriseDB credentials for the `username` and `password` placeholders in the following command:

    > ```
    > sh -c 'echo "deb https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
    > ```

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories.

    > ```
    > apt-get install apt-transport-https
    > ```

4.  Add the EDB signing key; When invoking the command, replace the `username` and `password` with the credentials provided by EnterpriseDB.

    > ```
    > wget -q -O - https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add –
    > ```

5.  Update the repository metadata.

    > ```
    > apt-get update
    > ```

6.  Install the Debian package.

    > ```
    > apt-get install edb-bart
    > ```

## Installing BART on an SLES 12 Host

This section provides instructions for installing BART on an SLES 12 SP4 host using the zypper package manager.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

BART is supported on SLES SP4 and SP5 versions.

</div>

1.  Assume superuser privileges and use the following command to add the EnterpriseDB repository configuration file to your SLES host:

    ```
    zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo
    ```

    This command creates a repository configuration file named `edb.repo` in the `/etc/zypp/repos.d` directory.

2.  Use the zypper utility to install BART.

    ```
    zypper install edb-bart
    ```
