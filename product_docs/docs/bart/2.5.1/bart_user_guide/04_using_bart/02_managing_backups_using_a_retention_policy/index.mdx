title: "Using a Retention Policy to Manage Backups"

<div id="managing_backups_using_a_retention_policy" class="registered_link"></div>

Over the course of time when using BART, the number of backups can grow significantly. This ultimately leads to a large consumption of disk space unless an administrator periodically performs the process of deleting the oldest backups that are no longer needed. This process of determining when a backup is old enough to be deleted and then actually deleting such backups can be done and automated with the following basic steps:

1.  Determine and set a retention policy in the BART configuration file. A *retention policy* is a rule that determines when a backup is considered obsolete. The retention policy can be applied globally to all servers, but each server can override the global retention policy with its own (see the configuration section of the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Installation and Upgrade Guide* for details).
2.  Use the `MANAGE` subcommand to categorize and manage backups according to the retention policy.
3.  Create a cron job to periodically run the `MANAGE` subcommand to evaluate the backups and then list and/or delete the obsolete backups.

There is a difference on how retention policy management applies to incremental backups as compared to full backups. See [Section - Managing Incremental Backups](../04_using_bart/02_managing_backups_using_a_retention_policy/#managing_incremental_backups) for information about how retention policy management applied to full backups affects incremental backups.

The following sections describe how retention policy management generally applies to backups, and its specific usage and effect on full backups:

-   [Section - Overview - Managing Backups Using a Retention Policy](../04_using_bart/02_managing_backups_using_a_retention_policy/#overview_managing_backups_using_a_retention_policy) provides an overview of the terminology and types of retention policies.
-   [Section - Marking the Backup Status](../04_using_bart/02_managing_backups_using_a_retention_policy/#marking_the_backup_status) describes the concept of marking the status of backups according to the retention policy.
-   [Section - Setting the Retention Policy](../04_using_bart/02_managing_backups_using_a_retention_policy/#setting_the_retention_policy) describes setting the different types of retention policies.
-   [Section - Managing the Backups Based on the Retention Policy](../04_using_bart/02_managing_backups_using_a_retention_policy/#managing_the_backups_based_on_the_retention_policy) describes the process of managing the backups such as marking the backup status, keeping selected backups indefinitely, listing obsolete backups, and deleting obsolete backups.

The examples shown in the previously listed sections were generated with BART version 1.1. The retention policy management process is the same for the current BART version, however the displayed output of the `SHOW-BACKUPS` and `SHOW-SERVERS` subcommands now include a few additional fields that do not influence the retention policy.
