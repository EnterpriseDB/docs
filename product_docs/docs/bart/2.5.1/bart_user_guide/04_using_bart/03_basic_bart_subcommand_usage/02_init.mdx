The `INIT` subcommand is used to perform the following actions:

-   Create the BART backup catalog directory.
-   Rebuild the BART `backupinfo` file.
-   Set the `archive_command` in the PostgreSQL server based on the `archive_command` setting in the `bart.cfg` file.

</div>

If the `archive_mode` configuration parameter is set to `off`, then the `-o` option must be used to set the Postgres `archive_command` using the BART `archive_command` parameter in the BART configuration file even if the `archive_command` is not currently set in `postgresql.conf` nor in `postgresql.auto.conf`.

</div>

To view examples of `INIT` subcommand, see the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Reference Guide.*

**Syntax:**

    bart INIT [ –s { <server_name> | all } ] [ -o ]
      [ -r [ -i { <backup_id> | <backup_name> | all } ] ]
      [--no-configure]

In the above syntax diagram, `INIT` is the BART subcommand and `–s server_name`, `all`, `-o`, `-r`, `-i`, `no-configure` are the subcommand options.

The subcommand option keywords must generally be in lowercase, except when specified differently in this section.

**Options**

-   `-s or --server {<server_name> | all }`

> `server_name` is the name of the database server to which the `INIT` actions are to be applied. If `all` is specified or if the option is omitted, the actions are applied to all servers.

-   `-o` or `–override`

> Overrides the existing, active Postgres `archive_command` configuration parameter setting in the `postgresql.conf` file or the `postgresql.auto.conf` file using the BART `archive_command` parameter in the BART configuration file. The `INIT` generated archive command string is written to the `postgresql.auto.conf` file.

-   `-r` or `–rebuild`

> Rebuilds the backupinfo file (a text file named `backupinfo`) located in each backup subdirectory.

-   `-i` or `--backupid { <backup_id> | <backup_name> | all }`

> `<backup_id>` is an integer, backup identifier and `<backup_name>` is the user-defined alphanumeric name for the backup. If `all` is specified or if the option is omitted, the backupinfo files of all backups for the database servers specified by the `-s` option are recreated. The `-i` option can only be used with the `-r` option.

**Archive Command Setting**

After the `archive_command` is set, you need to either restart the PostgreSQL server or reload the configuration file in the PostgreSQL server based on the following conditions. See the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Reference Guide* for examples of each of this condition.

-   If the `archive_mode` is set to `off` and `archive_command` is not set in the PostgreSQL server, the `archive_command` is set based on the `archive_command` setting in the `bart.cfg` and also sets the `archive_mode` to on. In this case, you need to restart the PostgreSQL server using `pg_ctl restart`
-   If the `archive_mode` is set to `on` and `archive_command` is not set in the PostgreSQL server, the `archive_command` is set based on the `archive_command` setting in the `bart.cfg`. In this case, you need to reload the configuration in the PostgreSQL server using `pg_reload_conf()` or `pg_ctl reload`.
-   If the `archive_mode` is set to off and `archive_command` is already set in the PostgreSQL server, the `archive_mode` is set to on. In this case, you need to restart the PostgreSQL server using `pg_ctl restart`
-   If the `archive_mode` is set to on and `archive_command` is already set in the PostgreSQL server, then the `archive_command` is not set unless `-o` option is specified.
