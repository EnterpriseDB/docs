The `CHECK-CONFIG` subcommand checks the parameter settings in the BART configuration file as well as the database server configuration for which the `-s` option is specified. To view examples of `CHECK-CONFIG` subcommand, refer to the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Reference Guide*.

**Syntax:**

`bart CHECK-CONFIG [ –s server_name ]`

**Options**

`-s` or `--server <server_name>`

`server_name` is the name of the database server to be checked for proper configuration. If the option is omitted, the settings of the global section of the BART configuration file are checked.

Please note:

-   When the `-s` option is omitted, the global section \[BART], which contains parameters including `bart_host`, `backup_path`, and `pg_basebackup_path` is checked.
-   When the `-s` option is specified, the parameters in the specified server section are checked. In addition, certain `postgresql.conf` parameters for the database server must be properly set and the database server must be activated for certain processes. These requirements include the following:
    -   The `cluster_owner` parameter must be set to the user account owning the database cluster directory.
    -   A password-less SSH/SCP connection must be set between the BART user and the user account specified by the `cluster_owner` parameter.
    -   A database superuser must be specified by the BART `user` parameter.
    -   The `pg_hba.conf` file must contain a replication entry for the database superuser specified by the BART `user` parameter.
    -   The `archive_mode` parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file must be enabled.
    -   The `archive_command` parameter in the `postgresql.auto.conf` or the `postgresql.conf` file must be set.
    -   The `allow_incremental_backups` parameter in the BART configuration file must be enabled for database servers for which incremental backups are to be taken.
    -   Archiving of WAL files to the BART backup catalog must be in process.
    -   The WAL scanner program must be running.

The `CHECK-CONFIG` subcommand displays an error message if the required configuration is not properly set.
