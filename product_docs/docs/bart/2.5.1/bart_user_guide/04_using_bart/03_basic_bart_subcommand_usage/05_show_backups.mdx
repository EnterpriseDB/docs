title: "SHOW-BACKUPS"
---



The `SHOW-BACKUPS` subcommand displays the backup information for the managed database servers. To view examples of `SHOW-BACKUPS` subcommand, see the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Reference Guide*.

**Syntax:**

    bart SHOW-BACKUPS [ –s { <server_name> | all } ]
      [ -i { <backup_id> | <backup_name> | all } ]
      [ -t ]

In the above syntax diagram, `SHOW-BACKUPS` is the BART subcommand and `–s <server_name>`, `all`, `<backup_id>`, `<backup_name>`, `-i`, `-t` are the subcommand options.

**Options**

-   `-s { <server_name> | all }` or `--server { <server_name> | all }`

    -   `<server_name>` is the name of the database server whose backup information is to be displayed.
    -   If `all` is specified or if the option is omitted, the backup information for all database servers is displayed with the exception as described by the following note:

    > <div class="note">
    >
    > <div class="title">
    >
    > Note
    >
    > </div>
    >
    > If `SHOW-BACKUPS` is invoked while the BART `BACKUP` subcommand is in progress, backups affected by the backup process are shown in progress status in the displayed backup information.
    >
    > </div>

-   `-i { <backup_id> | <backup_name> | all }` or `--backupid { <backup_id> | <backup_name> | all }`

> `<backup_id>` is a backup identifier. `<backup_name>` is the user-defined alphanumeric name for the backup. If `all` is specified or if the option is omitted, all backup information for the relevant database server is displayed.

-   `-t` or `–toggle`

> Displays more backup information in list format. If the option is omitted, the default is a tabular format.
