<div id="verify_chksum" class="registered_link"></div>


The `VERIFY-CHKSUM` subcommand verifies the MD5 checksums of the full backups and any user-defined tablespaces for the specified database server or for all database servers. The checksum is verified by comparing the current checksum of the backup against the checksum when the backup was taken.

</div>

The `VERIFY-CHKSUM` subcommand is only used for tar format backups. It is not applicable to plain format backups.

</div>

**Syntax:**

    bart VERIFY-CHKSUM
      [ â€“s { <server_name> | all } ]
      [ -i { <backup_id> | <backup_name> | all } ]

**Options**

-   `-s { <server_name> | all }` or `--server { <server_name> | all }`

> `<server_name>` is the name of the database server whose tar backup checksums are to be verified. If `all` is specified or if the `-s` option is omitted, the checksums are verified for all database servers.

-   `-i { <backup_id> | <backup_name> | all }` or `--backupid { <backup_id> | <backup_name> | all }`

> `<backup_id>` is the backup identifier of a tar format full backup whose checksum is to be verified along with any user-defined tablespaces. `<backup_name>` is the user-defined alphanumeric name for the full backup. If `all` is specified or if the `-i` option is omitted, the checksums of all tar backups for the relevant database server are verified.

**Example**

The following example verifies the checksum of all tar format backups of the specified database server.

    -bash-4.1$ bart VERIFY-CHKSUM -s acctg -i all
     SERVER NAME   BACKUP ID       VERIFY

     acctg         1430239348243   OK
     acctg         1430232284202   OK
     acctg         1430232016284   OK
     acctg         1430231949065   OK
     acctg         1429821844271   OK
