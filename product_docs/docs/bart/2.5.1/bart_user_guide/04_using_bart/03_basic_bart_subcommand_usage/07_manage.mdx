<div id="manage" class="registered_link"></div>


The `MANAGE` subcommand can be invoked to:

-   Evaluate backups, mark their status, and delete obsolete backups based on the `retention_policy` parameter in the BART configuration file (See [Section - Managing Backups Using a Retention Policy](../../04_using_bart/02_managing_backups_using_a_retention_policy/#managing_backups_using_a_retention_policy) for information about retention policy management).

-   Compress the archived WAL files based on the `wal_compression` parameter in the BART configuration file (See the configuration section of the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Installation and Upgrade Guide* for information about setting this parameter).

    > **Syntax:**
    >
    >     bart MANAGE [ –s { <server_name> | all} ]
    >       [ -l ] [ -d ]
    >       [ -c { keep | nokeep }
    >         -i { <backup_id> | <backup_name> | all } ]
    >       [ -n ]

The following summarizes the actions performed under certain conditions and options when the `MANAGE` subcommand is invoked.

-   When the `MANAGE` subcommand is invoked with no options or with only the `-s <server_name>` or `-s all` option, the following actions are performed:
    -   For the server specified by the `-s` option, or for all servers (if `-s all` is specified or the `-s` option is omitted), active backups are marked as `obsolete` in accordance with the retention policy.
    -   All backups that were marked `obsolete` or `keep` prior to invoking the `MANAGE` subcommand remain marked with the same prior status.
    -   If WAL compression is enabled for the database server, then any uncompressed, archived WAL files in the BART backup catalog of the database server are compressed with gzip.
-   When the `MANAGE` subcommand is invoked with any other option besides the `-s` option, the following actions are performed:
    -   For the server specified by the `-s` option, or for all servers, the action performed is determined by the other specified options (that is, `-l` to list obsolete backups, `-d` to delete obsolete backups, `-c` to keep or to return backups to `active` status, or `-n` to perform a dry run of any action).
    -   No marking of `active` backups to `obsolete` status is performed regardless of the retention policy.
    -   All backups that were marked `obsolete` or `keep` prior to invoking the `MANAGE` subcommand remain marked with the same prior status unless the `-c` option (without the `-n` option) is specified to change the backup status of the particular backup or all backups referenced with the `-i` option.
    -   No compression is applied to any uncompressed, archived WAL file in the BART backup catalog regardless of whether or not WAL compression is enabled.

The following are additional considerations when using WAL compression:

-   Compression of archived WAL files is not permitted for database servers on which incremental backups are to be taken.
-   The gzip compression program must be installed on the BART host and be accessible in the `PATH` of the BART user account.
-   When the `RESTORE` subcommand is invoked, if the `-c` option is specified or if the `copy_wals_during_restore` BART configuration parameter is enabled for the database server, then the following actions occur:
    -   If compressed, archived WAL files are stored in the BART backup catalog and the location to which the WAL files are to be restored is on a remote host relative to the BART host:

        > -   the archived WAL files are transmitted across the network to the remote host in compressed format only if the gzip compression program is accessible in the `PATH` of the remote user account that is used to log into the remote host when performing the `RESTORE` operation.
        > -   This remote user is specified with either the `remote_host` parameter in the BART configuration file or the `RESTORE -r` option (see the [Section - RESTORE](../../04_using_bart/03_basic_bart_subcommand_usage/#restore)).
        > -   Transmission of compressed WAL files results in less network traffic. After the compressed WAL files are transmitted across the network, the `RESTORE` subcommand uncompresses the files for the point-in-time recovery operation.
        > -   If the gzip program is not accessible on the remote host in the manner described in the previous bullet point, then the compressed, archived WAL files are first uncompressed while on the BART host, then transmitted across the network to the remote host in uncompressed format.
-   When the `RESTORE` subcommand is invoked without the `-c` option and the `copy_wals_during_restore` BART configuration parameter is disabled for the database server, then any compressed, archived WAL files needed for the `RESTORE` operation are uncompressed in the BART backup catalog. The uncompressed WAL files can then be saved to the remote host by the `restore_command` in the `postgresql.auto.conf` file when the database server archive recovery begins.

**Options**

-   \-`s { <server_name> | all }` or `--server { <server_name> | all }`

> `<server_name>` is the name of the database server to which the actions are to be applied. If `all` is specified or if the `-s` option is omitted, the actions are applied to all database servers.

-   `-l` or `--list-obsolete`

> List the backups marked as obsolete.

-   `-d` or `--delete-obsolete`

> Delete the backups marked as `obsolete`. This action physically deletes the backup along with its archived WAL files and any MBM files for incremental backups.

-   `-c { keep | nokeep }` or `--change-status { keep | nokeep }`
    -   Change the status of a backup to `keep` to retain it indefinitely.
    -   Specify `nokeep` to change the status of any backup back to active status. The backup can then be re-evaluated and possibly be marked to `obsolete` according to the retention policy by subsequent usage of the `MANAGE` subcommand.

The `–i` option must be included when using the `-c` option.

</div>

-   `-i { <backup_id> | <backup_name> | all }` or `--backupid { <backup_id> | <backup_name> | all }`

> `<backup_id>` is a backup identifier. `<backup_name>` is the user-defined alphanumeric name for the backup. If `all` is specified, the actions are applied to all backups.

The `-i` option must only be used with the `-c` option.

-   `-n`, `--dry-run`

> Performs the test run and displays the results prior to actually implementing the actions as if the operation was performed, however, no changes are actually made.
>
> If `-n` is specified:
>
> > -   with the `-d` option, it displays which backups would be deleted, but does not actually delete the backups.
> > -   with the `-c` option, it displays the keep or nokeep action, but does not actually change the backup from its current status.
> > -   alone with no other options, or with only the `-s` option, it displays which active backups would be marked as obsolete, but does not actually change the backup status. In addition, no compression is performed on uncompressed, archived WAL files even if WAL compression is enabled for the database server.
