The `BACKUP` subcommand is used to create a full backup or an incremental backup. To view examples of a full backup and an incremental backup, see the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Reference Guide*.

**Syntax for full backup:**

```
bart BACKUP –s { server_name | all } [ -F { p | t } ]
  [ -z ] [ –c compression_level ]
  [ --backup-name backup_name ]
  [ --thread-count number_of_threads ]
  [ { --with-pg_basebackup | --no-pg_basebackup } ]
```

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

While taking a backup, if there is a file exceeding 1GB size in the $PGDATA directory, the backup will fail. To avoid such backup failure, you need to store large files outside the $PGDATA directory.

For example, if the database server log file exceeds 1 GB size in the `$PGDATA` directory, you need to store them outside the `$PGDATA` directory to avoid backup failure.

</div>

**Syntax for incremental Backup:**

```
bart BACKUP –s { server_name | all } [ -F p]
 [ --parent { backup_id | backup_name } ]
  [ --backup-name backup_name ]
  [ --thread-count number_of_threads ]
  [ --check ]
```

To take an incremental backup, you must take a full backup first followed by incremental backup.

For more details about incremental backup, see <span class="title-ref">Block-Level Incremental Backup &lt;block-level_incremental_backup></span>.

**Please Note:**

-   While a `BACKUP` subcommand is in progress, no other subcommands (`INIT, DELETE, MANAGE, SHOW BACKUPS, VERIFY-CHKSUM`) must be issued. Any subcommands issued while a backup is in progress will skip and ignore the backups.

    For full backup, the target default format is a tar file. For incremental backup, only plain format must be specified.

-   The backup is saved in the following `backup_path/server_name/backup_id directory`.

    > where

    -   `backup_path` is the value assigned to the `backup_path` parameter in the BART configuration file.
    -   `server_name` is the lowercase name of the database server as listed in the configuration file.
    -   `<backup_id>` is a backup identifier assigned by BART to the particular backup.

-   MD5 checksums of the full backup and any user-defined tablespaces are saved as well for tar backups.

-   When you use BART to take a backup of PostgreSQL server versions:

    -   9.5 or prior, only one backup per server may be in progress at any given time and if a backup is interrupted, you must manually run the `pg_stop_backup()` command to terminate the backup mode.
    -   9.6 or higher, multiple backups can be taken simultaneously and if a backup is interrupted, the backup mode is terminated automatically without the need to run `pg_stop_backup()` command manually to terminate the backup.

-   Before performing the backup, BART checks to ensure if there is enough disk space to completely store the backup in the BART backup catalog.

> See the error message table in the `BACKUP` section of the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Reference Guide* for the error message that will be displayed if BART detects insufficient disk space.

-   In the `postgresql.conf` file, ensure the `wal_keep_segments` configuration parameter is set to a sufficiently large value. See the error message table in the `BACKUP` section of the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Reference Guide* for the error message that will be displayed if `wal_keep_segments` configuration parameter is not set to a sufficiently large value.

> A low setting of the `wal_keep_segments` configuration parameter may result in the deletion of some WAL files before the BART `BACKUP` subcommand saves them to the BART backup catalog. For information about the `wal_keep_segments` parameter, see the [PostgreSQL Core Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-replication.html).

-   If in the BART configuration file, parameter setting `xlog_method=stream` applies to a given database server, streaming of the transaction log in parallel with creation of the backup is performed for that database server, otherwise the transaction log files are collected upon completion of the backup. See the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Installation and Upgrade Guide* for details about database server setting.

> If the transaction log streaming method is used, the `-F p` option for a plain text backup format must be specified with the `BACKUP` subcommand.

**Options**

Along with the `BACKUP` subcommand, you can specify the following options:

-   `-s { server_name | all }` or `--server { server_name | all } server_name` is the database server name to be backed up as specified in the BART configuration file. If `all` is specified, all servers are backed up. This option is mandatory.

> <div class="note">
>
> <div class="title">
>
> Note
>
> </div>
>
> If `all` is specified, and a connection to a database server listed in the BART configuration file cannot be opened, the backup for that database server is skipped, but the backup operation continues for the other database servers. See the error message table in the `BACKUP` section of the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Reference Guide* for the error message that will be displayed when a database server connection fails.\`

> </div>

Specify the following options only if required. If you do not specify any of the following options, backup is created with the default setting.

-   `-F { p | t }` or `--format { p | t }`

    Specifies the backup file format. Use `p` for plain text or `t` for tar. If the option is omitted, the default is tar format.

-   `-z` or `--gzip` ( applicable only for full backup)

> Specifies usage of gzip compression on the tar file output using the default compression level. This option is applicable only for the tar format.

-   `-c compression_level` or `--compress-level compression_level` (applicable only for full backup)

> Specifies the gzip compression level on the tar file output. `compression_level` is a digit from 1 through 9, with 9 being the best compression. This option is applicable only for the tar format.

-   `--parent { backup_id | backup_name }`

    > -   Specify this option if you want to take an incremental backup. `<backup_id>` is the backup identifier of a parent backup. `<backup_name>` is the user-defined alphanumeric name of a parent backup.
    > -   The parent is a backup taken prior to the incremental backup. The parent backup can be either a full backup or an incremental backup.
    > -   The option `–F p` must be specified since an incremental backup can only be taken in plain text format.

-   `--backup-name <backup_name>`

    > User-defined, alphanumeric friendly name to be assigned to the backup. The maximum permitted length of backup name is 49 characters.
    >
    > -   The backup name may include the following variables to be substituted by the timestamp values when the backup is taken: 1) `%year` – 4-digit year, 2) `%month` – 2-digit month, 3) `%day` – 2-digit day, 4) `%hour` – 2-digit hour, 5) `%minute` – 2-digit minute, and 6) `%second` – 2-digit second.

    >     ```
    >
    > -   To include the percent sign (`%`) as a character in the backup name, specify `%%` in the alphanumeric string.

    >     ./bart backup -s ppas12 -Ft --backup-name "YEAR = %year
    >     MONTH = %month DAY = %day %%"
    >     ```
    >
    > -   If the backup name contains space characters (i.e. more than one word) or when referenced with the option `-i`by other subcommands (such as `restore`), enclose the string in single quotes (') or double quotes (").

    >     ```
    >     ./bart show-backups -s ppas12 -i "test backup"
    >     ```
    >
    > -   If the option `--backup-name` is not specified, and the `backup_name` parameter is not set for this database server in the BART configuration file, then the backup can only be referenced in other BART subcommands by the BART assigned backup identifier.

-   `--thread-count number_of_threads`

    > If the option `--thread-count` is:
    >
    > -   specified, `number_of_threads` is the number of worker threads to run in parallel to copy blocks for a backup.
    > -   omitted, then the `thread_count` parameter in the BART configuration file applicable to this database server is used.
    > -   not enabled for this database server, then the `thread_count` setting in the global section of the BART configuration file is used.
    > -   not set in the global section as well, the default number of threads is 1.

    >
    > </div>

See the configuration section of the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Installation and Upgrade Guide* for information about the `--thread-count` parameter.

-   `--with-pg_basebackup` (applicable only for full backup)

> Specifies that `pg_basebackup` is to be used to take a full backup. The number of thread counts in effect is ignored as given by the `thread_count` parameter in the BART configuration file.

-   `--check` ( applicable only for incremental backup)

> Verifies that the required MBM files are present in the BART backup catalog before taking an incremental backup,. The option `--parent` must be specified when the option `--check` is used. An actual incremental backup is not taken when the option `--check` is specified.
