The `DELETE` subcommand removes the subdirectory and data files from the BART backup catalog for the specified backups along with its archived WAL files. To view examples of how to use the `DELETE` subcommand, see the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Reference Guide*.

**Syntax:**

```
bart DELETE –s <server_name>
  -i { all |
       [']{ <backup_id> | <backup_name> },... }[']
     }
  [ -n ]
```

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

While invoking the `DELETE` subcommand, you must specify a specific database server.

</div>

For database servers under a retention policy, there are conditions where certain backups may not be deleted. See the [Section Deletions Permitted Under a Retention Policy](../../04_using_bart/02_managing_backups_using_a_retention_policy/#deletions_permitted_under_retention_policy) for information regarding permitted backup deletions.

**Options**

-   `-s` or `--server <server_name>`

> `<server_name>` is the name of the database server whose backups are to be deleted.

-   `-i` (or `–backupid`) `{ all | [']{ <backup_id> | <backup_name> },... }['] }`

    > -   `<backup_id>` is the backup identifier of the backup to be deleted. `<backup_name>` is the user-defined alphanumeric name for the backup.
    > -   Multiple backup identifiers and backup names may be specified in a comma-separated list. The list must be enclosed within single quotes if there is any white space appearing before or after each comma.
    > -   If `all` is specified, all of the backups and their archived WAL files for the specified database server are deleted.

-   `-n` or `--dry-run`

    > Displays the results as if the deletions were done, however, no physical removal of the files are actually performed. In other words, a test run is performed so that you can see the potential results prior to actually initiating the action.
    >
    > After the deletion, the BART backup catalog for the database server no longer contains the corresponding directory for the deleted backup ID. The `archived_wals` subdirectory no longer contains the WAL files of the backup.
