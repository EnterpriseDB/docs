<div id="running_the_bart_wal_scanner" class="registered_link"></div>

Use the BART WAL scanner to invoke the `bart-scanner` program located in the `BART_HOME/bin` directory.

**Syntax:**

```
bart-scanner
  [ -d ]
  [ -c <config_file_path> ]
  { –h |
    -v |
    --daemon |
    -p mbm_file |
    wal_file |
    RELOAD |
    STOP }
```

For clarity, the syntax diagram shows only the single-character form (`-d`) of the option, but the multi-character form (`--debug`) is supported as well.

The WAL scanner processes each WAL file to find and record modified blocks in a corresponding modified block map (MBM) file. The default approach is that the WAL scanner gets notified whenever a new WAL file is added to the `archived_wals` directory of the BART backup catalog. It then scans the WAL file and produces the MBM file.

The default approach does not work in some cases; for example when the WAL files are shipped to the BART backup catalog using the `rsync` utility and also in case of some specific platforms. This results in the WAL files being copied to the `archived_wals` directory, but the WAL scanner does not scan them ((as WAL scanner is not aware of WAL file) and produce the MBM files. This results in the failure of an incremental backup. This can be avoided by using the timer-based WAL scanning approach, which is done by using the `scan_interval` parameter in the BART configuration file. The value for `scan_interval` is the number of seconds after which the WAL scanner will scan the new WAL files.

When the `bart-scanner` program is invoked, it forks a separate process for each database server enabled with the `allow_incremental_backups` parameter.

The WAL scanner processes can run in either the foreground or background depending upon usage of the `--daemon` option:

-   If the `--daemon` option is specified, the WAL scanner process runs in the background. All output messages can be viewed in the BART log file.
-   If the `--daemon` option is omitted, the WAL scanner process runs in the foreground. All output messages can be viewed from the terminal running the program as well as in the BART log file.

See the configuration section of the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Installation and Upgrade Guide* for additional information about WAL scanning, `scan_interval`, `allow_incremental_backups`, and `logfile` parameters.

When invoking the WAL scanner, the current user must be the BART user account.

The BART user account’s `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable may need to be set to include the directory containing the `libpq` library if invocation of the WAL scanner program fails. See the [Section - Basic BART Subcommand Usage](03_basic_bart_subcommand_usage/#basic_bart_subcommand_usage) for information about setting `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

**Options**

-   `-h` or `—help`

> Displays general syntax and information on WAL scanner usage.

-   `-v` or `—version`

> Displays the WAL scanner version information.

-   `-d` or `–debug`

> Displays debugging output while executing the WAL scanner with any of its options.

-   `-c config_file_path` or `--config-path config_file_path`

> Specifies `config_file_path` as the full directory path to a BART configuration file. Use this option if you do not want to use the default BART configuration file `BART_HOME/etc/bart.cfg`.

-   `--daemon`

> Runs the WAL scanner as a background process.

-   \-`p mbm_file` or `--print mbm_file`

> Specifies the full directory path to an MBM file whose content is to be printed. The archive path directory `backup_path/server_name/archived_wals` contains the MBM files.

-   `wal_file`

> Specifies the full directory path to a WAL file to be scanned. The archive path directory `backup_path/server_name/archived_wals` contains the WAL files. Use it if a WAL file in the archive path is missing its MBM file.

-   `RELOAD`

    > -   Reloads the BART configuration file. The keyword `RELOAD` is case-insensitive.
    > -   The `RELOAD` option is useful if you make changes to the configuration file after the WAL scanner has been started. It will reload the configuration file and adjust the WAL scanners accordingly. For example, if a server section allowing incremental backups is removed from the BART configuration file, then the process attached to that server will stop. Similarly, if a server allowing incremental backups is added, a new WAL scanner process will be launched to scan the WAL files of that server.

-   `STOP`

> Stops the WAL scanner. The keyword `STOP` is case-insensitive.

See the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Reference Guide* for examples of usage of BART WAL scanner and its options.
