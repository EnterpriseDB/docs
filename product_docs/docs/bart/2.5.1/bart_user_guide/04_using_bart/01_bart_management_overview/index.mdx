After configuring BART, you can begin the BART backup and recovery management process. The following steps will help you get started:

1.  Run the `CHECK-CONFIG` subcommand without the `-s` option. When the `CHECK-CONFIG` subcommand is used without specifying the `-s` option, it checks the parameters in the global section of the BART configuration file.
2.  Run the `INIT` subcommand (if you have not already done so) to finish creation of the BART backup catalog, which results in the complete directory structure to which backups and WAL files are saved. This step must be done before restarting the database servers with enabled WAL archiving, otherwise the copy operation in the `archive_command` parameter of the `postgresql.conf` file or the `postgresql.auto.conf` file fails due to the absence of the target archive directory. When the directory structure is complete, the lowest level subdirectory named `server_name/archived_wals`, referred to as the *archive path*, should exist for each database server.
3.  Start the Postgres database servers with archiving enabled. Verify that the WAL files are appearing in the `server_name/archived_wals` archive paths for each database server. (The archiving frequency is dependent upon other `postgresql.conf` configuration parameters.) Check the Postgres database server log files to ensure there are no archiving errors. Archiving should be operational before taking a backup in order to ensure that the WAL files that may be created during the backup process are archived.
4.  Start the WAL scanner if you intend to take incremental backups. Since the WAL scanner processes the WAL files copied to the archive paths in the BART backup catalog, it is advantageous to commence the WAL scanning as soon as the WAL files begin to appear in the BART backup catalog in order to keep the scanning in pace with the WAL archiving.
5.  Run the BART `CHECK-CONFIG` subcommand for each database server with the `-s` option specifying the server name. This ensures the database server is properly configured for taking backups.
6.  Create a full backup for each database server. The full backup establishes the starting point of when point-in-time recovery can begin and also establishes the initial parent backup for any incremental backups to be taken.

There are now a number of other BART management processes you may perform:

-   Execute the `BACKUP` subcommand to create additional full backups or incremental backups.
-   Use the `VERIFY-CHKSUM` subcommand to verify the checksum of the full backups .
-   Display database server information with the `SHOW-SERVERS` subcommand.
-   Display backup information with the `SHOW-BACKUPS` subcommand.
-   Compress the archived WAL files in the BART backup catalog by enabling WAL compression in the BART configuration file and then invoking the `MANAGE` subcommand.
-   Determine and set the retention policy for backups in the BART configuration file.
-   Establish the procedure for using the `MANAGE` subcommand to enforce the retention policy for backups. This may include using `cron` jobs to schedule the `MANAGE` subcommand.
