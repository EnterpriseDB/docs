<div id="conventions_used_in_this_guide" class="registered_link"></div>


The following is a list of conventions used throughout this document.

-   Much of the information in this document applies interchangeably to the PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server database systems. The term *Advanced Server* is used to refer to EDB Postgres Advanced Server. The term *Postgres* is used to generically refer to both PostgreSQL and Advanced Server. When a distinction needs to be made between these two database systems, the specific names, PostgreSQL or Advanced Server are used.

-   The installation directory of the PostgreSQL or Advanced Server products is referred to as `POSTGRES_INSTALL_HOME`:

    > -   For PostgreSQL Linux installations, this defaults to `/opt/PostgreSQL/x.x` for version 10 and earlier. For later versions, the installation directory is `/var/lib/pgsql/x`.
    > -   For Advanced Server Linux installations performed using the interactive installer for version 10 and earlier, this defaults to `/opt/PostgresPlus/x.xAS` or `/opt/edb/asx.x`. For Advanced Server Linux installations performed with an RPM package, this defaults to `/usr/ppas-x.x` or `/usr/edb/asx.x`. For Advanced Server Linux installations performed with an RPM package for version 11, this defaults to `/usr/edb/as11`.

## Restrictions on pg\_basebackup



BART takes full backups using the `pg_basebackup` utility program under the following conditions:

-   The backup is taken on a standby server.
-   The `--with-pg_basebackup` option is specified with the `BACKUP` subcommand for forcing the usage of `pg_basebackup` (see [Section - Backup](04_using_bart/03_basic_bart_subcommand_usage/#backup)).
-   The number of thread counts in effect is 1, and the `-pg_basebackup` option is not specified with the `BACKUP` subcommand.
-   Database servers can only be backed up by using `pg_basebackup` of the same or later version than the database server version. For example, `pg_basebackup` version 9.5 can back up database server version 9.5, but it cannot be used to back up database server version 9.6.

In the global section of the BART configuration file, the `pg_basebackup_path` parameter specifies the complete directory path to the `pg_basebackup` program.

For information about this parameter and also for setting the `thread_count`, see the configuration section of the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Installation and Upgrade Guide* available at:

For information about `pg_basebackup`, see the [PostgreSQL Core Documentation](https://postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-pgbasebackup.html).
