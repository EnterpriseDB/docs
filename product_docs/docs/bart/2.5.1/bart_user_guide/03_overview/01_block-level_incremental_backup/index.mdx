This section describes the basic concepts of a block-level incremental backup (referred to as an incremental backup). An incremental backup is functionality unique to BART.

An incremental backup provides a number of advantages when compared to using a full backup:

-   The amount of time required to produce an incremental backup is generally less than a full backup, as modified relation blocks are saved instead of all full relation files of the database cluster.
-   An incremental backup uses less disk space than a full backup taken in plain text format.

Generally, all BART features (such as retention policy management) apply to incremental backups as well as full backups. See [Section Managing Incremental Backups](../../04_using_bart/02_managing_backups_using_a_retention_policy/05_managing_incremental_backups/#managing_incremental_backups) for information about retention policy management as applied to incremental backups.
