Using incremental backups involves the following sequence of steps:

1.  Configure BART (see *the EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Installation and Upgrade Guide* for details about configuring BART).
2.  Enable and initiate archiving of WAL files to the BART backup catalog in the same manner as done for full backups.
3.  Take an initial full backup with the `BACKUP` subcommand. This full backup establishes the parent of the first incremental backup.
4.  Scan all WAL files produced by database servers on which incremental backups are to be taken. These WAL files are scanned once they have been archived to the BART backup catalog. Each scanned WAL file results in a modified block map (MBM) file that records the location of modified blocks obtained from the corresponding WAL file. The BART WAL scanner program `bart-scanner` performs this process.
5.  Take incremental backups using the `BACKUP` subcommand with the `--parent` option to specify the backup identifier or name of a previous, full backup or an incremental backup. Any previous backup may be chosen as the parent as long as all backups belong to the same timeline.
6.  The incremental backup process identifies which WAL files may contain changes from when the parent backup was taken to the starting point of the incremental backup. The corresponding MBM files are used to locate and copy the modified blocks to the incremental backup directory along with other database cluster directories and files. Instead of backing up all, full relation files, only the modified blocks are copied and saved. In addition, the relevant MBM files are condensed into one consolidated block map (CBM) file that is stored with the incremental backup.

> Multiple block copier threads can be used to copy the modified blocks to the incremental backup directory. See the *Configuration* section of the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Installation and Upgrade Guide* for information about setting the `thread_count` parameter in the BART configuration file. See [Section - Backup](../../04_using_bart/03_basic_bart_subcommand_usage/03_backup/#backup) for using the `--thread-count` option with the `BACKUP` subcommand.

1.  Invoke the restore process for an incremental backup using the `RESTORE` subcommand in the same manner as restoring a full backup. The `-i` option specifies the backup identifier or name of the incremental backup to restore. The restore process begins by going back through the chain of past, parent incremental backups until the initial full backup starting the chain is identified. This full backup provides the initial set of directories and files to be restored to the location specified with the `-p` option. Each subsequent incremental backup in the chain is then restored. Restoration of an incremental backup uses its CBM file to restore the modified blocks from the incremental backup.

The following sections provide some additional information on these procedures.
