<div id="configuring_bart" class="registered_link"></div>

To configure the BART host and each database server that is to be managed by BART you must:

1.  Establish the BART user account and ensure it runs the `bart` and the `bart-scanner` program.

2.  Use the `bart.cfg.sample` file to create the `bart.cfg` file. The BART configuration file is located in *BART_HOME*/`etc/bart.cfg`:

    > `cp bart.cfg.sample bart.cfg`

3.  Set the environment variable for the BART user account. If the `libpq` library does not reside in the default installation location, you must add the `libpq` library to the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable and place the following settings in the BART user account’s profile so they take effect upon login:

<!-- -->

```
# .bash\_profile
# Get the aliases and functions
if [ -f ~/.bashrc ]; then
. ~/.bashrc
fi

# User specific environment and startup programs

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/edb/as11/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

1.  Set the following parameters in the `[BART]` section of the BART configuration file:

> **bart_host** (**required**)
>
> > Specify this parameter value in the form of `<bart_user>@<bart_host_address>`.
>
> **backup_path (required)**
>
> > Create the BART backup catalog and specify the path to the file system parent directory where BART database server backups and archived WAL files are stored. Ensure the BART user account owns the location specified in the `backup_path` parameter.
>
> **pg_basebackup_path** (**required**)
>
> > Specify the path to the `pg_basebackup` program on the BART host.
>
> **xlog_method (optional)**
>
> > Set to `fetch` (default) to collect the transaction log files after the backup is completed. Set to `stream` to stream the transaction log in parallel with the full backup creation.
>
> **retention_policy (optional)**
>
> > Specify when an active backup should be marked as obsolete when the `MANAGE` subcommand is used. Specify `max_number BACKUPS` (default setting), `max_number DAYS`, `max_number WEEKS`, or `max_number MONTHS` where `max_number` is a positive integer.
>
> **wal_compression (optional)**
>
> > Set to `enabled` to compress the archived WAL files in gzip format when the `MANAGE` subcommand is invoked. Please note: The gzip compression program must be in the BART user account’s `PATH`.
>
> **copy_wals_during_restore (optional)**
>
> > Set to `enabled` to copy the archived WAL files from the BART backup catalog to the *restore_path/archived_wals* directory prior to the database server archive recovery.
>
> **logfile (optional)**
>
> > Use `logfile` to specify the path to the location to which output from the bart program is written. The log file will be created the first time you invoke the bart command using the sample configuration file value.
>
> **scanner_logfile (optional)**
>
> > Use `scanner_logfile` to specify the path to the location to which output from the `bart-scanner` program is written. The scanner log file will be created the first time you invoke the `bart` command using the sample configuration file value.
>
> **thread_count (optional)**
>
> > Specify the number of worker threads to copy blocks from the database server to the BART backup catalog when the `BACKUP` subcommand is invoked for incremental backups.
> >
> > When taking a full backup, if the thread count is 1, then the `pg_basebackup` utility is used to take the full backup unless the `--no-pg_basebackup` option is specified with the `BACKUP` subcommand.
>
> **batch_size (optional)**
>
> > Specify the number of blocks of memory used for copying modified blocks from the database server to the BART backup catalog when the `BACKUP` subcommand is invoked for incremental backups. The maximum permitted value is 131072 (131072 \* 8192 = 1 GB). The minimum permitted value is 1 (1 \* 8192 = 8192 bytes).
>
> **scan_interval (optional)**
>
> > Specify the number of seconds before forcing a scan of the WAL files in the archive directory of the BART backup catalog. The default value is 0, which means no brute-force scanning will be started.
>
> **mbm_scan_timeout** **(optional)**
>
> > Specify the number of seconds to wait for MBM files before timing out; the default value is 20 seconds. The `mbm_scan_timeout` parameter value must be greater than 0. The `mbm_scan_timeout` parameter is applicable only for incremental backup.
>
> **workers (optional)**
>
> > Specify the number of parallel worker processes required to stream the modified blocks of an incremental backup to the restore host. The default value is `1`.

1.  Invoke the `CHECK-CONFIG` subcommand omitting the `-s` option to check the parameter settings in the BART configuration file including `bart_host`, `backup_path`, and `pg_basebackup_path`.
2.  Set the following parameters for each database server in the server section of the BART configuration file. The parameter setting in the server section overrides the setting in the global \[BART] section for that particular database server.

> **\[ServerName] (required)**
>
> > Specify a database server name.
>
> **backup_name (optional)**
>
> > Specify user-friendly name for the backups of the database server.
>
> **host (required)**
>
> > Specify the IP address of the database server to be configured for backup.
>
> **port (optional)**
>
> > Specify the port number identifying the database server instance to be backed up. The default is port `5444`.
>
> **user (required)**
>
> > Specify the replication database user name used by BART to establish the connection to the database server for full backups.
>
> **archive_command (optional)**
>
> > When the `INIT` subcommand is used, the content and variables specified in the BART `archive_command` result in the `archive command` string to be generated into the Postgres `archive_command` parameter in the `postgresql.auto.conf` file. The following information applies only to the BART `archive_command` parameter.
> >
> > > Enclose the command string within single quotes (').
> > >
> > > If the `archive_command` parameter is omitted, it still results in its usage by the `INIT` subcommand with a setting of `'scp %p %h:%a/%f'` where `%p` is the path of the file to archive used by the Postgres archiving process, `%h` is replaced by the `bart_host` parameter setting, `%a` is replaced by the BART archive path, and `%f` is the archived file name used by the Postgres archiving process.
>
> **cluster_owner (required)**
>
> > Specify the Linux operating system user account that owns the database cluster. This is typically `enterprisedb` for Advanced Server clusters installed in compatible mode, or `postgres` for PostgreSQL or Advanced Server clusters installed in the PostgreSQL compatible mode.
>
> **remote_host (optional)**
>
> > Specify this parameter value in the form of `<remote_user>@<remote_host_address>` where *remote_user* is the user account on the target database server host and *remote_host_address* is the IP address of the remote host.
>
> **tablespace_path (optional)**
>
> > Specify the path to which tablespaces are to be restored in the `OID = tablespace_path; OID = tablespace_path` … format. If the backup is to be restored to a remote host (specified by the `remote_host` parameter), then the tablespace must exist on the remote host.
>
> **allow_incremental_backups (optional)**
>
> > Set to `enabled` to permit incremental backups.
>
> **description (optional)**
>
> > Specify the database server description.
