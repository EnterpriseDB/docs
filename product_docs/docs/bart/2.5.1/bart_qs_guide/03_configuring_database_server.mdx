title: "Configuring a Database Server"
---



To configure a database server, you must:

1.  Authorize SSH/SCP access to the server.
2.  Create and configure a replication database user.
3.  Enable WAL archiving of the server.
4.  Verify the server configuration settings.

> **Note**: You must authorize SSH/SCP access and set up a replication database user before restarting the database server with WAL archiving enabled.

## Authorizing SSH/SCP Access

The following example enables SSH/SCP access on a CentOS 6.x host; similar (platform-specific) steps will apply to other platforms/versions.

1.  First, enable the usage of public key authentication:

    > a.  In the SSH server daemon configuration file `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`, ensure that the following parameter is set to `yes` and is not commented out:
    >
    >     `PubkeyAuthentication yes`
    >
    > b.  Reload the configuration file using the `service sshd reload`, `service sshd stop`, `service sshd start`, or `service sshd restart` command.

    > **Note**: If you get any SSH or SCP errors, examine the log file (`/var/log/secure`).

2.  Then, execute the following command to create a password-less connection:

    `ssh-copy-id target_user@host_address`

For more information about how to generate the authorized public key, see the *Authorized Public Keys Generation* section of the BART Installation and Upgrade Guide available at:

## Setting up a Replication Database User

To set up a replication database user:

1.  Choose a database user to serve as the *replication database user* (a superuser) for each Postgres database server to be managed by BART.
2.  Modify the `pg_hba.conf` file to allow the replication database user to access the `template1` database. Include the replication database user in the `pg_hba.conf` file as a `replication` connection if `pg_basebackup` is to be used for taking any backups.
3.  Specify the replication database user for the database server in the BART configuration file in the `user` parameter.

## Enabling WAL Archiving

To enable WAL archiving, set the following parameters in the `postgresql.conf` file for any database server for which BART is to perform a backup. Set:

-   `wal_level` to `archive` for Postgres 9.5 or to `replica` for Postgres 9.6 or later.
-   `archive_mode` to on.
-   `archive_command` to copy the WAL files to the BART backup catalog.
-   `max_wal_senders` to a value high enough to leave at least one session available for the backup. If the `xlog_method=stream` parameter setting is to be used by this server, the `max_wal_senders` setting must account for an additional session for transaction log streaming.

> **Note**: Run the `INIT` subcommand with the `-o` option to override any existing `archive_command` setting in the `postgresql.conf` or the `postgresql.auto.conf` file.

1.  After verifying that the full path of the BART backup catalog has been created, restart the database server to initiate WAL archiving.

2.  Start the WAL scanner by executing the following command:

    > `./bart-scanner`

## Verifying Configuration Setting

-   Use the `CHECK-CONFIG` subcommand with the `–s` option to verify the parameter settings in the database server configuration for which the `-s` option is specified.

    > `bart CHECK-CONFIG` \[ `–s` *&lt;server\_name&gt;* \]

In addition, the following `postgresql.conf` parameters for the database server must be properly set and activated for certain processes:

-   The `cluster_owner` parameter must be set to the user account owning the database cluster directory.
-   A password-less SSH/SCP connection must be set between the BART user and the user account specified by the `cluster_owner` parameter.
-   The BART `user` parameter must specify a database superuser.
-   The `pg_hba.conf` file must contain a replication entry for the database superuser specified by the BART `user` parameter.
-   The `archive_mode` parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file must be enabled.
-   The `archive_command` parameter in the `postgresql.auto.conf` or the `postgresql.conf` file must be set.
-   The `allow_incremental_backups` parameter in the BART configuration file must be enabled for database servers for which incremental backups are to be taken.
-   Archiving of WAL files to the BART backup catalog must be in process.
-   The WAL scanner program must be running.
