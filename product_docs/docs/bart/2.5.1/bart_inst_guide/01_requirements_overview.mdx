The following sections detail the requirement for BART installation.

## Supported Platforms

BART 2.5.1 can be installed on the following 64-bit platforms:

-   CentOS 6.x or 7.x
-   Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 6.x or 7.x
-   PPC-LE 8 running RHEL or CentOS 7.x
-   Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic)
-   Debian 9.x (Stretch)

## Supported Database Versions

BART 2.5.1 supports the following database versions:

-   Advanced Server versions 9.5, 9.6, 10, 11, 12
-   PostgreSQL versions 9.5, 9.6, 10, 11, 12

## Software Requirements

The following sections detail the components required for BART installation.



**\`BART Host Components\`**

Use EnterpriseDB packages to add BART host components; see [Installing BART using an RPM Package](#installing_bart_using_an_rpm_package) for installation instructions.



**Additional Components**

In addition to the BART host components, the following components must be enabled and activated:

-   The Secure Shell (SSH) server daemon must be enabled and activated on the BART host as well as on any remote database server hosts on which BART will be managing backup and recovery.
-   The SSH and Secure Copy (SCP) client programs must be available on the BART host as well as on the remote database server hosts.

See <span class="title-ref">Authorizing SSH/SCP Access &lt;authorizing\_ssh/scp\_access&gt;</span> for information about installing an configuring SSH and SCP.

BART uses the `pg_basebackup` utility program when taking full backups. Your `pg_basebackup` version must be the same or more recent than the database server to be backed up. For example, `pg_basebackup` version 10 can back up database server version 10, but cannot be used to back up database server version 11.

### Limitations

-   BART can take backups from database clusters with a WAL segment file size other than the default size of 16 MB. You can use the Advanced Server `initdb --wal-segsize` option to modify the WAL segment file size.

    For information about using the Advanced Server `initdb --wal-segsize` option, see the *Customizable WAL Segment File Size* section in the EDB Postgres Advanced Server User Guide, available at:

    > <https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/>

-   BART only supports taking a full backup of standby servers. Incremental backups and parallel backups cannot be taken from standby servers.
