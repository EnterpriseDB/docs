title: "CHECK-CONFIG"
---



The `CHECK-CONFIG` subcommand checks the parameter settings in the BART configuration file as well as the database server configuration for which the `-s` option is specified.

**Syntax:**

    bart CHECK-CONFIG [ –s <server_name> ]

In the above syntax diagram, `CHECK-CONFIG` is the BART subcommand and `–s <server_name>` is the subcommand option.

**Option**

`-s` (or `--server) <server_name>`

`<server_name>` is the name of the database server whose configuration parameter settings are to be checked. If you do not specify the `<server_name>`, the settings of the BART configuration file global section are checked.

**Example**

The following example demonstrates a bart `CHECK-CONFIG` command without the `–s` option. It successfully checks the global section of the BART configuration file:

    bash-4.1$ bart CHECK-CONFIG
    INFO: Verifying that pg_basebackup is executable
    INFO: success -
    INFO: success - pg_basebackup(/usr/edb/as11/bin/pg_basebackup) returns
    version 11.400000

The following example demonstrates executing a bart `CHECK-CONFIG` command with the `–s` option. It successfully checks the database server parameter settings:

    [edb@localhost bin]$ ./bart check-config -s hr
    INFO: Checking server hr
    INFO: Verifying cluster_owner and ssh/scp connectivity
    INFO: success
