title: "Restoring an Incremental Backup"
---

Restoring an incremental backup may require additional setup steps depending upon the host on which the incremental backup is to be restored. For more information, see Restoring an Incremental Backup section of the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery User Guide* available at:

> <https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/>

This section provides an example of creating backup chains and then restoring an incremental backup.

**Creating a Backup Chain**

A *backup chain* is the set of backups consisting of a full backup and all of its successive incremental backups. Tracing back on the parent backups of all incremental backups in the chain eventually leads back to that single, full backup.

In the following example, the `allow_incremental_backups` parameter is set to `enabled` in the BART configuration file to permit incremental backups on the listed database server:

```
[BART]

bart_host= enterprisedb@192.168.2.27
backup_path = /opt/backup
pg_basebackup_path = /usr/edb/as11/bin/pg_basebackup
logfile = /tmp/bart.log
scanner_logfile = /tmp/bart_scanner.log

[ACCTG]

host = 127.0.0.1
port = 5445
user = enterprisedb
cluster_owner = enterprisedb
allow_incremental_backups = enabled
description = "Accounting"
```

After the database server has been started with WAL archiving enabled to the BART backup catalog, the WAL scanner is started:

```
-bash-4.2$ bart-scanner --daemon
```

First, a full backup is taken.

```
-bash-4.2$ bart BACKUP -s acctg --backup-name full_1

```

A series of incremental backups are taken. The first incremental backup specifies the full backup as the parent. Each successive incremental backup then uses the preceding incremental backup as its parent.

The following output of the `SHOW-BACKUPS` subcommand lists the backup chain, which are backups `full_1, incr_1-a, incr_1-b, and incr_1-c`.

```
-bash-4.2$ bart SHOW-BACKUPS -s acctg
SERVER NAME BACKUP ID BACKUP NAME BACKUP PARENT BACKUP TIME ...

```

Note

</div>

For the `full backup full_1`, the `BACKUP PARENT` field contains `none`. For each incremental backup, the `BACKUP PARENT` field contains the backup identifier or name of its parent backup.

</div>

A second backup chain is created in the same manner with the `BACKUP` subcommand. The following example shows the addition of the resulting, second backup chain consisting of full backup `full_2` and incremental backups `incr_2-a` and `incr_2-b`.

```
-bash-4.2$ bart SHOW-BACKUPS -s acctg
SERVER NAME BACKUP ID     BACKUP NAME  BACKUP PARENT  BACKUP TIME ...
acctg       1490649605607 incr_2-b     incr_2-a       2017-03-27 17:20:06 ...

```

The following additional incremental backups starting with `incr_1-b-1`, which designates `incr_1-b` as the parent, results in the forking from that backup into a second line of backups in the chain consisting of `full_1, incr_1-a, incr_1-b, incr_1-b-1, incr_1-b-2`, and `incr_1-b-3` as shown in the following list:

```
-bash-4.2$ bart SHOW-BACKUPS -s acctg

acctg        1490649791430 incr_1-b-3    incr_1-b-2      2017-03-27 17:23:12 ...

```

**Restoring an Incremental Backup**

Restoring an incremental backup is done with the `RESTORE` subcommand in the same manner as for restoring a full backup. Specify the backup identifier or backup name of the incremental backup to be restored as shown in the following example.

```
-bash-4.2$ bart RESTORE -s acctg -p /opt/restore -i incr_1-b
INFO: restoring incremental backup 'incr_1-b' of server 'acctg'
INFO: base backup restored
INFO: archiving is disabled
INFO: permissions set on $PGDATA
INFO: incremental restore completed successfully
```

Restoring incremental backup `incr_1-b` as shown by the preceding example results in the restoration of full backup `full_1`, then incremental backups `incr_1-a` and finally, `incr_1-b`.
