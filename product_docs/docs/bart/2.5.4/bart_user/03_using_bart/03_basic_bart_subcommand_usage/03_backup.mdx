The `BACKUP` subcommand is used to create a full backup or an incremental backup.

**Syntax for full backup:**

``` text
bart BACKUP –s { <server_name> | all } [ -F { p | t } ]
  [ -z ] [ –c <compression_level> ]
  [ --backup-name <backup_name> ]
  [ --thread-count <number_of_threads> ]
  [ { --with-pg_basebackup | --no-pg_basebackup } ]
```

</div>

While taking a backup, if a file (for example, database server log file) exceeding 1 GB size is stored in the `$PGDATA` directory, the backup will fail. To avoid such backup failure, you need to store large files (exceeding 1 GB) outside the `$PGDATA` directory.

</div>

**Syntax for incremental Backup:**

``` text
bart BACKUP –s { <server_name> | all } [ -F p]
 [ --parent { <backup_id> | <backup_name> } ]
  [ --backup-name <backup_name> ]
  [ --thread-count <number_of_threads> ]
  [ --check ]
```

To take an [incremental backup](../../02_overview/01_block-level_incremental_backup/#block-level_incremental_backup), you must take a full backup first followed by incremental backup.

</div>

**Please Note:**

  - While a `BACKUP` subcommand is in progress, no other subcommands must be invoked. Any subcommands invoked while a backup is in progress will skip and ignore the backups.
  - For full backup, the target default format is a tar file, whereas for incremental backup, only plain format must be specified.
  - The backup is saved in the `<backup_path>/<server_name>/<backup_id>` directory, where `<backup_path>` is the value assigned to the `<backup_path>` parameter in the BART configuration file, `<server_name>` is the lowercase name of the database server as listed in the configuration file, and `<backup_id>` is a backup identifier assigned by BART to the particular backup.
  - MD5 checksums of the full backup and any user-defined tablespaces are saved as well for tar backups.
  - Before performing the backup, BART checks to ensure if there is enough disk space to completely store the backup in the BART backup catalog.
  - In the `postgresql.conf` file, ensure the `wal_keep_segments` configuration parameter is set to a sufficiently large value. A low setting of the `wal_keep_segments` configuration parameter may result in the deletion of some WAL files before the BART `BACKUP` subcommand saves them to the `archive_path`. For information about the `wal_keep_segments` parameter, see the [PostgreSQL Core Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-replication.html).
  - If in the BART configuration file, parameter setting `xlog_method=stream` applies to a given database server, streaming of the transaction log in parallel with creation of the backup is performed for that database server, otherwise the transaction log files are collected upon completion of the backup. See the *EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Installation and Upgrade Guide* for details about database server setting.

  - When you use BART to take a backup of:
      - PostgreSQL server version 9.5 or prior, only one backup per server may be in progress at any given time and if a backup is interrupted, you must manually run the `pg_stop_backup()` command to terminate the backup mode.
      - PostgreSQL server version 9.6 or higher, multiple backups can be taken simultaneously and if a backup is interrupted, the backup mode is terminated automatically without the need to run `pg_stop_backup()` command manually to terminate the backup.

**Options**

Along with the `BACKUP` subcommand, specify the following option:

| Options                                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

| `-s` or `--server { server_name \| all }` | | `server_name` is the database server name to be backed up as specified in the BART configuration file. If `all` is specified, all servers are backed up. This option is mandatory. | If `all` is specified, and a connection to a database server listed in the BART configuration file cannot be opened, the backup for that database server is skipped, but the backup operation continues for the other database servers. |

Specify the following options as required. If you do not specify any of the following options, the backup is created using default settings.

| Options                                                                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

**--backup-name Examples**

The following examples demonstrate using the --backup-name clause:

``` text
./bart backup -s ppas12 -Ft --backup-name "YEAR = %year
MONTH = %month DAY = %day"
./bart backup -s ppas12 -Ft --backup-name "YEAR = %year
MONTH = %month DAY = %day %%"
./bart show-backups -s ppas12 -i "test backup"
```
