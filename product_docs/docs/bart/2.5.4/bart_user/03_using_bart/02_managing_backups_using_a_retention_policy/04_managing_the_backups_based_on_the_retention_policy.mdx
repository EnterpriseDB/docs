<div id="managing_the_backups_based_on_the_retention_policy" class="registered_link"></div>


The [MANAGE](../../03_using_bart/03_basic_bart_subcommand_usage/#manage) subcommand is used to evaluate and categorize backups according to the retention policy set in the BART configuration file. When a backup is first created with the `BACKUP` subcommand, it is `active`. You can use the `MANAGE` subcommand to change the status of an active backup to `obsolete`. Obsolete backups can then be deleted.

This section covers following aspects of backup management:

  - The rules for [deleting backups](../../03_using_bart/02_managing_backups_using_a_retention_policy/#deletions_permitted_under_retention_policy) depending upon the backup status and the subcommand used.
  - The process to retain a backup indefinitely by [marking it as keep](../../03_using_bart/02_managing_backups_using_a_retention_policy/#marking_backups_for_indefinite_keep_status). This section also provides information about resetting backups status (that are marked as `obsolete` and `keep`) back to active status.
  - The general process for <span class="title-ref">evaluating, marking, and then deleting obsolete backups \<evaluating_marking_and_deleting_obsolete_backups\></span>.

## Deletions Permitted Under a Retention Policy



This section describes how and under what conditions backups may be deleted under a retention policy.

You must use the `MANAGE` subcommand to delete obsolete backups. Use the `DELETE` subcommand only for special administrative purposes.

The deletion behavior of the `MANAGE` subcommand and the `DELETE` subcommand are based on different aspects of the retention policy.

  - The `MANAGE` subcommand deletion relies solely upon how a backup status is currently marked (that is, internally recorded by BART). The current setting of the `retention_policy` parameter in the BART configuration file is ignored.
  - The `DELETE` subcommand relies solely upon the current setting of the `retention_policy` parameter in the BART configuration file. The current active, obsolete, or keep status of a backup is ignored.

The specific deletion rules for the `MANAGE` and `DELETE` subcommands are as follows:

  - `MANAGE` subcommand: The `MANAGE` subcommand with the `-d` option can only delete backups marked as obsolete. This deletion occurs regardless of the current `retention_policy` setting in the BART configuration file. The deletion of backups relies on the last occasion when the backups have been marked.
  - `DELETE` subcommand:
      - Under a redundancy retention policy currently set with the `retention_policy` parameter in the BART configuration file, any backup regardless of its marked status, can be deleted with the `DELETE` subcommand when the backup identifier or name is specified with the `-i` option and if the current total number of backups for the specified database server is greater than the maximum number of redundancy backups currently specified with the `retention_policy` parameter.
        
        If the total number of backups is less than or equal to the specified, maximum number of redundancy backups, then no additional backups can be deleted using `DELETE` with the `-i backup` option.
    
      - Under a recovery window retention policy currently set with the `retention_policy` parameter in the BART configuration file, any backup regardless of its marked status, can be deleted with the `DELETE` subcommand when the backup identifier or name is specified with the `-i` option, and if the backup date/time is not within the recovery window currently specified with the `retention_policy` parameter. If the backup date/time is within the recovery window, then it cannot be deleted using `DELETE` with the `-i backup` option.
    
      - Invoking the `DELETE` subcommand with the `-i all` option results in the deletion of all backups regardless of the retention policy and regardless of whether the status is marked as active, obsolete, or keep.

The following table summarizes the deletion rules of backups according to their marked status. An entry of `Yes` indicates the backup may be deleted under the specified circumstances. An entry of `No` indicates that the backup may not be deleted.

## Marking Backups for Indefinite Keep Status



There may be certain backups that you wish to keep for an indefinite period of time and do not wish to delete based upon the retention policy applied to the database server. Such backups can be marked as `keep` to exclude them from being marked as obsolete. Use the `MANAGE` subcommand with the `-c` keep option to retain such backups indefinitely.

<div id="evaluating_marking_and_deleting_obsolete_backups" class="registered_link"></div>

## Evaluating, Marking, and Deleting Obsolete Backups







When the `MANAGE` subcommand is invoked, BART evaluates active backups:

  - If you include the `-s` option when invoking the `MANAGE` subcommand, BART evaluates backups for the database server.
  - If you include the `-s all` option when invoking the `MANAGE` subcommand, BART evaluates backups for all database servers.
  - If the `-s` option is omitted, the command evaluates the current number of backups for the database server based on the redundancy retention policy or the current date/time for a recovery window retention policy.

</div>

The status of backups currently marked as `obsolete` or `keep` is not changed. To re-evaluate such backups and then classify them, their status must first be reset to `active` with the `MANAGE -c nokeep` option. See [Marking the Backup Status](../../03_using_bart/02_managing_backups_using_a_retention_policy/#marking_the_backup_status) for more information.
