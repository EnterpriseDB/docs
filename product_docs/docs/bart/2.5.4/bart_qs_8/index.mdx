title: "Quick Start Guide for RHEL/CentOS 8"
---



This tutorial demonstrates using the `dnf` command to install the EDB Backup and Recovery Tool (BART) 2.5.4 on a RHEL or CentOS 8 host. Â The tutorial assumes that the user has some knowledge of installation and system administration procedures, and administrative privileges on the host. It provides shortcuts that allow you to install and configure BART with minimal configuration settings.

For detailed information about BART installation and configuration, see the [BART Installation and Upgrade Guide.](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs)

  - BART is tested with the following database versions:

    >   - Advanced Server - 9.5, 9.6, 10, 11, and 12.
    >   - PostgreSQL - 9.5, 9.6, 10, 11, and 12.

**Installing BART**

The following steps describe installing BART on CentOS 8.x OS.

1.  Assume superuser privileges and use `dnf` to create the repository configuration file:

    ``` text
    dnf install -y https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

2.  To request credentials to the EDB repository, [visit the EnterpriseDB website.](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request)

3.  Use your choice of editor to open the repository configuration file (named `edb.repo`, located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`) and set the value of the `enabled` parameter to `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the username and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

4.  Then, install an Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database server. Initialize the cluster and start the server. Note that the BART host server is not required to have a Postgres (Advanced Server or PostgreSQL) installation, but must include a copy of the Postgres `libpq` library, the `pg_basebackup` utility program, and Boost Libraries 1.48 version for RHEL/CentOS 6, 1.53 version for RHEL/CentOS 7, and 1.66 version for RHEL/CentOS 8.

5.  Optionally, if you do not already have the `pg_basebackup` program installed on the BART host, you can install a limited number of files that include the `pg_basebackup` program using the following command:

    ``` text
    dnf install edb-asxx-server-client
    ```

6.  Then, use the following command to install the BART RPM package:

    ``` text
    dnf install edb-bart
    ```

BART (the `bart` program and `bart-scanner`) is installed in the `/usr/edb/bart` directory, referred to as `<BART_HOME>`. Repeat the installation process described in this section to install BART on all remote hosts where incremental backups are to be restored.

**Configuring BART**

Before configuring BART, establish the BART user account (the operating system user) that will run the BART command line program.

To configure the BART host and each database server that is to be managed by BART, perform the following steps:

1.  Assume superuser privileges, create the directory that will hold the BART backup catalog, and assign its ownership (with restrictive privileges) to the BART user account:

    ``` text
    su root
    mkdir /opt/backup
    chown bartuser /opt/backup
    chgrp bartuser /opt/backup
    chmod 700 /opt/backup
    ```

In the example, `bartuser` is the BART user account and `/opt/backup` is the BART backup catalog.

2.  Navigate to the `/usr/edb/bart/etc` directory and copy the `bart.cfg.sample` file to create the bart configuration file (`bart.cfg`):

>
>
> ``` text
> cp bart.cfg.sample bart.cfg
> ```

3.  Open the BART configuration file (`bart.cfg`) using an editor of your choice. Scroll through the BART configuration file and edit the sections as required; example settings are included for your reference. You must add the mandatory parameters to both the sections as described in the following table. Default values may be used for optional parameters; for detailed information about parameter settings, see the [BART Installation and Upgrade Guide.](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs)

    Parameters set in the `[BART]` section are applicable to all BART managed database servers, and the parameters set in the `[ServerName]` section are applicable only to the specific server; the `[ServerName]` setting overrides the `[BART]` section setting.

| **Parameters/Placeholder** | **Section**    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `bart_host`                | `[BART]`       | Use this field to specify the BART user and the IP address of the host on which the BART utility is installed. Specify the value in the form of `<bart_user>@<bart_host_address>`.                                                                                                                                |
| `backup_path`              | `[BART]`       | Use this field to specify the path where all BART backups and archived WAL files will be stored. Ensure the BART user account holds privileges to create subdirectories and files within the location specified in the `backup_path` parameter. The default `backup_path` is BART backup catalog (`/opt/backup`). |
| `pg_basebackup_path`       | `[BART]`       | Use this field to specify the path to the pg_basebackup utility (`/usr/edb/as<xx>/bin/pg_basebackup`).                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `[ServerName]`             | `[ServerName]` | Specify the name of the database server to be backed up (for example, \[EPAS12\]).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `host`                     | `[ServerName]` | Specify the IP address of the database server to be configured for backup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `port`                     | `[ServerName]` | | Specify the port number identifying the database server instance to be backed up. The default port number for EPAS is `5444` and for Postgres it is `5432`. | The port parameter setting is only required if the database server listens on a port other than the default value.                                |
| `user`                     | `[ServerName]` | Specify the replication database user name used by BART to establish the connection to the database server for full backups.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `cluster_owner`            | `[ServerName]` | Specify the Linux operating system user account that owns the database cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

In the following example, only mandatory parameters are set:

>
>
> ``` text
> [BART]
> bart_host= bartuser@192.168.169.199
> backup_path = /opt/backup
> pg_basebackup_path = /usr/edb/as12/bin/pg_basebackup
>
> [EPAS12]
> host = 127.0.0.1
> user = repuser
> cluster_owner = enterprisedb
> ```

4.  As the BART user, navigate to the `/usr/edb/bart/bin` directory and invoke the following subcommand (omitting the `-s` option) to verify the \[BART\] section parameter settings in the BART configuration file:

    ``` text
    bart CHECK-CONFIG
    ```

5.  <span class="title-ref">Authorize SSH/SCP access passwordless</span> between the server and the BART host without a password prompt.

6.  Create a [replication database user](#replication) for each database server that BART manages.

7.  To enable continuous WAL archiving for any database server for which BART is to perform a backup, in the `postgresql.conf` file set the `wal_level` to `archive` for Postgres 9.5 or to `replica` for Postgres 9.6 or later, set the `archive_mode` to `on`, set the `archive_command` (if it is not set in the `bart.cfg` file), and set the `max_wal_senders` to a value high enough to leave at least one session available for the backup, and restart the database server.

8.  To start the WAL scanner, navigate to the `/usr/edb/bart/bin` directory as a BART user and execute the following command:

    ``` text
    ./bart-scanner
    ```

9.  If you are using the default `archive_command`, then navigate to the `/usr/edb/bart` directory as a BART user, run the `INIT` subcommand without the `-o` option, and restart the database server:

    ``` text
    bart INIT [ -s { <server_name> | all } ]
    ```

    Where `<server_name>` is the name of the database server to be backed up.

    If you have customized the `archive_command` setting in the `bart.cfg` file, run the `INIT` subcommand with the `-o` option to override any existing Postgresql `archive_command` setting in the `postgresql.conf` or the `postgresql.auto.conf` file, and restart the database server:

    ``` text
    bart INIT [ -s { <server_name> | all } ] [ -o ]
    ```

10. To verify the parameter settings of the database server, as a BART user navigate to the `/usr/edb/bart/bin` directory and invoke the `CHECK-CONFIG` subcommand with the -s option:

>
>
> ``` text
> bart CHECK-CONFIG [ -s <server_name> ]
> ```
>
> BART is now configured successfully. For detailed information about using BART, see the [EDB Backup and Recovery Tool User Guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/).

<div id="passwordless" class="registered_link"></div>

**Creating a Passwordless Connection**

The following example enables SSH/SCP access on a CentOS 8.x host; similar (platform-specific) steps will apply to other platforms/versions. You must create a passwordless connection between the BART host (SSH/SCP client) and the database server (target SSH/SCP server), as well as a passwordless connection between the database server (SSH/SCP client) and the BART host (target SSH/SCP server).

1.  Log in as the user account on the BART host that will be initiating the SSH or SCP connection and navigate to the user accountâs home directory and check for an existing `.ssh` subdirectory. If the `.ssh` directory does not exist, create one with the required privileges.

2.  As a root user navigate to the `/usr/edb/bart` directory, open the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file and set the `PubkeyAuthentication` parameter to `yes`.

3.  Reload the configuration file:

    ``` text
    service sshd reload
    ```

> If you get any SSH or SCP errors, examine the log file (`/var/log/secure`).

4.  As a BART user, use the following command to generate the public key file; you can accept the default responses:

    ``` text
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
    ```

    The public key file named `id_rsa.pub` is created in the `.ssh` subdirectory.

5.  Use `SCP` to make a temporary copy of the public key file on the target server:

    ``` text
    scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub target_user@host_address:tmp.pub
    ```

6.  As a `target_user`, log into the target server using `ssh target_user@host_address` command and navigate to the user accountâs home directory to check if there is an existing `.ssh` subdirectory. If it does not exist, create one with the required privileges.

7.  Append the temporary clientâs public key file, `tmp.pub`, to the authorized keys file named `authorized_keys`:

    ``` text
    cat tmp.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

    If an authorized keys file does not exist, create a new file, but be careful not completely replace any existing authorized keys file.

8.  Ensure the `authorized_keys` file is only accessible by the file owner, and not by groups or other users:

    ``` text
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

9.  Delete the temporary public key file:

    ``` text
    rm tmp.pub
    ```

    Now, when logged into the BART host as a user, there should be no prompt for a password when you are connecting to the target database server:

    ``` text
    ssh target_user@database_server_address
    ```

**Creating a Passwordless Connection Between the Database Server and the BART Host**

1.  On the database server, navigate into the target user accountâs home directory to check for an existing `.ssh` subdirectory. If it does does not exist, create one in the user accountâs home directory with the required privileges.

2.  As a database server user, generate the public key file:

    ``` text
    ssh-keygen -t rsa
    ```

3.  Create a temporary copy of the public key file:

    ``` text
    scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub target_user@host_address:tmp.pub
    ```

4.  As a target user, log into the BART host and navigate to the user accountâs home directory to check if there is an existing `.ssh` subdirectory. If it does not exist, create one with the required privileges:

    ``` text
    ssh target_user@host_address
    ```

5.  Append the temporary, clientâs public key file to the `authorized_keys` file:

    ``` text
    cat tmp.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

If an authorized keys file does not exist, create a new file, but do not completely replace any existing authorized keys file.

6.  Ensure the `authorized_keys` file is only accessible by the file owner and not by groups or other users (`chmod 600`):

    ``` text
    chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
    ```

7.  Delete the temporary public key file:

    ``` text
    rm tmp.pub
    ```

    Now, when logged into the database server as a user, there should be no prompt for a password when you are connecting to the BART host:

>
>
> ``` text
> ssh bart_user@bartip_address
> ```

  - If backups are to be taken from a given database server host, but restored to a different database server host, the passwordless SSH/SCP connections must be configured from the BART host to the database server host from which the backup is to be taken as well as from the BART host to the database server host to which the backup is to be restored.

> For examples of creating a passwordless connection, see the [EDB Postgres Backup and Recovery Reference Guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/)

  - Even when the Advanced Server database is on the same host as BART, and the Advanced Server database cluster owner is also the BART user account, a passwordless SSH/SCP connection must be established from the same user account to itself.

<div id="replication" class="registered_link"></div>

**Creating a Replication Database User**

1.  To create a replication database user (a superuser), connect to the database server with the psql client, and invoke the following PostgreSQL command:

    ``` text
    CREATE ROLE <repuser> WITH LOGIN SUPERUSER PASSWORD '<password>';
    ```

2.  Specify this replication database user in the `user` parameter of the `bart.cfg` file.

3.  The [pg_hba.conf](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html) file must minimally permit the replication database user to have access to the database. The IP address from which the replication database user has access to the database is the BART host location. The replication database user must also be included in the `pg_hba.conf` file as a replication database connection if `pg_basebackup` is to be used for taking any backups.

4.  To ensure there is no password prompt when connecting to the database server with the replication database user, a recommended method is to use the `.pgpass` file located in the BART user accountâs home directory (if it does not exist, you need to create the `.pgpass` file with the required privileges). The `.pgpass` file must contain an entry for each BART managed database server, and its corresponding replication database user and password.

    The following is an example of an entry in the `.pgpass` file (192.168.2.24 is the IP address of the database server):

    ``` text
    192.168.2.24:5444::repuser:password
    ```
