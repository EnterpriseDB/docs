<div id="a_sample_bart_system_with_local_and_remote_database_servers" class="registered_link"></div>

This section describes a sample BART managed backup and recovery system consisting of both local and remote database servers. The complete steps to configure and operate the system are provided.

For detailed information about configuring a BART system, see the *EDB Backup and Recovery Installation and Upgrade Guide*. For detailed information about the operational procedures and BART subcommands, see the *EDB Backup and Recovery User Guide*. These guides are available at the [EDB website](/bart/latest/bart_inst/).

The environment for this sample system is as follows:

-   BART on host `192.168.2.22` running with BART user account `enterprisedb`
-   Local Advanced Server on host `192.168.2.22` running with user account `enterprisedb`
-   Remote Advanced Server on host `192.168.2.24` running with user account `enterprisedb`
-   Remote PostgreSQL server on host `192.168.2.24` running with user account `postgres`

Passwordless SSH/SCP connections are required between the following:

-   BART on host `192.168.2.22` and the local Advanced Server on the same host `192.168.2.22`
-   BART on host `192.168.2.22` and the remote Advanced Server on host `192.168.2.24`
-   BART on host `192.168.2.22` and the remote PostgreSQL server on host `192.168.2.24`

The following sections demonstrate configuring and taking full backups only. To support incremental backups as well, enable the `allow_incremental_backups` parameter for the desired database servers and use the `WAL scanner` program.

-   [The BART Configuration File](#bart_configuration_file) shows the settings used in the BART configuration file.
-   [Establishing SSH/SCP Passwordless Connections](#establishing-sshscp-passwordless-connections) provides an example of how to establish an SSH/SCP passwordless connection.
-   [Configuring a Replication Database User](#configuring-a-replication-database-user) provides an example of how to configure the replication database user.
-   [WAL Archiving Configuration Parameters](#wal-archiving-configuration-parameters) provides an example of how to configure WAL archiving.
-   [Creating the BART Backup Catalog](#creating-the-bart-backup-catalog-backup_path) provides information about creating a BART Backup Catalog.
-   [Starting the Database Servers with WAL Archiving](#starting-the-database-servers-with-wal-archiving) provides example of starting the database servers with WAL archiving.
-   [Taking a Full Backup](#taking-a-full-backup) illustrates taking the first full backup of the database servers.
-   [Using Point-In-Time Recovery](#using-point-in-time-recovery) demonstrates the point-in-time recovery operation on the remote PostgreSQL database server.

## Establishing SSH/SCP Passwordless Connections

This section demonstrates how passwordless SSH/SCP connections are established with the authorized public keys files.

<div id="generating_a_public_key_file_for_the_bart_user_account" class="registered_link"></div>

### Generating a Public Key File for the BART User Account

The BART user account is `enterprisedb` with a home directory of `/opt/PostgresPlus/9.6AS`.

To generate the public key file, as a root user, first create the `.ssh` subdirectory in the BART user’s home directory and assign ownership of this directory to the `enterprisedb` user, ensuring there are no groups or other users that can access the `.ssh` directory.

```text
[root@localhost 9.6AS]# pwd
/opt/PostgresPlus/9.6AS
[root@localhost 9.6AS]# mkdir .ssh
[root@localhost 9.6AS]# chown enterprisedb .ssh
[root@localhost 9.6AS]# chgrp enterprisedb .ssh
[root@localhost 9.6AS]# chmod 700 .ssh
[root@localhost 9.6AS]# ls -la | grep ssh
drwx------ 2 enterprisedb enterprisedb 4096 Apr 23 13:02 .ssh
```

Generate the public key file:

```text
[user@localhost ~]$ su - enterprisedb
Password:
-bash-4.1$ pwd
/opt/PostgresPlus/9.6AS
-bash-4.1$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key
(/opt/PostgresPlus/9.6AS/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in
/opt/PostgresPlus/9.6AS/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in
/opt/PostgresPlus/9.6AS/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
de:65:34:d6:b1:d2:32:3c:b0:43:c6:a3:c0:9f:f4:64
enterprisedb@localhost.localdomain
The key's randomart image is:
+----[ RSA 2048]----+
|       .   .+   .  |
|        o .oE+ o o |
|         + * o.X + |
|          + .+ *   |
|          S   o    |
|         . . o     |
|          . .      |
|
       |
|                   |
+-------------------+
```

The following are the resulting files. `id_rsa.pub` is the public key file of BART user account `enterprisedb`.

```text
-bash-4.1$ ls -l .ssh
total 8
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 1675 Apr 23 13:04 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 416 Apr 23 13:04 id_rsa.pub
```

### Configuring Access between Local Advanced Server and the BART Host

Even when the Advanced Server database is on the same host as the BART user account, and the Advanced Server database cluster owner is also the BART user account (`enterprisedb` is this case), a passwordless SSH/SCP connection must be established from the same user account to itself.

On the BART host where the public key file was just generated (as shown in [Generating a Public Key File for the BART User Account](#generating-a-public-key-file-for-the-bart-user-account)), create the authorized keys file by appending the public key file to any existing authorized keys file.

Log into the BART host as the BART user account and append the public key file, `id_rsa.pub` onto the `authorized_keys` file in the same `.ssh` directory.

```text
[user@localhost ~]$ su - enterprisedb
Password:
Last login: Thu Mar 23 10:27:35 EDT 2017 on pts/0
-bash-4.2$ pwd
/opt/PostgresPlus/9.6AS
-bash-4.2$ ls -l .ssh
total 12
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 1675 Mar 23 09:54 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 416 Mar 23 09:54 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 345 Mar 23 10:05 known_hosts
-bash-4.2$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
-bash-4.2$ ls -l .ssh
total 16
-rw-rw-r-- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 416 Mar 23 10:33 authorized_keys
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 1675 Mar 23 09:54 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 416 Mar 23 09:54 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 345 Mar 23 10:05 known_hosts
```

The `authorized_keys` file must have file permission `600` as set by the following `chmod 600` command, or the passwordless connection will fail:

```text
-bash-4.2$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
-bash-4.2$ ls -l .ssh
total 16
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 416 Mar 23 10:33 authorized_keys
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 1675 Mar 23 09:54 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 416 Mar 23 09:54 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 345 Mar 23 10:05 known_hosts
```

Test the passwordless connection. Use the `ssh` command to verify that you can access the same user account as you are currently logged in as (`enterprisedb`) without being prompted for a password:

```text
-bash-4.2$ ssh enterprisedb@127.0.0.1
Last login: Thu Mar 23 10:27:50 2017
-bash-4.2$ exit
logout
Connection to 127.0.0.1 closed.
```

### Configuring Access from Remote Advanced Server to BART Host

On the remote host `192.168.2.24`, create the public key file for the remote database server user account, `enterprisedb`, for access to the BART user account, `enterprisedb`, on the BART host 192.168.2.22.

Create the `.ssh` directory for user account `enterprisedb` on the remote host:

```text
[root@localhost 9.6AS]# pwd
/opt/PostgresPlus/9.6AS
[root@localhost 9.6AS]# mkdir .ssh
[root@localhost 9.6AS]# chown enterprisedb .ssh
[root@localhost 9.6AS]# chgrp enterprisedb .ssh
[root@localhost 9.6AS]# chmod 700 .ssh
[root@localhost 9.6AS]# ls -la | grep ssh
drwx------ 2 enterprisedb enterprisedb 4096 Apr 23 13:08 .ssh
```

Generate the public key file on the remote host for user account `enterprisedb`:

```text
[user@localhost ~]$ su - enterprisedb
Password:
-bash-4.1$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key

The key fingerprint is:
15:27:1e:1e:61:4b:48:66:67:0b:b2:be:fc:ea:ea:e6
enterprisedb@localhost.localdomain
The key's randomart image is:

```

Copy the generated public key file, `id_rsa.pub`, to the BART user account, `enterprisedb`, on the BART host, `192.168.2.22`:

```text
-bash-4.1$ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub enterprisedb@192.168.2.22:/tmp/tmp.pub
The authenticity of host '192.168.2.22 (192.168.2.22)' can't be

```

Log into the BART host as the BART user account and append the temporary public key file, `/tmp/tmp.pub` onto the `authorized_keys` file owned by the BART user account.

```text
-bash-4.1$ ssh enterprisedb@192.168.2.22
enterprisedb@192.168.2.22's password:
Last login: Tue Apr 21 17:03:24 2015 from 192.168.2.22

-rw-r--r-- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 416 Apr 23 13:04 id_rsa.pub
```

The `authorized_keys` file must have file permission `600` as set by the following `chmod 600` command, otherwise the passwordless connection fails:

```text
-bash-4.1$ chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
-bash-4.1$ ls -l .ssh

-rw-r--r-- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 416 Apr 23 13:04 id_rsa.pub
-bash-4.1$ rm /tmp/tmp.pub
-bash-4.1$ exit
logout
Connection to 192.168.2.22 closed.
```

Test the passwordless connection. From the remote host, verify that you can log into the BART host with the BART user account without being prompted for a password:

```text
-bash-4.1$ ssh enterprisedb@192.168.2.22
Last login: Thu Apr 23 13:14:48 2015 from 192.168.2.24
-bash-4.1$ exit
logout
Connection to 192.168.2.22 closed.
```

### Configuring Access from the BART Host to a Remote Advanced Server

On the BART host `192.168.2.22`, copy the public key file for the BART user account, `enterprisedb`, for access to the remote database server user account, `enterprisedb`, on the remote host `192.168.2.24`.

The following lists the current SSH keys files in the BART user’s `.ssh` directory on the BART host:

```text
[user@localhost ~]$ su - enterprisedb
Password:
-bash-4.1$ pwd
/opt/PostgresPlus/9.6AS
-bash-4.1$ ls -l .ssh

-rw-r--r-- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 416 Apr 23 13:04 id_rsa.pub
```

The public key file, `id_rsa.pub`, for BART user account `enterprisedb` on the BART host that was earlier generated in [Generating a Public Key File for the BART User Account](#generating-a-public-key-file-for-the-bart-user-account), is now copied to the remote Advanced Server host on `192.168.2.24`:

```text
-bash-4.1$ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub enterprisedb@192.168.2.24:/tmp/tmp.pub
The authenticity of host '192.168.2.24 (192.168.2.24)' can't be

```

### Configuring Access from a Remote PostgreSQL Server to a BART Host

On the remote host (192.168.2.24), create a public key file owned by the database server user account (`postgres`), allowing access to the BART user account (`enterprisedb`) on the BART host (192.168.2.22).

Create the `.ssh` directory for the `postgres` user account on the remote host:

```text
[root@localhost 9.6]# cd /opt/PostgreSQL/9.6
[root@localhost 9.6]# mkdir .ssh
[root@localhost 9.6]# chown postgres .ssh
[root@localhost 9.6]# chgrp postgres .ssh
[root@localhost 9.6]# chmod 700 .ssh
[root@localhost 9.6]# ls -la | grep ssh
drwx------ 2 postgres postgres 4096 Apr 23 13:32 .ssh
```

Create and copy the generated public key file, `id_rsa.pub`, to the BART user account (`enterprisedb`), on the BART host (`192.168.2.22`):

### Configuring Access from the BART Host to Remote PostgreSQL

Copy the public key file on the BART host that is owned by the BART user account (`enterprisedb`) to the remote database server user account (`postgres`), on the remote host (192.168.2.24).

The following lists the current SSH keys files in the BART user’s `.ssh` directory on the BART host:

```text
[user@localhost ~]$ su - enterprisedb
Password:
-bash-4.1$ ls -l .ssh
total 16
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 828 Apr 23 13:40 authorized_keys
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 1675 Apr 23 13:04 id_rsa
-rw-r--r-- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 416 Apr 23 13:04 id_rsa.pub
-rw-r--r-- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 394 Apr 23 13:24 known_hosts
```

The public key file, `id_rsa.pub`, for BART user account `enterprisedb` on the BART host that was earlier generated in [Generating a Public Key File for the BART User Account](#generating-a-public-key-file-for-the-bart-user-account), now resides on the remote PostgreSQL host:

```text
-bash-4.1$ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub postgres@192.168.2.24:/tmp/tmp.pub
postgres@192.168.2.24's password:
id_rsa.pub
```

Log into the `postgres` user account on the remote host and copy the public key file onto the `authorized_keys` file of `postgres` under its `.ssh` directory:

```text
-bash-4.1$ ssh postgres@192.168.2.24
postgres@192.168.2.24's password:
Last login: Mon Jan 26 18:08:36 2015 from 192.168.2.19
-bash-4.1$ pwd
/opt/PostgreSQL/9.6
-bash-4.1$ cat /tmp/tmp.pub >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```

Adjust the file permissions on `authorized_keys`:

```text
-bash-4.1$ ls -l .ssh

## Configuring a Replication Database User

This section demonstrates how a replication database user is established.

**All database servers must use a superuser as the replication database user.**

The replication database user for each database server is specified by the `user` parameter in the BART configuration file as shown by the following:

```text
[ACCTG]

host = 127.0.0.1
port = 5444
user = enterprisedb <=== Replication Database User
cluster_owner = enterprisedb
backup_name = acctg_%year-%month-%dayT%hour:%minute
archive_command = 'cp %p %a/%f'
description = "Accounting"

[MKTG]
host = 192.168.2.24
port = 5444
user = repuser <=== Replication Database User
cluster_owner = enterprisedb
backup_name = mktg_%year-%month-%dayT%hour:%minute
remote_host = enterprisedb@192.168.2.24
description = "Marketing"

[HR]

host = 192.168.2.24
port = 5432
user = postgres <=== Replication Database User
cluster_owner = enterprisedb
backup_name = hr_%year-%month-%dayT%hour:%minute
remote_host = postgres@192.168.2.24
copy_wals_during_restore = enabled
description = "Human Resources"
```

Add entries to the `.pgpass` file on each server to allow the BART user account to initiate a backup without being prompted for credentials. The `.pgpass` file is located in `/opt/PostgresPlus/9.6AS/.pgpass`:

```text
127.0.0.1:5444:*:enterprisedb:password
192.168.2.24:5444:*:repuser:password
192.168.2.24:5432:*:postgres:password
```

For more information about using a `.pgpass` file, please see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html).

While connected to `MKTG` on 192.168.2.24, execute the following `CREATE ROLE` command to create the replication database superuser:

```text
CREATE ROLE repuser WITH LOGIN SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'password';
```

Access is granted in the `pg_hba.conf` file for the local Advanced Server:

```text
# TYPE     DATABASE            USER        ADDRESS         METHOD
# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local        all                all                          md5
# IPv4     local connections:

# replication privilege.
#local     replication       enterprisedb                    md5
host       replication       enterprisedb  127.0.0.1/32      md5
```

Similarly, access is granted in the `pg_hba.conf` file for the remote Advanced Server installation:

```text
# TYPE    DATABASE           USER        ADDRESS             METHOD
# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local      all               all                               md5
# IPv4 local connections:
host       template1         repuser      192.168.2.22/32      md5
host       all               enterprisedb 127.0.0.1/32         md5
#host      all               all          127.0.0.1/32         md5
# IPv6 local connections:
host       all               all           ::1/128             md5
# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
# replication privilege.
#local   replication         enterprisedb                      md5
host     replication         repuser       192.168.2.22/32     md5
```

Access is also granted in the `pg_hba.conf` file for the remote PostgreSQL server:

```text
# TYPE    DATABASE           USER        ADDRESS               METHOD

```

<div id="wal_archiving_configuration_parameters" class="registered_link"></div>

## WAL Archiving Configuration Parameters

Use the following parameters in the `postgresql.conf` file to enable WAL archiving. The `postgresql.conf` file for the local Advanced Server database (`ACCTG`) is set as follows:

```text
wal_level = archive
archive_mode = on                              # allows archiving to be done
                                               # (change requires restart)
#archive_command = ''                          # command to use to archive
                                                 a logfile segment
                                               # placeholders: %p = path of
                                                file to archive
                                               # %f = file name only
max_wal_senders = 3
```

When the `INIT` subcommand is invoked, the Postgres `archive_command` configuration parameter in the `postgresql.auto.conf` file will be set based on the BART `archive_command` parameter located in the BART configuration file.

!!! Note
    If the Postgres `archive_command` is already set, invoke the `INIT` subcommand with the `-- no-configure` option to prevent the `archive_command` from being reset. For details, see [INIT](../bart_user/03_using_bart/03_basic_bart_subcommand_usage/02_init/#init).

```text
[BART]
bart_host= enterprisedb@192.168.2.22
backup_path = /opt/backup
pg_basebackup_path = /usr/edb/as11/bin/pg_basebackup
retention_policy = 6 BACKUPS
logfile = /tmp/bart.log
scanner_logfile = /tmp/bart_scanner.log

[ACCTG]
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 5444
user = enterprisedb
cluster_owner = enterprisedb
backup_name = acctg_%year-%month-%dayT%hour:%minute
archive_command = 'cp %p %a/%f'
description = "Accounting"
```

When the `INIT` subcommand is invoked, the `postgresql.auto.conf` file contains the following:

```text
# Do not edit this file manually!
# It will be overwritten by ALTER SYSTEM command.
archive_command = 'cp %p /opt/backup/acctg/archived_wals/%f'
```

The `archive_command` uses the `cp` command instead of `scp` since the BART backup catalog is local to this database cluster and the BART user account (the account that owns the backup catalog, `enterprisedb`), is the same user account running Advanced Server. The result is that there is no directory permission conflict during the archive operation.

The `postgresql.conf` file for the remote Advanced Server, `MKTG` is set as follows:

```text
wal_level = archive
archive_mode = on                              # allows archiving to be done
                                               # (change requires restart)
archive_command = ''                           # command to use to archive a
                                                 logfile segment
                                               # placeholders: %p = path of
                                               file to archive
                                               # %f = file name only
max_wal_senders = 3
```

When the `INIT` subcommand is invoked, the Postgres `archive_command` configuration parameter in the `postgresql.auto.conf` file will be set by the default BART format of the BART `archive_command` parameter (since it is not explicitly set for this database server in the BART configuration file).

```text
[BART]
bart_host= enterprisedb@192.168.2.22
backup_path = /opt/backup
pg_basebackup_path = /usr/edb/as11/bin/pg_basebackup
retention_policy = 6 BACKUPS
logfile = /tmp/bart.log
scanner_logfile = /tmp/bart_scanner.log

[MKTG]

host = 192.168.2.24
port = 5444
user = repuser
cluster_owner = enterprisedb
backup_name = mktg_%year-%month-%dayT%hour:%minute
remote_host = enterprisedb@192.168.2.24
description = "Marketing"
```

The default BART `archive_command` format is:

```text
archive_command = 'scp %p %h:%a/%f'
```

The `postgresql.auto.conf` file contains the following after the `INIT` subcommand is invoked:

```text
# Do not edit this file manually!
# It will be overwritten by ALTER SYSTEM command.
archive_command = 'scp %p
enterprisedb@192.168.2.22:/opt/backup/hr/archived_wals/%f'
```

The `archive_command` uses the `scp` command since the BART backup catalog is remote relative to this database cluster. The BART user account, `enterprisedb`, is specified on the `scp` command since this is the user account owning the BART backup catalog where the archived WAL files are to be copied. The result is that there is no directory permission conflict during the archive operation.

The `postgresql.conf` file for the remote PostgreSQL server (`HR`) is set as follows:

```text
wal_level = archive
archive_mode = on                              # allows archiving to be done
                                               # (change requires restart)
#archive_command = ''                          # command to use to archive a
                                                 logfile segment
                                               # placeholders: %p = path of
                                                 file to archive
                                               # %f = file name only
max_wal_senders = 3
```

When the `INIT` subcommand is invoked, the Postgres `archive_command` configuration parameter in the `postgresql.auto.conf` file will be set by the default BART format of the BART `archive_command` parameter (since it is not explicitly set for this database server in the BART configuration file):

```text

backup_name = hr_%year-%month-%dayT%hour:%minute
remote_host = postgres@192.168.2.24
copy_wals_during_restore = enabled
description = "Human Resources"
```

The default BART `archive_command` format is:

```text
archive_command = 'scp %p %h:%a/%f'
```

The `postgresql.auto.conf` file contains the following after the `INIT` subcommand is invoked:

```text
# Do not edit this file manually!
# It will be overwritten by ALTER SYSTEM command.
archive_command = 'scp %p
enterprisedb@192.168.2.22:/opt/backup/hr/archived_wals/%f'
```

The `archive_command` uses the `scp` command since the BART backup catalog is remote relative to this database cluster. The BART user account, `enterprisedb`, is specified on the `scp` command since this is the user account owning the BART backup catalog where the archived WAL files are to be copied. The result is that there is no directory permission conflict during the archive operation.

<div id="creating_the_bart_backup_catalog_backup_path" class="registered_link"></div>

## Creating the BART Backup Catalog (backup_path)

Create the directory specified by the `backup_path` configuration parameter.

```text
[BART]

bart_host= enterprisedb@192.168.2.22
backup_path = /opt/backup
pg_basebackup_path = /usr/edb/as11/bin/pg_basebackup
retention_policy = 6 BACKUPS
logfile = /tmp/bart.log
scanner_logfile = /tmp/bart_scanner.log
```

Ensure that the directory is owned by the BART user account:

```text
[root@localhost opt]# pwd
/opt
[root@localhost opt]# mkdir backup
[root@localhost opt]# chown enterprisedb backup
[root@localhost opt]# chgrp enterprisedb backup
[root@localhost opt]# chmod 700 backup
[root@localhost opt]# ls -l | grep backup
drwx------ 2 enterprisedb enterprisedb 4096 Apr 23 15:36 backup
```

Use the BART `INIT` subcommand to complete the directory structure and set the Postgres `archive_command` configuration parameter.

Before invoking any BART subcommands, set up a profile under the BART user account’s home directory to set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `PATH` environment variables. For more information regarding setting this variable, see the EDB Backup and Recovery Installation and Upgrade Guide available at the [EDB website](/bart/latest/bart_inst/).

The `-o` option is specified with the `INIT` subcommand to force the setting of the Postgres `archive_command` configuration parameter when `archive_mode` is `off` or if the Postgres `archive_command` parameter is already set and needs to be overridden.

```text
[user@localhost ~]$ su - enterprisedb
Password:
-bash-4.1$ bart INIT -o

The `ARCHIVE PATH` field displays the full directory path to where the WAL files are copied. This directory path must match the directory path specified in the Postgres `archive_command` parameter of the `postgresql.conf` file or the `postgresql.auto.conf` file of each database server.

<div id="starting_the_database_servers_with_wal_archiving" class="registered_link"></div>

### Starting the Database Servers with WAL Archiving

After the BART backup catalog directory structure has been configured, start the archiving of WAL files from the database servers by restarting each database server.

On BART host 192.168.2.22:

```text
[root@localhost data]# service ppas-9.6 restart
```

On remote host 192.168.2.24:

```text
[root@localhost data]# service ppas-9.6 restart

[root@localhost data]# service postgresql-9.6 restart
```

In the BART backup catalog, verify that the WAL files are archiving.

Archived WAL files may not appear very frequently depending upon how often WAL archiving is set to switch to a new segment file with the `archive_timeout` parameter in your database server configuration settings.

Verify that there are no archiving-related errors in the database server log files.

## Taking a Full Backup

## Using Point-In-Time Recovery

This section demonstrates using the point-in-time recovery operation on the remote PostgreSQL database server.

The following tables were created about two minutes apart with WAL archiving enabled:

```text
postgres=# \dt

             List of relations
Schema  |      Name      |  Type   | Owner

--------+----------------+---------+---------
public  | hr_rmt_t1_1356 | table   | postgres
public  | hr_rmt_t1_1358 | table   | postgres
public  | hr_rmt_t1_1400 | table   | postgres
public  | hr_rmt_t1_1402 | table   | postgres
public  | hr_rmt_t1_1404 | table   | postgres
public  | hr_rmt_t1_1406 | table   | postgres
(6 rows)
```

In the table name `hr_rmt_t<n>_<hhmi>, n` represents the active timeline. `<hhmi>` is the approximate time the table was created. For example, `hr_rmt_t1_1356` was created at approximately 1:56 PM while timeline #1 is active.

The PostgreSQL database server was then stopped. WAL files that have been created, but not yet archived must be identified, and then saved. The following archived WAL files are in the BART backup catalog:

```text
-bash-4.1$ ls -l hr/archived_wals
total 49156
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 16777216 Mar 29 13:50
000000010000000000000001
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 16777216 Mar 29 13:50
000000010000000000000002
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 302 Mar 29 13:50
000000010000000000000002.00000028.backup
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 16777216 Mar 29 14:07
000000010000000000000003
```

The following sample lists the current PostgreSQL server WAL files. The unarchived WAL files are marked with two stars (\*\*).

```text
-bash-4.1$ cd /opt/PostgreSQL/9.6/data/pg_xlog
-bash-4.1$ pwd
/opt/PostgreSQL/9.6/data/pg_xlog
-bash-4.1$ ls -l
total 49160
-rw------- 1 postgres postgres 302 Mar 29 13:50
000000010000000000000002.00000028.backup
-rw------- 1 postgres postgres 16777216 Mar 29 14:07
000000010000000000000003
-rw------- 1 postgres postgres 16777216 Mar 29 14:07

**000000010000000000000005**
drwx------ 2 postgres postgres 4096 Mar 29 14:07 archive_status
```

Copies of the unarchived WAL files are saved to a temporary location:

```text
-bash-4.1$ mkdir /tmp/unarchived_pg96_wals
-bash-4.1$ pwd
/opt/PostgreSQL/9.6/data/pg_xlog
bash-4.1$ cp -p 000000010000000000000004 /tmp/unarchived_pg96_wals
bash-4.1$ cp -p 000000010000000000000005 /tmp/unarchived_pg96_wals
bash-4.1$ ls -l /tmp/unarchived_pg96_wals
total 32768
-rw------- 1 postgres postgres 16777216 Mar 29 14:07 000000010000000000000004
-rw------- 1 postgres postgres 16777216 Mar 29 13:50 000000010000000000000005
```

On the remote host, a directory is created to which the PostgreSQL database cluster is to be restored. This restore path is named `/opt/restore_pg96` and is owned by user account `postgres`.

```text
[user@localhost ~]$ su root
Password:
[root@localhost user]# cd /opt
[root@localhost opt]# mkdir restore_pg96
[root@localhost opt]# chown postgres restore_pg96
[root@localhost opt]# chgrp postgres restore_pg96
[root@localhost opt]# chmod 700 restore_pg96
[root@localhost opt]# ls -l
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 4 root daemon 4096 Mar 29 12:10 PostgresPlus

drwx------ 2 postgres postgres 4096 Mar 29 14:15 restore_pg96
drwxr-xr-x. 2 root root 4096 Nov 22 2013 rh
```

In the BART configuration file, the remote user and remote host IP address, `postgres@192.168.2.24`, have been set with the `remote_host` parameter. If not given in the BART configuration file, this information must then be specified by the `--remote-host` option when giving the `RESTORE` subcommand (for example, `bart RESTORE --remote-host postgres@192.168.2.24 …`).

```text
[HR]

host = 192.168.2.24
port = 5432
user = postgres
cluster_owner = postgres
backup_name = hr_%year-%month-%dayT%hour:%minute
remote_host = postgres@192.168.2.24
copy_wals_during_restore = enabled
description = "Human Resources"
```

Use the `SHOW-BACKUPS` subcommand to identify the backup to use with the `RESTORE` subcommand.

```text

```

The `-t` option with the `SHOW-BACKUPS` subcommand displays additional backup information:

```text
-bash-4.1$ bart SHOW-BACKUPS -s hr -i 1490809824946 -t
SERVER NAME    : hr

```

A recovery is made using timeline `1` to `2017-03-29 14:01:00`.

```text
-bash-4.1$ bart RESTORE -s hr -i hr_2017-03-29T13:50 -p

Copy the saved, unarchived WAL files to the restore path `pg_xlog` subdirectory (`/opt/restore_pg96/pg_xlog`):

```text
-bash-4.1$ pwd
/opt/restore_pg96/pg_xlog
-bash-4.1$ ls -l

000000010000000000000005
drwx------ 2 postgres postgres 4096 Mar 29 14:27 archive_status
```

Inspect the `/opt/restore_pg96/postgresql.auto.conf` file to verify that it contains the correct recovery settings:

```text
restore_command = 'cp archived_wals/%f %p'
recovery_target_time = '2017-03-29 14:01:00'
recovery_target_timeline = 1
```

Note that the command restores from the `archived_wals` subdirectory of `/opt/restore_pg96` since the `copy_wals_during_restore` parameter in the BART configuration file is set to `enabled` for database server `hr`.

Start the database server to initiate the point-in-time recovery operation:

```text
[user@localhost ~]$ su postgres
Password:
bash-4.1$ cd /opt/restore_pg96
bash-4.1$ /opt/PostgreSQL/9.6/bin/pg_ctl start -D /opt/restore_pg96 -l
/opt/restore_pg96/pg_log/logfile
server starting
```

Inspect the database server log file to ensure the operation did not result in any errors:

```text

The tables that exist in the recovered database cluster are:

```text
postgres=# \dt
          List of relations
Schema  | Name           | Type  | Owner
--------+----------------+-------+----------
public  | hr_rmt_t1_1356 | table | postgres
public  | hr_rmt_t1_1358 | table | postgres
public  | hr_rmt_t1_1400 | table | postgres
(3 rows)
```

Since recovery was up to and including 2017-03-29 14:01:00, the following tables created after 14:01 are not present:

```text
public  | hr_rmt_t1_1402  | table  | postgres
public  | hr_rmt_t1_1404  | table  | postgres
public  | hr_rmt_t1_1406  | table  | postgres
```

The BART `RESTORE` operation stops WAL archiving by adding an `archive_mode = off` parameter at the very end of the `postgresql.conf` file. This last parameter in the file overrides any other previous setting of the same parameter in the file. Delete the last setting and restart the database server to start WAL archiving.

```text
# Add settings for extensions here
archive_mode = off
```
