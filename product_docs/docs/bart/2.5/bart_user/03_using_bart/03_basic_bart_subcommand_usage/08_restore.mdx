The `RESTORE` subcommand restores a backup and its archived WAL files for the designated database server to the specified directory location. If the appropriate `RESTORE` options are specified, all recovery settings will be saved in the `postgresql.auto.conf` file.

**Syntax:**

```text
bart RESTORE –s <server_name> -p <restore_path>
  [ –i { <backup_id> | <backup_name> } ]
  [ -r <remote_user@remote_host_address> ]
  [ -w <number_of_workers> ]
  [ -t <timeline_id> ]
  [ { -x <target_xid> | -g <target_timestamp> } ]
  [ -c ]
```

For information about using a continuous archive backup for recovery, see the [PostgreSQL Core Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/static/continuous-archiving.html). This reference material provides detailed information about the underlying point-in-time recovery process and the meaning and usage of the restore options that are generated into the `postgresql.auto.conf` file by BART.

**Please note**:

-   For special requirements when restoring an incremental backup to a remote database server, see [Restoring an Incremental Backup on a Remote Host](../../02_overview/01_block-level_incremental_backup/05_restoring_an_incremental_backup/#restoring_an_incremental_backup_on_a_remote_host).
-   Check to ensure that the host where the backup is to be restored contains enough disk space for the backup and its archived WAL files. The `RESTORE` subcommand may result in an error while copying files if there is not enough disk space available.
-   See [Performing a Restore Operation](../01_bart_management_overview/01_performing_a_restore_operation/#performing_a_restore_operation) to view steps on how to perform a restore operation and see [Point-In-Time Recovery Operation](../01_bart_management_overview/02_point_in_time_recovery_operation/#point_in_time_recovery_operation) to view steps on how to perform a point-in-time recovery operation.
-   If the backup is restored to a different database cluster directory than where the original database cluster resided, certain operations dependent upon the database cluster location may fail. This happens if their supporting service scripts are not updated to reflect the new directory location of restored backup. For information about the usage and modification of service scripts, see the *EDB Advanced Server Installation Guide* available at the [EDB website](/epas/latest/).

The following table describes the command options:

The output of each streamer process is connected to the input of a receiver process.

| `-g <target_timestamp>`<br /><br />`--target-timestamp <target_timestamp>`                 | `<target_timestamp>` is the timestamp that determines the point in time up to and including, which point-in-time recovery encompasses. Include either the `--target-timestamp <target_timestamp>` or the `-g <target_timestamp>` option if point-in-time recovery is desired.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

See the *EDB Backup and Recovery Installation and Upgrade Guide* available at the [EDB website](/bart/latest/bart_inst/) for information about the `copy_wals_during_restore` parameter.                                                                                                         |
