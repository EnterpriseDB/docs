When a backup is initially created with the `BACKUP` subcommand, it is always recorded with active status. Use the `MANAGE` subcommand to evaluate if the backup status should be changed to obsolete in accordance with the retention policy. You can review the current status of your backups with the `SHOW-BACKUPS` subcommand.

Active backups are evaluated and also marked (that is, internally recorded by BART) as obsolete only when the `MANAGE` subcommand is invoked either with no options or with only the `-s` option.

Once a backup has been marked as obsolete, you cannot change it back to active unless you perform the following steps:

-   Use the `MANAGE` subcommand with the `-c` option along with the backup identifier or name with the `-i` option. To keep this particular backup indefinitely, use `-c keep`, otherwise use `-c nokeep`.
-   If you use the `-c nokeep` option, the backup status is changed back to active. When the `MANAGE` subcommand is used the next time, the backup is re-evaluated to determine if its status needs to be changed back to obsolete based on the current retention policy in the BART configuration file.

After setting the `retention_policy` parameter and running the `MANAGE` subcommand if you change the `retention_policy` parameter, the current, marked status of the backups are probably inconsistent with the new `retention_policy` setting. To modify the backup status to be consistent with the new `retention_policy` setting, you need to run the `MANAGE` subcommand with:

-   the `-c nokeep` option to change the obsolete status to active status if there are backups currently marked as obsolete that would no longer be considered obsolete under a new retention policy. You can also specify the `-i all` option to change all backups back to active status, including those currently marked as keep.
-   no options or with only the `-s` option to reset the marked status based on the new `retention_policy` setting in the BART configuration file.

See [MANAGE](../03_basic_bart_subcommand_usage/07_manage/#manage) for usage information for the `MANAGE` subcommand.
