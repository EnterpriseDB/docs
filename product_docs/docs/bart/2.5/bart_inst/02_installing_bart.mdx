## Installing BART on a CentOS Host

The following section demonstrates installing BART on a CentOS host using an RPM package.  This section assumes that the user has some knowledge of installation and system administration procedures, and has administrative privileges on the host.

1.  To install the repository configuration, assume superuser privileges and invoke one of the following platform-specific commands:

    On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

    On CentOS 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

2.  Replace the `USERNAME:PASSWORD` in the following command with the username and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user:

    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

    To request credentials for the repository, visit the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user).

3.  Before installing BART, execute the following command to install the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) release package:

    On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

    On CentOS 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install epel-release
    ```

4.  For CentOS 8, enable the PowerTools repository to satisfy EPEL package dependencies:

    ```text
    dnf config-manager --set-enabled PowerTools
    ```

5.  For CentOS 8, disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:

    ```text
    dnf -qy module disable postgresql
    ```

6.  Optionally, install the `pg_basebackup` utility program using the server client package. If you do not already have the `pg_basebackup` program installed on the BART host, you can install a limited number of files that include the `pg_basebackup` program by invoking the following command:

    On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum install edb-as<xx>-server-client
    ```

    On CentOS 8:

    ```text
    dnf install edb-as<xx>-server-client
    ```

    In the above command, replace `<xx>` with the required Advanced Server version. The `pg_basebackup` version must be the same or more recent than the database server to be backed up. For example, `pg_basebackup` version 10 can be used to back up database server version 10, but cannot be used to back up database server version 11.

7.  Use the following command to install BART:

    On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-bart-2.5.9
    ```

    On CentOS 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install edb-bart-2.5.9
    ```

    Repeat the installation process described in this section to install BART on each remote host on which an incremental backup is to be restored.

    To verify the BART installation, navigate to the `/usr/edb/bart/bin` directory and execute the following command:

    ```text
    bart --version
    ```

    The `bart --version` command should return the current BART version. If the `bart --version` command returns an error stating the PATH is not available after switching from the root user to another BART user account, adjust the setting of the `PATH` environment variable to include the directory location of the BART `bin` subdirectory in the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` files of the following user accounts:

    -   The BART user account on the BART host. See [Configuring BART](03_configuring_bart/#path) for details.
    -   The remote user account on the remote host to which incremental backups are to be restored. For details, see the *EDB Backup and Recovery User Guide* available at the [EDB website](/bart/latest/bart_user/).

    Upon successful installation, BART is installed in the `BART_HOME` directory:

    `/usr/edb/bart`

    The installation includes the following files:

| File Name           | Location          | Description                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| bart                | `<BART_HOME>`/bin | BART command line, executable program |
| bart-scanner        | `<BART_HOME>`/bin | BART WAL scanner program              |
| bart.cfg.sample     | `<BART_HOME>`/etc | Sample BART configuration file        |
| xlogreader_ident.so | `<BART_HOME>`/lib | Libraries supporting WAL versions     |
| bart_license.txt    | `<BART_HOME>`     | License agreement                     |

After BART is installed successfully, you need to [configure the installation](03_configuring_bart/#configuration).

## Installing BART on a RHEL Host

The following section demonstrates installing BART on a RHEL host using an RPM package.  This section assumes that the user has some knowledge of installation and system administration procedures, and has administrative privileges on the host.

1.  To install the repository configuration, assume superuser privileges and invoke one of the following platform-specific commands:

    On RHEL 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

    On RHEL 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

2.  Replace the `USERNAME:PASSWORD` in the following command with the username and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user:

    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

    To request credentials for the repository, visit the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user).

3.  Before installing BART, execute the following command to install the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) release package:

    On RHEL 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

    On RHEL 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
    ```

4.  Enable the repository:

    On RHEL 7, enable the `optional, extras`, and `HA` repositories to satisfy EPEL package dependencies:

    ```text
    subscription-manager repos --enable "rhel-*-optional-rpms" --enable "rhel-*-extras-rpms"  --enable "rhel-ha-for-rhel-*-server-rpms"
    ```

    On RHEL 8, enable the `codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-*-rpms` repository to satisfy EPEL packages dependency:

    ```text
    ARCH=$( /bin/arch )

    subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"
    ```

5.  For RHEL 8, disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:

    ```text
    dnf -qy module disable postgresql
    ```

6.  Optionally, install the `pg_basebackup` utility program using the server client package. If you do not already have the `pg_basebackup` program installed on the BART host, you can install a limited number of files that include the `pg_basebackup` program by invoking the following command:

    On RHEL 7:

    ```text
    yum install edb-as<xx>-server-client
    ```

    On RHEL 8:

    ```text
    dnf install edb-as<xx>-server-client
    ```

    In the above command, replace `<xx>` with the required Advanced Server version. The `pg_basebackup` version must be the same or more recent than the database server to be backed up. For example, `pg_basebackup` version 10 can be used to back up database server version 10, but cannot be used to back up database server version 11.

7.  Use the following command to install the BART:

    On RHEL 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-bart-2.5.9
    ```

    On RHEL 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install edb-bart-2.5.9
    ```

    Repeat the installation process described in this section to install BART on each remote host on which an incremental backup is to be restored.

    To verify the BART installation, navigate to the `/usr/edb/bart/bin` directory and execute the following command:

    ```text
    bart --version
    ```

    The `bart --version` command should return the current BART version. If the `bart --version` command returns an error stating the PATH is not available after switching from the root user to another BART user account, adjust the setting of the `PATH` environment variable to include the directory location of the BART `bin` subdirectory in the `~/.bashrc` or `~/.bash_profile` files of the following user accounts:

    -   The BART user account on the BART host. See [Configuring BART](03_configuring_bart/#path) for details.
    -   The remote user account on the remote host to which incremental backups are to be restored. For details, see the *EDB Backup and Recovery User Guide* available at the [EDB website](/bart/latest/bart_user/).

    Upon successful installation, BART is installed in the `BART_HOME` directory:

    `/usr/edb/bart`

    The installation includes the following files:

| File Name           | Location          | Description                           |
| ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| bart                | `<BART_HOME>`/bin | BART command line, executable program |
| bart-scanner        | `<BART_HOME>`/bin | BART WAL scanner program              |
| bart.cfg.sample     | `<BART_HOME>`/etc | Sample BART configuration file        |
| xlogreader_ident.so | `<BART_HOME>`/lib | Libraries supporting WAL versions     |
| bart_license.txt    | `<BART_HOME>`     | License agreement                     |

After BART is installed successfully, you need to [configure the installation](03_configuring_bart/#configuration).
