This section walks you through uninstalling BART.

## Uninstalling BART on a RHEL/CentOS Host

To uninstall BART on a RHEL/CentOS host, assume the identity of the `root` user and invoke the following command:

On RHEL/CentOS 7:

```text
yum remove edb-bart
```

On RHEL/CentOS 8:

```text
dnf remove edb-bart
```

Uninstalling BART does not delete the backup files and archived WAL files that reside in the BART backup catalog. To permanently delete the backup files and archived WAL files in the BART backup catalog (`/opt/backup`), use one of the following commands:

-   `rm â€“rf /opt/backup`
-   BART `DELETE` subcommand

For information about the BART `DELETE` subcommand, see the *EDB Backup and Recovery User Guide* available at the [EDB website](/bart/latest/bart_user/).
