The `MANAGE` subcommand can be invoked to:

-   Evaluate backups, mark their status, and delete obsolete backups based on the `retention_policy` parameter in the BART configuration file.
-   Compress the archived WAL files based on the `wal_compression` parameter in the BART configuration file.

**Syntax:**

```text
bart MANAGE [ â€“s { <server_name> | all} ]
[ -l ] [ -d ]
[ -c { keep | nokeep }
-i { <backup_id> | <backup_name> | all } ]
[ -n ]
```

To view detailed information about the `MANAGE` subcommand and retention policy management, see *the EDB Backup and Recovery User Guide*. For information about setting the `wal_compression` parameter, see the *EDB Backup and Recovery Installation and Upgrade Guide*. These guides are available at the [EDB website](/bart/latest/bart_user/).

The following table describes the `MANAGE` options:
