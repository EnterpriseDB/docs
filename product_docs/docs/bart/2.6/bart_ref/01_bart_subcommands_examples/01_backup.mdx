Use the `BACKUP` subcommand to create a full or incremental backup.

**Syntax for a Full Backup:**

```text
bart BACKUP –s { <server_name> | all } [ -F { p | t } ]

[ -z ] [ –c <compression_level> ]

[ --backup-name <backup_name> ]

[ --thread-count <number_of_threads> ]

[ { --with-pg_basebackup | --no-pg_basebackup } ]
```

**Syntax for an Incremental Backup:**

```text
bart BACKUP –s <server_name> [-Fp]

[ --parent { <backup_id> | <backup_name> } ]

[ --backup-name <backup_name> ]

[ --thread-count <number_of_threads> ]

[ { --checksum-algorithm } ]
```

Before performing an incremental backup, you must take a full backup. For more details about incremental backup, refer to *Block-Level Incremental Backup* in the *EDB Backup and Recovery User Guide* available at the [EDB website](/bart/latest/bart_user/).

The following table describes the `BACKUP` options:

| Options                                                                | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

| `-s { <server_name> \| all }`<br />`--server { <server_name> \| all }` | Use this option to specify the database server to be backed up.<br />Specify `<server_name>` to take a backup of the database server (as specified in the BART configuration file).<br />Specify `all` to take a backup of all servers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `-F { p \| t }`<br />`--format { p \| t }`                             | Use this option to specify the backup file format.<br />Specify `p` option to take backup in plain text format and specify `t` option to take backup in tar format. If the `p` or `t` option is omitted, the default is tar format.<br />Use `p` option with the `BACKUP` subcommand when streaming is used as a backup method.<br />An incremental backup can only be taken in plain text format (`p`).                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `-z`<br />`(--gzip)`                                                   | This option is applicable only for full backup and `tar` format. Use this option to enable gzip compression of tar files using the default compression level (typically 6).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `-c <compression_level>`<br />`--compress-level <compression_level>`   | This is applicable only for full backup and tar format. Use this option to specify the gzip compression level on the tar file output. `<compression_level>` is a digit from 1 through 9, with 9 being the best compression.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `--backup-name <backup_name>`                                          | Use this option to assign a user-defined, alphanumeric friendly name to the backup. The maximum permitted length of backup name is 49 characters.<br />For detailed information about this parameter, see the EDB Backup and Recovery User Guide available at the [EDB website](/bart/latest/bart_user/).<br />If the option `--backup-name` is not specified and the `backup_name` parameter is not set for this database server in the BART configuration file, then the backup can only be referenced in other BART subcommands by the BART assigned backup identifier. |
| `--thread-count <number_of_threads>`                                   | Use this option to specify the number of worker threads to run in parallel to copy blocks for a backup.<br />For detailed information about the `--thread-count` parameter, see the EDB Backup and Recovery Installation and Upgrade Guide available at the [EDB website](/bart/latest/bart_inst/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `--with-pg_basebackup`                                                 | This is applicable only for full backup. Use this option to specify the use of `pg_basebackup` to take a full backup. The number of thread counts in effect is ignored as given by the `thread_count` parameter in the BART configuration file.<br />When taking a full backup, if the thread count in effect is greater than `1`, then the `pg_basebackup` utility is not used to take the full backup (parallel worker threads are used) unless the `--with-pg_basebackup` option is specified with the `BACKUP` subcommand.                                             |
| `--no-pg_basebackup`                                                   | This is applicable only for full backup. Use this option to specify that `pg_basebackup` is not to be used to take a full backup.<br />When taking a full backup, if the thread count in effect is only `1`, then the `pg_basebackup` utility is used to take the full backup unless the `--no-pg_basebackup` option is specified with the `BACKUP` subcommand.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `--parent { <backup_id> \| <backup_name> }`                            | Use this option to take an incremental backup. The parent backup is a backup taken prior to the incremental backup; it can be either a full backup or an incremental backup. `<backup_id>` is the backup identifier of a parent backup and `<backup_name>` is the user-defined alphanumeric name of a parent backup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Use this option to verify if the required MBM files are present in the BART backup catalog before taking an incremental backup. However, an actual incremental backup is not taken when the `--check` option is specified.<br />The `--parent` option must be used along with the `--check` option.                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `--checksum-algorithm`                                                 | While taking a backup, you can specify one of the following values with the `--checksum-algorithm` option:<br />`--checksum-algorithm=MD5` (default) to generate MD5 checksum files.<br />`--checksum-algorithm=SHA256` to generate SHA256 checksum files.<br />`--checksum-algorithm=NONE` to skip generating checksum files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

**Examples**

The following code sample demonstrates using variables with the `BACKUP` subcommand:

```text
./bart backup -s ppas12 -Ft --backup-name "YEAR = %year MONTH =
%month DAY = %day"
```

```text
./bart backup -s ppas12 -Ft --backup-name "YEAR = %year MONTH =
%month DAY = %day %%"
```

```text
./bart show-backups -s ppas12 -i "test backup"
```

The following code sample displays the result of creating a full backup in the default tar format with gzip compression when the `BACKUP` subcommand was invoked. Note that checksums are generated for the full backup and user-defined tablespaces for the tar format backup:

<div id="incremental_backup_using_checksum_algorithm" class="registered_link"></div>

The following code sample displays an incremental backup taken by specifying the `--checksum-algorithm=NONE` option to skip generating checksum files.

First, the bart-scanner is started.

```text
edb@localhost bin]$
[edb@localhost bin]$ ./bart-scanner -d --checksum-algorithm=NONE

INFO:  process created for server 'ppas11', pid = 19012
DEBUG: could not load XLogReaderLibrary at this time, archived_wals is empty
```

Then, an incremental backup is taken with the `--checksum-algorithm=NONE` option to skip generating checksum files.

!!! Note
    To restore an incremental backup taken with the `--checksum-algorithm=NONE` option, you must specify [--disable-checksum while restoring](06_restore/#restoring_an_incremental_backup_using_disable_checksum).

Similarly, you can specify `--checksum-algorithm=MD5` or `--checksum-algorithm=SHA256` while taking an incremental backup if you want to generate MD5 or SHAD256 checksum files.
