The `CHECK-CONFIG` subcommand checks the global parameter settings as well as the database server configuration in the BART configuration file.

The following syntax is used to check the BART configuration file global section settings.

```text
bart CHECK-CONFIG
```

The following syntax is used to check the database server configuration settings.

```text
bart CHECK-CONFIG [ –s <server_name> ]
```

The following table describes the `CHECK-CONFIG` option:

| Option                                      | Description                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-s <server_name>` `--server <server_name>` | `<server_name>` is the name of the database server whose configuration parameter settings are to be checked. |
