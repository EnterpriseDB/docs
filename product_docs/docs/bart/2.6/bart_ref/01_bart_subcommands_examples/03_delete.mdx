The `DELETE` subcommand removes the subdirectory and data files from the BART backup catalog for the specified backups along with archived WAL files.

**Syntax:**

```text
bart DELETE â€“s <server_name>
-i { all | [']{ <backup_id> | <backup_name> },... }['] }
[ -n ]
```

Note that when invoking the `DELETE` subcommand, you must specify a database server.

For database servers under a retention policy, there are conditions where certain backups may not be deleted. For more information, see the EDB Backup and Recovery User Guide available at the [EDB website](/bart/latest/bart_user/).

The following table describes the `DELETE` options:

**Example**

The following code sample demonstrates deleting a backup from the specified database server:

```text
[edb@localhost bin]$ ./bart DELETE -s acctg -i acctg_2019-08-27
INFO: deleting backup 'acctg_2019-08-27' of server 'acctg'
INFO: deleting backup '1566900093665'
INFO: WALs of deleted backup(s) will belong to prior backup(if any), or will
be marked unused
WARNING: not marking any WALs as unused WALs, the WAL file
'/home/edb/bkup_new/acctg/archived_wals/000000010000000000000025'
is required, yet not available in archived_wals directory
INFO: backup(s) deleted
[edb@localhost bin]$
```

After the deletion, the BART backup catalog for the database server no longer contains the corresponding directory for the deleted `backup ID`. The following code sample displays information about `archived_wals` subdirectory that no longer contains the backup WAL files:

```text
[edb@localhost acctg]$ ls -l
total 16
drwxrwxr-x. 3 edb edb 4096 Aug 27 06:03 1566900199604

drwxrwxr-x. 2 edb edb 6 Aug 27 06:01 archived_wals
```

The following code sample demonstrates deleting multiple backups from the database server.
