title: Executing the Migration

---

Execution of the migration can be very straight forward. The steps include:

1.  Adding extra storage capacity to the backup server:

    -   As a new mount point when migrating to a new mount point (or Cloud Storage endpoints).

    -   As extra storage on the existing mount point when reusing the same mount point.

2.  Installing the new tool on the backup server.

3.  Configuring the configuration file for the new tool. See  [How features are configured](#how-features-are-configured) for more information on changing a configuration file for one tool to another tool.

4.  Reconfiguring the scheduling. See [Scheduling](#scheduling) for more information on changing the scheduling from one tool to another tool.

5.  Checking the configuration:

    -   `barman check <example>`

    -   `pgbackrest --stanza=<example> --log-level-console=info check`

 Fix any issues.

6.  Running an initial backup manually, before relying on the scheduling
    (recommended). The check commands will recover the most common
    issues, but there could always still be unforeseen issues, like
    storage space issues, IO or network latency issues, etc. It would
    be unfortunate if the scheduled backups fail since that would
    increase risk for unsuccessful restores. As your team runs more
    migrations, they will gain more confidence to skip this step as
    required.

7.  Some organizations might prefer to actually restore and recover the
    backup (on a separate system), and check for the expected data.
    This is only an optional extra step, which greatly depends on your
    organization's policies.
