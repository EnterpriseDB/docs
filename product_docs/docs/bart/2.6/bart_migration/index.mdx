title: Moving to a New Backup Tool 
---
Barman and pgBackRest are now EDB's recommended backup and data recovery tools. If you are currently using BART as your backup and recovery tool, EDB recommends that you move to one of these tools. Typically Barman is the right choice unless you have performance requirements for backing up large, multi-terabyte databases. EDB continues to support BART at present, but wonâ€™t be adding any new features or enhancements.  EDB will announce when BART support ends with enough lead time for you to move off of BART as your backup tool. BART will not be supported for PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server versions v14 and above.

For more information about EDB's backup and recovery tool options see, the [Backup and Recovery](https://www.enterprisedb.com/products/postgresql-database-auto-backup-recovery-restore-script-tools) on the EDB web site.

This documentation describes how to choose which tool is right for your environment, how to migrate from BART to your tool of choice, and how to configure your tool of choice based on the configuration options you used in BART.

Which tool is the right tool for your environment very much depends on
your specific needs. Should you still have questions after reading this documentation, or require
