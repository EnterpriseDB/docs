title: Scheduling

---

Since BART, Barman, and pgBackRest all schedule the backups using cron,
changing the scheduling simply requires changing the scheduled commands.
Example commands for BART, Barman, and pgBackRest:

1.  Run a full backup for cluster \'example\':

    |   Tool     |   Command                                               |
    |------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
    | BART       | `bart BACKUP –s example`|
    | Barman     | `barman backup example`|
    | pgBackRest | `pgbackrest backup --type=full --stanza=example`|


 
2.  Run a full backup for all configured servers:

    |   Tool     |   Command                                               |
    |------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
    | BART       | `bart BACKUP –s all`|
    | Barman     | `barman backup all`|
    | pgBackRest | pgbackrest does not have an option to run for all stanzas with one command|

 

3.  Run an incremental backup:

    |   Tool     |   Command                                               |
    |------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
    | BART       | Retrieve the `backup_id`/`backup_name` for the parent (select a full for an incremental, select another inc/diff for a differential backup plan):<br/>`bart SHOW-BACKUPS example`<br/>Now supply the `backup_id`/`backup_name` as parent:<br/>`bart BACKUP –s example --parent { backup_id \| backup_name }`<br/>|
    | Barman     | `barman backup example --reuse-backup=link`<br/>This can also be set in the configuration file at the global/server level with `reuse_backup = link`|
    | pgBackRest | Incremental:`pgbackrest backup --type=incr --stanza=example`<br/>Differential: `pgbackrest backup --type=diff --stanza=example`|


### Retention management

-  With BART usually a cron job is set up to run maintenance on the
   BART repository (bart MANAGE). By supplying the -d option, the
   obsoleted backups are automatically cleaned (together with their
   WAL archives).

-  Similarly, Barman uses a cron command to run maintenance on the
   Barman repository \`barman cron\`. The \`barman cron\` command
   takes care of more things (like copying streamed WAL files to the
   WAL archive directory), and needs to be scheduled to run every
   minute. The Barman rpm or debian package automatically creates a
   cron entry running every minute as the barman user.

-  pgBackRest runs maintenance with the expire command (pgbackrest
   expire), but the expire command is run automatically after each
   successful backup, and is not required to be separately scheduled.

While migrating to a new tool, make sure that cron is reconfigured to
run the proper retention management commands.
