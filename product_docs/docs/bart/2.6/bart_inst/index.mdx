<div id="requirements_overview" class="registered_link"></div>

## Requirements Overview

### Supported Platforms and Database Versions

-   To view a complete list of supported platforms, visit the [EDB website.](https://www.enterprisedb.com/services-support/edb-supported-products-and-platforms)

    !!! Note
        BART 2.6 is no longer supported on CentOS/RHEL/OL 6.x platforms. It is strongly recommended that EDB products running on these platforms be migrated to a supported platform.

-   BART supports the following database versions:

    -   Advanced Server versions 9.6, 10, 11, 12, and 13.
    -   PostgreSQL versions 9.6, 10, 11, 12, and 13.

### Software Requirements

You require the following components to install BART.

-   BART Host Components - Use EDB packages to add BART host components; see [Installing BART](02_installing_bart/#installing-bart) for information about how to install these components.

-   Additional Components - In addition to the BART host components, the following components are required:

    -   The [Secure Shell (SSH) server daemon and Secure Copy (SCP) client programs](03_configuring_bart/#authorizing_ssh_scp_access) must be enabled and activated on the BART host as well as on the remote database server hosts on which BART will be managing backup and recovery.
    -   BART uses the `pg_basebackup` utility program when taking full backups.

### Limitation

BART supports taking only a full backup of standby servers; it does not support taking incremental or parallel backups of standby servers.
