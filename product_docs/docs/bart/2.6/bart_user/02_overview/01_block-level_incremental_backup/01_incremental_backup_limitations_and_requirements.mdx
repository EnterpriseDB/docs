The following limitations apply to incremental backup:

-   If you have restored a full or incremental backup, you must take a full backup before enabling incremental backup.
-   If a standby node has been promoted to the role of a primary node, you must take a full backup before enabling incremental backup on the cluster.
-   On a standby database server, you cannot take an incremental backup.

You must meet the following requirements before implementing incremental backup:

-   You must create or select an operating system account to be used as the BART user account.

-   You must create or select the replication database user, which must be a superuser.

-   In the BART configuration file:

    -   You must set the `cluster_owner` parameter to the Linux operating system user account that owns the database cluster directory from which incremental backups are to be taken.
    -   You must enable the `allow_incremental_backups` parameter.

-   A passwordless SSH/SCP connection must be established between the BART user account on the BART host and the `cluster_owner` user account on the database server.

    It must be noted that a passwordless SSH/SCP connection must be established even if BART and the database server are running on the same host and the BART user account and the `cluster_owner` user account are the same account.

-   In addition to the BART host (where the BART backup catalog resides), the BART package must also be installed on every remote database server on which incremental backups are to be restored. To restore an incremental backup, the `bart` program must be executable on the remote host by the remote user (the remote user is specified by the `remote_host` parameter in the BART configuration file or by the `-r` option when using the `RESTORE` subcommand to restore the incremental backup).

-   When [restoring incremental backups on a remote database server](05_restoring_an_incremental_backup/#restoring-an-incremental-backup-on-a-remote-host), a passwordless SSH/SCP connection must be established from the BART user account on the BART host to the remote user on the remote host (the remote user is specified by the `remote_host` parameter in the BART configuration file or by the `-r` option when using the `RESTORE` subcommand to restore the incremental backup).

-   Compression of archived WAL files in the BART backup catalog is not permitted for database servers on which incremental backups are to be taken. The `wal_compression` setting in the BART configuration file must be disabled for those database servers.

-   The incremental backup must be on the same timeline as the parent backup. The timeline changes after each recovery operation so an incremental backup cannot use a parent backup from an earlier timeline.

For information about configuring these requirements, see the EDB Backup and Recovery Installation and Upgrade Guide available at the [EDB website](/bart/latest/bart_inst/).

The following section provides an overview of the basic incremental backup concepts.
