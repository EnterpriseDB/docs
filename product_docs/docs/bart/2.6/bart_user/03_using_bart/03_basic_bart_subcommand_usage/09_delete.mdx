<div id="delete" class="registered_link"></div>

The `DELETE` subcommand removes the subdirectory and data files from the BART backup catalog for the specified backups along with its archived WAL files.

**Syntax:**

```text
bart DELETE –s <server_name>
  -i { all |
       [']{ <backup_id> | <backup_name> },... }[']
     }
  [ -n ]
```

!!! Note
    While invoking the `DELETE` subcommand, you must specify a specific database server.

For database servers under a retention policy, there are conditions where certain backups may not be deleted. See [Deletions Permitted Under a Retention Policy](../02_managing_backups_using_a_retention_policy/04_managing_the_backups_based_on_the_retention_policy/#deletions_permitted_under_retention_policy) for information about permitted backup deletions.

The following table describes the command options:

The `archived_wals` subdirectory no longer contains the WAL files of the backup.   |
