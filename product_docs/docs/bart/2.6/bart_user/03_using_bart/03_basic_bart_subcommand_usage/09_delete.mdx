<div id="delete" class="registered_link"></div>

The `DELETE` subcommand removes the subdirectory and data files from the BART backup catalog for the specified backups along with its archived WAL files.

**Syntax:**

```text
bart DELETE –s <server_name>
  -i { all |
       [']{ <backup_id> | <backup_name> },... }[']
     }
  [ -n ]
```

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

While invoking the `DELETE` subcommand, you must specify a specific database server.

</div>

For database servers under a retention policy, there are conditions where certain backups may not be deleted. See [Deletions Permitted Under a Retention Policy](../02_managing_backups_using_a_retention_policy/04_managing_the_backups_based_on_the_retention_policy/#deletions_permitted_under_retention_policy) for information about permitted backup deletions.

The following table describes the command options:

<table><thead><tr class="header"><th>Options</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr class="odd"><td><p><code>-s &lt;server_name&gt;</code><br />
<br />
<code>--server &lt;server_name&gt;</code></p></td><td><code>&lt;server_name&gt;</code> is the name of the database server whose backups are to be deleted.</td></tr><tr class="even"><td><p><code>-i &#123; all | [']&#123; &lt;backup_id&gt; | &lt;backup_name&gt; &#125;,... &#125;['] &#125;</code><br />
<br />
<code>--backupid &#123; all | [']&#123; &lt;backup_id&gt; | &lt;backup_name&gt; &#125;,... &#125;['] &#125;</code></p></td><td><p><code>&lt;backup_id&gt;</code> is the backup identifier of the backup to be deleted and <code>&lt;backup_name&gt;</code> is the user-defined alphanumeric name for the backup.<br />
Multiple backup identifiers and backup names may be specified in a comma-separated list. The list must be enclosed within single quotes if there is any white space appearing before or after each comma.<br />
If <code>all</code> is specified, all of the backups and their archived WAL files for the specified database server are deleted.</p></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><p><code>-n</code><br />
<code>--dry-run</code></p></td><td><p>Displays the results as if the deletions were done, however, no physical removal of the files are actually performed. In other words, a test run is performed so that you can see the potential results prior to actually initiating the action.<br />
After the deletion, the BART backup catalog for the database server no longer contains the corresponding directory for the deleted backup ID. The <code>archived_wals</code> subdirectory no longer contains the WAL files of the backup.</p></td></tr></tbody></table>
