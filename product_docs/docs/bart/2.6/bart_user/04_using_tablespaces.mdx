If the database cluster contains user-defined tablespaces (that is, tablespaces created with the `CREATE TABLESPACE` command):

-   You can take full backups with the `BACKUP` subcommand in either tar (`-Ft`) or plain text (`-Fp`) backup file format.
-   You must take incremental backups in the plain text (`-Fp`) backup file format.
-   You can take full backups using the transaction log streaming method (xlog_method = stream in the BART configuration file) `--with-pg_basebackup` and the `BACKUP` subcommand in either tar (`-Ft`) or plain text (`-Fp`) backup file format.

!!! Note
    If the particular database cluster you plan to back up contains tablespaces created by the `CREATE TABLESPACE` command, then you must set the `tablespace_path` parameter in the BART configuration file before you perform a BART `RESTORE` operation.

The `tablespace_path` parameter specifies the directory paths to which you want the tablespaces to be restored. It takes the following format:

 `OID_1=tablespace_path_1;OID_2=tablespace_path_2 ...`

Where `OID_1`, `OID_2`, … are the Object Identifiers of the tablespaces. You can find the OIDs of the tablespaces and their corresponding soft links to the directories by listing the contents of the `POSTGRES_INSTALL_HOME/data/pg_tblspc` subdirectory as shown in the following example:

```text
[root@localhost pg_tblspc ]# pwd
/opt/PostgresPlus/9.6AS/data/pg_tblspc
[root@localhost pg_tblspc]# ls -l
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 17 Aug 22 16:38 16644 -> /mnt/tablespace_1
lrwxrwxrwx 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 17 Aug 22 16:38 16645 -> /mnt/tablespace_2
```

The OIDs are `16644` and `16645` to directories `/mnt/tablespace_1` and `/mnt/tablespace_2`, respectively.

If you later wish to restore the tablespaces to the same locations as indicated in the preceding example, the BART configuration file must contain the following entry:

```text
[ACCTG]
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 5444
user = enterprisedb
cluster_owner = enterprisedb
tablespace_path = 16644=/mnt/tablespace_1;16645=/mnt/tablespace_2
description = "Accounting"
```

If you later wish to restore the tablespaces to different locations, specify the new directory locations in the `tablespace_path` parameter.

In either case, the directories specified in the `tablespace_path` parameter must exist and be empty at the time you perform the `BART RESTORE` operation.

If the database server is running on a remote host (in other words you are also using the `remote_host` configuration parameter or will specify the `--remote-host` option with the `RESTORE` subcommand), the specified tablespace directories must exist on the specified remote host.

To view example of backing up and restoring a database cluster on a remote host containing tablespaces, see the *EDB Backup and Recovery Reference Guide* available at the [EDB website](/bart/latest/bart_ref/).

The directories must be owned by the user account with which you intend to start the database server (typically the Postgres user account) with no access by other users or groups as is required for the directory path to which the main full backup is to be restored.

To view a sample BART managed backup and recovery system consisting of both local and remote database servers, see the *EDB Backup and Recovery Reference Guide* available at the [EDB website](/bart/latest/bart_ref/).
