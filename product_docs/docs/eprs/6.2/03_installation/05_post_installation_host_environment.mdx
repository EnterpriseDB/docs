On Linux hosts where you installed xDB Replication Server with the graphical user interface or from the command line, you should now have a publication server daemon and a subscription server daemon running on your computer assuming you chose to install the publication server and subscription server components. If you installed the xDB RPM package, you must start the publication server and the subscription server based upon the instructions in Section [Registering a Publication Server](../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) for the publication server and [Registering a Subscription Server](../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server) for the subscription server. On Windows systems, the publication server and subscription server run as services named `Publication Service` and `Subscription Service`.

The Postgres application menu contains a new item for the xDB Replication Console.

!!! Note
    On some Linux systems, you may have to restart the server before you can see the xDB Replication Console choice in the application menu. If the xDB Replication Console choice is still unavailable in the application menu, it can be started by invoking the script `XDB_HOME/bin/runRepConsole.sh`.

!!! Note
    For xDB Replication Server installed from an xDB RPM package, the xDB Replication Console is started by invoking the script `XDB_HOME/bin/runRepConsole.sh`.

The following files are created that you may need during the configuration process.

**Post-Installation Files**

!!! Note
    `XDB_HOME` is the directory where xDB Replication Server is installed.

!!! Note
    `POSTGRES_HOME` is the home directory of the postgres operating system account (enterprisedb for Advanced Server installed in Oracle compatible configuration mode).

!!! Note
    The publication and subscription services startup log files (`edb-xdbpubserver.log` and `edb-xdbsubserver.log`) are not generated for Windows and Mac OS X operating systems.

!!! Note
    `USER_HOME` is the home directory of the operating system account in use.

!!! Note
    The xDB Replication Server version number is represented by `x.x` or by `xx` (for example `6.2` or `62`).
