Uninstalling xDB Replication Server results in the removal of the publication server, the subscription server, the xDB Replication Console, the xDB Replication Server Command Line Interface, the xDB Replication Configuration file, the xDB Startup Configuration file, the publication server configuration file, and the subscription server configuration file.

Uninstalling xDB Replication Server does not remove any databases used as primary nodes, publication databases, or subscription databases.

Use the xDB Replication Console or the xDB Replication Server Command Line Interface to delete any existing single-master or multi-master replication systems before you uninstall xDB Replication Server, otherwise the control schema objects created in the publication databases or primary nodes will remain in those databases. These control schema objects must then be deleted manually such as by using an SQL command line utility.

If you installed xDB Replication Server using the xDB Replication Server installer program invoked from Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus as described in Section [Installing With Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus](01_installing_with_stackbuilder/#installing_with_stackbuilder) or you invoked the xDB Replication Server installer program from the command line as described in Section [Installing from the Command Line](02_installing_from_cli/#installing_from_cli), uninstall xDB Replication Server by invoking the `uninstall-xdbreplicationserver` script as described in this section.
