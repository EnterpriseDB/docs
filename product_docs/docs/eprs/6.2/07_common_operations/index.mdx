This chapter describes configuration and maintenance operations of xDB Replication Server that are common to both single-master and multi-master replication systems.

For configuration and management of your replication system, the xDB Replication Console graphical user interface is used to illustrate the steps and examples in this chapter. The same steps can be performed from the operating system command line using the xDB Replication Server Command Line Interface (CLI). The commands of the xDB Replication Server CLI utility are described in Chapter [xDB Replication Server Command Line Interface](../08_xdb_cli/#xdb_cli).

!!! Note
    Though most steps described in this chapter apply to both single-master and multi-master replication systems, those steps that apply only to single-master replication systems are noted with For SMR only. Those steps that apply only to multi-master replication systems are noted with For MMR only.
