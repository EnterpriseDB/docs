After a publication has been created, certain aspects of the underlying replication system environment might be subsequently altered for any number of reasons. Attributes that might change include the network location of the publication database server, the network location of the host running the publication server, database or operating system user names and passwords, and so forth.

The aforementioned information is saved in the replication system metadata when a publication is created. Changes to these attributes result in inaccurate replication system metadata, which in turn may result in errors during subsequent replication attempts or replication system administration.

This section describes how to update the metadata stored for the publication server, the publication database definition, and publications in order to keep the information consistent with the actual replication system environment.
