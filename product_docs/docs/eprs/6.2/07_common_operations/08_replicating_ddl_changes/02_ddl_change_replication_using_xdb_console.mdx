title: "DDL Change Replication Using the xDB Replication Console"

<div id="ddl_change_replication_using_xdb_console" class="registered_link"></div>

DDL change replication can be applied using the xDB Replication Console as follows.

**Step 1:** If you plan to use a file to supply the ALTER TABLE statements to a publication table, prepare the text file. Make sure this text file is accessible by the operating system account with which you will open the xDB Replication Console.

Alternatively, you can copy and paste, or directly type in the `ALTER TABLE` statements into the Alter Publication Table dialog box without having to save the statements in a file.

**Step 2:** Make sure the publication server whose node is the parent of the publication containing the table you wish to change is running and has been registered in the xDB Replication Console you are using. See [Registering a Publication Server](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) for directions on starting and registering a publication server.

**Step 3:** Under the publication database of a single-master replication system, or under the primary definition node of a multi-master replication system, open the Alter Publication Table dialog box by clicking the secondary mouse button on the Table node of the table to be modified and choose Alter Table.

**Step 4:** In the `Alter Publication Table` dialog box, if you saved the `ALTER TABLE` statements in a text file, make sure the DDL Script File option is selected, browse for this file, and click the `OK` button.

Alternatively, if you are directly entering the `ALTER TABLE` statements, select the DDL Script option instead of the DDL Script File option. Directly type in, or copy and paste the ALTER TABLE statements from your source into the text box. Click the `OK` button.

**Step 5:** If the `DDL replicated successfully message` box appears, the DDL change was successful across all databases. Click the `OK` button.

If DDL replication was not successful, the problem must be investigated and resolved on a case by case basis. Factors to look for include the following:

-   Were the modifications in the `ALTER TABLE` statements successfully applied to the target table in each database of the replication system?
-   For the trigger-based method, were the replication triggers on the target table modified to account for the `ALTER TABLE` statements?
-   For the trigger-based method, was the shadow table `RRST_schema_table` located in the `_edb_replicator_pub` schema in each database of the replication system modified to account for the `ALTER TABLE` statements?

If it is apparent that the replication system is not in a consistent state regarding the table definitions, see the beginning of Section [Validating a Publication](../06_managing_publication/05_validating_publication/#validating_publication) for guidance on how to deal with such issues.
