<div id="using_ssl_connections" class="registered_link"></div>

Publication server and subscription server connections to Postgres publication databases, Postgres subscription databases, and Postgres primary nodes can be accomplished using secure sockets layer (SSL) connectivity.

xDB Replication Server does not support SSL connections to Oracle and SQL Server databases used within any xDB replication system.

For a single-master replication system, the following connections can be made to Postgres databases enabled with SSL:

-   Publication server connection to the publication database and to the subscription databases.
-   Subscription server connection to the subscription databases.
-   Migration Toolkit connection to the publication and subscription databases.

For a multi-master replication system, the following connections can be made to Postgres databases enabled with SSL:

-   Publication server connection to the primary definition node and the non-PDN nodes.
-   Migration Toolkit connection to the primary definition node and the non-PDN nodes.

!!! Note
    SSL connections are not used from the xDB Replication Console or the xDB Replication Server Command Line Interface. The xDB user interfaces communicate with the publication server and subscription server, which in turn connect to the publication/subscription databases or primary nodes.

!!! Note
    The Migration Toolkit connection using SSL occurs within the context of the publication server and subscription server SSL connections. Therefore, there are no separate steps that you need to perform for the Migration Toolkit SSL connection.

Using SSL requires various prerequisite configuration steps performed on the database servers involved with the SSL connections as well as on the Java truststore and keystore on the hosts running the publication server and subscription server.

The Java truststore is the file containing the Certificate Authority (CA) certificates with which the Java client (the publication server and subscription server) uses to verify the authenticity of the server to which it is initiating an SSL connection.

The Java keystore is the file containing private and public keys and their corresponding certificates. The keystore is required for client authentication to the server, which is used for xDB Replication Server SSL connections.

The following is material to which you can refer to for guidance in setting up the SSL connections:

-   See the section on secure TCP connections with SSL in Chapter 17 *Server Setup and Operation* in the PostgreSQL Core Documentation located at:

> <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ssl-tcp.html>

for information on setting up SSL connectivity to Postgres database servers.

-   For information on JDBC client connectivity using SSL see the section on configuring the client in Chapter 4 *Using SSL* in the The PostgreSQL JDBC Interface (<https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/94/ssl.html>).

The following sections provide additional information for the configuration steps of using SSL with the xDB Replication Server.

-   Configuring SSL on a Postgres database server (Section [Configuring SSL on a Postgres Database Server](#configure_ssl_on_pg_db_server))
-   Configuring SSL on a JDBC client for the publication and subscription servers (Section [Configuring SSL for the Publication Server and Subscription Server](#configure_ssl_for_pub_and_sub_server))

## Configuring SSL on a Postgres Database Server

This section provides an example of configuring SSL on a Postgres database server to demonstrate the use of SSL with xDB Replication Server. A self-signed certificate is used for this purpose.

**Step 1:** Create the certificate signing request (CSR).

In the following example the generated certificate signing request file is `server.csr`. The private key is generated as file server.key.

```text
$ openssl req -new -text -nodes -subj '/C=US/ST=Massachusetts/L=Bedford/O=EnterpriseDB/OU=XDB/emailAddress=support@enterprisedb.com/CN=enterprisedb' -keyout server.key -out server.csr
Generating a 1024 bit RSA private key
......................................................++++++
.++++++
writing new private key to 'server.key'
-----
```

!!! Note
    When creating the certificate, the value specified for the common name field (designated as CN=enterprisedb in this example) must be the database user name that is specified in the User field of the Add Database or Update Database dialog box used when defining the publication database (see [Adding a Publication Database](../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/02_adding_pub_database/#adding_pub_database)), subscription database (see [Adding a Subscription Database](../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/02_adding_subscription_database/#adding_subscription_database)), or primary nodes (see [Adding the Primary definition node](../06_mmr_operation/02_creating_publication_mmr/#adding_pdn)) and [Creating Additional Primary nodes](../06_mmr_operation/03_creating_primary_nodes/#creating_primary_nodes)).

Alternatively, user name maps can be used as defined in the `pg_ident.conf` file to permit more flexibility for the common name and database user name. Steps 8 and 9 describe the use of user name maps.

**Step 2:** Generate the self-signed certificate.

The following generates a self-signed certificate to file `server.crt` using the certificate signing request file, `server.csr`, and the private key, `server.key`, as input.

```text
$ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt
Signature ok
subject=/C=US/ST=Massachusetts/L=Bedford/O=EnterpriseDB/OU=XDB/emailAddress=support@enterprisedb.com/CN=enterprisedb
Getting Private key
```

**Step 3:** Make a copy of the server certificate (`server.crt`) to be used as the root Certificate Authority (CA) file (`root.crt`).

```text
$ cp server.crt root.crt
```

**Step 4:** Delete the now redundant certificate signing request (`server.csr`).

```text
$ rm server.csr
```

**Step 5:** Move or copy the certificate and private key files to the Postgres database server data directory, `POSTGRES_INSTALL_HOME/data`.

```text
$ mv root.crt /opt/PostgresPlus/9.4AS/data
$ mv server.crt /opt/PostgresPlus/9.4AS/data
$ mv server.key /opt/PostgresPlus/9.4AS/data
```

**Step 6:** Set the file ownership and permissions on the certificate files and private key file.

Set the ownership to the operating system account that owns the data subdirectory of the Postgres database server, which is either `enterprisedb` or `postgres` depending upon the chosen installation mode (Oracle compatible or PostgreSQL compatible) when you installed your Postgres database server.

```text
$ chown enterprisedb root.crt server.crt server.key
$ chgrp enterprisedb root.crt server.crt server.key
$ chmod 600 root.crt server.crt server.key
$ ls -l
total 140
        .
        .
        .
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb  1346 Mar 15 09:31 root.crt
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb  1346 Mar 15 09:30 server.crt
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb  1704 Mar 15 09:28 server.key
```

**Step 7:** In the `postgresql.conf` file, make the following modifications.

```text
ssl = on                               # (change requires restart)
ssl_cert_file = 'server.crt'           # (change requires restart)
ssl_key_file = 'server.key'            # (change requires restart)
ssl_ca_file = 'root.crt'               # (change requires restart)
```

**Step 8:** Modify the `pg_hba.conf` file to enable SSL usage on the desired publication, subscription, or primary node databases.

In the `pg_hba.conf` file, the `hostssl` type indicates the entry is used to validate SSL connection attempts from the client (the publication server and the subscription server).

The authentication method is set to cert with the option clientcert=1 in order to require an SSL certificate from the client against which authentication is performed using the common name of the certificate (enterprisedb in this example).

The `map=sslusers` option specifies that a mapping named `sslusers` defined in the `pg_ident.conf` file is to be used for authentication. This mapping allows a connection to the database if the common name from the certificate and the database user name attempting the connection match the `SYSTEM-USERNAME/PG-USERNAME` pair listed in the `pg_ident.conf` file.

The following is an example of the settings in the `pg_hba.conf` file if the publication and subscription databases (edb and subnode) must use SSL connections.

```text
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER            ADDRESS                 METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                     md5
# IPv4 local connections:
hostssl   edb,subnode   all  192.168.2.0/24   cert clientcert=1 map=sslusers
```

**Step 9:** The following shows the user name maps in the pg_ident.conf file related to the `pg_hba.conf` file by the `map=sslusers` option. These user name maps permit you to specify database user names pubuser, subuser, MMRuser, or enterprisedb in the User field of the Add Database or Update Database dialog box when adding the publication, subscription, or primary node databases in the xDB Replication Console.

In other words, these are the permitted set of database user names that can be used by the publication server and subscription server to connect to the publication, subscription, or primary node databases.

```text
# MAPNAME       SYSTEM-USERNAME         PG-USERNAME
sslusers        enterprisedb            pubuser
sslusers        enterprisedb            subuser
sslusers        enterprisedb            MMRuser
sslusers        enterprisedb            enterprisedb
```

**Step 10:** Restart the Postgres database server after you have made the changes to the Postgres configuration files.

<div id="configure_ssl_for_pub_and_sub_server" class="registered_link"></div>

## Configuring SSL for the Publication Server and Subscription Server

After you have configured SSL on the Postgres database server, the following steps provide an example of generating a certificate and keystore file for the publication server and subscription server (the JDBC clients).

**Step 1:** Using files `server.crt` and server.key located under the Postgres database server data subdirectory, create copies of these files and move them to the host where the publication server and subscription server are running.

For this example, assume file `xdb.crt` is a copy of `server.crt` and `xdb.key` is a copy of `server.key`.

**Step 2:** Create a copy of `xdb.crt`.

```text
$ cp xdb.crt xdb_root.crt
$ ls -l
total 12
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1346 Mar 15 09:58 xdb.crt
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1704 Mar 15 09:58 xdb.key
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1346 Mar 15 10:00 xdb_root.crt
```

**Step 3:** Create a Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) format of file `xdb_root.crt`. The generated `DER` format of this file is `xdb_root.crt.der`. The `DER` format of the file is required for the keytool program in the next step.

```text
$ openssl x509 -in xdb_root.crt -out xdb_root.crt.der -outform der
$ ls -l
total 16
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1346 Mar 15 09:58 xdb.crt
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1704 Mar 15 09:58 xdb.key
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1346 Mar 15 10:00 xdb_root.crt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user  954 Mar 15 10:05 xdb_root.crt.der
```

**Step 4:** Use the keytool program to create a keystore file (`xdb.keystore`) using `xdb_root.crt.der` as the input. This process adds the certificate of the Postgres database server to the keystore file.

The keytool program can be found under the bin subdirectory of the Java Runtime Environment installation.

You will be prompted for a new password. Save this password for the next step.

```text
$ /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-1.7.0.45.x86_64/jre/bin/keytool -keystore xdb.keystore -alias xdbstore -import -file xdb_root.crt.der

-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user  954 Mar 15 10:05 xdb_root.crt.der
```

**Step 5:** Generate the encrypted form of the new password specified in the preceding step.

The encrypted password must be specified with the `sslTrustStorePassword` configuration option of the publication server configuration file for publication server SSL connections and the subscription server configuration file for subscription server SSL connections. (See [Publication and Subscription Server Configuration Options](../10_appendix/04_miscellaneous_xdb_processing_topics/01_publications_and_subscriptions_server_conf_options/#publications_and_subscriptions_server_conf_options) for information on the publication server and subscription server configuration files.)

Encrypt the password using the xDB Replication Server CLI encrypt command. The following example shows this process encrypting the password contained in file infile.

```text
$ export PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-1.7.0.45.x86_64/jre/bin:$PATH
$ cd /opt/PostgreSQL/EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer/bin
$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -encrypt -input ~/infile -output ~/pwdfile
$ cat ~/pwdfile
LGn6+AagiXqumxVHlOKk3w==
```

**Step 6:** Create a `PKCS #12` format of the keystore file (`xdb_pkcs.p12`) using files `xdb.crt` and `xdb.key` as input.

You will be prompted for a new password. Save this password for the next step.

```text
$ openssl pkcs12 -export -in xdb.crt -inkey xdb.key -out xdb_pkcs.p12
Enter Export Password:
Verifying - Enter Export Password:
$ ls -l
total 24
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1346 Mar 15 09:58 xdb.crt
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1704 Mar 15 09:58 xdb.key
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 1019 Mar 15 10:18 xdb.keystore
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 2557 Mar 15 10:34 xdb_pkcs.p12
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user 1346 Mar 15 10:00 xdb_root.crt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user  954 Mar 15 10:05 xdb_root.crt.der
```

**Step 7:** Generate the encrypted form of the new password specified in the preceding step.

The encrypted password must be specified with the sslKeyStorePassword configuration option of the publication server configuration file for publication server SSL connections and the subscription server configuration file for subscription server SSL connections.

Encrypt the password using the xDB Replication Server CLI encrypt command.

```text
$ export PATH=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.7.0-openjdk-1.7.0.45.x86_64/jre/bin:$PATH
$ cd /opt/PostgreSQL/EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer/bin
$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -encrypt -input ~/infile -output ~/pwdfile
$ cat ~/pwdfile
LGn6+AagiXqumxVHlOKk3w==
```

**Step 8:** Copy files `xdb.keystore` and `xdb_pkcs.p12` to a directory location where they are to be accessed by the publication server and subscription server.

**Step 9:** In the publication server and subscription server configuration files, set the location of file `xdb.keystore` with the `sslTrustStore` option and the location of file `xdb_pkcs.p12` with the `sslKeyStore` option.

The following shows the SSL configuration options set for the files generated in this example.

```text
sslTrustStore=/tmp/sslclient/xdb.keystore
sslTrustStorePassword=LGn6+AagiXqumxVHlOKk3w==
sslKeyStore=/tmp/sslclient/xdb_pkcs.p12
sslKeyStorePassword= ygJ9AxoJEX854elcVIJPTw==
```

The encrypted `sslTrustStorePassword` is obtained from Step 5 after being specified for the keytool program in Step 4.

The encrypted `sslKeyStorePassword` is obtained from Step 7 after being specified for the openssl pkcs12 program in Step 6.

Section [Summary of SSL Configuration Options](#summary_ssl_conf_options) contains a summary of the publication server and subscription server configuration options for SSL connections.

**Step 10:** Restart the publication and subscription servers.

**Configuring publication/subscription database in case of WAL stream changeset logging**

In the case of WAL stream changeset logging, while adding a publication or a subscription database that accepts only ssl connection, xDB validates if the database server is configured for logical replication using `libpq` connection.

For ssl connection, libpq must have the certificates and key as given in the following table. The default directory is `${user.home}/.postgresql`:

**Table 7-1: libpq/Client SSL File Usage**

|                              |                                      |                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| File Name                    | Contents                             | Description                                                                                                                    |
|``~/.postgresql/postgresql.crt`` | Client certificate                   | Requested by the server.                                                                                                       |
|``~/.postgresql/postgresql.key`` | Client private key                   | Proves that the client certificate is sent by the owner. However, does not indicate that the certificate owner is trustworthy. |
|``~/.postgresql/root.crt``       | Trusted certificate authorities (CA) | Checks that the server certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority.                                               |

Make sure that the name of the certificates and key is same as given in the above table.

!!! Note
    You need to execute the following commands to change the permission of the certificates in `${user.home}/.postgresql`:

```text
chmod 0644 root.crt postgresql.crt
chown postgres postgresql.key
```

To setup different source and target databaseb types (for example, source database `=POSTGRESQL` and target database `=enterprisedb`) follow the steps below:

1.  Generate the certificate for `POSTGRESQL` database and follow the table 7-1 for placing certificate files in the default directory.
2.  Copy these certificates in EDB Postgres Advanced Server data directory.

```text
[root@localhost data]# cp /var/lib/pgsql/11/data/root.crt .
[root@localhost data]# cp /var/lib/pgsql/11/data/server.crt .
[root@localhost data]# cp /var/lib/pgsql/11/data/server.key .
```

1.  Execute the following commands to change the permissions of the certificates in the EDB Postgres Advanced Server data directory.

```text
[root@localhost data]# sudo chown enterprisedb root.crt server.crt server.key
[root@localhost data]# sudo chgrp enterprisedb root.crt server.crt server.key
[root@localhost data]# sudo chmod 600 root.crt server.crt server.key
```

## Requesting SSL Connection to the xDB Replication Server Databases

Once SSL connectivity has been configured, a URL option must be supplied when configuring a single-master or multi-master replication system for those databases to which an SSL connection is intended to be used.

The SSL URL option informs Java to use SSL when the publication server or subscription server attempts to connect to an xDB Replication Server database (publication, subscription, or primary node database) on which the SSL URL option has been set to true.

The configuration steps where these options are specified are as follows:

-   For using SSL connections in a single-master replication system, the URL options must be specified as shown in Section [Adding a Publication Database](../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/02_adding_pub_database/#adding_pub_database) for the publication database and in Section [Adding a Subscription Database](../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/02_adding_subscription_database/#adding_subscription_database) for the subscription databases.
-   For using SSL connections in a multi-master replication system, the URL options must be specified as shown in Section [Adding the Primary definition node](../06_mmr_operation/02_creating_publication_mmr/#adding_pdn) for the primary definition node and in Section [Creating Additional Primary nodes](../06_mmr_operation/03_creating_primary_nodes/#creating_primary_nodes) for the non-PDN nodes.

For publication, subscription, and primary node databases, in the URL Options field of the Add Database or Update Database dialog box, enter the following:

`ssl=true`

The following is an example of the Add Database dialog box with the `ssl=true` URL option.

![Add Database with SSL URL option](../images/image290.png)

**Figure 7-112: Add Database with SSL URL option**

!!! Note
    If you no longer wish to use an SSL connection to an xDB Replication Server database, you must completely delete the `ssl=true` text from the URL Options field of the Add Database or Update Database dialog box. Simply changing true to false does not have the effect of disabling the SSL option.

<div id="summary_ssl_conf_options" class="registered_link"></div>

## Summary of SSL Configuration Options


The following is a summary of the publication server and subscription server configuration options that are applicable to SSL connections.

`sslTrustStoreType`

> The sslTrustStoreType option specifies the truststore format. Set this option to the Java truststore format of the client.

`sslTrustStoreType=truststore_format`

> The default value for truststore_format is jks for the JKS truststore file format.

`sslTrustStore`

> The xDB Replication Server uses the default Java truststore for SSL connectivity.

The typical default location of the truststore is in directory `JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security` or `JAVA_HOME/lib/security` in a file named `cacerts`. (`JAVA_HOME` is the Java installation directory.)

Specify the full directory path to the truststore file with this option. `sslTrustStore=truststore_file`

`sslTrustStorePassword`

> Encrypt the password for the Java system truststore using the xDB Replication Server CLI encrypt command (see [Encrypting Passwords](../08_xdb_cli/03_xdb_cli_commands/04_encrypt_password/#encrypt_password)) and specify the encrypted password with the `sslTrustStorePassword` option.
>
> `sslTrustStorePassword=encrypted_password`

`sslKeyStoreType`

> The `sslKeyStoreType` option specifies the keystore format. Set this option to the Java keystore format of the client.

`sslKeyStoreType=keystore_format`

> The default value for keystore_format is pkcs12 for the PKCS #12 keystore file format.

`sslKeyStore`

> Specify the full directory path to the keystore file with this option.
>
> `sslKeyStore=keystore_file`

`sslKeyStorePassword`

Encrypt the password for the Java system keystore using the xDB Replication Server CLI encrypt command (see [Encrypting Passwords](../08_xdb_cli/03_xdb_cli_commands/04_encrypt_password/#encrypt_password)) and specify the encrypted password with the sslKeyStorePassword option.

> `sslKeyStorePassword=encrypted_password`
