Once a schedule has been created, xDB Replication Server performs replications according to the schedule until the schedule is updated or removed.

The updating or removal of a schedule has no effect on a replication that has already been started. If a replication is in progress when the schedule is updated or removed, the in progress replication continues until completion.

## Updating a Schedule

The following steps illustrate how to change an existing schedule.

**Step 1 (For SMR only):** Make sure the subscription server whose node is the parent of the subscription you wish to change is running and has been registered in the xDB Replication Console you are using. See [Registering a Subscription Server](../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server) for directions on starting and registering a subscription server.

**Step 1 (For MMR only):** Make sure the publication server whose node is the parent of the controller database you wish to change is running and has been registered in the xDB Replication Console you are using. See [Registering a Publication Server](../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) for directions on starting and registering a publication server.

**Step 2 (For SMR only):** Select the Subscription node of the subscription for which you wish to update the schedule.

## Removing a Schedule

If you no longer wish replication to take place automatically, you must remove the schedule. You can always re-add a schedule or perform on demand replication.

**Step 1 (For SMR only):** Make sure the subscription server whose node is the parent of the subscription you wish to change is running and has been registered in the xDB Replication Console you are using. See Section [Registering a Subscription Server](../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server) for directions on starting and registering a subscription server.

**Step 1 (For MMR only):** Make sure the publication server whose node is the parent of the controller database you wish to change is running and has been registered in the xDB Replication Console you are using. See Section [Registering a Publication Server](../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) for directions on starting and registering a publication server.

**Step 2 (For SMR only):** Select the Subscription node of the subscription for which you wish to remove the schedule.
