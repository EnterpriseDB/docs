<div id="why_replication" class="registered_link"></div>


Replication of data can be employed in a variety of use cases in organizations where it is important to use the same data in multiple settings. This allows users to work with ‘real’ data that will yield ‘real’ results that are reliable in more than one setting. Support of both single-master and multi-master replication gives xDB Replication Server a broad range of supported use cases.

Some of the more popular uses of single-master replication include the following:

<div class="toctree" maxdepth="4">
