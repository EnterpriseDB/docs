In snapshot replication, the target tables are completely reloaded from the source tables. The database system’s truncate operation is used to delete all rows from the target tables.

**For Oracle and SQL Server only:** Oracle and SQL Server target tables are loaded using JDBC batches of `INSERT` statements.

**For Postgres only:** In general, Postgres target tables are loaded using the JDBC COPY command since using truncation and COPY is generally faster than if you were to execute an `SQL DELETE` statement against the entire table and then add the rows using JDBC batches of `INSERT` statements. If the `COPY` command fails, the publication server retries the snapshot using JDBC batches of `INSERT` statements.

If the target table (regardless of database type) contains a large object data type such as `BYTEA`, `BLOB`, or `CLOB` then rows are loaded one at a time per batch using an INSERT statement. This is to avoid a heap space error resulting from potentially large rows. Loading time can be decreased by allowing multiple inserts per batch, which is done by adjusting the configuration option `lobBatchSize` described in [Optimizing Snapshot Replication](../../05_smr_operation/08_optimizing_performance/01_optimizing_snapshot_replication/#optimizing_snapshot_replication).

!!! Note
    Advanced Server supports a number of aliases for data types. Such aliases that translate to `BYTEA` are treated as large object data types. See the Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Reference Guide for a listing of Advanced Server data types. (See the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer’s Guide* for Advanced Server version 9.5 or earlier versions.)

Under certain circumstances, the corresponding Postgres target table created for certain types of Oracle partitioned tables is a set of inherited tables. In these cases, the `SQL DELETE` statement is used on the inherited child tables instead of truncation. See [Replicating Oracle Partitioned Tables](../../10_appendix/04_miscellaneous_xdb_processing_topics/01_publications_and_subscriptions_server_conf_options/04_replicate_oracle_partitioned_tables/#replicate_oracle_partitioned_tables) for additional information on replicating Oracle partitioned tables.

A server configuration option is available that forces the snapshot replication process to use the Oracle database link utility instead of `JDBC COPY` to populate the Postgres target tables from an Oracle publication. Oracle database link provides an additional performance improvement over `JDBC COPY`. See [Optimizing Snapshot Replication](../../05_smr_operation/08_optimizing_performance/01_optimizing_snapshot_replication/#optimizing_snapshot_replication) for information on using the Oracle database link option.

See [Optimizing Snapshot Replication](../../05_smr_operation/08_optimizing_performance/01_optimizing_snapshot_replication/#optimizing_snapshot_replication) for information on various configuration options to optimize snapshot replication.
