When a publication is created in a single-master replication system, the publication can be defined as a snapshot-only publication. Replication from a snapshot-only publication can only be done using the snapshot replication method. Synchronization replication is not permitted on a snapshot-only publication.

A snapshot-only publication cannot be created in a multi-master replication system.

See [Performance Considerations](../04_design_replication_system/04_performance_considerations/#performance_considerations) for a discussion of the advantages of using a snapshot-only publication.
