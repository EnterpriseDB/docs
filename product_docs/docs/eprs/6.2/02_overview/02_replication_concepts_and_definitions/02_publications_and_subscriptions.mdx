xDB Replication Server uses an architecture called *publish* and *subscribe*. The data to be made available for copying by a replication system is defined as a publication. To get a copy of that data, you must `subscribe` to that publication. The manner in which you subscribe is slightly different for single-master and multi-master replication systems.

In xDB Replication Server a publication is defined as a named set of tables and views within a database. The database that contains the publication is called the publication database of that publication.

In a single-master replication system, to get a copy of an xDB Replication Server publication, you must create a subscription. An xDB Replication Server subscription is a named association of a publication to a database to which the publication is to be copied. This database is called the subscription database.

Similar to a single-master replication system, when creating a multi-master replication system, you first define a publication in the publication database. You then add one or more additional databases that you want to participate in this multi-master replication system. As you add each database, it is associated with this replication system. You do not create an explicit, named subscription in a multi-master replication system.

In a single-master replication system, replication is said to occur when xDB Replication Server initiates and completes either of the following processes:

1.  applies changes that have been made to rows in the publication since the last replication occurred, to rows in tables of the subscription database (called synchronization); or
2.  copies rows of the publication to empty tables of the subscription database (called a snapshot). See [Snapshot and Synchronization Overview](06_snapshot_and_synchronous/#snapshot_and_synchronous) for further discussion on snapshots and synchronization.

The subscription tables are the tables in the subscription database created from corresponding tables or views in the publication.

!!! Note
    In a single-master replication system xDB Replication Server creates a table in the subscription database for each view contained in the publication.

In a multi-master replication system, the concept and definition of replication is nearly identical to a single-master replication system with the following modifications:

1.  synchronization can occur between any pair of databases (referred to as primary nodes) participating in the replication system;
2.  a snapshot can occur from the publication database designated as the Primary Definition Node to any of the other primary nodes.

The following diagrams illustrate some basic single-master replication system examples.

The preceding diagram illustrates that a table that has been created as a member of a subscription can be used in a publication replicating to another subscription. This scenario is called cascading replication.

The following diagram illustrates a multi-master replication system with three primary nodes.
