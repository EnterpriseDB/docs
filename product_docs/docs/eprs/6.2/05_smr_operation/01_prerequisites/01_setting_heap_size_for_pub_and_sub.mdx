title: "Setting Heap Memory Size for the Publication and Subscription Servers"

<div id="setting_heap_size_for_pub_and_sub" class="registered_link"></div>

The publication server and the subscription server are configured to run with a default set of heap size parameters. Either the default settings for 32-bit platforms or the default settings for 64-bit platforms are set by parameter `JAVA_HEAP_SIZE` when xDB Replication Server is installed.

This parameter is configured in the xDB Startup Configuration file. See [xDB Startup Configuration File](../../02_overview/03_replication_server_components_and_architecture/01_physical_components/#xdb_startup_conf_file) for information on the xDB Startup Configuration file. The following is an example of the xDB Startup Configuration file.

```text
#!/bin/sh

JAVA_EXECUTABLE_PATH="/usr/bin/java"
JAVA_MINIMUM_VERSION=1.7
JAVA_BITNESS_REQUIRED=64
JAVA_HEAP_SIZE="-Xms256m -Xmx1536m"
PUBPORT=9051
SUBPORT=9052
```

On a 32-bit system, the initial heap size is set to 128 megabytes (-Xms128m) and the maximum limit is set to 512 megabytes (-Xmx512m). On a 64-bit system the initial heap size is 256 megabytes (-Xms256m) and the maximum limit is 1536 megabytes (-Xmx1536m).

Typically, these values can handle the average workloads. However, depending upon the average row size and pending backlog of replication updates, it may be beneficial to increase the default heap size settings.

The default values can be modified by changing the `JAVA_HEAP_SIZE` parameter setting in the xDB Startup Configuration file. Be sure to restart the publication server and the subscription server (see [Registering a Publication Server](../02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) and [Registering a Subscription Server](../03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server) ) after making such changes.

The heap size value should conform to the available RAM on the host running the publication server or subscription server. The basic guideline is that the maximum heap size should not exceed 25% of the total RAM size.

The following factors should also be considered.

If both the publication server and subscription server are running on the same host, then the minimum and recommended RAM capacity are shown by the following.

-   **Minimum RAM Size**. For a 32-bit system, use 4 gigabytes; for a 64-bit system use 8 gigabytes.
-   **Recommended RAM Size**. For a 32-bit system, use 8 gigabytes; for a 64-bit system use 16 gigabytes.

By default, both the publication server and subscription server are started and both are required for single-master replication systems. However if only multi-master replication systems are to be configured and used, then the subscription server is not needed. In such cases, the subscription server should be stopped to avoid redundant use of memory.

If both the publication server and the subscription server are running on the same host, then each server reserves its own heap buffer. Thus, the total heap size for both the publication and subscription servers, obtained by adding the maximum heap size for both servers, should comply with the available RAM on the host.
