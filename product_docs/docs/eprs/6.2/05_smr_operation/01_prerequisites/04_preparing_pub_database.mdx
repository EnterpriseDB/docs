<div id="preparing_pub_database" class="registered_link"></div>

This section discusses the preparation of a database that contains tables and views that will become members of publications.

The tables and views to be used for any given publication must all reside in the same database. This database becomes the publication database of that publication. A publication database user name must be created or already exist with the following characteristics:

-   The publication database user can connect to the publication database.
-   The publication database user has the privileges to create control schema objects to store metadata used for controlling and tracking the replication process.
-   The publication database user can read the tables and views that are to become members of publications.
-   For publications that will use synchronization replication with the trigger-based method, the publication database user can create triggers on the publication tables. (For Oracle, the publication database user must have trigger creation privilege even for snapshot-only publications, though triggers will only be created for publications using synchronization replication.)

The examples used throughout the rest of this user’s guide are based on the following:

-   The publication database user name is `pubuser`.
-   The tables and view used in publications reside in a schema named edb.
-   Three tables named `dept, emp`, and `jobhist` are members of schema `edb`.
-   One view named `salesemp` is a member of schema `edb`. This view is a SELECT statement over the `emp` table.
-   The Oracle system identifier (SID) of the publication database is `xe`. The SQL Server publication database name is edb. The Postgres publication database name is `edb`. (The cases of Oracle as the publication database, SQL Server as the publication database, and Postgres as the publication database are presented with examples in this section.)

For preparing an Oracle publication database, see the next section. For preparing a SQL Server publication database, see [SQL Server Publication Database](#sql_server_pub_db). For preparing a Postgres publication database, see [Postgres Publication Database](#postgres_pub_db).

## Oracle Publication Database

!!! Note
    (For Oracle 12c): The Oracle 12c multitenant architecture introduces the concept of the container database (CDB), which can contain multiple pluggable databases (PDBs). A pluggable database can be used as a publication database or a subscription database in a single-master replication system.

Oracle 12c still supports the usage of a single database referred to as a non-container database (non-CDB) that is compatible with Oracle versions prior to 12c. An Oracle 12c non-container database can also be used as a publication database or a subscription database in a single-master replication system.

The setup instructions for using an Oracle 12c publication database or subscription database are the same as for previous Oracle versions. Any special distinctions are indicated by a note within the instructions.

**Step 1:** Create a database user name for the publication database user. The publication database user name must have a password, and it must have the ability to create a database session. The publication database user becomes the owner of the control schema objects that will be created in the publication database to track, control, and record the replication process and history.

!!! Note Notes
    - (For Oracle 12c Pluggable Database): The publication database user can be an Oracle local user or a common user. The local user exists within and has access to only a single, user-created pluggable database (PDB), which is to be used as the publication database. Common user names typically begin with `C##` or `c##` and can access multiple pluggable databases.

    - (For Oracle 12c Pluggable Database): Creation and granting of privileges for a local user must be done while connected to the pluggable database to be used as the publication database. Creation of a common user must be done within the Oracle 12c root container `CDB$ROOT`. Granting of privileges to the common user must be done while connected to the pluggable database to be used as the publication database.

    - (For Oracle 12c Non-Container Database): Creation and granting of privileges to the publication database user are performed in the same manner as for Oracle versions prior to 12c.

    - If you enable flashback functionality for the Oracle published table, you must also give the publication database user flashback privileges for the table.  
      ```
      GRANT flashback ON schema_name.table_name to pubuser;
      ```

When creating the publication database definition, the publication database user name is entered in the Publication Service – Add Database dialog box (see [Adding a Publication Database](../02_creating_publication/02_adding_pub_database/#adding_pub_database)).

```text
CREATE USER pubuser IDENTIFIED BY password;
GRANT CONNECT TO pubuser;
```

**Step 2:** Grant the privileges needed to create the control schema objects. The control schema objects are created in the schema owned by, and with the same name as the publication database user. That is, the publication database user’s schema is the control schema for an Oracle publication database.

```text
GRANT RESOURCE TO pubuser;
```

**Step 3:** Grant the privileges required to create triggers on the publication tables. The `CREATE ANY TRIGGER` privilege must be granted to the publication database user.

```text
GRANT CREATE ANY TRIGGER TO pubuser;
```

**Step 4:** Grant the privileges required to lock publication tables when creating triggers. The `LOCK ANY TABLE` privilege must be granted to the publication database user.

```text
GRANT LOCK ANY TABLE TO pubuser;
```

**Step 5 (For Oracle 12c onward):** Grant the privileges required to access tablespaces. The `GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE` privilege must be granted to the publication database user. This requirement applies to both a pluggable database and a non-container database.

```text
GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO pubuser;
```
**Step 6 (For Oracle 19c onward):** `CREATE JOB` privilege is necessary for the publication database user to schedule a job.

This requirement applies to both pluggable as well as non-container databases.

```text
GRANT CREATE JOB TO pubuser;
```

**Step 7:** The publication database user must be able to read the tables and views that are to be included in publications.

```text
GRANT SELECT ON edb.dept TO pubuser;
GRANT SELECT ON edb.emp TO pubuser;
GRANT SELECT ON edb.jobhist TO pubuser;
GRANT SELECT ON edb.salesemp TO pubuser;
```

**Step 8 (Optional):** Create one or more `group` roles containing the required privileges to access the tables and views of the publications that will be needed by application users.

Using roles is convenient if you wish to add new application users who need privileges to `select, insert, update`, or `delete` from any of the publication tables. A role containing the required privileges can then be granted to the new users instead of granting each privilege individually to each user.

The following example shows the creation of the role and the granting of the privileges on the publication tables to the role:

```text
CREATE ROLE appgroup;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.dept TO appgroup;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.emp TO appgroup;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.jobhist TO appgroup;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.salesemp TO appgroup;
```

The following example shows the creation of a new user and the granting of the new role to the user:

```text
CREATE USER appuser IDENTIFIED BY password;
GRANT CREATE SESSION TO appuser;
GRANT appgroup TO appuser;
```

## SQL Server Publication Database

In SQL Server, an application gains access to the database server by supplying a SQL Server login and its associated password.

When an application connects to a particular database, the application assumes the identity and privileges of a database user that has been defined in that database. The database users in any given database are independent of database users in other databases with respect to their properties such as their role memberships and privileges. In fact, the same database user name can be defined in more than one database, each with its own distinct properties.

In each database, a database user can be mapped to a SQL Server login. When an application connects to a database using a SQL Server login to which a database user has been mapped, the application assumes the identity and privileges of that database user.

When using a SQL Server database as the publication database, a number of database users must be defined and mapped to a SQL Server login according to the following rules:

-   A SQL Server login must exist that is to be used by the publication server to connect to SQL Server. The SQL Server login and password are specified when creating the publication database definition.
-   In the publication database, a database user must exist that is to be the creator and owner of the control schema objects. This database user must be mapped to the SQL Server login used by the publication server.
-   A schema must exist to contain certain control schema objects. The database user, described in the preceding bullet point, must either own this schema or have certain privileges on this schema so that the database user can create and update the control schema objects in this schema. This schema is one physical schema component of the overall control schema and must also be defined as the default schema of that database user. The other physical schemas comprising the overall control schema are always created by the publication server as `_edb_replicator_pub`, `_edb_replicator_sub`, and `_edb_scheduler`.
-   The SQL Server database users that update the data in the application tables that are to be replicated must have certain privileges on the control schema objects. When an update on a replicated table occurs, a trigger fires that accesses and updates certain control schema objects. The appropriate privileges must be granted to SQL Server database users who require update access to the application tables.
-   A database user must exist in the msdb database that is mapped to the SQL Server login used by the publication server. This database user must have certain privileges to execute jobs in the dbo schema of the msdb database. (The msdb database is used by SQL Server Agent to schedule alerts and jobs. SQL Server Agent runs as a Windows service.)

This example uses the following SQL Server login, database users, and mappings to comply with the aforementioned rules:

-   The publication tables reside in database `edb`.
-   The database user owning the schema containing the publication tables and the publication tables, themselves, is `edb`.
-   The SQL Server login used by the publication server to connect to SQL Server is `pubuser`.
-   The database user owning the control schema objects and mapped to SQL Server login `pubuser` in database `edb` is `pubuser`.
-   The control schema used to contain certain control schema objects created by the publication server is pubuser. Other control schema objects are always created in `_edb_replicator_pub`, `_edb_replicator_sub`, and `_edb_scheduler`.
-   The database user mapped to SQL Server login `pubuser` in database `msdb` is `pubuser_msdb`.

!!! Note
    The sqlcmd utility program is used to execute the SQL statements in these examples. The USE command establishes the database to which the subsequent statements are to apply. The GO command executes the preceding SQL statements as a batch. Placement of the GO command within a stream of SQL statements sometimes has significance depending upon the particular SQL statements.

**Step 1:** Create a SQL Server login for the xDB Replication Server publication database user. The login must have a password. 

When creating the publication database definition, the SQL Server login is entered in the Publication Service – Add Database dialog box (see Section [Adding a Publication Database](../02_creating_publication/02_adding_pub_database/#adding_pub_database).

```text
USE primary;
GO
CREATE LOGIN pubuser WITH PASSWORD = 'password';
GO
```

**Step 2:** Create the database user and its required privileges for job scheduling in database `msdb`:

```text
USE msdb;
GO
CREATE USER pubuser_msdb FOR LOGIN pubuser;
GO
GRANT EXECUTE ON SCHEMA :: dbo TO pubuser_msdb;
GRANT SELECT ON SCHEMA :: dbo TO pubuser_msdb;
GO
```

**Step 3:** Create the database user for the control schema object creation and ownership. The control schema objects are created in the publication database to track, control, and record the replication process and history. This example assumes some of the control schema objects are to be created in the schema named `pubuser`.

!!! Note
    The schema name you specify in the `WITH DEFAULT_SCHEMA` clause must be the schema you choose in Step 5. This schema does not have to exist before using it in the `CREATE USER FOR LOGIN WITH DEFAULT_SCHEMA` statement.

```text
USE edb;
GO
CREATE USER pubuser FOR LOGIN pubuser WITH DEFAULT_SCHEMA = pubuser;
GO
```

!!! Note
    The remaining steps assume that the commands are given in the publication database (that is, the `USE` edb command has been previously given to establish the publication database `edb` as the current database.)

**Step 4:** Grant the database level privileges needed by the publication database user to create the control schema objects.

```text
GRANT CREATE TABLE TO pubuser;
GRANT CREATE PROCEDURE TO pubuser;
GRANT CREATE FUNCTION TO pubuser;
GRANT CREATE SCHEMA TO pubuser;
GO
```

**Step 5:** Choose the control schema where some of the control schema objects are to reside.

To create the control schema objects in a new schema owned by the publication database user and created exclusively for this purpose (recommended approach) issue the following command:

```text
CREATE SCHEMA pubuser AUTHORIZATION pubuser;
GO
```

Alternatively, to create the control schema objects in an existing schema such as in the same schema containing the publication tables (that is, schema `edb` in this example) use the following commands:

```text
GRANT ALTER   ON SCHEMA :: edb TO pubuser;
GRANT EXECUTE ON SCHEMA :: edb TO pubuser;
GRANT SELECT  ON SCHEMA :: edb TO pubuser;
GRANT INSERT  ON SCHEMA :: edb TO pubuser;
GRANT UPDATE  ON SCHEMA :: edb TO pubuser;
GRANT DELETE  ON SCHEMA :: edb TO pubuser;
GO
```

**Step 6:** Grant the privileges required to create triggers on the publication tables. The publication database user must have the `ALTER` privilege on the publication tables.

```text
GRANT ALTER ON edb.dept TO pubuser;
GRANT ALTER ON edb.emp TO pubuser;
GRANT ALTER ON edb.jobhist TO pubuser;
GO
```

**Step 7:** The publication database user must be able to read the tables and views that are to be included in publications.

```text
GRANT SELECT ON edb.dept TO pubuser;
GRANT SELECT ON edb.emp TO pubuser;
GRANT SELECT ON edb.jobhist TO pubuser;
GRANT SELECT ON edb.salesemp TO pubuser;
GO
```

**Step 8 (Optional):** Create one or more `group` roles containing the required privileges to access the tables and views of the publications that will be needed by application users.

!!! Note
    Creation of these roles can only be done after the SQL Server publication database definition has been created using the xDB Replication Console or xDB Replication Server CLI. (For example, see [Adding a Publication Database](../02_creating_publication/03_adding_publication/#adding_publication) for the xDB Replication Console usage.)

Using roles is convenient if you wish to add new application users who need privileges to select, insert, update, or delete from any of the publication tables. A role containing the required privileges can then be granted to the new users instead of granting each privilege individually to each user.

In addition to privileges on the publication tables, any user performing an insert, update, or delete operation on any of the publication tables requires privileges to certain control schema objects of the publication.

The following example shows the creation of the role `appgroup` and the granting of privileges on the publication tables to the role. The example assumes that in Step 5, schema pubuser was chosen as the control schema to store some of the control schema objects.

```text
CREATE ROLE appgroup AUTHORIZATION edb;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.dept TO appgroup;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.emp TO appgroup;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.jobhist TO appgroup;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.salesemp TO appgroup;
GRANT EXECUTE ON SCHEMA :: _edb_replicator_pub TO appgroup;
GRANT SELECT  ON SCHEMA :: _edb_replicator_pub TO appgroup;
GRANT INSERT  ON SCHEMA :: _edb_replicator_pub TO appgroup;
GRANT UPDATE  ON SCHEMA :: _edb_replicator_pub TO appgroup;
GRANT INSERT  ON SCHEMA :: pubuser TO appgroup;
GO
```

The following example shows the creation of a new login and database user, and the addition of the database user as a member of the role in order to inherit its privileges:

```text
CREATE LOGIN applogin WITH PASSWORD = 'password', DEFAULT_DATABASE = edb;
CREATE USER appuser FOR LOGIN applogin WITH DEFAULT_SCHEMA = edb;
EXEC sp_addrolemember @rolename = 'appgroup', @membername = 'appuser';
GO
```

!!! Note
    (Granting privileges to individual users): As previously described, each application database user that is to modify the data in any of the publication tables must be granted certain privileges on the publication tables and the control schema objects. Using a group role for this purpose as described earlier in this step helps simplify this process.

Individual database users can be granted the privileges to access the publication tables and the controls schema objects in a similar fashion.

The following example shows the creation of a new login and database user, and the granting of the privileges on the publication tables and the control schema objects to the user:

```text
CREATE LOGIN newlogin WITH PASSWORD = 'password', DEFAULT_DATABASE = edb;
CREATE USER newuser FOR LOGIN newlogin WITH DEFAULT_SCHEMA = edb;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.dept TO newuser;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.emp TO newuser;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.jobhist TO newuser;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.salesemp TO newuser;
GRANT EXECUTE ON SCHEMA :: _edb_replicator_pub TO newuser;
GRANT SELECT  ON SCHEMA :: _edb_replicator_pub TO newuser;
GRANT INSERT  ON SCHEMA :: _edb_replicator_pub TO newuser;
GRANT UPDATE  ON SCHEMA :: _edb_replicator_pub TO newuser;
GRANT INSERT  ON SCHEMA :: pubuser TO newuser;
GO
```

!!! Note
    Instead of using the preceding statements, which grant privileges at the schema level, a more granular level of privileges can be issued at the database object level using the following statements:

```text
CREATE LOGIN newlogin WITH PASSWORD = 'password', DEFAULT_DATABASE = edb;
CREATE USER newuser FOR LOGIN newlogin WITH DEFAULT_SCHEMA = edb;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.dept TO newuser;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.emp TO newuser;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.jobhist TO newuser;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.salesemp TO newuser;
GRANT INSERT  ON pubuser.rrst_edb_dept TO newuser;
GRANT INSERT  ON pubuser.rrst_edb_emp TO newuser;
GRANT INSERT  ON pubuser.rrst_edb_jobhist TO newuser;
GO
```

In addition, depending upon the version of SQL Server, grant the following additional privileges.

**For SQL Server 2008:** Grant the following privileges:

```text
GRANT EXECUTE ON _edb_replicator_pub.nextval TO newuser;
GRANT SELECT  ON _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_tx_seq TO newuser;
GRANT INSERT  ON _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_tx_seq TO newuser;
GO
```

**For SQL Server 2012, 2014:** Grant the following privileges:

```text
GRANT UPDATE ON _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_tx_seq TO newuser;
GRANT UPDATE ON _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_txset_seq TO newuser;
GRANT UPDATE ON _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_common_seq TO newuser;
GO
```

Using this approach, however, requires you to issue additional privileges for each application table that is later added to the publication.

## Postgres Publication Database

When creating the publication database definition, a database user name must be specified that has the following characteristics:

-   The database user can connect to the publication database.
-   The database user has superuser privileges. Superuser privileges are required because the database configuration parameter session_replication_role is altered by the database user to replica for snapshot operations involving replication of the control schema from one publication database to another.
-   The database user must have the ability to modify the system catalog tables in order to disable foreign key constraints on the control schema tables for snapshot operations involving replication of the control schema from one publication database to another. See [Disabling Foreign Key Constraints for Snapshot Replications](../../10_appendix/04_miscellaneous_xdb_processing_topics/04_disable_foreign_key_constraints_for_snapshot_replication/#disable_foreign_key_constraints_for_snapshot_replication) for more information on this requirement.

**Step 1:** Create a database superuser for the publication database user. The publication database user name must have a password, and it must have the ability to create a database session. The publication database user becomes the owner of the control schema objects that will be created in the publication database to track, control, and record the replication process and history.

When creating the publication database definition, the publication database user name is entered in the `Publication Service – Add Database dialog box`, see [Adding a Publication Database](../02_creating_publication/02_adding_pub_database/#adding_pub_database).

```text
CREATE ROLE pubuser WITH LOGIN SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'password';
```

**Step 2 (Optional):** Create one or more `group` roles containing the required privileges to access the tables and views of the publications that will be needed by application users.

!!! Note
    The process described in this step is applicable to Postgres publications in both single-master and multi-master replication systems.

Using roles is convenient if you wish to add new application users who need privileges to select, insert, update, or delete from any of the publication tables. A role containing the required privileges can then be granted to the new users instead of granting each privilege individually to each user.

Any user performing an `insert, update`, or `delete` operation on any of the publication tables requires privileges on the publication tables and its schema as well as to certain control schema objects of the publication. These control schema objects reside under schema `_edb_replicator_pub`.

The following example shows the creation of the role `appgroup` and the granting of privileges on the publication tables to the role.

```text
CREATE ROLE appgroup;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA edb TO appgroup;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.dept TO appgroup;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.emp TO appgroup;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.jobhist TO appgroup;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.salesemp TO appgroup;
```

In addition, for the log-based method of synchronization replication, if the `TRUNCATE` command is to be permitted on the publication tables, grant the following additional privileges:

```text
GRANT TRUNCATE ON edb.dept TO appgroup;
GRANT TRUNCATE ON edb.emp TO appgroup;
GRANT TRUNCATE ON edb.jobhist TO appgroup;
```

Also for the log-based method of synchronization replication for usage of the `TRUNCATE` command, grant the following privileges after creation of the publication database definition. See [Adding a Publication Database](../02_creating_publication/03_adding_publication/#adding_publication) for information on creating the publication database definition for a single-master replication system. For a multi-master replication system, [Adding the Primary definition node](../../06_mmr_operation/02_creating_publication_mmr/#adding_pdn).

```text
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA _edb_replicator_pub TO appgroup;
GRANT INSERT ON _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_wal_events_queue TO appgroup;
```

Finally, grant the group role to the desired database users. The following example shows the creation of a new user and the granting of the role to the user:

```text
CREATE ROLE appuser WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
GRANT appgroup TO appuser;
```

!!! Note
    (Granting privileges to roles after publication creation): Roles for containing publication table privileges should be created before you create the publication. (See [Adding a Publication](../02_creating_publication/03_adding_publication/#adding_publication) for information on creating a publication for a single-master replication system. For a multi-master replication system, see [Adding a Publication](../../06_mmr_operation/02_creating_publication_mmr/#add_pub_mmr).)

When you create the publication, the privileges that have been granted on the publication tables to roles that exist at the time, are applied to the control schema objects for those roles. So for the preceding example, the privileges required on the control schema objects for any publication created using `edb.dept`, `edb.emp`, `edb.jobhist`, or `edb.salesemp` are granted to role `appgroup` when you create that publication.

If, however, you create a role after the publication is created, you must explicitly grant the necessary privileges on the publication tables and control schema objects to the new role.

When using the trigger-based method of synchronization replication, a role must be granted the following privileges on the control schema objects:

-   `USAGE` privilege on schema `_edb_replicator_pub`.
-   `USAGE` privilege on sequence `rrep_tx_seq`.
-   `INSERT` privileges on the shadow tables corresponding to publication tables in which the role will be inserting, updating, or deleting rows. Shadow tables follow the naming convention `rrst_schema_table`. Note that shadow tables exist only if the trigger-based method of synchronization is to be used.

The following example shows the creation of a new role and the granting of the privileges on the publication tables and the control schema objects to the role for the trigger-based method of synchronization replication:

```text
CREATE ROLE newuser WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA edb TO newuser;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.dept TO newuser;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.emp TO newuser;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.jobhist TO newuser;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA _edb_replicator_pub TO newuser;
GRANT USAGE ON SEQUENCE _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_tx_seq TO newuser;
GRANT INSERT ON _edb_replicator_pub.rrst_edb_dept TO newuser;
GRANT INSERT ON _edb_replicator_pub.rrst_edb_emp TO newuser;
GRANT INSERT ON _edb_replicator_pub.rrst_edb_jobhist TO newuser;
```

When using the log-based method a role needs access to the publication tables and to certain control schema objects as well under certain circumstances.

When using the log-based method of synchronization replication, a role must be granted the following privileges on the control schema objects if the role is to be permitted to use the TRUNCATE command on the publication tables:

-   `USAGE privilege on schema _edb_replicator_pub`.
-   `INSERT` privilege on table `_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_wal_events_queue`.

The following example shows the creation of a new role and the granting of the privileges on the publication tables to the role for the log-based method of synchronization replication:

```text
CREATE ROLE newuser WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA edb TO newuser;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.dept TO newuser;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.emp TO newuser;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE ON edb.jobhist TO newuser;
```

In addition, if the `TRUNCATE` command is to be permitted on the publication tables, grant the following additional privileges:

```text
GRANT TRUNCATE ON edb.dept TO newuser;
GRANT TRUNCATE ON edb.emp TO newuser;
GRANT TRUNCATE ON edb.jobhist TO newuser;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA _edb_replicator_pub TO newuser;
GRANT INSERT ON _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_wal_events_queue TO newuser;
```
