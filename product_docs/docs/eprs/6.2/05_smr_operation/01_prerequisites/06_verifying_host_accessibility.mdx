<div id="verifying_host_accessibility" class="registered_link"></div>

If more than one computer is used to host the components of the replication system, each computer must be able to communicate with the others on a network. There are a number of different aspects of this topic as discussed in the following sections.

<div id="firewalls_and_access_to_ports" class="registered_link"></div>

## Firewalls and Access to Ports

Verify that the firewalls on the hosts allow access from the other hosts running replication system components. Refer to the directions for your host’s operating system to enable accessibility.

In addition if you are running the xDB Replication Console or the xDB Replication Server CLI on a different host than where the publication server or subscription server are running, be sure the firewall on the host running these servers allows access to the ports used by the publication server and subscription server.

The xDB Replication Console and xDB Replication Server CLI access the publication server and the subscription server using Java Remote Method Invocation (RMI) through the designated ports.

The publication server uses the port number you specified on the Publication Server Details screen in Step 16 of [Installing With Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus](../../03_installation/01_installing_with_stackbuilder/#installing_with_stackbuilder) as well the port offset by a value of 2 greater than this specified port number. So for a default publication server installation, access is required for port numbers `9051` and `9053`.

The subscription server uses the port number you specified on the Subscription Server Details screen in Step 17 of [Installing With Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus](../../03_installation/01_installing_with_stackbuilder/#installing_with_stackbuilder) as well as the port offset by a value of 2 greater than this specified port number. So for a default subscription server installation, access is required for port numbers `9052` and `9054`.

When you install xDB Replication Server, the port numbers you specify for the publication server and the subscription server are stored in the xDB Startup Configuration file as shown by the following example. See [xDB Startup Configuration File](../../02_overview/03_replication_server_components_and_architecture/01_physical_components/#xdb_startup_conf_file) for information on the xDB Startup Configuration file.

```text
#!/bin/sh

JAVA_EXECUTABLE_PATH="/usr/bin/java"
JAVA_MINIMUM_VERSION=1.7
JAVA_BITNESS_REQUIRED=64
JAVA_HEAP_SIZE="-Xms256m -Xmx1536m"
PUBPORT=9051
SUBPORT=9052
```

If you want to use different port numbers, modify the PUBPORT and SUBPORT entries in the xDB Startup Configuration file and restart the publication server and subscription server.

!!! Note
    If you change the port numbers for the publication server or subscription server for which there are existing replication systems, there are additional updates you must perform upon these existing replication systems.See [Subscription Server Network Location](../../07_common_operations/06_managing_publication/01_updating_publication_server/#sub_server_network_loc) for changes that must be made for the publication server metadata in the control schema if the port number used by the subscription server has been changed. See [Updating a Subscription](../05_managing_subscription/03_updating_subscription/#updating_subscription) for changes that must be made for the subscription metadata in the control schema if the port number used by the publication server has been changed.

## Network IP Addresses

When configuring a replication system, you must supply the network location of various components such as the publication server, subscription server, publication database server, and subscription database server. This information, consisting of the component’s IP address and port number, is stored in the control schema.

When one component needs to access another, it refers to the network location stored in the control schema.

During replication system configuration it is strongly suggested that you supply the actual network IP address of each component and avoid the usage of the `loopback` address, `localhost` or `127.x.x.x`, even if all components are running on the same host.

You can obtain the network IP address using the following command:

**For Linux only:** Use the `/sbin/ifconfig` command.

**For Windows only:** Open a Command Prompt window and use the `ipconfig` command.

The loopback address works as long as the communicating components are on the same host, but if at some future point, you decide to move a component to a different host on the network, the loopback address stored as the component’s network address in the control schema will no longer work for the component trying to make the connection.

**For Linux only:** You may need to modify the `/etc/hosts` file so that a host’s network IP address is associated with the host’s name.

!!! Note
    For an alternative to modifying the /etc/hosts file see [Assigning an IP Address for Remote Method Invocation](../../10_appendix/04_miscellaneous_xdb_processing_topics/01_publications_and_subscriptions_server_conf_options/07_assign_ip_adress_for_rmi/#assign_ip_adress_for_rmi).

The default configuration on Linux systems associates the host name with the loopback address in the `/etc/hosts` file as shown by the following example:

```text
127.0.0.1               localhost.localdomain localhost
```

This is also verified by using the hostname -i command, which returns the IP address associated with the host name:

```text
$ hostname -i
127.0.0.1
```

In these circumstances, certain xDB Replication Server components will have trouble locating its other components on the network as in the following cases:

-   When the user interface attempts to connect to the publication server or subscription server
-   When the subscription server attempts to connect to the publication server

If the loopback address `127.x.x.x` is returned such as in the preceding example, edit the `/etc/hosts` file so that the network IP address is associated with the host name instead.

The following example shows the modified /etc/hosts file so that the host name localhost is now associated with the network IP address `192.168.2.22` instead of the loopback address `127.0.0.1`:

```text
#127.0.0.1              localhost.localdomain localhost
192.168.2.22            localhost.localdomain localhost
::1                     localhost6.localdomain6 localhost6
```

On some Linux systems, you may need to restart the network service after you have modified the `/etc/hosts` file. This may be done a number of different ways depending upon the Linux system you are using as shown by the following variations:

```text
service network restart
/etc/init.d/networking restart
sudo /etc/init.d/networking restart
```

The following example illustrates the service network command:

```text
$ su root
Password:
$ service network restart
Shutting down loopback interface:                          [  OK  ]
Bringing up loopback interface:                            [  OK  ]
```

Use the following command for CentOS 7 or RHEL 7 and Rocky Linux 8 or AlmaLinux 8 or RHEL 8:

`systemctl restart network`

The `hostname -i` command now returns the network IP address of the host:

```text
$ hostname -i
192.168.2.22
```

## Postgres Server Authentication

#postgres-server-authentication

A Postgres database server uses the host-based authentication file, `pg_hba.conf`, to control access to the databases in the database server. You need to modify the `pg_hba.conf` file in the following locations:

-   On each Postgres database server that contains a Postgres publication database
-   On each Postgres database server that contains a Postgres subscription database

In a default Postgres installation, this file is located in the directory `POSTGRES_INSTALL_HOME/data`.

The modifications needed to the `pg_hba.conf` file for each of the aforementioned cases are discussed in the following sections.

**Postgres Publication Database**

For a Postgres publication database, the following is needed to allow access to the publication database:

```text
host pub_dbname    pub_dbuser    pub_ipaddr/32   md5
host pub_dbname    pub_dbuser    sub_ipaddr/32   md5
```

The value you substitute for `pub_dbname` is the name of the Postgres publication database you intend to use. The value you substitute for `pub_dbuser` is the publication database user name you created in Step 1 of [Postgres Publication Database](04_preparing_pub_database/#postgres_pub_db).

For a Postgres publication database named `edb`, the resulting `pg_hba.conf` file appears as follows:

```text
# TYPE  DATABASE    USER           ADDRESS           METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all         all                                md5
# IPv4 local connections:
host    edb         pubuser        192.168.2.22/32     md5
host    all         all            127.0.0.1/32        md5
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all         all            ::1/128             md5
# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
# replication privilege.
#local   replication  enterprisedb                      md5
#host    replication  enterprisedb  127.0.0.1/32        md5
#host    replication  enterprisedb  ::1/128             md5
```

!!! Note
    The preceding example assumes the publication server and the subscription server are running on the same host, hence the single entry for database `edb`. If the publication server and subscription server are running on separate hosts, then the `pg_hba.conf` file on the publication database server would look like the following:

```text
# TYPE  DATABASE    USER           ADDRESS           METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all         all                                md5
# IPv4 local connections:
host    edb         pubuser        192.168.2.22/32     md5
host    edb         pubuser        192.168.2.24/32     md5
host    all         all            127.0.0.1/32        md5
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all         all            ::1/128             md5
# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
# replication privilege.
#local   replication  enterprisedb                      md5
#host    replication  enterprisedb  127.0.0.1/32        md5
#host    replication  enterprisedb  ::1/128             md5
```

In addition, the preceding examples assume publication database edb is using the trigger-based method of synchronization replication. If the log-based method is used, the `pg_hba.conf` file must contain an additional entry with the DATABASE field set to replication for `pub_dbname`, `pub_dbuser`, and `pub_ipaddr` to allow replication connections from the publication server on the host on which it is running.

The following shows a modification of the preceding example with this additional entry as the last line in the file:

```text
# TYPE  DATABASE    USER           ADDRESS           METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all         all                                md5
# IPv4 local connections:
host    edb         pubuser        192.168.2.22/32     md5
host    edb         pubuser        192.168.2.24/32     md5
host    all         all            127.0.0.1/32        md5
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all         all            ::1/128             md5
# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
# replication privilege.
#local   replication  enterprisedb                      md5
#host    replication  enterprisedb  127.0.0.1/32        md5
#host    replication  enterprisedb  ::1/128             md5
host    replication  pubuser       192.168.2.22/32     md5
```

See [Synchronization Replication with the Log-Based Method](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/10_sync_replication_log_based/#sync_replication_log_based) and [Enabling Synchronization Replication with the Log-Based Method](02_enable_sync_replication_with_log-based_method/#enable_sync_replication_with_log-based_method) for additional information on synchronization replication with the log-based method.

Reload the configuration file after making the modifications.

Choose Reload Configuration (Expert Configuration, then Reload Configuration on Advanced Server) from the Postgres application menu. This will put the modified `pg_hba.conf` file into effect.

**Postgres Subscription Database**

For a Postgres subscription database, the following entries are needed to allow access to the subscription database:

```text
host sub_dbname    sub_dbuser    pub_ipaddr/32   md5
host sub_dbname    sub_dbuser    sub_ipaddr/32   md5
```

The values you substitute for sub_dbuser and sub_dbname are the subscription database user name and the subscription database name you created in steps 1 and 2 of [Postgres Subscription Database](05_preparing_sub_database/#postgres_sub_database).

For a Postgres subscription database named `subdb`, the resulting `pg_hba.conf` file appears as follows:

```text
# TYPE  DATABASE    USER           ADDRESS           METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all         all                                md5
# IPv4 local connections:
host    subdb       subuser        192.168.2.22/32     md5
host    all         all            127.0.0.1/32        md5
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all         all            ::1/128             md5
# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
# replication privilege.
#local   replication  enterprisedb                      md5
#host    replication  enterprisedb  127.0.0.1/32        md5
#host    replication  enterprisedb  ::1/128             md5
```

!!! Note
    The preceding example assumes that the publication server and the subscription server are running on the same host hence, only one entry is needed for database `subdb`. If the publication server and subscription server are running on separate hosts, then the `pg_hba.conf` file on the subscription database server looks like the following:

```text
# TYPE  DATABASE    USER           ADDRESS           METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all         all                                md5
# IPv4 local connections:
host    subdb       subuser        192.168.2.22/32     md5
host    subdb       subuser        192.168.2.24/32     md5
host    all         all            127.0.0.1/32        md5
# IPv6 local connections:
host    all         all             ::1/128            md5
# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the
# replication privilege.
#local   replication  enterprisedb                      md5
#host    replication  enterprisedb  127.0.0.1/32        md5
#host    replication  enterprisedb  ::1/128             md5
```

Reload the configuration file after making the modifications.

Choose Reload Configuration (Expert Configuration, then Reload Configuration on Advanced Server) from the Postgres application menu. This will put the modified `pg_hba.conf` file into effect.
