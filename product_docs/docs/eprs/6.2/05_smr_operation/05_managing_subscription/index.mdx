This section discusses various aspects of managing a subscription of a replication system. For a similar discussion on managing a publication of a replication system, see [Managing a Publication](../07_common_operations/06_managing_publication/#managing_publication).

After a subscription has been created, certain aspects of the underlying replication system environment might be subsequently altered for any number of reasons. Attributes that might change include the network location of the subscription database server, the network location of the host running the subscription server, database or operating system user names and passwords, and so forth.

The aforementioned information is saved in the replication system metadata when a subscription is created. Changes to these attributes result in inaccurate replication system metadata, which in turn may result in errors during subsequent replication attempts or replication system administration.

This section describes how to update the metadata stored for the subscription server, the subscription database definition, and subscriptions in order to keep the information consistent with the actual replication system environment.
