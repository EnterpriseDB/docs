When you register a subscription server in the xDB Replication Console, you may choose to save the subscription server’s network location (IP address and port number), admin user name, and encrypted password in a server login file on the computer on which you are running the xDB Replication Console. See [Saving Server Login Information](../../04_intro_xdb_console/#saving_server_login_info) for information on saving the login information.

The steps described in this section show you how to update the subscription server’s login information in the server login file.

It is assumed that the xDB Replication Console is open on your computer and the subscription server whose login information you wish to alter in the server login file, appears as a Subscription Server node in the xDB Replication Console’s replication tree.

You can perform the following actions on the server login file:

-   Change the subscription server’s login information (host IP address, port number, admin user name, and password) that you last saved in the server login file.
-   Delete the subscription server’s login information that is currently saved in the server login file. This is the default action, which will require you to register the subscription server again the next time you open the xDB Replication Console.
-   Resave the subscription server’s login information in the server login file. Each time you open the Update Subscription Server dialog box, you must choose to save the login information if you want it recorded in the server login file.

The following steps change only the content of the server login file residing on the host under the current xDB Replication Console user’s home directory. These changes do not alter any characteristic of the actual subscription server daemon (on Linux) or service (on Windows). These changes affect only how a subscription server is viewed through the xDB Replication Console on this host by this user.

**Step 1:**  
The subscription server whose login information you want to save, change, or delete in the server login file must be running before you can make any changes to the file. See Step 1 of [Registering a Subscription Server](../03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server) for directions on starting the subscription server.

**Step 2:** Click the secondary mouse button on the Subscription Server node and choose Update. The Update Subscription Server dialog box appears.

**Step 3:** Complete the fields in the dialog box according to your purpose for updating the server login file:

-   If the subscription server now runs on a host with a different IP address or port number than what is shown in the dialog box, enter the correct information. You must also enter the admin user name and password saved in the xDB Replication Configuration file that resides on the host identified by the IP address you entered in the Host field. Check the Save Login Information box if you want the new login information saved in the server login file, otherwise leave the box unchecked in which case, access to the subscription server is available for the current session, but subsequent sessions will require you to register the subscription server again.
-   If you want to delete previously saved login information, make sure the network location shown in the dialog box is still correct. Re-enter the admin user name and password saved in the xDB Replication Configuration file that resides on the host identified by the IP address in the Host field. Leave the Save Login Information box unchecked. Access to the subscription server is available for this session, but subsequent sessions will require you to register the subscription server again.
-   If you want to save the current login information shown in the dialog box, make sure the network location shown in the dialog box is correct. Re-enter the admin user name and password saved in the xDB Replication Configuration file that resides on the host identified by the IP address in the Host field. Check the Save Login Information box.

**Step 4:** Click the `Update` button. If the dialog box closes, then the update to the server login file was successful. Click the `Refresh` icon in the xDB Replication Console tool bar to show the updated Subscription Server node. If an error message appears after clicking the `Update` button, the server login file is not modified. Investigate and correct the cause of the error. Repeat steps 1 through 4.
