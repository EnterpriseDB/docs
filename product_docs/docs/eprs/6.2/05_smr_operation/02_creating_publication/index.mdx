<div id="creating_publication" class="registered_link"></div>

Creating your first publication requires the following steps:

-   Registering the publication server
-   Adding the publication database
-   Creating a publication by choosing the tables and views for the publication along with creating any optional filter clauses

Once the publication database has been added, as many publications can be created as there are available tables and views that are readable by the publication database user and that meet the criteria outlined in [Design Considerations](../../02_overview/04_design_replication_system/02_design_considerations/#design_considerations) and [Restrictions on Replicated Database Objects](../../02_overview/04_design_replication_system/03_restrictions_on_replicated_database_objects/#restrictions_on_replicated_database_objects).
