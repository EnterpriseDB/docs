After a publication and subscription are created, there are a couple of choices for starting the replication process.

-   Replication can be done immediately by taking an on demand snapshot.
-   Replication can be scheduled to start at a later date and time by creating a schedule.

This section discusses the procedure for initiating a replication on demand. Section [Creating a Schedule](../07_common_operations/#creating_schedule) discusses how to create a schedule.
