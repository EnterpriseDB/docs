title: "Other Synchronization Configuration Options"
---

The following are other configuration options affecting synchronization replication.

`syncBatchSize`

> The `syncBatchSize` option controls the number of statements in a synchronization replication JDBC batch.

`syncBatchSize=n`

> The default value for n is 100.

`syncFetchSize`

The `syncFetchSize` option controls how many rows are fetched from the publication database in one network round-trip. For example, if there are 1000 pending row changes, the default fetch size requires 5 database round-trips. Using a fetch size of 500 retrieves all changes in 2 round trips. Fine tune the performance by using a fetch size that conforms to the average data volume consumed by rows fetched in one round trip.

`syncFetchSize=n`

> The default value for n is 200.

`txSetMaxSize`

The `txSetMaxSize` option defines the maximum number of transactional rows that can be grouped in a single transaction set. The publication server loads and processes the changes by fetching as many rows in memory as grouped in a single transaction set.

> A higher value is expected to boost performance. However a very large value might result in an out of memory error. Increase/decrease the value in accordance with the average row size (low/high).

`txSetMaxSize=n`

> The default value for n is 10000.

`enablePerformanceStats`

Set `enablePerformanceStats` option to true only if you need to conduct performance testing and analyze the replication statistics. When enabled, the publication server creates additional triggers on the publication tables in each primary node. The triggers produce transaction statistics that are recorded in the MMR_transaction_history table in the control schema. This option should be disabled in a production environment to avoid performance overhead.

`enablePerformanceStats={true | false}`

> The default value is false.
