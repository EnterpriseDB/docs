Once you have become familiar with setting up and managing your replication system, you will often look for ways to optimize the performance of replications. This section discusses various publication server and subscription server configuration options available to improve the performance of snapshot and synchronization replications.

The publication server and subscription server configuration options are set in the publication server and subscription server configuration files, respectively. See [Publication and Subscription Server Configuration Options](../../10_appendix/04_miscellaneous_xdb_processing_topics/01_publications_and_subscriptions_server_conf_options/#publications_and_subscriptions_server_conf_options) for a detailed explanation of how to set the configuration options in these files.

!!! Note
    Most of these configuration options are applicable to multi-master replication systems as well. Options applicable to multi-master replication systems are those that apply to the publication server and are not specific to a database product other than Postgres (such as an Oracle feature).
