Maintenance items (bug fixes and enhancements) that have been added to this version of xDB Replication Server are listed below.

1.  Registering your xDB Replication Server product with an EnterpriseDB product license key is no longer required. Thus, all components related to registering the product have been removed. The following are the removed components:

> 1.  The `Product Registration` dialog box accessed from the xDB Replication Console `Help` menu,
> 2.  The `license_key` parameter located in the xDB Replication Configuration file, and
> 3.  The xDB Replication Server CLI `registerkey` command. (`43230`)

1.  Partitioned tables created using the declarative partitioning feature of PostgreSQL and Advanced Server version 10 can now be replicated in a log-based single-master or multi-master replication system. (`43134`)
2.  In an SMR system, removal of a table from a publication that has one or more existing subscriptions is now permitted. Previously, no tables from a publication in an SMR system could be removed if there are existing subscriptions. (`43110`)
