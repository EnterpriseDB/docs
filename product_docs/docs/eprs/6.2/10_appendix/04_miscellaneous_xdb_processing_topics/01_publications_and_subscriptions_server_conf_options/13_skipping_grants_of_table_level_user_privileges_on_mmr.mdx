!!! Note
    This option applies to the publication server only.

When creating non-PDN nodes in a multi-master replication system, the publication server creates the publication tables and their corresponding shadow tables in the non-PDN node database.

When `skipTablePrivileges` is set to false, which is the default value, the database user privileges on the publication tables in the primary definition node are granted to the same database users on the publication tables in the newly created non-PDN node.

The required privileges are also granted to these database users on the corresponding shadow tables in the non-PDN node so these database users can perform updates on the publication tables and the changes are recorded in the corresponding shadow tables. This enables proper synchronization replication of any such changes.

This granting of privileges occurs only for database users with privileges on the primary definition node publication tables at the time the non-PDN node is defined using the xDB Replication Console or the xDB Replication Server CLI. If you do not want the publication server to grant these database user privileges to the non-PDN publication tables and shadow tables when defining the non-PDN node, set `skipTablePrivileges` to true. In this case, you must explicitly grant the privileges on the publication tables and corresponding shadow tables in the non-PDN node for any database user that you wish to provide update access to on these tables. See Step 2 of Section [Postgres Publication Database](../../../05_smr_operation/01_prerequisites/04_preparing_pub_database/#postgres_pub_db) for information regarding the required privileges.

This usage would typically be for the case where different database users are to access the non-PDN node publication tables than the database users who access the primary definition node publication tables.

`skipTablePrivileges={true | false}`

The default value is `false`.
