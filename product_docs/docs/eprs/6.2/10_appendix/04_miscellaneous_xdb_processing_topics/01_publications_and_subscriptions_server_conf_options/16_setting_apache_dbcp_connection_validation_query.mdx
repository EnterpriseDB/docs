!!! Note
    This option applies to the publication server only.

The Apache Commons Database Connection Pooling (DBCP) component is the Apache pooling framework used by the publication server for establishing JDBC connections.

The `jdbc.pool.validationQueryTimeout` option controls the timeout setting when a validation query is executed at the time of allocating a connection from the pool. This is the amount of time in seconds before an exception is returned if the connection validation query does not succeed.

The default timeout value is 30 seconds. In situations where network connections are not reliable, the timeout value can be increased accordingly to allow more time for the connection attempt. Specify a value of 0 if no timeout is desired.

`jdbc.pool.validationQueryTimeout=n`

The default value is `30`.
