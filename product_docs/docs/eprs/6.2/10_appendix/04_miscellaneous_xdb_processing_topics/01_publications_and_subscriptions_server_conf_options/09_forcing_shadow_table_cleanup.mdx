The option described in this section applies to the publication server only.

A cleanup job is provided that can be run on demand or on a schedule to remove dead (processed) tuples from the shadow tables (see [Managing History](../../../07_common_operations/#managing_history)).

However, to perform even quicker cleanup scheduling, turn on this option to force the cleanup of shadow tables after every synchronization replication.

`postSyncShadowTableCleanup={true | false}`

The default value is `false.`
