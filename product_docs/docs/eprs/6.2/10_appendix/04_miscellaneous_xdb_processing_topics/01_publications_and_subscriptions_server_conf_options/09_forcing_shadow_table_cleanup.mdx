title: "Forcing Immediate Shadow Table Cleanup"

<div id="forcing_shadow_table_cleanup" class="registered_link"></div>

!!! Note
    The option described in this section applies to the publication server only.

A cleanup job is provided that can be run on demand or on a schedule to remove dead (processed) tuples from the shadow tables (see [Managing History](../../../07_common_operations/05_managing_history/#managing_history)).

However, to perform even quicker cleanup scheduling, turn on this option to force the cleanup of shadow tables after every synchronization replication.

`postSyncShadowTableCleanup={true | false}`

The default value is `false.`
