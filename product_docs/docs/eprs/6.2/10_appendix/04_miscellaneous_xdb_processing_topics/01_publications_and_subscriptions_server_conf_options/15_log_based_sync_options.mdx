!!! Note
    This option applies to the publication server only.

`walTxSetCreationInterval`

When using the log-based method of synchronization replication the `walTxSetCreationInterval` option controls the time interval between creations of the transaction sets, which affects the size of the transaction set (that is, the batch size). The default setting results in the creation of a transaction set every 5,000 milliseconds (5 seconds) assuming changes to the publication tables to be replicated are available.

This value should be adjusted based on the workload (that is, the transaction per minute (TPM) rate) on the target publication tables.

If the TPM rate is on a higher end, the walTxSetCreationInterval option should be set to a relatively low value.

If the TPM rate is on a lower end, the option should be set to a higher value to ensure that a transaction set is large enough to allow an average batch size in the range of 100 to 500 transactions.

`walTxSetCreationInterval=n` The default value is 5000 milliseconds.

`walStreamQueueLimit`

The `walStreamQueueLimit` option defines the upper limit for the number of WAL entries that can be held in the queue pending for processing at a point in time. Once the queue becomes full, the WAL stream receiver blocks additions until space becomes available in the queue as transaction entries are popped out of the queue for processing.

A value of 0 indicates there will be no upper limit. Note that too high a setting may result in Java heap space out of memory errors. See [Setting Heap Memory Size for the Publication and Subscription Servers](../../../05_smr_operation/01_prerequisites/01_setting_heap_size_for_pub_and_sub/#setting_heap_size_for_pub_and_sub) for information on adjusting the Java heap memory size.

`walStreamQueueLimit=n`

The default value is 10000.

`pendingTxSetThreshold`

The `pendingTxSetThreshold` option defines the upper threshold limit for the number of pending transaction sets that when reached, causes the extraction of transaction data from the WAL stream and its parsing to be put on hold until the pending transactions are processed.

This is to avoid a situation where the data is continuously pushed over the WAL stream channel, but is not being processed and applied due to some failure or lack of scheduling of the synchronization process. This may result in a Java heap space out of heap memory error. See [Setting Heap Memory Size for the Publication and Subscription Servers](../../../05_smr_operation/01_prerequisites/01_setting_heap_size_for_pub_and_sub/#setting_heap_size_for_pub_and_sub) for information on adjusting the Java heap memory size.

`pendingTxSetThreshold=n`

The default value is 10.
