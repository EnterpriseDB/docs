!!! Note
    The options described in this section apply to the publication server and the subscription server unless otherwise specified.

The following options control various aspects of message logging in the publication server log file, the subscription server log file, and the Migration Toolkit log file.

See [Publication and Subscription Server Startup Failures](../../03_resolving_problems/02_where_to_look_for_errors/#pub_and_sub_startup_failures) for additional information on the publication and subscription server log files.

See [Snapshot Replication Failures](../../03_resolving_problems/02_where_to_look_for_errors/#snapshot_replication_failures) for additional information on the Migration Toolkit log file.

`logging.level`

Set the `logging.level` option to control the severity of messages written to the publication server log file and the subscription server log file.

`logging.level={OFF | SEVERE | WARNING | INFO | CONFIG | FINE | FINER | FINEST | ALL}`

The default value is `WARNING`.

`logging.file.size`

Set the `logging.file.size` option to control the maximum file size (in megabytes) of the publication server log file and the subscription server log file.

!!! Note
    If logging.file.count is set to 0, the setting of logging.file.size is ignored. The log file is allowed to grow without limit.

`logging.file.size=n`

The default value is 50 megabytes.

`logging.file.count`

Set the `logging.file.count` option to control the number of files in the log file rotation history of the publication server log file and the subscription server log file.

`logging.file.count=n`

The default value for n is 20.

A non-zero value of n specifies the maximum number of log files that are to be created.

!!! Note
    In the remaining discussion the publication server log file named `pubserver.log` is used as an example. For the subscription server, the log file is named `subserver.log`.

-   Specify a value of 0 to disable log file rotation and create a single, unlimited size log file named `pubserver.log`. This log file will grow to an unlimited size ignoring any setting of logging.file.size.
-   Specify a value of 1 to disable log file rotation and create a single, limited size log file named `pubserver.log`. The log file is deleted and a new one is created each time the log file reaches the size limit set by `logging.file.size`.
-   Specify a value of 2 or greater to enable log file rotation. All log file names have an integer suffix (for example, `pubserver.log.0, pubserver.log.1, pubserver.log.2`).

When log file rotation is enabled, the log file with the greatest integer suffix contains the oldest messages. When there are enough messages to generate every file in the history rotation, the oldest messages are in `pubserver.log.n-1` where n is the setting of `logging.file.count`. Log file `pubserver.log.0` is the current, active log file containing the most recent messages.

When log file rotation is enabled and the current, active log file (`pubserver.log.0`) reaches the size specified by `logging.file.size`, then the following events occur:

-   The log file containing the oldest messages (`pubserver.log.n-1`) is deleted.
-   Each remaining log file is renamed with the next greater integer suffix (`pubserver.log.m` is renamed to `pubserver.log.m+1` with m varying from `0` to `n-2`).
-   A new, active log file is created (pubserver.log.0).

`mtk.logging.file.size`

!!! Note
    This option applies to the publication server only.

Set the `mtk.logging.file.size` option to control the maximum file size (in megabytes) of the Migration Toolkit log file.

`mtk.logging.file.size=n`

The default value is 50 megabytes.

`mtk.logging.file.count`

!!! Note
    This option applies to the publication server only.

Set the `mtk.logging.file.count` option to control the number of files in the log file rotation history of the Migration Toolkit log file.

`mtk.logging.file.count=n`

The default value for n is `20`.

A non-zero value of n specifies the maximum number of history log files that are to be created.

-   Specify a value of 0 to disable log file rotation and create a single, limited size log file named `mtk.log`. The log file is deleted and a new one is created each time the log file reaches the size limit set by `mtk.logging.file.size`.
-   Specify a value of 1 or greater to enable log file rotation. All log file names have an integer suffix (for example, `mtk.log.1, mtk.log.2`).

When log file rotation is enabled, the log file with the greatest integer suffix contains the oldest messages. When there are enough messages to generate every file in the history rotation, the oldest messages are in `mtk.log.n` where `n` is the setting of `mtk.logging.file.count`.

Log file `mtk.log` is the current, active log file containing the most recent messages.

When the current, active log file (`mtk.log`) reaches the size specified by `mtk.logging.file.size`, then the following events occur:

-   The log file containing the oldest messages (`mtk.log.n`) is deleted.
-   Each remaining log file with a suffix is renamed with the next greater integer suffix (`mtk.log.m` is renamed to `mtk.log.m+1` with `m` varying from `1` to `n-1`).
-   Log file `mtk.log` is renamed to `mtk.log.1`.
-   A new, active log file is created (`mtk.log`).
