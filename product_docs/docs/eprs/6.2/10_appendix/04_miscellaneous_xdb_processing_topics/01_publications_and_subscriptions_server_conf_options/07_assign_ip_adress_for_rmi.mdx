!!! Note
    The option described in this section applies to the publication server and the subscription server.

**For Linux only:**

An alternative method to modifying the `/etc/hosts` file so that the host name is associated with a non-loopback IP address as discussed in Section [Network IP Addressese](../../../05_smr_operation/01_prerequisites/06_verifying_host_accessibility/#network_ip) is to specify the network IP address using the java.rmi.server.hostname option.

In the publication server configuration file, set this option to the network IP address of the host running the publication server.

In the subscription server configuration file, set this option to the network IP address of the host running the subscription server.

`java.rmi.server.hostname=xxx.xxx.xx.xxx`

For example, instead of modifying the `/etc/hosts` file to look like the following for a publication or subscription server running on host `192.168.2.19`:

```text
#127.0.0.1              localhost.localdomain localhost
192.168.2.19             localhost.localdomain localhost
```

You can set the IP address in the server configuration file as shown by the following:

```text
#On Linux machines, the localhost to real IP may not give correct results. Hence
#users are advised to override the following property with server IP address
java.rmi.server.hostname=192.168.2.19
```
