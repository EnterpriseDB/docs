<div id="publications_and_subscriptions_server_conf_options" class="registered_link"></div>

The publication server and the subscription server support various configuration options for purposes such as the following:

-   Optimize synchronization performance based on the types of transactions affecting the publication. (See [Optimizing Synchronization Replication](../../../05_smr_operation/08_optimizing_performance/02_optimize_sync_replication/#optimize_sync_replication) for details on these particular options.)
-   Utilize alternate loading methods in snapshot replications. (See [Optimizing Snapshot Replication](../../../05_smr_operation/08_optimizing_performance/01_optimizing_snapshot_replication/#optimizing_snapshot_replication) for details on these particular options.)
-   Special configuration options for multi-master replication. (See [Optimizing Performance](../../../06_mmr_operation/12_optimizing_performance_mmr/#optimizing_performance_mmr) for details on these particular options.)
-   Adjust memory usage and transaction size for replications.
-   Replicate certain Oracle partitioned table types.
-   Replicate special characters found in publication data.
-   Special configuration options for the log-based method of synchronization replication. (See [Quoted Identifiers and Default Case Translation](../05_quoted_identifiers/#quoted_identifiers) for details on these particular options.)

Most options apply to the publication server only, although a few are used by the subscription server.

The configuration options for the publication server are set and passed in a text file called the publication server configuration file with file name `xdb_pubserver.conf.`

The configuration options for the subscription server are set and passed in a text file called the subscription server configuration file with file name `xdb_subserver.conf.`

See [Post Installation Host Environment](../../../03_installation/05_post_installation_host_environment/#post_installation_host_environment) for the directory locations of these files.

Modified publication server configuration options take effect after the publication server is restarted. Similarly, modified subscription server configuration options take effect after the subscription server is restarted. The configuration options that have been explicitly put into effect by overriding their defaults in the configuration files are logged in the publication server log file and the subscription server log file. Section [Post Installation Host Environment](../../../03_installation/05_post_installation_host_environment/#post_installation_host_environment) contains the directory locations of these log files.

The following is a description of how to set the configuration options. This is followed by sections describing the purpose of each option.

**Step 1:** The publication and subscription server configuration files are created during xDB Replication Server installation and already contain all of the configuration options as comments with their default settings.

To change the setting of a configuration option, edit the publication server or subscription server configuration file by removing the comment symbol (#) from the option and substituting the desired value in place of the currently coded value.

The following example shows a portion of the publication server configuration file where replacement of null characters in the publication data has been activated and the replacement character has been set to the question mark character.

```text
replaceNullChar = true

#Null Replacement Character
nullReplacementChar = ?
```

**Step 2:** Restart the publication or subscription server.

Use the following command for CentOS 7 or RHEL 7 and CentOS 8 or RHEL 8:

`systemctl restart edb-xdbpubserver`

Use the following command for previous Linux versions:

`service edb-xdbpubserver restart`

The following sections provide additional detail on the server configuration options.
