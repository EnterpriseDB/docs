!!! Note
    The option described in this section applies to the publication server only.

When the DDL change replication process is invoked, each affected table in the replication system is acquired in turn with an exclusive lock before the DDL change is applied to the table.

Set `ddlChangeTableLock` to false if you do not want an exclusive lock placed on the table before applying the DDL change. This option should be set to false only if there are no write transactions expected on the target table. If write transactions do occur, they may not be recorded by the replication system.

See [Replicating DDL Changes](../../../07_common_operations/08_replicating_ddl_changes/#replicating_ddl_changes) for information on DDL change replication.

`ddlChangeTableLock={true | false}`

The default value is `true`.
