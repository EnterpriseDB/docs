!!! Note
    The options described in this section apply to the publication server only unless otherwise specified.

The server configuration options discussed in this section apply to snapshot replications.

`escapeTabDelimiter`

When `JDBC COPY` is used in snapshot replication, the data delimiter between column values is an escaped tab character (t). Set this option to false if you do not want to escape the tab delimiter character.

`escapeTabDelimiter={true | false}`

The default value is `true`.

`mtkCopyDelimiter`

When `JDBC COPY` is used in snapshot replication, the data delimiter between column values is an escaped tab character (t). Set this option to change the data delimiter character.

`mtkCopyDelimiter=c`

`c` denotes the single replacement character for the data delimiter.

The default value is `\t.`

`enableConstBeforeDataLoad`

The `enableConstBeforeDataLoad` option controls whether or not table constraints, including triggers, are re-enabled before loading data into target tables. The default process is that the tables are loaded first, and then the constraints are enabled afterwards.

Activate this option if there are triggers that affect how data is loaded into the target tables.

If there are target tables created as sets of Postgres inherited tables resulting from partitioned Oracle source tables, then this option must be enabled.

`enableConstBeforeDataLoad={true | false}`

The default value is `false.`
