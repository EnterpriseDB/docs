If you need to change the password in the xDB Replication Configuration file, you must first encrypt the password. Use the encrypt command of the xDB Replication Server CLI to generate the encrypted form of the password from its plain text form given in an input file.

**Step 1:** Create a text file with the password you wish to encrypt. Do not leave any white space before or after the password.

The following example shows the text newpassword in the input file ``passfile``:

```text
$ cat passfile
newpassword
$
```

**Step 2:** Use the `edb-repcli.jar` file to execute the xDB Replication Server CLI with the encrypt command by first including the Java bin directory in your `PATH` environment variable and making ``XDB_HOME/bin`` your current working directory.

For example, assuming `/usr/bin` contains the java executable program and xDB Replication Server is installed into the `POSTGRES_INSTALL_HOME` directory, perform the following:

```text
$ export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH
$ cd /opt/PostgresPlus/9.4AS/bin
$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -encrypt -input ~/passfile -output ~/encrypted
The following shows the encrypted form of the password in the output file encrypted:
$ cat ~/encrypted
4mKq/4jQQoV2IypCSmPpTQ==
$
```

**Step 3:** Copy and paste the encrypted password into the xDB Replication Configuration file.

```text
#xDB Replication Server Configuration Properties
#Thu Sep 03 11:13:27 GMT-05:00 2015
admin_password=4mKq/4jQQoV2IypCSmPpTQ==
admin_user=admin
```
