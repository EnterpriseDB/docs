title: "Quoted Identifiers and Default Case Translation"

<div id="quoted_identifiers" class="registered_link"></div>

A quoted identifier is an identifier created with its name enclosed within double quote characters ``(")``. The text enclosed within double quotes is stored as the object identifier name exactly as given with no default case translation of alphabetic characters. Quoted identifiers occur in both Oracle and Postgres.

For example, `CREATE TABLE "MyTable"` … produces a table name that is stored in the database system’s data dictionary as MyTable. References to this table must be made using an uppercase M, an uppercase T, and lowercase letters for the rest of the name.

If a database object is created without the double quotes surrounding its identifier name, default case translation of alphabetic characters occurs.

In Oracle, the default case translation is to uppercase. For example, `CREATE TABLE MyTable` … would result in an object identifier name of `MYTABLE`.

In Postgres, the default case translation is to lowercase. For example, `CREATE TABLE MyTable …` would result in an object identifier name of mytable.
