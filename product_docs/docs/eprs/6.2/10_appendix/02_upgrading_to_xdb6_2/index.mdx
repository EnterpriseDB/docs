This section describes the process of installing xDB Replication Server 6.2 when you have existing single-master or multi-master replication systems that are running under xDB Replication Server version 6.1.x or 6.0.x.

It is assumed that you will be installing xDB Replication Server 6.2 on the same host machine that is currently running xDB Replication Server 6.1.x or 6.0.x, and that you will then manage the existing replication systems using xDB Replication Server 6.2.

A direct upgrade is supported only from xDB Replication Server versions 6.1.x or 6.0.x.

The following sections illustrate the upgrade process from xDB Replication Server 6.1. The same steps apply for upgrading from xDB Replication Server 6.0, but with different version numbers in the file and directory names of the older product.
