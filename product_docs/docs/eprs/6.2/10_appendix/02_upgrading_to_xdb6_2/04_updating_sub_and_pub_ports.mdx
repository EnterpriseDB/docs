The newly installed publication server and subscription server of xDB Replication Server 6.2 are configured to use the default port numbers 9051 and 9052, respectively. These port numbers are set in the xDB Startup Configuration file as described in Section [xDB Replication Configuration File](../../02_overview/03_replication_server_components_and_architecture/01_physical_components/#xdb_replication_conf_file).

If your xDB Replication Server 6.1.x replication systems were running under port numbers other than 9051 and 9052, some of your settings in xDB Replication Server 6.2 must be adjusted to continue to use these existing replication systems.

!!! Note
    The following changes regarding port ``9052`` and the subscription server are only needed if you are running a single-master replication system. If you are using only a multi-master replication system, then only the changes involving port ``9051`` and the publication server are needed.

There are two methods to correct this as summarized by the following two points:

-   To continue to use the old port numbers (other than ``9051`` and ``9052``) that were in use for xDB Replication Server 6.1.x, stop the publication and subscription servers. Change the settings of the `PUBPORT` and `SUBPORT` parameters in the xDB Startup Configuration file from ``9051`` and ``9052`` to the old port numbers used by xDB Replication Server 6.1.x. Restart the publication and subscription servers. Register the publication server and the subscription server with the old xDB Replication Server 6.1.x port numbers along with the admin user and password as described in sections [Registering a Publication Server](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) and [Registering a Subscription Server](../../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server).
-   To use the default port numbers ``9051`` and ``9052`` with the xDB Replication Server 6.1.x replication systems, you must replace the old port numbers with the default port numbers ``9051`` and ``9052``. Register the publication server and the subscription server with port numbers ``9051`` and ``9052`` along with the admin user and password as described in sections [Registering a Publication Server](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) and [Registering a Subscription Server](../../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server). For single-master replication systems only, you then need to change the port numbers stored in the control schema from the old port numbers to ``9051`` and ``9052``. First, perform the procedure described in Section [Subscription Server Network Location](../../07_common_operations/06_managing_publication/01_updating_publication_server/#sub_server_network_loc), and then perform the procedure described in Section [Updating a Subscription](../../05_smr_operation/05_managing_subscription/03_updating_subscription/#updating_subscription).

After making the changes as previously described, click the `Refresh` button of the xDB Replication Console. The replication tree of the xDB Replication Console should display the complete set of nodes for the replication systems.
