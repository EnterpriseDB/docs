<div id="error_messages" class="registered_link"></div>

The following section lists of certain error messages that can appear from the xDB Replication Console. The messages are listed in alphabetical order based on the first word in the message following `a, an,` or `the`.

When an error message is displayed by the xDB Replication Console, it may be followed by a specific reason as denoted by:

`Reason: reason_for_failure as in the following example:`

`Authentication failed. Reason: Invalid user name/password.`

The various specific reasons are not listed for all messages in the table.

This table also lists only the messages that typically involve initial configuration operations requiring additional information for resolving the problem. Messages related to less complicated corrections for simpler operations are not listed in this table.

## Error Messages and Resolutions

**Problem**

`Authentication failed. Reason: Invalid user name/password.`

**Resolution**

Occurs when registering a publication server or subscription server. Verify the user name and password you enter matches the admin user name and password in the xDB Replication Configuration file on the host you are running the publication server or subscription server. See [xDB Replication Configuration File](../../02_overview/03_replication_server_components_and_architecture/01_physical_components/#xdb_replication_conf_file).

**Problem**

Cannot register database because it is already registered by a publication service.

**Resolution**

Only one publication database definition can be created for any given database. (Oracle is the exception whereby more than one publication database definition can be created for the same Oracle database if different Oracle user names are specified in each publication database definition.)

**Problem**

`The connection could not be established with the server. Verify that the server is running and accepting connections. Reason: Connection refused to host: *xxx*.\ *xxx*.\ *xx*.\ *xxx*; nested exception is: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused`

**Resolution**

Occurs whenever a Java RMI connection cannot be made to the publication server, the subscription server, or a database server. Can occur when registering a publication or subscription server, adding a publication database or a subscription database, or identifying the publication server for a new subscription. Verify you have entered the correct host IP address and port number of the server. Verify the server is running (see [Starting the Publication Server or Subscription Server](04_troubleshooting_areas/#start_pub_or_sub_server)). If the server is running on Linux, verify that in the `/etc/hosts` file, the host name is mapped to the correct network IP address, which matches the IP address returned by the Linux `/sbin/ifconfig` command, and also matches the IP address you entered in the Host field of the dialog box. Alternatively, instead of modifying the /etc/hosts file, set configuration option `java.rmi.server.hostname` to the IP address of the publication or subscription server (see [Assigning an IP Address for Remote Method Invocation](../04_miscellaneous_xdb_processing_topics/01_publications_and_subscriptions_server_conf_options/07_assign_ip_adress_for_rmi/#assign_ip_adress_for_rmi) Do not use the loopback address `127.\ *x*.\ *x*.\ *x*` for this entry.

**Problem**

Connection refused. Check that the hostname and port are correct and that the postprimary is accepting TCP/IP connections.

**Resolution**

Occurs when attempting to save a publication database definition. The publication server cannot connect to the database server network location given in the Add Database dialog box. Verify that the correct IP address and port for the database server are given. Verify that the database server is running and is accessible from the host running the publication server.

**Problem**

`Could not connect to the database server. Reason: FATAL: number of requested standby connections exceeds max_wal_senders (currently *n*)`

**Resolution**

Occurs when attempting a snapshot replication from a publication database configured with the log-based method of synchronization replication (that is, WAL based logical replication), and the additional concurrent connection for logical replication exceeds the current setting, `n`, of the `max_wal_senders` configuration parameter in the `postgresql.conf file`. Increase the value of `max_wal_senders` in the `postgresql.conf` file of the database server running the publication database. Restart the database server containing the publication database. See [Synchronization Replication with the Log-Based Method](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/10_sync_replication_log_based/#sync_replication_log_based).

**Problem**

`Currently no publication exists on the publication server. Please create at least one publication on the server and then retry.`

**Resolution**

Occurs when attempting to create a subscription. If there are no publications in the specified publication server, then this error message is displayed.

**Problem**

`The database cannot be registered because a partial schema already exists. A manual cleanup is required to proceed. For help with manual cleanup please check out our product documentation.`

**Resolution**

The metadata database objects from a prior publication already exist in the schema under which the publication server is attempting to create new metadata database objects. Perform the operation described in Section [Deleting the Control Schema and Control Schema Objects](04_troubleshooting_areas/#del_control_schema_and%20objects).

**Problem**

`Database cannot be removed. Reason: Publication database connection cannot be removed as one or more publications are defined against it.`

**Resolution**

Make sure all publications subordinate to the publication database definition have been removed. If no publications appear under the Publication Database node in the xDB Replication Console replication tree and the error persists, there may be a problem with the control schema objects. Perform the operation described in Section [Deleting the Control Schema and Control Schema Objects](04_troubleshooting_areas/#del_control_schema_and%20objects).

**Problem**

Database cannot be removed. Reason: Publication service failed to clean up replication control schema tables.

**Resolution**

The control schema objects under the Oracle publication database user schema or under the Postgres or SQL Server schemas `\_edb_replicator_pub, \_edb_replicator_sub,` or `\_edb_scheduler` cannot be deleted by the publication server. The control schema objects or schemas may have already been deleted. The publication database definition cannot be removed using the xDB Replication Console. Perform the operation described in Section [Deleting the Control Schema and Control Schema Objects](04_troubleshooting_areas/#del_control_schema_and%20objects).

**Problem**

`Database cannot be removed. Reason: The target publication database is currently set as the Controller database and is being referenced by one or more dependent nodes.`

**Resolution**

Occurs when attempting to remove the publication database currently set as the controller database. Select another publication database to be used as the controller database. Use the Set As Controller option in the publication databasesâ€™ context menu to set this database as the controller database. You can then remove the original publication database. See [Switching the Controller Database](../../07_common_operations/07_switching_controller_db/#switching_controller_db).

**Problem**

`Database cannot be set as controller. Reason: Connection refused. Check that the hostname and port are correct and that the postprimary is accepting TCP/IP connections.`

**Resolution**

Occurs when attempting to set a publication database as the controller database and the database is not accessible by the publication server. Verify that the correct IP address and port has been defined in the publication database definition. Verify that the database server is running and is accessible from the host running the publication server.

**Problem**

`Database connection cannot be added. Connection refused. Check that the hostname and port are correct and that the postprimary is accepting TCP/IP connections.`

**Resolution**

Occurs when attempting to save a subscription database definition. The subscription server cannot connect to the database server network location given in the Add Database dialog box. Verify that the correct IP address and port for the database server are given. Verify that the database server is running and is accessible from the host running the subscription server.

**Problem**

`Database connection cannot be added. FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "*xxx*.\ *xxx*.\ *xx*.\ *xxx*", user "*user_name*", database "*db_name*", SSL off`

**Resolution**

Occurs when attempting to save a subscription database definition. The subscription server is not permitted to connect to the database at the network location given in the Add Database dialog box. Verify that the database host IP address, port number, database user name, password, and database identifier are correct. Verify there is an entry in the `pg_hba.conf` file permitting access to the database by the given user name originating from the IP address where the subscription server is running.

**Problem**

`Database connection cannot be added. Controller database is not initialized yet.`

**Resolution**

Occurs when attempting to add a subscription database. Verify that the xDB Replication Configuration file on the host running the subscription server contains an entry for a valid controller database. Verify that a publication database has been defined under the publication server as the controller database and its connection information is recorded in the xDB Replication Configuration file. See [xDB Replication Configuration File](../../02_overview/03_replication_server_components_and_architecture/01_physical_components/#xdb_replication_conf_file).

**Problem**

The database type for the selected database is different than that of the PDN database. Each database should be of the same type in a MMR cluster.

**Resolution**

All database servers in a multi-master replication system must be of the same type â€“ either all PostgreSQL (or Advanced Server installed in PostgreSQL compatible configuration mode); or all Advanced Server installed in Oracle compatible configuration mode. This error message is displayed when attempting to add a primary node and the database server type differs from the database server type of the primary definition node. See [Permitted MMR Database Server Configurations](../10_appendix/01_permitted_conf_and_permutations/#permitted_mmr_db_server_conf).

**Problem**

`An error occurred while removing tables from other Primary node(s). Please refer to the user manual for instructions on how to remove shadow tables and triggers from Primary node(s).`

**Resolution**

When a primary node of a multi-master replication system is deleted using the xDB Replication Console or the xDB Replication Server CLI, the control schema objects that were created in the primary node are also dropped. These include schemas `\_edb_replicator_pub, \_edb_replicator_sub,` and `\_edb_scheduler`. For the log-based method of synchronization replication there are shadow tables and triggers on the publication tables as well. If any of these control schema objects fail to be dropped, this error message is displayed. See [Dropping Replication Slots for Log-Based Synchronization Replication](04_troubleshooting_areas/#drop_replication_slots_for_log_based) for directions on how to remove these control schema objects.

**Problem**

`FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "*xxx*.\ *xxx*.\ *xx*.\ *xxx*", user "*user_name*", database "*db_name*", SSL off`

**Resolution**

Occurs when attempting to save a publication database definition. The publication server is not permitted to connect to the database at the network location given in the Add Database dialog box. Verify that the database host IP address, port number, database user name, password, and database identifier are correct. Verify there is an entry in the `pg_hba.conf` file permitting access to the database by the given user name originating from the IP address where the publication server is running.

**Problem**

`Filter cannot be defined for Binary data type column(s)e.g. BYTEA, BLOB, RAW.`

**Resolution**

Occurs when attempting to define a filter rule on a column with a binary data type in a publication table. Filter rules are not permitted on such columns. See Section [Table Settings and Restrictions for Table Filters](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/13_table_filters/#table_settings_and_restrictions_for_table_filters).

**Problem**

`Filter with same name/clause already exist on table/view: *schema*.\ *table_name*`

**Resolution**

When adding a filter rule on a publication table, the same filter name or the same filter clause (WHERE clause) cannot be used more than once on a given table. Modify the duplicate filter name or filter clause so it is unique for the table.

**Problem**

`The initial snapshot is not performed for this subscription. Please take the snapshot first and then proceed with the synchronize operation.`

**Resolution**

A snapshot replication must be performed before the first synchronization replication. Perform an on demand snapshot replication.

**Problem**

`It is recommended to use a network IP address, the loopback address may result in connectivity issues.`

**Resolution**

This warning is given when localhost or 127.0.0.1 is specified as the host address of a replication system component. If is strongly recommended that all replication system components are identified by their specific IP address on the network.

**Problem**

`The log triggers creation failed for one or more publication tables. Make sure the database is in valid state and user is granted the required privileges.`

**Resolution**

Either the user does not have the trigger creation privilege or there is a database server problem. The database server message is displayed as part of the error.

**Problem**

`The MMR mode is currently not supported for *database_type* database.`

**Resolution**

A database server of type *database_type* cannot be used in a multi-master replication system. Only Advanced Server or PostgreSQL database servers may be used as primary nodes in a multi-master replication system.

**Problem**

`Multiple filters of same table are not allowed.`

**Resolution**

When creating a subscription in a single-master replication system or creating a primary node other than the primary definition node in a multi-master replication system, only one filter may be selected for a given table. Uncheck the additional boxes in the Apply column under the Filter Rules tab if more than one box is selected.

**Problem**

`No JDBC Client driver is configured for the Oracle data source.`

**Resolution**

Occurs when creating an Oracle publication or subscription database definition. Copy the Oracle JDBC driver file `ojdbc\ *x*.jar` to subdirectory `lib/jdbc` of where the publication server or subscription server is installed on the host running the publication server or subscription server. Restart the publication server or subscription server.

**Problem**

`No Publication found on PDN node, additional Primary node cannot join MMR cluster.`

**Resolution**

Occurs when attempting to add a second primary node to a multi-master replication system, but no publication has been defined under the primary definition node. Create a publication under the primary definition node, then add the additional primary nodes. See [Adding a Publication](../../06_mmr_operation/02_creating_publication_mmr/#add_pub_mmr).

**Problem**

`None of the target master/subscription databases is accessible, hence the replication process failed to complete.`

**Resolution**

Synchronization replication failed due to the unavailability of a target database. See the publication server log file for details. See [Where to Look for Errors](02_where_to_look_for_errors/#where_to_look_for_errors).

**Problem**

`One or more primary database node(s) are defined against this publication. Removing the publication will invalidate the PDN.`

**Resolution**

Primary nodes are still defined in a multi-master replication system in which an attempt is being made to delete the publication from the primary definition node. All primary nodes (other than the primary definition node) must be deleted first before deleting the publication from the primary definition node. Perform this deletion process with the xDB Replication Console or xDB Replication Server CLI.

**Problem**

`One or more subscriptions are defined against this publication. Removing the publication will invalidate the subscription. Do you want to continue?`

**Resolution**

Warning issued when you attempt to remove a publication with subscriptions associated with it. You can remove the publication, but the subscriptions are no longer usable and should be removed as well.

**Problem**

`Multiple Publications creation is currently not supported.`

**Resolution**

Only one publication is supported in a multi-master replication system and only one such multi-master replication system can exist for an xDB Replication Server installation.

**Problem**

`Only subscription which has subscribed against a publication with transactional replication type, can be synchronized.`

**Resolution**

You cannot perform synchronization replication on a snapshot-only publication. Perform snapshot replication instead.

**Problem**

`The Oracle/MS SQL Server cannot be registered if the active Controller database is a non-PG/PPAS database.`

**Resolution**

Occurs when creating an Oracle or SQL Server publication database definition and the current controller database is not a Postgres database (that is, the controller database is an Oracle or SQL Server database). In order to create an Oracle or SQL Server publication database, create and designate a Postgres publication database as the controller database. See [Switching the Controller Database](../../07_common_operations/07_switching_controller_db/#switching_controller_db).

**Problem**

`Parent table *table_name* is not selected when its child tables are part of the publication list.`

**Resolution**

Table selected for a publication has a foreign key referencing a parent table that has not been chosen for the publication. This is only a warning that the parent table will not be part of the subscription.

**Problem**

`Problem occurred in publish process. Reason: Connection refused. Check that the hostname and port are correct and that the postprimary is accepting TCP/IP connections.`

**Resolution**

Occurs when attempting synchronization replication and the controller database is not accessible by the publication server. Verify that the correct IP address and port has been defined in the publication database definition of the controller database. Verify that the database server is running and is accessible from the host running the publication server.

**Problem**

`Problem occurred in publish process. Reason: ERROR: permission denied for schema \_edb_replicator_pub`

**Resolution**

For a Postgres publication, verify that the publication database user has `CREATE ON DATABASE` privilege on the publication database, or the database user is a superuser.

**Problem**

`Publication cannot be created. One or more tables have no attributes defined and cannot be published. Unselect the specific tables and retry.`

**Resolution**

In Postgres, it is possible to create a table with no columns. A publication is not allowed to include a Postgres table with no columns since the corresponding subscription table cannot be created in Oracle.

**Problem**

`Publication cannot be created. Publication *publication_name* already exists on the publisher server. Please choose a different name and then proceed.`

**Resolution**

Publication names must be unique within a publication server. Enter a different publication name.

**Problem**

`Publication cannot be created. Table *schema*.\ *table_name* replica identity is set to *replica_identity_setting*. To define a Filter, the table replica identity should be set to FULL.`

**Resolution**

Occurs when a table filter is attempted to be defined on a publication table used in a log-based replication system. Use the ALTER TABLE statement to change REPLICA IDENTITY to FULL. See [Table Settings and Restrictions for Table Filters](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/13_table_filters/#table_settings_and_restrictions_for_table_filters).

**Problem**

`Publication cannot be created. Table *table_name* does not contain a primary key. Transactional replication is not supported for a non-pk table.`

**Resolution**

All tables used for synchronization replication must have primary keys. Create a primary key on the table or add the table to a snapshot-only publication.

**Problem**

`Publication cannot be created. The publication creation process timed out as one or more tables may be locked by another session. Please retry later.`

**Resolution**

For a Postgres publication that is not for snapshot-only, the publication database user must be able to create triggers on the publication tables. In order to do this, the publication database user must have the privilege to execute the `ALTER TABLE` statement on the publication tables and the publication database user must have `CREATE` and `USAGE` privileges on the schema containing the publication tables. Verify that one of the following is true: 1) All the tables in the publication are owned by the publication database user and the user has `CREATE` and `USAGE` privileges on the publication tablesâ€™ schemas, or 2) the publication database user is a superuser.

**Problem**

`Publication cannot be removed. Reason: Publication *publication_name* cannot be removed. Reason: Error: cannot drop table \_edb_replicator_pub.rrst\_\ *schema_table_name* because other objects depend on it.`

**Resolution** PL/pgSQL custom conflict handler functions may exist in the primary definition node that are dependent upon the publicationâ€™s shadow tables. Drop the custom conflict handler functions before deleting the publication.

**Problem**

`Publication cannot be updated. Reason: The parent table *schema*.\ *table_name* is selected for removal while it has one or more child tables in the publication list. Make sure that parent-child dependency holds in the publication tables.`

**Resolution**

Choose the child tables for removal as well as the parent table.

**Problem**

`Publication defined in MMR cluster cannot be subscribed in SMR cluster.`

**Resolution**

A given publication cannot be used in both a multi-master replication system and a single-master replication system.

**Problem**

`Publication does not exist on the publication server. It might have been removed.`

**Resolution** The publication does not exist for a given subscription. The subscription is no longer usable and must be removed.

**Problem**

`Publication having subscription against it, cannot be updated by removing tables from it.`

**Resolution**

Remove the subscription, remove tables from the publication, then add the subscription.

**Problem**

`The publication schema cannot be created. Reason: ERROR: Permission denied for database *db_name*.`

**Resolution**

Occurs when attempting to create the publication database definition and the specified publication database user does not have the privilege to create a schema in database `db_name`. Grant the `CREATE` privilege on the database to the publication database user

**Problem**

`Publication Service connection failure.`

**Resolution**

Verify that the publication server is running. See [Starting the Publication Server or Subscription Server](04_troubleshooting_areas/#start_pub_or_sub_server). Verify that the database server hosting the controller database specified in the xDB Replication Configuration file is running and the publication server is connected to it. See [xDB Replication Configuration File](../../02_overview/03_replication_server_components_and_architecture/01_physical_components/#xdb_replication_conf_file).

**Problem**

`The replication process could not be completed due to a database failure. Check the database state and retry.`

**Resolution**

May be caused by characters in the publication data that are illegal for the character set of the subscription database. Check the snapshot replication failure log file or the database server log file. See [Replacing Null Characters](../04_miscellaneous_xdb_processing_topics/01_publications_and_subscriptions_server_conf_options/02_replacing_null_characters/#replacing_null_characters).

**Problem**

`Replication server does not support Oracle to Oracle replication.`

**Resolution** See [Permitted Configurations and Combinations](../02_upgrading_to_xdb6_2/01_permitted_conf_and_permutations/#permitted_conf_and_permutations) for supported database server configurations. Use Oracle products for Oracle to Oracle replication.

**Problem**

`A replication slot is not available on the target database server. Please configure the max_replication_slots GUC on the database server.`

**Resolution**

Occurs when attempting to add a publication database definition with the log-based method of synchronization replication, and the max_replication_slots configuration parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file is not set to a large enough value to accommodate the additional database. Increase the value of the max_replication_slots parameter and restart the database server. See [Synchronization Replication with the Log-Based Method](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/10_sync_replication_log_based/#sync_replication_log_based) for additional information.

**Problem**

`Subscription *subscription_name* already exists on the subscriber server. Please choose a different name and then proceed.`

**Resolution** Subscription names must be unique within a subscription server. Enter a different subscription name.

**Problem**

`Subscription *subscription_name* cannot be removed. Reason: Publication does not exist on the publication server.`

**Resolution** Warning issued if the subscription you are attempting to remove does not have an associated publication. You can still remove the subscription. Subscription database connection cannot be removed as one or more subscriptions are defined against it.

**Resolution** You cannot remove a subscription database definition if there are subordinate subscriptions. Remove the subscriptions first.

**Problem**

`Subscription does not exist on the subscription service. It might have been removed by some other user.`

**Resolution** The Subscription node you are trying to select no longer represents an existing subscription. The subscription may have been removed by a concurrent xDB Replication Console or xDB Replication Server CLI session. Click the Refresh icon in the xDB Replication Console toolbar to display the current replication tree.

**Problem**

`Subscription Service connection failure.`

**Resolution** Verify that the subscription server is running. See [Starting the Publication Server or Subscription Server](04_troubleshooting_areas/#start_pub_or_sub_server)

**Problem**

`Synchronize Publication process failed for one or more primary nodes. Please see logs for more details.`

**Resolution** Synchronization replication failed to complete for all target databases in the multi-master replication system due to the unavailability of some target database. See the publication server log file for details. See [Where to Look for Errors](02_where_to_look_for_errors/#where_to_look_for_errors). A table with large object type PK attribute cannot be published for (synchronize) incremental replication.

**Resolution** Oracle doesnâ€™t log changes for a large object column. Such a column cannot be referenced in the triggers that log changes to the shadow tables. Use snapshot-only replication instead.

**Problem**

`Test result: Failure`

`Database connection information test failed. Connection refused. Check that the hostname and port are correct and that the postprimary is accepting TCP/IP connections.`

**Resolution** Occurs when testing the connection of a publication or subscription database definition. The publication or subscription server cannot connect to the database server network location given in the Add Database dialog box. Verify that the correct IP address and port for the database server are given. Verify that the database server is running and is accessible from the host running the publication or subscription server.

**Problem**

`Test result: Failure`

`Database connection information test failed. FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "*xxx*.\ *xxx*.\ *xx*.\ *xxx*", user "*user_name*", database "*db_name*", SSL off`

**Resolution**

Occurs when testing the connection of a publication or subscription database definition. The publication or subscription server is not permitted to connect to the database at the network location given in the Add Database dialog box. Verify that the database host IP address, port number, database user name, password, and database identifier are correct. Verify there is an entry in the `pg_hba.conf` file permitting access to the database by the given user name originating from the IP address where the publication or subscription server is running.

**Problem**

`Test result: Failure`

`Database connection information test failed. IO exception: The Network Adapter could not establish the connection.`

**Resolution** Verify that the database server is running. For Oracle, verify that the Oracle listener program `lsnrctl` is running.

**Problem**

`Test result: Failure`

`The target database server cannot be registered for WAL based logical replication. Reason: The database server is not configured for logical replication. Reason: FATAL: must be superuser or replication role to start walsender.`

**Resolution** Occurs when attempting to add a publication database definition with the log-based method of synchronization replication (that is, WAL based logical replication), and the publication database user is not a superuser or does not have `REPLICATION` privilege. Grant the publication database user the appropriate privilege or specify a different database user who has the appropriate privilege for logical replication as the publication database user. See [Synchronization Replication with the Log-Based Method](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/10_sync_replication_log_based/#sync_replication_log_based).

**Problem**

`Test result: Failure`

`The target database server cannot be registered for WAL based logical replication. Reason: The database server is not configured for logical replication. Reason: FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry for replication connection from host "*xxx*.\ *xxx*.\ *xx*.\ *xxx*", user "*user_name*", SSL off`

**Resolution**

Occurs when attempting to add a publication database definition with the log-based method of synchronization replication (that is, WAL based logical replication), and there is no entry in the `pg_hba.conf` file where the DATABASE field is set to replication for `user_name`. The `pg_hba.conf` file of the target database server must contain a replication entry for the publication database user name specified when creating the publication database definition. See [Synchronization Replication with the Log-Based Method](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/10_sync_replication_log_based/#sync_replication_log_based).

**Problem**

`Test result: Failure`

`The target database server cannot be registered for WAL based logical replication. Reason: The database server is not configured for logical replication. Reason: FATAL: number of requested standby connections exceeds max_wal_senders (currently *n*)`

**Resolution** Occurs when attempting to add a publication database definition with the log-based method of synchronization replication (that is, WAL based logical replication), and the additional concurrent connection for logical replication exceeds the current setting, `n`, of the `max_wal_senders` configuration parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file. Increase the value of `max_wal_senders` in the `postgresql.conf` file of the database server running the publication database. Restart the database server containing the publication database. See [Synchronization Replication with the Log-Based Method](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/10_sync_replication_log_based/#sync_replication_log_based). 

**Problem**

`Test result: Failure`

`The target database server cannot be registered for WAL based logical replication. Reason: The target database server version `x.x` does not support WAL logical decoding.`

**Resolution**

Occurs when attempting to create a publication database definition with the log-based method of synchronization replication (that is, WAL based logical replication), and the Postgres database server is not version 9.4 or later. Only Postgres database servers of version 9.4 or later support the log-based method of synchronization replication. See [Synchronization Replication with the Log-Based Method](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/10_sync_replication_log_based/#sync_replication_log_based).

**Problem**

`Unable to apply DDL changes.`

**Resolution** The DDL statements in the text file specified for the DDL change replication feature contain syntax errors or are not supported by the DDL change replication feature. See [Replicating DDL Changes](../../07_common_operations/08_replicating_ddl_changes/#replicating_ddl_changes).

**Problem**

`Unable to communicate with remote server.`

**Resolution**

Occurs when attempting an operation such as performing synchronization replication or creating a schedule on a publication or subscription database that cannot be accessed by the xDB Replication Console. Verify that the publication and/or subscription servers are running. Verify that the database servers of the publication and/or subscription databases are running.

**Problem**

`Unable to create schema tables in target primary database.`

`Unable to create publication shadow tables.`

`Unable to create subscription schema tables.`

`DB-42501: com.edb.util.PSQLException: ERROR: permission denied for relation pg_class.`

**Resolution** Occurs when attempting to create an MMR publication database definition and the publication server is unable to create the control schema objects in the new publication database. This typically results when creating a second publication database definition and the publication server is unable to copy by snapshot the control schema objects from the controller database to the new publication database. The publication database user of the new publication database must be a superuser. In addition, in system catalog table `pg_catalog.pg_authid`, column `rolcatupdate` must be set to true for this superuser. See [Disabling Foreign Key Constraints for Snapshot Replications](../04_miscellaneous_xdb_processing_topics/04_disable_foreign_key_constraints_for_snapshot_replication/#disable_foreign_key_constraints_for_snapshot_replication).

**Problem**

`Unable to create Subscription subscription_name. Reason: Connection rejected: FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "*xxx*.\ *xxx*.\ *xx*.\ *xxx*" user "*user_name*", database "*db_name*", SSL off`

**Resolution**

Occurs when creating a subscription. The subscription server running on host `xxx.xxx.xx.xxx` could not access the controller database. Verify that the `pg_hba.conf` file on the controller database server permits access from the subscription server host

**Problem**

`Unable to create subscription schema tables. Org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "*xxx*.\ *xxx*.\ *xx*.\ *xxx*" user "*user_name*", database "*db_name*", SSL off`

**Resolution**

Occurs when creating a subscription. The subscription server running on host `xxx.xxx.xx.xxx` could not access the publication database. Verify that the `pg_hba.conf` file on the publication database server permits access from the subscription server host.

**Problem**

`Unable to create subscription schema tables. The database type is not supported.`

**Resolution**

The subscription database type is not supported for the intended publication database type. See [Permitted SMR Source and Target Configurations](../02_upgrading_to_xdb6_2/01_permitted_conf_and_permutations/#permitted_smr_source_and_target_conf) for a list of permitted source and target database server configurations.

**Problem**

`Unable to create subscription schema tables. The target database schema already contains one or more tables with the same name as the table(s) in the source database.`

**Resolution** The subscription server was unable to create a subscription table definition in the intended target schema. Typically, the reason is that a table with the same name already exists in the target schema of the subscription database. This can occur if you create a subscription, then remove it, but fail to drop the table definitions created under the target schema, then try to create the subscription a second time. Unable to create subscription schema tables.

**Problem**

`Unable to create publication shadow tables.`

`Unable to create subscription schema tables.`

`DB-42501: com.edb.util.PSQLException: ERROR: permission denied for relation pg_class.`

**Resolution** Occurs when attempting to create an SMR publication database definition and the publication server is unable to create the control schema objects in the new publication database. This typically results when creating a second publication database definition and the publication server is unable to copy by snapshot the control schema objects from the controller database to the new publication database. The publication database user of the new publication database must be a superuser. In addition, in system catalog table `pg_catalog.pg_authid`, column `rolcatupdate` must be set to true for this superuser. See [Disabling Foreign Key Constraints for Snapshot Replications](../04_miscellaneous_xdb_processing_topics/04_disable_foreign_key_constraints_for_snapshot_replication/#disable_foreign_key_constraints_for_snapshot_replication).

**Problem**

`Unable to perform snapshot for subscription `subscription_name`. Reason: DB-42501: com.edb.util.PSQLException: ERROR: permission denied for relation pg_class.`

**Resolution**

Occurs when attempting a snapshot replication. The database user of the database receiving the snapshot must be a superuser. In addition, in system catalog table `pg_catalog.pg_authid`, column `rolcatupdate` must be set to true for this `superuser`. See [Disabling Foreign Key Constraints for Snapshot Replications](../04_miscellaneous_xdb_processing_topics/04_disable_foreign_key_constraints_for_snapshot_replication/#disable_foreign_key_constraints_for_snapshot_replication).

**Problem**

`Unable to perform snapshot for subscription subscription_name. Reason: org.postgresql.util.PSQLException: FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "*xxx*.\ *xxx*.\ *xx*.\ *xxx*", user "*user_name*", database "*db_name*", SSL off`

**Resolution** 

Occurs when attempting a snapshot replication. The publication server running on host `xxx.xxx.xx.xxx could not access the subscription database. Verify that the `pg_hba.conf` file on the subscription database server permits access from the publication server host. Unable to synchronize. Reason: FATAL: no `pg_hba.conf` entry for host `xxx.xxx.xx.xxx`, user `user_name`, database `db_name`, SSL off

**Problem**

`Unable to synchronize. Reason: FATAL: no pg_hba.conf entry for host "xxx.xxx.xx.xxx", user "user_name", database "db_name", SSL off`

`Reason:` Occurs during an implicit synchronization following snapshot replication. The publication server running on host `xxx.xxx.xx.xxx` could not access the subscription serverâ€™s controller database. Verify that the `pg_hba.conf` file on the subscription server permits access from the publication server host using network address `xxx.xxx.xx.xxx`.

**Problem**

`Unable to update publication database information. Reason: Publication control schema does not exist on target database.`

**Resolution**

The control schema objects in the publication database may have been deleted or corrupted. For an Oracle publication database the control schema objects are located in the publication database userâ€™s schema. For a Postgres or SQL Server publication database the metadata database objects are located in schemas `\_edb_replicator_pub, \_edb_replicator_sub,` and `\_edb_scheduler`. See [Dropping Replication Slots for Log-Based Synchronization Replication](04_troubleshooting_areas/#drop_replication_slots_for_log_based).

**Problem**

`The user has insufficient privileges to manage publications. Grant required privileges as listed below and then proceed with operation.`

**Resolution** An Oracle publication database user must have `CONNECT, RESOURCE`, and `CREATE ANY TRIGGER` privileges.
