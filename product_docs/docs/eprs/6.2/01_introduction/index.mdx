This document describes the installation, configuration, architecture, and operation of the <span class="title-ref">EDB xDB Replication Server</span>. EDB xDB (cross database) Replication Server (referred to hereafter as <span class="title-ref">xDB Replication Server</span>) is an asynchronous replication system available for PostgreSQL and for EDB Postgres Advanced Server. The latter will be referred to simply as <span class="title-ref">Advanced Server</span>.

xDB Replication Server can be used to implement replication systems based on either of two different replication models – single-master (primary-to-secondary) replication or multi-master replication.

Regardless of the chosen replication model, xDB Replication Server is extremely flexible and easy to use.

For single-master replication, PostgreSQL, Advanced Server, Oracle, and Microsoft SQL Server are supported in an assortment of configurations (including cascading replication) allowing organizations to utilize it in multiple use cases with a variety of benefits.

The following are some combinations of cross database replications that xDB Replication Server supports for single-master replication:

-   From Oracle to PostgreSQL
-   From Oracle to Advanced Server
-   From SQL Server to PostgreSQL
-   From SQL Server to Advanced Server
-   From Advanced Server to Oracle
-   From PostgreSQL to SQL Server
-   From Advanced Server to SQL Server
-   Between PostgreSQL and Advanced Server
-   From PostgreSQL to Oracle (WAL mode)
-   From PostgreSQL to Oracle (trigger mode)

!!! Note
    Oracle Real Application Clusters (RAC) and Oracle Exadata are not supported by xDB Replication Server. These Oracle products have not been evaluated nor certified with xDB Replication Server.

For multi-master replication, xDB Replication Server supports the following configurations:

-   Between PostgreSQL database servers
-   Between PostgreSQL database servers and Advanced Servers in PostgreSQL compatible mode
-   Between Advanced Servers in PostgreSQL compatible mode
-   Between Advanced Servers in Oracle compatible mode

The reader is assumed to have basic SQL knowledge and basic Oracle, SQL Server, or PostgreSQL database administration skills (whichever are applicable) so that databases, users, schemas, and tables can be created and database object privileges assigned.
