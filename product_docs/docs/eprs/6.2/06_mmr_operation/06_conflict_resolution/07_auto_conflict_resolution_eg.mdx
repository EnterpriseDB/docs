This example illustrates a scenario where a transaction change originating from the first primary node is successfully applied to the second primary node, but conflicts with the third primary node. The conflict is resolved automatically.

The conflict resolution option is set to latest timestamp.

> There are a few situations where an update/update conflict may not be properly resolved according to the selected resolution options. These exceptions are described by the following.

**Update/Update Conflict on Column Where New Value is Identical to Original Value**

If there is an update to a publication table where the updated column value happens to be the same as the original column value, and then an update/update conflict occurs involving that column, there is the possibility that the final value of this column is not set according to the chosen conflict resolution option in one of the conflicting primary nodes. This is a known limitation.

For example, consider the following row in the `dept` table:

```text
deptno |   dname    |  loc
--------+------------+--------
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
First, the following UPDATE statement is given in the primary definition node:
edb=# UPDATE dept SET dname = 'OPERATIONS', loc = 'BEDFORD' WHERE deptno = 40;
UPDATE 1
edb=# SELECT * FROM dept WHERE deptno = 40;
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+---------
     40 | OPERATIONS | BEDFORD
(1 row)
```

!!! Note
    The original value, OPERATIONS, of column `dname` is the same as the value to which it is changed in the `UPDATE` statement.

The following `UPDATE` statement is then given in a second primary node:

```text
MMRnode=# UPDATE dept SET dname = 'LOGISTICS', loc = 'CAMBRIDGE' WHERE deptno = 40;
UPDATE 1
MMRnode=# SELECT * FROM dept WHERE deptno = 40;
 deptno |   dname   |    loc
--------+-----------+-----------
     40 | LOGISTICS | CAMBRIDGE
(1 row)
```

After a synchronization replication using the earliest timestamp conflict resolution option, the row in the primary definition node retains the update performed on it as expected since the update on the primary definition node occurred first.

```text
edb=# SELECT * FROM dept WHERE deptno = 40;
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+---------
     40 | OPERATIONS | BEDFORD
(1 row)
```

However the value of column `dname` in the second primary node remains set to LOGISTICS. It was not reverted back to the value `OPERATIONS` from the primary definition node as would normally be expected on a conflicting column. Note that as expected, the value in column `loc` is reverted from CAMBRIDGE back to the primary definition node value of `BEDFORD`.

```text
MMRnode=# SELECT * FROM dept WHERE deptno = 40;
 deptno |   dname   |   loc
--------+-----------+---------
     40 | LOGISTICS | BEDFORD
(1 row)
```

**Update/Update Conflict on Primary Key Columns**

An update/update conflict on the primary key column may not be consistently resolved according to the selected resolution option. That is, the column values may differ for the same row across multiple primary nodes following the synchronization replication.

In addition, this conflict may not appear under the Conflict History tab in the xDB Replication Console. Even if a conflict resolution entry does appear under the Conflict History tab, the actual primary key values may not be consistent across the nodes as implied by the conflict resolution.
