Another method for bringing all the publication tables to a consistent state is by removing any changes caused by the conflicting transactions and then issuing new, corrected transactions at one primary node, which you allow the multi-master replication system to synchronize to all other primary nodes.

Referring back to the uniqueness conflict on the dept table, instead of correcting the erroneous row and inserting the row into the primary node where it is missing as described in Section [Manual Publication Table Correction](04_manual_publication_table_correction/#manual_publication_table_correction), you can delete the conflicting rows from all primary nodes, then insert the correct row in one primary node and let the multi-master replication system synchronize the correct row to all primary nodes.

**Step 1:** Manually delete the inserted row from the publication tables in all primary nodes with `session_replication_role` set to `replica`.

On `MMRnode_a`, delete the erroneous row:

```text
MMRnode_a=# SHOW session_replication_role;
 session_replication_role
--------------------------
 replica
(1 row)


  MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM dept;
   deptno |   dname    |   loc
  --------+------------+----------
       10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
       20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
       30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
       40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
       50 | FINANCE    | CHICAGO
  (5 rows)


MMRnode_a=# DELETE FROM dept WHERE deptno = 50;
DELETE 1
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
(4 rows)
```

On `MMRnode_b`, delete the row even though the transaction created the correct result:

```text
MMRnode_b=# SHOW session_replication_role;
 session_replication_role
--------------------------
 replica
(1 row)


MMRnode_b=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)


MMRnode_b=# DELETE FROM dept WHERE deptno = 50;
DELETE 1
MMRnode_b=# SELECT * FROM dept;
deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
   10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
   20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
   30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
   40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
(4 rows)
```

On `MMRnode_c`, no changes are required as the conflicting transaction did not insert a new row into the table on this node:

```text
MMRnode_c=# SET search_path TO edb;
SET
MMRnode_c=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
(4 rows)
```

**Step 2:** Rerun the transaction on one primary node with the multi-master replication system running and with `session_replication_role` set to the default (`origin`).

For this example, the correct `INSERT` statement is executed on `MMRnode_a`: On `MMRnode_a`:

```text
MMRnode_a=# SHOW session_replication_role;
 session_replication_role
--------------------------
 origin
(1 row)


MMRnode_a=# INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50, 'MARKETING', 'LOS ANGELES');
INSERT 0 1
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

**Step 3:** Perform synchronization replication.

The same rows now appear in the publication table on all primary nodes. On `MMRnode_a`;

```text
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

On `MMRnode_b`:

```text
MMRnode_b=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

On `MMRnode_c`:

```text
MMRnode_c=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

**Step 4:** Update the shadow table entries for the conflicting transactions in the primary nodes to indicate that the conflict has been resolved as in Step 2 of Section [Manual Publication Table Correction](04_manual_publication_table_correction/#manual_publication_table_correction).

Change the `rrep_tx_conflict_status` column from `P` (pending) to `D` (discarded) on all primary nodes.

The resulting change for the shadow table on `MMRnode_a` is as follows.

**Figure 6-41: Discarded shadow table entry**

!!! Note
    The second entry for the accepted transaction you ran in Step 2 where `rrep_tx_conflict_status` is set to null indicating there was no conflict.

The resulting change for the shadow table on `MMRnode_b` is as follows.

![Discarded shadow table entry](../../../images/image152.png)

**Figure 6-42: Discarded shadow table entry**

There is no shadow table entry in `MMRnode_c`, since an insert transaction was not performed in that primary node by the application.

**Step 5:** In the control schema of the publication database currently designated as the controller database, modify the entries in the `xdb_conflicts` table to indicate the conflict has been resolved as in Step 3 of Section [Manual Publication Table Correction](04_manual_publication_table_correction/#manual_publication_table_correction).
