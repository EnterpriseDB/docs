title: "Custom Conflict Handling Function"

<div id="custom_conflict_handling_function" class="registered_link"></div>

An `update/update` conflict occurs if there is at least one conflicting column in the table.

A column is considered a conflicting column if it is updated on more than one primary node in the same synchronization. Even if the new, updated value for the column is identical in the conflicting update transactions, the fact that the same column was updated on more than one primary node makes it a conflicting column.

Each publication table must have its own custom conflict handling function to handle custom resolution for update/update conflicts on that particular publication table.

Custom conflict handling is designed to provide one of the following three outcomes based upon the setting of the resolution_code parameter, which is described later in this section.

-   **Columns are to be set to the source node.** When the resolution_code parameter of the function is set to a value of 1, the resultant setting of all columns in both conflicting nodes is obtained from the source node of the replication.
-   **Columns are to be set to the target node.** When the resolution_code parameter of the function is set to a value of 2, the resultant setting of all columns in both conflicting nodes is obtained from the target node of the replication.
-   **The function logic sets the column.** When the resolution_code parameter of the function is set to a value of 3, the resultant setting of the first conflicting column is obtained from the value returned in the source parameter coded within the function logic. The resultant setting of all other column values is obtained from the source node of the replication.

The following is an example of a custom conflict handling function where the conflicting columns are set to the target node.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION edb.custom_conflict_dept (
    INOUT   source              _edb_replicator_pub.rrst_edb_dept,
    IN      target              _edb_replicator_pub.rrst_edb_dept,
    IN      conflict_column     VARCHAR(255),
    OUT     resolution_message  VARCHAR(255),
    OUT     resolution_code     INTEGER
)
AS
$$
DECLARE
BEGIN
    resolution_code := 2;
    resolution_message := 'Custom conflict handling: Target node wins on edb.dept ';
END;
$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

If the multi-master replication system is configured with the log-based method of synchronization replication the shadow tables of the `INOUT` source and `IN` target parameters are replaced with the actual publication tables as shown by the following:

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION edb.custom_conflict_dept (
    INOUT   source              edb.dept,
    IN      target              edb.dept,
    IN      conflict_column     VARCHAR(255),
    OUT     resolution_message  VARCHAR(255),
    OUT     resolution_code     INTEGER
)
AS
$$
DECLARE
BEGIN
    resolution_code := 2;
    resolution_message := 'Custom conflict handling: Target node wins on edb.dept ';
END;
$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

The following is an example of a custom conflict handling function where the function logic determines the value of the first conflicting column.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION edb.custom_conflict_emp (
    INOUT   source              _edb_replicator_pub.rrst_edb_emp,
    IN      target              _edb_replicator_pub.rrst_edb_emp,
    IN      conflict_column     VARCHAR(255),
    OUT     resolution_message  VARCHAR(255),
    OUT     resolution_code     INTEGER
)
AS
$$
DECLARE
BEGIN
    resolution_code := 3;
    source.ename := 'Unknown';
    source.job := 'Unknown';
    source.mgr := 0;
    source.hiredate := '2013-01-01';
    source.sal := 0;
    source.comm := 0;
    resolution_message := 'Custom conflict handling: Defaults set on edb.emp';
END;
$$
LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

In this example, only the first conflicting column (based upon the column order within the table) is set to the value coded in the function. All other assignments to the source parameter are ignored. These other columns are set to the source node.

The following is a description of the function parameters.

**Parameters**

`source`

> `INOUT` parameter of the record type of the shadow table in schema `_edb_replicator_pub` of the primary definition node on which conflicts are to be resolved. If the log-based method of synchronization replication is used, specify the actual publication table instead of the shadow table. The input values are the column values from the source node. When resolution_code is set to a value of 3, set the columns in this parameter to the values that are to be used for the final outcome.

`target`

> IN parameter of the record type of the shadow table in schema `_edb_replicator_pub` of the primary definition node on which conflicts are to be resolved. If the log-based method of synchronization replication is used, specify the actual publication table instead of the shadow table. The input values are the column values from the target node.

`conflict_column`

> IN parameter of type `VARCHAR(255)` containing the name of the column on which the update/update conflict has occurred. If more than one column is involved in the conflict, the name of the first conflicting column is returned.

`resolution_message`

> OUT parameter of type VARCHAR(255) containing any informative message to be written to the publication server log file. The publication server configuration option logging.level must be set to at least the INFO level in order for the messages to appear in the publication server log file. See Section [Post Installation Host Environment](../../../03_installation/05_post_installation_host_environment/#post_installation_host_environment) for the location of the publication server log file.

`resolution_code`

> OUT parameter of type INTEGER that you set to one of the following values to determine how to resolve the conflict: 1 to use the column values of the source node of the replication for the final outcome, 2 to use the column values of the target node of the replication for the final outcome, or 3 to use the value set for the source `INOUT` parameter of the first conflicting column as the final outcome for that column.
