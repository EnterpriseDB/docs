title: "Control Schema Objects Created in Primary nodes"

<div id="control_schema_created_in_primary_nodes" class="registered_link"></div>

Creation of primary nodes results in the creation of control schema objects in each primary node database.

See [Control Schema Objects Created for a Publication](../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/04_control_schema_objects_created_for_publication/#control_schema_objects_created_for_publication) for the control schema objects created in each primary node.

Do not delete any of these control schema objects as the replication system metadata will become corrupted.

When you remove a primary node using the xDB Replication Console or xDB Replication Server CLI, all of its control schema objects are deleted from that primary node database.
