A current conflict resolution option on a publication table can be changed. See Section [Conflict Resolution](06_conflict_resolution/#conflict_resolution) for information on conflict resolution.

**Step 1:** Make sure the publication server whose node is the parent of the publication you wish to change is running and has been registered in the xDB Replication Console you are using. See Section [Registering a Publication Server](../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) for directions on starting and registering a publication server.

**Step 2:** Select the Publication node under the Publication Database node representing the primary definition node.
