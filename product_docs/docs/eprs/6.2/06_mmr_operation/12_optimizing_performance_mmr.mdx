Various publication server configuration options are available to optimize the performance of multi-master replication systems.

Almost all publication server performance related configuration options for single-master replication systems are equally applicable to multi-master replication systems (except when they are database produce specific, such as for Oracle). See [Optimizing Performance](#optimizing-performance) for a discussion of these options.

The publication server configuration options are set in the publication server configuration file. See Section [Publication and Subscription Server Configuration Options](../10_appendix/04_miscellaneous_xdb_processing_topics/01_publications_and_subscriptions_server_conf_options/#publications_and_subscriptions_server_conf_options) for a detailed explanation of how to set the configuration options in this file.

In addition, for configuration options specifically applicable to publication databases configured with the log-based method of synchronization replication, see Section [Log-Based Method of Synchronization Options](../10_appendix/04_miscellaneous_xdb_processing_topics/01_publications_and_subscriptions_server_conf_options/15_log_based_sync_options/#log_based_sync_options).

The following are some additional configuration options applicable to multi-master replication systems only.

`uniquenessConflictDetection`

The `uniquenessConflictDetection` option determines if uniqueness conflict needs to be detected at data load time or should be deferred to when data is applied against a target primary node. Possible values are `EAGER` and `LAZY`. Set it to `EAGER` if there is a high probability of duplicate inserts across primary nodes.

When the number of primary nodes is equal to two, then the conflict detection is performed in the default `LAZY` mode.

When the number of primary nodes is greater than two, then the conflict detection is always performed in EAGER mode. (A `LAZY` mode setting is ignored.) This is primarily required to avoid removing the already replicated conflicted changes from a target node, which otherwise is an expensive option.

`uniquenessConflictDetection={EAGER | LAZY}`

The default value is `LAZY` when the number of primary nodes is two.

`skipConflictDetection`

The `skipConflictDetection` option controls whether or not to skip conflict detection during synchronization replication. The default is false and should be changed only when the probability of data conflict across primary nodes is zero. For example if each primary node operates on an independent set of data then turning on this option `iMMRoves` the replication time.

`skipConflictDetection={true | false}`

The default value is false.

`deadlockRetryCount`

In a multi-master replication system, if a deadlock is detected on a target primary node, the `deadlockRetryCount` option controls the number of times the publication server attempts to retry application of the changes in the current replication cycle after waiting for the number of milliseconds specified by `deadlockWaitTime`. Set `deadlockRetryCount` to 0 to turn off this option in which case the failed changes are attempted in the next replication cycle.

`deadlockRetryCount=n`

The default value for n is 1.

`deadlockWaitTime`

The `deadlockWaitTime` option is used with the `deadlockRetryCount` option to set the wait time in milliseconds before the publication server attempts to retry application of the changes on the target primary node.

`deadlockRetryCount=n`\`

The default value for n is 1000.
