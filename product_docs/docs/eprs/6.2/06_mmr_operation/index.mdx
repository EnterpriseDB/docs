This chapter describes how to configure and run xDB Replication Server for multi-master replication systems.

For configuration and management of your replication system, the xDB Replication Console graphical user interface is used to illustrate the steps and examples in this chapter. The same steps can be performed from the operating system command line using the xDB Replication Server Command Line Interface (CLI). The commands of the xDB Replication Server CLI utility are described in Chapter [xDB Replication Server Command Line Interface](../08_xdb_cli/#xdb_cli).
