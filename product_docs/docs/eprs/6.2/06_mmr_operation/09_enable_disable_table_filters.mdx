Table filters must first be defined in a set of available table filters in the publication before they can be enabled on a primary node. See Section [Adding a Publication](02_creating_publication_mmr/#add_pub_mmr) for information on defining table filters in a multi-master replication system.

!!! Note
    See Section [Table Settings and Restrictions for Table Filters](../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/13_table_filters/#table_settings_and_restrictions_for_table_filters) for table setup requirements for a log-based replication system as well as general restrictions on the use of table filters.

The following are the steps for enabling or disabling table filters on an existing primary node.

**Step 1:** Make sure the publication server whose node is the parent of the primary nodes of the replication system is running and has been registered in the xDB Replication Console you are using. See Section [Registering a Publication Server](../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) for directions on starting and registering a publication server.

**Step 2:** Select the Publication Database node corresponding to the primary node on which you wish to enable or disable individual filter rules.

**Step 3:** Click the secondary mouse button on the Publication Database node and choose `Update Filter Rule`.

!!! Note
    If you wish to enable or disable filter rules on the current primary definition node, you must first switch the role of the primary definition node to another primary node in order to expose the Update Filter Rule option in the primary node context menu. See Section [Switching the Primary definition node](10_switching_pdn/#switching_pdn) for directions on switching the primary definition node.

The primary node you choose as the new primary definition node should contain a superset of, or at least an equivalent set of data as the current primary definition node. The reason for this is to ensure that the former primary definition node contains the complete set of data satisfying the filtering criteria after you take a snapshot from the new primary definition node to the former primary definition node on which you just enabled the table filters.

**Step 4:** In the `Filter Rules` tab check or uncheck the boxes to specify the filter rules to enable or disable on the primary node. At most one filter rule may be enabled on any given table. Click the `Save` button.

**Step 5:** A confirmation box appears presenting a warning message and a recommendation to perform a snapshot replication to any primary node on which you changed the filtering criteria.

Click the `Ok` button in the confirmation box to proceed with the update to the filter rule selections. Click the Cancel button to return to the Filter Rules tab if you wish to modify your filter rule selections.

**Step 6:** If you clicked the `Ok` button in the preceding step, the Filter Rules updated successfully confirmation message appears if the update was successful.

If you clicked the `Cancel` button in the preceding step, the Filter Rules tab reopens. You can modify your filter rule selections by repeating Step 4, or you can click the `Cancel` button in the Filter Rules tab to abort the filter rule updates on the primary node.

**Step 7:** It is strongly recommended that a snapshot replication be performed to the primary node that contains tables on which the filtering criteria has changed.

A snapshot ensures that the content of the primary node tables is consistent with the updated filtering criteria. See Section [Performing Snapshot Replication](05_on_demand_replication_mmr/#perform_snapshot_replication_mmr) for information on performing a snapshot replication.

!!! Note
    The primary definition node, which provides the source of the table content for a snapshot, should contain a superset of all the data contained in the other primary nodes of the multi-master replication system. This ensures that the target of the snapshot receives all of the data that satisfies the updated filtering criteria.

On the contrary, if the primary definition node contains only a subset of all the data contained in the other primary nodes, then a snapshot to another primary node may not result in the complete set of data that is required for that target primary node.
