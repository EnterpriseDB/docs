title: "Enabling Filters on a Subscription or Non-MDN Node (enablefilter)"

<div id="enable_filters_on_subscription_or_non_pdn_node" class="registered_link"></div>

The `enablefilter` command enables one or more filter rules on a single-master replication system subscription or on a multi-master replication system primary node other than the primary definition node.

The `enablefilter` command is used when it is desired to apply a filter rule to a subscription or a non-MDN node, but the filter rule did not yet exist or it was neglected to be included with the subscription or the non-MDN node when these components were initially created.

Synopsis

```text
-enablefilter
  -repsvrfile pubsvrfile
{ -subname subname | -dbid dbid }
  -filterids filterid_1 [ filterid_2 ] ...
```

Enabling a filter rule applies it to the specified, target subscription or non-MDN node, and thus filters the data during replication from the source table to the target table.

See [Table Filters](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/13_table_filters/#table_filters) for additional information on table filters.

Before enabling a filter rule, it must have been defined in the source publication in one of several possible ways:

**For SMR:**

-   The table filter was defined in the publication of the primary database when it was initially created either by the createpub command (see [Creating a Publication](14_creating_publication_cli/#creating_publication_cli)) or by the xDB Replication Console (see [Adding a Publication](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/03_adding_publication/#adding_publication)).
-   The table filter was added to an existing publication using the addfilter command (see [Adding Table Filters to a Publication](20_adding_tablefilters_to_publication/#adding_tablefilters_to_publication)) or by the xDB Replication Console (see [Updating the Set of Available Table Filters in a Publication](../../07_common_operations/06_managing_publication/04_updating_table_filters_in_pub/#updating_table_filters_in_pub)).

**For MMR:**

-   The table filter was defined in the publication of the primary definition node when it was initially created either by the createpub command (see [Creating a Publication](14_creating_publication_cli/#creating_publication_cli)) or by the xDB Replication Console (see [Adding a Publication](../../06_mmr_operation/02_creating_publication_mmr/#add_pub_mmr)).
-   The table filter was added to an existing publication using the addfilter command (see [Adding Table Filters to a Publication](20_adding_tablefilters_to_publication/#adding_tablefilters_to_publication)) or by the xDB Replication Console (see [Updating the Set of Available Table Filters in a Publication](../../07_common_operations/06_managing_publication/04_updating_table_filters_in_pub/#updating_table_filters_in_pub)).

Enable the filter rule as follows:

**For SMR:** Use the `enablefilter` command or the xDB Replication Console (see [Enabling/Disabling Table Filters on a Subscription](../../05_smr_operation/05_managing_subscription/04_enable_filters_on_subscription/#enable_filters_on_subscription)).

**For MMR:** Use the `enablefilter` command or the xDB Replication Console (see [Enabling/Disabling Table Filters on a Primary node](../../06_mmr_operation/09_enable_disable_table_filters/#enable_disable_table_filters).

Once a filter rule has been enabled, it filters the data during replication from the source table to the target table. A filter rule can subsequently be disabled so that it no longer filters the data during replication to the target table (see [Disabling Filters on a Subscription or Non-MDN Node](39_disable_filters_on_subscription_or_non_pdn_node/#disable_filters_on_subscription_or_non_pdn_node)).

Parameters

`pubsvrfile`

> The file containing the publication server login information.

`subname`

> **For SMR only:** The name of the subscription containing the tables on which the filter rules are to be enabled.

`dbid`

> **For MMR only:** The publication database ID of the non-MDN node containing the tables on which the filter rules are to be enabled.

`filterid_n`

> One or more filter IDs separated by space characters identifying the filter rules from the set of available table filters to enable on the corresponding tables in the SMR subscription specified by subname or in the MMR non-MDN node specified by `dbid`. Use the `printpubfilterslist` command to obtain the filter IDs for the available filter rules in the publication (see [Printing a List of Filters in a Publication](17_print_publications_filters_list/#print_publications_filters_list)).

Examples

In the following example, a filter rule is enabled on a subscription of a single-master replication system.

```text
$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -enablefilter -repsvrfile ~/pubsvrfile.prop \
>   -subname analysts_managers_sub \
>   -filterids 47
Enabling filters...
Filter rule(s) updated successfully.
```

In the following example, multiple filter rules are enabled on a primary node that is not the primary definition node of a multi-master replication system.

```text
$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -enablefilter -repsvrfile ~/pubsvrfile.prop \
>   -dbid 139 \
>   -filterids 8 16
Enabling filters...
Filter rule(s) updated successfully.
```
