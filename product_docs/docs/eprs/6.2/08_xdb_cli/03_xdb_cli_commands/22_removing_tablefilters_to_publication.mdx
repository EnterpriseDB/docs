title: "Removing a Table Filter from a Publication (removefilter)"
---

<div id="removing_tablefilters_to_publication" class="registered_link"></div>

The `removefilter` command deletes the table filter from the specified publication.

Synopsis

```text
-removefilter pubname
  â€“repsvrfile pubsvrfile
  -filterid filterid
```

The removed filter rule no longer applies to any target subscriptions or non-PDN nodes on which the filter rule had been enabled.

See [Table Filters](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/13_table_filters/#table_filters) for additional information on table filters.

Parameters

`pubname`

> The name of the publication containing the filter rule to be removed.

`pubsvrfile`

> The file containing the publication server login information.

`filterid`

> Filter ID identifying the filter rule to be deleted. Use the `printpubfilterslist` command to obtain the filter IDs for the filter rules in the publication (see [Printing a List of Filters in a Publication](17_print_publications_filters_list/#print_publications_filters_list)).

Examples

In the following example, the filter rule with filter `ID 26` is removed from publication `analysts_managers`.

```text
$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -removefilter analysts_managers \
>   -repsvrfile ~/pubsvrfile.prop \
>   -filterid 26
Removing Filter

```
