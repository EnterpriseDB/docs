title: "Adding Table Filters to a Publication (addfilter)"
---

<div id="adding_tablefilters_to_publication" class="registered_link"></div>

The `addfilter` command adds the definition of table filter rules to the specified publication.

This makes the filter rules available for subsequent enablement on target subscriptions or non-PDN nodes.

Enabling a filter rule on a specified, target subscription or non-PDN node results in the filtering of data during replication from the source table to the target table.

If the filter rule is not enabled on a target subscription or non-PDN node, then it has no impact during replication on such subscription or non-PDN node. See [Enabling Filters on a Subscription or Non-PDN Node](38_enable_filters_on_subscription_or_non_pdn_node/#enable_filters_on_subscription_or_non_pdn_node) for information on enabling table filter rules.

See [Table Filters](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/13_table_filters/#table_filters) for additional information on table filters.

!!! Note
    The schema names and table or view names that you supply as values for the tables or views parameters are case-sensitive. Unless quoted identifiers were used to build the database objects, Oracle names must be entered using uppercase letters (for example, `EDB.DEPT`), and Advanced Server names must be entered in lowercase letters (for example `edb.dept`). See [Quoted Identifiers and Default Case Translation](../../10_appendix/04_miscellaneous_xdb_processing_topics/05_quoted_identifiers/#quoted_identifiers) for additional information on quoted identifiers and case translation.

Parameters

`pubname`

> The name of the publication in which table filters are to be added.

`pubsvrfile`

> The file containing the publication server login information.

`schema_tn`

> The name of the schema containing the nth table of the tables parameter list. This value is case-sensitive.

`table_n`

> The name of the nth table in the tables parameter list. This value is case-sensitive.

`schema_vn`

> **For SMR only:** The name of the schema containing the nth view of the views parameter list. This value is case-sensitive.

`view_n`

> **For SMR only:** The name of the nth view in the views parameter list. This value is case-sensitive.

`ordinal_tn`

> The ordinal number (that is, the position in the list counting from left to right starting with 1) of a table in the tables parameter list to which an attribute is to be applied.

`filtername_tn`

> The filter name to be assigned to the filter rule on the table.

`filterclause_tn`

> The filter clause to be applied to the table in the tables parameter list at the position indicated by ordinal_tn.

`ordinal_vn`

> **For SMR only:** The ordinal number (that is, the position in the list counting from left to right starting with 1) of a view in the views parameter list to which an attribute is to be applied.

`filtername_vn`

> The filter name to be assigned to the filter rule on the view.

`filterclause_vn`

> **For SMR only:** The filter clause to be applied to the view in the views parameter list at the position indicated by `ordinal_vn`.

Examples

In the following example, a table filter is added to table `edb.emp` in publication `analysts_managers`.

```text
$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -addfilter analysts_managers \
>   -repsvrfile ~/pubsvrfile.prop \
>   -tables edb.emp \
>   -tablesfilterclause "1:jobgrade_9:job = 'SALESMAN'"
Creating Filter(s)
Tables:[[edb.emp, TABLE]]
Filter clause:[FilterName:jobgrade_9    FilterClause:job = 'SALESMAN'   ]
Filter(s) created successfully.
```
