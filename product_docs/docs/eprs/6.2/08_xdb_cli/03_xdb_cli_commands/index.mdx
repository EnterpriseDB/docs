<div id="xdb_cli_commands" class="registered_link"></div>


This section provides a description, syntax diagram, and examples of each xDB Replication Server CLI command.

Commands are presented in the order in which they will typically be used, following the order in which xDB Replication Console operations are performed.

Though most commands described in this section apply to both single-master and multi-master replication systems, those commands that apply only to single-master replication systems are noted with For SMR only. Those commands that apply only to multi-master replication systems are noted with For MMR only. The same notation is used for command parameters that may apply only to single-master replication systems or multi-master replication systems.

For the examples used in this section, it is assumed that the xDB Replication Server CLI commands are executed after you have made `XDB_HOME/bin` your current working directory, thereby eliminating the need to specify the full path of `XDB_HOME/bin` for each execution of the `edb-repcli.jar` file. For example, assuming xDB Replication Server is installed in the default installation directory you have issued the following command in Linux:

`cd /opt/PostgreSQL/EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer/bin`

In Windows, the equivalent is the following:

`cd C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer\bin`

Whenever the `repsvrfile` parameter appears in the examples, `file ~/pubsvrfile` contains the publication server login information and is located in the userâ€™s home directory while `~/subsvrfile` contains the subscription server login information. For Windows, the equivalent usage is `%HOMEPATH%\pubsvrfile and %HOMEPATH%\subsvrfile.`

The examples in this section were run on Linux so you will see use of the Linux continuation character, which is a backslash (), to show how an xDB Replication Server CLI command can be continued onto the next line if you do not want to wrap the text in your terminal window. For Windows, use the Windows continuation character, which is a caret (`^`).
