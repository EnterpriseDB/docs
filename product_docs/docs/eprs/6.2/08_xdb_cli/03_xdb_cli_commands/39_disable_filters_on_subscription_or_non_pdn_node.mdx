title: "Disabling Filters on a Subscription or Non-MDN Node (disablefilter)"

<div id="disable_filters_on_subscription_or_non_pdn_node" class="registered_link"></div>

The `disablefilter` command disables one or more filter rules on a single-master replication system subscription or on a multi-master replication system primary node other than the primary definition node.

Synopsis

```text
-disablefilter
  -repsvrfile pubsvrfile
{ -subname subname | -dbid dbid }
  -filterids filterid_1 [ filterid_2 ] ...
```

Disabling a filter rule prevents it from being applied to the specified, target subscription or non-mdn node, and thus does not filter the data during replication from the source table to the target table.

See [Table Filters](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/13_table_filters/#table_filters) for additional information on table filters.

Disable the filter rule as follows:

**For SMR:** Use the `disablefilter` command or the xDB Replication Console (see [Enabling/Disabling Table Filters on a Subscription](../../05_smr_operation/05_managing_subscription/04_enable_filters_on_subscription/#enable_filters_on_subscription)).

**For MMR:** Use the disablefilter command or the xDB Replication Console. (see [Enabling/Disabling Table Filters on a Primary node](../../06_mmr_operation/09_enable_disable_table_filters/#enable_disable_table_filters)).

Disabling a filter rule does not remove its definition from the publication. Thus, the filter rule still exists and can still be enabled on target subscriptions or non-PDN nodes.

To remove a filter rule so that it no longer exists, perform the following: For either SMR or MMR: Use the `removefilter` command (see [Removing a Table Filter from a Publication](22_removing_tablefilters_to_publication/#removing_tablefilters_to_publication)) or the xDB Replication Console (see [Updating the Set of Available Table Filters in a Publication](../../07_common_operations/06_managing_publication/04_updating_table_filters_in_pub/#updating_table_filters_in_pub)).

Parameters

`pubsvrfile`

The file containing the publication server login information.

`subname`

> **For SMR only:** The name of the subscription containing the tables on which the filter rules are to be disabled.

`dbid`

> **For MMR only:** The publication database ID of the non-PDN node containing the tables on which the filter rules are to be disabled.

`filterid_n`

> One or more filter IDs separated by space characters identifying the currently enabled table filters that are to be disabled in the SMR subscription specified by subname or in the MMR non-mdn node specified by dbid.

Examples

In the following example, a filter rule is disabled on a subscription of a single-master replication system.

```text
$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -disablefilter -repsvrfile ~/pubsvrfile.prop \
>   -subname analysts_managers_sub \
>   -filterids 47
Disabling filters...
Filter rule(s) updated successfully.
```

In the following example, multiple filter rules are disabled on a primary node that is not the primary definition node of a multi-master replication system.

```text
$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -disablefilter -repsvrfile ~/pubsvrfile.prop \
>   -dbid 139 \
>   -filterids 8 16
Disabling filters...
Filter rule(s) updated successfully.
```
