title: "Configuring a Multi-Master Schedule (confschedulemmr)"

<div id="configure_mmr_schedule" class="registered_link"></div>

**For MMR only:** The `confschedulemmr` command creates a schedule as to when recurring replications are to be initiated for a multi-master replication system.

!!! Note
    Be sure an initial snapshot replication has been performed from the primary definition node to every other primary node in the multi-master replication system. If a newly added primary node did not undergo an initial snapshot, any subsequent synchronization replication initiated by a schedule may fail to apply the transactions to that primary node. The initial snapshot could be taken when the primary node is first added (see [Creating Additional Primary nodes](../../06_mmr_operation/03_creating_primary_nodes/#creating_primary_nodes) or Section [Adding a Publication Database](06_add_pub_database/#add_pub_database)) or by performing an on demand snapshot (see [Performing Snapshot Replication](../../06_mmr_operation/05_on_demand_replication_mmr/#perform_snapshot_replication_mmr) or Section [Take a Multi-Master Snapshot](41_taking_mmr_snapshot/#taking_mmr_snapshot)).

Synopsis

```text
-confschedulemmr pubdbid -pubname pubname
  â€“repsvrfile pubsvrfile
{ -remove |
  { -realtime no_of_sec |
    -daily hour minute |
    -weekly day_of_week hour minute |
    -monthly month day_of_month hour minute |
    -cronexpr "cron_expression"
  }
}
```

If the remove parameter is specified, then the schedule is deleted from the publication. No other parameters other than `pubdbid, pubname`, and `repsvrfile` can be specified in this case.

If the remove parameter is omitted, then one of parameters `realtime, daily, weekly, monthly,` or `cronexpr` must be specified along with the `pubdbid, pubname,` and `repsvrfile` parameters. If there is an existing schedule for publication `pubname`, it will be replaced by the new schedule.

See [Creating a Schedule](../../07_common_operations/02_creating_schedule/#creating_schedule) for additional information on creating a schedule.

Parameters

`pubdbid`

> The publication database ID of the publication database definition representing the primary definition node on which to configure the schedule.

`pubname`

> The name of the publication for which a replication schedule is to be created.

`pubsvrfile`

> The file containing the publication server login information.

`-remove`

> If the remove parameter is specified, then any existing schedule is removed from the publication. If the remove parameter is not specified, then a schedule is created for the publication.

`no_of_sec`

> The number of seconds between scheduled replications. This can be any integer greater than 0.

`hour`

> The hour of the day based on a 24-hour clock. This can be any integer from 0 to 23.

`minute`

> The minute of the hour. This can be any integer from 0 to 59.

`day_of_week`

> The day of the week. This can be any of the following values: SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI, or SAT. This value is case insensitive so Sun and sun will work as well as SUN.

`month`

> The month of the year. This can be any of the following values: `JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV,` or `DEC`. This value is case insensitive so Jan and jan will work as well as `JAN`.

`day_of_month`

> The day of the month. This can be any integer greater than or equal to 1, and less than or equal to the number of days in month.

`cron_expression`

> A cron expression. See appendix [Writing a Cron Expression](../../10_appendix/04_miscellaneous_xdb_processing_topics/03_writing_cron_exp/#writing_cron_exp) for information on writing a cron expression.

Examples

In the following example, a schedule is created to perform synchronization replication on publication `emp_pub` subordinate to the primary definition node whose publication database `ID` is `6`. Replication is to occur daily at 8:00 AM.

```text
$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -confschedulemmr 6 -pubname emp_pub \
>   -repsvrfile ~/pubsvrfile.prop \
>   -daily 8 00
Configuring scheduler ...
Job is successfully scheduled.
```

In the following example, the schedule is removed from publication `emp_pub`.

```text
$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -confschedulemmr 6 -pubname emp_pub \
>   -repsvrfile ~/pubsvrfile.prop \
>   -remove
Configuring scheduler ...
Scheduled job is removed.
```
