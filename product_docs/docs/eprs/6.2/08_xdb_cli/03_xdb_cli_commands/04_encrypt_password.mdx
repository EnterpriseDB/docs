<div id="encrypt_password" class="registered_link"></div>

The `encrypt` command encrypts the text supplied in an input file and writes the encrypted result to a specified output file. Use the `encrypt` command to generate an encrypted password that can be copied into a text file that will be referenced by an xDB Replication Server CLI command that requires a user name and the user’s password.

Synopsis

`-encrypt –input infile –output pwdfile`

The text in `infile` is processed using the MD5 encryption algorithm, and the encrypted text is written to file pwdfile. Make sure that `infile` contains only the text that you want to encrypt and that there are no extraneous characters or empty lines before the text or after the text that you want to encrypt.

Parameters

`infile`

> The file containing the text to be encrypted.

`pwdfile`

> The file containing the encrypted form of the text from infile.

Examples

The file infile contains the word `password`.

`password`

The `encrypt` command is then executed producing a file named pwdfile.

`$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -encrypt -input ~/infile -output ~/pwdfile`

The content of file pwdfile contains the encrypted form of `password`.
