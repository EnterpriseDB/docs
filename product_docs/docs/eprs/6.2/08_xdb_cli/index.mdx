This chapter discusses the syntax and usage of the xDB Replication Server Command Line Interface (CLI). This utility program is a command line driven alternative to the xDB Replication Console.

The steps for creating a replication system using the xDB Replication Server CLI are no different than those required when using the xDB Replication Console. The logical components of the replication system must be created in the same order, with the same sets of attributes as when creating the replication system with the xDB Replication Console.

You should understand the concepts and steps presented in chapters [overview](../02_overview/#overview), and [Single-Master Replication Operation](../05_smr_operation/#smr_operation) (for single-master replication) or [Multi-Master Replication Operation](../06_mmr_operation/#mmr_operation) (for multi-master replication) before building a replication system using the xDB Replication Server CLI. There are no restrictions on using both the xDB Replication Console and the xDB Replication Server CLI to build and manage the same replication system.

In Section [xDB Replication Server CLI Commands](03_xdb_cli_commands/#xdb_cli_commands), the syntax and examples are given for each xDB Replication Server CLI command run individually. Where applicable, the discussion of a command contains a reference back to its xDB Replication Console counterpart where a detailed description of the affected component and its attributes can be found.
