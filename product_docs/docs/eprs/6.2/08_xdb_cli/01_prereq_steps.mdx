This section describes the installation and setup required prior to using the xDB Replication Server CLI.

The xDB Replication Server CLI is included if the xDB Replication Console component is chosen when installing xDB Replication Server. The xDB Replication Server CLI is a Java application found in directory `XDB_HOME/bin`.

**Step 1:** Follow the installation steps given in Chapter [Installation and Uninstallation](../03_installation/#installation) to install xDB Replication Server.

**Step 2:** Follow the prerequisite steps given in Section [Prerequisite Steps](#prerequisite-steps) for single-master replication systems or Section [Prerequisite Steps](../05_smr_operation/01_prerequisites/#prerequisites) for multi-master replication systems.

**Step 3:** Set the Java Runtime Environment as described by the following discussion.

On the host from which you intend to run the xDB Replication Server CLI, the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) must be present and the Java runtime bin directory must be included in the path of the operating system user name that will be used to run xDB Replication Server CLI.

The xDB Startup Configuration file, `xdbReplicationServer-xx.config`, contains the path of the `JRE runtime` program that was detected during the installation of xDB Replication Server. The following is an example of the xDB Startup Configuration file (see [Post-Installation Host Environment](../03_installation/05_post_installation_host_environment/#post_installation_host_environment) for the location of this file.)

```text
#!/bin/sh

JAVA_EXECUTABLE_PATH="/usr/bin/java"
JAVA_MINIMUM_VERSION=1.7
JAVA_BITNESS_REQUIRED=64
JAVA_HEAP_SIZE="-Xms256m -Xmx1536m"
PUBPORT=9051
SUBPORT=9052
```

For example, using the JRE path shown in the preceding configuration file, enter the following on the command line or add it to your profile:

`export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH`

On `Windows systems`, open the `Properties` dialog box of `My Computer`, choose `Advanced System Settings`, and then click on `Environment Variables`. Edit the Path system environment variable to include the `Java Runtime Environment` bin directory. Alternatively, you can set the path for just the current session when you open the Command Prompt window as in the following example:

`SET Path=C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_45\bin;%Path%`
