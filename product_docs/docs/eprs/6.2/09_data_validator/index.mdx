The Data Validator is a utility that compares the rows of one or more tables within a schema of a database against the rows of the tables with the same names within a schema of another database. The Data Validator generates a summary of the comparison noting the number of rows whose column values differ. A file containing detailed information regarding any differences is also generated.

The two databases being compared are referred to as the source database and the target database. The source database can be of type Oracle, EnterpriseDB, SQL Server, Sybase, or MySQL. The target database must be either Oracle or EnterpriseDB.

An EnterpriseDB database type means either an Advanced Server database or a PostgreSQL database.

The tables available for comparison are those found in the schema of the source database. Tables in the target database that do not exist in the source database schema are ignored.

!!! Note
    The Data Validator does not validate columns having the following data types. Tables containing one or more columns of these types will only be partially validated.

-   `BFILE`
-   `STRUCT`
-   `REF`
-   `ARRAY`
-   `BLOB`
-   `CLOB`
-   `RAW`
-   `LONG RAW`

!!! Note
    Regarding the usage of the Data Validator with tables in an xDB Replication Server single-master or multi-master replication system, be sure all synchronization replication between the source and target xDB Replication Server tables has been completed before using the Data Validator. If synchronization replication is still in progress, it is probable that the Data Validator will report differences in table content.
