The following describes the setup of a database user with certain properties enabling you to modify the publication table rows for the purpose of manual conflict resolution.

Manual conflict resolution typically requires modification of rows in one or more publication tables to correct erroneous entries. Such changes can be done using a utility such as PSQL or pgAdmin (Postgres Enterprise Manager Client in Advanced Server).

Manual publication table corrections must usually be isolated – that is, these modifications must be limited to the publication tables you are directly changing and must not be replicated to the other primary nodes as would normally occur in the multi-master replication system.

To prevent replication of changes to a publication table from occurring, the Replication Server insert, update, and delete triggers on the publication tables must be prevented from firing when you make these corrections to the publication table rows. If any of the insert, update, or delete triggers fire, an entry is added to the publication table’s shadow table. This entry results in a transaction replicated to the other primary nodes the next time synchronization replication occurs.

To prevent the triggers on the publication tables from firing, during the session in which you modify the publication table rows, the database server configuration parameter session_replication_role must be set to a value of `replica`. (The default setting of `session_replication_role` is `origin` in which case the triggers will fire.)

The suggested method to ensure the `replica` setting is in effect is to create a database user with a default session setting of `replica` for this parameter. Whenever you connect to a database with this database user, the `replica` setting will be in effect during this session.

Connect to a primary node with this database user whenever you plan to make manual corrections to the publication tables in that particular node that are not to be replicated to the other primary nodes.

In the following example database superuser `MMRmaint` is created and altered for this purpose:

```text
MMRnode_a=# CREATE ROLE MMRmaint WITH LOGIN SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'password';
CREATE ROLE
MMRnode_a=# ALTER ROLE MMRmaint SET session_replication_role TO replica;
ALTER ROLE
```

When connected to a database with this database user, you can confirm this setting is in effect during the session by issuing the following command:

```text
MMRnode_a=# SHOW session_replication_role;
 session_replication_role
--------------------------
 replica
(1 row)
```
