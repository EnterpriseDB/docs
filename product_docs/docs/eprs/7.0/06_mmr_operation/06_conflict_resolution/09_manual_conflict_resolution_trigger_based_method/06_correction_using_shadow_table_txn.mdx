title: "Correction Using Shadow Table Transactions"
---

<div id="correction_using_shadow_table_txn" class="registered_link"></div>

The final method for bringing all publication tables to a consistent state is by removing changes caused by the conflicting transactions and then modifying the publication table’s metadata in such a way that the next synchronization results in the replication of transactions already stored in the shadow tables.

> Such transactions may not have been successfully replicated to all the other primary nodes in a prior synchronization for various reasons.

The following is an example of such a case:

-   Applications on two primary nodes insert rows with the same primary key value. This will result in a uniqueness conflict when synchronization replication occurs.
-   Following the insert on one primary node, the application continues to apply updates to the newly inserted row. These updates are successfully applied to the row on this primary node and are recorded in the shadow table on this node.
-   Synchronization replication is performed.
-   Since there is a uniqueness conflict, the rows with the conflicting primary key value are not replicated into the publication tables on the other primary nodes.
-   However, the conflicting row on the primary node that was not directly updated will receive those update transactions by the replication, resulting in possibly inconsistent, updated rows on the two primary nodes.

Instead of manually inserting the missing row into the other primary nodes and manually changing the incorrect row; or instead of rerunning the application to reapply the correct insert and updates, the following option provides a way to reapply the transactions already recorded in the shadow table of the winning primary node.

The example used to illustrate this method is based upon the following transactions on the `emp` table.

In `MMRnode_b`, the following row is inserted:

```text
INSERT INTO emp (empno,ename,job,deptno) VALUES (9001,'SMITH','ANALYST',20);
```

In `MMRnode_c`, the following row is inserted with the same primary key value 9001 in the `empno` column:

```text
INSERT INTO emp (empno,ename,job,deptno) VALUES (9001,'JONES','SALESMAN',30);
In MMRnode_c, this is followed by a series of updates to the newly inserted row:
UPDATE emp SET mgr = 7698 WHERE empno = 9001;
UPDATE emp SET sal = 9500 WHERE empno = 9001;
UPDATE emp SET comm = 5000 WHERE empno = 9001;
```

Synchronization replication is performed. The resulting content of the `emp` table is as follows:

On `MMRnode_a` the conflicting row has not been replicated:

```text
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM emp;
 empno | ename  |    job    | mgr  |      hiredate      |   sal   |  comm   | deptno

```

In this example, it is assumed that the desired, correct row is on `MMRnode_c`.

The following are the steps to reproduce the correct row, currently on `MMRnode_c`, to the other primary nodes by synchronizing the shadow table entries that resulted from the original insert and updates to this row on `MMRnode_c`.

**Step 1:** Manually delete the inserted row from the publication tables on all primary nodes except for `MMRnode_c`, which has the correct row. Be sure `session_replication_role` is set to `replica`.

On `MMRnode_a`, this row does not exist:

```text
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno = 9001;
 empno | ename | job | mgr | hiredate | sal | comm | deptno
-------+-------+-----+-----+----------+-----+------+--------
(0 rows)
```

On `MMRnode_b`, delete the erroneous row:

```text
MMRnode_a=# SHOW session_replication_role;
 session_replication_role
--------------------------
 replica
(1 row)

MMRnode_b=# DELETE FROM emp WHERE empno = 9001;
DELETE 1
```

On `MMRnode_c`, the correct, accepted row is left intact:

```text
MMRnode_c=# SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno = 9001;
 empno | ename |   job    | mgr  | hiredate |   sal   |  comm   | deptno
-------+-------+----------+------+----------+---------+---------+--------
  9001 | JONES | SALESMAN | 7698 |          | 9500.00 | 5000.00 |     30
(1 row)
```

**Step 2:** On the primary nodes containing the conflicting row that is to be discarded, mark the shadow table entry for that row as discarded. This indicates the conflict on this row has been resolved and ensures this shadow table entry is not replicated in the future.

Change the `rrep_tx_conflict_status` column from `P` (pending) to `D` (discarded) on the losing node, `MMRnode_b`.

**Step 3:** On winning node `MMRnode_c`, inspect the shadow table for the `emp` publication table.

The objective is to use the shadow table entries for the insert and three update transactions that were previously run on this node to replicate to the other primary nodes during the next synchronization.

The leftmost columns of the shadow table appear as follows:

![Shadow table with multiple transactions](../../../images/image155.png)

**Shadow table with multiple transactions**

Make note of the `rrep_sync_id` values for these four entries, which are 1, 2, 3, and 4 in this example.

The following shows the rightmost columns of the shadow table from the prior figure. Note the contents of column `rrep_tx_conflict_status` furthest to the right.

![Shadow table with multiple transactions (continued)](../../../images/image156.png)

**Shadow table with multiple transactions (continued)**

Make sure the `rrep_tx_conflict_status` column is null for these four entries. In this case, for the insert transaction, you will need to change the `P` (pending) value to null.

The resulting change for the `rrep_tx_conflict_status` column in the shadow table on `MMRnode_c` is shown by the following:

![Shadow table transactions set to replicate](../../../images/image157.png)

**Shadow table transactions set to replicate**

**Step 4:** In order to replicate these four shadow table entries during the next synchronization, one or more entries must be added to the control schema table `_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset` on `MMRnode_c` to indicate pending status for synchronization to the target primary nodes (`MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_b`) of the four shadow table entries identified by the rrep_sync_id values of 1, 2, 3, and 4 noted in Step 3.

First, you must identify the `pub_id` and target `db_id` values that are to be associated with the pending transactions. To do so, invoke the following query substituting the `rrep_sync_id` values for `sync_id` in the query:

```text
SELECT pub_id, db_id AS target_db_id
  FROM _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset
  WHERE start_rrep_sync_id <= sync_id
    AND end_rrep_sync_id >= sync_id;
```

In this example, there are four values to be substituted for `sync_id`, which are 1, 2, 3, and 4.

The results are the following:

```text
MMRnode_c=# SELECT pub_id, db_id AS target_db_id
MMRnode_c-#   FROM _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset
MMRnode_c-#   WHERE start_rrep_sync_id <= 1 AND end_rrep_sync_id >= 1;
 pub_id | target_db_id
--------+--------------
      3 |            1
      3 |            4
(2 rows)

MMRnode_c=# SELECT pub_id, db_id AS target_db_id
MMRnode_c-#   FROM _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset
MMRnode_c-#   WHERE start_rrep_sync_id <= 2 AND end_rrep_sync_id >= 2;
 pub_id | target_db_id
--------+--------------
      3 |            1
      3 |            4
(2 rows)

MMRnode_c=# SELECT pub_id, db_id AS target_db_id
MMRnode_c-#   FROM _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset
MMRnode_c-#   WHERE start_rrep_sync_id <= 3 AND end_rrep_sync_id >= 3;
 pub_id | target_db_id
--------+--------------
      3 |            1
      3 |            4
(2 rows)

MMRnode_c=# SELECT pub_id, db_id AS target_db_id
MMRnode_c-#   FROM _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset
MMRnode_c-#   WHERE start_rrep_sync_id <= 4 AND end_rrep_sync_id >= 4;
 pub_id | target_db_id
--------+--------------
      3 |            1
      3 |            4
(2 rows)
```

The results indicate that the previously executed synchronization that attempted to apply the shadow table transactions identified by the `rrep_sync_id` values of 1, 2, 3, and 4 were all for the publication identified by `pub_id` of 3. The target primary nodes were identified by `db_id` of 1 (for `MMRnode_a`) and db_id of 4 (for `MMRnode_b`).

Thus, at least two entries must be inserted into the control schema table `_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset` on `MMRnode_c`. At least one entry is required for the target `db_id` of 1 and at least one entry for the target db_id of 4.

Since each entry in `_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset` consists of a range of `rrep_sync_id` values (identified by columns `start_rrep_sync_id` and `end_rrep_sync_id`) and the desired shadow table `rrep_sync_id` values happen to be contiguous (1 thru 4), a single entry can encompass the four `rrep_sync_id` values for a single target database.

Thus, in this example, a total of two entries can be added to `_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset` – one for each target database.

!!! Note
    If there were multiple, non-contiguous `rrep_sync_id` values required for synchronization (for example, 1, 2, 5, and 6), then multiple entries would be required for each target database. The entries would specify `rrep_sync_id` ranges to collectively cover all of the non-contiguous values, but omitting `rrep_sync_id` values that are not to be included in the synchronization (for example, one entry for 1 through 2 and a second entry for 5 through 6).

**Step 5:** Insert the entries into the `_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset` control schema table as identified in the preceding step.

The two `INSERT` statements invoked on `MMRnode_c` are the following:

```text
INSERT INTO _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset (set_id, pub_id, db_id, status, start_rrep_sync_id, end_rrep_sync_id)
  values (nextval('_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_txset_seq'),3,1,'P',1,4);

INSERT INTO _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset (set_id, pub_id, db_id, status, start_rrep_sync_id, end_rrep_sync_id)
  values (nextval('_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_txset_seq'),3,4,'P',1,4);
```

A query of the \_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset metadata table displays the following:

```text
MMRnode_c=# SELECT set_id, pub_id, db_id AS target_db_id, status,
MMRnode_c-#     start_rrep_sync_id, end_rrep_sync_id
MMRnode_c-#   FROM _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset;
 set_id | pub_id | target_db_id | status | start_rrep_sync_id | end_rrep_sync_id
--------+--------+--------------+--------+--------------------+------------------
      1 |      3 |            1 | C      |                  1 |                4
      1 |      3 |            4 | C      |                  1 |                4
      2 |      3 |            1 | P      |                  1 |                4
      3 |      3 |            4 | P      |                  1 |                4
(4 rows)
```

There are now two new entries with pending status (P), one for target db_id 1, the other for target `db_id` 4. Both entries cover the `rrep_sync_id` range of 1 through 4.

The two entries with completed status (C) are from the synchronization attempt that initially produced the conflict.

**Step 6:** Perform synchronization replication.

The insert and three update transactions recorded in the `rrst_edb_emp` shadow table on `MMRnode_c` are replicated to the other primary nodes.

```text
On MMRnode_a:
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno = 9001;
 empno | ename |   job    | mgr  | hiredate |   sal   |  comm   | deptno
-------+-------+----------+------+----------+---------+---------+--------
  9001 | JONES | SALESMAN | 7698 |          | 9500.00 | 5000.00 |     30
(1 row)
On MMRnode_b:
MMRnode_b=# SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno = 9001;
 empno | ename |   job    | mgr  | hiredate |   sal   |  comm   | deptno
-------+-------+----------+------+----------+---------+---------+--------
  9001 | JONES | SALESMAN | 7698 |          | 9500.00 | 5000.00 |     30
(1 row)
```

These rows now match the row created by the original transactions on MMRnode_c:

```text
MMRnode_c=# SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno = 9001;
 empno | ename |   job    | mgr  | hiredate |   sal   |  comm   | deptno
-------+-------+----------+------+----------+---------+---------+--------
  9001 | JONES | SALESMAN | 7698 |          | 9500.00 | 5000.00 |     30
(1 row)
```

**Step 7:** In the control schema of the publication database currently designated as the controller database, modify the entries in the xdb_conflicts table to indicate the conflict has been resolved as in Step 3 of Section [Manual Publication Table Correction](04_manual_publication_table_correction/#manual_publication_table_correction).

For a uniqueness (insert/insert) conflict only, the following query on the `xdb_conflicts` table in the controller database can display the conflicts:

```text
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts
MMRnode_a-#   WHERE pk_value = 'empno=9001'
MMRnode_a-#     AND conflict_type = 'II'
MMRnode_a-#     AND resolution_status = 'P';

pk_value            | empno=9001
```

The following SQL statement changes the value in column resolution_status from `P (pending)` to `C (completed)` to indicate this conflict has been resolved. The value in winning_db_id is changed to 56 to indicate primary node `MMRnode_c` contains the winning transaction. The value in `winning_rrep_sync_id` is changed to the value of `rrep_sync_id` for the shadow table entry of the INSERT transaction in `MMRnode_c` since this is the one deemed to be correct.

```text
UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts SET
  resolution_status = 'C',
  win_db_id = 56,
  win_rrep_sync_id = 1
WHERE pk_value = 'empno=9001'
  AND conflict_type = 'II'
  AND resolution_status = 'P';
```

When viewed in the Conflict History tab, the entry now shows Resolved in the Resolution Status column, and the Winning DB column shows the address of primary node `MMRnode_c`.
