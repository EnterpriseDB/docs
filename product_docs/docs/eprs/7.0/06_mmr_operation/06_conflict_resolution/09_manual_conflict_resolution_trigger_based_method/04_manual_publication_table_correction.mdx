title: "Manual Publication Table Correction"
---

<div id="manual_publication_table_correction" class="registered_link"></div>

The first step required in all manual conflict resolutions is to ensure all publication tables are consistent across all primary nodes – that is, all corresponding tables have the same rows with the same column values.

Once this state is achieved, you can then reapply transactions that may have failed to replicate successfully.

In the preceding example, the inconsistencies are the following:

-   Primary nodes `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_b` each contain a row with primary key value 50, but the other column values in the row are different.
-   Primary node `MMRnode_c` does not have a row with primary key value 50.

Assuming that the correct state of the dept table should be the one in MMRnode_b, the following options are available to correct the state of all primary nodes:

-   Manually correct the dept table in `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_c`. That is, update the row in `MMRnode_a` so it has the correct values, and insert the missing row in `MMRnode_c`. The dept table on all nodes is now consistent and up-to-date.
-   Manually delete the row with primary key value 50 from the table on both `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_b`. This brings the dept table on all primary nodes back to a prior, consistent state. Then, with the multi-master replication system running, perform the insert transaction again using the correct column values on any one of the primary nodes.
-   Manually delete the incorrect row with primary key value 50 from the table on `MMRnode_a`. Leave the correct row in the table in `MMRnode_b`. This simulates the state where the correct transaction was run on `MMRnode_b`, is recorded in the shadow table, but has not yet been replicated, and the incorrect transaction was never run on `MMRnode_a`. Update the shadow table entry in `MMRnode_a` to indicate that it is discarded and to ensure it is not included in any future synchronizations. Update the metadata for the shadow table entry in `MMRnode_b` to force its inclusion in the next synchronization. Perform a synchronization replication so the accepted shadow table entry in `MMRnode_b` is replicated to `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_c`.

After the publication table rows are corrected, update the appropriate control schema table in the publication database currently designated as the controller database to indicate that the conflict has been resolved.

Each of the methods outlined in the preceding bullet points are described in more detail in the following sections. (The method described by the third bullet point is illustrated using a slightly more complex example on the `emp` table.)

The method outlined by the first bullet point is accomplished as follows.

**Step 1:** Manually correct the rows in the publication tables with `session_replication_role` set to `replica`.

On `MMRnode_a`, correct the erroneous row:

```text
MMRnode_a=# SHOW session_replication_role;
 session_replication_role
--------------------------
 replica
(1 row)


MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | FINANCE    | CHICAGO
(5 rows)


MMRnode_a=# UPDATE dept SET dname = 'MARKETING', loc = 'LOS ANGELES' WHERE deptno = 50;
UPDATE 1
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM dept ORDER BY deptno;
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

On `MMRnode_c`, insert the missing row:

```text
MMRnode_c=# SHOW session_replication_role;
 session_replication_role
--------------------------
 replica
(1 row)


MMRnode_c=# INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50, 'MARKETING', 'LOS ANGELES');
INSERT 0 1
MMRnode_c=# SELECT * FROM dept ORDER BY deptno;
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

The dept table on `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_c` now match the content of the table on `MMRnode_b`:

```text
MMRnode_b=# SELECT * FROM dept ORDER BY deptno;
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

**Step 2:** Update the shadow table entries for the conflicting transactions in the primary nodes to indicate that the conflict has been resolved. In each primary node where a transaction occurred that is involved in the conflict, inspect the shadow table for the publication table in question. Shadow tables are located in each primary node in schema `_edb_replicator_pub`. Shadow tables follow the naming convention `rrst_schema_table` where schema is the name of the schema containing the publication table and table is the name of the publication table.

Note the following points regarding shadow tables:

-   A row in a shadow table corresponds to an `INSERT, UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement that is applied to the corresponding publication tables in the other primary nodes. A shadow table row does not necessarily correspond to the SQL statement issued by the user application. For example, a SQL statement issued by a user application that includes a WHERE clause using a range such as greater than or less than, results in multiple, individual entries in the shadow table for each individual row in the result set of the application’s SQL statement.
-   The primary key of a shadow table is a program generated, positive integer in `column rrep_sync_id`. The `rrep_sync_id` values are unique amongst all shadow tables within a given primary node. Therefore, the `rrep_sync_id` values for conflicting transactions may or may not have the same value across primary nodes as this depends upon how many prior transactions were recorded in the shadow tables of each primary node.
-   A shadow table entry for a transaction involved in a conflict that has not yet been resolved contains a value of P (pending) in column `rrep_tx_conflict_status`. If a transaction is not involved in a conflict, this column is set to null. (The vast majority of shadow table entries should have null in this column.) If a transaction was involved in a conflict that was resolved automatically by the publication server, and this transaction was accepted as being correct, this column contains C (complete/accepted). If a transaction was involved in a conflict that was resolved automatically, and this transaction was deemed incorrect, this column contains D (discarded).

To find the shadow table entries involved in a conflict, use the Conflict History tab or SQL query as described in Section [Finding Conflicts](../10_manual_conflict_resolution_log_based_method/01_finding_conflict/#finding_conflict) and shown by the following output:

```text
-[ RECORD 1 ]-------+----------------------------------------------------------------
conflict_type       | II
table_name          | dept
pk_value            | deptno=50

target_rrep_sync_id | 0
notes               | ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "dept_pk"
                    |   Detail: Key (deptno)=(50) already exists.
-[ RECORD 2 ]-------+----------------------------------------------------------------
conflict_type       | II
table_name          | dept
pk_value            | deptno=50
src_db_host         | 192.168.2.22
src_db_port         | 5444
src_db_name         | MMRnode_b
src_rrep_sync_id    | 1
target_db_host      | 192.168.2.22
target_db_port      | 5444
target_db_name      | MMRnode_a
target_rrep_sync_id | 0
notes               | ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "dept_pk"
                    |   Detail: Key (deptno)=(50) already exists.
```

You can then query the shadow table in the desired primary node on its `rrep_sync_id` value.

The following query is performed on the shadow table for the dept table in `MMRnode_a` on `rrep_sync_id` value 2 obtained from field `src_rrep_sync_id` of RECORD 1 in the preceding output.

```text
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM _edb_replicator_pub.rrst_edb_dept WHERE rrep_sync_id = 2;
-[ RECORD 1 ]-----------+--------------------------
rrep_sync_id            | 2
rrep_common_id          |
rrep_operation_type     | I
rrep_tx_timestamp       | 25-AUG-15 11:39:35.590648
deptno                  | 50
dname                   | FINANCE
loc                     | CHICAGO
rrep_old_deptno         |
rrep_old_dname          |
rrep_old_loc            |
rrep_tx_conflict_status | P
```

A similar query can locate the pending shadow table entry in `MMRnode_b` by querying on the key value obtained from field `src_rep_sync_id: of RECORD 2:`

```text
MMRnode_b=# SELECT * FROM _edb_replicator_pub.rrst_edb_dept WHERE rrep_sync_id = 1;
-[ RECORD 1 ]-----------+--------------------------
rrep_sync_id            | 1
rrep_common_id          |
rrep_operation_type     | I
rrep_tx_timestamp       | 25-AUG-15 11:39:57.980469
deptno                  | 50
dname                   | MARKETING
loc                     | LOS ANGELES
rrep_old_deptno         |
rrep_old_dname          |
rrep_old_loc            |
rrep_tx_conflict_status | P
```

!!! Note
    To be certain no pending transactions are overlooked, you should examine the shadow tables in all primary nodes that may have been involved in the conflict and search for entries where `rrep_tx_conflict_status` is set to `P`.

The following shows the `rrep_tx_conflict_status` column marked `P` (pending) in the Postgres Enterprise Manager Client.

![Shadow table entry with pending conflict](../../../images/image146.png)

**Shadow table entry with pending conflict**

Modify column `rrep_tx_conflict_status` by changing the value to `D` (discarded) to show that the pending conflict has been resolved. A value of D also ensures that the shadow table entry will not be replicated during any future synchronization replications.

Make this change to the shadow tables in both `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_b`.

![Discarded shadow table entry](../../../images/image147.png)

**Discarded shadow table entry**

Be sure to qualify the row with the correct `rrep_sync_id` value if you perform the update using a SQL statement such as in the following:

```text
UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.rrst_edb_dept SET rrep_tx_conflict_status = 'D' WHERE rrep_sync_id = 1;
```

There is no shadow table entry in `MMRnode_c`, since an insert transaction was not performed in that primary node by the application.

**Step 3:** In the control schema of the publication database currently designated as the controller database, modify the entries in the `xdb_conflicts table to indicate the conflict has been resolved. Table xdb_conflicts` is located in schema `_edb_replicator_pub`.

!!! Note
    The entries in table `xdb_conflicts` only affect the data that appears in the Conflict History tab and the SQL query described in Section [Finding Conflicts](../10_manual_conflict_resolution_log_based_method/01_finding_conflict/#finding_conflict). Changing entries in xdb_conflicts has no effect on future replication operations, but provides a way to keep a record of how past conflicts were resolved.

Note the following points regarding the `xdb_conflicts` table:

-   A row in the xdb_conflicts table appears as an entry in the Conflict History tab.
-   The primary key of the xdb_conflicts table is comprised of columns `src_db_id, target_db_id`, `src_rrep_sync_id`, and `target_rrep_sync_id`. Column src_db_id contains a unique identifier for the primary node in which a transaction occurred that results in a conflict when replicated to the primary node identified by target_db_id. `src_rrep_sync_id` is the shadow table identifier of the transaction on the source primary node involved in the conflict while target_rrep_sync_id is the shadow table identifier of the transaction on the target primary node that is involved in the conflict. Note: For uniqueness (insert/insert) conflicts, the `target_rrep_sync_id` value is always set to 0. For a given uniqueness conflict, there are two entries in the xdb_conflicts table. The `src_rrep_sync_id` value in each of the two entries corresponds to the shadow table identifiers – one for the shadow table identifier associated with the source primary node, the other for the shadow table identifier associated with the target primary node.
-   Table `xdb_pub_database` in the control schema associates the database identifiers `src_db_id` and target_db_id with the primary node attributes such as the database name, IP address, and port.
-   Column table_id is the identifier of the publication table on which the conflict occurred. Association of the `table_id` value with the publication table attributes such as its name, schema, and shadow table is found in each primary node in `_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_tables`.
-   For uniqueness (insert/insert) conflicts only, column pk_value contains text indicating the primary key value that resulted in the conflict. The text is formatted as column_name=value. If the primary key is composed of two or more columns, each column and value pair is separated by the keyword AND such as column_1=value_1 AND column_2=value_2. This provides the primary key of the row in the publication table designated by table_id that resulted in the conflict. Note: Only uniqueness (insert/insert) conflicts contain the column_name=value text in the pk_value column. The pk_value column is null for all other conflict types (that is, update/update, delete/update, update/delete, and delete/delete conflicts).
-   Column resolution_status indicates the status of the conflict. Possible values are P (pending) or C (completed – the conflict has been resolved). This status appears in the Resolution Status column of the Conflict History tab.
-   Column win_db_id can be used to record the database identifier of the primary node that contains the `winning` (accepted) transaction. This information appears in the Winning DB column of the Conflict History tab.
-   Column `win_rrep_sync_id` can be used to record the shadow table identifier of the winning transaction.

The following shows the Conflict History tab prior to updating the `xdb_conflicts` table.

**Pending uniqueness conflict**

The conflict entry for synchronization from `MMRnode_a` to `MMRnode_b` can be located in xdb_conflicts with the following query for this example:

```text
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts
MMRnode_a-#   WHERE src_db_id = 1
MMRnode_a-#     AND target_db_id = 4

                    |   Detail: Key (deptno)=(50) already exists.
 pk_value            | deptno=50
```

The conflict entry for synchronization from `MMRnode_b` to `MMRnode_a` can be located in xdb_conflicts with the following query for this example:

```text
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts
MMRnode_a-#   WHERE src_db_id = 4
MMRnode_a-#     AND target_db_id = 1

                   |   Detail: Key (deptno)=(50) already exists.
pk_value            | deptno=50
```

For uniqueness `(insert/insert`) conflicts only, the following query can be used to display both of the preceding entries:

```text
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts
MMRnode_a-#   WHERE pk_value = 'deptno=50'
MMRnode_a-#     AND conflict_type = 'II'

```

These entries appear in the Postgres Enterprise Manager Client as shown by the following:

![Pending conflict in xdb_conflicts](../../../images/image147.png)

**Pending conflict in xdb_conflicts**

Change the value in column resolution_status from P (pending) to C (completed) to indicate this conflict has been resolved. The value in winning_db_id is changed to 4 to indicate primary node `MMRnode_b` contains the winning transaction. The value in `winning_rrep_sync_id` is changed to the value of rrep_sync_id for the shadow table entry of the transaction in `MMRnode_b` since this is the one deemed to be correct.

The SQL statement to perform this update for the `MMRnode_a` to the `MMRnode_b` synchronization conflict is the following:

```text
UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts SET
  resolution_status = 'C',
  win_db_id = 4,
  win_rrep_sync_id = 1
WHERE src_db_id = 1
  AND target_db_id = 4
  AND src_rrep_sync_id = 2
  AND target_rrep_sync_id = 0;
```

The SQL statement to perform this update for the `MMRnode_b` to the `MMRnode_a` synchronization conflict is the following:

```text
UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts SET
  resolution_status = 'C',
  win_db_id = 4,
  win_rrep_sync_id = 1
WHERE src_db_id = 4
  AND target_db_id = 1
  AND src_rrep_sync_id = 1
  AND target_rrep_sync_id = 0;
```

For uniqueness (`insert/insert`) conflicts only, the following SQL statement can be used to update both of the preceding entries simultaneously:

```text
UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts SET
  resolution_status = 'C',
  win_db_id = 4,
  win_rrep_sync_id = 1
WHERE pk_value = 'deptno=50'
  AND conflict_type = 'II'
  AND resolution_status = 'P';
```

The following are the updated xdb_conflicts entries:

![Resolved conflict in xdb_conflicts](../../../images/image149.png)

**Resolved conflict in xdb_conflicts**

When viewed in the Conflict History tab, the entries now show Resolved instead of Pending in the Resolution Status column, and the Winning DB column shows the address of primary node `MMRnode_b`.
