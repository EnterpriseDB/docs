Another method for bringing all the publication tables to a consistent state is by removing any changes caused by the conflicting transactions and then issuing new, corrected transactions at one primary node, which you allow the multi-master replication system to synchronize to all other primary nodes.

Referring back to the uniqueness conflict on the dept table, instead of correcting the erroneous row and inserting the row into the primary node where it is missing as described in Section [Manual Publication Table Correction](04_manual_publication_table_correction_log_based/#manual_publication_table_correction_log_based), you can delete the conflicting rows from all primary nodes, then insert the correct row in one primary node and let the multi-master replication system synchronize the correct row to all primary nodes.

**Step 1:** Manually delete the inserted row from the publication tables in all primary nodes using the transaction block described in Section [Conflict Resolution Concept for the Log-Based Method](02_conflict_resolution_for_log_based/#conflict_resolution_for_log_based).

On `MMRnode_a`, delete the erroneous row with the following transaction block:

```text
BEGIN;
UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_properties SET value = current_timestamp
  WHERE key = 'last_mcr_timestamp';
DELETE FROM edb.dept WHERE deptno = 50;
COMMIT;
This is shown by the following:
MMRnode_a=# BEGIN;
BEGIN
MMRnode_a=# UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_properties SET value = current_timestamp
MMRnode_a-#   WHERE key = 'last_mcr_timestamp';
UPDATE 1
MMRnode_a=# DELETE FROM edb.dept WHERE deptno = 50;
DELETE 1
MMRnode_a=# COMMIT;
COMMIT
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
(4 rows)
```

On `MMRnode_b`, delete the row even though the transaction created the correct result:

```text
MMRnode_b=# BEGIN;
BEGIN
MMRnode_b=# UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_properties SET value = current_timestamp
MMRnode_b-#   WHERE key = 'last_mcr_timestamp';
UPDATE 1
MMRnode_b=# DELETE FROM edb.dept WHERE deptno = 50;
DELETE 1
MMRnode_b=# COMMIT;
COMMIT
MMRnode_b=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
(4 rows)
```

On `MMRnode_c`, no changes are required as the conflicting transaction did not insert a new row into the table on this node:

```text
MMRnode_c=# SET search_path TO edb;
SET
MMRnode_c=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
(4 rows)
```

**Step 2:** Rerun the correct transaction on one primary node with the multi-master replication system running. Do not run this within the transaction block described in Section [Conflict Resolution Concept for the Log-Based Method](02_conflict_resolution_for_log_based/#conflict_resolution_for_log_based) as the objective is to synchronize it to all primary nodes.

For this example, the correct INSERT statement is executed on `MMRnode_a`:

On `MMRnode_a`:

```text
MMRnode_a=# INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50, 'MARKETING', 'LOS ANGELES');
INSERT 0 1
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

**Step 3:** Perform synchronization replication.

The same rows now appear in the publication table on all primary nodes.

On `MMRnode_a`;

```text
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

On `MMRnode_b`;

```text
MMRnode_b=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

On MMRnode_c;

```text
MMRnode_c=# SELECT * FROM dept;
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

**Step 4:** In the control schema of the publication database currently designated as the controller database, modify the entry in the `xdb_conflicts` table to indicate the conflict has been resolved as in Step 2 of Section [Conflict Resolution Concept for the Log-Based Method](02_conflict_resolution_for_log_based/#conflict_resolution_for_log_based).
