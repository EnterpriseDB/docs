!!! Note
    The manual conflict resolution discussion in this section applies only to multi-master replication systems configured with the log-based method of synchronization replication. See [Manual Conflict Resolution for the Trigger-Based Method](../09_manual_conflict_resolution_trigger_based_method/#manual_conflict_resolution_trigger_based_method) for information on manual conflict resolution for multi-master replication systems configured with the trigger-based method of synchronization replication.

As discussed in Section [Conflict Prevention - Uniqueness Case](../05_conflict_prevention_uniquness/#conflict_prevention_uniquness) there is no built-in, automatic conflict resolution strategy for the uniqueness (`insert/insert`) conflict. If a uniqueness conflict occurs, then you must modify rows in the publication tables containing the conflict as well as modify rows in the control schema tables in the primary nodes to resolve the conflict.

Similarly, manual correction must be used for update/delete and delete/update conflicts. In addition, if the conflict resolution option is set to Manual (see [Updating the Conflict Resolution Options](../../08_update_conflict_resolution_options/#update_conflict_resolution_options)) and a conflict occurs, this conflict must also be resolved in a manual fashion.

This section describes the updates you must make to the publication tables and the control schema tables in the primary nodes.

This discussion is divided into the following topics:

-   Finding Conflicts. Locating unresolved conflicts
-   Conflict Resolution Concept for the Log-Based Method. Basic concept on how to run transactions to apply corrections
-   Overview of Correction Strategies. Overview of the methods you can use to perform the corrections
-   Manual Publication Table Correction. Manual correction of the publication tables
-   Correction Using New Transactions. Using new transactions to bring all primary nodes to a consistent state

The following sections describe these topics in detail.
