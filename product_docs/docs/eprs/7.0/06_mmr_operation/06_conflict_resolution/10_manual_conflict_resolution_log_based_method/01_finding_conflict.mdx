Conflicts can be found using the `Conflict History` tab as described in Section [Viewing Conflict History](../../07_view_conflict_history/#view_conflict_history). The following is an example of the Conflict History tab. Click the `Refresh` button to reveal all of the latest conflicts.

**Figure 6-49: Conflict History tab for log-based method**

!!! Note
    The `View Data link and Conflict Details` window displayed for multi-master replication systems configured with the trigger-based method of synchronization replication are not available for multi-master replication systems configured with the log-based method of synchronization replication.

The `Source DB` and `Target DB` columns provide the IP address and database names of the source and target primary nodes involved in the conflict.

You can also obtain this information from a SQL query rather than from the xDB Replication Console graphical user interface. The following query can be run from a primary node to display information regarding pending (unresolved) conflicts:

```text
SELECT DISTINCT
  conflict_type,
  t.table_name,
  pk_value,
  d1.db_host AS src_db_host,
  d1.db_port AS src_db_port,
  d1.db_name AS src_db_name,
  src_rrep_sync_id,
  d2.db_host AS target_db_host,
  d2.db_port AS target_db_port,
  d2.db_name AS target_db_name,
  target_rrep_sync_id,
  c.notes
FROM _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts c
  JOIN _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_pub_database d1 ON c.src_db_id = d1.pub_db_id
  JOIN _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_pub_database d2 ON c.target_db_id = d2.pub_db_id
  JOIN _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_tables t ON c.table_id = t.table_id
WHERE resolution_status = 'P'
ORDER BY t.table_name;
```

Example output from the query is shown by the following:

```
