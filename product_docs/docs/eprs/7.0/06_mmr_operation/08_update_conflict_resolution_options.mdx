A current conflict resolution option on a publication table can be changed. See Section [Conflict Resolution](06_conflict_resolution/#conflict_resolution) for information on conflict resolution.

**Step 1:** Make sure the publication server whose node is the parent of the publication you wish to change is running and has been registered in the EPRS Replication Console you are using. See Section [Registering a Publication Server](../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) for directions on starting and registering a publication server.

**Step 2:** Select the Publication node under the Publication Database node representing the primary definition node.

**Step 3:** Open the `Conflict Resolution Options` dialog box in any of the following ways:

-   From the `Publication` menu, choose `Update Publication`, then `Conflict Resolution Options`.
-   Click the secondary mouse button on the `Publication` node, choose `Update Publication`, and then choose `Conflict Resolution Options`.

**Step 4:** For each table, you can select the primary conflict resolution strategy and a standby strategy by clicking the master mouse button over the appropriate box to expose a drop-down list of choices.
