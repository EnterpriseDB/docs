<div id="view_conflict_history" class="registered_link"></div>

Conflict history shows the following types of events that occurred during synchronization replication:

-   Uniqueness conflicts where two or more primary nodes attempted to insert a row with the same primary key value or unique column value
-   Update/update conflicts where two or more primary nodes attempted to update the same column of the same row
-   Update/delete and delete/update conflicts where one primary node attempted to update a row that was deleted by another primary node

See [Conflict resolution](06_conflict_resolution/#conflict_resolution) for more information on conflict resolution.

!!! Note
    You can view the conflict history from the Publication node under any primary node in the multi-primary replication system. The history shows conflicts on all publication tables of all primary nodes that occurred during synchronization. Thus the history appears the same regardless of the primary node under which you view it.

!!! Note
    For uniqueness (insert/insert) conflicts, the number of entries appearing under the **Conflict History** tab differs when you use the trigger-based method of synchronization replication versus the log-based method. If you use the trigger-based method, a single insert/insert conflict appears as two entries in the conflict history. Each entry differs in that the source and target database fields for the two conflicting primary nodes are interchanged. If the same conflict occurs when you use the log-based method, only one entry appears in the conflict history.

To view the conflict history:

1.  In the Replication Server console, select any Publication node under a Database node representing a primary node. Tabs labeled **General**, **Realtime Monitor**, **Replication History**, and **Conflict History** appear.

1.  Select the **Conflict History** tab. Select **Refresh** to ensure all the conflicts are listed.

1.  Use the **Conflict Display Criteria** list to display only conflicts of the chosen status: pending, resolved, failed, or all.

1.  Select **View Data** to show the details of a particular conflict.

!!! Note
    **View Data** and the Conflict Details window are available only for multi-primary replication systems configured with the trigger-based method of synchronization replication. These elements don't appear for multi-primary replication systems configured with the log-based method of synchronization replication.
