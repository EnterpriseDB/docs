---

<div id="schedule_shadow_table_history_clean" class="registered_link"></div>

The `confcleanupjob` command creates a schedule as to when shadow table history is to be deleted.

Synopsis

```text
-confcleanupjob pubdbid –repsvrfile pubsvrfile
{ -disable | -enable
  { -minutely no_of_minutes |
    -hourly no_of_hours |
    -daily hour |
    -weekly day_of_week hour |
    -cronexpr "cron_expression"
  }
}
```

If the disable parameter is specified, then the schedule is deleted. No other parameters other than `pubdbid` and `pubsvrfile` can be specified in this case. If the disable parameter is omitted, then the enable parameter and one of parameters `minutely, hourly, daily, weekly,` or `cronexpr` must be specified along with the `pubdbid` and `pubsvrfile` parameters.

See [Scheduling Shadow Table History Cleanup](../../07_common_operations/05_managing_history/#schedule_shadow_table_history_cleanup) for additional information on creating a schedule for shadow table history cleanup.
