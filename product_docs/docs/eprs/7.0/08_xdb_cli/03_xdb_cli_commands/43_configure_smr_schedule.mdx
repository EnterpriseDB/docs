**For SMR only:** The `confschedule` command creates a schedule as to when recurring replications are to be initiated for a single-master replication system.

Synopsis

```text
-confschedule subname â€“repsvrfile subsvrfile
{ -remove | -jobtype { s | t }
  { -realtime no_of_sec |
    -daily hour minute |
    -weekly day_of_week hour minute |
    -monthly month day_of_month hour minute |
    -cronexpr "cron_expression"
  }
}
```

If the remove parameter is specified, then the schedule is deleted from the subscription. No other parameters other than `subname` and `repsvrfile` can be specified in this case.

If the remove parameter is omitted, then the `jobtype` parameter and one of parameters `realtime, daily, weekly, monthly`, or `cronexpr` must be specified along with the `subname` and `repsvrfile` parameters. If there is an existing schedule for subscription `subname`, it will be replaced by the new schedule. See [Performing Synchronization Replication](../../05_smr_operation/04_on_demand_replication/02_perform_sync_replication/#perform_sync_replication) for additional information on creating a schedule.

Parameters

`subname`

> The name of the subscription for which a replication schedule is to be created.

`subsvrfile`

> The file containing the subscription server login information.

`-remove`

> If the remove parameter is specified, then any existing schedule is removed from the subscription. If the remove parameter is not specified, then a schedule is created for the subscription.

`-jobtype`

> Specify s if the scheduled replication is to be done by snapshot. Specify t if the scheduled replication is to be done by synchronization. If the associated publication is a snapshot-only publication, then `-jobtype` s must be used.

`no_of_sec`

> The number of seconds between scheduled replications. This can be any integer greater than 0.

`hour`

> The hour of the day based on a 24-hour clock. This can be any integer from 0 to 23.

`minute`

> The minute of the hour. This can be any integer from 0 to 59.

`day_of_week`

> The day of the week. This can be any of the following values: `SUN, MON, TUE, WED, THU, FRI`, or `SAT`. This value is case insensitive so Sun and sun will work as well as SUN.

`month`

> The month of the year. This can be any of the following values: `JAN, FEB, MAR, APR, MAY, JUN, JUL, AUG, SEP, OCT, NOV,` or `DEC`. This value is case insensitive so Jan and jan will work as well as `JAN`.

`day_of_month`

> The day of the month. This can be any integer greater than or equal to 1, and less than or equal to the number of days in month.

`cron_expression`

> A cron expression. See appendix Section [Writing a Cron Expression](../../10_appendix/04_miscellaneous_xdb_processing_topics/03_writing_cron_exp/#writing_cron_exp) for information on writing a cron expression.

Examples

In the following example, a schedule is created to perform synchronization replication on subscription `dept_emp_sub` once every 5 minutes.

```text
$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -confschedule dept_emp_sub \
>   -repsvrfile ~/subsvrfile.prop \
>   -jobtype t \
>   -realtime 300
Configuring scheduler ...
Job is successfully scheduled.
```

In the following example, the schedule is removed from subscription `dept_emp_sub.`

```text
$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -confschedule dept_emp_sub \
>   -repsvrfile ~/subsvrfile.prop \
>   -remove
Configuring scheduler ...
Scheduled job is removed.
```
