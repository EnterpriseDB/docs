title: "Updating Table Filters in a Publication (updatefilter)"

<div id="updating_tablefilters_to_publication" class="registered_link"></div>

The `updatefilter` command changes the filter clauses of the specified tables or views.

Synopsis

```text
-updatefilter pubname
  â€“repsvrfile pubsvrfile
  -tablesfilterclause
    "filterid_1:filterclause_1"
  [ "filterid_2:filterclause_2" ] ...
```

The next, subsequent replication to any target subscriptions or non-PDN nodes on which these filter rules had been enabled reflects the changes to the filter clauses.

See [Table Filters](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/13_table_filters/#table_filters) for additional information on table filters.

Parameters

`pubname`

> The name of the publication in which the filter clauses are to be updated.

`pubsvrfile`

> The file containing the publication server login information.

`filterid_n`

> Filter ID identifying the filter rule for which the filter clause is to be changed. Use the `printpubfilterslist` command to obtain the filter IDs for the available filter rules in the publication (see [Printing a List of Filters in a Publication](17_print_publications_filters_list/#print_publications_filters_list)).

`filterclause_n`

> The new filter clause to be used.

Examples

The filter clause with filter `ID 26` in publication `analysts_managers` is modified.

```text
$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -updatefilter analysts_managers \
>   -repsvrfile ~/pubsvrfile.prop \
>   -tablesfilterclause "26:job = 'CLERK'"
Updating Filter(s)
