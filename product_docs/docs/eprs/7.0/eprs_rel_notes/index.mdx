The Replication Server documentation describes the latest version of Replication Server 7.0 including minor releases and patches. The release notes in this section provide information on what was new in each release. For new functionality introduced in a minor or patch release, there are also indicators within the content about what release introduced the feature.

!!! Note
    The 7.0 version is backward compatible with 6.2.x and provides a non-breaking upgrade path for the existing cluster deployments. However, it is strongly recommended to verify it in a staging or nonproduction environment before applying the upgrade in a production environment.

New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Replication Server 7.0 include the following:

| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------- |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New Feature | The Publication and Subscription Server configuration options can be modified and applied without requiring a server restart. The CLI now exposes a new command `reloadconf` to reload the updated configuration values at runtime.    |
| New Feature | Replication Server is enhanced to support replication from EDB Postgres Advanced Server (non-redwood mode) and PostgreSQL to Oracle.                                                                                                   |
| Enhancement | Replication Server is certified to support PostgreSQL v14 and EDB Postgres Advanced Server v14.                                                                                                                                        |
| Enhancement | Table-level parallel data loading significantly improves initial Snapshot data replication time for large size Publication tables. The benchmarks reveal 3X to 30X performance improvement for a given workload and related options.   |
| Enhancement | Row-level Filtering capability is enhanced to allow inclusion/exclusion of data based on a sub-query [1284035].                                                                                                                        |
| Enhancement | The CLI command `addtablesintopub` is enhanced to expose an option to enable row-level filter for the target Subscription (SMR)/Master (MMR) nodes [1321993].                                                                          |
| Enhancement | The CLI commands `createpub` and `addtablesintopub` now support a new option to allow the users to add all the tables to a Publication without requiring individual table identification [1273701].                                    |
| Enhancement | The CLI commands `createpub` and `addtablesintopub` are enhanced to allow the user specify a single custom conflict resolution option applicable for multiple tables [731271].                                                         |
| Enhancement | Table(s) can be added into an existing Publication by skipping schema replication [926058].                                                                                                                                            |
| Enhancement | The Replication GUI displays additional replication stats on the Real-time Monitor tab to monitor the status of the cluster [795247].                                                                                                  |
| Enhancement | Replication of the HASH partition table is now supported from Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server.                                                                                                                                  |
| Enhancement | Incremental replication of CLOB, BLOB, and XMLType is now supported from Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server.                                                                                                                       |
| Enhancement | Support added for replication of JSON data type from PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server to Oracle.                                                                                                                            |
