New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Replication Server 7.0 include the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |

| New Feature | The Publication and Subscription Server configuration options can be modified and applied without requiring a server restart. The CLI now exposes a new command `reloadconf` to reload the updated configuration values at runtime.|
| New Feature | Replication Server is enhanced to support replication from EDB Postgres Advanced Server (non-redwood mode) and PostgreSQL to Oracle.|
| Enhancement | Table-level parallel data loading significantly improves initial Snapshot data replication time for large size Publication tables. The benchmarks reveal 3X to 30X performance improvement for a given workload and related options.|
| Enhancement | Row-level Filtering capability is enhanced to allow inclusion/exclusion of data based on a sub-query [1321993].|
| Enhancement | The Publication and Subscription Server configuration options can be modified and applied without requiring a server restart. The CLI now exposes a new command “reloadconf” to reload the updated configuration values at runtime.|
| Enhancement | The CLI commands `createpub and `addtablesintopub` now support a new option to allow the users to add all the tables to a Publication without requiring individual table identification [1273701].|
| Enhancement | Table(s) can be added into an existing Publication by skipping schema replication [926058].|
| Enhancement | Replication Server is enhanced to support replication from EDB Postgres Advanced Server (non-redwood mode) and PostgreSQL to Oracle.|
| Enhancement | The Replication GUI displays additional replication stats on the Real-time Monitor tab to monitor the status of the cluster [795247].|
| Enhancement | Replication of the HASH partition table is now supported from Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server.|
| Enhancement | Incremental replication of CLOB, BLOB, and XMLType is now supported from Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server.|
| Enhancement | Support added for replication of JSON data type from PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server to Oracle.| 
| Bug Fix     | The CLI reports an error on Publication removal if one or more Subscriptions are associated with the Publication [72194].|
| Bug Fix     | Fixed an issue where the ordinal number greater than 9 in the filter clause  is not handled properly.|
| Bug Fix     | Fixed an issue where the add filter command picked the incorrect table index for the filter clause in the WAL mode.|
| Bug Fix     | Fixed an issue where synchronize failed for an SMR cluster during replication from PostgreSQL to Oracle 12.1 when using the JSON datatype.|
| Bug Fix     | Fixed an issue that caused `addtablesintopub` command failure for a table name with multiple $ characters. [1337401]|
| Bug Fix     | Fixed an issue where the initial snapshot fails when set to True in a WAL-based cluster while adding the third database.|
| Bug Fix     | Fixed an issue where frequent WAL sender timeouts were observed, resulting in a lag in replication [1273404].|
| Bug Fix     | Fixed an issue where PostgreSQL 9.6 publication creation was failing with the error `pg_partitioned_table` does not exist. [72306]|
| Bug Fix     | Fixed an issue where updates are replicated from Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server in SMR but are not captured in the shadow table at Postgres Advanced Server. [72353]|
| Bug Fix     | Fixed an issue where replication fails due to the non-escaped quote character in the control event. [72614]|
| Bug Fix     | Fixed an issue where migration from EDB Postgres Advanced Server to SQL Server fails [schema only mode and data only mode] for UUID data type. [73835]|
