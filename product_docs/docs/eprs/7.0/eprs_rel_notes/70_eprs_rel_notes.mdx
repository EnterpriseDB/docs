The Replication Server documentation describes the latest version of Replication Server 7.0 including minor releases and patches. The release notes in this section provide information on what was new in each release. For new functionality introduced in a minor or patch release, there are also indicators within the content about what release introduced the feature.


New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Replication Server 7.0 include the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Enhancement | Table-level parallel data loading significantly improves initial Snapshot data replication time for large size Publication tables. The benchmarks reveal 3X to 30X performance improvement for a given workload and related options.|
| Enhancement | Row-level Filtering capability is enhanced to allow inclusion/exclusion of data based on a sub-query [1321993].|
| Enhancement | The Publication and Subscription Server configuration options can be modified and applied without requiring a server restart. The CLI now exposes a new command “reloadconf” to reload the updated configuration values at runtime.|
| Enhancement | The CLI commands `createpub and `addtablesintopub` now support a new option to allow the users to add all the tables to a Publication without requiring individual table identification [1273701].|
| Enhancement | Table(s) can be added into an existing Publication by skipping schema replication [926058].|
| Enhancement | Replication Server is enhanced to support replication from EDB Postgres Advanced Server (non-redwood mode) and PostgreSQL to Oracle.|
| Enhancement | The Replication GUI displays additional replication stats on the Real-time Monitor tab to monitor the status of the cluster [795247].|
| Enhancement | Replication of the HASH partition table is now supported from Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server.|
| Enhancement | Incremental replication of CLOB, BLOB and XMLType is now supported from Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server.|
| Enhancement | Support added for replication of JSON data type from PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server to Oracle.| 
| Bug Fix | In a hybrid replication setup where EDB Postgres Advanced Server was registered with no-redwood-compat option (as a controller database in MMR and Oracle was registered as a Publication database in SMR), the Publication removal operation failed to complete. This issue is fixed [72469].|
