This section describes the process of installing Replication Server 7.0 when you have existing single-master or multi-master replication systems that are running under Replication Server version 7.0.

It is assumed that you will be installing Replication Server 7.0 on the same host machine that is currently running Replication Server 6.2.x, and that you will then manage the existing replication systems using Replication Server 7.0.

A direct upgrade is supported only from Replication Server versions 6.2.x.


After upgrading to version 6.2, you can then upgrade to 7.0.

The following sections illustrate the upgrade process from Replication Server 6.2. If you are using a version of Replication Server older than 6.2.x, first upgrade to 6.2.x and then upgrade to version 7.0.
