This section describes the process of installing Replication Server 7.0 when you have existing single-master or multi-master replication systems that are running under Replication Server version 7.0.

It is assumed that you will be installing Replication Server 7.0 on the same host machine that is currently running Replication Server 6.1.x or 6.0.x, and that you will then manage the existing replication systems using Replication Server 6.2.

A direct upgrade is supported only from Replication Server versions 6.1.x or 6.0.x.

If you have Replication Server 5.1.x, you must first upgrade this version to Replication Server 6.0. See Section 10.2 *Upgrading to Replication Server 6.0* in the EDB Replication Server 6.0 Userâ€™s Guide located at:

> <https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/product-documentation>

After upgrading to version 6.0, you can then upgrade to 6.2.

The following sections illustrate the upgrade process from Replication Server 6.1. The same steps apply for upgrading from Replication Server 6.0, but with different version numbers in the file and directory names of the older product.
