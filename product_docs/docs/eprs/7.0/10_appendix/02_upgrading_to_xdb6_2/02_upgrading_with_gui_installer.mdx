Perform the following steps to upgrade to Replication Server 7.0 using the graphical user interface installer.

**Step 1:** Any pending backlog of transactions on the publication tables must be replicated before starting the upgrade process.

**Step 2:** After all pending transactions have been replicated to their target databases, stop the Replication Server 6.1.x publication server and subscription server. See sections [Registering a Publication Server](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) and [Registering a Subscription Server](../../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server).

**Step 3:** Install Replication Server 7.0. See Chapter [Installation and Uninstallation](../../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server) for instructions on installing Replication Server, but note the differences described in the following steps.

**Step 4:** Following the acceptance of the license agreement in Step 11 of Section [Installing With Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus](../../03_installation/01_installing_with_stackbuilder/#installing_with_stackbuilder), the Select Components screen appears, but with the entries grayed out. The old Replication Server components are replaced by the new ones in the old Replication Server’s directory location. Click the `Next` button.

**Step 5:** The Existing Installation screen confirms that an existing Replication Server installation was found. Click the `Next` button to proceed with the upgrade.

**Step 6:** On the `Ready to Install` screen, click the `Next` button.

**Step 7:** The remaining screens that appear confirm completion of the installation process and allow you to exit from Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus.

**Step 8:** After installation completes, the publication server of the new Replication Server product should be running, connected to the controller database used by Replication Server 6.1. The subscription server may or may not be running at this point, however, that is an expected outcome of this process.

**Step 9:** Complete the publication server and subscription server configuration file setup.

In the `XDB_HOME/etc` directory, a new set of configuration files for Replication Server version 7.0 are created. These files are named `xdb_pubserver.conf.new` and `xdb_subserver.conf.new`. The new configuration files contain any new configuration options added for Replication Server 6.2.

The old configuration files used by Replication Server version 6.1.x remain unchanged as `xdb_pubserver.conf` and `xdb_subserver.conf`.

Merge the old and new configuration files so that the resulting, active configuration files contain any new Replication Server 7.0 configuration options as well as any non-default settings you used with the Replication Server 6.2.x and wish to continue to use with Replication Server 7.0. The final set of active configuration files must be named `xdb_pubserver.conf` and `xdb_subserver.conf`.

In the `XDB_HOME/etc/sysconfig` directory, make sure the Replication Server Startup Configuration file `xdbReplicationServer-62.config` contains the parameter settings you wish to use with Replication Server 7.0. See [Replication Server Startup Configuration File](../../02_overview/03_replication_server_components_and_architecture/01_physical_components/#xdb_startup_conf_file) for information on the Replication Server Startup Configuration file.

**Step 10:** Restart the publication server and the subscription server (see sections [Registering a Publication Server](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) and [Registering a Subscription Server](../../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server)).

**Step 11:** Check the publication server and subscription server log files to verify that no errors have occurred (see [Publication and Subscription Server Startup Failures](../03_resolving_problems/02_where_to_look_for_errors/#pub_and_sub_startup_failures)).

**Step 12:** Adjust the publication server and subscription server port numbers if necessary.

The Replication Server 7.0 publication and subscription servers are installed to use the default port numbers `9051` and `9052`, respectively. If the Replication Server 6.1.x replication systems used port numbers other than `9051` and `9052`, then perform the modifications to correct this inconsistency as described in Section [Updating the Publication and Subscription Server Ports](04_updating_sub_and_pub_ports/#updating_sub_and_pub_ports).

If no such adjustment to the port numbers is needed, register the publication server and subscription server with the EPRS Replication Console as described in sections [Registering a Publication Server](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) and [Registering a Subscription Server](../../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server). The existing replication systems should appear in the replication tree of the EPRS Replication Console.

**Step 13:** You are now ready to use Replication Server 7.0 to create new replication systems and manage existing ones.
