A cron expression is a text string used to express a schedule of dates and times. The Linux cron tool uses a cron expression to schedule the execution of a job. xDB Replication Server uses the Quartz job scheduling system for scheduling replications.

When creating a schedule for an xDB Replication Server replication system, a cron expression can be specified. There are a number of formats for cron expressions. You must use the cron expression format supported by Quartz.

The remainder of this section provides an overview of most of the types of cron expressions that can be used for an xDB Replication Server schedule. For a more comprehensive treatment of cron expressions, refer to the Quartz documentation.

A Quartz cron expression consists of six mandatory fields, followed by one optional field. Each field is separated from its neighbors by one or more consecutive space characters. The fields are order dependent and are listed as they must appear below:

`ss mi hr dd mm dow [ yyyy ]`
