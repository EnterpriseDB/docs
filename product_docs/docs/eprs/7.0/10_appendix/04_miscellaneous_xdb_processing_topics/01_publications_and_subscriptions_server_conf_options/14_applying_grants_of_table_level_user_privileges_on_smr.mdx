!!! Note
    This option applies to the subscription server only.

!!! Note
    This option applies only when both the publication database and the subscription database are Postgres databases.

When creating a subscription in a single-master replication system, the subscription server creates the subscription tables in the subscription database.

When `skipTablePrivileges` is set to true, which is the default value, no database user privileges are granted on these subscription tables to any database user. By default the subscription database user specified when the subscription database definition is created (see [Adding a Subscription Database](../../../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/02_adding_subscription_database/#adding_subscription_database)) is the owner of the subscription tables.

This is the typical, expected scenario since the data in subscription tables should not be updated by user applications other than the Replication Server.

Database users that require access to the subscription tables must be explicitly granted such privileges.

If however, you do want the subscription server to grant database user privileges to the subscription tables for the same database users that already have access privileges to the publication tables, set `skipTablePrivileges` to false in the subscription server configuration file. (The setting of `skipTablePrivileges` in the publication server configuration file is ignored for this process in a single-master replication system.)

In this case, the same access privileges are granted on the subscription tables to database users with privileges on the publication tables at the time the subscription is defined using the EPRS Replication Console or the Replication Server CLI.

`skipTablePrivileges={true | false}`

The default value is `true.`
