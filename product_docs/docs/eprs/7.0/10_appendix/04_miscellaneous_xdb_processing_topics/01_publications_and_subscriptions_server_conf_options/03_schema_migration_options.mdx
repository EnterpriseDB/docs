!!! Note
    The option described in this section applies to the subscription server only.

The option in this section controls how certain aspects of the publication database schema are migrated to the subscription database.

**skipCheckConst**

By default, column ``CHECK`` constraints from publication tables are migrated to the subscription table definitions when the subscription is created. Set this option to true if you do not want ``CHECK`` constraints as part of the subscription table definitions.

Setting this option to true is useful if the ``CHECK`` constraint is based on a built-in function supported by the publication database server, and this built-in function does not exist in the subscription database server.

> `skipCheckConst={true | false}`

The default value is false.
