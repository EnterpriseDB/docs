<div id="updating_subscription" class="registered_link"></div>

When a subscription is created, certain attributes of the subscribed publication are stored as part of the metadata for the subscription in the control schema. These include the following:

-   The network IP address of the host running the publication server that is the parent of the subscribed publication
-   The port number of the publication server

If the preceding attributes of the publication server change in the replication system environment, then the corresponding subscription metadata must also be changed so the subscription server can communicate with the correct publication server.

The following directions show how to update the publication server network IP address and port number within the subscription server’s metadata.

**Step 1:** Make sure the subscription server whose node is the parent of the subscription you wish to change is running and has been registered in the EPRS Replication Console you are using. See [Registering a Subscription Server](../03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server) for directions on starting and registering a subscription server.

**Step 2:** Select the Subscription node whose attributes you wish to update.

**Step 3:** From the `Subscription` menu, choose `Update` Subscription. Alternatively, click the secondary mouse button on the Subscription node and choose Update Subscription. The `Update Subscription` dialog box appears.

**Step 4:** If the publication server now runs on a host with a different IP address or port number than what is shown in the dialog box, enter the correct information. You must also enter the admin user name and password saved in the EPRS Replication Configuration file that resides on the host on which the publication server is running. Click the `Update` button.

**Step 5:** If Subscription Updated Successfully appears, click the `OK` button, otherwise investigate the error and make the necessary corrections.

**Step 6:** If the publication server with the new network location manages publications subscribed to by other subscriptions, repeat steps 1 through 5 for these other subscriptions.
