After a subscription is removed, replication can no longer occur for the publication that was associated with it until the publication is subscribed to with a new subscription.

Removing a subscription does not delete the subscription tables in the subscription database. It removes the identity and association of these tables to Replication Server so the tables remain in the database until the DBA deletes them with `DROP TABLE SQL` statements.

**Step 1:** Make sure the subscription server whose node is the parent of the subscription you wish to remove is running and has been registered in the EPRS Replication Console you are using. See [Registering a Subscription Server](../03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server) for directions on starting and registering a subscription server.

**Step 2:** Select the Subscription node of the subscription that you wish to remove.

**Step 3:** Remove the subscription in any of the following ways:

-   Choose `Remove Subscription` from the `Subscription` menu.
-   Click the secondary mouse button on the Subscription node and choose `Remove Subscription`.
-   Click the primary mouse button on the `Remove Subscription` icon.
