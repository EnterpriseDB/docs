After the first snapshot replication, subsequent replications can be performed using synchronization replication if the publication was not created as a snapshot-only publication.

**Step 1:** When the trigger-based method of synchronization replication is in use, select the Subscription node of the subscription for which you wish to perform synchronization replication.

When the log-based method of synchronization replication is in use, select the Subscription node of any subscription. For the log-based method, the synchronization replication will be performed on all subscriptions regardless of which one is selected.

**Step 2:** Open the `Synchronize` dialog box in any of the following ways:

-   From the `Subscription` menu, choose `Synchronize`.
-   Click the secondary mouse button on the Subscription node and choose Synchronize.
-   Click the primary mouse button on the `Synchronize` icon.

**Step 4:** `Subscription Synchronized Successfully` appears if the synchronization was successful. Click the `OK` button. If the synchronization was not successful, scroll through the messages in the Synchronize dialog box window.

The operations that were applied to the subscription tables can be seen in the replication history. See [Viewing Replication History](../../07_common_operations/04_view_replication_history/#view_replication_history) for information on how to view replication history.
