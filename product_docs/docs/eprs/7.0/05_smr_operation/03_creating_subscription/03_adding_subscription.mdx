Subordinate to a subscription database definition, you create subscriptions. A subscription assigns the publication to replicate to the database identified by the subscription database definition.

**Step 1:** Select the Subscription Database node. Select **Subscription > Create Subscription**. 

**Step 2:** In the Create Subscription dialog box, fill in the following fields:

-   **Subscription Name**. Enter a name for the subscription that is unique among all subscription names.
-   **Host**. Network IP address of the publication server that is the parent node of the publication to subscribe to. This  IP address is the same value entered in the **Host** field in Step 3 of [Registering a publication server](../02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server).
-   **Port**. Port used by the publication server. This is the same value entered in the **Port** field in Step 3 of [Registering a publication server](../02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server).
-   **User Name**. Admin user name of the publication server. This is the same value entered in the **User Name** field in Step 3 of [Registering a publication server](../02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server).
-   **Password**. Password of the admin user. This is the same value entered in the **Password** field in Step 3 of [Registering a publication server](../02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server).
-   **Publication Name**. Select **Load** to get a list of available publications. Select the publication to  subscribe to.

**Step 3 (Optional):** If you defined a set of available table filters for the publication, you have the option of enabling these filters on this subscription. See [Adding a publication](../02_creating_publication/03_adding_publication/#adding_publication) for instructions on defining table filters. 

Select the **Filter Rules** tab to enable one or more filter rules on the subscription. You can enable at most one filter rule on any given subscription table.

**Step 4:** Select **Create**. When Subscription Created Successfully appears, select **OK**.

A Subscription node is added to the replication tree.

The tables and views from the publication are created in the subscription database but without any rows. Rows are populated into the subscription tables when the first snapshot replication occurs.
