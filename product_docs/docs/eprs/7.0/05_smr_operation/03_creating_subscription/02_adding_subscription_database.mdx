You must identify to Replication Server the database for subscriptions. You do this buy creating a subscription database definition.

After you create the subscription database definition, a Subscription Database node representing that subscription database definition appears in the replication tree of the Replication Server console. Subscriptions created subordinate to this subscription database definition have their publications replicated to the database identified by the subscription database definition.

You must enter database connection information such as the database server network address, database identifier, and database login user name and password when you create the subscription database definition. The subscription server uses the connection information to create the subscription table definitions. The publication server uses this information to perform replications.

Note the following restriction on the subscription database:

-   **For Oracle only.** There must be no existing tables or views owned by the Oracle subscription database user that has the same name as a table or view in a publication replicated to this database. For example, if the Oracle subscription database user name is `subuser`, and if a Postgres publication contains a table with the name `dept`, then the Oracle subscription database must not have an existing table or view with the schema-qualified name `subuser.dept` when you create the subscription.
-   **For Postgres only.** There must be no existing tables or views with the same schema-qualified name as a table or view in a publication replicated to this database. For example, if the publication contains a table with the schema-qualified name `edb.dept`, then the Postgres subscription database must not have an existing table or view with the schema-qualified name `edb.dept` when you create the subscription.

!!! Note
    If the SQL Server publication schema name is `dbo`, the subscription tables are created under a schema named `dbo_sql` in Postgres.

-   **For SQL Server only.** There must be no existing tables or views with the same schema-qualified name as a table or view in a publication replicated to this database. For example, if the publication contains a table with the schema-qualified name `edb.dept`, then the SQL Server subscription database must not have an existing table or view with the schema-qualified name `edb.dept` when you create the subscription.

!!! Note
    If the Postgres publication schema name is `public`, the subscription tables are created under a schema named `public_sql` in SQL Server.

!!! Note
    You can use a database added as a publication database as a subscription database.

**Step 1:** Make sure the database server where the subscription database resides is running and accepting client connections.

**Step 2:** Select the Subscription Server node. Select **Subscription > Subscription Database > Add Database**.

**Step 3:** In the Subscription Service – Add Database dialog box, fill in the following fields:

-   **Database Type**. Select **Oracle**, **SQL Server**, **PostgreSQL**, or **Postgres Plus Advanced Server** for the type of subscription database. For an EDB Postgres Advanced Server Oracle-compatible installation, select the **Postgres Plus Advanced Server** option. For PostgreSQL or an EDB Progres Advanced Server PostgreSQL-compatible installation, select the **PostgreSQL** option.
-   **Host**. IP address of the host where the subscription database server is running.
-   **Port**. Port on which the subscription database server is listening for connections.
-   **User**. The subscription database user name:
    -  Selected in [Postgres subscription database](../01_prerequisites/05_preparing_sub_database/#postgres_sub_database) for a Postgres subscription database 
    -  Created in Step 2 of [Oracle subscription database](../01_prerequisites/05_preparing_sub_database/#oracle_sub_database) for an Oracle subscription database
    -  created in Step 2 of [SQL Server subscription database](../01_prerequisites/05_preparing_sub_database/#sql_sub_database) for a SQL Server subscription database
-   **Password**. Password of the database user.
-   **Service ID (For Oracle)**. Enter the Oracle system identifier (SID) of the Oracle instance running the subscription database if **SID** is selected. Enter the net service name of a connect descriptor as defined in the `TNSNAMES.ORA` file if **Service Name** is selected. Note for Oracle 12c pluggable database): Use the service name.
-   **Database (For Postgres or SQL Server)**. Enter the Postgres or SQL Server database name.
-   **URL Options (For SSL connectivity)**. Enter the URL options to establish SSL connectivity to the subscription database. See [Using secure sockets layer (SSL) connections](../../07_common_operations/11_using_ssl_connections/#using_ssl_connections).

**Step 4:** Select **Test**. When Test Result: Success appears, select **OK**, and then select **Save**.

A Subscription Database node is added to the replication tree under the Subscription Server node.
