This chapter describes how to configure and run Replication Server for single-master replication systems.

For configuration and management of your replication system, the EPRS Replication Console graphical user interface is used to illustrate the steps and examples in this chapter. The same steps can be performed from the operating system command line using the Replication Server Command Line Interface (CLI). The commands of the Replication Server CLI utility are described in Chapter [Replication Server Command Line Interface](../08_xdb_cli/#xdb_cli).
