Existing publications can be updated in the following ways:

-   Tables can be added to the publication
-   Tables can be removed from the publication
-   Filter rules can be updated on publication tables

## Adding Tables to a Publication

For a single-master replication system, you can add tables to a publication, even while there are existing subscriptions associated with the publication. Similarly for a multi-master replication system, you can add tables to a publication while there are additional primary nodes in the replication system.

The following are the steps to add tables to an existing publication.

**Step 1:** Make sure the publication server whose node is the parent of the publication you wish to change is running and has been registered in the EPRS Replication Console you are using. See [Registering a Publication Server](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) for directions on starting and registering a publication server.

**Step 2 (For SMR only):** Select the Publication node of the publication to which you wish to add tables.

**Step 2 (For MMR only):** Select the Publication node under the Publication Database node representing the primary definition node.

**Step 3:** Open the Add Tables dialog box in any of the following ways:

-   From the Publication menu, choose Update Publication, then Add Tables.
-   Click the secondary mouse button on the Publication node, choose Update Publication, and then choose Add Tables.
-   Click the primary mouse button on the Add Publication Tables icon.

**Step 4:** Fill in the following fields in the Add Tables tab of the Add Tables dialog box:

-   Add. Check the boxes next to the table names from the Available Tables list that are to be added to the publication. If the publication is a snapshot-only publication, then views would appear in the Available Tables list as well. The Available Tables list contains only tables and views that are not already members of other publications under the same Publication Database node. Alternatively or in addition, click the `Use Wildcard Selection` button to use wildcard pattern matching for selecting tables to be added to the publication.
-   Select All. Check this box if you want to include all tables and views in the Available Tables list in the publication.
-   Use Wildcard Selection. Click this button to use the wildcard selector to choose tables for the publication. See [Selecting Tables with the Wildcard Selector](../01_select_tables_wildcard_selector/#select_tables_wildcard_selector) for information on the wildcard selector.

If you wish to omit certain rows of the publication tables or views from being replicated follow the directions in the next step to create a filter, otherwise go on to Step 6.

**Step 5 (Optional):** If you want to filter the rows of the publication tables or views, click the Table Filters tab. Define filter rules by entering a unique, descriptive filter name and an appropriate `SQL WHERE` clause in the Filter dialog box to select the rows you want to replicate.

For a single-master replication system, see [Adding a Publication](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/03_adding_publication/#adding_publication) for information on defining table filters on a publication table.

For a multi-master replication system, see [Adding a Publication](../../06_mmr_operation/02_creating_publication_mmr/#add_pub_mmr).

**Step 6 (For SMR only):** Click the `Add Tables` button. If Publication Updated Successfully appears, click the `OK` button, otherwise investigate the error and make the necessary corrections.

**Step 6 (For MMR only):** Click the `Add Tables` button. The `Data Sync Check` dialog box appears warning you that synchronization replication is performed before the table is added.

If you wish to perform synchronization at some later point in time then add the table, click the No button.

If you wish to proceed, click the `Yes` button. If Publication Updated Successfully appears, click the `OK` button, otherwise investigate the error and make the necessary corrections.

**Step 7:** The replication tree appears with the newly added table under the Publication node. Click the `Refresh` icon. The newly added table appears under the Subscription nodes of a single-master replication system or the additional primary nodes of a multi-master replication system.

**Step 8 (For MMR only):** If you want to modify or see the default conflict resolution options assigned to the newly added table, follow the directions in Section [Updating the Conflict Resolution Options](../../06_mmr_operation/08_update_conflict_resolution_options/#update_conflict_resolution_options).

**Step 9 (Optional):** If you defined table filters on the newly added table, and you wish to use these filters on any subscriptions or primary nodes, you must enable the filters on the table within the desired subscriptions or primary nodes.

For a single-master replication system, see <span class="title-ref">Enabling/Disabling Table Filters on a Subscription &lt;enable_filters_on_subscription></span> for directions on enabling table filters on a subscription.

For a multi-master replication system, see [Enabling/Disabling Table Filters on a Primary node](../../06_mmr_operation/09_enable_disable_table_filters/#enable_disable_table_filters) for directions on enabling table filters on a primary node.

## Removing Tables from a Publication

You can remove one or more tables from a publication, but only if the following condition is true:

-   The tables to be removed are not parent tables referenced by foreign key constraints of child tables that are not selected for removal as well.

![Entity relationship diagram of tables with foreign key constraints](../../images/image252.png)

**Entity relationship diagram of tables with foreign key constraints**

In the preceding entity relationship diagram, the `emp` table has a foreign key constraint referencing the dept table, and the `jobhist` table has two foreign key constraints. One constraint references the `emp` table and the other references the `dept` table.

If all three tables are in the publication, then you can remove the following combinations of tables:

-   Remove the `jobhist` table only.
-   Remove both the `jobhist` table and the `emp` table.

**Step 1:** Make sure the publication server whose node is the parent of the publication you wish to change is running and has been registered in the EPRS Replication Console you are using. See [Registering a Publication Server](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) for directions on starting and registering a publication server.

**Step 2 (For SMR only):** Select the Publication node of the publication from which you wish to remove tables.

**Step 2 (For MMR only):** Select the Publication node under the Publication Database node representing the primary definition node.

**Step 3:** Open the `Remove Tables` dialog box in any of the following ways:

-   From the `Publication` menu, choose `Update Publication`, then `Remove Tables`.
-   Click the secondary mouse button on the Publication node, choose `Update Publication`, and then choose `Remove Tables`.
-   Click the primary mouse button on the `Remove Publication Tables` icon.

**Step 4:** Use the `Remove Tables` dialog box as follows:

-   Remove. Check the boxes next to the table names from the Available Tables list that are to be removed from the publication. If the publication is a snapshot-only publication, then views would appear in the Available Tables list as well. Alternatively or in addition, click the `Use Wildcard Selection` button to use wildcard pattern matching for selecting tables to be removed from the publication.
-   Use Wildcard Selection. Click this button to use the wildcard selector to choose tables to remove from the publication. See [Selecting Tables with the Wildcard Selector](../01_select_tables_wildcard_selector/#select_tables_wildcard_selector) for information on the wildcard selector.

**Step 5:** Click the `Remove` button, then click the `Yes` button of the confirmation box.

**Step 6:** Click the `OK` button in response to Tables Removed Successfully.

The replication tree appears without the removed table under the Publication node.
