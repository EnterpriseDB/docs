Once a set of available table filters has been defined in the publication of a single-master replication system or a multi-master replication system, the set can subsequently be updated by adding new filter rules, removing existing filter rules, or modifying existing filter rules.

!!! Note
    See [Table Settings and Restrictions for Table Filters](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/13_table_filters/#table_settings_and_restrictions_for_table_filters) for table setup requirements for a log-based replication system as well as general restrictions on the use of table filters.

See [Adding a Publication](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/03_adding_publication/#adding_publication) for information on using table filters in a single-master replication system and Section [Adding a Publication](../../06_mmr_operation/02_creating_publication_mmr/#add_pub_mmr) for a multi-master replication system. Updating the set of available table filters in a publication has the following implications:

-   After you have added new filter rules to a publication, you must then enable these newly added filter rules on the subscriptions or primary nodes on which you want these filter rules to have an effect. See [Enabling/Disabling Table Filters on a Subscription](../../05_smr_operation/05_managing_subscription/04_enable_filters_on_subscription/#enable_filters_on_subscription) for directions on enabling filter rules on a subscription. See Section [Enabling/Disabling Table Filters on a Primary node](../../06_mmr_operation/09_enable_disable_table_filters/#enable_disable_table_filters) for enabling filter rules on a primary node.
-   After you have removed existing filter rules from a publication, the removed filter rules are automatically deleted from any associated subscription or primary node on which they had been enabled. That is, you do not need to modify the subscriptions or primary nodes to disable the filter rules once they have been removed from the publication.
-   After you have modified existing filter rules (that is, changed the filter name or filter clause), the modifications are automatically applied to any subscriptions or primary nodes on which the filter rules had been enabled. That is, you do not need to make any changes in the associated subscriptions or primary nodes.

After your updates to the set of available table filters in the publication have been completed, and the filter rules have been enabled or disabled on the target subscriptions or primary nodes, a snapshot replication should be performed on any subscription or primary node affected by an updated filter rule to ensure that the content of the targeted subscription tables or primary node tables is consistent with the current set of filter rules enabled on those tables.

The following are the steps to update the set of available filter rules in a publication.

**Step 1:** Make sure the publication server whose node is the parent of the publication you wish to change is running and has been registered in the EPRS Replication Console you are using. See [Registering a Publication Server](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) for directions on starting and registering a publication server.

**Step 2 (For SMR only):** Select the Publication node of the publication in which you wish to update the set of available table filters.

**Step 2 (For MMR only):** Select the Publication node under the Publication Database node representing the primary definition node.

**Step 3:** Open the **Update Filters** dialog box in any of the following ways:

-   From the **Publication** menu, choose **Update Publication**, then **Update Filters**.
-   Click the secondary mouse button on the Publication node, choose **Update Publication**, and then choose **Update Filters**.

**Step 4:** The set of all available filter rules defined in the publication are listed under the **Table Filters** tab.

To add a new filter rule, from the Table/View drop-down list select the table or view for which you wish to add a filter and click the Add Filter button. Fill in the information in the dialog box that appears. (See [Adding a Publication](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/03_adding_publication/#adding_publication) for more details on adding individual filter rules in a single-master replication system. See [Adding a Publication](../../06_mmr_operation/02_creating_publication_mmr/#add_pub_mmr) for a multi-master replication system.)

To remove a filter rule, click the primary mouse button on the filter rule you wish to remove so the entry is highlighted and click the Remove Filter button. You may also modify the filter name or filter clause of a filter rule listed in the Table Filters tab by double-clicking on the cell of the filter name or filter clause you wish to change. When the cursor appears in the cell, enter the text for the desired change.

When you are satisfied with the updated set of available table filters, click the Update button.

**Step 5:** A confirmation box appears presenting a warning message and a recommendation to perform a snapshot replication to any subscription or primary node on which you intend to enable the change in filtering criteria.

Click the **Ok** button in the confirmation box to proceed with the update to the filter rules. Click the **Cancel** button to return to the **Filter Rules** tab if you wish to modify your filter rule updates.

**Step 6:** You may selectively enable any new filter rules to the corresponding tables of the associated subscriptions or primary nodes. See [Enabling/Disabling Table Filters on a Subscription](../../05_smr_operation/05_managing_subscription/04_enable_filters_on_subscription/#enable_filters_on_subscription) for information on enabling table filters on a subscription. See [Enabling/Disabling Table Filters on a Primary node](../../06_mmr_operation/09_enable_disable_table_filters/#enable_disable_table_filters) for enabling table filters on a primary node.
