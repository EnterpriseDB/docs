This chapter describes configuration and maintenance operations of Replication Server that are common to both single-master and multi-master replication systems.

For configuration and management of your replication system, the Replication Console graphical user interface is used to illustrate the steps and examples in this chapter. The same steps can be performed from the operating system command line using the Replication Server Command Line Interface (CLI). The commands of the Replication Server CLI utility are described in Chapter [Replication Server Command Line Interface](../08_xdb_cli/#xdb_cli).

!!! Note
    Though most steps described in this chapter apply to both single-master and multi-master replication systems, those steps that apply only to single-master replication systems are noted with For SMR only. Those steps that apply only to multi-master replication systems are noted with For MMR only.
