On Linux hosts where you installed Replication Server with the graphical user interface or from the command line, you should now have a publication server daemon and a subscription server daemon running on your computer assuming you chose to install the publication server and subscription server components. If you installed the Replication Server RPM package, you must start the publication server and the subscription server based upon the instructions in Section [Registering a Publication Server](../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) for the publication server and [Registering a Subscription Server](../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server) for the subscription server. On Windows systems, the publication server and subscription server run as services named `Publication Service` and `Subscription Service`.

The Postgres application menu contains a new item for the EPRS Replication Console.

!!! Note
    On some Linux systems, you may have to restart the server before you can see the EPRS Replication Console choice in the application menu. If the Replication Console choice is still unavailable in the application menu, it can be started by invoking the script `XDB_HOME/bin/runRepConsole.sh`.

!!! Note
    For Replication Server installed from an Replication Server RPM package, the EPRS Replication Console is started by invoking the script `XDB_HOME/bin/runRepConsole.sh`.

The following files are created that you may need during the configuration process.

!!! Note
    - `XDB_HOME` is the directory where Replication Server is installed. 
    - For Linux, Replication Server is installed in the `/usr/edb/xdb` directory.
    - For Windows, Replication Server is installed in the `C:\Program Files\edb\EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer` directory.

!!! Note
    `POSTGRES_HOME` is the home directory of the postgres operating system account (enterprisedb for Advanced Server installed in Oracle compatible configuration mode).

!!! Note
    The publication and subscription services startup log files (`edb-xdbpubserver.log` and `edb-xdbsubserver.log`) are not generated for Windows and Mac OS X operating systems.

!!! Note
    `USER_HOME` is the home directory of the operating system account in use.

!!! Note
    The Replication Server version number is represented by `x.x` or by `xx` (for example `7.0` or `70`).
