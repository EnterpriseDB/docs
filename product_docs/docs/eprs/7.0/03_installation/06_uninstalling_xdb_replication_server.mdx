Uninstalling Replication Server results in the removal of the publication server, the subscription server, the EPRS Replication Console, the Replication Server Command Line Interface, the EPRS Replication Configuration file, the EPRS Startup Configuration file, the publication server configuration file, and the subscription server configuration file.

Uninstalling Replication Server does not remove any databases used as primary nodes, publication databases, or subscription databases.

Use the EPRS Replication Console or the EPRS Replication Server Command Line Interface to delete any existing single-master or multi-master replication systems before you uninstall Replication Server, otherwise the control schema objects created in the publication databases or primary nodes will remain in those databases. These control schema objects must then be deleted manually such as by using an SQL command line utility.

If you installed Replication Server using the Replication Server installer program invoked from Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus as described in Section [Installing With Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus](01_installing_with_stackbuilder/#installing_with_stackbuilder) or you invoked the Replication Server installer program from the command line as described in Section [Installing from the Command Line](02_installing_from_cli/#installing_from_cli), uninstall Replication Server by invoking the `uninstall-xdbreplicationserver` script as described in this section.

If you installed Replication Server from the RPM package, uninstall it using the Yum package manager. See Section [Uninstalling the EPRS RPM Package](07_uninstalling_xdb_rpm_package/#uninstalling_xdb_rpm_package) for information.
