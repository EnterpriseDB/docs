title: "Installing With Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus"

<div id="installing_with_stackbuilder" class="registered_link"></div>

`Stack Builder` and `StackBuilder Plus` are programs used to download and install add-on products and updates to PostgreSQL and Advanced Server. Stack Builder is used for PostgreSQL. StackBuilder Plus is used for Advanced Server.

Stack Builder and StackBuilder Plus are very similar in functionality and look-and-feel, differing primarily in the list of products offered.

This section demonstrates the installation of Replication Server using StackBuilder Plus for Advanced Server. Steps are noted where the installation process differs for installation on PostgreSQL using Stack Builder.

**Step 1:** You must have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.7 or later installed on the hosts where you intend to install any Replication Server component (EPRS Replication Console, publication server, or subscription server). Any Java product such as Oracle Java or OpenJDK may be used.

Follow the directions for your host operating system to install Java runtime.

**For Windows only:** Be sure the system environment variable, `JAVA_HOME`, is set to the JRE installation directory of the JRE version and bitness (32-bit or 64-bit) you wish to use with the Replication Server. The Replication Server installer for a Windows platform contains both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions. The `JAVA_HOME` setting determines whether the 32-bit or the 64-bit version of Replication Server is installed. (If `JAVA_HOME` is not set, then the first JRE version encountered in the Path system environment variable determines the Replication Server version to be installed.)

!!! Note
    For Advanced Server versions prior to 9.3, a Java runtime is supplied and installed as part of the Advanced Server installation process, however, you must still have pre-installed a separate Java runtime system on your host. The Replication Server installation process does not utilize the Java runtime supplied with Advanced Server.

!!! Note
    After installation of Replication Server has completed, the path to your Java runtime program is stored in the Replication Server Startup Configuration file used by Replication Server. Verify that the path to your Java runtime program set in the Replication Server Startup Configuration file is correct. See [Post-Installation Host Environment](05_post_installation_host_environment/#post_installation_host_environment) for the location of this file.

**Step 2:** From the host’s application menu, open the Postgres menu and choose `Stack Builder` or `StackBuilder Plus`.

**Figure 3-1: Postgres application menu**

**Step 3 (For Linux only):** Depending upon your Linux host, a dialog box or a prompt appears requesting the root account’s password. Enter the root password and click the `OK` button.

**Figure 3-2: Enter root account password**

**Step 4:** The StackBuilder Plus welcome screen appears. Select your `Postgres` installation from the drop-down list and click the `Next` button.

**Figure 3-3: StackBuilder Plus welcome screen**

**Step 5 (For Advanced Server):** Expand the EnterpriseDB Tools node and check the box for Replication Server. Click the Next button.

!!! Note
    Though the following ../images show Replication Server v6.0, use the same process for Replication Server v6.2.

**Step 5 (For PostgreSQL):** Expand the Registration-Required and Trial Products node, and then expand the EnterpriseDB Tools node. Check the box for `Replication Server` under the `EnterpriseDB Tools` list and click the `Next` button.

**Step 6 (For Advanced Server only):** In the `Account Registration` screen, either enter your email address and password for your EnterpriseDB user account if you have one, or click the link in which case you will be directed to the registration page of the EnterpriseDB website where you can create an account. Click the `Next` button.

!!! Note
    (For PostgreSQL only): Proceed to Step 7. If you are using PostgreSQL, account registration occurs later in the process.

**Step 7:** Verify that Replication Server appears in the list of selected packages. Click the `Next` button.

![Selected packages](../images/image33.png)

**Figure 3-8: Selected packages**

An information box appears showing the download progress of the Replication Server package. This may take a few minutes.

**Figure 3-9: Downloading progress**

**Step 8:** When downloading of the Replication Server package completes, the following screen appears that starts the installation of Replication Server. Click the `Next` button.

!!! Note
    You can check the Skip Installation box if you wish to install Replication Server some other time.

**Figure 3-13: License agreement**

**Step 12:** Browse to a directory where you want the Replication Server components installed, or allow it to install the components in the default location shown. Click the `Next` button.

![Installation directory](../images/image39.png)

**Figure 3-14: Installation directory**

**Step 13:** If you do not want a particular Replication Server component installed on this particular host, uncheck the box `Next` to the component name. Click the `Next` button.

If you do not have an EnterpriseDB user account, you will be directed to the registration page of the EnterpriseDB website.

If you already have an EnterpriseDB user account, enter the email address and password for your EnterpriseDB user account as shown in the following screen. Click the `Next` button.

**Step 15:** Enter information for the Replication Server administrator.

!!! Note
    From this point on, it is suggested that you record the values you enter on these screens as they will be needed during the publication and subscription server registration process.

Enter values for the following fields:

-   `Admin User.` The Replication Server administrator user name to authenticate certain usage of the Replication Server such as registering a publication server or a subscription server running on this host. Any alphanumeric string may be entered for the admin user name. The default admin user name is admin.
-   `Admin Password.` Password of your choice for the Replication Server administrator given in the Admin User field.

![Replication Server admin user information](../images/image43.png)

**Figure 3-18: Replication Server admin user information**

The admin user and the admin password (in encrypted form) are saved to the EPRS Replication Configuration file named `/etc/edb-repl.conf (XDB_HOME\etc\edb-repl.conf` on Windows hosts). Click the `Next` button.

**Step 16 (Only if publication server is a selected component):** Enter an available port on which the publication server will run. Default port number is 9051. Click the `Next` button.
