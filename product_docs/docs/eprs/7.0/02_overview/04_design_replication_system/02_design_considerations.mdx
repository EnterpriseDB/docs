Keep the following points in mind when designing a replication system:

-   Multi-master replication is supported only on PostgreSQL databases. In addition, Advanced Server databases must be running in the same compatibility mode – either all Oracle or all PostgreSQL.
-   An Oracle table can be a member of at most one publication if all publications are subordinate to one publication database definition. However, an Oracle table can be a member of multiple publications if each publication is subordinate to a different publication database definition.
-   A Postgres table can be a member of at most one publication.
-   Each non-PostgreSQLnon PostgreSQL/Advanced Server database table used in a publication must have a primary key with the exception of tables in snapshot-only publications, which do not require a primary key. 
-   Each PostgreSQL/Advanced Server database table used in a publication must have identity columns (primary key or unique columns) with the exception of tables in snapshot-only publications, which do not require identity columns. For example,
-   Make sure table definitions are well established before creating publications. Unless the DDL change replication feature is used as described in Section [Replicating DDL Changes](../../07_common_operations/08_replicating_ddl_changes/#replicating_ddl_changes), if a table definition is changed, any publication containing the table along with its associated subscription must be deleted and recreated, otherwise replication may fail. The same applies for the table definitions in a primary definition node and its associated primary nodes. Replication failures can be seen in the replication history.

```text
CREATE TABLE dept_pk (
	deptno NUMERIC(2) PRIMARY KEY,
	dname VARCHAR(14)
	loc VARCHAR(13)
);
```

If a table does not have a primary key, then it should have a column(s) with UNIQUE NOT NULL constraints. For example,

```text
CREATE TABLE dept_uk2 (
	deptno NUMERIC(2),
	dname VARCHAR(14) NOT NULL,
	loc VARCHAR(13) NOT NULL,
	CONSTRAINT dept_uk2_dname_loc_key UNIQUE (dname, loc)
);
```
-   Views can be members of snapshot-only publications. In the subscription database, a view is replicated as a table.
-   A publication may have multiple subscriptions.
-   A subscription can be associated with at most one publication.
-   A database can contain both publications and subscriptions.
-   A given publication server can support only one multi-master replication system. All primary nodes created subordinate to a given publication server are assumed to be part of the same multi-master replication system.
-   A table that is created as a result of a subscription can be used in another publication. Thus, a publication can replicate data to a subscription which in turn, can be used in a publication to replicate to another subscription, thus creating a cascaded replication architecture.
-   There are restrictions on the combinations and configurations of database servers that can be used for a publication and its subscription. See [Advanced Server Compatibility Configuration Modes](../../10_appendix/01_permitted_conf_and_permutations/#adv_server_compatibility_conf_modes) for details on these restrictions.
-   All replication system components must be running in order for replication to occur, or before performing any configuration, operation, or modification in the replication system. (The EPRS Replication Console is used for the configuration and modification of a replication system. The EPRS Replication Console does not need to be running in order for replication to occur.)
-   In general, the order of creation of a replication system is as follows: 
    - Create the required physical databases, database user names, tables, and views to be used in the replication system. 
    - Define the replication system logical components using the EPRS Replication Console or Replication Server CLI. 
    - Perform replication.
-   In general, the order of removal of a single-master replication system is as follows: 
    - Remove the replication system logical components using the EPRS Replication Console or Replication Server CLI starting with the subscriptions (Subscription nodes) and then their parent components (Subscription Database nodes). 
    - Unregister the subscription server if you no longer have any need for it. 
    - Repeat the same process for the publications. 
    - After all replication system logical components have been removed (except for possibly the publication server and subscription server) you can drop any of the physical database objects in Oracle, SQL Server, or Postgres. Do not drop the control schema objects manually, for example by using an SQL command line utility. Doing so may cause the EPRS Replication Console and Replication Server CLI to become inoperable. (See [Deleting the Control Schema and Control Schema Objects](../../10_appendix/03_resolving_problems/04_troubleshooting_areas/#del_control_schema_and%20objects) if this problem occurs.) Deleting the replication system logical components using the EPRS Replication Console or Replication Server CLI automatically drops the control schema objects from the physical database.
-   The order of removal of a multi-master replication system is as follows: 
    - Remove the replication system logical components using the EPRS Replication Console or Replication Server CLI starting with the publication database definitions of the non-PDN nodes. 
    - Remove the publication from under the primary definition node. 
    - Remove the publication database definition of the primary definition node. 
    - After all replication system logical components have been removed (except for possibly the publication server) you can drop any of the physical database objects in Postgres. Do not drop the control schema objects manually, for example by using an SQL command line utility. Doing so may cause the EPRS Replication Console and  Replication Server CLI to become inoperable.
