title: "Offloading Reporting and Business Intelligence Queries"
---

In this use case, users take all or just a subset of data from a production OLTP system and replicate it to another database whose sole purpose is to support reporting queries. This can have multiple benefits:

1.  Reporting loads are removed from the OLTP system, improving transaction processing performance.
2.  Query performance improves as well without being subordinated to transactions on the system.
3.  In Oracle installations, the reporting server duties can be handled by a product like Advanced Server reducing licensing costs for a reporting server.
