<div id="permitted_conf_and_permutations" class="registered_link"></div>

Depending on the database products you're using with Replication Server (Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, or EDB Postgres Advanced Server), along with the compatibility configuration mode if you're using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, certain combinations of a source database server and a target database server aren't permitted for a publication and its associated subscription in a single-master replication system.

Similarly, you can use only certain combinations of database products and EDB Postgres Advanced Server compatibility configuration modes together in a multi-master replication system.

For a single-master replication system, the source refers to the database server of the publication database. The target refers to the database server of the subscription database.

For a multi-master replication system, all of the participating database servers act as both a source and a target for all other participating database servers, so the restrictions pertain to the combinations of database servers and compatibility configuration modes that can be used together in the same multi-master replication system.

!!! Note
    A publication or subscription database can't be shared across SMR and MMR clusters. For example, if `inventory` is registered as a subscription database in an SMR cluster, you can't register it as a publication database in the MMR cluster. While Replication Server might not report an error, such a type of deployment architecture isn't supported.

## EDB Postgres Advanced Server compatibility configuration modes

EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports two compatibility configuration modes of operation:

-   Oracle-compatible configuration mode. Operations are performed using Oracle syntax and semantics for data types, functions, database object creation, and so forth. This mode is useful when your applications are migrated from Oracle or you want your applications built in an Oracle-compatible fashion.
-   PostgreSQL-compatible configuration mode. Operations are performed using native PostgreSQL syntax and semantics. This mode is useful when your applications are migrated from PostgreSQL or you want your applications built in a PostgreSQL-compatible fashion.

For more information on features supported in Oracle compatible configuration mode, see the [Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Guide](../epas/latest/epas_compat_ora_dev_guide/).

Select the compatibility configuration mode when you install EDB Postgees Advanced Server.

## Permitted SMR source and target configurations

The following table shows the combinations of source and target database server products and EDB Postgres Advanced Server compatibility configuration modes permitted by Replication Server for single-master replication systems. The left-hand column lists the possible source database server products, including the possible EDB Postgres Advanced Server compatibility configuration modes. The top row lists the same set of possible target database server products and EDB Postgres Advanced Server compatibility configuration modes.

`Yes` at the intersection of a source and target indicates that Replication Server permits replication using that combination of database server configurations for a publication and its associated subscription. `No` indicates replication isn't permitted for that combination.

## Permitted MMR database server configurations

For multi-master replication systems, each primary node acts as both a source for all primary nodes and a target for all primary nodes. Thus, the permitted database servers comprising a particular multi-master replication system or cluster is determined by the overall composition of the cluster, which is initially established when selecting the database type of the primary definition node (see Step 3 in [Adding the primary definition node](../06_mmr_operation/02_creating_publication_mmr/#adding_pdn)). 

The two basic cluster types can be characterized as follows:

-   PostgreSQL-compatible cluster. All primary nodes must consist of PostgreSQL database servers or EDB Postgres Advanced Servers installed in PostgreSQL-compatible configuration mode.
-   EDB Postgres Advanced Server Oracle-compatible cluster. All primary nodes must consist of EDB Postgres Advanced Servers installed in Oracle-compatible configuration mode.

The following table summarizes the permitted database server configurations allowed in the two cluster types. The left-hand column lists the possible database server products, including the possible EDB Postgres Advanced Server compatibility configuration modes. The top row lists the supported cluster types.

`Yes` at the intersection of a database server and cluster type indicates that Replication Server permits the database server and the specified configuration mode in the cluster type. `No` indicates the database server and the specified configuration mode can't be used in the cluster type.
