You can install Replication Server 7.0 when you have existing single-master or multi-master replication systems that are running under Replication Server version 7.0.

It is assumed that you are installing Replication Server 7.0 on the same host machine that is currently running Replication Server 6.2.x and that you will then manage the existing replication systems using Replication Server 7.0.

A direct upgrade is supported only from Replication Server versions 6.2.x.

After upgrading to version 6.2, you can then upgrade to 7.0.

If you are using a version of Replication Server older than 6.2.x, first upgrade to 6.2.x, and then upgrade to version 7.0.
