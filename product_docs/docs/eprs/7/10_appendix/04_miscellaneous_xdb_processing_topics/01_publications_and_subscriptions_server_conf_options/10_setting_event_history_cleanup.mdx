The event history cleanup job is scheduled to run every day at 12 a.m. to remove completed, historical, event and replication history data from the control schema `xdb_events`, `xdb_events_status`, `xdb_pub_replog`, and `xdb_pub_table_replog` tables that are older than `n` days. By default, the history data older than seven days is removed.

Specify a value of `0` to clean up all completed event history and replication history data, regardless of its age.

See [Cleaning up event history](../../../07_common_operations/05_managing_history/#clean_event_history) for information on cleaning up event and replication history.

`historyCleanupDaysThreshold=n`

The default value is `7`.
