title: "Skipping migration of column DEFAULT clause"
---

## Use cases

- The suscription database is in read-only mode. Therefore, DEFAULT clause columns serve no purpose as 
  they are already applied on the publication database. 
  You can skip migrating DEFAULT columns for faster processing.

- Sequences are not migrated during replication operations. 
  If a DEFAULT clause depends on a Sequence, the DEFAULT clause migration will fail.
  You can skip migrating DEFAULT columns to avoid migration failures.

## Configuration

To skip the replication of a DEFAULT clause, update the below option to true:  

```
skipColDefaultClause=true
```

By default, this option is disabled (`skipColDefaultClause=false`).


!!!note Note
   This option applies only to the subscription server.
