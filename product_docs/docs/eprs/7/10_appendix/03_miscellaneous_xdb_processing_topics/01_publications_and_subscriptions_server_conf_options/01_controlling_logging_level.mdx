!!! Note
    These options apply to the publication server and the subscription server unless otherwise specified.

The following options control various aspects of message logging in the publication server log file, the subscription server log file, and the Migration Toolkit log file.

See [Publication and subscription server startup failures](../../02_resolving_problems/02_where_to_look_for_errors/#pub_and_sub_startup_failures) and [Snapshot replication failures](../../02_resolving_problems/02_where_to_look_for_errors/#snapshot_replication_failures) for more information.

## `logging.level`

Set the `logging.level` option to control the severity of messages written to the publication server log file and the subscription server log file.

`logging.level={OFF | SEVERE | WARNING | INFO | CONFIG | FINE | FINER | FINEST | ALL}`

The default value is `WARNING`.

## `logging.file.size`

Set the `logging.file.size` option to control the maximum file size (in megabytes) of the publication server log file and the subscription server log file.

!!! Note
    If `logging.file.count` is set to `0`, the setting of `logging.file.size` is ignored. The log file is allowed to grow without limit.

`logging.file.size=n`

The default value is `50`, in megabytes.

## `logging.file.count`

Set the `logging.file.count` option to control the number of files in the log file rotation history of the publication server log file and the subscription server log file.

`logging.file.count=n`

The default value is `20`.

A non-zero value of n specifies the maximum number of log files to create.

!!! Note
    The publication server log file named `pubserver.log` is used here as an example. For the subscription server, the log file is named `subserver.log`.

-   Specify a value of `0` to disable log file rotation and create a single, unlimited size log file named `pubserver.log`. This log file will grow to an unlimited size, ignoring any setting of `logging.file.size`.
-   Specify a value of `1` to disable log file rotation and create a single, limited-size log file named `pubserver.log`. The log file is deleted and a new one is created each time the log file reaches the size limit set by `logging.file.size`.
-   Specify a value of `2` or greater to enable log file rotation. All log file names have an integer suffix (for example, `pubserver.log.0`, `pubserver.log.1`, `pubserver.log.2`).

When log file rotation is enabled, the log file with the greatest integer suffix contains the oldest messages. When there are enough messages to generate every file in the history rotation, the oldest messages are in `pubserver.log.n-1`, where n is the setting of `logging.file.count`. Log file `pubserver.log.0` is the current, active log file containing the most recent messages.

When log file rotation is enabled and the current, active log file (`pubserver.log.0`) reaches the size specified by `logging.file.size`, then the following events occur:

-   The log file containing the oldest messages (`pubserver.log.n-1`) is deleted.
-   Each remaining log file is renamed with the next greater integer suffix (`pubserver.log.m` is renamed to `pubserver.log.m+1`, with m varying from `0` to `n-2`).
-   A new, active log file is created (`pubserver.log.0`).

## `logging.default.locale` 

Set the `logging.default.locale` option to use either the current system locale or English (en) for publication and subscription logs. 

`logging.default.locale={system | en}`

The default value is `system`.

!!!Note
This option is applicable only for publication and subscription logs and isn't supported for `mtk.log`.

The RepCLI and RepConsole logs continue showing text in the default locale.
!!!

## `mtk.logging.file.size`

!!! Note
    This option applies only to the publication server.

Set the `mtk.logging.file.size` option to control the maximum file size (in megabytes) of the Migration Toolkit log file.

`mtk.logging.file.size=n`

The default value is `50`, in megabytes.

## `mtk.logging.file.count`

!!! Note
    This option applies only to the publication server.

Set the `mtk.logging.file.count` option to control the number of files in the log file rotation history of the Migration Toolkit log file.

`mtk.logging.file.count=n`

The default value for n is `20`.

A non-zero value of n specifies the maximum number of history log files to create.

-   Specify a value of `0` to disable log file rotation and create a single, limited-size log file named `mtk.log`. The log file is deleted and a new one is created each time the log file reaches the size limit set by `mtk.logging.file.size`.
-   Specify a value of `1` or greater to enable log file rotation. All log file names have an integer suffix (for example, `mtk.log.1, mtk.log.2`).

When log file rotation is enabled, the log file with the greatest integer suffix contains the oldest messages. When there are enough messages to generate every file in the history rotation, the oldest messages are in `mtk.log.n`, where `n` is the setting of `mtk.logging.file.count`.

Log file `mtk.log` is the current, active log file containing the most recent messages.

When the current, active log file (`mtk.log`) reaches the size specified by `mtk.logging.file.size`, then the following events occur:

-   The log file containing the oldest messages (`mtk.log.n`) is deleted.
-   Each remaining log file with a suffix is renamed with the next greater integer suffix (`mtk.log.m` is renamed to `mtk.log.m+1`, with `m` varying from `1` to `n-1`).
-   Log file `mtk.log` is renamed to `mtk.log.1`.
-   A new, active log file is created (`mtk.log`).
