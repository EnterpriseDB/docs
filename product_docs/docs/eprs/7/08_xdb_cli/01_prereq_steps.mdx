Perform these installation and setup steps before using the Replication Server CLI.

The Replication Server CLI is included if you choose the Replication Server console component when installing Replication Server. The Replication Server CLI is a Java application found in the directory `XDB_HOME/bin`.

1.  Follow the installation steps in [Installation and uninstallation](../installing/) to install Replication Server.

1.  Follow the prerequisite steps in [Prerequisite steps](../05_smr_operation/01_prerequisites/) for single-master replication systems or [Prerequisite steps](../05_smr_operation/01_prerequisites/#prerequisites) for multi-master replication systems.

1.  Set the Java Runtime Environment: 

    The Java Runtime Environment (JRE) must be present on the host from which you intend to run the Replication Server CLI. The Java runtime `bin` directory must be included in the path of the operating system user name that will run Replication Server CLI.

    The Replication Server startup configuration file, `xdbReplicationServer-xx.config`, contains the path of the JRE runtime program that was detected during the installation of Replication Server. The following is an example of the Replication Server startup configuration file. (See [Installation details](/eprs/latest/installing/installation_details) for the location of this file.)

    ```sql
    #!/bin/sh

    JAVA_EXECUTABLE_PATH="/usr/bin/java"
    JAVA_MINIMUM_VERSION=1.7
    JAVA_BITNESS_REQUIRED=64
    JAVA_HEAP_SIZE="-Xms256m -Xmx1536m"
    PUBPORT=9051
    SUBPORT=9052
    ```

    For example, using the JRE path shown in the configuration file, enter the following on the command line or add it to your profile:

    `export PATH=/usr/bin:$PATH`

    On Windows systems, open the Properties dialog box of My Computer. Select **Advanced System Settings**, and then select **Environment Variables**. Edit the `Path` system environment variable to include the Java Runtime Environment `bin` directory. Alternatively, you can set the path for just the current session when you open the Command Prompt as in the following example:

    `SET Path=C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_45\bin;%Path%`
