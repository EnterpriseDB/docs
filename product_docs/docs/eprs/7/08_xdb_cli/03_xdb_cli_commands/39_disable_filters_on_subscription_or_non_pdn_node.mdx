<div id="disable_filters_on_subscription_or_non_pdn_node" class="registered_link"></div>

The `disablefilter` command disables one or more filter rules on a single-master replication system subscription or on a multi-master replication system primary node other than the primary definition node.

## Synopsis

```text
-disablefilter
  -repsvrfile pubsvrfile
{ -subname subname | -dbid dbid }
  -filterids filterid_1 [ filterid_2 ] ...
```

Disabling a filter rule prevents it from being applied to the specified target subscription or non-MDN node and thus doesn't filter the data during replication from the source table to the target table.

See [Table filters](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/13_table_filters/#table_filters) for more information.

Disable the filter rule as follows:

**For SMR:** Use the `disablefilter` command or the Replication Server console (see [Enabling and disabling table filters on a subscription](../../05_smr_operation/05_managing_subscription/04_enable_filters_on_subscription/#enable_filters_on_subscription)).

**For MMR:** Use the `disablefilter` command or the Replication Server console (see [Enabling and disabling table filters on a primary node](../../06_mmr_operation/09_enable_disable_table_filters/#enable_disable_table_filters)).

Disabling a filter rule doesn't remove its definition from the publication. The filter rule still exists and you can still enable it on target subscriptions or non-MDN nodes.

To remove a filter rule so that it no longer exists, use the `removefilter` command (see [Removing a table filter from a publication](22_removing_tablefilters_to_publication/#removing_tablefilters_to_publication)) or the Replication Server console (see [Updating the set of available table filters in a publication](../../07_common_operations/06_managing_publication/04_updating_table_filters_in_pub/#updating_table_filters_in_pub)).

## Parameters

`pubsvrfile`

The file containing the publication server login information.

`subname`

**For SMR only:** The name of the subscription containing the tables on which to disable the filter rules.

`dbid`

**For MMR only:** The publication database ID of the non-MDN node containing the tables on which to disable the filter rules.

`filterid_n`

One or more filter IDs separated by space characters. These IDs identify the currently enabled table filters to disable in the SMR subscription specified by `subname` or in the MMR non-MDN node specified by `dbid`.

## Examples

This example disables a filter rule on a subscription of a single-master replication system.

```text
$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -disablefilter -repsvrfile ~/pubsvrfile.prop \
>   -subname analysts_managers_sub \
>   -filterids 47
Disabling filters...
Filter rule(s) updated successfully.
```

This example disables multiple filter rules on a primary node that isn't the primary definition node of a multi-master replication system.

```text
$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -disablefilter -repsvrfile ~/pubsvrfile.prop \
>   -dbid 139 \
>   -filterids 8 16
Disabling filters...
Filter rule(s) updated successfully.
```
