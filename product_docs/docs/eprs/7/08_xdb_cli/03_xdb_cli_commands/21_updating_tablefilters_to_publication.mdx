title: "Updating table filters in a publication (updatefilter)"

<div id="updating_tablefilters_to_publication" class="registered_link"></div>

The `updatefilter` command changes the filter clauses of the specified tables or views.

## Synopsis

```shell
-updatefilter pubname
  -repsvrfile pubsvrfile
  -tablesfilterclause
    "filterid_1:filterclause_1"
  [ "filterid_2:filterclause_2" ] ...
```

The next replication to any target subscriptions or non-MDN nodes on which these filter rules were enabled reflects the changes to the filter clauses.

See [Table filters](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/13_table_filters/#table_filters) for more information.

## Parameters

`pubname`

The name of the publication in which to update the filter clauses.

`pubsvrfile`

The file containing the publication server login information.

`filterid_n`

Filter ID identifying the filter rule for which to change the filter clause. Use the `printpubfilterslist` command to get the filter IDs for the available filter rules in the publication (see [Printing a list of filters in a publication](17_print_publications_filters_list/#print_publications_filters_list)).

`filterclause_n`

The new filter clause to use.

## Examples

This example modifies filter clause with filter `ID 26` in publication `analysts_managers`.

```shell
$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -updatefilter analysts_managers \
>   -repsvrfile ~/pubsvrfile.prop \
>   -tablesfilterclause "26:job = 'CLERK'"
Updating Filter(s)
Filter clause:[26:job = 'CLERK']
Filter(s) updated successfully.
```
