The `encrypt` command encrypts the text supplied in an input file and writes the encrypted result to a specified output file. Use the `encrypt` command to generate an encrypted password to copy into a text file. This text file is referenced by a Replication Server CLI command that requires a user name and the userâ€™s password.

## Synopsis

```
-encrypt -input <infile> -output <pwdfile> [-passwordEncryptionMethod {DES-MD5|AES-SHA256}]
```

The text in `infile` is processed using an encryption algorithm, and the encrypted text is written to file `pwdfile`. 
Make sure that `infile` contains only the text that you want to encrypt and that there are no extra characters or empty lines before or after the text that you want to encrypt.

## Parameters

`infile`

The file containing the text to be encrypted.

`pwdfile`

The file containing the encrypted form of the text from `infile`.

`-passwordEncryptionMethod` 

Defines the algorithm used to encrypt the password (`DES-MD5` or `AES-SHA256`). If the flag is omitted, the algorith defaults to `DES-MD5`. To override the default `DES-MD5` encryption with the FIPS-compliant `AES-SHA256` encryption, use `-passwordEncryptionMethod AES-SHA256`.

`AES-SHA256` offers stronger protection and supports FIPS, whereas `DES-MD5` is backwards compatible with previous versions.

!!!note
Ensure you use the same encryption method in the publication and subscription servers of a replication cluster.

## Examples

### Encrypt a password with DES-MD5

1.  Create a text file with your password using the editor of your choice. Here, `infile` contains the word `password`.

    ```
    password
    ```

1.  Execute the `encrypt` command to produce a file named `pwdfile`.

    ```shell
    java -jar edb-repcli.jar -encrypt -input ~/infile -output ~/pwdfile
    ```

    The content of file pwdfile contains the encrypted form of `password`, namely `ygJ9AxoJEX854elcVIJPTw==`.

1.  Copy and paste the encrypted password into the Replication Server configuration file: 

    ```ini
    #xDB Replication Server Configuration Properties
    admin_password=ygJ9AxoJEX854elcVIJPTw==
    admin_user=admin
    ```

### Encrypt a password with AES-SHA256

1.  Create a text file with your password using the editor of your choice. Here, `infile` contains the word `password`.

    ```
    password
    ```

1.  Execute the `encrypt` command to produce a file named `pwdfile`.

    ```shell
    java -jar edb-repcli.jar -encrypt -input ~/infile -output ~/pwdfile -passwordEncryptionMethod AES-SHA256
    ```

    The content of file pwdfile contains a FIPS-compliant, AES-SHA256 encrypted form of `password`, namely `BThrXGs/gVmStAV88Yl/U2UjoKXVs9qq56j1n/ZnR05Eyg48`.

    !!!note 
    If you reran the `encrypt` command with the same password input, the generated encrypted password would be a different each time. 
    !!!

1.  Copy and paste the encrypted password into the Replication Server configuration file: 

    ```ini
    #xDB Replication Server Configuration Properties
    admin_password=BThrXGs/gVmStAV88Yl/U2UjoKXVs9qq56j1n/ZnR05Eyg48
    admin_user=admin
    ```

1.  Enable the AES-SHA256 encryption in both the `xdb_pubserver.conf` and `xdb_subserver.conf` files by uncommenting the `passwordEncryptionMethod=AES-SHA256` line.

    ```shell
    [...]
    #Select the encryption method used to protect database connection and replication
    #server passwords. The AES-SHA256 (PBEWithHmacSHA256AndAES_256) offers stronger
    #protection and is recommended. The default is set to DES-MD5 (PBEWithMD5AndDES)
    #for compatibility with the existing cluster configurations.
    passwordEncryptionMethod=AES-SHA256
    
    #########################################
    ### SSL Configuration                 ###
    #########################################
    [...]
    ```

### Change the encryption method

To change the encryption method of an existing Replication Server CLI user password, you must create a new password with the new encryption method, and then replace the password on existing objects.

This example changes the encryption algorithm from `DES-MD5` to `AES-SHA256`.

1.  Stop the Publication and Subscription servers.

1.  Enable AES-SHA256 encryption in both `xdb_pubserver.conf` and `xdb_subserver.conf` files by uncommenting the `passwordEncryptionMethod=DES-MD5` line and modifying it to `passwordEncryptionMethod=AES-SHA256`.

    ```shell
    [...]
    #Select the encryption method used to protect database connection and replication
    #server passwords. The AES-SHA256 (PBEWithHmacSHA256AndAES_256) offers stronger
    #protection and is recommended. The default is set to DES-MD5 (PBEWithMD5AndDES)
    #for compatibility with the existing cluster configurations.
    passwordEncryptionMethod=AES-SHA256
    
    #########################################
    ### SSL Configuration                 ###
    #########################################
    [...]
    ```

1.  Create and encrypt a new password for the Replication Server admin user.

    Create a text file with your password using the editor of your choice. Here, `infile` contains the word `password`.

    ```
    password
    ```

    Execute the `encrypt` command to produce a file named `pwdfile`.

    ```shell
    java -jar edb-repcli.jar -encrypt -input ~/infile -output ~/pwdfile -passwordEncryptionMethod AES-SHA256
    ```

1.  Update the previous DES-MD5 password with the new AES-SHA256 password in the `edb-repl.conf` control file which contains connectivity credentials. You must change the password in two places:

    - Replace the value for `admin_password`, which corresponds to the Replication Server `admin_user`.
    
    - Replace the value for the password that corresponds to the Replication Server control database user.

1.  Create new encrypted passwords for Publication Server users, and replace the previous DES-MD5 passwords with the new AES-SHA256 passwords in the Publication database:

    - First, retrieve the IDs of all database connections from the Replication Server control database and note down the `pub_db_id` values:

      ```sql
      SELECT pub_db_id, db_host, db_port, db_user, db_name FROM _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_pub_database;
      ```

    - Then, generate encrypted passwords for each of the Publication database users using the Replication Server CLI with `-encrypt` option as previously explained.

    - Finally, update each of the Publication database user passwords. Replace `<NEW_ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD>` with the new password and `<PUB_DB_ID>` with each of the IDs previously noted.

      ```sql
      UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_pub_database SET db_password = '<NEW_ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD>' WHERE pub_db_id = <PUB_DB_ID>;
      ```

1.  Create new encrypted passwords for Subscription database users, and replace the previous DES-MD5 password with the new AES-SHA256 password in the Subscription database: 

    - First, retrieve the IDs of all database connections from the Replication Server control database and note down the `sub_db_id` values:

      ```sql
      SELECT sub_db_id, db_host, db_port, db_user, db_name FROM _edb_replicator_sub.xdb_sub_database;
      ```

    - Then, generate encrypted passwords for each of the Subscription database users using the Replication Server CLI with `-encrypt` option as previously explained.

    - Finally, update each of the Subscription database user passwords. Replace `<NEW_ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD>`with the new password and `<SUB_DB_ID>` with the ID previously noted.    

      ```sql
      UPDATE _edb_replicator_sub.xdb_sub_database SET db_password = '<NEW_ENCRYPTED_PASSWORD>' WHERE sub_db_id = <SUB_DB_ID>;
      ```

1.  Restart the Publication and Subscription Servers and verify that the replication is running successfully. See [Registering a publication server](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) to learn how to restart Publication Server.

1.  If you are using the GUI Console, unregister and register all Publication and Subscription servers.

    If you are using the CLI, create an encrypted password for the admin user based on the AES-SHA256 encryption method and paste it into the Replication Server configuration file: 

    ```shell
    #xDB Replication Server Configuration Properties
    admin_password=BThrXGs/gVmStAV88Yl/U2UjoKXVs9qq56j1n/ZnR05Eyg48
    admin_user=admin
    ```

### Bouncy Castle integration 

Replication Server is also certified with the Bouncy Castle FIPS library. If you want to use Bouncy Castle as a provider, you must first enable the library for Replication Server. This way, Replication Server can use it to encrypt passwords using the FIPS-compliant AES-SHA256 algorithm. 

Since the library is not bundled with the Java security framework, you must download and configure it for use with Replication Server:

1.  [Download the Bouncy Castle FIPS library](https://www.bouncycastle.org/download/bouncy-castle-java-fips/) and place it under `EPRS_HOME/lib`.

1.  Bouncy Castle FIPS jar version `bc-fips-2.1.0.jar` is configured by default for Replication Server. If you want to use a different version, create a symlink named `bc-fips.jar` that points to the actual jar.

1.  Modify the `java.security` file for your JRE to include Bouncy Castle as a security provider. Ensure its provider number places it higher in preference than other existing providers.

    ```
    security.provider.1=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleFipsProvider
    ```

1.  Restart Replication Server services to dynamically load the Bouncy Castle FIPS library and register it in the Java security framework.
