The `encrypt` command encrypts the text supplied in an input file and writes the encrypted result to a specified output file. Use the `encrypt` command to generate an encrypted password to copy into a text file. This text file is referenced by a Replication Server CLI command that requires a user name and the userâ€™s password.

## Synopsis

`-encrypt -input infile -output pwdfile [-passwordencryptionMethod=AES-SHA256]`

The text in `infile` is processed using the DES-MD5 (default) or AES-SHA256 algorithm, and the encrypted text is written to file `pwdfile`. Make sure that `infile` contains only the text that you want to encrypt and that there are no extra characters or empty lines before or after the text that you want to encrypt.

## Parameters

`infile`

The file containing the text to be encrypted.

`pwdfile`

The file containing the encrypted form of the text from `infile`.

`passwordencryptionMethod` 

Defines the algorithm used to encrypt the password. Set to `-passwordencryptionMethod=AES-SHA256` to override the default `DES-MD5` configuration. AES-SHA256 offers stronger protection and supports FIPS, whereas DES-MD5 is backwards compatible with previous versions.

## Examples

### Encrypt a password with DES-MD5

The file `infile` contains the word `password`.

`password`

Executing the `encrypt` command produces a file named `pwdfile`.

`$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -encrypt -input ~/infile -output ~/pwdfile`

The content of file pwdfile contains the encrypted form of `password`.

### Encrypt a password with AES-SHA256

The file `infile` contains the word `password`.

`password`

Executing the `encrypt` command produces a file named `pwdfile`.

`$ java -jar edb-repcli.jar -encrypt -input ~/infile -output ~/pwdfile -passwordEncryptionMethod=AES-SHA256`

The content of file pwdfile contains the FIPS-compliant, AES-SHA256 encrypted form of `password`.
