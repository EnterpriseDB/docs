This information applies only to Postgres database servers of version 9.4 and later. If you plan to use the log-based method of synchronization replication with any publication database running under the Postgres database server, the following configuration parameter settings are required in the configuration file, `postgresql.conf`, of the Postgres database server:

-   `wal_level`. Set to `logical`.
-   `max_wal_senders`. Specifies the maximum number of concurrent connections (that is, the maximum number of simultaneously running WAL sender processes). Set, at minimum, to the number of SMR publication databases on this database server that use the log-based method. In addition, if MMR primary nodes are to run on this database server, also add the number of MMR primary nodes that use the log-based method.
-   `max_replication_slots`. Specifies the maximum number of replication slots. Set, at minimum, to the number of SMR publication databases on this database server that use the log-based method. In addition, if MMR primary nodes run on this database server with the log-based method, see [Replication origin](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/10_sync_replication_log_based/04_replication_origin/#replication_origin) for information on the additional number of replication slots required.

See [Synchronization replication with the log-based method](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/10_sync_replication_log_based/#sync_replication_log_based).

You must restart the Postgres database server after altering any of these configuration parameters.

In addition, the `pg_hba.conf` file requires an entry for each publication database user of publication databases that use the log-based method. Include these database users as a replication database user in the `pg_hba.conf` file. See [Postgres server authentication](06_verifying_host_accessibility/#postgres_server_auth) for additional information.
