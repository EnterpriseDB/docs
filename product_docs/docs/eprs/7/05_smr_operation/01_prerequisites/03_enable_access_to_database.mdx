<div id="enable_access_to_database" class="registered_link"></div>

Use these configuration steps to use Replication Server on various types of database servers.

No special steps are required to enable access to a Postgres database server.

<div id="enable_access_to_oracle" class="registered_link"></div>

## Enabling access to Oracle

!!! Note
    The instructions in this section apply only if Oracle is used as the publication or subscription database.

An Oracle JDBC driver `jar` file, such as `ojdbc8.jar`, must be accessible to the Java virtual machine (JVM) on the host running the publication server and the subscription server. If the publication server and subscription server are running on separate hosts, the Oracle JDBC driver must be accessible to the JVM on each host. Use Oracle JDBC driver version ojdbc8 or later.

**Step 1:** Download the Oracle JDBC driver, for example, `ojdbc8.jar`, from the Oracle download site to the host that runs the publication server.

**Step 2:** Copy the file `ojdbc8.jar` to the directory `XDB_HOME/lib/jdbc.`

```text
$ su root
Password:
$ cd /usr/edb/xdb/lib/jdbc
$ cp /home/user/Downloads/ojdbc8.jar .
$ ls -l
total 4032
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root  355655 Jan 25 02:38 edb-jdbc14.jar
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root  716209 Jan 25 02:38 edb-jdbc17.jar
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root  317816 Jan 25 02:38 jtds-1.3.1.jar
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2091137 Jan 28 16:45 ojdbc8.jar
-rw-rw-r-- 1 root root  642809 Jan 25 02:38 postgresql-9.4-1201.jdbc4.jar
```

!!! Note
    You can also copy the `ojdbc8.jar` file to the `jre/lib/ext` subdirectory of the location where you installed your Java runtime environment.

!!! Note
    Make sure to set the ODBC driver permission to a minimum of `644`.

!!! Note
    Make sure to copy `xdb6.jar` along with `ojdbc8.jar` at `/usr/edb/xdb/lib/jdbc/` if one or more tables in Oracle Publication contains an `XMLType` column when using Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server/PostgreSQL replication.

**Step 3:** If the subscription server is running on a host different from the publication server, repeat steps 1 and 2 for the subscription server host.

## Enabling access to SQL Server

!!! Note
    These instructions apply only if you're using SQL Server as the publication or subscription database.

The jTDS JDBC driver `jar` file `jtds-1.3.1.jar` must be accessible to the Java virtual machine (JVM) on the host running the publication server and the subscription server. If the publication server and subscription server are running on separate hosts, the `jTDS JDBC` driver must be accessible to the JVM on each host.

When you install Replication Server, the `jtds-1.3.1.jar` file is placed in the directory `XDB_HOME/lib/jdbc` so there is no manual configuration needed for this requirement.

**Step 1:** Be sure SQL Server Authentication mode is enabled on your SQL Server database engine. SQL Server Authentication mode allows the use of SQL Server logins such as the built-in system administrator login, sa.

Using the default settings for SQL Server installation, only Windows Authentication mode is enabled, which uses the accounts of the Windows operating system for authentication.

To permit SQL Server Authentication mode, you must change the authentication mode to Mixed Mode Authentication, which permits both Windows Authentication and SQL Server Authentication.

You can do this using SQL Server Management Studio. Refer to the [SQL Server Management Studio documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-ver15).

**Step 2:** Be sure SQL Server is accepting TCP/IP connections. In the SQL Server Configuration Manager, under SQL Server Network Configuration, be sure the TCP/IP protocol for the SQL Server instance is set to `Enabled`. The typical, default SQL Server instance names are `MSSQLSERVER` or `SQLEXPRESS`.

**Step 3 (Required only for a SQL Server publication database):** Be sure SQL Server Agent is enabled and running. SQL Server Agent is a Windows service that controls job scheduling and execution with SQL Server.

Replication Server uses SQL Server Agent for certain operations such as for scheduled shadow table history cleanup (see [Scheduling shadow table history cleanup](../../07_common_operations/05_managing_history/#schedule_shadow_table_history_cleanup)).

You can start SQL Server Agent by using SQL Server Configuration Manager. Refer to the [SQL Server Configuration Manager documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/sql-server-configuration-manager?view=sql-server-ver15).
