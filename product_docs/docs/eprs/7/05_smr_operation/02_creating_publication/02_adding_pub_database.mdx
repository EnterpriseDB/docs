You must identify to Replication Server the database for publications by creating a publication database definition.

After you create the publication database definition, a Publication Database node representing that publication database definition appears in the replication tree of the Replication Server console. You can then create publications for containing tables and views residing in this database under the Publication Database node.

You must enter database connection information such as the database server network address, database identifier, and database login user name and password when you create the publication database definition. The publication server uses the connection information to access the publication tables and views when it performs replication.

1. Make sure the database server in which the publication database resides is running and accepting client connections.

1. Select the SMR type node under the Publication Server node. Select **Publication > Publication Database > Add Database**. 

1. In the Publication Service â€“ Add Database dialog box, fill in the following fields:

   -   **Database Type**. Select **Oracle**, **SQL Server**, **PostgreSQL**, or **Postgres Plus Advanced Server** for the type of publication database. For an EDB Postgres Advanced Server Oracle-compatible installation, select the **Postgres Plus Advanced Server** option. For PostgreSQL or an Advanced Server PostgreSQL-compatible installation, select the **PostgreSQL** option.
   -   **Host**. IP address of the host where the publication database server is running.
   -   **Port**. Port on which the publication database server is listening for connections.
   -   **User**. The publication database user name created in Step 1 of [Preparing the publication database](../01_prerequisites/04_preparing_pub_database/#preparing_pub_database).
   -   **Password**. Password of the database user.
   -   **Service ID** (For Oracle). Enter the Oracle system identifier (SID) of the Oracle instance running the publication database if **SID** is selected. Enter the net service name of a connect descriptor as defined in the `TNSNAMES.ORA` file if **Service Name** is selected. For Oracle 12c pluggable database), use the service name.
   -   **Database (For Postgres or SQL Server)**. Enter the Postgres or SQL Server database name.
   -   **URL Options (For SSL connectivity).** Enter the URL options to establish SSL connectivity to the publication database. See [Using secure sockets layer (SSL) connections](../../07_common_operations/11_using_ssl_connections/#using_ssl_connections) for more information.
   -   **Changeset Logging (For Postgres)**. Select **Table Triggers** to use the trigger-based method of synchronization replication. Select **WAL Stream** to use the log-based method of synchronization replication. For more information, see [Synchronization replication with the trigger-based method](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/09_sync_replication_trigger_based/#sync_replication_trigger_based) and [Synchronization replication with the log-based method](../../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/10_sync_replication_log_based/#sync_replication_log_based).

    !!! Note
      If the controller database is an Oracle or SQL Server publication database, then you can't add a second Oracle or SQL Server publication database to create a second single-master replication system. For Replication Server to run more than one single-master replication systems consisting of Oracle or SQL Server publication databases, designate a Postgres publication database as the controller database. See [Controller database](../../02_overview/03_replication_server_components_and_architecture/01_physical_components/#controller_database) for more information.


4. Select **Test**. When Test Result: Success appears, select **OK** and then select **Save**.

   When the publication database definition is successfully saved, a Publication Database node is added to the replication tree under the Publication Server node.

   **For Oracle only:** You can add multiple Oracle databases as publication databases by completing the Add Database dialog box for each database. You can also add the same Oracle database as two or more distinct publication database definitions if you use different publication database user names for each publication database definition.

   **For Postgres or SQL Server:** You can add multiple Postgres or SQL Server databases as publication databases by completing the Add Database dialog box for each database. However, unlike Oracle, you can add a given Postgres or SQL Server database as a publication database definition only once.
