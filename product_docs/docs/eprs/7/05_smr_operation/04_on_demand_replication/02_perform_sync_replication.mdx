After the first snapshot replication, you cam perform later replications using synchronization replication if the publication wasn't created as a snapshot-only publication.

1.  In the Replication Server console, when the trigger-based method of synchronization replication is in use, select the Subscription node of the subscription for which you want to perform synchronization replication.

    When the log-based method of synchronization replication is in use, select the Subscription node of any subscription. For the log-based method, the synchronization replication is performed on all subscriptions regardless of which one you select.

1.  Select **Subscription > Synchronize**. 

1.  In the Synchronize dialog box, select **Synchronize** to start synchronization replication. Subscription Synchronized Successfully appears if the synchronization was successful. 

1.  Select **OK**.

You can see the operations that were applied to the subscription tables in the replication history. See [Viewing replication history](../../07_common_operations/04_view_replication_history/#view_replication_history) for more information.
