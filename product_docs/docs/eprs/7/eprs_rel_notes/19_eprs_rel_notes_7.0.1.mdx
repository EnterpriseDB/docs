New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Replication Server 7.0.1 include the following:

| Type        | Description |
| ----------- |------------ |
| Security fix| Addresses JDBC vulnerability CVE-2022-21724 that has a CVSS score of 8.5, which is a High severity. The PostgreSQL JDBC driver version 42.3.2 that contains the security fix is bundled with Replication Server. If you have a RPM- or Debian-based Replication Server installation, the EDB JDBC driver for Advanced Server, which incorporates the community version 42.3.2, needs to be updated. For example, on RHEL 7 or CentOS 7 distributions, run: `yum update edb-jdbc`. |
| Bug fix     | Fixed the issue where database registration fails with the error `libpq JNI wrapper library is not available` for WAL-based CDC on Windows. |
