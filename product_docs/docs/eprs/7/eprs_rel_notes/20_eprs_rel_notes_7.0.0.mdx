Released: 01 Dec 2021

!!! Note
    The 7.0 version is backward compatible with 6.2.x and provides a non-breaking upgrade path for the existing cluster deployments. However, it is strongly recommended to verify it in a staging or nonproduction environment before applying the upgrade in a production environment.

New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Replication Server 7.0 include the following:

| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ----------- |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| New feature | The Publication and Subscription Server configuration options can be modified and applied without requiring a server restart. The CLI now exposes a new command `reloadconf` to reload the updated configuration values at runtime.    |
| New feature | Replication Server is enhanced to support replication from EDB Postgres Advanced Server (non-redwood mode) and PostgreSQL to Oracle.                                                                                                   |
| Enhancement | Replication Server is certified to support PostgreSQL v14 and EDB Postgres Advanced Server v14.                                                                                                                                        |
| Enhancement | Table-level parallel data loading significantly improves initial Snapshot data replication time for large size Publication tables. The benchmarks reveal 3X to 30X performance improvement for a given workload and related options.   |
| Enhancement | Row-level Filtering capability is enhanced to allow inclusion/exclusion of data based on a sub-query [1284035].                                                                                                                        |
| Enhancement | The CLI command `addtablesintopub` is enhanced to expose an option to enable row-level filter for the target Subscription (SMR)/Master (MMR) nodes [1321993].                                                                          |
| Enhancement | The CLI commands `createpub` and `addtablesintopub` now support a new option to allow the users to add all the tables to a Publication without requiring individual table identification [1273701].                                    |
| Enhancement | The CLI commands `createpub` and `addtablesintopub` are enhanced to allow the user specify a single custom conflict resolution option applicable for multiple tables [731271].                                                         |
| Enhancement | Table(s) can be added into an existing Publication by skipping schema replication [926058].                                                                                                                                            |
| Enhancement | The Replication GUI displays additional replication stats on the Real-time Monitor tab to monitor the status of the cluster [795247].                                                                                                  |
| Enhancement | Replication of the HASH partition table is now supported from Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server.                                                                                                                                  |
| Enhancement | Incremental replication of CLOB, BLOB, and XMLType is now supported from Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server.                                                                                                                       |
| Enhancement | Support added for replication of JSON data type from PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server to Oracle.                                                                                                                            |

| Big fix     | Fixed an issue where the filter clause fails when applied for a table list with more than 10 tables.                                                                                                                                   |
| Bug fix     | Fixed an issue where the add filter command picked the incorrect table index for the filter clause in the WAL mode replication.                                                                                                        |
| Bug fix     | In a hybrid replication cluster, the cleanup shadow table routine is subject to remove unprocessed changes.                                                                                                                            |
