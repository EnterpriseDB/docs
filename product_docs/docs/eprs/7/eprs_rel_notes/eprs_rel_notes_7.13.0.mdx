| Enhancement  | EDB Postgres Replication Server (EPRS) is now certified to work with EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 18 and PostgreSQL version 18, both as source Publication and target Subscription databases in trigger and WAL-based replication cluster configurations. |                |
| Enhancement  | Enhanced EPRS to support dynamic partition management to automatically detect and replicate EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL child partitions when they are added or removed from the published tables.                                                | #43785, #52467 |

| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue in WAL mode where dropping a Subscription did not clear its replication history leading to warnings.                                                                                                                                               | #48670         |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where a column named `OFFSET`, which is a PostgreSQL reserved word, caused synchronize replication failures.                                                                                                                                       | #51827         |
