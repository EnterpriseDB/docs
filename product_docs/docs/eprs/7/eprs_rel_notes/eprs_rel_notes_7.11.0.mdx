|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------|
| Enhancement  | EDB Postgres Replication Server (EPRS) is now certified to support replication slot failover when the publication source database is a Postgres 17.x (or later) primary cluster in a physical streaming replication, high-availability configuration, and one of the standby clusters is promoted to act as the new primary cluster. |        |
| Enhancement  | Added certification for installation and use on RHEL 9 ARM64 architectures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |        |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue that caused the shadow table cleanup operation to fail with an `ArrayIndexOutOfBounds` exception when triggered concurrently for multiple publications.                                                                                                                                                               | #41958 |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where non-primary key tables with case-sensitive names containing special character(s) caused the creation of the publication to fail.                                                                                                                                                                                |        |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue that prevented setting the `targetDBQueryTimeout` configuration option to zero to disable it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | #41958 |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where snapshot replication failed with a `NoClassDefFoundError` error for publications with an EDB Postgres Advanced Server database configured in non-redwood mode as the source database.                                                                                                                           | #42949 |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue where the registration of a PostgreSQL/EDB Postgres Advanced Server publication database failed in an existing Oracle to EDB Postgres Advanced Server SMR cluster.                                                                                                                                                    |        |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue that caused foreign key constraints for certain control tables to be recreated upon restarting the EPRS publication server. This also addresses the `Error occurred during version 7 upgrade process, shutting down Rep Serverâ€¦` issue that had been observed in certain cases when EPRS was restarted.               |        |
| Bug&nbsp;fix | Fixed an issue that could result in the creation of redundant foreign keys when an Oracle publication database is registered in an existing EDB Postgres Advanced Server to Oracle SMR cluster.                                                                                                                                      |        |
