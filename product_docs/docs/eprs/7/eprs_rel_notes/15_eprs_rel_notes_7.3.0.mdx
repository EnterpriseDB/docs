title: "Version 7.3.0"
---


New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Replication Server 7.3.0 include the following:

| Type    | Description |
| ------- |------------ |
| Enhancement  | Replication Server now provides the ability to define custom column data type mappings for the replication of tables between Oracle and EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL. The data types in the source and target databases must be of compatible types. |
| Enhancement  | Replication Server is now certified to work with the Microsoft provided SQL Server JDBC driver version 10.2. Although the open source  jTDS driver can still be used for connections to Microsoft SQL Server, it is recommended that the Microsoft provided SQL Server JDBC driver be used instead, as it provides support for the more recent versions of SQL Server. |
| Enhancement  | The synchronize process has been enhanced to optimize the `replicateDDL` operation so that it is able to complete within a reasonable time window during peak activity. [Support ticket #84057] | 
| Enhancement  | Removed the limitation of being able to add only 1000 tables to a single Oracle publication. |
| Security fix | Updated the version of the zlib library provided with the Replication Server Windows installer to version 1.2.13 to address a security vulnerability identified in CVE-2022-37434. This vulnerability is not present in the Linux distributions of Replication Server. |
| Bug fix      | Fixed an issue where the `reloadconf` Replication Server CLI command reports success even when the configuration file is not found. |
| Bug fix      | Fixed an issue that causes the synchronize operation to fail when an Oracle Publication table primary key is based on the NCHAR/NVARCHAR type and the table contains a LOB column. |
| Bug fix      | Fixed an issue that results in a publication creation failure for trigger-based replication mode if two or more tables have a common name pattern. [Support ticket #83414] |
| Bug fix      | Fixed an issue encountered in an MMR cluster where the update-update conflict resolution might not discard some of the modified column values on the database node whose values are marked to be discarded. [Support ticket #83594] |
| Bug fix      | Fixed an issue encountered in a trigger-based MMR cluster where the history cleanup job is not configured to fire automatically for non-MDN nodes. |
| Bug fix      | Fixed an issue where the synchronize operation fails if the `standard_conforming_strings` is off and the source Oracle column contains a `\’` character combination. |
