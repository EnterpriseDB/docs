## Supported upgrade paths

You can only upgrade to Replication Server 7.x from 6.2.15 or later 6.2.x point version. If you are running a version earlier than 6.2.15, you need to first upgrade to 6.2.15 or later 6.2.x point version before upgrading to 7.x.

!!!note
   Version 7.x provides a non-breaking upgrade path for existing 6.2.x based cluster deployments; however, we strongly recommended that you verify the upgrade in a staging or nonproduction environment before applying the upgrade in a production environment. There is no downgrade path from version 7.x to version 6.2.x so it is essential to test the upgrade first before applying it to the production environment.
