New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Replication Server 7.6.0 include the following:

| Type    | Description |
| ------- |------------ |
| Enhancement | EDB Replication Server now supports logging publication and subscription server logs in the English language, overriding the default locale, by way of the `logging.default.locale` configuration parameter. [Support ticket #89877]                                                                                                                                                                                   |   
| Enhancement | The snapshot operation now uses the table-level parallel loading capability. This capability reduces overhead on the source database by using range-based criterion for loading each individual table data chunk instead of a fetch-offset approach. This optimization applies when the table primary key/unique constraint is based on a noncomposite numeric type attribute. [Support ticket # 93360] |   
| Enhancement | To help investigate data synchronization gaps, Replication Server’s logging now logs when rows are skipped due to filter criteria.  [Support ticket #91296]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |   
| Bug fix     | Fixed an issue where metadata from the primary controller database wasn't replicated when a SQL Server or an Oracle publication database is added as a standby controller database.  [Support ticket #82050 and #91884]                                                                                                                                                                                        |   
| Bug fix     | Fixed the issues related to foreign key violations in the standby controller database that prevented upgrading from version 6.2.x to 7.x. [Support ticket #93129, #92056, and #91588]                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |   
| Bug fix     | Corrected a few code paths to release unused resources for timely garbage collection and optimized memory utilization. [Support ticket #91588]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |   
| Bug fix     | Fixed a data validator Oracle edge case resulting in a `String index out of range` error for an Oracle-to-EDB Postgres Advanced Server validation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |   
| Bug fix     | Fixed an issue resulting in a synchronization failure for `nchar`, `nvarchar`, `xml`, and `sqlvariant` when using the `mssql-jdbc-10.2.1.jre8.jar` file for a SQL Server-to-EDB Postgres Advanced Server cluster setup.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |   
| Bug fix     | Updated database type name references of “Postgres Plus Advanced Server” in the Replication Console and Replication CLI to “EDB Postgres Advanced Server.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |   
| Bug fix     | Fixed an issue that prevented logging of changed configuration parameters at publication and subscription server start or when the `reloadconf` command is executed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |   
| Bug fix     | Fixed a regression that led to an `Invalid custom column type mapping` error being observed for publication tables with no column mapping.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
