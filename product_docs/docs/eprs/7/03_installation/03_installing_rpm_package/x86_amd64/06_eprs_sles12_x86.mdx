navTitle: "SLES 12"

There are two steps to completing an installation:

- Setting up the repository
- Installing the package

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

To log in as a superuser:

```shell
sudo su -
```

Before setting up the repository, you need to register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).


## Set up the repository

1. Use the following commands to add EnterpriseDB repository configuration files to your SLES host:

    ```shell
    zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas96-sles.repo
    zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas-sles-tools.repo
    zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas-sles-dependencies.repo
    ```

    Each command creates a repository configuration file in the /etc/zypp/repos.d directory. The files are named:

    - `edbas96suse.repo`
    - `edbasdependencies.repo`
    - `edbastools.repo`


2. Use the `zypper refresh command` to refresh the metadata on your SLES host to include the EnterpriseDB repositories, as shown below. When prompted for a user name and password, provide your connection credentials for the EnterpriseDB repository.

    ```shell
    /etc/zypp/repos.d # zypper refresh
    __OUTPUT__
    Repository 'SLES12-12-0' is up to date.
    Repository 'SLES12-Pool' is up to date.
    Repository 'SLES12-Updates' is up to date.

    Building repository 'EDB Postgres Advanced Server 10 12 - x86_64' cache..........................[done]
    All repositories have been refreshed.
    ...
    ```

1. Add SUSEConnect and the SUSE Package Hub extension to the SLES host and register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories. Use the commands:

    ```shell
    zypper install SUSEConnect
    SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12/x86_64
    SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12/x86_64
    ```

    For detailed information about registering a SUSE host, visit:

    > <https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7016626>

1. Add the Java repository and update the repository metadata. Only OpenJDK 1.8 is supported on SLES hosts of Java components. Before using an RPM installer to add Advanced Server or a supporting component that requires Java, use `zypper` to add supporting repository locations to your system. Enter the following commands:

    ```shell
    zypper addrepo "http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Java:/Factory/SLE_12_SP2/Java:Factory.repo"
    zypper addrepo "http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/Kolab:/3.3/SLE_12/server:Kolab:3.3.repo"
    zypper refresh
    ```

## Install the package

You can install all Replication Server components with a single install command, or you may choose to install selected, individual components by installing only those particular packages.

To install all Replication Server components:

```shell
zypper install edb-xdb
```

To install an individual component:

```shell
zypper install package_name
```

Where `package_name` is:

| Package name         | Component                                                                  |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `edb-xdb-console`    | EPRS Replication Console and the Replication Server Command Line Interface |
| `edb-xdb-publisher`  | Publication server                                                         |
| `edb-xdb-subscriber` | Subscription server                                                        |

## Initial configuration

Before starting the publication server and subscription server, the `/etc/hosts` file must contain an entry for the host name that associates it to the host IP address as shown by the following example where `192.168.187.133` is the IP address and `linux-dm8s` is the host name:

```shell
192.168.187.133              linux-dm8s
```
