title: Installing Replication Server on Ubuntu 20.04 x86_64
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on a host that the product can connect to using a connection string. It doesn't need to be on the same host. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux).

- Install Java (version 1.8 or later) on your server, if not present.

  ```shell
  sudo apt-get -y install java
  ```

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

## Install the package

You can install all Replication Server components with a single install command, or you may choose to install selected, individual components by installing only those particular packages.

To install all Replication Server components:

```shell
sudo apt-get  -y install edb-xdb
```

To install an individual component:

```shell
sudo apt-get  -y install <package_name>
```

Where `<package_name>` is:

| Package name         | Component                                                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `edb-xdb-console`    | Replication console and the Replication Server command line interface |
| `edb-xdb-publisher`  | Publication server                                                    |
| `edb-xdb-subscriber` | Subscription server                                                   |
