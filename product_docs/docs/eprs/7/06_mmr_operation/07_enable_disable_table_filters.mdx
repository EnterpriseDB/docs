You must first define table filters in a set of available table filters in the publication before you can enable them on a primary node. See [Adding a publication](02_creating_publication_mmr/#add_pub_mmr) for information on defining table filters in a multi-master replication system. See [Table settings and restrictions for table filters](../02_overview/02_replication_concepts_and_definitions/13_table_filters/#table_settings_and_restrictions_for_table_filters) for table setup requirements for a log-based replication system as well as general restrictions on the use of table filters.

To enable or disable table filters on an existing primary node:

1.  In the Replication Server console, make sure the publication server whose node is the parent of the primary nodes of the replication system is running and registered in the console you're using. See [Registering a publication server](../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) to learn ho to start and register a publication server.

1.  Select the Publication Database node corresponding to the primary node on which you want to enable or disable individual filter rules.

1.  On the Publication Database node, from the context menu, select **Update Filter Rule**.

    !!! Note
        If you want to enable or disable filter rules on the current primary definition node, you must first switch the role of the primary definition node to another primary node. Switching the role causes **Update Filter Rule** to appear on the primary node context menu. See [Switching the primary definition node](08_switching_pdn) to learn how to switch the primary definition node.

    The primary node you choose as the new primary definition node must contain a superset, or at least an equivalent set, of data as the current primary definition node. This ensures that the former primary definition node contains the complete set of data to satisfy the filtering criteria. This applies after you take a snapshot from the new primary definition node to the former primary definition node on which you just enabled the table filters.

1.  In the **Filter Rules** tab, select and clear boxes to specify the filter rules to enable or disable on the primary node. You can enable at most one filter rule on any table. 

1.  Select **Save**. A confirmation box shows a warning message and a recommendation to perform a snapshot replication to any primary node on which you changed the filtering criteria.

1.  Select **OK** to proceed with the update to the filter rule selections. 

    Filter Rules Updated Successfully appears after the successful update.

We strongly recommend that you perform a snapshot replication to the primary node that contains tables on which the filtering criteria changed. A snapshot ensures that the content of the primary node tables is consistent with the updated filtering criteria. See [Performing snapshot peplication](05_on_demand_replication_mmr/#perform_snapshot_replication_mmr) for more information.

!!! Note
    The primary definition node, which provides the source of the table content for a snapshot, must contain a superset of all the data contained in the other primary nodes of the multi-master replication system. This ensures that the target of the snapshot receives all of the data that satisfies the updated filtering criteria.

If the primary definition node contains only a subset of all the data contained in the other primary nodes, then a snapshot to another primary node might not result in the complete set of data that is required for that target primary node.
