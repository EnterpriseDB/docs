!!! Note
    See [Manual conflict resolution for the trigger-based method](../09_manual_conflict_resolution_trigger_based_method/#manual_conflict_resolution_trigger_based_method) for information on manual conflict resolution for multi-master replication systems configured with the trigger-based method of synchronization replication.

As discussed in [Conflict prevention - uniqueness case](../05_conflict_prevention_uniquness/#conflict_prevention_uniquness) there's no built-in, automatic conflict-resolution strategy for the uniqueness (insert/insert) conflict. If a uniqueness conflict occurs, to resolve this conflict you must modify rows in the publication tables containing the conflict and modify rows in the control schema tables in the primary nodes.

Similarly, you must use manual correction for update/delete and delete/update conflicts. In addition, if the conflict resolution option is set to **Manual** (see [Updating the conflict-resolution options](../12_update_conflict_resolution_options/)) and a conflict occurs, you must also resolve this conflict manually.
