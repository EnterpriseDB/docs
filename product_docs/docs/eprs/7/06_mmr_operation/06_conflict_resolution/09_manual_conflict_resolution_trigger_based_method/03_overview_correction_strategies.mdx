Before you begin manual resolution correction, first determine the extent of the inconsistencies that occurred in the publication tables across the primary nodes of the replication system.

The **Conflict History** tab in the Replication Server console and the SQL query described in [Finding conflicts](01_find_conflict/#find_conflict) can help determine the source of an initial conflict.

However, once this conflict occurs, your replication system might have processed and replicated more transactions during that synchronization operation. Some of these later replications might have succeeded, but others might have failed or produced unexpected results because of the prior conflict. With a replication schedule in effect, more synchronization operations can occur, which can create more conflicts.

Therefore, when you learn that a conflict occurred, we recommend that you stop the publication server. Use the stop option of the Linux scripts or Windows services described in [Registering a publication server](../../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server).

In this way, you can carefully analyze the content of the publication tables in question as well as any pending transactions in the shadow tables. This approach helps you to determine the best course of action without continued updates by the running replication system.

When analyzing your tables. you must determine the following:

-   The publication tables that contain inconsistent rows across primary nodes (that is, missing rows on some primary nodes or rows with different column values for the same primary key on different primary nodes).
-   Pending transactions in the shadow tables not applied to the publication tables across all primary nodes. Pending transactions are denoted by a value of `P` in the `rrep_tx_conflict_status` column of the shadow table.
-   Transactions on the publication tables that have occurred and are recorded in the shadow tables following the initial conflict. Also determine whether these transactions were applied completely and correctly to the publication tables across all primary nodes. These transactions might not be marked as pending. Instead, their `rrep_tx_conflict_status` column might be set to null, meaning that no conflict was detected during replication or the transaction wasn't replicated yet. You can identify these transactions because they have a later `rrep_tx_timestamp` value than the transactions causing the initial conflict.

The general steps to resolving the problem following this analysis are the following:

1.  Make the needed manual corrections to the rows in the publication tables across all primary nodes to get them into an initial, consistent state so each publication table has the same set of identical rows across primary nodes. This might be to a state before the conflicting transactions occurred, depending on what you determine to be the easiest course of action for fully resolving the conflict.

1.  Apply or reapply transactions (either from your application or from the shadow tables) so that all publication tables across all primary nodes are updated consistently according to the desired, expected result of what was recorded in the shadow tables.

1.  In the shadow tables, update certain indicators for conflicting entries to verify that they were resolved.

1.  In the control schema, update certain indicators for the conflicting entries to show that these conflicts were resolved. This update changes the Resolution Status of these entries to Resolved in the **Conflict History** tab. These entries no longer appear in the SQL query described in [Finding conflicts](01_find_conflict/#find_conflict).

     Perform these updates to the control schema of the controller database. You can determine the currently designated controller database from the content of the Replication Server configuration file (see [Replication Server configuration file](../../../02_overview/03_replication_server_components_and_architecture/01_physical_components/#xdb_replication_conf_file)). The publication server ensures that the control schema changes made on the controller database are replicated to the control schemas of all publication databases. This mechanism maintains metadata consistency across all publication databases.

1.  Resume operating your replication system. Start the publication server and recreate the replication schedule if you were using one.

To acheive the first two steps, use some combination of the following methods. The methods you use depend on the state of your publication tables and the extent of pending transactions that need to be applied from the shadow tables.

-   **Manual publication table correction.** Use a utility such as PSQL or pgAdmin (Postgres Enterprise Manager Client in Advanced Server) to manually correct the rows in the publication tables across all primary nodes without replicating these changes. Use the database user with `session_replication_role` set to `replica` for this purpose.
-   **Correction using new transactions.** Rerun your application on one primary node to create new transactions that can replicate to all other primary nodes. Use this method after you ensure that all publication tables are in a consistent state across all primary nodes.
-   **Correction using shadow table transactions.** Force the synchronization of transactions already recorded in the shadow tables. Use this method if many shadow table transactions need to be applied and it's simpler to force the synchronization of these transactions rather than reissuing the transactions from your application.

### Example replication environment

In the examples that follow, the following replication environment is used.

-   A three-node multi-master replication system is established. The primary node names are `MMRnode_a` (the primary definition node and the controller database), `MMRnode_b`, and `MMRnode_c`.
-   The publication is named `emp_pub` and uses dept and emp tables.
-   The conflict used to show the first two conflict resolution methods is a uniqueness conflict occurring on the dept table on primary key column `deptno` on value 50. This conflict resulted from the `INSERT` statements shown by the following:

On `MMRnode_a`, the following statement is run:

```sql
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50, 'FINANCE', 'CHICAGO');
```

On `MMRnode_b`, the following statement is run:

```sql
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50, 'MARKETING', 'LOS ANGELES');
```

A synchronization replication is then performed.

The following is the content of table dept on `MMRnode_a`:

```sql
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM dept;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | FINANCE    | CHICAGO
(5 rows)
```

The following is the content of table dept on `MMRnode_b`:

```sql
MMRnode_b=# SELECT * FROM dept;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

The following is the content of table dept on `MMRnode_c`:

```sql
MMRnode_c=# SELECT * FROM dept;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
(4 rows)
```

The **Conflict History** tab shows the following entry:

The following is the output from the SQL query described in [Finding conflicts](01_find_conflict/#find_conflict).

```

## Manual publication table correction

The first step in all manual conflict resolutions is to ensure all publication tables are consistent across all primary nodes. That is, all corresponding tables have the same rows with the same column values.

After that, you can then reapply transactions that failed to replicate successfully.

Using the example from [Correction strategies](#example-replication-environment), the inconsistencies are the following:

-   Primary nodes `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_b` each contain a row with primary key value `50`, but the other column values in the row are different.
-   Primary node `MMRnode_c` doesn't have a row with primary key value `50`.

Assuming that the correct state of the dept table is the one in `MMRnode_b`, the following options are available to correct the state of all primary nodes:

-   Manually correct the dept table in `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_c`. That is, update the row in `MMRnode_a` so it has the correct values, and insert the missing row in `MMRnode_c`. The dept table on all nodes is now consistent and up to date.
-   Manually delete the row with primary key value `50` from the table on both `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_b`. This brings the dept table on all primary nodes back to a prior, consistent state. Then, with the multi-master replication system running, perform the insert transaction again using the correct column values on any one of the primary nodes.
-   Manually delete the incorrect row with primary key value `50` from the table on `MMRnode_a`. Leave the correct row in the table in `MMRnode_b`. This simulates the state where the correct transaction was run on `MMRnode_b`, is recorded in the shadow table, but has not yet been replicated, and the incorrect transaction was never run on `MMRnode_a`. Update the shadow table entry in `MMRnode_a` to indicate that it is discarded and to ensure it isn't included in any future synchronizations. Update the metadata for the shadow table entry in `MMRnode_b` to force its inclusion in the next synchronization. Perform a synchronization replication so the accepted shadow table entry in `MMRnode_b` is replicated to `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_c`.

After the publication table rows are corrected, update the appropriate control schema table in the publication database currently designated as the controller database to indicate that the conflict has been resolved.

### Step 1
Manually correct the rows in the publication tables with `session_replication_role` set to `replica`. On `MMRnode_a`, correct the erroneous row:

```sql
MMRnode_a=# SHOW session_replication_role;
__OUTPUT__
session_replication_role
--------------------------
replica
(1 row)
```
```sql
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM dept;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | FINANCE    | CHICAGO
(5 rows)
```
```sql
MMRnode_a=# UPDATE dept SET dname = 'MARKETING', loc = 'LOS ANGELES' WHERE deptno = 50;
UPDATE 1
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM dept ORDER BY deptno;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

On `MMRnode_c`, insert the missing row:

```sql
MMRnode_c=# SHOW session_replication_role;
__OUTPUT__
 session_replication_role
--------------------------
 replica
(1 row)
```
```sql
MMRnode_c=# INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50, 'MARKETING', 'LOS ANGELES');
INSERT 0 1
MMRnode_c=# SELECT * FROM dept ORDER BY deptno;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

The dept table on `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_c` now match the content of the table on `MMRnode_b`:

```sql
MMRnode_b=# SELECT * FROM dept ORDER BY deptno;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

### Step 2

Update the shadow table entries for the conflicting transactions in the primary nodes to indicate that the conflict was resolved. In each primary node where a transaction occurred that's involved in the conflict, inspect the shadow table for the publication table in question. Shadow tables are located in each primary node in schema `_edb_replicator_pub`. Shadow tables follow the naming convention `rrst_schema_table` where `schema` is the name of the schema containing the publication table and `table` is the name of the publication table.

Note the following points regarding shadow tables:

-   A row in a shadow table corresponds to an `INSERT, UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement that's applied to the corresponding publication tables in the other primary nodes. A shadow table row doesn't necessarily correspond to the SQL statement issued by the user application. For example, a SQL statement issued by a user application that includes a `WHERE` clause using a range such as greater than or less than results in multiple, individual entries in the shadow table for each row in the result set of the application’s SQL statement.
-   The primary key of a shadow table is a program-generated positive integer in `column rrep_sync_id`. The `rrep_sync_id` values are unique among all shadow tables in a given primary node. Therefore, the `rrep_sync_id` values for conflicting transactions might not have the same value across primary nodes. This depends on how many prior transactions were recorded in the shadow tables of each primary node.
-   A shadow table entry for a transaction involved in a conflict that wasn't yet resolved contains a value of `P` (pending) in column `rrep_tx_conflict_status`. If a transaction isn't involved in a conflict, this column is set to null. (Most shadow table entries have null in this column.) If a transaction was involved in a conflict that was resolved automatically by the publication server, and this transaction was accepted as correct, this column contains `C` (complete/accepted). If a transaction was involved in a conflict that was resolved automatically, and this transaction was deemed incorrect, this column contains `D` (discarded).

To find the shadow table entries involved in a conflict, use the **Conflict History** tab in the Replication Server console or the SQL query described in [Finding conflicts](../10_manual_conflict_resolution_log_based_method/01_finding_conflict/#finding_conflict) and shown by the following output:

```text
-[ RECORD 1 ]-------+----------------------------------------------------------------
conflict_type       | II
table_name          | dept
pk_value            | deptno=50
src_db_host         | 192.168.2.22
src_db_port         | 5444
src_db_name         | MMRnode_a
src_rrep_sync_id    | 2
target_db_host      | 192.168.2.22
target_db_port      | 5444
target_db_name      | MMRnode_b
target_rrep_sync_id | 0
notes               | ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "dept_pk"
                    |   Detail: Key (deptno)=(50) already exists.
-[ RECORD 2 ]-------+----------------------------------------------------------------
conflict_type       | II
table_name          | dept
pk_value            | deptno=50
src_db_host         | 192.168.2.22
src_db_port         | 5444
src_db_name         | MMRnode_b
src_rrep_sync_id    | 1
target_db_host      | 192.168.2.22
target_db_port      | 5444
target_db_name      | MMRnode_a
target_rrep_sync_id | 0
notes               | ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "dept_pk"
                    |   Detail: Key (deptno)=(50) already exists.
```

You can then query the shadow table in the desired primary node on its `rrep_sync_id` value.

The following query is performed on the shadow table for the dept table in `MMRnode_a` on `rrep_sync_id` value 2 obtained from field `src_rrep_sync_id` of RECORD 1 in the preceding output.

```sql
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM _edb_replicator_pub.rrst_edb_dept WHERE rrep_sync_id = 2;
__OUTPUT__
-[ RECORD 1 ]-----------+--------------------------
rrep_sync_id            | 2
rrep_common_id          |
rrep_operation_type     | I
rrep_tx_timestamp       | 25-AUG-15 11:39:35.590648
deptno                  | 50
dname                   | FINANCE
loc                     | CHICAGO
rrep_old_deptno         |
rrep_old_dname          |
rrep_old_loc            |
rrep_tx_conflict_status | P
```

A similar query can locate the pending shadow table entry in `MMRnode_b` by querying on the key value obtained from field `src_rep_sync_id: of RECORD 2:`

```sql
MMRnode_b=# SELECT * FROM _edb_replicator_pub.rrst_edb_dept WHERE rrep_sync_id = 1;
__OUTPUT__
-[ RECORD 1 ]-----------+--------------------------
rrep_sync_id            | 1
rrep_common_id          |
rrep_operation_type     | I
rrep_tx_timestamp       | 25-AUG-15 11:39:57.980469
deptno                  | 50
dname                   | MARKETING
loc                     | LOS ANGELES
rrep_old_deptno         |
rrep_old_dname          |
rrep_old_loc            |
rrep_tx_conflict_status | P
```

!!! Note
    To be certain no pending transactions are overlooked, examine the shadow tables in all primary nodes that might be involved in the conflict, and search for entries where `rrep_tx_conflict_status` is set to `P`.

The following shows the `rrep_tx_conflict_status` column marked `P` (pending) in the Postgres Enterprise Manager Client.

![Shadow table entry with pending conflict](../../../images/image146.png)

Modify column `rrep_tx_conflict_status` by changing the value to `D` (discarded) to show that the pending conflict was resolved. A value of `D` also ensures that the shadow table entry isn't replicated during any future synchronization replications.

Make this change to the shadow tables in both `MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_b`.

![Discarded shadow table entry](../../../images/image147.png)

Be sure to qualify the row with the correct `rrep_sync_id` value if you perform the update using a SQL statement such as in the following:

```sql
UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.rrst_edb_dept SET rrep_tx_conflict_status = 'D' WHERE rrep_sync_id = 1;
```

There's no shadow table entry in `MMRnode_c`, since an insert transaction wasn't performed in that primary node by the application.

### Step 3

In the control schema of the publication database currently designated as the controller database, modify the entries in the `xdb_conflicts table` to indicate the conflict was resolved. Table `xdb_conflicts` is located in schema `_edb_replicator_pub`.

!!! Note
    The entries in table xdb_conflicts affect only the data that appears in the **Conflict History** tab and the SQL query described in [Finding conflicts](../10_manual_conflict_resolution_log_based_method/01_finding_conflict/#finding_conflict). Changing entries in `xdb_conflicts` has no effect on future replication operations but provides a way to keep a record of how past conflicts were resolved.

Note the following points regarding the `xdb_conflicts` table:

-   A row in the `xdb_conflicts` table appears as an entry in the **Conflict History** tab.
-   The primary key of the `xdb_conflicts table` is made up of columns `src_db_id`, `target_db_id`, `src_rrep_sync_id`, and `target_rrep_sync_id`. Column `src_db_id` contains a unique identifier for the primary node in which a transaction occurred that results in a conflict when replicated to the primary node identified by `target_db_id`. `src_rrep_sync_id` is the shadow table identifier of the transaction on the source primary node involved in the conflict, while `target_rrep_sync_id` is the shadow table identifier of the transaction on the target primary node involved in the conflict. For uniqueness (insert/insert) conflicts, the `target_rrep_sync_id` value is always set to `0`. For a given uniqueness conflict, there are two entries in the `xdb_conflicts table`. The `src_rrep_sync_id` value in each of the two entries corresponds to the shadow table identifiers. One is for the shadow table identifier associated with the source primary node. The other is for the shadow table identifier associated with the target primary node.
-   Table `xdb_pub_database` in the control schema associates the database identifiers `src_db_id` and `target_db_id` with the primary node attributes such as the database name, IP address, and port.
-   Column `table_id` is the identifier of the publication table on which the conflict occurred. Association of the `table_id` value with the publication table attributes such as its name, schema, and shadow table is found in each primary node in `_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_tables`.
-   For uniqueness (insert/insert) conflicts only, column `pk_value` contains text indicating the primary key value that resulted in the conflict. The text is formatted as `column_name=value`. If the primary key is made up of two or more columns, each column and value pair is separated by the keyword AND, such as `column_1=value_1 AND column_2=value_2`. This provides the primary key of the row in the publication table designated by `table_id` that resulted in the conflict. Only uniqueness (insert/insert) conflicts contain the `column_name=value` text in the `pk_value` column. The `pk_value` column is null for all other conflict types (that is, update/update, delete/update, update/delete, and delete/delete conflicts).
-   Column `resolution_status` indicates the status of the conflict. Possible values are `P` (pending) or `C` (completed, that is the conflict was resolved). This status appears in the Resolution Status column of the **Conflict History** tab.
-   You can use the column `win_db_id` to record the database identifier of the primary node that contains the winning (accepted) transaction. This information appears in the Winning DB column of the **Conflict History** tab.
-   You can use column `win_rrep_sync_id` to record the shadow table identifier of the winning transaction.

The following shows the **Conflict History** tab prior to updating the `xdb_conflicts` table.

![Pending uniqueness conflict](../../../images/image145.png)

You can find the conflict entry for synchronization from `MMRnode_a` to `MMRnode_b` in `xdb_conflicts` with the following query for this example:

```sql
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts
MMRnode_a-#   WHERE src_db_id = 1
MMRnode_a-#     AND target_db_id = 4
MMRnode_a-#     AND src_rrep_sync_id = 2
MMRnode_a-#     AND target_rrep_sync_id = 0;
__OUTPUT__
-[ RECORD 1 ]-------+----------------------------------------------------------------
src_db_id           | 1
target_db_id        | 4
src_rrep_sync_id    | 2
target_rrep_sync_id | 0
table_id            | 31
conflict_time       | 25-AUG-15 10:40:23.685738
resolution_status   | P
resolution_strategy |
resolution_time     |
alert_status        |
conflict_type       | II
win_db_id           | 0
win_rrep_sync_id    | 0
notes               | ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "dept_pk"
                    |   Detail: Key (deptno)=(50) already exists.
 pk_value            | deptno=50
```

You can find the conflict entry for synchronization from `MMRnode_b` to `MMRnode_a` in xdb_conflicts with the following query for this example:

```sql
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts
MMRnode_a-#   WHERE src_db_id = 4
MMRnode_a-#     AND target_db_id = 1
MMRnode_a-#     AND src_rrep_sync_id = 1
MMRnode_a-#     AND target_rrep_sync_id = 0;
__OUTPUT__
-[ RECORD 1 ]-------+----------------------------------------------------------------
src_db_id           | 4
target_db_id        | 1
src_rrep_sync_id    | 1
target_rrep_sync_id | 0
table_id            | 31
conflict_time       | 25-AUG-15 10:40:23.726889
resolution_status   | P
resolution_strategy |
resolution_time     |
alert_status        |
conflict_type       | II
win_db_id           | 0
win_rrep_sync_id    | 0
notes               | ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "dept_pk"
                   |   Detail: Key (deptno)=(50) already exists.
pk_value            | deptno=50
```

For uniqueness (insert/insert) conflicts only, you can use the following query to display both of the preceding entries:

```sql

These entries appear in the Postgres Enterprise Manager Client.

Change the value in column `resolution_status` from `P` (pending) to `C` (completed) to indicate this conflict was resolved. The value in `winning_db_id` changes to `4` to indicate primary node `MMRnode_b` contains the winning transaction. The value in `winning_rrep_sync_id` changes to the value of `rrep_sync_id` for the shadow table entry of the transaction in `MMRnode_b`, since this is the one deemed correct.

The SQL statement to perform this update for the `MMRnode_a` to the `MMRnode_b` synchronization conflict is the following:

```sql
UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts SET
  resolution_status = 'C',
  win_db_id = 4,
  win_rrep_sync_id = 1
WHERE src_db_id = 1
  AND target_db_id = 4
  AND src_rrep_sync_id = 2
  AND target_rrep_sync_id = 0;
```

The SQL statement to perform this update for the `MMRnode_b` to the `MMRnode_a` synchronization conflict is the following:

```sql
UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts SET
  resolution_status = 'C',
  win_db_id = 4,
  win_rrep_sync_id = 1
WHERE src_db_id = 4
  AND target_db_id = 1
  AND src_rrep_sync_id = 1
  AND target_rrep_sync_id = 0;
```

For uniqueness (insert/insert) conflicts only, you can use the following SQL statement to update both of the preceding entries at the same time:

```sql
UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts SET
  resolution_status = 'C',
  win_db_id = 4,
  win_rrep_sync_id = 1
WHERE pk_value = 'deptno=50'
  AND conflict_type = 'II'
  AND resolution_status = 'P';
```

The following are the updated xdb_conflicts entries:

![Resolved conflict in xdb_conflicts](../../../images/image149.png)

When viewed in the **Conflict History** tab, the entries now show Resolved instead of Pending in the Resolution Status column, and the Winning DB column shows the address of primary node `MMRnode_b`.

## Correction using new transactions

You can bring all the publication tables to a consistent state by removing any changes caused by the conflicting transactions. Then issue new, corrected transactions at one primary node, which you allow the multi-master replication system to synchronize to all other primary nodes.

Referring back to the uniqueness conflict on the dept table, instead of correcting the erroneous row and inserting the row into the primary node where it is missing as described in [Manual publication table correction](#manual-publication-table-correction), you can delete the conflicting rows from all primary nodes and then insert the correct row in one primary node and let the multi-master replication system synchronize the correct row to all primary nodes.

### Step 1

Manually delete the inserted row from the publication tables in all primary nodes with `session_replication_role` set to `replica`.

On `MMRnode_a`, delete the erroneous row:

```sql
MMRnode_a=# SHOW session_replication_role;
__OUTPUT__
 session_replication_role
--------------------------
 replica
(1 row)


  MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM dept;
   deptno |   dname    |   loc
  --------+------------+----------
       10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
       20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
       30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
       40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
       50 | FINANCE    | CHICAGO
  (5 rows)
```
```sql
MMRnode_a=# DELETE FROM dept WHERE deptno = 50;
DELETE 1
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM dept;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
(4 rows)
```

On `MMRnode_b`, delete the row even though the transaction created the correct result:

```sql
MMRnode_b=# SHOW session_replication_role;
__OUTPUT__
 session_replication_role
--------------------------
 replica
(1 row)
```
```sql
MMRnode_b=# SELECT * FROM dept;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```
```sql
MMRnode_b=# DELETE FROM dept WHERE deptno = 50;
DELETE 1
MMRnode_b=# SELECT * FROM dept;
__OUTPUT__
deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
   10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
   20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
   30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
   40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
(4 rows)
```

On `MMRnode_c`, no changes are required as the conflicting transaction didn't insert a new row into the table on this node:

```sql
MMRnode_c=# SET search_path TO edb;
SET
MMRnode_c=# SELECT * FROM dept;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
(4 rows)
```

### Step 2 

Rerun the transaction on one primary node with the multi-master replication system running and with `session_replication_role` set to the default (`origin`).

For this example, the correct `INSERT` statement is executed on `MMRnode_a`:

```sql
MMRnode_a=# SHOW session_replication_role;
__OUTPUT__
 session_replication_role
--------------------------
 origin
(1 row)
```
```sql
MMRnode_a=# INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50, 'MARKETING', 'LOS ANGELES');
INSERT 0 1
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM dept;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

### Step 3

Perform synchronization replication.

The same rows now appear in the publication table on all primary nodes. On `MMRnode_a`:

```sql
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM dept;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

On `MMRnode_b`:

```sql
MMRnode_b=# SELECT * FROM dept;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

On `MMRnode_c`:

```sql
MMRnode_c=# SELECT * FROM dept;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |   dname    |     loc
--------+------------+-------------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     50 | MARKETING  | LOS ANGELES
(5 rows)
```

### Step 4

Update the shadow table entries for the conflicting transactions in the primary nodes to indicate that the conflict was resolved as in Step 2 of [Manual publication table correction](#manual-publication-table-correction).

Change the `rrep_tx_conflict_status` column from `P` (pending) to `D` (discarded) on all primary nodes.

!!! Note
    The second entry for the accepted transaction you ran in Step 2, where `rrep_tx_conflict_status` is set to null, indicates there was no conflict.

There's no shadow table entry in `MMRnode_c`, since an insert transaction wasn't performed in that primary node by the application.

### Step 5

In the control schema of the publication database currently designated as the controller database, modify the entries in the `xdb_conflicts` table to indicate the conflict was resolved as in Step 3 of [Manual publication table correction](#manual-publication-table-correction).

## Correction using shadow table transactions

You can bring all publication tables to a consistent state is by removing changes caused by the conflicting transactions. You then modify the publication table’s metadata in such a way that the next synchronization results in the replication of transactions already stored in the shadow tables.

Such transactions might not have successfully replicated to all the other primary nodes in a prior synchronization for various reasons.

The following is an example of such a case:

-   Applications on two primary nodes insert rows with the same primary key value. This results in a uniqueness conflict when synchronization replication occurs.
-   Following the insert on one primary node, the application continues to apply updates to the newly inserted row. These updates are successfully applied to the row on this primary node and are recorded in the shadow table on this node.
-   Synchronization replication is performed.
-   Since there is a uniqueness conflict, the rows with the conflicting primary key value aren't replicated into the publication tables on the other primary nodes.
-   However, the conflicting row on the primary node that wasn't directly updated receives those update transactions by the replication, resulting in possibly inconsistent, updated rows on the two primary nodes.

Two options are: 
-  Manually insert the missing row into the other primary nodes and manually change the incorrect row. 
-  Rerun the application to reapply the correct insert and updates. 

However, the following option provides a way to reapply the transactions already recorded in the shadow table of the winning primary node.

The example used to illustrate this method is based upon the following transactions on the emp table.

In `MMRnode_b`, the following row is inserted:

```sql
INSERT INTO emp (empno,ename,job,deptno) VALUES (9001,'SMITH','ANALYST',20);
```

In `MMRnode_c`, the following row is inserted with the same primary key value 9001 in the `empno` column:

```sql
INSERT INTO emp (empno,ename,job,deptno) VALUES (9001,'JONES','SALESMAN',30);
In MMRnode_c, this is followed by a series of updates to the newly inserted row:
UPDATE emp SET mgr = 7698 WHERE empno = 9001;
UPDATE emp SET sal = 9500 WHERE empno = 9001;
UPDATE emp SET comm = 5000 WHERE empno = 9001;
```

Synchronization replication is performed. The resulting content of the `emp` table is as follows:

On `MMRnode_a` the conflicting row has not been replicated:

```sql
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM emp;
__OUTPUT__
 empno | ename  |    job    | mgr  |      hiredate      |   sal   |  comm   | deptno

(15 rows)
```

In this example, it is assumed that the desired, correct row is on `MMRnode_c`.

The following are the steps to reproduce the correct row, currently on `MMRnode_c`, to the other primary nodes by synchronizing the shadow table entries that resulted from the original insert and updates to this row on `MMRnode_c`.

### Step 1

Manually delete the inserted row from the publication tables on all primary nodes except for `MMRnode_c`, which has the correct row. Be sure `session_replication_role` is set to `replica`.

On `MMRnode_a`, this row does not exist:

```sql
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno = 9001;
__OUTPUT__
 empno | ename | job | mgr | hiredate | sal | comm | deptno
-------+-------+-----+-----+----------+-----+------+--------
(0 rows)
```

On `MMRnode_b`, delete the erroneous row:

```sql
MMRnode_a=# SHOW session_replication_role;
__OUTPUT__
 session_replication_role
--------------------------
 replica
(1 row)
```
```sql
MMRnode_b=# DELETE FROM emp WHERE empno = 9001;
DELETE 1
```

On `MMRnode_c`, leave the correct, accepted row intact:

```sql
MMRnode_c=# SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno = 9001;
__OUTPUT__
 empno | ename |   job    | mgr  | hiredate |   sal   |  comm   | deptno
-------+-------+----------+------+----------+---------+---------+--------
  9001 | JONES | SALESMAN | 7698 |          | 9500.00 | 5000.00 |     30
(1 row)
```

### Step 2

On the primary nodes containing the conflicting row to discard, mark the shadow table entry for that row as discarded. This mark indicates the conflict on this row was resolved and ensures this shadow table entry isn't replicated in the future.

Change the `rrep_tx_conflict_status` column from `P` (pending) to `D` (discarded) on the losing node, `MMRnode_b`.

### Step 3

On winning node `MMRnode_c`, inspect the shadow table for the emp publication table.

The objective is to use the shadow table entries for the insert and three update transactions that were previously run on this node to replicate to the other primary nodes during the next synchronization.

The left-most columns of the shadow table appear as follows:

![Shadow table with multiple transactions](../../../images/image155.png)

Make note of the `rrep_sync_id` values for these four entries, which are `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` in this example.

The following shows the right-most columns of the shadow table from the figure. Note the contents of column `rrep_tx_conflict_status` furthest to the right.

![Shadow table with multiple transactions (continued)](../../../images/image156.png)

Make sure the `rrep_tx_conflict_status` column is null for these four entries. In this case, for the insert transaction, you need to change the `P` (pending) value to null.

The resulting change for the `rrep_tx_conflict_status` column in the shadow table on `MMRnode_c` is shown by the following:

![Shadow table transactions set to replicate](../../../images/image157.png)

### Step 4

To replicate these four shadow table entries during the next synchronization, you must add one or more entries to the control schema table `_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset` on `MMRnode_c` to indicate pending status for synchronization to the target primary nodes (`MMRnode_a` and `MMRnode_b`) of the four shadow table entries. These shadow table entries are identified by the `rrep_sync_id` values of `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` noted in Step 3.

First, you must identify the `pub_id` and target `db_id` values to associate with the pending transactions. To do so, invoke the following query, substituting the `rrep_sync_id` values for `sync_id` in the query:

```sql
SELECT pub_id, db_id AS target_db_id
  FROM _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset
  WHERE start_rrep_sync_id <= sync_id
    AND end_rrep_sync_id >= sync_id;
```

In this example, there are four values to substitute for `sync_id`, which are `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`.

The results are the following:

```sql
MMRnode_c=# SELECT pub_id, db_id AS target_db_id
MMRnode_c-#   FROM _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset
MMRnode_c-#   WHERE start_rrep_sync_id <= 1 AND end_rrep_sync_id >= 1;
__OUTPUT__
 pub_id | target_db_id
--------+--------------
      3 |            1
      3 |            4
(2 rows)
```
```sql
MMRnode_c=# SELECT pub_id, db_id AS target_db_id
MMRnode_c-#   FROM _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset
MMRnode_c-#   WHERE start_rrep_sync_id <= 2 AND end_rrep_sync_id >= 2;
__OUTPUT__
 pub_id | target_db_id
--------+--------------
      3 |            1
      3 |            4
(2 rows)
```
```sql 
MMRnode_c=# SELECT pub_id, db_id AS target_db_id
MMRnode_c-#   FROM _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset
MMRnode_c-#   WHERE start_rrep_sync_id <= 3 AND end_rrep_sync_id >= 3;
__OUTPUT__
 pub_id | target_db_id
--------+--------------
      3 |            1
      3 |            4
(2 rows)
```
```sql
MMRnode_c=# SELECT pub_id, db_id AS target_db_id
MMRnode_c-#   FROM _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset
MMRnode_c-#   WHERE start_rrep_sync_id <= 4 AND end_rrep_sync_id >= 4;
__OUTPUT__
 pub_id | target_db_id
--------+--------------
      3 |            1
      3 |            4
(2 rows)
```

The results indicate that the previously executed synchronization that attempted to apply the shadow table transactions identified by the `rrep_sync_id` values of `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4` were all for the publication identified by `pub_id` of `3`. The target primary nodes were identified by `db_id` of `1` (for `MMRnode_a`) and `db_id` of `4` (for `MMRnode_b`).

Thus, you must insert at least two entries into the control schema table `_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset` on `MMRnode_c`. At least one entry is required for the target `db_id` of `1` and at least one entry for the target `db_id` of `4`.

Each entry in `_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset` consists of a range of `rrep_sync_id` values (identified by columns `start_rrep_sync_id` and `end_rrep_sync_id`). The desired shadow table `rrep_sync_id` values happen to be contiguous (1 through 4). Thus a single entry can encompass the four `rrep_sync_id` values for a single target database.

In this example, you can add a total of two entries to `_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset`, one for each target database.

!!! Note
    When multiple, noncontiguous `rrep_sync_id` values are required for synchronization (for example, `1`, `2`, `5`, and `6`), multiple entries are required for each target database. The entries specify `rrep_sync_id` ranges to collectively cover all of the noncontiguous values but omitting `rrep_sync_id` values not included in the synchronization (for example, one entry for 1 through 2 and a second entry for 5 through 6).

### Step 5

Insert the entries into the `_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset` control schema table identified in the preceding step.

The two `INSERT` statements invoked on `MMRnode_c` are the following:

```sql
INSERT INTO _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset (set_id, pub_id, db_id, status, start_rrep_sync_id, end_rrep_sync_id)
  values (nextval('_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_txset_seq'),3,1,'P',1,4);

INSERT INTO _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset (set_id, pub_id, db_id, status, start_rrep_sync_id, end_rrep_sync_id)
  values (nextval('_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_txset_seq'),3,4,'P',1,4);
```

A query of the \_edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset metadata table displays the following:

```sql
MMRnode_c=# SELECT set_id, pub_id, db_id AS target_db_id, status,
MMRnode_c-#     start_rrep_sync_id, end_rrep_sync_id
MMRnode_c-#   FROM _edb_replicator_pub.rrep_MMR_txset;
__OUTPUT__
 set_id | pub_id | target_db_id | status | start_rrep_sync_id | end_rrep_sync_id
--------+--------+--------------+--------+--------------------+------------------
      1 |      3 |            1 | C      |                  1 |                4
      1 |      3 |            4 | C      |                  1 |                4
      2 |      3 |            1 | P      |                  1 |                4
      3 |      3 |            4 | P      |                  1 |                4
(4 rows)
```

There are now two new entries with pending status: one for target `db_id` 1, the other for target `db_id` 4. Both entries cover the `rrep_sync_id` range of 1 through 4.

The two entries with completed status are from the synchronization attempt that first produced the conflict.

### Step 6

Perform synchronization replication.

The insert and three update transactions recorded in the `rrst_edb_emp` shadow table on `MMRnode_c` are replicated to the other primary nodes.

```sql
On MMRnode_a:
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno = 9001;
__OUTPUT__
 empno | ename |   job    | mgr  | hiredate |   sal   |  comm   | deptno
-------+-------+----------+------+----------+---------+---------+--------
  9001 | JONES | SALESMAN | 7698 |          | 9500.00 | 5000.00 |     30
(1 row)
```
```sql
On MMRnode_b:
MMRnode_b=# SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno = 9001;
__OUTPUT__
 empno | ename |   job    | mgr  | hiredate |   sal   |  comm   | deptno
-------+-------+----------+------+----------+---------+---------+--------
  9001 | JONES | SALESMAN | 7698 |          | 9500.00 | 5000.00 |     30
(1 row)
```

These rows now match the row created by the original transactions on `MMRnode_c`:

```sql
MMRnode_c=# SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno = 9001;
__OUTPUT__
 empno | ename |   job    | mgr  | hiredate |   sal   |  comm   | deptno
-------+-------+----------+------+----------+---------+---------+--------
  9001 | JONES | SALESMAN | 7698 |          | 9500.00 | 5000.00 |     30
(1 row)
```

### Step 7

In the control schema of the publication database currently designated as the controller database, modify the entries in the xdb_conflicts table to indicate the conflict was resolved as in Step 3 of [Manual publication table correction](#manual-publication-table-correction).

For a uniqueness (insert/insert) conflict only, the following query on the `xdb_conflicts` table in the controller database can display the conflicts:

```sql
MMRnode_a=# SELECT * FROM _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts
MMRnode_a-#   WHERE pk_value = 'empno=9001'
MMRnode_a-#     AND conflict_type = 'II'
MMRnode_a-#     AND resolution_status = 'P';
__OUTPUT__
-[ RECORD 1 ]-------+---------------------------------------------------------------
src_db_id           | 4
target_db_id        | 56
src_rrep_sync_id    | 1
target_rrep_sync_id | 0
table_id            | 32
conflict_time       | 25-AUG-15 15:27:20.928679
resolution_status   | P

resolution_time     |
alert_status        |
conflict_type       | II
win_db_id           | 0
win_rrep_sync_id    | 0
notes               | ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "emp_pk"
                    |   Detail: Key (empno)=(9001) already exists.
pk_value            | empno=9001
-[ RECORD 2 ]-------+---------------------------------------------------------------
src_db_id           | 56
target_db_id        | 4
src_rrep_sync_id    | 1
target_rrep_sync_id | 0
table_id            | 32
conflict_time       | 25-AUG-15 15:27:20.970959
resolution_status   | P
resolution_strategy |
resolution_time     |
alert_status        |
conflict_type       | II
win_db_id           | 0
win_rrep_sync_id    | 0
notes               | ERROR: duplicate key value violates unique constraint "emp_pk"
                    |   Detail: Key (empno)=(9001) already exists.
pk_value            | empno=9001
```

The following SQL statement changes the value in column `resolution_status` from `P` (pending) to `C` (completed) to indicate this conflict was resolved. The value in `winning_db_id` changes to `56` to indicate primary node `MMRnode_c` contains the winning transaction. The value in `winning_rrep_sync_id` is changed to the value of `rrep_sync_id` for the shadow table entry of the `INSERT` transaction in `MMRnode_c`, since this is the correct one.

```sql
UPDATE _edb_replicator_pub.xdb_conflicts SET
  resolution_status = 'C',
  win_db_id = 56,
  win_rrep_sync_id = 1
WHERE pk_value = 'empno=9001'
  AND conflict_type = 'II'
  AND resolution_status = 'P';
```

When viewed in the **Conflict History** tab, the entry now shows Resolved in the Resolution Status column, and the Winning DB column shows the address of primary node `MMRnode_c`.
