In a geographically dispersed application, you can provide local access to the database to regions of clients. Having the database servers physically close to clients can reduce latency with the database. Multi-master replication allows you to use a WAN-connected network of primary databases that can be geographically close to groups of clients yet maintain data consistency across primary databases.
