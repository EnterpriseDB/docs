EDB provides a graphical interactive installer for Windows. You can access it two ways:

- Download the graphical installer from the [Downloads page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/software-downloads-postgres#replication-server) and invoke the installer directly. See [Installing directly](/eprs/latest/installing/windows/#installing-directly).

- Use Stack Builder (with PostgreSQL) or StackBuilder Plus (with EDB Postgres Advanced Server) to download the EDB installer package and invoke the graphical installer.  See [Using Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus](/eprs/latest/installing/windows/#using-stack-builder-or-stackbuilder-plus).


## Prerequisites

- You must have Java Runtime Environment (JRE) version 1.8 or later installed on the hosts where you intend to install any Replication Server component (Replication Console, publication server, or subscription server). Any Java product such as Oracle Java or OpenJDK may be used. Follow the directions for your host operating system to install the Java runtime environment.

- Be sure the system environment variable, `JAVA_HOME`, is set to the JRE installation directory of the JRE version and bitness (32-bit or 64-bit) you want to use with Replication Server. The Replication Server installer for a Windows platform contains both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions. The `JAVA_HOME` setting determines whether the 32-bit or the 64-bit version of Replication Server is installed. If `JAVA_HOME` is not set, the first JRE version encountered in the Path system environment variable determines the Replication Server version to be installed.


## Installing directly

After downloading the graphical installer, to start the installation wizard, assume sufficient privileges (superuser or administrator) and double-click the installer icon. If prompted, provide a password.

In some versions of Windows, to invoke the installer with Administrator privileges, you need to right-click on the installer icon and select **Run as Administrator** from the context menu.

Proceed to the [Using the graphical installer](#using-the-graphical-installer) section.

## Using Stack Builder or StackBuilder Plus

If you are using PostgreSQL, you can invoke the graphical installer with Stack Builder. See [Using Stack Builder](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/supported-open-source/postgresql/installer/03_using_stackbuilder/). 

1. In Stack Builder, follow the prompts until you get to the module selection page.

1. Expand the **Registration-required and trial products** node. 

1. Expand the **EnterpriseDB Tools** node and select **Replication Server**. 

1. Proceed to the [Using the graphical installer](#using-the-graphical-installer) section in this topic.

If you are using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you can invoke the graphical installer with StackBuilder Plus. See [Using StackBuilder Plus](/epas/latest/epas_inst_windows/installing_advanced_server_with_the_interactive_installer/using_stackbuilder_plus/). 

1. In StackBuilder Plus, follow the prompts until you get to the module selection page. 

1. Expand the **EnterpriseDB Tools** node and select **Replication Server**. 

1. Proceed to the [Using the graphical installer](#using-the-graphical-installer) section in this topic.

## Using the graphical installer 

1. Select the installation language and select **OK**.

1. On the Setup Replication Server page, select **Next**.

1. Read the license agreement. If you accept the agreement, select the **I accept the agreement** option and select **Next**.

1. Browse to a directory where you want the Replication Server components to be installed, or allow the installer to install the components in the default location. Select **Next**.

1. If you do not want a particular Replication Server component installed, uncheck the box next to the component name. Select **Next**.

1. Enter information for the Replication Server administrator.

   !!! Note
       From this point on, we suggest you record the values you enter as they will be needed during the publication and subscription server registration process.

   Enter values for the following fields:

    -   **Admin User** &mdash; The Replication Server administrator user name needed to authenticate some Replication Server actions such as registering a publication server or subscription server running on this host. Any alphanumeric string may be entered for the admin user name. The default admin user name is *admin*.

   -   **Admin Password** &mdash; Password of your choice for the Replication Server administrator.

   The admin user and the admin password (in encrypted form) are saved to the `XDB_HOME\etc\edb-repl.conf` configuration file. Select **Next**.

1. If a publication server is being installed, enter an available port on which the publication server can run. The default port number is *9051*. Select **Next**.

1. If a subscription server is being installed, enter an available port on which the subscription server can run. The default port number is *9052*. Select **Next**.

1. If you are using EDB Postgres Advanced Server installed in Oracle compatible configuration mode, enter `postgres` or `enterprisedb` for the operating system account under which the publication server or subscription server runs.

1. On the Ready to Install page, select **Next**.

   An information box shows the installation progress of the selected components. This may take a few minutes.

1. When the installation has completed, select **Finish**.

Successful installation of Replication Server results in the creation of directory structures and files in your host environment as described in [Installation details](installation_details). Verify that the path to your Java runtime program set in `XDB_HOME\etc\edb-repl.conf` is correct.
