## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the EDB repository.

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

  To determine if your repository exists, enter this command:

  `apt-cache search enterprisedb`

  If no output is generated, the repository isn't installed.

  To set up the EDB repository:

  1. Go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).

  1. Select the button that provides access to the EDB repository.
  1. Select the platform and software that you want to download.

  1. Follow the instructions for setting up the EDB repository.

## Install the package

You can install all Replication Server components with a single install command, or you may choose to install selected, individual components by installing only those particular packages.

To install all Replication Server components:

```shell
sudo apt-get  -y install edb-xdb
```

To install an individual component:

```shell
sudo apt-get  -y install <package_name>
```

Where `<package_name>` is:

| Package name         | Component                                                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `edb-xdb-console`    | Replication console and the Replication Server command line interface |
| `edb-xdb-publisher`  | Publication server                                                    |
| `edb-xdb-subscriber` | Subscription server                                                   |

## Initial configuration

Before using Replication Server, you must download and install JDBC drivers. See [Installing a JDBC driver](/eprs/7/installing/installing_jdbc_driver) for details.
