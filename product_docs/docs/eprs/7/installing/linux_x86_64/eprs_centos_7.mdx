## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the EDB repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

  To determine if your repository exists, enter this command:

  `dnf repolist | grep enterprisedb`

  If no output is generated, the repository isn't installed.

  To set up the EDB repository:

  1. Go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).

  1. Select the button that provides access to the EDB repo.

  1. Select the platform and software that you want to download.

- Install the EPEL repository
  ```shell
  sudo yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
  ```

## Install the package

You can install all Replication Server components with a single install command, or you may choose to install selected, individual components by installing only those particular packages.

To install all Replication Server components:

```shell
sudo yum  -y install edb-xdb
```

To install an individual component:

```shell
sudo yum  -y install <package_name>
```

Where `<package_name>` is:

| Package name         | Component                                                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `edb-xdb-console`    | Replication console and the Replication Server command line interface |
| `edb-xdb-publisher`  | Publication server                                                    |
| `edb-xdb-subscriber` | Subscription server                                                   |

## Initial configuration

Before using Replication Server, you must download and install JDBC drivers. See [Installing a JDBC driver](/eprs/7/installing/installing_jdbc_driver) for details.
