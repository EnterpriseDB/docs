## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install Java (version 1.8 or later) on your server, if not present.

  ```shell
  sudo zypper -y install java
  ```

  !!!note
  When Replication Server is installed on a machine where Java is not present, the JDK is installed as part of the installation process. Since in this case the JDK was installed via Replication Server as its dependency, if you subsequently remove the JDK, Replication Server is also removed.

  If Java 1.8 or greater exists before installing Replication Server, the installed Replication Server is not removed on removal of the JDK.
  !!!

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Address other prerequisites

  ```shell
  # Activate the required SUSE module
  sudo SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/ppc64le
  sudo SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/ppc64le

  # Refresh the metadata
  sudo zypper refresh
  ```

## Install the package

You can install all Replication Server components with a single install command, or you may choose to install selected, individual components by installing only those particular packages.

To install all Replication Server components:

```shell
sudo zypper  -y install edb-xdb
```

To install an individual component:

```shell
sudo zypper  -y install <package_name>
```

Where `<package_name>` is:

| Package name         | Component                                                             |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `edb-xdb-console`    | Replication console and the Replication Server command line interface |
| `edb-xdb-publisher`  | Publication server                                                    |
| `edb-xdb-subscriber` | Subscription server                                                   |

## Initial configuration

Before using Replication Server, you must download and install JDBC drivers. See [Installing a JDBC driver](/eprs/7/installing/installing_jdbc_driver) for details.
