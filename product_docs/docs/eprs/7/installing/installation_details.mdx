## Windows details

On Windows systems, the publication server and subscription server run as services named `Publication Service` and `Subscription Service`.

## Linux details

On Linux hosts where you installed Replication Server with the graphical installer or from the command line, a publication server daemon and a subscription server daemon are now running on your computer, assuming you chose to install the publication server and subscription server components. If you installed the Replication Server RPM package, you must start the publication server and the subscription server based on the instructions in [Registering a publication server](../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) for the publication server and [Registering a subscription server](../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server) for the subscription server.

!!! Note
    On some Linux systems, you might have to restart the server before you can see the EPRS Replication Console choice in the application menu. If the Replication Console choice is still unavailable in the application menu, you can start it by invoking the script `XDB_HOME/bin/runRepConsole.sh`.

## Additional details

The Postgres application menu contains a new item for the EPRS Replication Console.

!!! Note
    If Replication Server is installed from a Replication Server RPM package, start the EPRS Replication Console by invoking the script `XDB_HOME/bin/runRepConsole.sh`.

During the configuration process, you might need the following files that are created during installation.

!!! Note
    - `XDB_HOME` is the directory where Replication Server is installed. 
    - For Linux, Replication Server is installed in the `/usr/edb/xdb` directory.
    - For Windows, Replication Server is installed in the `C:\Program Files\edb\EnterpriseDB-xDBReplicationServer` directory.

!!! Note
    `POSTGRES_HOME` is the home directory of the postgres operating system account (enterprisedb for EDB Postgres Advanced Server installed in Oracle-compatible configuration mode).

!!! Note
    The publication and subscription services startup log files (`edb-xdbpubserver.log` and `edb-xdbsubserver.log`) aren't generated for Windows and Mac OS X operating systems.

!!! Note
    `USER_HOME` is the home directory of the operating system account in use.

!!! Note
    The Replication Server version number is represented by `x.x` or by `xx` (for example `7.0` or `70`).
