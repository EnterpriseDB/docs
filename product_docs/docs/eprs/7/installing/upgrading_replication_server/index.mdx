You can install Replication Server 7 when you have existing single-master or multi-master replication systems that are running under Replication Server version 7.

It is assumed that you are installing Replication Server 7.x on the same host machine that is currently running the earlier version of Replication Server you are upgrading from and that you will then manage the existing replication systems using Replication Server 7.x.

If you are using a version of Replication Server earlier than 6.2.15, first upgrade to 6.2.15 or a later 6.2.x point version before upgrading to 7.x. 

!!!note
   Version 7.x provides a non-breaking upgrade path for existing 6.2.x based cluster deployments; however, we strongly recommended that you verify the upgrade in a staging or nonproduction environment before applying the upgrade in a production environment. There is no downgrade path from version 7.x to version 6.2.x so it is essential to test the upgrade first before applying it to the production environment.  



For more details on upgrading Replication Server, see:

- [Updating the publication and subscription server](updating_sub_and_pub_ports)
- [Upgrading from a Replication Server 6.2 installation on Linux](upgrading_with_xdb_rpm_package)
- [Upgrading from a Replication Server 7.x installation on Linux](upgrading_linux)
- [Upgrading with the graphical user interface installer](upgrading_with_gui_installer)

After upgrading and before using Replication Server, you need to download a JDBC driver and create a symlink to it (for Linux) or rename the driver (for Windows). See [Installing a JDBC driver](../installing_jdbc_driver/) for more information.
