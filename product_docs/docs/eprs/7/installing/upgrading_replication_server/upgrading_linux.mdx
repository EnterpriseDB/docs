If you have an existing Replication Server 7.x installation on Linux, you can use yum to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the `edb.repo` file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

`yum upgrade edb-repo`

`yum` updates the `edb.repo` file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your `edb.repo` file. Then, you can use yum to upgrade any installed packages:

`yum upgrade edb-xdb*`

If you're upgrading from a Replication Server 6.2 installation on Linux, see [Upgrading from a Replication Server 6.2 installation on Linux](upgrading_with_xdb_rpm_package) for details.

After upgrading and before using Replication Server, you need to download a JDBC driver and create a symlink to it. See [Installing a JDBC driver](../installing_jdbc_driver/) for more information.
