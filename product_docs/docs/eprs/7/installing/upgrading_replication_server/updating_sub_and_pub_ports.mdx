The newly installed publication server and subscription server of Replication Server 7 are configured to use the default port numbers 9051 and 9052, respectively. These port numbers are set in the Replication Server startup configuration file as described [Replication Server configuration file](../../02_overview/03_replication_server_components_and_architecture/01_physical_components/#xdb_replication_conf_file).

If your Replication Server 6.2.x replication systems were running under port numbers other than 9051 and 9052, you must adjust some of your settings in Replication Server 7 to continue to use these existing replication systems.

!!! Note
    The following changes regarding port 9052 and the subscription server are needed only if you're running a single-master replication system. If you're using only a multi-master replication system, then only the changes involving port 9051 and the publication server are needed.

You can use either of two methods can correct this:

-   To continue to use the old port numbers (other than 9051 and 9052) that were in use for Replication Server 6.2.x, stop the publication and subscription servers. Change the settings of the `PUBPORT` and `SUBPORT` parameters in the Replication Server Startup Configuration file from `9051` and `9052` to the old port numbers used by Replication Server 6.2.x. Restart the publication and subscription servers. Register the publication server and the subscription server with the old Replication Server 6.2.x port numbers along with the admin user and password as described in [Registering a publication server](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) and [Registering a subscription server](../../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server).
-   To use the default port numbers 9051 and 9052 with the Replication Server 7 replication systems, you must replace the old port numbers with the default port numbers 9051 and 9052. Register the publication server and the subscription server with port numbers 9051 and 9052 along with the admin user and password as described in [Registering a publication server](../../05_smr_operation/02_creating_publication/01_registering_publication_server/#registering_publication_server) and [Registering a subscription server](../../05_smr_operation/03_creating_subscription/01_registering_subscription_server/#registering_subscription_server). For single-master replication systems only, you then need to change the port numbers stored in the control schema from the old port numbers to 9051 and 9052. First, perform the procedure described in [Subscription server network location](../../07_common_operations/06_managing_publication/01_updating_publication_server/#sub_server_network_loc), and then perform the procedure described in [Updating a subscription](../../05_smr_operation/05_managing_subscription/#updating-a-subscription).

After making the changes, select **Refresh** in the Replication Server console. The replication tree of the Replication Server console displays the complete set of nodes for the replication systems.
