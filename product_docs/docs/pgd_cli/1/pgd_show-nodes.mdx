title: show-nodes
---

Shows all nodes in the BDR cluster and their summary.

### Synopsis

Shows all nodes in the BDR cluster and their summary such as name, node id,
group, and current/target state etc.

Node States

* NONE: Node state is unset when the worker starts, expected to be set
quickly to the current known state.
* CREATED: bdr.create_node() has been executed, but the node is not a
member of any BDR cluster yet.
* JOIN_START: bdr.join_node_group() begins to join the local node to an
existing BDR cluster.
* JOINING: The node join has started and is currently at the initial sync
phase, creating the schema and data on the node.
* CATCHUP: Initial sync phase is completed; now the join is at the last step
of retrieving and applying transactions that were performed on the upstream
peer node since the join started.
* STANDBY:  Node join has finished, but not yet started to broadcast changes.
All joins spend some time in this state, but if defined as a Logical
Standby, the node will continue in this state.
* PROMOTE: Node was a logical standby and we just called bdr.promote_node to
move the node state to ACTIVE. These two PROMOTE states have to be
coherent to the fact, that only one node can be with a state higher than
STANDBY but lower than ACTIVE.
* PROMOTING: Promotion from logical standby to full BDR node is in progress.
* ACTIVE: The node is a full BDR node and is currently ACTIVE. This is the
most common node status.
* PART_START: Node was ACTIVE or STANDBY and we just called bdr.part_node
to remove the node from the BDR cluster.
* PARTING: Node disconnects from other nodes and plays no further part in
consensus or replication.
* PART_CATCHUP: Non-parting nodes synchronize any missing data from the
recently parted node.
* PARTED: Node parting operation is now complete on all nodes.

Only one node at a time can be in either of the states PROMOTE or PROMOTING.

Note that the read-only state of a node, as shown in the Current State or in
the Target State columns, is indicated as STANDBY.

pgd show-nodes [flags]

### Examples

```text

  Example 1 (3 node cluster, bdr-a1 and bdr-c1 are up, bdr-b1 is down)

  $ pgd show-nodes

  Node   Node ID    Node Group Current State Target State Status      Seq ID
  ----   -------    ---------- ------------- ------------ ------      ------
  bdr-a1 3136956818 bdrgroup   ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up          1
  bdr-b1 2380210996 bdrgroup   ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Unreachable 2
  bdr-c1 1804769977 bdrgroup   ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up          3


  Example 2 (3 node cluster, all nodes are up)

  $ pgd show-nodes

  Node   Node ID    Node Group Current State Target State Status Seq ID
  ----   -------    ---------- ------------- ------------ ------ ------
  bdr-a1 3136956818 bdrgroup   ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     1
  bdr-b1 2380210996 bdrgroup   ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     2
  bdr-c1 1804769977 bdrgroup   ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     3


  Example 3 (cluster with witness, logical standby and subscriber-only nodes)
  Note: In contrast to logical standby, the subscriber-only nodes are fully
  joined node to the cluster

  $ pgd show-nodes

  Node               Node ID    Node Group      Current State Target State Status Seq ID
  ----               -------    ----------      ------------- ------------ ------ ------
  bdr-a1             3136956818 bdrgroup        ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     1
  bdr-b1             2380210996 bdrgroup        ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     2
  witness-c1         1450365472 bdrgroup        ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     3
  logical-standby-a1 1140256918 bdrgroup        STANDBY       STANDBY      Up     4
  logical-standby-b1 3541792022 bdrgroup        STANDBY       STANDBY      Up     5
  subscriber-only-c1 2448841809 subscriber-only ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     6

```
