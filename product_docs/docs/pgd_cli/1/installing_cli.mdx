## Installing with TPAexec

If you are using TPAexec to deploy EDB Postgres Distributed and the default deployment installs the PGD CLI package (`edb-pgd-cli`) on each BDR node automatically. It also creates the configuration file (`/etc/edb/pgd-config.yml`) prepopulated with the endpoints of each node in the cluster so no additional configuration is necessary.

If you wish to install the PGD CLI on any non-BDR instance in the cluster, you simply attach the pgdcli role to that instance in TPAexec's configuration file before deploying. See [TPAexec](/pgd/latest/deployments/tpaexec) for more information.



## Installing manually

You can manually install the PGD CLI on any Linux machine using `.deb` and `.rpm` packages available from the [BDR repository](https://techsupport.enterprisedb.com/software_subscriptions/add/products/bdr4/). The package name is `edb-pgd-cli`. For example:

```sh
# for Debian
sudo apt-get install edb-pgd-cli
```

When the PGD CLI is configured by TPAexec, it connects automatically, but with a manual installation you need to provide a connection string to the BDR cluster.


### Specifying database connection strings

You can either use a configuration file to specify the database connection strings for your cluster (see following section) or pass the connection string directly to a command (see the [sample use case](/pgd_cli/latest/using_cli/#passing-a-database-connection-string-directly-to-a-command)). 

#### Using a configuration file

Use the `pgd-config.yml` configuration file to specify the database connection string for your cluster. The configuration file should contain the database connection string for at least one BDR node in the cluster. The cluster name is optional and not validated.

For example:

```yaml
cluster:
  name: cluster-name
  endpoints:
  - "host=bdr-a1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres "
  - "host=bdr-b1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres "
  - "host=bdr-c1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres "
```

The `pgd-config.yml`, is located in the `/etc/edb` directory, by default. The PGD CLI searches for `pgd-config.yml` in the following locations (precedence order - higher to lower):

  1. `/etc/edb` (default)
  2. `$HOME/.edb`
  3. `.` (working directory)

If you rename the file or move it to another location, specify the new name and location using the optional `-f` or `--config-file` flag when entering a command. See the [sample use case](/pgd_cli/latest/using_cli/#passing-a-database-connection-string-directly-to-a-command).
