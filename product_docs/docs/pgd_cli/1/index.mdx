---

The EDB Postgres Distributed Command Line Interface (PGD CLI) is a tool to manage your BDR cluster. It allows you to run commands against BDR clusters. 

You can use it to inspect and manage cluster resources and to get information on the following:

-   node summary
-   BDR/Postgres version on each node
-   replication and subscription details
-   membership and worker events
-   raft consensus details
-   CAMO (Commit at Most Once) details
-   clock skew
-   cluster health summary

## Supported version

BDR 4.1 and later.

## Command line help

To list the supported commands, enter:

```sh
pgd help
```

For help for a specific command and its parameters, enter `pgd help <command_name>`. For example:

```sh
pgd help show-nodes
```

## Configuration

You can either use a configuration file to specify the database connection strings for your cluster or pass the connection string directly to a command.

### Using a configuration file

Use the `pgd-config.yml` configuration file to specify the database connection string for your cluster. The configuration file should contain the database connection string for at least one BDR node in the cluster. The cluster name is optional and not validated.

For example:

```yaml
cluster:
  name: cluster-name
  endpoints:
  - "host=bdr-a1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres "
  - "host=bdr-b1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres "
  - "host=bdr-c1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres "
```

The `pgd-config.yml`, is located in the `/etc/edb` directory, by default. The PGD CLI searches for `pgd-config.yml` in the following locations (precedence order - higher to lower):

  1. `/etc/edb` (default)
  2. `$HOME/.edb`
  3. `.` (working directory)

If you rename the file or move it to another location, specify the new name and location using the optional `-f` or `--config-file` flag. For example:

```sh
  pgd show-nodes -f /opt/my-config.yml
```

### Passing a database connection string directly to a command

Use the `--dsn` flag to pass a database connection string directly to a command. You don't need a configuration file if you pass the connection string with this flag. The flag takes precedence if a configuration file is present. For example:

```sh
pgd show-nodes --dsn "host=bdr-a1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres "
```

## Postgres user privileges

The PGD CLI requires postgres superuser privileges to run.

## Installation

### TPAexec

The easiest way to install and configure the PGD CLI is to use EDB's TPAexec utility for cluster deployment and management. For more information, see the [TPAexec](/pgd/4/deployments/tpaexec).

TPAexec installs the PGD CLI package (`edb-pgd-cli`) on each BDR node, by default. It also creates the configuration file (`/etc/edb/pgd-config.yml`) prepopulated with the endpoints of each node in the cluster.
If you wish to install it on any non-BDR instance in the cluster, attach the pgdcli role to that instance in TPAexec's configuration file.

### Manual

You can manually install the PGD CLI on any Linux machine using `.deb` and `.rpm` packages available from the [BDR repository](https://techsupport.enterprisedb.com/software_subscriptions/add/products/bdr4/). The package name is `edb-pgd-cli`. For example:

```sh
# for Debian
sudo apt-get install edb-pgd-cli
```

When the PGD CLI is configured by TPAexec, it connects automatically. With a manual installation you need to provide connection string to the BDR cluster.

## Output format

The PGD CLI supports the following output formats:

| Format  | Considerations |
| ------- | -------------- |
| tabular | Default format. Presents the data in tabular form.|
| json    | Presents the raw data with no formatting. For some commands, the json output may show more data than shown in the tabular output such as extra fields and more detailed messages. |
| yaml    | Same as json except field order is alphabetical. Experimental and may not be fully supported in future versions. |

Use the `-o` or `--output` flag to change the default output format to json or yaml. For example:

```sh
pgd show-nodes -o json
```
