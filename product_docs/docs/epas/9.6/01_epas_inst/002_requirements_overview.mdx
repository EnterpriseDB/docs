## RPM Installation Prerequisites

You can use an RPM package to install Advanced Server and supporting components on a Linux host. Before installing Advanced Server, you must:

**Install the EPEL Release Package**

You can use yum to install the epel-release package:

> yum -y install <https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm>

Please note that you may need to enable the \[extras] repository definition in the CentOS-Base.repo file (located in /etc/yum.repos.d).

If yum cannot access a repository that contains epel-release, you will get an error message:

No package epel available.

Error: Nothing to do

If you receive this error, you can download the EPEL rpm package, and install it manually. To manually install EPEL, download the rpm package, assume superuser privileges, navigate into the directory that contains the package, and install EPEL with the command:

yum install epel-release

You must also have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:
