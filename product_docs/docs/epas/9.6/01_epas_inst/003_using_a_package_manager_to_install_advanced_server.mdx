title: Using a Package Manager to Install Advanced Server
---


You can use the yum package manager to install Advanced Server or Advanced Server supporting components. yum will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but requires access to the Advanced Server repositories. If your system does not have access to a repository via the Internet, you can use RPM to install a package or create a local repository, but you may be required to manually satisfy package dependencies.

The Advanced Server meta installer RPM installs Advanced Server and its core components. You can use the meta installer for installation convenience, or pick and choose any sub-component that you need on a particular machine. Note that some sub-components require the installation of other Advanced Server component packages, while other packages may be installed individually. For a complete list of the RPM installers available for Advanced Server and its supporting components, see Section <span class="underline">3.1.</span>

Installing the server package creates a database superuser named enterprisedb. The user is assigned a user ID (UID) and a group ID (GID) of 26. The user has no default password; use the passwd command to assign a password for the user. The default shell for the user is bash, and the user's home directory is /var/lib/edb/as9.6.

By default, Advanced Server logging is configured to write files to the pg\_log subdirectory of the data directory, rotating the files each day and retaining one week of log entries. You can customize the logging behavior of the server by modifying the postgresql.conf file; for more information about modifying the postgresql.conf file, please see Section <span class="underline">6.1</span>.

The RPM installers place Advanced Server components in the directories listed in the table below:

| Component                         | Location                                    |

The file locations are Linux Standard Base (LSB) compliant.

## Installing an RPM Package

Before installing the Advanced Server or a supporting component via an RPM package, you must request access to the EnterpriseDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

> <https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf>

After receiving your repository credentials you can:

1.  Create the repository configuration file.

2.  Modify the file, providing your user name and password.

3.  Install Advanced Server and its supporting components.

**Creating a Repository Configuration File and Installing Advanced Server**

To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

> yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm

The repository configuration file is named edb.repo. The file resides in /etc/yum.repos.d.

After creating the edb.repo file, use your choice of editor to ensure that the value of the enabled parameter is 1, and replace the username and password placeholders in the baseurl specification with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

\[edb\]

name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch

baseurl=https://\<*username\>*:\<*password\>*@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch

enabled=1

gpgcheck=1

gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY

After saving your changes to the configuration file, you can use yum install command to install Advanced Server. For example, to install the server and its core components, use the command:

> yum install edb-as96-server

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter a y, and press Return to continue.

After installing Advanced Server, you must configure the installation; see [Section <span class="underline">3.5</span>](#_Configuring_a_Package), *Configuring an Advanced Server Installation*, for details.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

## Installing a Package on SLES 12

You can use the zypper package manager to install Advanced Server or Advanced Server supporting components on an SLES 12 host. zypper will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but some components require access to specific repositories that are not hosted at EnterpriseDB.

To add Advanced Server or supporting components, use the following commands to add EnterpriseDB repository configuration files to your SLES host:

zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas96-sles.repo
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas-sles-tools.repo
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas-sles-dependencies.repo

Each command creates a repository configuration file in the /etc/zypp/repos.d directory. The files are named:
 - edbas96suse.repo
 - edbasdependencies.repo
 - edbastools.repo

After creating the repository configuration files, use the zypper refresh command to refresh the metadata on your SLES host to include the EnterpriseDB repositories:

/etc/zypp/repos.d \# zypper refresh
Repository 'SLES12-12-0' is up to date.
Repository 'SLES12-Pool' is up to date.
Repository 'SLES12-Updates' is up to date.
Retrieving repository 'EDB Postgres Advanced Server 9.6 12 - x86\_64' metadata -----------------------\[\\\]

Authentication required for 'https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/9.6/suse/suse-12-x86\_64'
User Name:
Password:

Building repository 'EDB Postgres Advanced Server 9.6 12 - x86\_64' cache..........................\[done\]
All repositories have been refreshed.
...

When prompted for a User Name and Password, provide your connection credentials for the EnterpriseDB repository. If you need credentials, contact EnterpriseDB at:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/general-inquiry-form>

Before installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server or supporting components, you must also add SUSEConnect and the SUSE Package Hub extension to the SLES host, and register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories. Use the commands:

zypper install SUSEConnect
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12/x86\_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12/x86\_64

For detailed information about registering a SUSE host, visit:

<https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7016626>

The following sections provide information about the specific repositories that are not hosted by EnterpriseDB, but that provide software that satisfies dependencies for each listed component. Please note that after adding repository access, you should use the zypper refresh command to process the repository content:

zypper refresh

***Java Components:***

Please note that only OpenJDK (version 1.8) is supported on SLES hosts of Java components. Before using an RPM installer to add Advanced Server or a supporting component that requires Java, use zypper to add supporting repository locations to your system.

Use the commands:

zypper addrepo http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Java:/Factory/SLE\_12\_SP2/Java:Factory.repo

zypper refresh

Then you can use the zypper install command to install Advanced Server or supporting components. For example, to install the server and its core components, invoke the command:

zypper install edb-as96

***Slony:***

If you are using a package to add Slony to an SLES host, please note that you must add access to the Perl repository:

For SLES 12 SP2:

zypper addrepo http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:languages:perl/SLE\_12\_SP2/devel:languages:perl.repo

For SLES 12 SP3:

zypper addrepo http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/devel:languages:perl/SLE\_12\_SP3/devel:languages:perl.repo

Then:

zypper refresh

***PostGIS:***

When using an RPM package to add PostGIS to an SLES host, you must add the following repository:

zypper addrepo "http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/Kolab:/3.3/SLE\_12/server:Kolab:3.3.repo"

***PEM Agent or pgAgent:***

When adding the PEM agent or pgAgent packages to an SLES host, please note that you must add access to the wxWidgets repository:

For SLES 12 SP2:

SUSEConnect -p sle-module-legacy/12/x86\_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12/x86\_64
zypper addrepo
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/wxWidgets/SLE\_12\_SP2/X11:wxWidgets.repo

For SLES 12 SP3:

SUSEConnect -p sle-module-legacy/12/x86\_64
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12/x86\_64
zypper addrepo
http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/X11:/wxWidgets/SLE\_12\_SP3/X11:wxWidgets.repo

Then:

zypper refresh

***BART:***

When installing BART on an SLES host, please note that you must add the SUSE SDK as well as the Archiving repository:

SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12/x86\_64

zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Archiving/SLE\_12\_SP3/Archiving.repo

zypper refresh

***Updating Components on a SLES Host:***

To update components installed with zypper, use the zypper update command.

For more information about the packages available from EnterpriseDB, see Section 3.6.

## Updating an RPM Installation

If you have an existing Advanced Server RPM installation, you can use yum to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the edb.repo file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

> yum upgrade edb-repo

yum will update the edb.repo file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your edb.repo file. Then, you can use yum to upgrade all packages whose names include the expression edb:

> yum upgrade *edb\**

Please note that the yum upgrade command will only perform an update between minor releases; to update between major releases, you must use pg\_upgrade.

For more information about using yum commands and options, enter yum --help on your command line, or visit:

<https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html/Deployment_Guide/ch-yum.html>

<span id="_Configuring_a_Package" class="anchor"></span>

## Installing Advanced Server on an Isolated Network

You can create a local yum repository to act as a host for the Advanced Server RPM packages if the server on which you wish to install Advanced Server (or supporting components) cannot directly access the EnterpriseDB repository. Please note that this is a high-level listing of the steps requires; you will need to modify the process for your individual network.

To create and use a local repository, you must:

1.  Use yum to install the yum-utils and createrepo packages:

> yum install yum-utils
> yum install createrepo

2.  Create a directory in which to store the repository:

> mkdir /srv/repos

3.  Copy the RPM installation packages to your local network repository. You can download the individual RPM files from:

> [yum.enterprisedb.com](yum.enterprisedb.com)

4.  Sync the RPM packages and create the repository.

> reposync -r edbas96 -p /srv/repos
> createrepo /srv/repos

5.  Install your preferred webserver on the host that will act as your local repository, and ensure that the repository directory is accessible to the other servers on your network. For example, you might install lighttpd:

> yum install lighttpd

6.  If you are using lighttpd, you must provide a configuration file that identifies the location of the repository on your local network. For example, the configuration file might contain:

> $HTTP\["host"\] == "yum.domain.com"{
> server.document-root = "/srv/repos"
> server.errorlog="/var/log/lighttpd/yum\_error.log"
> accesslog.filename = "/var/log/lighttpd/yum\_access.log"}
>
> For detailed information about installing, configuring and using lighttpd, visit the official project site at:

<http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/1/wiki/Docs>

7.  On each isolated database server, configure yum to pull updates from the mirrored repository on your local network. For example, you might create a file called /etc/yum.repos.d/edb-repo with connection information that specifies:

> \[edbas96\]
> name=EnterpriseDB Advanced Server 9.6
> baseurl=http://yum.domain.com/edbas96
> enabled=1
> gpgcheck=0

After specifying the location and connection information for your local repository, you can use yum commands to install Advanced Server and its supporting components on the isolated servers. For example:

> yum install edb-as96-server

For more information about creating a local repository, visit:

<http://yum.baseurl.org/>

## Configuring a Package Installation

The packages that install the database server component also create a service configuration file (on version 6.x hosts) or unit file (on version 7.x hosts), and service startup scripts.

### Modifying the data Directory Location on CentOS or RedHat 6.x

On a CentOS or RedHat version 6.x host, the service configuration file is named edb-as-9.6.sysconfig and resides in /etc/sysconfig/edb/as9.6.

![](./images/image3.png)

*Figure 3.5 -The Advanced Server service configuration file.*

The file contains the following environment variables:
 - PGENGINE specifies the location of the engine and utility executable files.
 - PGPORT specifies the listener port for the database server.
 - PGDATA specifies the path to the data directory.
 - PGLOG specifies the location of the log file to which the server writes startup information.
 - Use INITDBOPTS to specify any initdb option or options that you wish to apply to the new cluster.

You can modify the edb-as-9.6.sysconfig file before invoking the startup script to change the listener port, data directory location, startup log location or installation mode. Note that if you plan to create more than one instance on the same system, you may wish to copy the edb-as-9.6.sysconfig file (and the associated edb-as-9.6 startup script) and modify the file contents for each additional instance that resides on the same host.

Please note that the options specified in the service configuration file are only enforced if initdb is invoked via the service command; if you manually invoke initdb (at the command line), you must specify the other options (such as the location of the data directory and installation mode) on the command line.

### Modifying the data Directory Location on CentOS or RedHat 7.x

On a CentOS or RedHat version 7.x host, the unit file is named edb-as-9.6.service and resides in /usr/lib/systemd/system. The unit file contains references to the location of the Advanced Server data directory. You should avoid making any modifications directly to the unit file because it may be overwritten during package upgrades.

By default, data files reside under /var/lib/edb/as9.6/data directory. To use a data directory that resides in a non-default location, create a copy of the unit file under the /etc directory:

> cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-9.6.service
> /etc/systemd/system/

After copying the unit file to the new location, modify the service file (/etc/systemd/system/edb-as-9.6.service) with your editor of choice, correcting any required paths.

Then, use the following command to reload systemd, updating the modified service scripts:

> systemctl daemon-reload

Then, start the Advanced Server service with the following command:

> systemctl start edb-as-9.6

### Specifying initdb Options in the Service Configuration File

By default, the INITDBOPTS variable is commented out in the service configuration file; unless modified, when you run the service startup script, the new cluster will be created in a mode compatible with Oracle databases. Clusters created in this mode will contain a database named edb, and have a database superuser named enterprisedb.

To create a new cluster in PostgreSQL mode, remove the pound sign (\#) in front of the INITDBOPTS variable, enabling the "--no-redwood-compat" option. Clusters created in PostgreSQL mode will contain a database named postgres, and have a database superuser named postgres.

You may also specify multiple initdb options. For example, the following statement:

INITDBOPTS="--no-redwood-compat -U alice --locale=en\_US.UTF-8"

Creates a database cluster (without compatibility features for Oracle) that contains a database named postgres that is owned by a user named alice; the cluster uses UTF-8 encoding.

For more information about creating a custom cluster with initdb, see Section <span class="underline">5.4</span>.

### Creating a Database Cluster and Starting the Service

After specifying any options in the service configuration file, you must create the database cluster and start the service; these steps are platform specific.

***On RHEL or CentOS 6.x***

To create a database cluster in the PGDATA directory that listens on the port specified by the PGPORT specified in the service configuration file described in Section <span class="underline">3.5</span>, assume root privileges, and invoke the service script:

> service edb-as-9.6 initdb

You can also assign a locale to the cluster when invoking initdb. By default, initdb will use the value specified by the $LANG operating system variable, but if you append a preferred locale when invoking the script, the cluster will use the alternate value. For example, to create a database cluster that uses simplified Chinese, invoke the command:

> service edb-as-9.6 initdb zh\_CH.UTF-8

After creating a database cluster, start the database server with the command:

> service edb-as-9.6 start

The command starts a postmaster listening on the port specified in the service configuration file; by default, an Advanced Server postmaster listens on port 5444.

For more information about using the service command, please see Section <span class="underline">5.2.</span>

***On RHEL or CentOS 7.x***

To invoke initdb on a RHEL or CentOS 7.x system, with the options specified in the service configuration file, assume the identity of the operating system superuser:

> su - root

Then, invoke initdb:

> /usr/edb/as9.6/bin/edb-as-96-setup initdb

After creating the cluster, use systemctl to start, stop, or restart the service:

> systemctl { start | stop | restart } edb-as-9.6

### Starting Multiple Postmasters with Different Clusters

It is possible to use multiple postmasters, each with its own database cluster. The following sections describe how to set up an additional Advanced Server instance with its database cluster.

***On RHEL or CentOS 6.x***

The edb-as96-server-core RPM contains an “initscript” that is used to start the Advanced Server instance. The current version of this script has the logic to be able to start multiple postmasters, with different data areas, listening on different ports, etc. To use this functionality requires root access.

As an example, a secondary Advanced Server instance referred to as secondary is created by the following steps.

1.  Create a hard link in /etc/rc.d/init.d (or equivalent location) to edb-as-9.6 named secondary-edb-as-9.6. Be sure to pick a name not already used in /etc/rc.d/init.d.

> ln edb-as-9.6 secondary-edb-as-9.6

2.  Create a file in /etc/sysconfig/edb/as9.6/ named secondary-edb-as-9.6. This file is a shell script in which you would typically define PGDATA and PGOPTS. Since $PGDATA/postgresql.conf will override many of these settings, except PGDATA, you might notice unexpected results on startup.

3.  Create the target PGDATA.

4.  Run initdb on the target PGDATA as shown in the documentation referenced below. Automatic initdb may or may not work, so a manual one is preferred. This must be done as user enterprisedb.

> For information about using initdb, see the PostgreSQL Core Documentation available at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/app-initdb.html>

5.  Edit the postgresql.conf file to change the port, address, TCP/IP settings, etc.

6.  Start the postmaster with the following command:

> service secondary-edb-as-9.6 start

***On RHEL or CentOS 7.x***

The edb-as96-server-core RPM contains a unit file that is used to start the Advanced Server instance. The current version of this script has the logic to be able to start multiple postmasters, with different data areas, listening on different ports, etc. To use this functionality requires root access.

As an example, a secondary Advanced Server instance referred to as secondary is created by the following steps:

1.  Copy the default unit file with the new name. As noted at the top of the unit file, all modifications must be under /etc. Be sure to pick a name not already used in /etc/systemd/system.

> cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-9.6.service /etc/systemd/system/secondary-edb-as-9.6.service

2.  Edit this file and change PGDATA to point to the new data directory that you will create the cluster against.

3.  Create the target PGDATA with user enterprisedb.

4.  Run initdb using the provided setup script:

/usr/edb/as9.6/bin/edb-as-96-setup initdb secondary-edb-as-9.6

5.  Edit the postgresql.conf file to change the port, address, TCP/IP settings, etc.

6.  Make sure that new cluster runs after a reboot:

> systemctl enable secondary-edb-as-9.6

7.  Start the second cluster with the following command:

> systemctl start secondary-edb-as-9.6

## Advanced Server RPM Installers

The tables that follow list the packages that are available from EnterpriseDB. Please note that you can also use the yum search command to access a list of the packages that are currently available from your configured repository. To use the yum search command, open a command line, assume root privileges, and enter:

yum search *package*

Where *package* is the search term that specifies the name (or partial name) of a package. The repository search will return a list of available packages that include the specified search term.

The following table lists the packages that are stored in the AS 96 repository and the corresponding software installed by those packages:
