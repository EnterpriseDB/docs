## Typographical Conventions Used in this Guide

Certain typographical conventions are used in this manual to clarify the meaning and usage of various commands, statements, programs, examples, etc. This section provides a summary of these conventions.

In the following descriptions, a *term* refers to any word or group of words that are language keywords, user-supplied values, literals, etc. A term’s exact meaning depends upon the context in which it is used.
 - *Italic font* introduces a new term, typically in the sentence that defines it for the first time.
 - Fixed-width (mono-spaced) font is used for terms that must be given literally such as SQL commands, specific table and column names used in the examples, programming language keywords, etc. For example, SELECT \* FROM emp;
 - *Italic fixed-width font* is used for terms for which the user must substitute values in actual usage. For example, DELETE FROM *table\_name*;
 - A vertical pipe | denotes a choice between the terms on either side of the pipe. A vertical pipe is used to separate two or more alternative terms within square brackets (optional choices) or braces (one mandatory choice).
 - Square brackets \[ \] denote that one or none of the enclosed terms may be substituted. For example, \[ a | b \] means choose one of “a” or “b” or neither of the two.
 - Braces {} denote that exactly one of the enclosed alternatives must be specified. For example, { a | b } means exactly one of “a” or “b” must be specified.
 - Ellipses ... denote that the preceding term may be repeated. For example, \[ a | b \] ... means that you may have the sequence, “b a a b a”.
