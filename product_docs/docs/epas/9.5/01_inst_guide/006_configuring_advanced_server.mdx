title: Configuring Advanced Server
---


If you have performed an installation with a package manager, you can use your choice of editor to access and modify the configuration files. By default, when installed with a package manager, the configuration files are located in:

> /var/lib/ppas/9.5/data

Unless otherwise noted, the commands and paths noted in the following section assume that you have performed an installation with the interactive installer.

You can easily update configuration parameters that Advanced Server uses to decide the behavior of its component software by modifying the following configuration files:
 - The postgresql.conf file determines the initial values of Advanced Server configuration parameters.
 - The pg\_hba.conf file controls network authentication and authorization.
 - The pg\_ident.conf file maps operating system identities (user names) to Advanced Server identities (roles) when using ident-based authentication.

On a Windows system, the configuration files can be accessed from the Apps menu. To update these configuration files in Linux, navigate through the Postgres Plus Advanced Server 9.5 menu to the Expert Configuration menu and choose the menu selection that specifies the configuration file that you would like to edit (see Figure 6.1).

*Figure 6.1 — Edit the configuration files through the Expert Configuration menu selection.*

If superuser or administrative privileges are required to edit the file, a dialog opens prompting you for your password.

## Modifying the postgresql.conf File

Configuration parameters in the postgresql.conf file specify server behavior with regards to auditing, authentication, encryption, and other behaviors. The postgresql.conf file resides in the data directory under your Advanced Server installation; you can use your editor of choice to open the postgresql.conf file directly, or navigate through the Postgres Plus Advanced Server menu to the Expert Configuration menu, and select the Edit postgresql.conf menu selection.

If prompted, enter your password to access the configuration file (shown in Figure 6.2).

!\[image\]\(./images/image79.png)

*Figure 6.2 — The postgresql.conf file.*

Parameters that are preceded by a pound sign (\#) are set to their default value (as shown in the parameter setting). To change a parameter value, remove the pound sign and enter a new value. After setting or changing a parameter, you must either *reload* or *restart* the server for the new parameter value to take effect.

Within the postgresql.conf file, some parameters contain comments that indicate change requires restart. To view a list of the parameters that require a server restart, execute the following query at the EDB-PSQL command line (see Figure 6.3):

> SELECT name FROM pg\_settings WHERE context = 'postmaster';

![cf2](./images/image80.png)

*Figure 6.3 — Configuration parameters that require a server restart.*

If you are changing a parameter that requires a server restart, see [Section 5.1](#starting-and-stopping-advanced-server-and-supporting-components), *Starting and Stopping Advanced Server* for information about restarting Advanced Server.

You can reload the system configuration parameter values by navigating through the Postgres Plus Advanced Server 9.5 menu to the Expert Configuration menu, and choosing the Reload Configuration menu selection. Reloading the configuration parameters does not require Advanced Server users to log out of their current Advanced Server sessions.

## Modifying the pg\_hba.conf File

Entries in the pg\_hba.conf file specify the authentication method or methods that the server will use when authenticating connecting clients. Before connecting to the server, you may be required to modify the authentication properties specified in the pg\_hba.conf file.

When you invoke the initdb utility to create a cluster, initdb creates a pg\_hba.conf file for that cluster that specifies the type of authentication required from connecting clients.

The default authentication configuration specified in the pg\_hba.conf file is:

\# TYPE DATABASE USER ADDRESS METHOD

\# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only

local all all peer

\# IPv4 local connections:

host all all 127.0.0.1/32 ident

\# IPv6 local connections:

host all all ::1/128 ident

The pg\_hba.conf file specifies that connections are allowed using peer and ident authentication:
 - peer authentication allows local connections from the client's operating system user name to the database.
 - ident authentication allows TCP/IP connections from the client's operating system user name (as listed in on an ident server).

To modify the pg\_hba.conf file, open the file with your choice of editor. After modifying the authentication settings in the pg\_hba.conf file, use the services utility (Windows), or use the following command to restart the server and apply the changes:

> service ppas-9.5 restart (Linux)

Appropriate authetication methods provide protection and security. Please consult the PostgreSQL documentation for details about authentication options:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/auth-methods.html>

For more information about modifying the pg\_hba.conf file, see the PostgreSQL core documentation at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html>

## Setting Advanced Server Environment Variables

The graphical installers provide a script that simplifies the task of setting environment variables, allowing a user to more easily invoke client applications at the command line. The script sets the environment variables for your current shell session; when your shell session ends, the environment variables are destroyed. You may wish to invoke pgplus\_env or pg\_env from your system-wide shell startup script, so that environment variables are automatically defined for each shell session.

The pgplus\_env script is created during the Advanced Server installation process and reflects the choices made during installation. To invoke the script, open a command line and enter:

On Linux:

> source /opt/PostgresPlus/9.5AS/pgplus\_env.sh

On Windows:

> C:\\Progra\~1\\PostgresPlus\\9.5AS\\pgplus\_env.bat

As the pgplus\_env.sh script executes (on Linux), it sets the following environment variables:

> export PATH=/opt/PostgresPlus/9.5AS/bin:$PATH
>
> export EDBHOME=/opt/PostgresPlus/9.5AS
>
> export PGDATA=/opt/PostgresPlus/9.5AS/data
>
> export PGDATABASE=edb
>
> export PGPORT=5444
>
> export PGLOCALEDIR=/opt/PostgresPlus/9.5AS/share/locale

As the pgplus\_env.bat script executes (on Windows), it sets the following environment variables:

> PATH="C:\\Program Files\\PostgresPlus\\9.5AS\\bin";%PATH%
>
> EDBHOME=C:\\Program Files\\PostgresPlus\\9.5AS
>
> PGDATA=C:\\Program Files\\PostgresPlus\\9.5AS\\data
>
> PGDATABASE=edb
>
> PGUSER=enterprisedb
>
> PGPORT=5444
>
> PGLOCALEDIR=C:\\Program Files\\PostgresPlus\\9.5AS\\share\\locale

If you have used an installer created by EnterpriseDB to install PostgreSQL, the pg\_env script performs the same function. To invoke the pg\_env script, open a command line, and enter:

On Linux:

> source /opt/PostgreSQL/9.5/pg\_env.sh

On Windows:

> C:\\Progra\~1\\PostgreSQL\\9.5\\pg\_env.bat

As the pg\_env.sh script executes (on Linux), it sets the following environment variables:

> PATH=/home/opt/PostgreSQL/9.5/bin:$PATH
>
> PGDATA=/home/opt/PostgreSQL/9.5/data
>
> PGDATABASE=postgres
>
> PGUSER=postgres
>
> PGPORT=5432
>
> PGLOCALEDIR=/home/opt/PostgreSQL/9.5/share/locale
>
> MANPATH=$MANPATH:/home/opt/PostgreSQL/9.5/share/man

As the pg\_env.bat script executes (on Windows), it sets the following environment variables:

> PATH="C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\9.5\\bin";%PATH%
>
> PGDATA=C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\9.5\\data
>
> PGDATABASE=postgres
>
> PGUSER=postgres
>
> PGPORT=5432
>
> PGLOCALEDIR=C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\9.5\\share\\locale

## Connecting to Advanced Server

psql is a command line client application that allows you to query the server, and review the query results. Please note that additional configuration steps are required before connecting to an Oracle or MySQL database.

**Connecting to the Database with the psql Client**

To open the psql client, the client must be in your search path. The executable resides in the bin directory, under your Advanced Server installation.

Use the following command and command options to start the psql client:

> psql -d edb -U enterprisedb

!\[image\]\(./images/image81.png)

*Figure 6.4 — Connecting to the server.*

Where:

> \-d specifies the database to which psql will connect.
>
> \-U specifies the identity of the database user that will be used for the session.

If you have performed an installation with the interactive installer, you can easily access the psql client through the Applications or Start menu. Navigate through the Postgres Plus Advanced Server 9.5 menu to the Run SQL Command Line menu, and select EDB-PSQL. When the Terminal window opens, provide connection information for your session.

For more information about using the command line client, please refer to the PostgreSQL core documentation at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.5/static/app-psql.html>

### Connecting to an Oracle or MySQL Database

***Oracle Client Connectivity***

Before connecting Advanced Server to an Oracle database, you must download and install the Oracle JDBC driver (ojdbc14.jar) from the Oracle website. You can find a link to the free JDBC driver at:
