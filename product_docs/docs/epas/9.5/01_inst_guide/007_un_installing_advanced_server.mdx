title: Un-Installing Advanced Server
---


You can use either the rpm or yum command to remove RPM packages. Note that removing a package does not damage the Advanced Server data directory.

The Advanced Server interactive installer creates uninstallers that you can use to remove Advanced Server or any of its individual components. If you uninstall an Advanced Server component, the remainder of the Advanced Server installation will remain intact.

Note that after uninstalling Advanced Server, the cluster data files remain intact and the service user persists. You may manually remove the cluster data and service user from the system.

## Uninstalling a Package with rpm

Include the -e option on the rpm command to remove installed packages; the command syntax is:

> rpm -e package\_name \[*package*\_*name*…\]

Where *package\_name* is the name of the package that you would like to remove. The package name is the name of the .rpm file used when installing the package, with the version number and file extension (.rpm) removed; for example, the command:

> rpm -e ppas95

Removes the package installed with the command:

> rpm -i ppas95-9.5.*x*.*x*.rhel6.rpm

To instruct rpm to remove multiple packages, provide a list of packages you wish to remove when invoking the command.

## Uninstalling a Package with yum

You can use the yum remove command to remove an RPM package. To remove a package, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter the command:

> yum remove *package\_name*

Where *package\_name* is the name of the package that you would like to remove. The package name is the name of the .rpm file used when installing the package, with the file extension (.rpm) removed; for example, the command:

> yum remove ppas95

Removes the package installed with the command:

> yum install ppas95-9.5.*x*.*x*.rhel6.rpm

Note: yum and RPM will not remove a package that is required by another package. If you attempt to remove a package that satisfies a package dependency, yum or RPM will provide a warning.
