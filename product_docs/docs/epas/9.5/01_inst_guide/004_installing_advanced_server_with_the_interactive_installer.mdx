title: Installing Advanced Server with the Interactive Installer
---


The Advanced Server installer is available from the EnterpriseDB website at:

<http://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads>

After navigating to the Software Downloads page, choose the Advanced Server installation that corresponds to your platform. After selecting a download, you will be invited to register as an Advanced Server user. Enter your current EnterpriseDB login information, or complete an online registration form to start the download.

When the download completes, extract the files using your system-specific file extractor.

You can use the extracted installer in different installation modes to perform an Advanced Server installation:
 - For information about using the extracted files to perform a graphical installation on Windows, See [Section 4.3.1](#_Using_the_Graphical_2).
 - For information about performing a graphical installation on Linux, see [Section 4.3.2](#_Using_the_Graphical_1).
 - For information about using the installer to perform a command line installation, see [Section 4.4.1](#_Performing_a_Text).
 - For information about performing an unattended installation, see [Section 4.4.2](#_Performing_an_Unattended).
 - For information about performing an installation with limited privileges, see [Section 4.4.3](#_Performing_an_Installation).
 - For information about the command line options you can use when invoking the installer, see [Section 4.4.4](#_Reference_–_Command).

During the installation process, the Advanced Server installer program copies a number of temporary files to the location specified by the TEMP or TMP environment variable (on Windows), or to the /tmp directory (on Linux). You can optionally specify an alternate location for the installer to place the temporary files by modifying or creating the TEMP environment variable.

If invoking the installer from the command line, you can set the value of the variable on the command line:

> On Windows, use the command:
>
> SET TEMP=*temp*\_*file*\_*location*
>
> On Linux, use the command:
>
> export TEMP=*temp*\_*file*\_*location*

Where *temp\_file\_location* specifies the alternate location for the temporary files.

Please Note: If you are invoking the installer to perform a system upgrade, the installer will preserve the configuration options specified during the previous installation.

## Graphical Installation Prerequisites

***User Privileges***

Before invoking the installer on a Linux system, you must have superuser privileges to perform an Advanced Server installation. To perform an Advanced Server installation on a Windows system, you must have administrator privileges. If you are installing Advanced Server into a Windows system that is configured with User Account Control (UAC) enabled, you can assume sufficient privileges to invoke the graphical installer by right clicking on the name of the installer and selecting Run as administrator from the context menu. When prompted, enter an administrator password to continue.

***SELinux Permissions***

Before invoking the installer on a system that is running SELinux, you must set SELinux to permissive mode.

The following example works on Redhat Enterprise Linux, Fedora Core or CentOS distributions. Use comparable commands that are compatible with your Linux distribution to set SELinux to permissive mode during installation and return it to enforcing mode when installation is complete.

Before installing Advanced Server, set SELinux to permissive mode with the command:

> \# setenforce Permissive

When the installation is complete, return SELinux to enforcing mode with the command:

> \# setenforce Enforcing

***Linux-specific Software Requirements***

You must install xterm, konsole, or gnome-terminal before executing any console-based program installed by the Advanced Server installer. Without a console program, you will not be able to access Advanced Server configuration files through menu selections.

Before invoking StackBuilder Plus on a Linux system, you must install the redhat-lsb package. To install the package, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

> \# yum install redhat-lsb

For more information about using StackBuilder Plus, see Section <span class="underline">4.5</span>.

***Windows-specific Software Requirements***

Be sure to apply Windows operating system updates before invoking the Advanced Server installer. If (during the installation process) the installer encounters errors, exit the installation, and ensure that your version of Windows is up-to-date before restarting the installer.

***Migration Toolkit or EDB\*Plus Installation Pre-requisites***

Before using the Advanced Server installer to install Migration Toolkit or EDB\*Plus, you must first install Java (version 1.7 or later). On a Linux system, you can use the yum package manager to install Java. Open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

> \# yum install java-1.7.0

Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation.

If you are using Windows, Java installers and instructions are available online at:

<http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp>

!\[image\]\(./images/image15.png)

*Figure 4.12 — The Dynatune Dynamic Tuning: Server Utilization window.*

The edb\_dynatune configuration parameter determines how Advanced Server allocates system resources. Use the radio buttons on the Server Utilization window to set the initial value of the edb\_dynatune configuration parameter:
 - Select Development to set the value of edb\_dynatune to 33.

> A low value dedicates the least amount of the host machine’s resources to the database server. This is a good choice for a development machine.
 - Select General Purpose to set the value of edb\_dynatune to 66.

> A mid-range value dedicates a moderate amount of system resources to the database server. This would be a good setting for an application server with a fixed number of applications running on the same host as Advanced Server.
 - Select Dedicated to set the value of edb\_dynatune to 100.

> A high value dedicates most of the system resources to the database server. This is a good choice for a host machine that is dedicated to running Advanced Server.

After the installation is complete, you can adjust the value of edb\_dynatune by editing the postgresql.conf file. After editing the postgresql.conf file, you must restart the server for the changes to take effect.

Select the appropriate setting for your system, and click Next to continue to the Dynatune Dynamic Tuning: Workload Profile window (shown in Figure 4.13).

!\[image\]\(./images/image16.png)

*Figure 4.13 — The Dynatune Dynamic Tuning: Workload Profile window.*

Use the radio buttons on the Workload Profile window to specify the initial value of the edb\_dynatune\_profile configuration parameter. The edb\_dynatune\_profile parameter controls performance-tuning aspects based on the type of work that the server performs.
 - Select Transaction Processing (OLTP systems) to specify an edb\_dynatune\_profile value of oltp.

> Recommended when Advanced Server is processing heavy online transaction processing workloads.
 - Select General Purpose (OLTP and reporting workloads) to specify an edb\_dynatune\_profile value of mixed.

> Recommended for servers that provide a mix of transaction processing and data reporting.
 - Select Reporting (Complex queries or OLAP workloads) to specify an edb\_dynatune\_profile value of reporting.

> Recommended for database servers used for heavy data reporting.

After the installation is complete, you can adjust the value of edb\_dynatune\_profile by editing the postgresql.conf file. After editing the postgresql.conf file, you must restart the server for the changes to take effect.

For more information about edb\_dynatune and other performance-related topics, see the *EDB Postgres (Postgres Plus) Enterprise Edition Guide* available from the EnterpriseDB website at:

*Figure 4.14 — The Advanced Configuration window.*

PgBouncer is a lightweight connection pooling utility for Advanced Server. Connection pooling can dramatically reduce processing time and resources for systems maintaining client connections to one or more databases. By default, Advanced Server expects PgBouncer to listen on port 6432.

Please note that the pgbouncer program stores a list of users and passwords in clear-text form in the following file:

> C:\\Program Files\\PostgresPlus\\pgbouncer\\etc\\userlist.txt

By default, the file is located in a directory that is accessible only to the cluster owner (by default, enterprisedb), but administrators should take note of the file and maintain permissions in a manner that secures the file from un-trusted users.

For more information about PgBouncer, visit the project site at:

<https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PgBouncer>

pgAgent is a job scheduling agent for Postgres, capable of running multi-step batch/shell and SQL tasks on complex schedules. pgAgent also provides background support for the DBMS\_JOB built-in package that is compatible with Oracle databases.

*Figure 4.43 — The installer prompts you for additional directory locations.*

The default data directory is /opt/PostgresPlus/9.5AS/data. You can specify an alternate location, or press Enter to accept the default and continue.

The default location of the Advanced Server Write-Ahead Log Directory is /opt/PostgresPlus/9.5AS/data/pg\_xlog. Press Enter to accept the default location and continue, or specify an alternate location.

Advanced Server uses write-ahead logs to help ensure transaction safety and speed transaction processing; when you make a change to a table, the change is stored in shared memory and a record of the change is written to the write-ahead log. When you COMMIT a transaction, Advance Server writes contents of the write-ahead log to disk.

!\[image\]\(./images/image47.png)

*Figure 4.44 — Specifying a Configuration Mode.*

The installer prompts you to select a Configuration Mode (see Figure 4.44). The configuration mode specifies the server dialect that Advanced Server will be compatible with; you can choose between Compatible with Oracle and Compatible with PostgreSQL installation modes.

> This is not a comprehensive list of the compatibility features for Oracle included when Advanced Server is installed in Compatible with Oracle mode; more information about Advanced Server is available in the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer’s Guide*, available at:

<http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/products/documentation/enterpriseedition>

> If you choose to install in Compatible with Oracle mode, the Advanced Server superuser name is enterprisedb.

***Compatible with PostgreSQL Mode***

> When installed in Compatible with PostgreSQL mode, Advanced Server exhibits complete compatibility with Postgres version 9.5. For more information about Postgres functionality, see the PostgreSQL core documentation, available at:

<http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/products/documentation/enterpriseedition>

> If you choose to install in Compatible with PostgreSQL mode, the Advanced Server superuser name is postgres.

Press Enter to accept the default configuration mode (Compatible with Oracle) and continue; enter 2 and press Enter to install in Compatible with PostgreSQL mode. The installer prompts you for a database superuser password (see Figure 4.45).

!\[image\]\(./images/image48.png)

*Figure 4.45 — Enter password information for the service account.*

Advanced Server uses the password specified on the Password window for the database superuser and pgAgent service. The specified password must conform to any security policies existing on the Advanced Server host.

After entering a password in the Password field, confirm the password and press Enter to continue. The installer asks for Additional Configuration information (see Figure 4.46).

!\[image\]\(./images/image49.png)

*Figure 4.46 — The installer prompts for Additional Configuration information.*
 - When prompted, enter the Port that the Advanced Server service will monitor for connections. By default, Advanced Server chooses the first available port after port number 5444.
 - Specify a Locale by entering a locale number from the list shown. Accept the Default locale value to instruct the installer to use the system locale as the server locale.
 - When prompted, enter Y (or press Enter to accept the default value) to install the sample tables and procedures for the database dialect specified by the compatibility mode (Oracle or PostgreSQL).

<!-- end list -->
 - When the Update Notification Service prompt appears, enter Y to indicate that Advanced Server should notify you of any available updates and security patches for your installation of Advanced Server.

Dynatune functionality allows Advanced Server to make optimal usage of the system resources available on the host machine. To facilitate performance tuning through Dynatune, the installer prompts you for Server Utilization and Workload Profile information (see Figure 4.47).

!\[image\]\(./images/image50.png)

*Figure 4.47 — Specify Dynatune configuration information.*

The edb\_dynatune configuration parameter determines how Advanced Server allocates system resources. Specify a usage type for the Advanced Server installation to establish the initial value of edb\_dynatune.
 - Specify Development to set the value of edb\_dynatune to 33.

> A low value dedicates the least amount of the host machine’s resources to the database server. This is a good choice for a development machine.
 - Specify General Purpose to set the value of edb\_dynatune to 66.

> A mid-range value dedicates a moderate amount of system resources to the database server. This would be a good setting for an application server with a fixed number of applications running on the same host as Advanced Server.
 - Specify Dedicated to set the value of edb\_dynatune to 100.

> A high value dedicates most of the system resources to the database server. This is a good choice for a host machine that is dedicated to running Advanced Server.

Enter a value of 1, 2 or 3, or simply accept the default value of 2 (to indicate that the server will be used for General Purpose processing) and press Enter to continue.

Next, the Advanced Server installer prompts for a description of the system Workload Profile.

The installer uses the Workload Profile to establish the initial value of the edb\_dynatune\_profile configuration parameter. The edb\_dynatune\_profile parameter controls performance-tuning aspects based on the type of work that the server performs.
 - Enter 1 to indicate Transaction Processing (OLTP systems) and set the value of edb\_dynatune\_profile to oltp.

> Recommended when Advanced Server is processing heavy online transaction processing workloads.
 - Enter 2 to indicate General Purpose (OLTP and reporting workloads) and set the value of edb\_dynatune\_profile to mixed.

> Recommended for servers that provide a mix of transaction processing and data reporting.
 - Enter 3 to indicate Reporting (Complex queries or OLAP workloads) and set the value of edb\_dynatune\_profile to reporting.

> Recommended for database servers used for heavy data reporting.

After choosing a Workload Profile, press Enter to continue.

After the installation is complete, you can adjust the values of edb\_dynatune and edb\_dynatune\_profile by editing the postgresql.conf file and restarting the server.

For more information about edb\_dynatune and other performance-related topics, see the *EDB Postgres (Postgres Plus) Migration Guide*, available at:

<http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/products/documentation/enterpriseedition>

When the installer continues, it requests configuration information for the PgBouncer and pgAgent services (see Figure 4.48).

!\[image\]\(./images/image51.png)

*Figure 4.48 — The installer requests configuration information about PgBouncer and pgAgent.*

PgBouncer is a lightweight connection pooling utility for Advanced Server. Connection pooling can dramatically reduce processing time and resources for systems maintaining client connections to one or more databases.

Please note that the pgBouncer program stores a list of users and passwords in clear-text form in the following file:

> /opt/PostgresPlus/pgbouncer/etc/userlist.txt.

By default, the file is located in a directory that is accessible only to the cluster owner (by default, enterprisedb), but administrators should take note of the file and maintain permissions in a manner that secures the file from untrusted users.

For more information about PgBouncer, visit the project site at:

<http://pgbouncer.projects.postgresql.org/doc/usage.html>

By default, Advanced Server expects PgBouncer to listen on port 6432; update the Listening Port field, or accept the default, and press Enter to continue.

pgAgent is a job scheduling agent for Postgres, capable of running multi-step batch/shell and SQL tasks on complex schedules. pgAgent also provides background support for the DBMS\_JOB built-in package compatible with Oracle databases.

If enabled, the Update Notification Service notifies you of any available updates and security patches for your installation of Advanced Server.

By default, the installer specifies that Advanced Server should start the services when the system boots; specify n to disable PgBouncer, pgAgent and the Update Notification Service, or accept the defaults, and press Enter to continue to the Pre Installation Summary (shown in Figure 4.49).

!\[image\]\(./images/image52.png)

*Figure 4.49 — The Pre Installation Summary.*

The Pre Installation Summary lists the options specified during the installation setup process; review the listing and press Enter to continue; press Enter again to start the installation process. The installer extracts the Advanced Server files and proceeds with the installation (shown in Figure 4.50).

!\[image\]\(./images/image53.png)

*Figure 4.50 — The Advanced Server installer performs the installation.*

The dialog lists each module as it is being installed, and informs you when the installation is complete (see Figure 4.51).

!\[image\]\(./images/image54.png)

*Figure 4.51 — The text mode installation is complete.*

<span id="_Performing_an_Unattended" class="anchor"></span>

### Performing an Unattended Installation

To specify that the installer should run without user interaction, include the --mode unattended command line option. In unattended mode, the installer uses one of the following sources for configuration parameters:
 - command line options (specified when invoking the installer)

<!-- end list -->
 - parameters specified in an option file
 - Advanced Server installation defaults

Unattended installations are supported on both Windows and Linux systems.

You can embed the non-interactive Advanced Server installer within another application installer; during the installation process, a progress bar displays for the user (shown in Figure 4.52).

![Screenshot-Setup-1](./images/image55.png)

> *Figure 4.52 — Using --mode unattended displays a progress bar to the user.*

You must have superuser privileges to install Advanced Server using the --mode unattended option on a Linux system. On a Windows system, administrative privileges are required. If you are using the --mode unattended option to install Advanced Server with another installer, the calling installer must be invoked with superuser or administrative privileges.

To start the installer in unattended mode, specify the -mode unattended option on the command line.

***On Linux***

To install in unattended mode on a Linux machine, navigate to the directory that contains the Advanced Server installer and enter:

./ppasmeta-9.5.*x*.*x*-linux.run --mode unattended --superpassword *database*\_*superuser*\_*password* --webusername *edb*\_*user\_name@email.com* --webpassword *edb\_user\_password*

The --superpassword option specifies a password for the database superuser. If you omit the option, the database superuser password defaults to enterprisedb. The default password can be easily guessed by a potential intruder; be sure to provide a stronger password with the --superpassword option.

You must include the --webusername and --webpassword options to specify the identity of a registered EnterpriseDB user. There is no charge to register for an EnterpriseDB user account; if you do not have an account, you can create one at:

<http://www.enterprisedb.com/user-login-registration>

You can control configuration parameters for Advanced Server by specifying options at the command line, or by including the parameters in a configuration file. Specify the parameters within the configuration file in option=value pairs (shown in Figure 4.53).

!\[image\]\(./images/image56.png)

*Figure 4.53 — A sample configuration parameter file.*

When you invoke the installer, include the --optionfile parameter, and the complete path to the configuration parameter file:

\# ./ppasmeta-9.5.*x*.*x*-linux.run ‑‑optionfile /$HOME/config\_param

For more information about the command line options supported during an unattended installation, see [Section 4.4.4](#_Reference_–_Command), *Reference - Command Line Options*.

***On Windows***

To start the installer in unattended mode on a Windows system, navigate to the directory that contains the executable file, and enter:

ppasmeta-windows.exe --mode unattended --superpassword *database*\_*superuser*\_*password* --servicepassword *system*\_*password* ‑‑webusername *edb*\_*user\_name@email.com* --webpassword *edb\_user\_password*

Include the --servicepassword option to specify an operating system password for the user installing Advanced Server. Omitting the option can lead to authentication problems on some Windows systems, and enforced password policies may not accept the default password (enterprisedb).

Use the --webusername and --webpassword options to specify the identity of a registered EnterpriseDB user; if you do not have an account, you can create one at:

<http://www.enterprisedb.com/user-login-registration>

<span id="_Performing_an_Installation" class="anchor"></span>

### Performing an Installation with Limited Privileges

To perform an abbreviated installation of Advanced Server without access to root or administrative privileges, invoke the installer from the command line and include the ‑‑extract-only option. Invoking the installer with the ‑‑extract-only option extracts the binary files in an unaltered form, allowing you to experiment with a minimal installation of Advanced Server.

If you invoke the installer with the --extract-only option, you must manually start and stop the server with pg\_ctl. For more information about starting the Advanced Server service, see Section <span class="underline">5.2.3</span>, *Using pg\_ctl to Control Advanced Server*.

If you include the --extract-only option when you invoke the installer, the installer steps through a shortened form of the installation wizard. During the brief installation process, the installer generates an installation script that can be later used to complete a more complete installation. To invoke the installation script, you must have superuser privileges on Linux or administrative privileges on Windows.

The installation script:
 - Initializes the database cluster if the cluster is empty.
 - Configures the server to start at boot-time.
 - Creates services for the supporting components (such as pgAgent and PgBouncer).
 - Establishes initial values for Dynatune (dynamic tuning) variables.

The scripted Advanced Server installation does not include menu shortcuts or access to StackBuilder Plus, and no modifications are made to registry files. The Advanced Server Update Monitor will not detect components installed by the scripted installation, and will not issue alerts for available updates to those components.

To perform a limited installation and generate an installation script, download and unpack the Advanced Server installer. Navigate into the directory that contains the installer, and invoke the installer with the command:

> On Linux:
>
> ./ppasmeta-9.5.*x.x*-linux.run --extract-only yes
>
> On Windows:
>
> ppasmeta-9.5.*x.x*-windows.exe --extract-only yes

A dialog opens, prompting you to choose an installation language. Select a language for the installation from the drop-down listbox, and click OK to continue. The Setup Wizard opens (shown in Figure 4.54).

!\[image\]\(./images/image22.png)

*Figure 4.54 — The Welcome window.*

Click Next to continue to the Advanced Server license agreement (shown in Figure 4.55).

!\[image\]\(./images/image23.png)

*Figure 4.55 — The Advanced Server license agreement.*

After reading the license agreement, select the appropriate radio button and click Next to continue to the User Authentication window (shown in Figure 4.56).

!\[image\]\(./images/image57.png)

*Figure 4.56 — The Advanced Server User Authentication window.*

Before continuing, you must provide the email address and password associated with your EnterpriseDB user account. Registration is free; if you do not have a user account, click the link provided to open a web browser, and register your user information.

Enter the email address of a registered account in the Email field, and the corresponding password in the Password field, and click Next to continue.

!\[image\]\(./images/image58.png)

*Figure 4.57 — The Extract Mode confirmation window.*

The Extract Mode window (shown in Figure 4.57) serves as a reminder that this is a limited installation, and as such, Update Monitor will not be able to notify you of available updates for the software included in this installation. Click Next to continue to the Installation Directory window (shown in Figure 4.58).

!\[image\]\(./images/image25.png)

*Figure 4.58 — Specify an installation directory.*

> On Linux, the default Advanced Server installation directory is:
>
> /opt/PostgresPlus
>
> On Windows, the default Advanced Server installation directory is:
>
> C:\\Program Files (x86)\\PostgresPlus\\9.5AS

You can accept the default installation location, and click Next to continue to the Ready to Install window (shown in Figure 4.59), or optionally click the File Browser button to choose an alternate installation directory.

!\[image\]\(./images/image36.png)

*Figure 4.59 — The installation wizard is ready to install Advanced Server.*

Click Next to proceed with the Advanced Server installation.

!\[image\]\(./images/image59.png)

*Figure 4.60 — Progress bars mark installation progress.*

During the installation, progress bars and popups mark the installation progress (Figure 4.60).

A minimal installation of Advanced Server is complete (see Figure 4.61).

!\[image\]\(./images/image60.png)

*Figure 4.61 — The Advanced Server installation is complete.*

After completing the minimal installation, you can perform a full installation by executing the installation script that is (by default) located in:

> On Linux:
>
> /opt/PostgresPlus/
>
> On Windows:
>
> C:\\Program Files (x86)\\PostgresPlus\\

To execute the installation script, open a command line and navigate to the directory that contains the script. Assume superuser or administrative privileges, and execute the command:

> On Linux:
>
> ./runAsRoot.sh
>
> On Windows:
>
> cscript runAsAdmin.vbs

The installation script executes at the command line, prompting you for installation configuration information. The default configuration value is displayed in square braces after each prompt; update the default value or press Enter to accept the default value and continue.

The following dialog is an example of a scripted installation on a Linux system. The actual installation dialog will vary by platform and reflect the options specified during the installation.

## Using StackBuilder Plus

The StackBuilder Plus utility provides a graphical interface that simplifies the process of downloading and installing modules that complement your Advanced Server installation. When you install a module with StackBuilder Plus, StackBuilder Plus automatically resolves any software dependencies.

Please note: If your installation resides on a Linux system, you must install the redhat-lsb package before invoking StackBuilder Plus. For more information, see Section <span class="underline">4.1</span>.

You can invoke StackBuilder Plus at any time after the installation has completed by selecting the StackBuilder Plus menu option from the Postgres Plus Add-ons menu (Linux) or from the Apps menu (Windows). Enter your system password (if prompted), and the StackBuilder Plus welcome window opens (shown in Figure 4.62).

!\[image\]\(./images/image61.png)

*Figure 4.62 — The StackBuilder Plus welcome window.*

Use the drop-down listbox on the welcome window to select your Advanced Server installation.

StackBuilder Plus requires Internet access; if your installation of Advanced Server resides behind a firewall (with restricted Internet access), StackBuilder Plus can download program installers through a proxy server. The module provider determines if the module can be accessed through an HTTP proxy or an FTP proxy; currently, all updates are transferred via an HTTP proxy and the FTP proxy information is not used.

If the selected Advanced Server installation has restricted Internet access, use the Proxy Servers button on the Welcome window to open the Proxy servers dialog (shown in Figure 4.63).

!\[image\]\(./images/image62.png)

*Figure 4.63 — The Proxy servers dialog.*

Enter the IP address and port number of the proxy server in the HTTP proxy or FTP proxy fields on the Proxy servers dialog. Currently, all StackBuilder Plus modules are distributed via HTTP proxy (FTP proxy information is ignored). Click OK to continue.

!\[image\]\(./images/image63.png)

*Figure 4.64 — The StackBuilder Plus module selection window.*

The tree control on the StackBuilder Plus module selection window (shown in Figure 4.64) displays a node for each module category.
 - If the module is installed, you will see the word (installed) to the right of the module name.
 - If a module name is in **bold** type, the installer has detected a mismatch between the available version and the installed version.
 - Boxes next to the modules that are already installed, but eligible for update are automatically checked.

To add new modules to the selected Advanced Server installation, check the box to the left of the module name and click Next. A window opens, requesting your EnterpriseDB registration information (as shown in Figure 4.65).

!\[image\]\(./images/image64.png)

*Figure 4.65 — The User Authentication window.*

Before downloading and installing modules and updates with StackBuilder Plus, you must enter the user information associated with your EnterpriseDB account. If you do not have an EnterpriseDB user account, click the link provided to open a web browser, and enter your user information.

Enter the email address of a registered account in the Email field, and the corresponding password in the Password field, and click Next to continue. The next dialog confirms the packages selected (Figure 4.66).

!\[image\]\(./images/image65.png)

*Figure 4.66 — A summary window displays a list of selected packages.*

By default, the selected package installers are downloaded to:

On Windows:

> %TEMP%

On Linux:

> /tmp

You can change the directory; use the button to the right of the Download directory field to open a file selector, and choose an alternate location to store the downloaded installers. Click Next to connect to the server and download the required installation files. (see Figure 4.67).

!\[image\]\(./images/image66.png)

*Figure 4.67 — StackBuilder Plus is downloading installation files for the specified packages.*

When the download is complete, a window opens to confirm that the installation files have been downloaded and are ready for installation (see Figure 4.68).

!\[image\]\(./images/image67.png)

*Figure 4.68 — Confirmation that the download process is complete.*

You can check the box next to Skip Installation, and select Next to exit StackBuilder Plus without installing the downloaded files, or leave the box unchecked and click Next to start the installation process.

Each downloaded installer has different requirements. As the installers execute, they may prompt you to confirm acceptance of license agreements, to enter passwords, and enter configuration information.

During the installation process, you may be prompted by one (or more) of the installers to restart your system. Select No or Restart Later until all installations are completed. When the last installation has completed, re-boot the system to apply all of the updates.

You may occasionally encounter packages that don’t install successfully. If a package fails to install, StackBuilder Plus will alert you to the installation error with a popup dialog, and write a message to the log file at:

> On Windows: %TEMP%
>
> On Linux: /root

!\[image\]\(./images/image68.png)

*Figure 4.69 — StackBuilder Plus confirms the completed installation.*

When the installation is complete, StackBuilder Plus will alert you to the success or failure of the installations of the requested packages (see Figure 4.69). If you were prompted by an installer to restart your computer, re-boot now.

The following table lists some of the modules supported by StackBuilder Plus. Please note that the list is subject to change and varies by platform.

## Using the Update Monitor

The Update Monitor utility polls the Enterprise DB website and alerts you to security updates and enhancements as they become available for Advanced Server 9.5. Update Monitor is automatically installed and invoked with Advanced Server.

When Update Monitor is actively monitoring, the Postgres elephant icon is displayed in the system tray (see Figure 4.71).

![Screen shot 2011-03-22 at 9](./images/image69.png)

*Figure 4.71 — The Update Monitor icon.*

If you have installed more than one version of Advanced Server, Update Monitor watches for updates and alerts for all installed versions. When Update Monitor finds an update or alert, it displays an alert symbol to let you know that an update or alert is available for one of the Advanced Server installations (see Figure 4.72).

![Screen shot 2011-03-22 at 9](./images/image70.png)

*Figure 4.72- The Update Monitor icon displays an alert.*

Right click on the symbol to open the context menu (shown in Figure 4.73).

![Screen shot 2011-03-22 at 9](./images/image71.png)

*Figure 4.73 — The Update Monitor context menu.*

If updates are available for your Advanced Server installation, the update count is displayed after the Install components menu item. Click Install components to start the installation process.

A system dialog opens, prompting you to enter your password (Figure 4.74).

![Screen shot 2012-08-10 at 4](./images/image72.png)

*Figure 4.74 — Enter a superuser password.*

Enter a superuser password, and click OK to continue. StackBuilder Plus opens (shown in Figure 4.75).

!\[image\]\(./images/image73.png)

*Figure 4.75 — The StackBuilder Plus welcome window.*

The StackBuilder Plus wizard walks you through installing the latest versions of the Advanced Server component software; see [Section 4.5](#_Using_StackBuilder_Plus_10), *Using StackBuilder Plus* for more information about the update process.

When the update is complete and there are no new updates available, the Update Monitor icon returns to a non-alerted state.

Update Monitor also monitors the EnterpriseDB website for alerts. If an alert is available for your Advanced Server installation, the Update Monitor icon displays an alert symbol. Right-click on the icon to access the context menu, where the alert count is displayed after the View alerts menu item. Choose the View alerts option to display the Postgres Plus Alerts window (see Figure 4.76).

![UM2](./images/image74.png)

*Figure 4.76 — An EnterpriseDB alert.*
 - The Postgres Plus Alerts window displays helpful hyperlinks that can direct you to more information relevant to the alert.
 - Use the Run StackBuilder Plus button to open StackBuilder Plus from the alert to run applicable updates to your current Advanced Server installation.

## Installation Troubleshooting

***Difficulty Displaying Java-based Applications***

If you encounter difficulty displaying Java-based applications (controls or text not being displayed correctly, or blank windows), upgrading to the latest libxcb-xlib libraries should correct the problem on most Linux distributions.

Please visit the following link for other possible work-arounds:

<http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6532373>

***--mode unattended Authentication Errors***

Authentication errors from component modules during unattended installations may indicate that the specified values of --servicepassword or --superpassword may be incorrect.

***Errors During an Advanced Server Installation on Windows***

If you encounter an error during the installation process on a Windows system, exit the installation, and ensure that your version of Windows is up-to-date. After applying any outstanding operating system updates, re-invoke the Advanced Server installer.

***Applications Fail to Launch During an Advanced Server Installation on Linux***

If applications fail to launch (such as StackBuilder Plus or your web browser) during the installation process on a Linux system, verify that the xdg-open program is on your system. If xdg-open is missing, install the xdg-utils package.

If you are using the GNOME desktop, load the root profile before running the Advanced Server installation script. To load the root profile, issue the command, su - root instead of su root before installing Advanced Server.

***Configuration File Editors Close Spontaneously***

If you are using a Linux system with the gnome console, a bug in the gnome shell may cause configuration file editors accessed via the Expert Configuration menu (under the Postgres Plus Advanced Server Application menu) to close spontaneously. To correct this error, open a terminal window and enter:

dconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/cursor/active false

Please note that each time you reboot your system, you must invoke the command, resetting the value.

***The Installation Fails to Complete Due to Existing data Directory Contents***

If an installation fails to complete due to existing content in the data directory, the server will write an error message to the server logs:

A data directory is neither empty, or a recognisable data directory.

If you encounter a similar message, you should confirm that the data directory is empty; the presence of files (including the system-generated lost+found folder) will prevent the installation from completing. Either remove the files from the data directory, or specify a different location for the data directory before re-invoking the installer to complete the installation.
