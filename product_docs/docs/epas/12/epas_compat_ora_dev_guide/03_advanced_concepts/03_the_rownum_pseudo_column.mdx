`ROWNUM` is a pseudo-column that is assigned an incremental, unique integer value for each row based on the order the rows were retrieved from a query. Therefore, the first row retrieved will have `ROWNUM` of `1`; the second row will have `ROWNUM` of `2` and so on.

This feature can be used to limit the number of rows retrieved by a query. This is demonstrated in the following example:

```text
SELECT empno, ename, job FROM emp WHERE ROWNUM < 5;

 empno | ename |   job
-------+-------+----------
 7369  | SMITH | CLERK
 7499  | ALLEN | SALESMAN
 7521  | WARD  | SALESMAN
 7566  | JONES | MANAGER
(4 rows)
```

The `ROWNUM` value is assigned to each row before any sorting of the result set takes place. Thus, the result set is returned in the order given by the `ORDER BY` clause, but the `ROWNUM` values may not necessarily be in ascending order as shown in the following example:

```text
SELECT ROWNUM, empno, ename, job FROM emp WHERE ROWNUM < 5 ORDER BY ename;

 rownum | empno | ename |   job
--------+-------+-------+----------
      2 |  7499 | ALLEN | SALESMAN
      4 |  7566 | JONES | MANAGER
      1 |  7369 | SMITH | CLERK
      3 |  7521 | WARD  | SALESMAN
(4 rows)
```

The following example shows how a sequence number can be added to every row in the `jobhist` table. First a new column named, `seqno`, is added to the table and then `seqno` is set to `ROWNUM` in the `UPDATE` command.

```text
ALTER TABLE jobhist ADD seqno NUMBER(3);
UPDATE jobhist SET seqno = ROWNUM;
```

The following `SELECT` command shows the new `seqno` values.

```text
SELECT seqno, empno, TO_CHAR(startdate,'DD-MON-YY') AS start, job FROM
jobhist;

seqno  | empno |   start   |    job
