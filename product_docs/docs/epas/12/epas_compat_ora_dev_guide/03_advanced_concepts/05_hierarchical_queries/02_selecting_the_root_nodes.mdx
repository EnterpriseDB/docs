The `START WITH` clause is used to determine the row(s) selected by `table_expression` that are to be used as the root nodes. All rows selected by `table_expression` where `start_expression` evaluates to true become a root node of a tree. Thus, the number of potential trees in the result set is equal to the number of root nodes. As a consequence, if the `START WITH` clause is omitted, then every row returned by `table_expression` is a root of its own tree.
