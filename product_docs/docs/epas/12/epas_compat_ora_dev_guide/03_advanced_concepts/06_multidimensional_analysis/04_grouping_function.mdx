<div id="grouping_function" class="registered_link"></div>

When using the `ROLLUP, CUBE, or GROUPING SETS` extensions to the `GROUP BY` clause, it may sometimes be difficult to differentiate between the various levels of subtotals generated by the extensions as well as the base aggregate rows in the result set. The `GROUPING` function provides a means of making this distinction.

The general syntax for use of the `GROUPING` function is shown by the following.

```text
SELECT [ <expr> ...,] GROUPING( <col_expr> ) [, <expr> ] ...
FROM ...
GROUP BY [...,]
  { ROLLUP | CUBE | GROUPING SETS }( [...,] <col_expr>
  [, ...] ) [, ...]
```

The `GROUPING` function takes a single parameter that must be an expression of a dimension column specified in the expression list of a `ROLLUP, CUBE`, or `GROUPING SETS` extension of the `GROUP BY` clause.

The return value of the `GROUPING` function is either a 0 or 1. In the result set of a query, if the column expression specified in the `GROUPING` function is null because the row represents a subtotal over multiple values of that column then the `GROUPING` function returns a value of 1. If the row returns results based on a particular value of the column specified in the `GROUPING` function, then the `GROUPING` function returns a value of 0. In the latter case, the column can be null as well as non-null, but in any case, it is for a particular value of that column, not a subtotal across multiple values.

The following query shows how the return values of the `GROUPING` function correspond to the subtotal lines.

```text
SELECT loc, dname, job, COUNT(*) AS "employees",
  GROUPING(loc) AS "gf_loc",
  GROUPING(dname) AS "gf_dname",
  GROUPING(job) AS "gf_job"
FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY ROLLUP (loc, dname, job)
ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;
```

In the three right-most columns displaying the output of the `GROUPING` functions, a value of 1 appears on a subtotal line wherever a subtotal is taken across values of the corresponding columns.

```text
loc      |   dname    |    job    | employees | gf_loc | gf_dname | gf_job

BOSTON   | OPERATIONS |           |         3 |      0 |        0 |      1

BOSTON   | RESEARCH   |           |         5 |      0 |        0 |      1
BOSTON   |            |           |         8 |      0 |        1 |      1

NEW YORK | ACCOUNTING | MANAGER   |         1 |      0 |        0 |      0
NEW YORK | ACCOUNTING | PRESIDENT |         1 |      0 |        0 |      0
NEW YORK | ACCOUNTING |           |         3 |      0 |        0 |      1
NEW YORK |            |           |         3 |      0 |        1 |      1
         |            |           |        17 |      1 |        1 |      1
(20 rows)
```

These indicators can be used as screening criteria for particular subtotals. For example, using the previous query, you can display only those subtotals for `loc` and `dname` combinations by using the `GROUPING` function in a `HAVING` clause.

```text
SELECT loc, dname, job, COUNT(*) AS "employees",
  GROUPING(loc) AS "gf_loc",
  GROUPING(dname) AS "gf_dname",
  GROUPING(job) AS "gf_job"
FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY ROLLUP (loc, dname, job)
HAVING GROUPING(loc) = 0
  AND  GROUPING(dname) = 0
  AND  GROUPING(job) = 1
ORDER BY 1, 2;
```

This query produces the following result:

```text
loc      |   dname    | job | employees | gf_loc | gf_dname | gf_job
---------+------------+-----+-----------+--------+----------+--------
BOSTON   | OPERATIONS |     |         3 |      0 |        0 |      1
BOSTON   | RESEARCH   |     |         5 |      0 |        0 |      1
CHICAGO  | SALES      |     |         6 |      0 |        0 |      1
NEW YORK | ACCOUNTING |     |         3 |      0 |        0 |      1
(4 rows)
```

The `GROUPING` function can be used to distinguish a subtotal row from a base aggregate row or from certain subtotal rows where one of the items in the expression list returns null as a result of the column on which the expression is based being null for one or more rows in the table, as opposed to representing a subtotal over the column.

To illustrate this point, the following row is added to the `emp` table. This provides a row with a null value for the `job` column.

```text
INSERT INTO emp (empno,ename,deptno) VALUES (9004,'PETERS',40);
```

The following query is issued using a reduced number of rows for clarity.

```text
SELECT loc, job, COUNT(*) AS "employees",
  GROUPING(loc) AS "gf_loc",
  GROUPING(job) AS "gf_job"
FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno AND loc = 'BOSTON'
GROUP BY CUBE (loc, job)
ORDER BY 1, 2;
```

Note that the output contains two rows containing `BOSTON` in the `loc` column and spaces in the `job` column (fourth and fifth entries in the table).

```text
loc    |   job   | employees | gf_loc | gf_job
-------+---------+-----------+--------+--------
BOSTON | ANALYST |         3 |      0 |      0
BOSTON | CLERK   |         3 |      0 |      0
BOSTON | MANAGER |         2 |      0 |      0
BOSTON |         |         1 |      0 |      0
BOSTON |         |         9 |      0 |      1
       | ANALYST |         3 |      1 |      0
       | CLERK   |         3 |      1 |      0
       | MANAGER |         2 |      1 |      0
       |         |         1 |      1 |      0
       |         |         9 |      1 |      1
(10 rows)
```

The fifth row where the `GROUPING` function on the `job` column `(gf_job)` returns 1 indicates this is a subtotal over all jobs. Note that the row contains a subtotal value of 9 in the `employees` column.

The fourth row where the `GROUPING` function on the `job` column as well as on the `loc` column returns 0 indicates this is a base aggregate of all rows where `loc` is `BOSTON` and `job` is null, which is the row inserted for this example. The `employees` column contains 1, which is the count of the single such row inserted.

Also note that in the ninth row (next to last) the `GROUPING` function on the `job` column returns 0 while the `GROUPING` function on the `loc` column returns 1 indicating this is a subtotal over all locations where the `job` column is null, which again, is a count of the single row inserted for this example.
