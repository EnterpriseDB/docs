Suppose you want to make sure all employees belong to a valid department. This is called maintaining the *referential integrity* of your data. In simplistic database systems this would be implemented (if at all) by first looking at the `dept` table to check if a matching record exists, and then inserting or rejecting the new employee record. This approach has a number of problems and is very inconvenient. Advanced Server can make it easier for you.

A modified version of the `emp` table presented in [Creating a New Table](../02_sql_tutorial/02_creating_a_new_table/#creating_a_new_table) is shown in this section with the addition of a foreign key constraint. The modified `emp` table looks like the following:

```text
CREATE TABLE emp (
    empno           NUMBER(4) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT emp_pk PRIMARY KEY,
    ename           VARCHAR2(10),
    job             VARCHAR2(9),
    mgr             NUMBER(4),
    hiredate        DATE,
    sal             NUMBER(7,2),
    comm            NUMBER(7,2),
    deptno          NUMBER(2) CONSTRAINT emp_ref_dept_fk
                        REFERENCES dept(deptno)
);
```

If an attempt is made to issue the following `INSERT` command in the sample `emp` table, the foreign key constraint, `emp_ref_dept_fk`, ensures that department `50` exists in the `dept` table. Since it does not, the command is rejected.

```text
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (8000,'JONES','CLERK',7902,'17-AUG-07',1200,NULL,50);

ERROR:  insert or update on table "emp" violates foreign key constraint
"emp_ref_dept_fk"
DETAIL:  Key (deptno)=(50) is not present in table "dept".
```

The behavior of foreign keys can be finely tuned to your application. Making correct use of foreign keys will definitely improve the quality of your database applications, so you are strongly encouraged to learn more about them.
