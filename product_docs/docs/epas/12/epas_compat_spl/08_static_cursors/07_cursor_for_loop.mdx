<div id="cursor_for_loop" class="registered_link"></div>

In the cursor examples presented so far, the programming logic required to process the result set of a cursor included a statement to open the cursor, a loop construct to retrieve each row of the result set, a test for the end of the result set, and finally a statement to close the cursor. The *cursor FOR loop* is a loop construct that eliminates the need to individually code the statements just listed.

The cursor `FOR` loop opens a previously declared cursor, fetches all rows in the cursor result set, and then closes the cursor.

The syntax for creating a cursor `FOR` loop is as follows.

```text
FOR <record> IN <cursor>
LOOP
   <statements>
END LOOP;
```

`record` is an identifier assigned to an implicitly declared record with definition, `cursor%ROWTYPE. cursor` is the name of a previously declared cursor. `statements` are one or more SPL statements. There must be at least one statement.

The following example shows the example from [%NOTFOUND](06_cursor_attributes/03_notfound/#%25notfound), modified to use a cursor `FOR` loop.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    CURSOR emp_cur_1 IS SELECT * FROM emp;
BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('EMPNO    ENAME');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('-----    -------');
    FOR v_emp_rec IN emp_cur_1 LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_emp_rec.empno || '     ' || v_emp_rec.ename);
    END LOOP;
END;
```

The same results are achieved as shown in the output below.

```text
EXEC cursor_example;

EMPNO    ENAME

7499     ALLEN
