The following example is an after row-level trigger. When a new employee row is inserted, the trigger adds a new row to the `jobhist` table for that employee. When an existing employee is updated, the trigger sets the `enddate` column of the latest `jobhist` row (assumed to be the one with a null `enddate`) to the current date and inserts a new `jobhist` row with the employee’s new information.

Finally, trigger adds a row to the `empchglog` table with a description of the action.

```text
CREATE TABLE empchglog (
    chg_date        DATE,
    chg_desc        VARCHAR2(30)
);
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER emp_chg_trig
    AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON emp
    FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
    v_empno         emp.empno%TYPE;
    v_deptno        emp.deptno%TYPE;
    v_dname         dept.dname%TYPE;
    v_action        VARCHAR2(7);
    v_chgdesc       jobhist.chgdesc%TYPE;
BEGIN
    IF INSERTING THEN
        v_action := 'Added';
        v_empno := :NEW.empno;
        v_deptno := :NEW.deptno;
        INSERT INTO jobhist VALUES (:NEW.empno, SYSDATE, NULL,
            :NEW.job, :NEW.sal, :NEW.comm, :NEW.deptno, 'New Hire');
    ELSIF UPDATING THEN
        v_action := 'Updated';
        v_empno := :NEW.empno;
        v_deptno := :NEW.deptno;
        v_chgdesc := '';
        IF NVL(:OLD.ename, '-null-') != NVL(:NEW.ename, '-null-') THEN
            v_chgdesc := v_chgdesc || 'name, ';
        END IF;
        IF NVL(:OLD.job, '-null-') != NVL(:NEW.job, '-null-') THEN
            v_chgdesc := v_chgdesc || 'job, ';
        END IF;
        IF NVL(:OLD.sal, -1) != NVL(:NEW.sal, -1) THEN
            v_chgdesc := v_chgdesc || 'salary, ';
        END IF;
        IF NVL(:OLD.comm, -1) != NVL(:NEW.comm, -1) THEN
            v_chgdesc := v_chgdesc || 'commission, ';
        END IF;
        IF NVL(:OLD.deptno, -1) != NVL(:NEW.deptno, -1) THEN
            v_chgdesc := v_chgdesc || 'department, ';
        END IF;
        v_chgdesc := 'Changed ' || RTRIM(v_chgdesc, ', ');
        UPDATE jobhist SET enddate = SYSDATE WHERE empno = :OLD.empno
            AND enddate IS NULL;
        INSERT INTO jobhist VALUES (:NEW.empno, SYSDATE, NULL,
            :NEW.job, :NEW.sal, :NEW.comm, :NEW.deptno, v_chgdesc);
    ELSIF DELETING THEN
        v_action := 'Deleted';
        v_empno := :OLD.empno;
        v_deptno := :OLD.deptno;
    END IF;

    INSERT INTO empchglog VALUES (SYSDATE,
        v_action || ' employee # ' || v_empno);
END;
```

In the first sequence of commands shown below, two employees are added using two separate `INSERT` commands and then both are updated using a single `UPDATE` command. The contents of the `jobhist` table shows the action of the trigger for each affected row - two new hire entries for the two new employees and two changed commission records for the updated commissions on the two employees. The `empchglog` table also shows the trigger was fired a total of four times, once for each action on the two rows.

```text
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (9003,'PETERS','ANALYST',7782,SYSDATE,5000.00,NULL,40);

INSERT INTO emp VALUES (9004,'AIKENS','ANALYST',7782,SYSDATE,4500.00,NULL,40);

UPDATE emp SET comm = sal * 1.1 WHERE empno IN (9003, 9004);

SELECT * FROM jobhist WHERE empno IN (9003, 9004);

   EMPNO STARTDATE ENDDATE   JOB              SAL       COMM     DEPTNO   CHGDESC
---------- --------- --------- --------- ---------- ---------- ---------- -------------
    9003 31-MAR-05 31-MAR-05 ANALYST         5000                    40   New Hire
    9004 31-MAR-05 31-MAR-05 ANALYST         4500                    40   New Hire
    9003 31-MAR-05           ANALYST         5000       5500         40   Changed commission
    9004 31-MAR-05           ANALYST         4500       4950         40   Changed commission

SELECT * FROM empchglog;

CHG_DATE  CHG_DESC
--------- ------------------------------
31-MAR-05 Added employee # 9003
31-MAR-05 Added employee # 9004
31-MAR-05 Updated employee # 9003
31-MAR-05 Updated employee # 9004
```

Finally, both employees are deleted with a single `DELETE` command. The `empchglog` table now shows the trigger was fired twice, once for each deleted employee.

```text
DELETE FROM emp WHERE empno IN (9003, 9004);

SELECT * FROM empchglog;

CHG_DATE  CHG_DESC
--------- ------------------------------
31-MAR-05 Added employee # 9003
31-MAR-05 Added employee # 9004
31-MAR-05 Updated employee # 9003
31-MAR-05 Updated employee # 9004
31-MAR-05 Deleted employee # 9003
31-MAR-05 Deleted employee # 9004
```
