title: "Before Statement-Level Trigger"

---

<div id="before_statement_level_trigger" class="registered_link"></div>

The following is an example of a simple before statement-level trigger that displays a message prior to an insert operation on the `emp` table.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER emp_alert_trig
    BEFORE INSERT ON emp
BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('New employees are about to be added');
END;
```

The following `INSERT` is constructed so that several new rows are inserted upon a single execution of the command. For each row that has an employee id between 7900 and 7999, a new row is inserted with an employee id incremented by 1000. The following are the results of executing the command when three new rows are inserted.

```text
INSERT INTO emp (empno, ename, deptno) SELECT empno + 1000, ename, 40
    FROM emp WHERE empno BETWEEN 7900 AND 7999;
New employees are about to be added

SELECT empno, ename, deptno FROM emp WHERE empno BETWEEN 8900 AND 8999;

     EMPNO ENAME          DEPTNO
---------- ---------- ----------
      8900 JAMES              40
      8902 FORD               40
      8934 MILLER             40
```

The message, `New employees are about to be added`, is displayed once by the firing of the trigger even though the result is the addition of three new rows.
