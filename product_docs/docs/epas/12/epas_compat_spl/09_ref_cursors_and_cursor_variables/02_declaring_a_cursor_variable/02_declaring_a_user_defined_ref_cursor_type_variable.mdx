title: "Declaring a User Defined REF CURSOR Type Variable"

---

<div id="declaring_a_user_defined_ref_cursor_type_variable" class="registered_link"></div>

You must perform two distinct declaration steps in order to use a user defined `REF CURSOR` variable:

-   Create a referenced cursor `TYPE`
-   Declare the actual cursor variable based on that `TYPE`

The syntax for creating a user defined `REF CURSOR` type is as follows:

```text
TYPE <cursor_type_name> IS REF CURSOR [RETURN <return_type>];
```

The following is an example of a cursor variable declaration.

```text
DECLARE
    TYPE emp_cur_type IS REF CURSOR RETURN emp%ROWTYPE;
    my_rec emp_cur_type;
        ...
```
