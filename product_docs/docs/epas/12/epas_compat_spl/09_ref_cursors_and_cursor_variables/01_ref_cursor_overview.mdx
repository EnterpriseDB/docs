A *cursor variable* is a cursor that actually contains a pointer to a query result set. The result set is determined by the execution of the `OPEN FOR` statement using the cursor variable.

A cursor variable is not tied to a single particular query like a static cursor. The same cursor variable may be opened a number of times with `OPEN FOR` statements containing different queries. Each time, a new result set is created from that query and made available via the cursor variable.

`REF CURSOR` types may be passed as parameters to or from stored procedures and functions. The return type of a function may also be a `REF CURSOR` type. This provides the capability to modularize the operations on a cursor into separate programs by passing a cursor variable between programs.
