The `CASE` statement executes a set of one or more statements when a specified search condition is `TRUE`. The `CASE` statement is a stand-alone statement in itself while the previously discussed `CASE` expression must appear as part of an expression.

There are two formats of the `CASE` statement - one that is called a *searched* `CASE` and the other that uses a *selector*.
