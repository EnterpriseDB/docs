```text
FOR <name> IN [REVERSE] <expression .. expression> LOOP
    <statements>
END LOOP;
```

This form of `FOR` creates a loop that iterates over a range of integer values. The variable `name` is automatically defined as type `INTEGER` and exists only inside the loop. The two expressions giving the loop range are evaluated once when entering the loop. The iteration step is +1 and `name` begins with the value of `expression` to the left of .. and terminates once `name` exceeds the value of `expression` to the right of ... Thus the two expressions take on the following roles: `start-value.. end-value.`

The optional `REVERSE` clause specifies that the loop should iterate in reverse order. The first time through the loop, `name` is set to the value of the right-most `expression`; the loop terminates when the `name` is less than the left-most `expression`.

The following example simplifies the `WHILE` loop example even further by using a `FOR` loop that iterates from 1 to 10.

```text
BEGIN
    FOR i IN 1 .. 10 LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Iteration # ' || i);
    END LOOP;
END;
```

Here is the output using the `FOR` statement.

```text
Iteration # 1
Iteration # 2
Iteration # 3
Iteration # 4
Iteration # 5
Iteration # 6
Iteration # 7
Iteration # 8
Iteration # 9
Iteration # 10
```

If the start value is greater than the end value the loop body is not executed at all. No error is raised as shown by the following example.

```text
BEGIN
    FOR i IN 10 .. 1 LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Iteration # ' || i);
    END LOOP;
END;
```

There is no output from this example as the loop body is never executed.

!!! Note
    SPL also supports `CURSOR` FOR loops (see [Cursor FOR Loop](../../08_static_cursors/07_cursor_for_loop/#cursor_for_loop)).
