Records can be declared based upon a table definition using the `%ROWTYPE` attribute as shown in [Using %ROWTYPE in Record Declarations](03_using__row_type_in_record_declarations/#%5Busing%5D()%25_row_type_in_record_declarations). This section describes how a new record structure can be defined that is not tied to any particular table definition.

The `TYPE IS RECORD` statement is used to create the definition of a record type. A *record type* is a definition of a record comprised of one or more identifiers and their corresponding data types. A record type cannot, by itself, be used to manipulate data.

The syntax for a `TYPE IS RECORD` statement is:

```text
TYPE <rec_type> IS RECORD ( <fields> )
```

Where `fields` is a comma-separated list of one or more field definitions of the following form:

```text
<field_name> <data_type> [NOT NULL][{:= | DEFAULT} <default_value>]
```

Where:

`rec_type`

 `rec_type` is an identifier assigned to the record type.

`field_name`

 `field_name` is the identifier assigned to the field of the record type.

`data_type`

 `data_type` specifies the data type of `field_name`.

`DEFAULT default_value`

 The `DEFAULT` clause assigns a default data value for the corresponding field. The data type of the default expression must match the data type of the column. If no default is specified, then the default is `NULL`.

A *record variable* or simply put, a *record*, is an instance of a record type. A record is declared from a record type. The properties of the record such as its field names and types are inherited from the record type.

The following is the syntax for a record declaration.

```text
<record> <rectype>
```

`record` is an identifier assigned to the record variable. `rectype` is the identifier of a previously defined record type. Once declared, a record can then be used to hold data.

Dot notation is used to make reference to the fields in the record.

```text
<record>.<field>
```

`record` is a previously declared record variable and `field` is the identifier of a field belonging to the record type from which `record` is defined.

The `emp_sal_query` is again modified â€“ this time using a user-defined record type and record variable.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE emp_sal_query (
    p_empno         IN emp.empno%TYPE
)
IS
    TYPE emp_typ IS RECORD (
        ename       emp.ename%TYPE,
        job         emp.job%TYPE,
        hiredate    emp.hiredate%TYPE,
        sal         emp.sal%TYPE,
        deptno      emp.deptno%TYPE
    );
    r_emp           emp_typ;
    v_avgsal        emp.sal%TYPE;
BEGIN
    SELECT ename, job, hiredate, sal, deptno
        INTO r_emp.ename, r_emp.job, r_emp.hiredate, r_emp.sal, r_emp.deptno
        FROM emp WHERE empno = p_empno;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee # : ' || p_empno);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Name       : ' || r_emp.ename);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Job        : ' || r_emp.job);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hire Date  : ' || r_emp.hiredate);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Salary     : ' || r_emp.sal);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Dept #     : ' || r_emp.deptno);

    SELECT AVG(sal) INTO v_avgsal
        FROM emp WHERE deptno = r_emp.deptno;
    IF r_emp.sal > v_avgsal THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee''s salary is more than the '
            || 'department average of ' || v_avgsal);
    ELSE
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee''s salary does not exceed the '
            || 'department average of ' || v_avgsal);
    END IF;
END;
```

Note that instead of specifying data type names, the `%TYPE` attribute can be used for the field data types in the record type definition.

The following is the output from executing this stored procedure.

```text
EXEC emp_sal_query(7698);

Employee # : 7698
Name       : BLAKE
Job        : MANAGER
Hire Date  : 01-MAY-81 00:00:00
Salary     : 2850.00
Dept #     : 30
Employee's salary is more than the department average of 1566.67
```
