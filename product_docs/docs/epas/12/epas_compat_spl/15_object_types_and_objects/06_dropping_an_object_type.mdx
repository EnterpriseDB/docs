<div id="dropping_an_object_type" class="registered_link"></div>

The syntax for deleting an object type is as follows.

```text
DROP TYPE <objtype>;
```

`objtype` is the identifier of the object type to be dropped. If the definition of `objtype` contains attributes that are themselves object types or collection types, these nested object types or collection types must be dropped last.

If an object type body is defined for the object type, the `DROP TYPE` command deletes the object type body as well as the object type specification. In order to recreate the complete object type, both the `CREATE TYPE` and `CREATE TYPE BODY` commands must be reissued.

The following example drops the `emp_obj_typ` and the `addr_obj_typ` object types created earlier in this chapter. `emp_obj_typ` must be dropped first since it contains `addr_obj_typ` within its definition as an attribute.

```text
DROP TYPE emp_obj_typ;
DROP TYPE addr_obj_typ;
```

The syntax for deleting an object type body, but not the object type specification is as follows.

```text
DROP TYPE BODY <objtype>;
```

The object type body can be recreated by issuing the `CREATE TYPE BODY` command.

The following example drops only the object type body of the `dept_obj_typ.`

```text
DROP TYPE BODY dept_obj_typ;
```
