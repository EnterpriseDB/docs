| Bug fix        | Set correct object descriptions for redaction policy to make pg_dump work cleanly with `--clean` and `--if-exists` options.                                              |          |

| Bug fix        | Fixed assertion failure while terminating the process within the autonomous transaction.                                                                                 |          |

| Bug fix        | Fixed memory leakage in anonymous blocks that use cast expressions. [Support ticket: #88816]                                                                             |          |
