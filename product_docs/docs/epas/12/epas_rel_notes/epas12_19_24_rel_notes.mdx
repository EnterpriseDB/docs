| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue for `edb_filter_log`. Now it correctly redacts the password when the tab is used before the keyword. [Support ticket: #36220] | |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue for `edb_audit` on Windows. Now it correctly rotates the log files based on days configured in `edb_audit_rotation_day`. [Support ticket: #99282]| |
