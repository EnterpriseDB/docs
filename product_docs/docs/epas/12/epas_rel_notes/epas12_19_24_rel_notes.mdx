| Upstream merge | Merged with community PostgreSQL 12.19. Important: this release includes a fix for [CVE-2024-4317](/security/assessments/cve-2024-4317). See the [PostgreSQL 12.19 Release Notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/12.19/) for more information. |          |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue for `edb_filter_log`. Now it correctly redacts the password when the tab is used before the keyword. [Support ticket: #36220] | |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue for `edb_audit` on Windows. Now it correctly rotates the log files based on days configured in `edb_audit_rotation_day`. [Support ticket: #99282]| |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue to fetch all the attributes correctly from the sub link in `CONNECT BY` processing to avoid the server crash. [Support ticket: 102746] | |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Added conditional free path in `add_path()` to avoid the rare possible server crashes when the free path is still in use, specially in the FDWs. [Support ticket: #86497] | |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed a crash issue for `edbldr`. Now `edbldr` loads data into multiple tables with different encodings from the target database. |  |
