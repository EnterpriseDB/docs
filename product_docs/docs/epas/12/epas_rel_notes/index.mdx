## EDB Postgres Advanced Server v12 Features

The major highlights of this release are :

-   Advanced Server now supports interval partitioning. Interval partitioning is an extension to range partitioning where the system automatically creates the partition if a new tuple doesn't fit into existing partitions.
-   For better Redwood compatibility, Advanced Server now treats the `SELECT UNIQUE` clause synonymous to `SELECT DISTINCT` clause (i.e. they can be used interchangeably in all places).
-   Advanced Server now supports `COMPOUND TRIGGERS`. This provides a way to define a single trigger on a table that enables the user to specify actions for different DML event points. It allows defining `BEFORE STATEMENT`, `AFTER STATEMENT`, `BEFORE EACH ROW`, `AFTER EACH ROW` timing events in a single trigger.
-   Advanced Server allows logical decoding on a standby server. With this feature, the user can now create a logical replication slot on standby server. 
-   Advanced Server now provides `CAST(MULTISET..)`. `CAST(MULTISET)` is an extension to the redwood style casting function `CAST(.. AS ..)` where the subquery result is like a table output `CAST` to a collection type.
-   Advanced Server now supports two aggregate functions: `LISTAGG` and `MEDIAN`.
-   The `LISTAGG` function supports string aggregation that concatenates data from multiple rows into a single row in an ordered fashion.
-   The `MEDIAN` function calculates a median value from the set of provided values. The aggregate function can be used with numeric, date/time and interval types and much like other aggregate functions, it can be used with window function as well.
-   In addition to supporting `%type` and `%rowtype` variables for functions and procedures, Advanced Server now supports the same inside a package as well.
-   Advanced Server now supports a Redwood compatible `to_timestamp` implementation, which facilitates stricter input string parsing for timestamp columns for EDB Loader.
-   Advanced Server has re-implemented `ROWIDs` using identity data type after PG v12 PostgreSQL community removed support for `OIDs` (to which `ROWIDs` were mapped).
-   Advanced Server has added the `SYS_GUID` function to generate and return a globally unique identifier in the form of 16-bytes of RAW data.
-   Advanced Server now offers new view that provide information which is compatible with the Oracle data dictionary views:
    
    `{USER|ALL|DBA}_TAB_PRIVS`

    `{USER|ALL|DBA}_COL_PRIVS`

    `{USER|ALL|DBA}_TAB_DEPENDENCIES`

### Community PostgreSQL 12 Updates

Advanced Server 12 integrates all of the community PostgreSQL 12 features. To review a complete list of changes to the community PostgreSQL project and the contributors names, see the PostgreSQL 12 Release Notes at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/release-12.html>

The following updates are available in PostgreSQL 12:

### Partitioning Updates

Improve performance of many operations on partitioned tables.

Allow tables with thousands of child partitions to be processed efficiently by operations that only affect a small number of partitions.

Allow foreign keys to reference partitioned tables.

Improve speed of `COPY` into partitioned tables.

Allow partition bounds to be any expression.

Such expressions are evaluated at partitioned-table creation time. Previously, only simple constants were allowed as partition bounds.

Allow `CREATE TABLE's` tablespace specification for a partitioned table to affect the tablespace of its children.

Avoid sorting when partitions are already being scanned in the necessary order.

`ALTER TABLE ATTACH PARTITION` is now performed with reduced locking requirements.

Add partition introspection functions.

The new function `pg_partition_root()` returns the top-most parent of a partition tree, `pg_partition_ancestors()` reports all ancestors of a partition, and `pg_partition_tree()` displays information about partitions.

Include partitioned indexes in the system view `pg_indexes`.

Add psql command `\dP` to list partitioned tables and indexes.

Improve psql `\d` and `\z` display of partitioned tables.

Fix bugs that could cause `ALTER TABLE DETACH PARTITION` to leave behind incorrect dependency state, allowing subsequent operations to misbehave, for example by not dropping a former partition child index when its table is dropped.

### Indexes

Improve performance and space utilization of btree indexes with many duplicates.

Previously, duplicate index entries were stored unordered within their duplicate groups. This caused overhead during index inserts, wasted space due to excessive page splits, and it reduced `VACUUM's` ability to recycle entire pages. Duplicate index entries are now sorted in heap-storage order.

Indexes `pg_upgrade'd` from previous releases will not have these benefits.

Allow multi-column btree indexes to be smaller.

Internal pages and min/max leaf page indicators now only store index keys until the change key, rather than all indexed keys. This also improves the locality of index access.

Improve speed of btree index insertions by reducing locking overhead.

Support `INCLUDE` columns in `GiST` indexes.

Add support for nearest-neighbor `(KNN)` searches of `SP-GiST` indexes.

Reduce the WAL write overhead of `GiST`, `GIN`, and `SP-GiST` index creation.

Allow index-only scans to be more efficient on indexes with many columns.

Improve the performance of vacuum scans of `GiST` indexes.

Delete empty leaf pages during `GiST VACUUM`.

Reduce locking requirements for index renaming.

### Optimizer

Allow `CREATE STATISTICS` to create most-common-value statistics for multiple columns.

This improves optimization for queries that test several columns, requiring an estimate of the combined effect of several `WHERE` clauses. If the columns are correlated and have non-uniform distributions then multi-column statistics will allow much better estimates.

Allow common table expressions (CTEs) to be inlined into the outer query.

Specifically, CTEs are automatically inlined if they have no side-effects, are not recursive, and are referenced only once in the query. Inlining can be prevented by specifying `MATERIALIZED`, or forced for multiply-referenced CTEs by specifying `NOT MATERIALIZED`. Previously, CTEs were never inlined and were always evaluated before the rest of the query.

Allow control over when generic plans are used for prepared statements.

This is controlled by the `plan_cache_mode` server parameter.

Improve optimization of partition and `UNION ALL` queries that have only a single child.

Improve processing of domains that have no check constraints.

Domains that are being used purely as type aliases no longer cause optimization difficulties.

Pre-evaluate calls of `LEAST` and `GREATEST` when their arguments are constants.

Improve optimizer's ability to verify that partial indexes with IS `NOT NULL` conditions are usable in queries.

Usability can now be recognized in more cases where the calling query involves casts or large `x IN (array)` clauses.

Compute `ANALYZE` statistics using the collation defined for each column.

Previously, the database's default collation was used for all statistics. This potentially gives better optimizer behavior for columns with non-default collations.

Improve selectivity estimates for inequality comparisons on `ctid` columns.

Improve optimization of joins on columns of type `tid`.

These changes primarily improve the efficiency of self-joins on `ctid` columns.

Fix the leakproofness designations of some btree comparison operators and support functions.

This allows some optimizations that previously would not have been applied in the presence of security barrier views or row-level security.

### General Performance

Enable Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation by default, if the server has been built with support for it.

Note that this support is not built by default, but has to be selected explicitly while configuring the build.

Speed up keyword lookup.

Improve search performance for multi-byte characters in `position()` and related functions.

Allow toasted values to be minimally decompressed.

This is useful for routines that only need to examine the initial portion of a toasted field.

Allow `ALTER TABLE ... SET NOT NULL` to avoid unnecessary table scans.

This can be optimized when the table's column constraints can be recognized as disallowing nulls.

Allow `ALTER TABLE ... SET DATA TYPE` changing between timestamp and timestamptz to avoid a table rewrite when the session time zone is UTC.

In the UTC time zone, these two data types are binary compatible.

Improve speed in converting strings to `int2` or `int4` integers.

Allow parallelized queries when in `SERIALIZABLE` isolation mode.

Previously, parallelism was disabled when in this mode.

Use `pread()` and `pwrite()` for random I/O.

This reduces the number of system calls required for I/O.

Improve the speed of setting the process title on FreeBSD.

### Monitoring

Allow logging of statements from only a percentage of transactions.

The parameter `log_transaction_sample_rate` controls this.

Add progress reporting to `CREATE INDEX` and `REINDEX` operations.

Progress is reported in the `pg_stat_progress_create_index` system view.

Add progress reporting to `CLUSTER` and `VACUUM FULL`.

Progress is reported in the `pg_stat_progress_cluster` system view.

Add progress reporting to `pg_checksums`.

This is enabled with the option `--progress`.

Add counter of checksum failures to `pg_stat_database`.

Add tracking of global objects in system view `pg_stat_database`.

Global objects are shown with a `pg_stat_database.datid` value of zero.

Add the ability to list the contents of the archive directory.

The function is `pg_ls_archive_statusdir()`.

Add the ability to list the contents of temporary directories.

The function, `pg_ls_tmpdir()`, optionally allows specification of a tablespace.

Add information about the client certificate to the system view `pg_stat_ssl`.

The new columns are `client_serial` and `issuer_dn`. Column `clientdn` has been renamed to `client_dn` for clarity.

Restrict visibility of rows in `pg_stat_ssl` for unprivileged users.

At server start, emit a log message including the server version number.

Prevent logging "incomplete startup packet" if a new connection is immediately closed.

This avoids log spam from certain forms of monitoring.

Include the `application_name`, if set, in `log_connections` log messages.

Make the walreceiver set its application name to the cluster name, if set.

Add the timestamp of the last received standby message to `pg_stat_replication`.

Add a wait event for `fsync` of WAL segments.

### Authentication

Add GSSAPI encryption support.

This feature allows TCP/IP connections to be encrypted when using GSSAPI authentication, without having to set up a separate encryption facility such as SSL. In support of this, add hostgssenc and hostnogssenc record types in `pg_hba.conf` for selecting connections that do or do not use GSSAPI encryption, corresponding to the existing hostssl and hostnossl record types. There is also a new `gssencmode` libpq option, and a `pg_stat_gssapi` system view.

Allow the clientcert `pg_hba.conf` option to check that the database user name matches the client certificate's common name.

This new check is enabled with `clientcert=verify-full`.

Allow discovery of an LDAP server using DNS SRV records.

This avoids the requirement of specifying ldapserver. It is only supported if PostgreSQL is compiled with OpenLDAP.

### Server Configuration

Add ability to enable/disable cluster checksums using `pg_checksums`.

The cluster must be shut down for these operations.

Reduce the default value of `autovacuum_vacuum_cost_delay` to 2ms.

This allows autovacuum operations to proceed faster by default.

Allow `vacuum_cost_delay` to specify sub-millisecond delays, by accepting fractional values.

Allow time-based server parameters to use units of microseconds (us).

Allow fractional input for integer server parameters.

For example, `SET work_mem = '30.1GB'` is now allowed, even though `work_mem` is an integer parameter. The value will be rounded to an integer after any required units conversion.

Allow units to be defined for floating-point server parameters.

Add `wal_recycle` and `wal_init_zero` server parameters to control WAL file recycling.

Avoiding file recycling can be beneficial on copy-on-write file systems like ZFS.

Add server parameter `tcp_user_timeout` to control the server's TCP timeout.

Allow control of the minimum and maximum SSL protocol versions.

The server parameters are `ssl_min_protocol_version` and `ssl_max_protocol_version`.

Add server parameter `ssl_library` to report the SSL library version used by the server.

Add server parameter `shared_memory_type` to control the type of shared memory to use.

This allows selection of System V shared memory, if desired.

### Streaming Replication And Recovery

Allow some recovery parameters to be changed with reload.

These parameters are `archive_cleanup_command`, `promote_trigger_file`, `recovery_end_command`, and `recovery_min_apply_delay`.

Allow the streaming replication timeout `(wal_sender_timeout)` to be set per connection.

Previously, this could only be set cluster-wide.

Add function `pg_promote()` to promote standbys to primaries.

Previously, this operation was only possible by using `pg_ctl` or creating a trigger file.

Allow replication slots to be copied.

The functions for this are `pg_copy_physical_replication_slot()` and `pg_copy_logical_replication_slot()`.

Make `max_wal_senders` not count as part of `max_connections`.

Add an explicit value of current for `recovery_target_timeline`.

Make recovery fail if a two-phase transaction status file is corrupt.

Previously, a warning was logged and recovery continued, allowing the transaction to be lost.

### Utility Commands

Add `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` option to allow reindexing without locking out writes.

This is also controlled by the reindexdb application's --concurrently option.

Add support for generated columns.

The content of generated columns are computed from expressions (including references to other columns in the same table) rather than being specified by `INSERT` or `UPDATE` commands.

Add a `WHERE` clause to `COPY FROM` to control which rows are accepted.

This provides a simple way to filter incoming data.

Allow enumerated values to be added more flexibly.

Previously, `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE` could not be called in a transaction block, unless it was part of the same transaction that created the enumerated type. Now it can be called in a later transaction, so long as the new enumerated value is not referenced until after it is committed.

Add commands to end a transaction and start a new one.

The commands are `COMMIT AND CHAIN` and `ROLLBACK AND CHAIN`.

Add `VACUUM` and `CREATE TABLE` options to prevent `VACUUM` from truncating trailing empty pages.

These options are `vacuum_truncate` and `toast.vacuum_truncate`. Use of these options reduces `VACUUM's` locking requirements, but prevents returning disk space to the operating system.

Allow `VACUUM` to skip index cleanup.

This change adds a `VACUUM` command option `INDEX_CLEANUP` as well as a table storage option `vacuum_index_cleanup`. Use of this option reduces the ability to reclaim space and can lead to index bloat, but it is helpful when the main goal is to freeze old tuples.

Add the ability to skip `VACUUM` and `ANALYZE` operations on tables that cannot be locked immediately.

This option is called `SKIP_LOCKED`.

Allow `VACUUM` and `ANALYZE` to take optional Boolean argument specifications.

Prevent `TRUNCATE`, `VACUUM`, and `ANALYZE` from requesting a lock on tables for which the user lacks permission.

This prevents unauthorized locking, which could interfere with user queries.

Add `EXPLAIN` option `SETTINGS` to output non-default optimizer settings.

This output can also be obtained when using `auto_explain` by setting `auto_explain.log_settings`.

Add `OR REPLACE` option to `CREATE AGGREGATE`.

Allow modifications of system catalogs' options using `ALTER TABLE`.

Modifications of catalogs' reloptions and autovacuum settings are now supported. (Setting `allow_system_table_mods` is still required.)

Use all key columns' names when selecting default constraint names for foreign keys.

Previously, only the first column name was included in the constraint name, resulting in ambiguity for multi-column foreign keys.

### Data Types

Update assorted knowledge about Unicode to match Unicode 12.1.0.

This fixes, for example, cases where psql would misformat output involving combining characters.

Update Snowball stemmer dictionaries with support for new languages.

This adds word stemming support for Arabic, Indonesian, Irish, Lithuanian, Nepali, and Tamil to full text search.

Allow creation of collations that report string equality for strings that are not bitwise equal.

This feature supports "nondeterministic" collations that can define case- and accent-agnostic equality comparisons. Thus, for example, a case-insensitive uniqueness constraint on a text column can be made more easily than before. This is only supported for ICU collations.

Add support for ICU collation attributes on older ICU versions.

This allows customization of the collation rules in a consistent way across all ICU versions.

Allow data type name to more seamlessly be compared to other text types.

Type name now behaves much like a domain over type text that has default collation "C". This allows cross-type comparisons to be processed more efficiently.

### Functions

Add support for the SQL/JSON path language.

This allows execution of complex queries on JSON values using an SQL-standard language.

Add support for hyperbolic functions.

Also add `log10()` as an alias for `log()`, for standards compliance.

Improve the accuracy of statistical aggregates like variance() by using more precise algorithms.

Allow `date_trunc()` to have an additional argument to control the time zone.

This is faster and simpler than using the `AT TIME ZONE` clause.

Adjust `to_timestamp()`/`to_date()` functions to be more forgiving of template mismatches.

This new behavior more closely matches the Oracle functions of the same name.

### Fix assorted bugs in XML functions

Specifically, in `XMLTABLE`, `xpath()`, and `xmlexists()`, fix some cases where nothing was output for a node, or an unexpected error was thrown, or necessary escaping of XML special characters was omitted.

Allow the `BY VALUE` clause in `XMLEXISTS` and `XMLTABLE`.

This SQL-standard clause has no effect in PostgreSQL's implementation, but it was unnecessarily being rejected.

Prevent `current_schema()` and `current_schemas()` from being run by parallel workers, as they are not parallel-safe.

Allow `RECORD` and `RECORD[]` to be used as column types in a query's column definition list for a table function that is declared to return `RECORD`.

### PL/PgSQL

Allow SQL commands and variables with the same names as those commands to be used in the same PL/pgSQL function.

For example, allow a variable called comment to exist in a function that calls the `COMMENT SQL` command. Previously this combination caused a parse error.

Add new optional warning and error checks to PL/pgSQL.

The new checks allow for run-time validation of `INTO` column counts and single-row results.

### Client Interfaces

Add connection parameter `tcp_user_timeout` to control libpq's TCP timeout.

Allow libpq (and thus psql) to report only the SQLSTATE value in error messages.

Add libpq function `PQresultMemorySize()` to report the memory used by a query result.

Remove the no-display/debug flag from libpq's options connection parameter.

This allows this parameter to be set by `postgres_fdw`.

Allow ecpg to create variables of data type bytea.

This allows ECPG clients to interact with bytea data directly, rather than using an encoded form.

Add `PREPARE AS` support to ECPG.

### Client Applications

Allow vacuumdb to select tables for vacuum based on their wraparound horizon.

The options are `--min-xid-age` and `--min-mxid-age`.

Allow vacuumdb to disable waiting for locks or skipping all-visible pages.

The options are `--skip-locked` and `--disable-page-skipping`.

Add colorization to the output of command-line utilities.

This is enabled by setting the environment variable `PG_COLOR` to always or auto. The specific colors used can be adjusted by setting the environment variable `PG_COLORS`, using ANSI escape codes for colors. For example, the default behavior is equivalent to `PG_COLORS="error=01;31:warning=01;35:locus=01"`.

### psql

Add CSV table output mode in psql.

This is controlled by `\pset` format csv or the command-line `--csv` option.

Show the manual page URL in psql's `\help` output for a SQL command.

Display the IP address in psql's `\conninfo` (Fabien Coelho).

Improve tab completion of `CREATE TABLE`, `CREATE TRIGGER`, `CREATE EVENT TRIGGER`, `ANALYZE`, `EXPLAIN`, `VACUUM`, `ALTER TABLE`, `ALTER INDEX`, `ALTER DATABASE`, and `ALTER INDEX ALTER COLUMN`.

### pgbench

Allow values produced by queries to be assigned to pgbench variables.

The command for this is `\gset`.

Improve precision of pgbench's `--rate` option.

Improve pgbench's error reporting with clearer messages and return codes.

### Server Applications

Allow control of log file rotation via `pg_ctl`.

Previously, this was only possible via an SQL function or a process signal.

Properly detach the new server process during `pg_ctl` start.

This prevents the server from being shut down if the shell script that invoked `pg_ctl` is interrupted later.

Allow `pg_upgrade` to use the file system's cloning feature, if there is one.

The `--clone` option has the advantages of `--link`, while preventing the old cluster from being changed after the new cluster has started.

Allow specification of the socket directory to use in `pg_upgrade`.

This is controlled by `--socketdir`; the default is the current directory.

Allow `pg_checksums` to disable `fsync` operations.

This is controlled by the `--no-sync` option.

Allow `pg_rewind` to disable `fsync` operations.

Fix `pg_test_fsync` to report accurate `open_datasync` durations on Windows.

### pg_dump, pg_dumpall, pg_restore

When `pg_dump` emits data with `INSERT` commands rather than `COPY`, allow more than one data row to be included in each `INSERT`.

The option controlling this is `--rows-per-insert`.

Allow `pg_dump` to emit `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`.

This avoids conflict failures during restore. The option is `--on-conflict-do-nothing`.

Decouple the order of operations in a parallel `pg_dump` from the order used by a subsequent parallel `pg_restore`.

This allows `pg_restore` to perform more-fully-parallelized parallel restores, especially in cases where the original dump was not done in parallel. Scheduling of a parallel `pg_dump` is also somewhat improved.

Allow the `extra_float_digits` setting to be specified for `pg_dump` and `pg_dumpall`.

This is primarily useful for making dumps that are exactly comparable across different source server versions. It is not recommended for normal use, as it may result in loss of precision when the dump is restored.

Add `--exclude-database` option to `pg_dumpall`.

### Source Code

Add `CREATE ACCESS METHOD` command to create new table types.

This enables the development of new table access methods, which can optimize storage for different use cases. The existing heap access method remains the default.

Add planner support function interfaces to improve optimizer estimates, inlining, and indexing for functions.

This allows extensions to create planner support functions that can provide function-specific selectivity, cost, and row-count estimates that can depend on the function's arguments. Support functions can also supply simplified representations and index conditions, greatly expanding optimization possibilities.

Simplify renumbering manually-assigned `OIDs`, and establish a new project policy for management of such `OIDs`.

Patches that manually assign `OIDs` for new built-in objects (such as new functions) should now randomly choose `OIDs` in the range 8000â€”9999. At the end of a development cycle, the OIDs used by committed patches will be renumbered down to lower numbers, currently somewhere in the 4xxx range, using the new `renumber_oids.pl` script. This approach should greatly reduce the odds of `OID` collisions between different in-process patches.

While there is no specific policy reserving any `OIDs` for external use, it is recommended that forks and other projects needing private manually-assigned `OIDs` use numbers in the high 7xxx range. This will avoid conflicts with recently-merged patches, and it should be a long time before the core project reaches that range.

Build Cygwin binaries using dynamic instead of static libraries.

Remove configure switch `--disable-strong-random`.

A strong random-number source is now required.

printf-family functions, as well as `strerror` and `strerror_r`, now behave uniformly across platforms within Postgres code.

Notably, `printf` understands `%m` everywhere; on Windows, `strerror` copes with Winsock error codes (it used to do so in backend but not frontend code); and `strerror_r` always follows the GNU return convention.

Require a C99-compliant compiler, and MSVC 2013 or later on Windows.

Use pandoc, not lynx, for generating plain-text documentation output files.

This affects only the `INSTALL file` generated during make dist and the seldom-used plain-text `postgres.txt` output file. Pandoc produces better output than lynx and avoids some locale/encoding issues. Pandoc version 1.13 or later is required.

Support use of images in the PostgreSQL documentation.

### Additional Modules

Allow `ORDER BY` sorts and `LIMIT` clauses to be pushed to `postgres_fdw` foreign servers in more cases.

Improve optimizer cost accounting for `postgres_fdw` queries.

Properly honor `WITH CHECK OPTION` on views that reference `postgres_fdw` tables.

While `CHECK OPTIONs` on `postgres_fdw` tables are ignored (because the reference is foreign), views on such tables are considered local, so this change enforces `CHECK OPTIONs` on them.
