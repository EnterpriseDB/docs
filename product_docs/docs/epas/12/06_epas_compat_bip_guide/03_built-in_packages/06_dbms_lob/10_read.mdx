title: "READ"
---



The `READ` procedure provides the capability to read a portion of a large object into a buffer.

    READ(<lob_loc> { BLOB | CLOB }, <amount> IN OUT BINARY_INTEGER,
      <offset> INTEGER, <buffer> OUT { RAW | VARCHAR2 })

**Parameters**

`lob_loc`

> Large object locator of the large object to be read.

`amount IN`

> Number of bytes/characters to read.

`amount OUT`

> Number of bytes/characters actually read. If there is no more data to be read, then `amount` returns 0 and a `DATA_NOT_FOUND` exception is thrown.

`offset`

> Position to begin reading. The first byte/character is position 1.

`buffer`

> Variable to receive the large object. If `lob_loc` is a `BLOB`, then `buffer` must be `RAW`. If `lob_loc` is a `CLOB`, then `buffer` must be `VARCHAR2`.
