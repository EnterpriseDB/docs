title: "Using Calendar Syntax to Specify a Repeating Interval"
---

The `CREATE_JOB` and `CREATE_SCHEDULE` procedures use Oracle-styled calendar syntax to define the interval with which a job or schedule is repeated. You should provide the scheduling information in the `repeat_interval` parameter of each procedure.

`repeat_interval` is a value (or series of values) that define the interval between the executions of the scheduled job. Each value is composed of a token, followed by an equal sign, followed by the unit (or units) on which the schedule will execute. Multiple token values must be separated by a semi-colon (;).

For example, the following value:

> `FREQ=DAILY;BYDAY=MON,TUE,WED,THU,FRI;BYHOUR=17;BYMINUTE=45`

Defines a schedule that is executed each weeknight at 5:45.

The token types and syntax described in the table below are supported by Advanced Server:
