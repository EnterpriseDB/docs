A dump/restore using `pg_dumpall` or `pg_upgrade` or logical replication is required for migrating data from any previous release. See [Upgrading an Installation With pg_upgrade](04_upgrading_an_installation_with_pg_upgrade/#upgrading_an_installation_with_pg_upgrade) for information on migrating to new major releases.

Version 12 contains a number of changes that may affect compatibility with previous releases. Listed is the following incompatibilities:

-   Remove the special behavior of `oid` columns.

    Previously, a normally-invisible `oid`column could be specified during table creation using `WITH OIDS`; that ability has been removed. Columns can still be explicitly declared as type oid. Operations on tables that have columns created using `WITH OIDS` will need adjustment.

    The system catalogs that previously had hidden `oid`columns now have ordinary `oid` columns. Hence, `SELECT *` will now output those columns, whereas previously they would be displayed only if selected explicitly.

-   Remove data types `abstime, reltime,` and `tinterval`.

    These are obsoleted by SQL-standard types such as `timestamp`.

-   Move `recovery.conf` settings into `postgresql.conf`.

    `recovery.conf`is no longer used, and the server will not start if that file exists. `recovery.signal` and `standby.signal` files are now used to switch into non-primary mode. The `trigger_file` setting has been renamed to `promote_trigger_file`. The `standby_mode` setting has been removed. 
    
-   Do not allow multiple conflicting `recovery_target* specifications.

    Specifically, only allow one of `recovery_target, recovery_target_lsn, recovery_target_name, recovery_target_time,` and `recovery_target_xid`. Previously, multiple different instances of these parameters could be specified, and the last one was honored. Now, only one can be specified, though the same one can be specified multiple times and the last specification is honored.
    
-   Cause recovery to advance to the latest timeline by default.

    Specifically, `recovery_target_timeline` now defaults to `latest`. Previously, it defaulted to `current`.

-   Refactor code for geometric functions and operators.

    This could lead to more accurate, but slightly different, results compared to previous releases. Notably, cases involving `NaN`, underflow, overflow, and division by zero are handled more consistently than before.

-  Improve performance by using a new algorithm for output of `real` and `double precision` values. 

    Previously, displayed floating-point values were rounded to 6 (for `real`) or 15 (for `double precision`) digits by default, adjusted by the value of `extra_float_digits`. Now, whenever `extra_float_digits` is more than zero (as it now is by default), only the minimum number of digits required to preserve the exact binary value are output. The behavior is the same as before when `extra_float_digits` is set to zero or less. 
    
    Also, formatting of floating-point exponents is now uniform across platforms: two digits are used unless three are necessary. In previous releases, Windows builds always printed three digits.

-  `random()` and `setseed()` now behave uniformly across platforms.

    The sequence of `random()` values generated following a setseed() call with a
    particular seed value is likely to be different now than before. However, it will
    also be repeatable, which was not previously guaranteed because of interference
    from other uses of random numbers inside the server. The SQL `random()` 
    function now has its own private per-session state to forestall that.

-   Change SQL-style `substring()` to have standard-compliant greediness behavior.

    In cases where the pattern can be matched in more than one way, the initial subpattern is now treated as matching the least possible amount of text rather than the
    greatest; for example, a pattern such as `%#"aa*#"%` now selects the first group
    of a's from the input, not the last group.

-   Do not pretty-print the result of `xpath()` or the `XMLTABLE` construct.

    In some cases, these functions would insert extra whitespace (newlines and/or
    spaces) in nodeset values. This is undesirable since depending on usage, the
    whitespace might be considered semantically significant.

- Rename command-line tool `pg_verify_checksums` to `pg_checksums`.

-   In `pg_restore`, require specification of `-f -` to send the dump contents to
standard output.

    Previously, this happened by default if no destination was specified, but that was
    deemed to be unfriendly.

-  Disallow non-unique abbreviations in psql's `\pset format` command.

    Previously, for example, `\pset format` a chose `aligned`; it will now fail since
    that could equally well mean `asciidoc`.

-   In new `btree` indexes, the maximum index entry length is reduced by eight bytes,
to improve handling of duplicate entries.

This means that a `REINDEX` operation on an index `pg_upgrade'd from a
previous release could potentially fail.
