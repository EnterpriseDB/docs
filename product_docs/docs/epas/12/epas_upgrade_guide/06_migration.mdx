A dump/restore using `pg_dumpall` or `pg_upgrade` or logical replication is required for migrating data from any previous release. See [Upgrading an Installation With pg_upgrade](03_upgrading_an_installation_with_pg_upgrade/#upgrading_an_installation_with_pg_upgrade) for information on migrating to new major releases.

Version 12 contains a number of changes that may affect compatibility with previous releases. Listed is the following incompatibilities:

-   Remove the special behavior of `oid` columns.

    Previously, a normally-invisible `oid`column could be specified during table creation using `WITH OIDS`; that ability has been removed. Columns can still be explicitly declared as type oid. Operations on tables that have columns created using `WITH OIDS` will need adjustment.

    The system catalogs that previously had hidden `oid`columns now have ordinary `oid` columns. Hence, `SELECT *` will now output those columns, whereas previously they would be displayed only if selected explicitly.

-   Remove data types `abstime, reltime,` and `tinterval`.

    These are obsoleted by SQL-standard types such as `timestamp`.

-  Remove the `timetravel` extension.

-   Move `recovery.conf` settings into `postgresql.conf`.

    `recovery.conf`is no longer used, and the server will not start if that file exists. `recovery.signal` and `standby.signal` files are now used to switch into non-primary mode. The `trigger_file` setting has been renamed to `promote_trigger_file`. The `standby_mode` setting has been removed. 
    
-   Do not allow multiple conflicting `recovery_target*` specifications.

    Specifically, only allow one of `recovery_target, recovery_target_lsn, recovery_target_name, recovery_target_time,` and `recovery_target_xid`. Previously, multiple different instances of these parameters could be specified, and the last one was honored. Now, only one can be specified, though the same one can be specified multiple times and the last specification is honored.
    
-   Cause recovery to advance to the latest timeline by default.

    Specifically, `recovery_target_timeline` now defaults to `latest`. Previously, it defaulted to `current`.

-   Refactor code for geometric functions and operators.

    This could lead to more accurate, but slightly different, results compared to previous releases. Notably, cases involving `NaN`, underflow, overflow, and division by zero are handled more consistently than before.

-  Improve performance by using a new algorithm for output of `real` and `double precision` values. 

    Previously, displayed floating-point values were rounded to 6 (for `real`) or 15 (for `double precision`) digits by default, adjusted by the value of `extra_float_digits`. Now, whenever `extra_float_digits` is more than zero (as it now is by default), only the minimum number of digits required to preserve the exact binary value are output. The behavior is the same as before when `extra_float_digits` is set to zero or less. 
    
    Also, formatting of floating-point exponents is now uniform across platforms: two digits are used unless three are necessary. In previous releases, Windows builds always printed three digits.

-  `random()` and `setseed()` now behave uniformly across platforms.

    The sequence of `random()` values generated following a `setseed()` call with a particular seed value is likely to be different now than before. However, it will also be repeatable, which was not previously guaranteed because of interference from other uses of random numbers inside the server. The SQL `random()` function now has its own private per-session state to forestall that.

-   Change SQL-style `substring()` to have standard-compliant greediness behavior.

    In cases where the pattern can be matched in more than one way, the initial subpattern is now treated as matching the least possible amount of text rather than the greatest; for example, a pattern such as `%#"aa*#"%` now selects the first group of a's from the input, not the last group.

-   Do not pretty-print the result of `xpath()` or the `XMLTABLE` construct.

    In some cases, these functions would insert extra whitespace (newlines and/or spaces) in nodeset values. This is undesirable since depending on usage, the whitespace might be considered semantically significant.

- Rename command-line tool `pg_verify_checksums` to `pg_checksums`.

-   In `pg_restore`, require specification of `-f -` to send the dump contents to standard output.

   Previously, this happened by default if no destination was specified, but that was deemed to be unfriendly.

-  Disallow non-unique abbreviations in psql's `\pset format` command.

   Previously, for example, `\pset format` a chose `aligned`; it will now fail since that could equally well mean `asciidoc`.

-   In new `btree` indexes, the maximum index entry length is reduced by eight bytes, to improve handling of duplicate entries.

   This means that a `REINDEX` operation on an index pg_upgrade'd from a previous release could potentially fail.

-  Cause `DROP IF EXISTS FUNCTION/PROCEDURE/AGGREGATE/ROUTINE` to generate an error if no argument list is supplied and there are multiple matching objects.

   Also improve the error message in such cases.

-  Split the `pg_statistic_ext` catalog into two catalogs, and add the `pg_stats_ext` view of it.

   This change supports hiding potentially-sensitive statistics data from unprivileged users.

-  Remove `obsolete pg_constraint.consrc` column.

   This column has been deprecated for a long time, because it did not update in response to other catalog changes (such as column renamings). The recommended way to get a text version of a check constraint's expression from `pg_constraint` is `pg_get_expr(conbin, conrelid)`. `pg_get_constraintdef()` is also a useful alternative.

-  Remove `obsolete pg_attrdef.adsrc` column.

   This column has been deprecated for a long time, because it did not update in response to other catalog changes (such as column renamings). The recommended way to get a text version of a default-value expression from `pg_attrdef` is `pg_get_expr(adbin, adrelid)`.

-  Mark table columns of type `name` as having `“C”` collation by default.

   The comparison operators for data type name can now use any collation, rather than always using `“C”` collation. To preserve the previous semantics of queries, columns of type `name` are now explicitly marked as having `“C”` collation. A side effect of this is that regular-expression operators on `name` columns will now use the `“C”` collation by default, not the database collation, to determine the behavior of locale-dependent regular expression patterns (such as `\w`). If you want non-C behavior for a regular expression on a `name` column, attach an explicit `COLLATE` clause. (For user-defined `name` columns, another possibility is to specify a different collation at table creation time; but that just moves the nonbackwards-compatibility to the comparison operators.)

- Treat `object-name` columns in the `information_schema` views as being of type `name`, not `varchar`.

   Per the SQL standard, object-name columns in the `information_schema` views are declared as being of domain type `sql_identifier`. In PostgreSQL, the underlying catalog columns are really of type name. This change makes `sql_identifier` be a domain over name, rather than `varchar` as before. This eliminates a semantic mismatch in comparison and sorting behavior, which can greatly improve the performance of queries on `information_schema` views that restrict an `object-name` column. Note however that inequality restrictions, for example:

  `SELECT ... FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name < 'foo';`

   will now use `“C”-locale` comparison semantics by default, rather than the database's default collation as before. Sorting on these columns will also follow `“C”` ordering rules. The previous behavior (and inefficiency) can be enforced by adding a `COLLATE "default"` clause.

- Remove the ability to disable dynamic shared memory.

   Specifically, `dynamic_shared_memory_type` can no longer be set to `none`.

-  Parse `libpq` integer connection parameters more strictly.

   In previous releases, using an incorrect integer value for connection parameters `connect_timeout, keepalives, keepalives_count, keep alives_idle, keepalives_interval` and `port` resulted in `libpq` either ignoring those values or failing with incorrect error messages.

-  The `SELECT DISTINCT...ORDER BY` clause of the `SELECT DISTINCT` query behavior differs after upgrade.

   If `SELECT DISTINCT` is specified or if a `SELECT` statement includes the `SELECT DISTINCT ...ORDER BY` clause then all the expressions in `ORDER BY` must be present in the select list of the `SELECT DISTINCT` query (applicable when upgrading from version 9.6 to any higher version of Advanced Server).
