title: "Selecting SQL Statements to Audit"
---

<div id="selecting_sql_statements_to_audit" class="registered_link"></div>




The `edb_audit_statement` permits inclusion of one or more, comma-separated values to control which SQL statements are to be audited. The following is the general format:

> `edb_audit_statement = 'value_1[, value_2]...'`

The comma-separated values may include or omit space characters following the comma. The values can be specified in any combination of lowercase or uppercase letters.

The basic parameter values are the following:

-   `all` – Results in the auditing and logging of every statement including any error messages on statements.
-   `none` – Disables all auditing and logging. A value of `none` overrides any other value included in the list.
-   `ddl` – Results in the auditing of all data definition language (DDL) statements (`CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP`) as well as `GRANT` and `REVOKE` data control language (DCL) statements.
-   `dml` – Results in the auditing of all data manipulation language (DML) statements (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `TRUNCATE`).
-   `select` – Results in the auditing of `SELECT` statements.
-   `rollback` – Results in the auditing of `ROLLBACK` statements.
-   `error` – Results in the logging of all error messages that occur. Unless the `error` value is included, no error messages are logged regarding any errors that occur on SQL statements related to any of the other preceding parameter values except when `all` is used.

`Data Definition Language and Data Control Language Statements` describes additional parameter values for selecting particular DDL or DCL statements for auditing.

`Data Manipulation Language Statements` describes additional parameter values for selecting particular DML statements for auditing.

If an unsupported value is included in the `edb_audit_statement` parameter, then an error occurs when applying the setting to the database server. See the database server log file for the error such as in the following example where `create materialized vw` results in the error. (The correct value is `create materialized view`.)

    2017-07-16 11:20:39 EDT LOG:  invalid value for parameter
    "edb_audit_statement": "create materialized vw, create sequence, grant"
    2017-07-16 11:20:39 EDT FATAL:  configuration file "/var/lib/edb/as13/data/
    postgresql.conf" contains errors

The following sections describe the values for the SQL language types DDL, DCL, and DML.

## Data Definition Language and Data Control Language Statements

This section describes values that can be included in the `edb_audit_statement` parameter to audit DDL and DCL statements.

The following general rules apply:

-   If the `edb_audit_statement` parameter includes either `ddl` or `all`, then all DDL statements are audited. In addition, the DCL statements `GRANT` and `REVOKE` are audited as well.
-   If the `edb_audit_statement` is set to `none`, then no DDL nor DCL statements are audited.
-   Specific types of DDL and DCL statements can be chosen for auditing by including a combination of values within the `edb_audit_statement` parameter.

Use the following syntax to specify an `edb_audit_statement` parameter value for DDL statements:

> `{ create | alter | drop } [ <object_type> ]`

`object_type` is any of the following:

> `ACCESS METHOD`
>
> `AGGREGATE`
>
> `CAST`
>
> `COLLATION`
>
> `CONVERSION`
>
> `DATABASE`
>
> `EVENT TRIGGER`
>
> `EXTENSION`
>
> `FOREIGN TABLE`
>
> `FUNCTION`
>
> `INDEX`
>
> `LANGUAGE`
>
> `LARGE OBJECT`
>
> `MATERIALIZED VIEW`
>
> `OPERATOR`
>
> `OPERATOR CLASS`
>
> `OPERATOR FAMILY`
>
> `POLICY`
>
> `PUBLICATION`
>
> `ROLE`
>
> `RULE`
>
> `SCHEMA`
>
> `SEQUENCE`
>
> `SERVER`
>
> `SUBSCRIPTION`
>
> `TABLE`
>
> `TABLESPACE`
>
> `TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION`
>
> `TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY`
>
> `TEXT SEARCH PARSER`
>
> `TEXT SEARCH TEMPLATE`
>
> `TRANSFORM`
>
> `TRIGGER`
>
> `TYPE`
>
> `USER MAPPING`
>
> `VIEW`

Descriptions of object types as used in SQL commands can be found in the PostgreSQL core documentation available at:

> <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-commands.html>

If `object_type` is omitted from the parameter value, then all of the specified command statements (either `create`, `alter`, or `drop`) are audited.

Use the following syntax to specify an `edb_audit_statement` parameter value for DCL statements:

> `{ grant | revoke }`

The following are some DDL and DCL examples.

**Example 1**

The following is an example where `edb_audit_connect` and `edb_audit_statement` are set with the following non-default values:

    logging_collector = 'on'
    edb_audit_connect = 'all'
    edb_audit_statement = 'create, alter, error'

Thus, only SQL statements invoked by the `CREATE` and `ALTER` commands are audited. Error messages are also included in the audit log.

The database session that occurs is the following:

    $ psql edb enterprisedb
    Password for user enterprisedb:
    psql.bin (13.0.0)
    Type "help" for help.

    edb=# SHOW edb_audit_connect;

    ALTER ROLE
    edb=# CREATE DATABASE auditdb;
    CREATE DATABASE
    edb=# ALTER DATABASE auditdb OWNER TO adminuser;
    ALTER DATABASE
    edb=# \c auditdb adminuser
    Password for user adminuser:
    You are now connected to database "auditdb" as user "adminuser".
    auditdb=# CREATE SCHEMA edb;
    CREATE SCHEMA
    auditdb=# SET search_path TO edb;
    SET
    auditdb=# CREATE TABLE department (
    auditdb(#  deptno          NUMBER(2) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT dept_pk PRIMARY KEY,
    auditdb(#  dname           VARCHAR2(14) CONSTRAINT dept_dname_uq UNIQUE,
    auditdb(#  loc             VARCHAR2(13)
    auditdb(# );
    CREATE TABLE
    auditdb=# DROP TABLE department;
    DROP TABLE
    auditdb=# CREATE TABLE dept (
    auditdb(#  deptno          NUMBER(2) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT dept_pk PRIMARY KEY,
    auditdb(#  dname           VARCHAR2(14) CONSTRAINT dept_dname_uq UNIQUE,
    auditdb(#  loc             VARCHAR2(13)
    auditdb(# );
    CREATE TABLE

The resulting audit log file contains the following.

Each audit log entry has been split and displayed across multiple lines, and a blank line has been inserted between the audit log entries for more clarity in the appearance of the results.

The `CREATE` and `ALTER` statements for the `adminuser` role and `auditdb` database are audited. The error for the `ALTER ROLE adminuser` statement is also logged since error is included in the `edb_audit_statement` parameter.

Similarly, the `CREATE` statements for schema `edb` and tables `department` and `dept` are audited.

Note that the `DROP TABLE department` statement is not in the audit log since there is no `edb_audit_statement` setting that would result in the auditing of successfully processed `DROP` statements such as `ddl`, `all`, or `drop`.

**Example 2**

The following is an example where `edb_audit_connect` and `edb_audit_statement` are set with the following non-default values:

    logging_collector = 'on'
    edb_audit_connect = 'all'
    edb_audit_statement = create view,create materialized view,create
    sequence,grant'

Thus, only SQL statements invoked by the `CREATE VIEW`, `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW`, `CREATE SEQUENCE` and `GRANT` commands are audited.

The database session that occurs is the following:

    $ psql auditdb adminuser
    Password for user adminuser:
    psql.bin (13.0.0)
    Type "help" for help.

    auditdb=# SHOW edb_audit_connect;

The `CREATE VIEW` and `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` statements are audited. Note that the prior `CREATE TABLE emp` statement is not audited since none of the values `create`, `create table`, `ddl`, nor `all` are included in the `edb_audit_statement` parameter.

The `CREATE SEQUENCE` and `GRANT` statements are audited since those values are included in the `edb_audit_statement` parameter.

## Data Manipulation Language Statements

This section describes the values that can be included in the `edb_audit_statement` parameter to audit DML statements.

The following general rules apply:

-   If the `edb_audit_statement` parameter includes either `dml` or `all`, then all DML statements are audited.
-   If the `edb_audit_statement` is set to `none`, then no DML statements are audited.
-   Specific types of DML statements can be chosen for auditing by including a combination of values within the `edb_audit_statement` parameter.

Use the following syntax to specify an `edb_audit_statement` parameter value for `SQL INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `TRUNCATE` statements:

> `{ insert | update | delete | truncate }`

**Example**

The following is an example where `edb_audit_connect` and `edb_audit_statement` are set with the following non-default values:

    logging_collector = 'on'
    edb_audit_connect = 'all'
    edb_audit_statement = 'UPDATE, DELETE, error'

Thus, only SQL statements invoked by the `UPDATE` and `DELETE` commands are audited. All errors are also included in the audit log (even errors not related to the `UPDATE` and `DELETE` commands).

The database session that occurs is the following:

    $ psql auditdb adminuser
    Password for user adminuser:

The resulting audit log file contains the following.

Each audit log entry has been split and displayed across multiple lines, and a blank line has been inserted between the audit log entries for more clarity in the appearance of the results.

    "error"

The `UPDATE dept` and `DELETE FROM emp` statements are audited. Note that all of the prior `INSERT` statements are not audited since none of the values `insert`, `dml`, nor `all` are included in the `edb_audit_statement` parameter.

The `SELECT * FROM dept` statement is not audited as well since neither `select` nor `all` is included in the `edb_audit_statement` parameter.

Since `error` is specified in the `edb_audit_statement` parameter, but not the `truncate` value, the error on the `TRUNCATE employee` statement is logged in the audit file, but not the successful `TRUNCATE emp` statement.
