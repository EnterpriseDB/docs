<div id="audit_log_file" class="registered_link"></div>




The audit log file can be generated in either CSV or XML format depending upon the setting of the `edb_audit` configuration parameter.

The information in the audit log is based on the logging performed by PostgreSQL as described in the section “Using CSV-Format Log Output” within Section “Error Reporting and Logging” in the PostgreSQL core documentation, available at:

> <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-logging.html>

The following table lists the fields in the order they appear in the XML audit log format. The table contains the following information:

-   **Field.** Name of the field as shown in the sample table definition in the PostgreSQL documentation as previously referenced.
-   **XML Element/Attribute.** For the XML format, name of the XML element and its attribute (if used), referencing the value. **Note:** `n/a` indicates that there is no XML representation for this field.
-   **Data Type.** Data type of the field as given by the PostgreSQL sample table definition.
-   **Description.** Description of the field. For certain fields, no output is generated in the audit log as those fields are not supported by auditing. Those fields are indicated by “Not supported”.

The fields that do not have any values for logging appear as consecutive commas (,,) in the CSV format.

The following examples are generated in the CSV and XML formats.

The non-default audit settings in the `postgresql.conf` file are as follows:

    logging_collector = 'on'
    edb_audit = 'csv'
    edb_audit_connect = 'all'
    edb_audit_disconnect = 'all'
    edb_audit_statement = 'ddl, dml, select, error'
    edb_audit_tag = 'edbaudit'

The `edb_audit parameter` is changed to `xml` when generating the XML format.

The audited session is the following:

    $ psql edb enterprisedb
    Password for user enterprisedb:
    psql.bin (13.0.0)
    Type "help" for help.

    edb=# CREATE SCHEMA edb;
