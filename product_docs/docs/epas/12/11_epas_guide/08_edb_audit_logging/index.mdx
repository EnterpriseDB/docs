Advanced Server allows database and security administrators, auditors, and operators to track and analyze database activities using the *EDB Audit Logging* functionality. EDB Audit Logging generates audit log files, which contains all of the relevant information. The audit logs can be configured to record information such as:

-   When a role establishes a connection to an Advanced Server database
-   What database objects a role creates, modifies, or deletes when connected to Advanced Server
-   When any failed authentication attempts occur

The parameters specified in the configuration files, `postgresql.conf` or `postgresql.auto.conf`, control the information included in the audit logs.
