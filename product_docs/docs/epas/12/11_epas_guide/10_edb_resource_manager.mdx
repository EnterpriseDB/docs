*EDB Resource Manager* is an Advanced Server feature that provides the capability to control the usage of operating system resources used by Advanced Server processes.

This capability allows you to protect the system from processes that may uncontrollably overuse and monopolize certain system resources.

The following are some key points about using EDB Resource Manager.

-   The basic component of EDB Resource Manager is a resource group. A *resource group* is a named, global group, available to all databases in an Advanced Server instance, on which various resource usage limits can be defined. Advanced Server processes that are assigned as members of a given resource group are then controlled by EDB Resource Manager so that the aggregate resource usage of all processes in the group is kept near the limits defined on the group.
-   Data definition language commands are used to create, alter, and drop resource groups. These commands can only be used by a database user with superuser privileges.
-   The desired, aggregate consumption level of all processes belonging to a resource group is defined by *resource type parameters*. There are different resource type parameters for the different types of system resources currently supported by EDB Resource Manager.
-   Multiple resource groups can be created, each with different settings for its resource type parameters, thus defining different consumption levels for each resource group.
-   EDB Resource Manager throttles processes in a resource group to keep resource consumption near the limits defined by the resource type parameters. If there are multiple resource type parameters with defined settings in a resource group, the actual resource consumption may be significantly lower for certain resource types than their defined resource type parameter settings. This is because EDB Resource Manager throttles processes attempting to keep *all resources with defined resource type settings within their defined limits*.
-   The definition of available resource groups and their resource type settings are stored in a shared global system catalog. Thus, resource groups can be utilized by all databases in a given Advanced Server instance.
-   The `edb_max_resource_groups` configuration parameter sets the maximum number of resource groups that can be active simultaneously with running processes. The default setting is 16 resource groups. Changes to this parameter take effect on database server restart.
-   Use the `SET edb_resource_group TO group_name` command to assign the current process to a specified resource group. Use the `RESET edb_resource_group` command or `SET edb_resource_group` `TO` `DEFAULT` to remove the current process from a resource group.
-   A default resource group can be assigned to a role using the `ALTER ROLE ... SET` command, or to a database by the `ALTER DATABASE ... SET` command. The entire database server instance can be assigned a default resource group by setting the parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file.
-   In order to include resource groups in a backup file of the database server instance, use the `pg_dumpall` backup utility with default settings (That is, do not specify any of the `--globals-only`, `--roles-only`, or `--tablespaces-only` options.)

## Creating and Managing Resource Groups

The data definition language commands described in this section provide for the creation and management of resource groups.

### CREATE RESOURCE GROUP

Use the `CREATE RESOURCE GROUP` command to create a new resource group.

> `CREATE RESOURCE GROUP <group_name>;`

**Description**

The `CREATE RESOURCE GROUP` command creates a resource group with the specified name. Resource limits can then be defined on the group with the `ALTER RESOURCE GROUP` command. The resource group is accessible from all databases in the Advanced Server instance.

To use the `CREATE RESOURCE GROUP` command you must have superuser privileges.

**Parameters**

`group_name`

> The name of the resource group.

**Example**

The following example results in the creation of three resource groups named `resgrp_a`, `resgrp_b`, and `resgrp_c`.

    edb=# CREATE RESOURCE GROUP resgrp_a;
    CREATE RESOURCE GROUP
    edb=# CREATE RESOURCE GROUP resgrp_b;
    CREATE RESOURCE GROUP
    edb=# CREATE RESOURCE GROUP resgrp_c;
    CREATE RESOURCE GROUP

The following query shows the entries for the resource groups in the `edb_resource_group` catalog.

    edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_resource_group;
     rgrpname  | rgrpcpuratelimit | rgrpdirtyratelimit
    -----------+------------------+--------------------
     resgrp_a  |                0 | 0
     resgrp_b  |                0 | 0
     resgrp_c  |                0 | 0
    (3 rows)

### ALTER RESOURCE GROUP

Use the `ALTER RESOURCE GROUP` command to change the attributes of an existing resource group. The command syntax comes in three forms.

The first form renames the resource group:

    ALTER RESOURCE GROUP <group_name> RENAME TO <new_name>;

The second form assigns a resource type to the resource group:

    ALTER RESOURCE GROUP <group_name> SET
      <resource_type> { TO | = } { <value> | DEFAULT };

The third form resets the assignment of a resource type to its default within the group:

    ALTER RESOURCE GROUP <group_name> RESET <resource_type>;

**Description**

The `ALTER RESOURCE GROUP` command changes certain attributes of an existing resource group.

The first form with the `RENAME TO` clause assigns a new name to an existing resource group.

The second form with the `SET resource_type TO` clause either assigns the specified literal value to a resource type, or resets the resource type when `DEFAULT` is specified. Resetting or setting a resource type to `DEFAULT` means that the resource group has no defined limit on that resource type.

The third form with the `RESET resource_type` clause resets the resource type for the group as described previously.

To use the `ALTER RESOURCE GROUP` command, you must have superuser privileges.

**Parameters**

`group_name`

> The name of the resource group to be altered.

`new_name`

> The new name to be assigned to the resource group.

`resource_type`

> The resource type parameter specifying the type of resource to which a usage value is to be set.

`value | DEFAULT`

> When `value` is specified, the literal value to be assigned to `resource_type`. When `DEFAULT` is specified, the assignment of `resource_type` is reset for the resource group.

**Example**

The following are examples of the `ALTER RESOURCE GROUP` command.

    edb=# ALTER RESOURCE GROUP resgrp_a RENAME TO newgrp;
    ALTER RESOURCE GROUP
    edb=# ALTER RESOURCE GROUP resgrp_b SET cpu_rate_limit = .5;
    ALTER RESOURCE GROUP
    edb=# ALTER RESOURCE GROUP resgrp_b SET dirty_rate_limit = 6144;
    ALTER RESOURCE GROUP
    edb=# ALTER RESOURCE GROUP resgrp_c RESET cpu_rate_limit;
    ALTER RESOURCE GROUP

The following query shows the results of the `ALTER RESOURCE GROUP` commands to the entries in the `edb_resource_group` catalog.

    edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_resource_group;
     rgrpname  | rgrpcpuratelimit | rgrpdirtyratelimit
    -----------+------------------+--------------------
     newgrp    | 0                | 0
     resgrp_b  | 0.5              | 6144
     resgrp_c  | 0                | 0
    (3 rows)

### DROP RESOURCE GROUP

Use the `DROP RESOURCE GROUP` command to remove a resource group.

> `DROP RESOURCE GROUP [ IF EXISTS ] <group_name>;`

**Description**

The `DROP RESOURCE GROUP` command removes a resource group with the specified name.

To use the `DROP RESOURCE GROUP` command you must have superuser privileges.

**Parameters**

`group_name`

> The name of the resource group to be removed.

`IF EXISTS`

> Do not throw an error if the resource group does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

**Example**

The following example removes resource group `newgrp`.

    edb=# DROP RESOURCE GROUP newgrp
    DROP RESOURCE GROUP

### Assigning a Process to a Resource Group

Use the `SET edb_resource_group TO group_name` command to assign the current process to a specified resource group as shown by the following.

    edb=# SET edb_resource_group TO resgrp_b;
    SET
    edb=# SHOW edb_resource_group;
     edb_resource_group
    --------------------
     resgrp_b
    (1 row)

The resource type settings of the group immediately take effect on the current process. If the command is used to change the resource group assigned to the current process, the resource type settings of the newly assigned group immediately take effect.

Processes can be included by default in a resource group by assigning a default resource group to roles, databases, or an entire database server instance.

A default resource group can be assigned to a role using the `ALTER ROLE ... SET` command. For more information about the `ALTER ROLE` command, refer to the PostgreSQL core documentation available at:

> <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-alterrole.html>

A default resource group can be assigned to a database by the `ALTER DATABASE ... SET` command. For more information about the `ALTER DATABASE` command, refer to the PostgreSQL core documentation available at:

> <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-alterdatabase.html>

The entire database server instance can be assigned a default resource group by setting the `edb_resource_group` configuration parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file as shown by the following.

    # - EDB Resource Manager -
    #edb_max_resource_groups = 16           # 0-65536 (change requires restart)
    edb_resource_group = 'resgrp_b'

A change to `edb_resource_group` in the `postgresql.conf` file requires a configuration file reload before it takes effect on the database server instance.

### Removing a Process from a Resource Group

Set `edb_resource_group` to `DEFAULT` or use `RESET edb_resource_group` to remove the current process from a resource group as shown by the following.

    edb=# SET edb_resource_group TO DEFAULT;
    SET
    edb=# SHOW edb_resource_group;
     edb_resource_group
    --------------------
    (1 row)

For removing a default resource group from a role, use the `ALTER ROLE ... RESET` form of the `ALTER ROLE` command.

For removing a default resource group from a database, use the `ALTER DATABASE ... RESET` form of the `ALTER DATABASE` command.

For removing a default resource group from the database server instance, set the `edb_resource_group` configuration parameter to an empty string in the `postgresql.conf` file and reload the configuration file.

### Monitoring Processes in Resource Groups

After resource groups have been created, the number of processes actively using these resource groups can be obtained from the view `edb_all_resource_groups`.

The columns in `edb_all_resource_groups` are the following:

-   **group\_name.** Name of the resource group.
-   **active\_processes.** Number of active processes in the resource group.
-   **cpu\_rate\_limit.** The value of the CPU rate limit resource type assigned to the resource group.
-   **per\_process\_cpu\_rate\_limit.** The CPU rate limit applicable to an individual, active process in the resource group.
-   **dirty\_rate\_limit.** The value of the dirty rate limit resource type assigned to the resource group.
-   **per\_process\_dirty\_rate\_limit.** The dirty rate limit applicable to an individual, active process in the resource group.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

Columns `per_process_cpu_rate_limit` and `per_process_dirty_rate_limit` do not show the *actual* resource consumption used by the processes, but indicate how `EDB Resource Manager` sets the resource limit for an individual process based upon the number of active processes in the resource group.

</div>

The following shows `edb_all_resource_groups` when resource group `resgrp_a` contains no active processes, resource group `resgrp_b` contains two active processes, and resource group `resgrp_c` contains one active process.

    edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_all_resource_groups ORDER BY group_name;
    -[ RECORD 1 ]-----------------+------------------
     group_name                   | resgrp_a
     active_processes             | 0
     cpu_rate_limit               | 0.5
     per_process_cpu_rate_limit   |
     dirty_rate_limit             | 12288
     per_process_dirty_rate_limit |
    -[ RECORD 2 ]-----------------+------------------
     group_name                   | resgrp_b
     active_processes             | 2
     cpu_rate_limit               | 0.4
     per_process_cpu_rate_limit   | 0.195694289022895
     dirty_rate_limit             | 6144
     per_process_dirty_rate_limit | 3785.92924684337
    -[ RECORD 3 ]-----------------+------------------
     group_name                   | resgrp_c
     active_processes             | 1
     cpu_rate_limit               | 0.3
     per_process_cpu_rate_limit   | 0.292342129631091
     dirty_rate_limit             | 3072
     per_process_dirty_rate_limit | 3072

The CPU rate limit and dirty rate limit settings that are assigned to these resource groups are as follows.

    edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_resource_group;
     rgrpname  | rgrpcpuratelimit | rgrpdirtyratelimit
    ----------+------------------+--------------------
     resgrp_a  | 0.5              | 12288
     resgrp_b  | 0.4              | 6144
     resgrp_c  | 0.3              | 3072
    (3 rows)

In the `edb_all_resource_groups` view, note that the `per_process_cpu_rate_limit` and `per_process_dirty_rate_limit` values are roughly the corresponding CPU rate limit and dirty rate limit divided by the number of active processes.

## CPU Usage Throttling

CPU usage of a resource group is controlled by setting the `cpu_rate_limit` resource type parameter.

Set the `cpu_rate_limit` parameter to the fraction of CPU time over wall-clock time to which the combined, simultaneous CPU usage of all processes in the group should not exceed. Thus, the value assigned to `cpu_rate_limit` should typically be less than or equal to 1.

The valid range of the `cpu_rate_limit` parameter is `0` to `1.67772e+07`. A setting of 0 means no CPU rate limit has been set for the resource group.

When multiplied by `100`, the `cpu_rate_limit` can also be interpreted as the CPU usage percentage for a resource group.

EDB Resource Manager utilizes *CPU throttling* to keep the aggregate CPU usage of all processes in the group within the limit specified by the `cpu_rate_limit` parameter. A process in the group may be interrupted and put into sleep mode for a short interval of time to maintain the defined limit. When and how such interruptions occur is defined by a proprietary algorithm used by EDB Resource Manager.

### Setting the CPU Rate Limit for a Resource Group

The `ALTER RESOURCE GROUP` command with the `SET cpu_rate_limit` clause is used to set the CPU rate limit for a resource group.

In the following example the CPU usage limit is set to 50% for `resgrp_a`, 40% for `resgrp_b` and 30% for `resgrp_c`. This means that the combined CPU usage of all processes assigned to `resgrp_a` is maintained at approximately 50%. Similarly, for all processes in `resgrp_b`, the combined CPU usage is kept to approximately 40%, etc.

    edb=# ALTER RESOURCE GROUP resgrp_a SET cpu_rate_limit TO .5;
    ALTER RESOURCE GROUP
    edb=# ALTER RESOURCE GROUP resgrp_b SET cpu_rate_limit TO .4;
    ALTER RESOURCE GROUP
    edb=# ALTER RESOURCE GROUP resgrp_c SET cpu_rate_limit TO .3;
    ALTER RESOURCE GROUP

The following query shows the settings of `cpu_rate_limit` in the catalog.

    edb=# SELECT rgrpname, rgrpcpuratelimit FROM edb_resource_group;
     rgrpname | rgrpcpuratelimit
    ----------+------------------
     resgrp_a |              0.5
     resgrp_b |              0.4
     resgrp_c |              0.3
    (3 rows)

Changing the `cpu_rate_limit` of a resource group not only affects new processes that are assigned to the group, but any currently running processes that are members of the group are immediately affected by the change. That is, if the `cpu_rate_limit` is changed from .5 to .3, currently running processes in the group would be throttled downward so that the aggregate group CPU usage would be near 30% instead of 50%.

To illustrate the effect of setting the CPU rate limit for resource groups, the following examples use a CPU-intensive calculation of 20000 factorial (multiplication of 20000 \* 19999 \* 19998, etc.) performed by the query `SELECT 20000!`; run in the `psql` command line utility.

The resource groups with the CPU rate limit settings shown in the previous query are used in these examples.

### Example – Single Process in a Single Group

The following shows that the current process is set to use resource group `resgrp_b`. The factorial calculation is then started.

    edb=# SET edb_resource_group TO resgrp_b;
    SET
    edb=# SHOW edb_resource_group;
     edb_resource_group
    --------------------
     resgrp_b
    (1 row)
    edb=# SELECT 20000!;

In a second session, the Linux `top` command is used to display the CPU usage as shown under the `%CPU` column. The following is a snapshot at an arbitrary point in time as the `top` command output periodically changes.

    $ top
    top - 16:37:03 up  4:15,  7 users,  load average: 0.49, 0.20, 0.38

        .
        .
        .

The `psql` session performing the factorial calculation is shown by the row where `edb-postgres` appears under the `COMMAND` column. The CPU usage of the session shown under the `%CPU` column shows 39.9, which is close to the 40% CPU limit set for resource group `resgrp_b`.

By contrast, if the `psql` session is removed from the resource group and the factorial calculation is performed again, the CPU usage is much higher.

    edb=# SET edb_resource_group TO DEFAULT;
    SET
    edb=# SHOW edb_resource_group;
     edb_resource_group
    --------------------

    (1 row)

    edb=# SELECT 20000!;

Under the `%CPU` column for `edb-postgres`, the CPU usage is now 93.6, which is significantly higher than the 39.9 when the process was part of the resource group.

    $ top
    top - 16:43:03 up 4:21, 7 users, load average: 0.66, 0.33, 0.37

### Example – Multiple Processes in a Single Group

As stated previously, the CPU rate limit applies to the aggregate of all processes in the resource group. This concept is illustrated in the following example.

The factorial calculation is performed simultaneously in two separate `psql` sessions, each of which has been added to resource group `resgrp_b` that has `cpu_rate_limit` set to .4 (CPU usage of 40%).

**Session 1:**

    edb=# SET edb_resource_group TO resgrp_b;
    SET
    edb=# SHOW edb_resource_group;
     edb_resource_group
    --------------------
     resgrp_b
    (1 row)

    edb=# SELECT 20000!;

**Session 2:**

    edb=# SET edb_resource_group TO resgrp_b;
    SET
    edb=# SHOW edb_resource_group;
     edb_resource_group
    --------------------
     resgrp_b
    (1 row)

    edb=# SELECT 20000!;

A third session monitors the CPU usage.

    $ top
    top - 16:53:03 up 4:31, 7 users, load average: 0.31, 0.19, 0.27
    Tasks: 202 total, 1 running, 201 sleeping, 0 stopped, 0 zombie

        .

There are now two processes named `edb-postgres` with `%CPU` values of 19.9 and 19.6, whose sum is close to the 40% CPU usage set for resource group `resgrp_b`.

The following command sequence displays the sum of all `edb-postgres` processes sampled over half second time intervals. This shows how the total CPU usage of the processes in the resource group changes over time as EDB Resource Manager throttles the processes to keep the total resource group CPU usage near 40%.

    $ while [[ 1 -eq 1 ]]; do  top -d0.5 -b -n2 | grep edb-postgres | awk '{ SUM
    += $9} END { print SUM / 2 }'; done
    37.2

        .

### Example – Multiple Processes in Multiple Groups

In this example, two additional `psql` sessions are used along with the previous two sessions. The third and fourth sessions perform the same factorial calculation within resource group `resgrp_c` with a `cpu_rate_limit` of `.3` (30% CPU usage).

**Session 3:**

    edb=# SET edb_resource_group TO resgrp_c;
    SET
    edb=# SHOW edb_resource_group;
     edb_resource_group
    --------------------
     resgrp_c
    (1 row)

    edb=# SELECT 20000!;

**Session 4:**

    edb=# SET edb_resource_group TO resgrp_c;
    SET
    edb=# SHOW edb_resource_group;
     edb_resource_group
    --------------------
     resgrp_c
    (1 row)
    edb=# SELECT 20000!;

The `top` command displays the following output.

    $ top

The two resource groups in use have CPU usage limits of 40% and 30%. The sum of the `%CPU` column for the first two `edb-postgres` processes is 39.5 (approximately 40%, which is the limit for `resgrp_b`) and the sum of the `%CPU` column for the third and fourth `edb-postgres` processes is 31.6 (approximately 30%, which is the limit for `resgrp_c`).

The sum of the CPU usage limits of the two resource groups to which these processes belong is 70%. The following output shows that the sum of the four processes borders around 70%.

By contrast, if three sessions are processing where two sessions remain in `resgrp_b`, but the third session does not belong to any resource group, the `top` command shows the following output.

The second and third `edb-postgres` processes belonging to the resource group where the CPU usage is limited to 40%, have a total CPU usage of 37.8. However, the first `edb-postgres` process has a 58.6% CPU usage as it is not within a resource group, and basically utilizes the remaining, available CPU resources on the system.

Likewise, the following output shows the sum of all three sessions is around 95% since one of the sessions has no set limit on its CPU usage.

## Dirty Buffer Throttling

Writing to shared buffers is controlled by setting the `dirty_rate_limit` resource type parameter.

Set the `dirty_rate_limit` parameter to the number of kilobytes per second for the combined rate at which all the processes in the group should write to or “dirty” the shared buffers. An example setting would be 3072 kilobytes per seconds.

The valid range of the `dirty_rate_limit` parameter is `0` to `1.67772e+07`. A setting of 0 means no dirty rate limit has been set for the resource group.

EDB Resource Manager utilizes *dirty buffer throttling* to keep the aggregate, shared buffer writing rate of all processes in the group near the limit specified by the `dirty_rate_limit` parameter. A process in the group may be interrupted and put into sleep mode for a short interval of time to maintain the defined limit. When and how such interruptions occur is defined by a proprietary algorithm used by EDB Resource Manager.

### Setting the Dirty Rate Limit for a Resource Group

The `ALTER RESOURCE GROUP` command with the `SET dirty_rate_limit` clause is used to set the dirty rate limit for a resource group.

In the following example the dirty rate limit is set to 12288 kilobytes per second for `resgrp_a`, 6144 kilobytes per second for `resgrp_b` and 3072 kilobytes per second for `resgrp_c`. This means that the combined writing rate to the shared buffer of all processes assigned to `resgrp_a` is maintained at approximately 12288 kilobytes per second. Similarly, for all processes in `resgrp_b`, the combined writing rate to the shared buffer is kept to approximately 6144 kilobytes per second, etc.

    edb=# ALTER RESOURCE GROUP resgrp_a SET dirty_rate_limit TO 12288;
    ALTER RESOURCE GROUP
    edb=# ALTER RESOURCE GROUP resgrp_b SET dirty_rate_limit TO 6144;
    ALTER RESOURCE GROUP
    edb=# ALTER RESOURCE GROUP resgrp_c SET dirty_rate_limit TO 3072;
    ALTER RESOURCE GROUP

The following query shows the settings of `dirty_rate_limit` in the catalog.

    edb=# SELECT rgrpname, rgrpdirtyratelimit FROM edb_resource_group;
     rgrpname  | rgrpdirtyratelimit
    -----------+--------------------
     resgrp_a  |         12288
     resgrp_b  |         6144
     resgrp_c  |         3072
    (3 rows)

Changing the `dirty_rate_limit` of a resource group not only affects new processes that are assigned to the group, but any currently running processes that are members of the group are immediately affected by the change. That is, if the `dirty_rate_limit` is changed from 12288 to 3072, currently running processes in the group would be throttled downward so that the aggregate group dirty rate would be near 3072 kilobytes per second instead of 12288 kilobytes per second.

To illustrate the effect of setting the dirty rate limit for resource groups, the following examples use the following table for intensive I/O operations.

    CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INTEGER, c2 CHARACTER(500)) WITH (FILLFACTOR = 10);

The `FILLFACTOR = 10` clause results in `INSERT` commands packing rows up to only 10% per page. This results in a larger sampling of dirty shared blocks for the purpose of these examples.

The `pg_stat_statements` module is used to display the number of shared buffer blocks that are dirtied by a SQL command and the amount of time the command took to execute. This provides the information to calculate the actual kilobytes per second writing rate for the SQL command, and thus compare it to the dirty rate limit set for a resource group.

In order to use the `pg_stat_statements` module, perform the following steps.

**Step 1:** In the `postgresql.conf` file, add `$libdir/pg_stat_statements` to the `shared_preload_libraries` configuration parameter as shown by the following.

    shared_preload_libraries = '$libdir/dbms_pipe,$libdir/edb_gen,$libdir/
    pg_stat_statements'

**Step 2:** Restart the database server.

**Step 3:** Use the `CREATE EXTENSION` command to complete the creation of the `pg_stat_statements` module.

    edb=# CREATE EXTENSION pg_stat_statements SCHEMA public;
    CREATE EXTENSION

The `pg_stat_statements_reset()` function is used to clear out the `pg_stat_statements` view for clarity of each example.

The resource groups with the dirty rate limit settings shown in the previous query are used in these examples.

<div id="example-single-process-in-a-single-group-1" class="registered_link"></div>

### Example – Single Process in a Single Group

The following sequence of commands shows the creation of table `t1`. The current process is set to use resource group `resgrp_b`. The `pg_stat_statements` view is cleared out by running the `pg_stat_statements_reset()` function.

Finally, the `INSERT` command generates a series of integers from 1 to 10,000 to populate the table, and dirty approximately 10,000 blocks.

    edb=# CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INTEGER, c2 CHARACTER(500)) WITH (FILLFACTOR = 10);
    CREATE TABLE
    edb=# SET edb_resource_group TO resgrp_b;
    SET
    edb=# SHOW edb_resource_group;
     edb_resource_group
    --------------------
     resgrp_b
    (1 row)

    edb=# SELECT pg_stat_statements_reset();
     pg_stat_statements_reset
    --------------------------

    (1 row)

    edb=# INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (generate_series (1,10000), 'aaa');
    INSERT 0 10000

The following shows the results from the `INSERT` command.

    edb=# SELECT query, rows, total_time, shared_blks_dirtied FROM
    pg_stat_statements;
    -[ RECORD 1 ]--------+--------------------------------------------------
     query               | INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (generate_series (?,?), ?);
     rows                | 10000
     total_time          | 13496.184
     shared_blks_dirtied | 10003

The actual dirty rate is calculated as follows.

-   The number of blocks dirtied per millisecond (ms) is 10003 blocks / 13496.184 ms, which yields *0.74117247 blocks per millisecond*.
-   Multiply the result by 1000 to give the number of shared blocks dirtied per second (1 second = 1000 ms), which yields *741.17247 blocks per second*.
-   Multiply the result by 8.192 to give the number of kilobytes dirtied per second (1 block = 8.192 kilobytes), which yields approximately *6072 kilobytes per second*.

Note that the actual dirty rate of 6072 kilobytes per second is close to the dirty rate limit for the resource group, which is 6144 kilobytes per second.

By contrast, if the steps are repeated again without the process belonging to any resource group, the dirty buffer rate is much higher.

    edb=# CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INTEGER, c2 CHARACTER(500)) WITH (FILLFACTOR = 10);
    CREATE TABLE
    edb=# SHOW edb_resource_group;
     edb_resource_group
    --------------------

    (1 row)

    edb=# SELECT pg_stat_statements_reset();
     pg_stat_statements_reset
    --------------------------

    (1 row)

    edb=# INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (generate_series (1,10000), 'aaa');
    INSERT 0 10000

The following shows the results from the `INSERT` command without the usage of a resource group.

    edb=# SELECT query, rows, total_time, shared_blks_dirtied FROM
    pg_stat_statements;
    -[ RECORD 1 ]--------+--------------------------------------------------
     query               | INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (generate_series (?,?), ?);
     rows                | 10000
     total_time          | 2432.165
     shared_blks_dirtied | 10003

First, note the total time was only 2432.165 milliseconds as compared to 13496.184 milliseconds when a resource group with a dirty rate limit set to 6144 kilobytes per second was used.

The actual dirty rate without the use of a resource group is calculated as follows.

-   The number of blocks dirtied per millisecond (ms) is 10003 blocks / 2432.165 ms, which yields *4.112797 blocks per millisecond*.
-   Multiply the result by 1000 to give the number of shared blocks dirtied per second (1 second = 1000 ms), which yields *4112.797 blocks per second*.
-   Multiply the result by 8.192 to give the number of kilobytes dirtied per second (1 block = 8.192 kilobytes), which yields approximately *33692 kilobytes per second*.

Note that the actual dirty rate of 33692 kilobytes per second is significantly higher than when the resource group with a dirty rate limit of 6144 kilobytes per second was used.

<div id="example-multiple-processes-in-a-single-group-1" class="registered_link"></div>

### Example – Multiple Processes in a Single Group

As stated previously, the dirty rate limit applies to the aggregate of all processes in the resource group. This concept is illustrated in the following example.

For this example the inserts are performed simultaneously on two different tables in two separate `psql` sessions, each of which has been added to resource group `resgrp_b` that has a `dirty_rate_limit` set to 6144 kilobytes per second.

**Session 1:**

    edb=# CREATE TABLE t1 (c1 INTEGER, c2 CHARACTER(500)) WITH (FILLFACTOR = 10);
    CREATE TABLE
    edb=# SET edb_resource_group TO resgrp_b;
    SET
    edb=# SHOW edb_resource_group;
     edb_resource_group
    --------------------
     resgrp_b
    (1 row)

    edb=# INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (generate_series (1,10000), 'aaa');
    INSERT 0 10000

**Session 2:**

    edb=# CREATE TABLE t2 (c1 INTEGER, c2 CHARACTER(500)) WITH (FILLFACTOR = 10);
    CREATE TABLE
    edb=# SET edb_resource_group TO resgrp_b;
    SET
    edb=# SHOW edb_resource_group;
     edb_resource_group
    --------------------
     resgrp_b
    (1 row)

    edb=# SELECT pg_stat_statements_reset();
     pg_stat_statements_reset
    --------------------------
    (1 row)

    edb=# INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (generate_series (1,10000), 'aaa');
    INSERT 0 10000

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

The `INSERT` commands in session 1 and session 2 were started after the `SELECT pg_stat_statements_reset()` command in session 2 was run.

</div>

The following shows the results from the `INSERT` commands in the two sessions. `RECORD 3` shows the results from session 1. `RECORD 2` shows the results from session 2.

    edb=# SELECT query, rows, total_time, shared_blks_dirtied FROM
    pg_stat_statements;
    -[ RECORD 1 ]--------+--------------------------------------------------
     query               | SELECT pg_stat_statements_reset();
     rows                | 1
     total_time          | 0.43
     shared_blks_dirtied | 0
    -[ RECORD 2 ]--------+--------------------------------------------------
     query               | INSERT INTO t2 VALUES (generate_series (?,?), ?);
     rows                | 10000
     total_time          | 30591.551
     shared_blks_dirtied | 10003
    -[ RECORD 3 ]--------+--------------------------------------------------
     query               | INSERT INTO t1 VALUES (generate_series (?,?), ?);
     rows                | 10000
     total_time          | 33215.334
     shared_blks_dirtied | 10003

First, note the total time was 33215.334 milliseconds for session 1 and 30591.551 milliseconds for session 2. When only one session was active in the same resource group as shown in the first example, the time was 13496.184 milliseconds. Thus more active processes in the resource group result in a slower dirty rate for each active process in the group. This is shown in the following calculations.

The actual dirty rate for session 1 is calculated as follows.

-   The number of blocks dirtied per millisecond (ms) is 10003 blocks / 33215.334 ms, which yields *0.30115609 blocks per millisecond*.
-   Multiply the result by 1000 to give the number of shared blocks dirtied per second (1 second = 1000 ms), which yields *301.15609 blocks per second*.
-   Multiply the result by 8.192 to give the number of kilobytes dirtied per second (1 block = 8.192 kilobytes), which yields approximately *2467 kilobytes per second*.

The actual dirty rate for session 2 is calculated as follows.

-   The number of blocks dirtied per millisecond (ms) is 10003 blocks / 30591.551 ms, which yields *0.32698571 blocks per millisecond*.
-   Multiply the result by 1000 to give the number of shared blocks dirtied per second (1 second = 1000 ms), which yields *326.98571 blocks per second*.
-   Multiply the result by 8.192 to give the number of kilobytes dirtied per second (1 block = 8.192 kilobytes), which yields approximately *2679 kilobytes per second*.

The combined dirty rate from session 1 (2467 kilobytes per second) and from session 2 (2679 kilobytes per second) yields 5146 kilobytes per second, which is below the set dirty rate limit of the resource group (6144 kilobytes per seconds).

<div id="example-multiple-processes-in-multiple-groups-1" class="registered_link"></div>

### Example – Multiple Processes in Multiple Groups

In this example, two additional `psql` sessions are used along with the previous two sessions. The third and fourth sessions perform the same `INSERT` command in resource group `resgrp_c` with a `dirty_rate_limit` of 3072 kilobytes per second.

Sessions 1 and 2 are repeated as illustrated in the prior example using resource group `resgrp_b` with a `dirty_rate_limit` of 6144 kilobytes per second.

**Session 3:**

    edb=# CREATE TABLE t3 (c1 INTEGER, c2 CHARACTER(500)) WITH (FILLFACTOR = 10);
    CREATE TABLE
    edb=# SET edb_resource_group TO resgrp_c;
    SET
    edb=# SHOW edb_resource_group;
     edb_resource_group
    --------------------


    resgrp_c
    (1 row)

    edb=# INSERT INTO t3 VALUES (generate_series (1,10000), 'aaa');
    INSERT 0 10000

**Session 4:**

    edb=# CREATE TABLE t4 (c1 INTEGER, c2 CHARACTER(500)) WITH (FILLFACTOR =
    10);
    CREATE TABLE
    edb=# SET edb_resource_group TO resgrp_c;
    SET
    edb=# SHOW edb_resource_group;
     edb_resource_group
    --------------------
     resgrp_c
    (1 row)

    edb=# SELECT pg_stat_statements_reset();
     pg_stat_statements_reset
    --------------------------

    (1 row)

    edb=# INSERT INTO t4 VALUES (generate_series (1,10000), 'aaa');
    INSERT 0 10000

     total_time          | 56063.697
     shared_blks_dirtied | 10003

First note that the times of session 1 (28407.435) and session 2 (31343.458) are close to each other as they are both in the same resource group with `dirty_rate_limit` set to 6144, as compared to the times of session 3 (52727.846) and session 4 (56063.697), which are in the resource group with `dirty_rate_limit` set to 3072. The latter group has a slower dirty rate limit so the expected processing time is longer as is the case for sessions 3 and 4.

The actual dirty rate for session 1 is calculated as follows.

-   The number of blocks dirtied per millisecond (ms) is 10003 blocks / 28407.435 ms, which yields *0.35212612 blocks per millisecond*.
-   Multiply the result by 1000 to give the number of shared blocks dirtied per second (1 second = 1000 ms), which yields *352.12612 blocks per second*.
-   Multiply the result by 8.192 to give the number of kilobytes dirtied per second (1 block = 8.192 kilobytes), which yields approximately *2885 kilobytes per second*.

The actual dirty rate for session 2 is calculated as follows.

-   The number of blocks dirtied per millisecond (ms) is 10003 blocks / 31343.458 ms, which yields *0.31914156 blocks per millisecond*.
-   Multiply the result by 1000 to give the number of shared blocks dirtied per second (1 second = 1000 ms), which yields *319.14156 blocks per second*.
-   Multiply the result by 8.192 to give the number of kilobytes dirtied per second (1 block = 8.192 kilobytes), which yields approximately *2614 kilobytes per second*.

The combined dirty rate from session 1 (2885 kilobytes per second) and from session 2 (2614 kilobytes per second) yields 5499 kilobytes per second, which is near the set dirty rate limit of the resource group (6144 kilobytes per seconds).

The actual dirty rate for session 3 is calculated as follows.

-   The number of blocks dirtied per millisecond (ms) is 10003 blocks / 52727.846 ms, which yields *0.18971001 blocks per millisecond*.
-   Multiply the result by 1000 to give the number of shared blocks dirtied per second (1 second = 1000 ms), which yields *189.71001 blocks per second*.
-   Multiply the result by 8.192 to give the number of kilobytes dirtied per second (1 block = 8.192 kilobytes), which yields approximately *1554 kilobytes per second*.

The actual dirty rate for session 4 is calculated as follows.

-   The number of blocks dirtied per millisecond (ms) is 10003 blocks / 56063.697 ms, which yields *0.17842205 blocks per millisecond*.
-   Multiply the result by 1000 to give the number of shared blocks dirtied per second (1 second = 1000 ms), which yields *178.42205 blocks per second*.
-   Multiply the result by 8.192 to give the number of kilobytes dirtied per second (1 block = 8.192 kilobytes), which yields approximately *1462 kilobytes per second*.

The combined dirty rate from session 3 (1554 kilobytes per second) and from session 4 (1462 kilobytes per second) yields 3016 kilobytes per second, which is near the set dirty rate limit of the resource group (3072 kilobytes per seconds).

Thus, this demonstrates how EDB Resource Manager keeps the aggregate dirty rate of the active processes in its groups close to the dirty rate limit set for each group.
