title: "Using Command Tags to Filter Audit Logs"

<div id="using_command_tags_to_filter_audit_logs" class="registered_link"></div>




Each entry in the log file except for those displaying an error message contains a *command tag*. A command tag is the SQL command executed for that particular log entry. The command tag makes it possible to use subsequent tools to scan the log file to find entries related to a particular SQL command.

The following is an example in XML form. The example has been formatted for easier review. The command tag is displayed as the `command_tag` attribute of the event element with values `CREATE ROLE`, `ALTER ROLE`, and `DROP ROLE` in the example.

    <event user="enterprisedb" database="edb" process_id="64234" remote_host="[local]"
           session_id="5ecbc7e6.faea" session_line_num="2" process_status="idle" session_

           virtual_transaction_id="4/30" type="create" command_tag="CREATE ROLE"
           application_name="psql" backend_type="client backend">
               <error_severity>AUDIT</error_severity>
               <message>statement: CREATE ROLE newuser WITH LOGIN;</message>
    </event>
    <event user="enterprisedb" database="edb" process_id="64234" remote_host="[local]"
           session_id="5ecbc7e6.faea" session_line_num="3" process_status="idle" session_
           start_time="2020-05-25 18:58:06 IST" log_time="2020-05-25 18:58:34.142 IST"
           virtual_transaction_id="4/31" type="error" sql_state_code="42601" application_
           name="psql" backend_type="client backend">
               <error_severity>ERROR</error_severity>
               <message>unrecognized role option &quot;super&quot;</message>
               <query>ALTER ROLE newuser WITH SUPER USER;</query>
               <query_pos>25</query_pos>
    </event>
    <event user="enterprisedb" database="edb" process_id="64234" remote_host="[local]"
           session_id="5ecbc7e6.faea" session_line_num="4" process_status="idle" session_
           start_time="2020-05-25 18:58:06 IST" log_time="2020-05-25 18:58:44.680 IST"
           virtual_transaction_id="4/32" type="alter" command_tag="ALTER ROLE"
           application_name="psql" backend_type="client backend">
               <error_severity>AUDIT</error_severity>
               <message>statement: ALTER ROLE newuser WITH SUPERUSER;</message>
    </event>
    <event user="enterprisedb" database="edb" process_id="64234" remote_host="[local]"
           session_id="5ecbc7e6.faea" session_line_num="5" process_status="idle" session_
           start_time="2020-05-25 18:58:06 IST" log_time="2020-05-25 18:58:58.173 IST"
           virtual_transaction_id="4/33" type="drop" command_tag="DROP ROLE" application_
           name="psql" backend_type="client backend">
               <error_severity>AUDIT</error_severity>
               <message>statement: DROP ROLE newuser;</message>
    </event>

The following is the same example in CSV form. The command tag is the next to last column of each entry. In the listing, the column that appears empty (""), would be the value of the `edb_audit_tag` parameter if provided.

Each audit log entry has been split and displayed across multiple lines, and a blank line has been inserted between the audit log entries for more clarity in the appearance of the results.
