<div id="reviewing_the_index_advisor_recommendations" class="registered_link"></div>




There are several ways to review the index recommendations generated by Index Advisor. You can:

-   Query the `index_advisor_log` table.
-   Run the `show_index_recommendations` function.
-   Query the `index_recommendations` view.

## Using the show\_index\_recommendations() Function

To review the recommendations of the Index Advisor utility using the `show_index_recommendations()` function, call the function, specifying the process ID of the session:

> `SELECT show_index_recommendations( pid );`

Where `pid` is the process ID of the current session. If you do not know the process ID of your current session, passing a value of `NULL` will also return a result set for the current session.

The following code fragment shows an example of a row in a result set:

    edb=# SELECT show_index_recommendations(null);
                          show_index_recommendations
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    create index idx_t_a on t(a);/* size: 2184 KB, benefit: 3040.62,
    gain: 1.39222666981456 */
    (1 row)

In the example, `create index idx_t_a on t(a)` is the SQL statement needed to create the index suggested by Index Advisor. Each row in the result set shows:

-   The command required to create the recommended index.
-   The maximum estimated size of the index.
-   The calculated benefit of using the index.
-   The estimated gain that will result from implementing the index.

You can display the results of all Index Advisor sessions from the following view:

> `SELECT * FROM index_recommendations;`

## Querying the index\_advisor\_log Table

Index Advisor stores indexing recommendations in a table named `index_advisor_log`. Each row in the `index_advisor_log` table contains the result of a query where Index Advisor determines it can recommend a hypothetical index to reduce the execution cost of that query.

| Column       | Type        | Description                                              |
|--------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| reloid       | oid         | OID of the base table for the index                      |
| relname      | name        | Name of the base table for the index                     |
| attrs        | integer\[\] | Recommended index columns (identified by column number)  |
| benefit      | real        | Calculated benefit of the index for this query           |
| index\_size  | integer     | Estimated index size in disk-pages                       |
| backend\_pid | integer     | Process ID of the process generating this recommendation |
| timestamp    | timestamp   | Date/Time when the recommendation was generated          |

You can query the `index_advisor_log` table at the psql command line. The following example shows the `index_advisor_log` table entries resulting from two Index Advisor sessions. Each session contains two queries, and can be identified (in the table below) by a different `backend_pid` value. For each session, Index Advisor generated two index recommendations.

    edb=# SELECT * FROM index_advisor_log;
    reloid  | relname | attrs | benefit | index_size | backend_pid | timestamp
    --------+---------+-------+---------+------------+-------------+------------
    ----------------------
    16651   |    t    |  {1}  | 1684.72 |    2184    |     3442    | 22-MAR-11
    16:44:32.712638 -04:00
    16651   |    t    |  {2}  | 1655.52 |    2184    |     3442    | 22-MAR-11
    16:44:32.759436 -04:00
    16651   |    t    |  {1}  | 1355.9  |    2184    |     3506    | 22-MAR-11
    16:48:28.317016 -04:00
    16651   |    t    |  {1}  | 1684.72 |    2184    |     3506    | 22-MAR-11
    16:51:45.927906 -04:00
    (4 rows)

Index Advisor added the first two rows to the table after analyzing the following two queries executed by the `pg_advise_index` utility:

    SELECT * FROM t WHERE a = 500;
    SELECT * FROM t WHERE b < 1000;

The value of `3442` in column `backend_pid` identifies these results as coming from the session with process ID `3442`.

The value of `1` in column `attrs` in the first row indicates that the hypothetical index is on the first column of the table (column `a` of table `t`).

The value of `2` in column `attrs` in the second row indicates that the hypothetical index is on the second column of the table (column `b` of table `t`).

Index Advisor added the last two rows to the table after analyzing the following two queries (executed at the psql command line):

    edb=# EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM t WHERE a < 10000;
                                        QUERY PLAN
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ----------------
    Seq Scan on t (cost=0.00..1693.00 rows=10105 width=8)
      Filter: (a < 10000)
    Result (cost=0.00..337.10 rows=10105 width=8)
      One-Time Filter: '===[ HYPOTHETICAL PLAN ]==='::text
      -> Index Scan using "<hypothetical-index>:1" on t (cost=0.00..337.10
    rows=10105 width=8)
                Index Cond: (a < 10000)
    (6 rows)

    edb=# EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM t WHERE a = 100;
                                        QUERY PLAN
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ----------
    Seq Scan on t (cost=0.00..1693.00 rows=1 width=8)
      Filter: (a = 100)
    Result (cost=0.00..8.28 rows=1 width=8)
      One-Time Filter: '===[ HYPOTHETICAL PLAN ]==='::text
      -> Index Scan using "<hypothetical-index>:3" on t (cost=0.00..8.28
    rows=1 width=8)
                Index Cond: (a = 100)
    (6 rows)

The values in the `benefit` column of the `index_advisor_log` table are calculated using the following formula:

> `benefit = (normal execution cost) - (execution cost with hypothetical index)`

The value of the `benefit` column for the last row of the `index_advisor_log` table (shown in the example) is calculated using the query plan for the following SQL statement:

> `EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM t WHERE a = 100;`

The execution costs of the different execution plans are evaluated and compared:

> `benefit = (Seq Scan on t cost) - (Index Scan using <hypothetical-index>)`

and the benefit is added to the table:

> `benefit = 1693.00 - 8.28`
>
> `benefit = 1684.72`

You can delete rows from the `index_advisor_log` table when you no longer have the need to review the results of the queries stored in the row.

## Querying the index\_recommendations View

The `index_recommendations` view contains the calculated metrics and the `CREATE INDEX` statements to create the recommended indexes for all sessions whose results are currently in the `index_advisor_log` table. You can display the results of all stored Index Advisor sessions by querying the `index_recommendations` view as shown below:

> `SELECT * FROM index_recommendations;`

Using the example shown in the previous section (`Querying the index_advisor_log Table`), the `index_recommendations` view displays the following:

    edb=# SELECT * FROM index_recommendations;
     backend_pid |                                 show_index_recommendations
    -------------+---------------------------------------------------------------
    ------------------------------
         3442    | create index idx_t_a on t(a);/* size: 2184 KB, benefit:
    1684.72, gain: 0.771392654586624 */
         3442    | create index idx_t_b on t(b);/* size: 2184 KB, benefit:
    1655.52, gain: 0.758021539820856 */
         3506    | create index idx_t_a on t(a);/* size: 2184 KB, benefit:
    3040.62, gain: 1.39222666981456 */
    (3 rows)

Within each session, the results of all queries that benefit from the same recommended index are combined to produce one set of metrics per recommended index, reflected in the fields named `benefit` and `gain`.

The formulas for the fields are as follows:

    size = MAX(index size of all queries)
    benefit = SUM(benefit of each query)
    gain = SUM(benefit of each query) / MAX(index size of all queries)

So for example, using the following query results from the process with a `backend_pid` of `3506`:

    reloid  | relname | attrs | benefit | index_size | backend_pid | timestamp
    --------+---------+-------+---------+------------+-------------+------------
    ----------------------
    16651   |    t    |  {1}  |  1355.9 |    2184    |    3506     | 22-MAR-11
    16:48:28.317016 -04:00
    16651   |    t    |  {1}  |  1684.72 |   2184    |    3506     | 22-MAR-11
    16:51:45.927906 -04:00

The metrics displayed from the `index_recommendations` view for `backend_pid 3506` are:

    backend_pid  |                                 show_index_recommendations
    -------------+---------------------------------------------------------------
    ------------------------------
        3506     | create index idx_t_a on t(a);/* size: 2184 KB, benefit:
    3040.62, gain: 1.39222666981456 */

The metrics from the view are calculated as follows:

    benefit = (benefit from 1st query) + (benefit from 2nd query)
    benefit = 1355.9 + 1684.72
    benefit = 3040.62

and

    gain = ((benefit from 1st query) + (benefit from 2nd query)) / MAX(index
    size of all queries)
    gain = (1355.9 + 1684.72) / MAX(2184, 2184)
    gain = 3040.62 / 2184
    gain = 1.39223

The gain metric is useful when comparing the relative advantage of the different recommended indexes derived during a given session. The larger the gain value, the better the cost effectiveness derived from the index weighed against the possible disk space consumption of the index.
