Maximum time between automatic WAL checkpoints, in seconds. The default is five minutes (`5min`). Increasing this parameter can increase the amount of time needed for crash recovery.

Increasing `checkpoint_timeout` to a larger value, such as 15 minutes, can reduce the I/O load on your system, especially when using large values for `shared_buffers`.

The downside of making the aforementioned adjustments to the checkpoint parameters is that your system will use a modest amount of additional disk space, and will take longer to recover in the event of a crash. However, for most users, this is a small price to pay for a significant performance improvement.
