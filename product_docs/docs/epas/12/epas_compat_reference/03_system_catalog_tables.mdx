<div id="system_catalog_tables" class="registered_link"></div>

The following system catalog tables contain definitions of database objects. The layout of the system tables is subject to change; if you are writing an application that depends on information stored in the system tables, it would be prudent to use an existing catalog view, or create a catalog view to isolate the application from changes to the system table.

## dual

`dual` is a single-row, single-column table that is provided for compatibility with Oracle databases only.

| Column  | Type          | Modifiers | Description                      |
| ------- | ------------- | --------- | -------------------------------- |
| `dummy` | `VARCHAR2(1)` |           | Provided for compatibility only. |

## edb_dir

The `edb_dir` table contains one row for each alias that points to a directory created with the `CREATE DIRECTORY` command. A directory is an alias for a pathname that allows a user limited access to the host file system.

You can use a directory to fence a user into a specific directory tree within the file system. For example, the `UTL_FILE` package offers functions that permit a user to read and write files and directories in the host file system, but only allows access to paths that the database administrator has granted access to via a `CREATE DIRECTORY` command.

| Column     | Type        | Modifiers  | Description                                                               |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dirname`  | `"name"`    | `not null` | The name of the alias.                                                    |
| `dirowner` | `oid`       | `not null` | The `OID` of the user that owns the alias.                                |
| `dirpath`  | `text`      |            | The directory name to which access is granted.                            |
| `diracl`   | `aclitem[]` |            | The access control list that determines which users may access the alias. |
