The command line options of the Advanced Server installer offer functionality for Windows systems that reside in situations where a graphical installation may not work because of limited resources or privileges. You can:

-   Include the `--mode unattended` option when invoking the installer to perform an installation without user input.
-   Invoke the installer with the `--extract-only` option to perform a minimal installation when you donâ€™t hold the privileges required to perform a complete installation.

Not all command line options are suitable for all situations. For a complete reference guide to the command line options, see [Reference - Command Line Options](../02_installing_advanced_server_with_the_interactive_installer/02_invoking_the_graphical_installer_from_the_command_line/#reference_command_line_options).

If you are invoking the installer from the command line to perform a system upgrade, the installer will ignore command line options, and preserve the configuration of the previous installation.
