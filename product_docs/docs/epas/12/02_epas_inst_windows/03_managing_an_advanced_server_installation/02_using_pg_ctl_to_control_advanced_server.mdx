You can use the `pg_ctl` utility to control an Advanced Server service from the command line on any platform. `pg_ctl` allows you to start, stop, or restart the Advanced Server database server, reload the configuration parameters, or display the status of a running server. To invoke the utility, assume the identity of the cluster owner, navigate into the home directory of Advanced Server, and issue the command:

> `./bin/pg_ctl -D data_directory action`

`data_directory`

> `data_directory` is the location of the data controlled by the Advanced Server cluster.

`action`

> `action` specifies the action taken by the `pg_ctl` utility. Specify:
>
> > -   `start` to start the service.
> > -   `stop` to stop the service.
> > -   `restart` to stop and then start the service.
> > -   `reload` sends the server a `SIGHUP` signal, reloading configuration parameters
> > -   `status` to discover the current status of the service.
