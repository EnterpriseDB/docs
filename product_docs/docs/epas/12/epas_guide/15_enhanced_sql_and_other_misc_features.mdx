Advanced Server includes enhanced SQL functionality and various other features that provide additional flexibility and convenience. This chapter discusses some of these additions.

## COMMENT

In addition to commenting on objects supported by the PostgreSQL `COMMENT` command, Advanced Server supports comments on additional object types. The complete supported syntax is:

```text
COMMENT ON
{
  AGGREGATE <aggregate_name> ( <aggregate_signature> ) |
  CAST (<source_type> AS <target_type>) |
  COLLATION <object_name> |
  COLUMN <relation_name>.<column_name> |
  CONSTRAINT <constraint_name> ON <table_name> |
  CONSTRAINT <constraint_name> ON DOMAIN <domain_name> |
  CONVERSION <object_name> |
  DATABASE <object_name> |
  DOMAIN <object_name> |
  EXTENSION <object_name> |
  EVENT TRIGGER <object_name> |
  FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER <object_name> |
  FOREIGN TABLE <object_name> |
  FUNCTION <func_name> ([[<argmode>] [<argname>] <argtype> [,...]])|
  INDEX <object_name> |
  LARGE OBJECT <large_object_oid> |
  MATERIALIZED VIEW <object_name> |
  OPERATOR <operator_name> (left_type, right_type) |
  OPERATOR CLASS <object_name> USING <index_method> |
  OPERATOR FAMILY <object_name> USING <index_method> |
  PACKAGE <object_name>
  POLICY <policy_name> ON <table_name> |
  [ PROCEDURAL ] LANGUAGE <object_name> |
  PROCEDURE <proc_name> [([[<argmode>] [<argname>] <argtype> [, ...]])]
  PUBLIC SYNONYM <object_name>
  ROLE <object_name> |
  RULE <rule_name> ON <table_name> |
  SCHEMA <object_name> |
  SEQUENCE <object_name> |
  SERVER <object_name> |
  TABLE <object_name> |
  TABLESPACE <object_name> |
  TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION <object_name> |
  TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY <object_name> |
  TEXT SEARCH PARSER <object_name> |
  TEXT SEARCH TEMPLATE <object_name> |
  TRANSFORM FOR <type_name> LANGUAGE <lang_name> |
  TRIGGER <trigger_name> ON <table_name> |
  TYPE <object_name> |
  VIEW <object_name>
} IS <'text'>
```

where `aggregate_signature` is:

```text
* |
[ <argmode> ] [ <argname> ] <argtype> [ , ... ] |
[ [ <argmode> ] [ <argname> ] <argtype> [ , ... ] ]
ORDER BY [ <argmode> ] [ <argname> ] <argtype> [ , ... ]
```

**Parameters**

`object_name`

The name of the object on which you are commenting.

`AGGREGATE aggregate_name (aggregate_signature)`

Include the `AGGREGATE` clause to create a comment about an aggregate. `aggregate_name` specifies the name of an aggregate, and `aggregate_signature` specifies the associated signature in one of the following forms:

```text
* |
[ <argmode> ] [ <argname> ] <argtype> [ , ... ] |
[ [ <argmode> ] [ <argname> ] <argtype> [ , ... ] ]
ORDER BY [ <argmode> ] [ <argname> ] <argtype> [ , ... ]
```

Where `argmode` is the mode of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument, argmode may be `IN`, `OUT`, `INOUT`, or `VARIADIC`. If omitted, the default is `IN`.

`argname` is the name of an aggregate argument.

`argtype` is the data type of an aggregate argument.

`CAST (source_type AS target_type)`

Include the `CAST` clause to create a comment about a cast. When creating a comment about a cast, `source_type` specifies the source data type of the cast, and `target_type` specifies the target data type of the cast.

`COLUMN relation_name.column_name`

Include the `COLUMN` clause to create a comment about a column. `column_name` specifies name of the column to which the comment applies. `relation_name` is the table, view, composite type, or foreign table in which a column resides.

`CONSTRAINT constraint_name ON table_name`

`CONSTRAINT constraint_name ON DOMAIN domain_name`

Include the `CONSTRAINT` clause to add a comment about a constraint. When creating a comment about a constraint, `constraint_name` specifies the name of the constraint. `table_name` or `domain_name` specifies the name of the table or domain on which the constraint is defined.

`FUNCTION func_name ([[argmode] [argname] argtype [, ...]])`

Include the `FUNCTION` clause to add a comment about a function. `func_name` specifies the name of the function. `argmode` specifies the mode of the function. `argmode` may be `IN`, `OUT`, `INOUT`, or `VARIADIC`. If omitted, the default is `IN`.

`argname` specifies the name of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument. `argtype` specifies the data type of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument.

`large_object_oid`

`large_object_oid` is the system-assigned OID of the large object about which you are commenting.

`OPERATOR operator_name (left_type, right_type)`

Include the `OPERATOR` clause to add a comment about an operator. `operator_name` specifies the (optionally schema-qualified) name of an operator on which you are commenting. `left_type` and `right_type` are the (optionally schema-qualified) data type(s) of the operator's arguments.

`OPERATOR CLASS object_name USING index_method`

Include the `OPERATOR CLASS` clause to add a comment about an operator class. `object_name` specifies the (optionally schema-qualified) name of an operator on which you are commenting. `index_method` specifies the associated index method of the operator class.

`OPERATOR FAMILY object_name USING index_method`

Include the `OPERATOR FAMILY` clause to add a comment about an operator family. `object_name` specifies the (optionally schema-qualified) name of an operator family on which you are commenting. `index_method` specifies the associated index method of the operator family.

`POLICY policy_name ON table_name`

Include the `POLICY` clause to add a comment about a policy. `policy_name` specifies the name of the policy, and `table_name` specifies the table that the policy is associated with.

`PROCEDURE proc_name [([[argmode] [argname] argtype [, ...]])]`

Include the `PROCEDURE` clause to add a comment about a procedure. `proc_name` specifies the name of the procedure. `argmode` specifies the mode of the procedure. `argmode` may be `IN`, `OUT`, `INOUT`, or `VARIADIC`. If omitted, the default is `IN`.

`argname` specifies the name of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument. `argtype` specifies the data type of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument.

`RULE rule_name ON table_name`

Include the `RULE` clause to specify a `COMMENT` on a rule. `rule_name` specifies the name of the rule, and `table_name` specifies the name of the table on which the rule is defined.

`TRANSFORM FOR type_name LANGUAGE lang_name`

Include the `TRANSFORM FOR` clause to specify a `COMMENT` on a `TRANSFORM`.

`type_name` specifies the name of the data type of the transform and `lang_name` specifies the name of the language of the transform.

`TRIGGER trigger_name ON table_name`

Include the `TRIGGER` clause to specify a `COMMENT` on a trigger. `trigger_name` specifies the name of the trigger, and `table_name` specifies the name of the table on which the trigger is defined.

`text`

The comment, written as a string literal or `NULL` to drop the comment.

**Notes:**

Names of tables, aggregates, collations, conversions, domains, foreign tables, functions, indexes, operators, operator classes, operator families, packages, procedures, sequences, text search objects, types, and views can be schema-qualified.

**Example:**

The following example adds a comment to a table named `new_emp`:

```text
COMMENT ON TABLE new_emp IS 'This table contains information about new
employees.';
```

For more information about using the `COMMENT` command, see the PostgreSQL core documentation at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/sql-comment.html>

## Output of Function version()

The text string output of the `version()` function displays the name of the product, its version, and the host system on which it has been installed.

For Advanced Server, the `version()` output is in a format similar to the PostgreSQL community version in that the first text word is *PostgreSQL* instead of *EnterpriseDB* as in Advanced Server version 10 and earlier.

The general format of the version() output is the following:

```text
PostgreSQL $PG_VERSION_EXT (EnterpriseDB Advanced Server $PG_VERSION) on $host
```

So for the current Advanced Server the version string appears as follows:

```text
edb@45032=#select version();
version
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------
PostgreSQL 12.0 (EnterpriseDB Advanced Server 12.0.0) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc 
(GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-11), 64-bit
(1 row)
```

In contrast, for Advanced Server 10, the version string was the following:

```text
edb=# select version();
                                                version
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------
EnterpriseDB 10.4.9 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (GCC) 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 
4.4.7-18), 64-bit
(1 row)
```

## Logical Decoding on Standby

Logical decoding on a standby server allows you to create a logical replication slot on a standby server that can respond to API operations such as `get, peek, advance`, etc..

For more information about the `LOGICAL DECODING`, please refer to the PostgreSQL core documentation available at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/logicaldecoding-explanation.html>

For a logical slot on a standby server to work, the `hot_standby_feedback` parameter must be set to `ON` on the standby. The `hot_standby_feedback` parameter prevents `VACCUM` from removing recently-dead rows that are required by an existing logical replication slot on the standby server. If a slot conflict occurs on the standby, the slots will be dropped.

For logical decoding on a standby to work, `wal_level` must be set to `logical` on both the primary and standby server. If `wal_level` is set to a value other than `logical`, then slots are not created. If you set `wal_level` to a value other than `logical` on primary and if there are existing logical slots on standby, such slots are dropped and new slots cannot be created.

When transactions are written to the primary server, the activity will trigger the creation of a logical slot on the standby server. If a primary server is idle, creating a logical slot on a standby server may take noticeable time.

For more information about functions that support replication and logical decoding example, see to the PostgreSQL documentation available at:
