This section describes the configuration parameters used for planner method configuration.

## edb_enable_pruning

**Parameter Type:** Boolean

**Default Value:** `true`

**Range:** `{true | false}`

**Minimum Scope of Effect:** Per session

**When Value Changes Take Effect:** Immediate

**Required Authorization to Activate:** Session user

When set to `TRUE`, `edb_enable_pruning` allows the query planner to early-prune partitioned tables. `Early-pruning` means that the query planner can `prune` (i.e., ignore) partitions that would not be searched in a query `before` generating query plans. This helps improve performance time as it eliminates the generation of query plans of partitions that would not be searched.

Conversely, `late-pruning` means that the query planner prunes partitions `after` generating query plans for each partition. (The `constraint_exclusion` configuration parameter controls late-pruning.)

The ability to early-prune depends upon the nature of the query in the `WHERE` clause. Early-pruning can be utilized in only simple queries with constraints of the type `WHERE column = literal` (e.g., `WHERE deptno = 10)`.

Early-pruning is not used for more complex queries such as `WHERE column = expression` (e.g., `WHERE deptno = 10 + 5)`.
