The configuration parameters in this section control resource usage pertaining to memory.

## edb_dynatune

**Parameter Type:** Integer

**Default Value:** 0

**Range:** 0 to 100

**Minimum Scope of Effect:** Cluster

**When Value Changes Take Effect:** Restart

**Required Authorization to Activate:** EPAS service account

Determines how much of the host system’s resources are to be used by the database server based upon the host machine’s total available resources and the intended usage of the host machine.

When Advanced Server is initially installed, the `edb_dynatune` parameter is set in accordance with the selected usage of the host machine on which it was installed (i.e., development machine, mixed use machine, or dedicated server). For most purposes, there is no need for the database administrator to adjust the various configuration parameters in the `postgresql.conf` file in order to improve performance.

The `edb_dynatune` parameter can be set to any integer value between 0 and 100, inclusive. A value of 0, turns off the dynamic tuning feature thereby leaving the database server resource usage totally under the control of the other configuration parameters in the `postgresql.conf` file.

A low non-zero, value (e.g., 1 - 33) dedicates the least amount of the host machine’s resources to the database server. This setting would be used for a development machine where many other applications are being used.

A value in the range of 34 - 66 dedicates a moderate amount of resources to the database server. This setting might be used for a dedicated application server that may have a fixed number of other applications running on the same machine as Advanced Server.

The highest values (e.g., 67 - 100) dedicate most of the server’s resources to the database server. This setting would be used for a host machine that is totally dedicated to running Advanced Server.

Once a value of `edb_dynatune` is selected, database server performance can be further fine-tuned by adjusting the other configuration parameters in the `postgresql.conf` file. Any adjusted setting overrides the corresponding value chosen by `edb_dynatune`. You can change the value of a parameter by un-commenting the configuration parameter, specifying the desired value, and restarting the database server.

## edb_dynatune_profile

**Parameter Type:** Enum

**Default Value:** `oltp`

**Range:** `{oltp | reporting | mixed}`

**Minimum Scope of Effect:** Cluster

**When Value Changes Take Effect:** Restart

**Required Authorization to Activate:** EPAS service account

This parameter is used to control tuning aspects based upon the expected workload profile on the database server.

The following are the possible values:

-   `oltp.` Recommended when the database server is processing heavy online transaction processing workloads.
-   `reporting.` Recommended for database servers used for heavy data reporting.
-   `mixed.` Recommended for servers that provide a mix of transaction processing and data reporting.
