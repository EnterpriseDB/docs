<div id="audit_log_file" class="registered_link"></div>

The audit log file can be generated in either CSV or XML format depending upon the setting of the `edb_audit` configuration parameter. The XML format contains less information than the CSV format.

The information in the audit log is based on the logging performed by PostgreSQL as described in the section “Using CSV-Format Log Output” within Section “Error Reporting and Logging” in the PostgreSQL core documentation, available at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/runtime-config-logging.html>

The following table lists the fields in the order they appear in the CSV audit log format. The table contains the following information:

-   **Field.** Name of the field as shown in the sample table definition in the PostgreSQL documentation as previously referenced.
-   **XML Element/Attribute.** For the XML format, name of the XML element and its attribute (if used), referencing the value. **Note:** `n/a` indicates that there is no XML representation for this field.
-   **Data Type.** Data type of the field as given by the PostgreSQL sample table definition.
-   **Description.** Description of the field. For certain fields, no output is generated in the audit log as those fields are not supported by auditing. Those fields are indicated by “Not supported”.

The fields with the `Description` of “Not supported” appear as consecutive commas (,,) in the CSV format.

| Field                    | XML Element/Attribute          | Data Type                  | Description                                                                                                                |

The following examples are generated in the CSV and XML formats.

The non-default audit settings in the `postgresql.conf` file are as follows:

```text
edb_audit = 'csv'
edb_audit_connect = 'all'
edb_audit_disconnect = 'all'
edb_audit_statement = 'ddl, dml, select, error'
edb_audit_tag = 'edbaudit'
```

The `edb_audit parameter` is changed to `xml` when generating the XML format.

The audited session is the following:

```Text
$ psql edb enterprisedb
Password for user enterprisedb:
psql.bin (12.0.0)
Type "help" for help.

edb=# CREATE SCHEMA edb;

edb(#     loc             VARCHAR2(13)

**CSV Audit Log File**

The following is the CSV format of the audit log file.

Each audit log entry has been split and displayed across multiple lines, and a blank line has been inserted between the audit log entries for more clarity in the appearance of the results.
