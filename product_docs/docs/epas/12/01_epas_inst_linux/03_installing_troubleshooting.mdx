**Difficulty Displaying Java-based Applications**

If you encounter difficulty displaying Java-based server features (controls or text not being displayed correctly, or blank windows), upgrading to the latest `libxcb-xlib` libraries should correct the problem on most distributions. Please visit the following link for other possible work-arounds:

**The Installation Fails to Complete Due to Existing data Directory Contents**

If an installation fails to complete due to an existing content in the data directory, the server will write an error message to the server logs:

> `A data directory is neither empty, or a recognisable data directory.`

If you encounter a similar message, you should confirm that the data directory is empty; the presence of files (including the system-generated `lost+found` folder) will prevent the installation from completing. Either remove the files from the data directory, or specify a different location for the data directory before re-invoking the installer to complete the installation.

**Difficulty Installing the EPEL Release Package**

If you encounter difficulty when installing the `EPEL` release package, you can use the following command to install the `epel-release` package:

    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

Please note that you may need to enable the `[extras]` repository definition in the `CentOS-Base.repo` file (located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`). If `yum` cannot access a repository that contains `epel-release`, you will get an error message:

> `No package epel available.` `Error: Nothing to do`

If you receive this error, you can download the `EPEL` rpm package, and install it manually; download the rpm package, assume superuser privileges, navigate into the directory that contains the package, and install `EPEL` with the command:

> `yum install epel-release`
