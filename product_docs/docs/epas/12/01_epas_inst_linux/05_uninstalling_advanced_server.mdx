Note that after uninstalling Advanced Server, the cluster data files remain intact and the service user persists. You may manually remove the cluster `data` and service user from the system.

## Uninstalling an RPM Package

You can use variations of the rpm or yum command to remove installed packages. Note that removing a package does not damage the Advanced Server `data` directory.

Include the `-e` option when invoking the rpm command to remove an installed package; the command syntax is:

> `rpm -e <package_name>`

Where `package_name` is the name of the package that you would like to remove.

You can use the `yum remove` command to remove a package installed by yum. To remove a package, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter the command:

> `yum remove <package_name>`

Where `package_name` is the name of the package that you would like to remove.

yum and RPM will not remove a package that is required by another package. If you attempt to remove a package that satisfies a package dependency, yum or RPM will provide a warning.
