The sections that follow describe ecpgPlus language elements:

-   C-Preprocessor Directives
-   Supported C Data Types
-   Type Codes
-   The SQLDA Structure
-   ECPGPlus Statements

## C-preprocessor Directives

The ECPGPlus C-preprocessor enforces two behaviors that are dependent on the mode in which you invoke ECPGPlus:

-   `PROC` mode
-   non-`PROC` mode

**Compiling in PROC Mode**

In `PROC` mode, ECPGPlus allows you to:

-   Declare host variables outside of an `EXEC SQL BEGIN/END DECLARE SECTION`.
-   Use any C variable as a host variable as long as it is of a data type compatible with ECPG.

When you invoke ECPGPlus in `PROC` mode (by including the `-C PROC` keywords), the ECPG compiler honors the following C-preprocessor directives:

```text
#include
#if expression
#ifdef symbolName
#ifndef symbolName
#else
#elif expression
#endif
#define symbolName expansion
#define symbolName([macro arguments]) expansion
#undef symbolName
#defined(symbolName)
```

Pre-processor directives are used to effect or direct the code that is received by the compiler. For example, using the following code sample:

```text
#if HAVE_LONG_LONG == 1
#define BALANCE_TYPE long long
#else
#define BALANCE_TYPE double
#endif
...
BALANCE_TYPE customerBalance;
```

If you invoke ECPGPlus with the following command-line arguments:

```text
ecpg –C PROC –DHAVE_LONG_LONG=1
```

ECPGPlus will copy the entire fragment (without change) to the output file, but will only send the following tokens to the ECPG parser:

```text
long long customerBalance;
```

On the other hand, if you invoke ECPGPlus with the following command-line arguments:

```text
ecpg –C PROC –DHAVE_LONG_LONG=0
```

The ECPG parser will receive the following tokens:

```text
double customerBalance;
```

If your code uses preprocessor directives to filter the code that is sent to the compiler, the complete code is retained in the original code, while the ECPG parser sees only the processed token stream.

You can also use compatible syntax when executing the following preprocessor directives with an `EXEC` directive:

```text
EXEC ORACLE DEFINE
EXEC ORACLE UNDEF
EXEC ORACLE INCLUDE
EXEC ORACLE IFDEF
EXEC ORACLE IFNDEF
EXEC ORACLE ELIF
EXEC ORACLE ELSE
EXEC ORACLE ENDIF
EXEC ORACLE OPTION
```

For example, if your code includes the following:

```text
EXEC ORACLE IFDEF HAVE_LONG_LONG;
#define BALANCE_TYPE long long
EXEC ORACLE ENDIF;
BALANCE_TYPE customerBalance;
```

If you invoke ECPGPlus with the following command-line arguments:

```text
ecpg –C PROC DEFINE=HAVE_LONG_LONG=1
```

ECPGPlus will send the following tokens to the output file, and the ECPG parser:

```text
long long customerBalance;
```

!!! Note
    The `EXEC ORACLE` pre-processor directives only work if you specify `-C PROC` on the ECPG command line.

**Using the SELECT_ERROR Precompiler Option**

When using ECPGPlus in compatible mode, you can use the `SELECT_ERROR` precompiler option to instruct your program how to handle result sets that contain more rows than the host variable can accommodate. The syntax is:

```text
SELECT_ERROR={YES|NO}
```

The default value is `YES`; a `SELECT` statement will return an error message if the result set exceeds the capacity of the host variable. Specify `NO` to instruct the program to suppress error messages when a `SELECT` statement returns more rows than a host variable can accommodate.

Use `SELECT_ERROR` with the `EXEC ORACLE OPTION` directive.

**Compiling in non-PROC Mode**

If you do not include the `-C PROC` command-line option:

-   C preprocessor directives are copied to the output file without change.
-   You must declare the type and name of each C variable that you intend to use as a host variable within an `EXEC SQL BEGIN/END DECLARE` section.

When invoked in non-`PROC` mode, ECPG implements the behavior described in the PostgreSQL Core documentation.

<div id="supported_c_data_types" class="registered_link"></div>

## Supported C Data Types

An ECPGPlus application must deal with two sets of data types: SQL data types (such as `SMALLINT`, `DOUBLE PRECISION` and `CHARACTER VARYING`) and C data types (like `short`, `double` and `varchar[n]`). When an application fetches data from the server, ECPGPlus will map each SQL data type to the type of the C variable into which the data is returned.

In general, ECPGPlus can convert most SQL server types into similar C types, but not all combinations are valid. For example, ECPGPlus will try to convert a SQL character value into a C integer value, but the conversion may fail (at execution time) if the SQL character value contains non-numeric characters. The reverse is also true; when an application sends a value to the server, ECPGPlus will try to convert the C data type into the required SQL type. Again, the conversion may fail (at execution time) if the C value cannot be converted into the required SQL type.

ECPGPlus can convert any SQL type into C character values `(char[n]` or `varchar[n])`. Although it is safe to convert any SQL type to/from `char[n]` or `varchar[n]`, it is often convenient to use more natural C types such as `int`, `double`, or `float`.

The supported C data types are:

-   `short`
-   `int`
-   `unsigned int`
-   `long long int`
-   `float`
-   `double`
-   `char[n+1]`
-   `varchar[n+1]`
-   `bool`
-   and any equivalent created by a `typedef`

In addition to the numeric and character types supported by C, the `pgtypeslib` run-time library offers custom data types (and functions to operate on those types) for dealing with date/time and exact numeric values:

-   `timestamp`
-   `interval`
-   `date`
-   `decimal`
-   `numeric`

To use a data type supplied by `pgtypeslib`, you must `#include` the proper header file.

## Type Codes

The following table contains the type codes for *external* data types. An external data type is used to indicate the type of a C host variable. When an application binds a value to a parameter or binds a buffer to a `SELECT`-list item, the type code in the corresponding SQLDA descriptor `(descriptor->T[column])` should be set to one of the following values:

| **Type Code**                                     | **Host Variable Type (C Data Type)**      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `1, 2, 8, 11, 12, 15, 23, 24, 91, 94, 95, 96, 97` | `char[]`                                  |
| `3`                                               | `int`                                     |
| `4, 7, 21`                                        | `float`                                   |
| `5, 6`                                            | `null-terminated string (char[length+1])` |
| `9`                                               | `varchar`                                 |
| `22`                                              | `double`                                  |
| `68`                                              | `unsigned int`                            |

The following table contains the type codes for *internal* data types. An internal type code is used to indicate the type of a value as it resides in the database. The `DESCRIBE SELECT LIST` statement populates the data type array `(descriptor->T[column])` using the following values.

| **Internal Type Code** | **Server Type**          |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ |
| `1`                    | `VARCHAR2`               |
| `2`                    | `NUMBER`                 |
| `8`                    | `LONG`                   |
| `11`                   | `ROWID`                  |
| `12`                   | `DATE`                   |
| `23`                   | `RAW`                    |
| `24`                   | `LONG RAW`               |
| `96`                   | `CHAR`                   |
| `100`                  | `BINARY FLOAT`           |
| `101`                  | `BINARY DOUBLE`          |
| `104`                  | `UROWID`                 |
| `187`                  | `TIMESTAMP`              |
| `188`                  | `TIMESTAMP W/TIMEZONE`   |
| `189`                  | `INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH` |
| `190`                  | `INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND` |
| `232`                  | `TIMESTAMP LOCAL_TZ`     |

## The SQLDA Structure

Oracle Dynamic SQL method 4 uses the SQLDA data structure to hold the data and metadata for a dynamic SQL statement. A SQLDA structure can describe a set of input parameters corresponding to the parameter markers found in the text of a dynamic statement or the result set of a dynamic statement. The layout of the SQLDA structure is:

```text
struct SQLDA
{
  int     N; /* Number of entries             */
  char  **V; /* Variables                 */
  int    *L; /* Variable lengths          */
  short  *T; /* Variable types            */
  short **I; /* Indicators                */
  int     F; /* Count of variables discovered by DESCRIBE */
  char  **S; /* Variable names            */
  short  *M; /* Variable name maximum lengths     */
  short  *C; /* Variable name actual lengths  */
  char  **X; /* Indicator names           */
  short  *Y; /* Indicator name maximum lengths */
  short  *Z; /* Indicator name actual lengths     */
};
```

**Parameters**

`N - maximum number of entries`

 The N structure member contains the maximum number of entries that the SQLDA may describe. This member is populated by the `sqlald()` function when you allocate the SQLDA structure. Before using a descriptor in an `OPEN` or `FETCH` statement, you must set `N` to the *actual* number of values described.

`V - data values`

 The `V` structure member is a pointer to an array of data values.

-   For a `SELECT`-list descriptor, `V` points to an array of values returned by a `FETCH` statement (each member in the array corresponds to a column in the result set).
-   For a bind descriptor, `V` points to an array of parameter values (you must populate the values in this array before opening a cursor that uses the descriptor).

Your application must allocate the space required to hold each value. Refer to [displayResultSet ()](05_building_executing_dynamic_sql_statements/#executing_query_with_unknown_number_of_variables) function for an example of how to allocate space for `SELECT`-list values.

`L - length of each data value`

 The `L` structure member is a pointer to an array of lengths. Each member of this array must indicate the amount of memory available in the corresponding member of the `V` array. For example, if `V[5]` points to a buffer large enough to hold a 20-byte NULL-terminated string, `L[5]` should contain the value 21 (20 bytes for the characters in the string plus 1 byte for the NULL-terminator). Your application must set each member of the `L` array.

`T - data types`

 The `T` structure member points to an array of data types, one for each column (or parameter) described by the descriptor.

-   For a bind descriptor, you must set each member of the `T` array to tell ECPGPlus the data type of each parameter.
-   For a `SELECT`-list descriptor, the `DESCRIBE SELECT LIST` statement sets each member of the `T` array to reflect the type of data found in the corresponding column.

You may change any member of the `T` array before executing a `FETCH` statement to force ECPGPlus to convert the corresponding value to a specific data type. For example, if the `DESCRIBE SELECT LIST` statement indicates that a given column is of type `DATE`, you may change the corresponding `T` member to request that the next `FETCH` statement return that value in the form of a NULL-terminated string. Each member of the `T` array is a numeric type code (see [Type Codes](#type-codes) for a list of type codes). The type codes returned by a `DESCRIBE SELECT LIST` statement differ from those expected by a `FETCH` statement. After executing a `DESCRIBE SELECT LIST` statement, each member of `T` encodes a data type *and* a flag indicating whether the corresponding column is nullable. You can use the `sqlnul()` function to extract the type code and nullable flag from a member of the T array. The signature of the `sqlnul()` function is as follows:

```
void sqlnul(unsigned short *valType,
            unsigned short *typeCode,
            int            *isNull)
```

For example, to find the type code and nullable flag for the third column of a descriptor named results, you would invoke `sqlnul()` as follows:

```
sqlnul(&results->T[2], &typeCode, &isNull);
```

`I - indicator variables`

 The `I` structure member points to an array of indicator variables. This array is allocated for you when your application calls the `sqlald()` function to allocate the descriptor.

-   For a `SELECT`-list descriptor, each member of the `I` array indicates whether the corresponding column contains a NULL (non-zero) or non-NULL (zero) value.
-   For a bind parameter, your application must set each member of the `I` array to indicate whether the corresponding parameter value is NULL.

`F - number of entries`

 The `F` structure member indicates how many values are described by the descriptor (the `N` structure member indicates the *maximum* number of values which may be described by the descriptor; `F` indicates the actual number of values). The value of the `F` member is set by ECPGPlus when you execute a `DESCRIBE` statement. `F` may be positive, negative, or zero.

-   For a `SELECT`-list descriptor, `F` will contain a positive value if the number of columns in the result set is equal to or less than the maximum number of values permitted by the descriptor (as determined by the `N` structure member); 0 if the statement is *not* a `SELECT` statement, or a negative value if the query returns more columns than allowed by the `N` structure member.
-   For a bind descriptor, `F` will contain a positive number if the number of parameters found in the statement is less than or equal to the maximum number of values permitted by the descriptor (as determined by the `N` structure member); 0 if the statement contains no parameters markers, or a negative value if the statement contains more parameter markers than allowed by the `N` structure member.

If `F` contains a positive number (after executing a `DESCRIBE` statement), that number reflects the count of columns in the result set (for a `SELECT`-list descriptor) or the number of parameter markers found in the statement (for a bind descriptor). If `F` contains a negative value, you may compute the absolute value of `F` to discover how many values (or parameter markers) are required. For example, if `F` contains `-24` after describing a `SELECT` list, you know that the query returns 24 columns.

`S - column/parameter names`

 The `S` structure member points to an array of NULL-terminated strings.

-   For a `SELECT`-list descriptor, the `DESCRIBE SELECT LIST` statement sets each member of this array to the name of the corresponding column in the result set.
-   For a bind descriptor, the `DESCRIBE BIND VARIABLES` statement sets each member of this array to the name of the corresponding bind variable.

In this release, the name of each bind variable is determined by the left-to-right order of the parameter marker within the query - for example, the name of the first parameter is always `?0`, the name of the second parameter is always `?1`, and so on.

`M - maximum column/parameter name length`

 The `M` structure member points to an array of lengths. Each member in this array specifies the *maximum* length of the corresponding member of the `S` array (that is, `M[0]` specifies the maximum length of the column/parameter name found at `S[0]`). This array is populated by the `sqlald()` function.

`C - actual column/parameter name length`

 The `C` structure member points to an array of lengths. Each member in this array specifies the *actual* length of the corresponding member of the `S` array (that is, `C[0]` specifies the actual length of the column/parameter name found at `S[0]`).

 This array is populated by the `DESCRIBE` statement.

`X - indicator variable names`

 The `X` structure member points to an array of NULL-terminated strings -each string represents the name of a NULL indicator for the corresponding value.

 This array is not used by ECPGPlus, but is provided for compatibility with Pro\*C applications.

`Y - maximum indicator name length`

 The `Y` structure member points to an array of lengths. Each member in this array specifies the *maximum* length of the corresponding member of the `X` array (that is, `Y[0]` specifies the maximum length of the indicator name found at `X[0]`).

 This array is not used by ECPGPlus, but is provided for compatibility with Pro\*C applications.

`Z - actual indicator name length`

 The `Z` structure member points to an array of lengths. Each member in this array specifies the *actual* length of the corresponding member of the `X` array (that is, `Z[0]` specifies the actual length of the indicator name found at `X[0]`).

 This array is not used by ECPGPlus, but is provided for compatibility with Pro\*C applications.

## ECPGPlus Statements

An embedded SQL statement allows your client application to interact with the server, while an embedded directive is an instruction to the ECPGPlus compiler.

You can embed any Advanced Server SQL statement in a C program. Each statement should begin with the keywords `EXEC SQL`, and must be terminated with a semi-colon (;). Within the C program, a SQL statement takes the form:

```text
EXEC SQL <sql_command_body>;
```

Where `sql_command_body` represents a standard SQL statement. You can use a host variable anywhere that the SQL statement expects a value expression. For more information about substituting host variables for value expressions, refer to [Declaring Host Variables](03_using_embedded_sql/#declaring-host-variables).

ECPGPlus extends the PostgreSQL server-side syntax for some statements; for those statements, syntax differences are outlined in the following reference sections. For a complete reference to the supported syntax of other SQL commands, refer to the *PostgreSQL* *Core* *Documentation* available at:

 <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/sql-commands.html>

### ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR

Use the `ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR` statement to allocate an SQL descriptor area:

```text
EXEC SQL [FOR <array_size>] ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>
    [WITH MAX <variable_count>];
```

Where:

`array_size` is a variable that specifies the number of array elements to allocate for the descriptor. `array_size` may be an `INTEGER` value or a host variable.

`descriptor_name` is the host variable that contains the name of the descriptor, or the name of the descriptor. This value may take the form of an identifier, a quoted string literal, or of a host variable.

`variable_count` specifies the maximum number of host variables in the descriptor. The default value of `variable_count` is `100`.

The following code fragment allocates a descriptor named `emp_query` that may be processed as an array `(emp_array)`:

```text
EXEC SQL FOR :emp_array ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR emp_query;
```

### CALL

Use the `CALL` statement to invoke a procedure or function on the server. The `CALL` statement works only on Advanced Server. The `CALL` statement comes in two forms; the first form is used to call a *function*:

```text
EXEC SQL CALL <program_name> '('[<actual_arguments>]')'
  INTO [[:<ret_variable>][: <ret_indicator>]];
```

The second form is used to call a *procedure*:

```text
EXEC SQL CALL <program_name> '('[<actual_arguments>]')';
```

Where:

`program_name` is the name of the stored procedure or function that the `CALL` statement invokes. The program name may be schema-qualified or package-qualified (or both); if you do not specify the schema or package in which the program resides, ECPGPlus will use the value of `search_path` to locate the program.

`actual_arguments` specifies a comma-separated list of arguments required by the program. Note that each `actual_argument` corresponds to a formal argument expected by the program. Each formal argument may be an `IN` parameter, an `OUT` parameter, or an `INOUT` parameter.

`:ret_variable` specifies a host variable that will receive the value returned if the program is a function.

`:ret_indicator` specifies a host variable that will receive the indicator value returned, if the program is a function.

For example, the following statement invokes the `get_job_desc` function with the value contained in the `:ename` host variable, and captures the value returned by that function in the `:job` host variable:

```text
EXEC SQL CALL get_job_desc(:ename)
  INTO :job;
```

### CLOSE

Use the `CLOSE` statement to close a cursor, and free any resources scurrently in use by the cursor. A client application cannot fetch rows from a closed cursor. The syntax of the `CLOSE` statement is:

```text
EXEC SQL CLOSE [<cursor_name>];
```

Where:

`cursor_name` is the name of the cursor closed by the statement. The cursor name may take the form of an identifier or of a host variable.

The `OPEN` statement initializes a cursor. Once initialized, a cursor result set will remain unchanged unless the cursor is re-opened. You do not need to `CLOSE` a cursor before re-opening it.

To manually close a cursor named `emp_cursor`, use the command:

```text
EXEC SQL CLOSE emp_cursor;
```

A cursor is automatically closed when an application terminates.

### COMMIT

Use the `COMMIT` statement to complete the current transaction, making all changes permanent and visible to other users. The syntax is:

```text
EXEC SQL [AT <database_name>] COMMIT [WORK]
         [COMMENT <'text'>] [COMMENT <'text'> RELEASE];
```

Where:

`database_name` is the name of the database (or host variable that contains the name of the database) in which the work resides. This value may take the form of an unquoted string literal, or of a host variable.

For compatibility, ECPGPlus accepts the `COMMENT` clause without error but does *not* store any text included with the `COMMENT` clause.

Include the `RELEASE` clause to close the current connection after performing the commit.

For example, the following command commits all work performed on the `dept` database and closes the current connection:

```text
EXEC SQL AT dept COMMIT RELEASE;
```

By default, statements are committed only when a client application performs a `COMMIT` statement. Include the `-t` option when invoking ECPGPlus to specify that a client application should invoke `AUTOCOMMIT` functionality. You can also control `AUTOCOMMIT` functionality in a client application with the following statements:

```text
EXEC SQL SET AUTOCOMMIT TO ON
```

and

```text
EXEC SQL SET AUTOCOMMIT TO OFF
```

### CONNECT

Use the `CONNECT` statement to establish a connection to a database. The `CONNECT` statement is available in two forms - one form is compatible with Oracle databases, the other is not.

The first form is compatible with Oracle databases:

```text
EXEC SQL CONNECT
  {{:<user_name> IDENTIFIED BY :<password>}  | :<connection_id>}
  [AT <database_name>]
  [USING :database_string]
  [ALTER AUTHORIZATION :new_password];
```

Where:

`user_name` is a host variable that contains the role that the client application will use to connect to the server.

`password` is a host variable that contains the password associated with that role.

`connection_id` is a host variable that contains a slash-delimited user name and password used to connect to the database.

Include the `AT` clause to specify the database to which the connection is established. `database_name` is the name of the database to which the client is connecting; specify the value in the form of a variable, or as a string literal.

Include the `USING` clause to specify a host variable that contains a null-terminated string identifying the database to which the connection will be established.

The `ALTER AUTHORIZATION` clause is supported for syntax compatibility only; ECPGPlus parses the `ALTER AUTHORIZATION` clause, and reports a warning.

Using the first form of the `CONNECT` statement, a client application might establish a connection with a host variable named `user` that contains the identity of the connecting role, and a host variable named `password` that contains the associated password using the following command:

```text
EXEC SQL CONNECT :user IDENTIFIED BY :password;
```

A client application could also use the first form of the `CONNECT` statement to establish a connection using a single host variable named `:connection_id`. In the following example, `connection_id` contains the slash-delimited role name and associated password for the user:

```text
EXEC SQL CONNECT :connection_id;
```

The syntax of the second form of the `CONNECT` statement is:

```text
EXEC SQL CONNECT TO <database_name>
[AS <connection_name>] [<credentials>];
```

Where `credentials` is one of the following:

```text
USER user_name password
USER user_name IDENTIFIED BY password
USER user_name USING password
```

In the second form:

`database_name` is the name or identity of the database to which the client is connecting. Specify `database_name` as a variable, or as a string literal, in one of the following forms:

```text
<database_name>[@<hostname>][:<port>]

tcp:postgresql://<hostname>[:<port>][/<database_name>][options]

unix:postgresql://<hostname>[:<port>][/<database_name>][options]
```

Where:

 `hostname` is the name or IP address of the server on which the database resides.

 `port` is the port on which the server listens.

 You can also specify a value of `DEFAULT` to establish a connection with the default database, using the default role name. If you specify `DEFAULT` as the target database, do not include a `connection_name` or `credentials`.

`connection_name` is the name of the connection to the database. `connection_name` should take the form of an identifier (that is, not a string literal or a variable). You can open multiple connections, by providing a unique `connection_name` for each connection.

 If you do not specify a name for a connection, `ecpglib` assigns a name of `DEFAULT` to the connection. You can refer to the connection by name (`DEFAULT`) in any `EXEC SQL` statement.

 `CURRENT` is the most recently opened or the connection mentioned in the most-recent `SET CONNECTION TO` statement. If you do not refer to a connection by name in an `EXEC SQL` statement, ECPG assumes the name of the connection to be `CURRENT`.

`user_name` is the role used to establish the connection with the Advanced Server database. The privileges of the specified role will be applied to all commands performed through the connection.

`password` is the password associated with the specified `user_name`.

The following code fragment uses the second form of the `CONNECT` statement to establish a connection to a database named `edb`, using the role `alice` and the password associated with that role, `1safepwd`:

```text
EXEC SQL CONNECT TO edb AS acctg_conn
  USER 'alice' IDENTIFIED BY '1safepwd';
```

The name of the connection is `acctg_conn`; you can use the connection name when changing the connection name using the `SET CONNECTION` statement.

### DEALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR

Use the `DEALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR` statement to free memory in use by an allocated descriptor. The syntax of the statement is:

```text
EXEC SQL DEALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>
```

Where:

`descriptor_name` is the name of the descriptor. This value may take the form of a quoted string literal, or of a host variable.

The following example deallocates a descriptor named `emp_query`:

```text
EXEC SQL DEALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR emp_query;
```

### DECLARE CURSOR

Use the `DECLARE CURSOR` statement to define a cursor. The syntax of the statement is:

```text
EXEC SQL [AT <database_name>] DECLARE <cursor_name> CURSOR FOR
(<select_statement> | <statement_name>);
```

Where:

`database_name` is the name of the database on which the cursor operates. This value may take the form of an identifier or of a host variable. If you do not specify a database name, the default value of `database_name` is the default database.

`cursor_name` is the name of the cursor.

`select_statement` is the text of the `SELECT` statement that defines the cursor result set; the `SELECT` statement cannot contain an `INTO` clause.

`statement_name` is the name of a SQL statement or block that defines the cursor result set.

The following example declares a cursor named `employees`:

```text
EXEC SQL DECLARE employees CURSOR FOR
  SELECT
    empno, ename, sal, comm
  FROM
    emp;
```

The cursor generates a result set that contains the employee number, employee name, salary and commission for each employee record that is stored in the `emp` table.

### DECLARE DATABASE

Use the `DECLARE DATABASE` statement to declare a database identifier for use in subsequent SQL statements (for example, in a `CONNECT` statement). The syntax is:

```text
EXEC SQL DECLARE <database_name> DATABASE;
```

Where:

`database_name` specifies the name of the database.

The following example demonstrates declaring an identifier for the `acctg` database:

```text
EXEC SQL DECLARE acctg DATABASE;
```

After invoking the command declaring `acctg` as a database identifier, the `acctg` database can be referenced by name when establishing a connection or in `AT` clauses.

This statement has no effect and is provided for Pro\*C compatibility only.

### DECLARE STATEMENT

Use the `DECLARE STATEMENT` directive to declare an identifier for an SQL statement. Advanced Server supports two versions of the `DECLARE STATEMENT` directive:

```text
EXEC SQL [<database_name>] DECLARE <statement_name> STATEMENT;
```

and

```text
EXEC SQL DECLARE STATEMENT <statement_name>;
```

Where:

`statement_name` specifies the identifier associated with the statement.

`database_name` specifies the name of the database. This value may take the form of an identifier or of a host variable that contains the identifier.

A typical usage sequence that includes the `DECLARE STATEMENT` directive might be:

```text
EXEC SQL DECLARE give_raise STATEMENT;      // give_raise is now a statement
handle (not prepared)
EXEC SQL PREPARE give_raise FROM :stmtText; // give_raise is now associated
with a statement
EXEC SQL EXECUTE give_raise;
```

This statement has no effect and is provided for Pro\*C compatibility only.

### DELETE

Use the `DELETE` statement to delete one or more rows from a table. The syntax for the ECPGPlus `DELETE` statement is the same as the syntax for the SQL statement, but you can use parameter markers and host variables any place that an expression is allowed. The syntax is:

```text
[FOR <exec_count>] DELETE FROM [ONLY] <table> [[AS] <alias>]
  [USING <using_list>]
  [WHERE <condition> | WHERE CURRENT OF <cursor_name>]
  [{RETURNING|RETURN} * | <output_expression> [[AS] <output_name>]
[, ...] INTO <host_variable_list> ]
```

Where:

Include the `FOR exec_count` clause to specify the number of times the statement will execute; this clause is valid only if the `VALUES` clause references an array or a pointer to an array.

`table` is the name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing table. Include the `ONLY` clause to limit processing to the specified table; if you do not include the `ONLY` clause, any tables inheriting from the named table are also processed.

`alias` is a substitute name for the target table.

`using_list` is a list of table expressions, allowing columns from other tables to appear in the `WHERE` condition.

Include the `WHERE` clause to specify which rows should be deleted. If you do not include a `WHERE` clause in the statement, `DELETE` will delete all rows from the table, leaving the table definition intact.

`condition` is an expression, host variable or parameter marker that returns a value of type `BOOLEAN`. Those rows for which `condition` returns true will be deleted.

`cursor_name` is the name of the cursor to use in the `WHERE CURRENT OF` clause; the row to be deleted will be the one most recently fetched from this cursor. The cursor must be a non-grouping query on the `DELETE` statements target table. You cannot specify `WHERE CURRENT OF` in a `DELETE` statement that includes a Boolean condition.

The `RETURN/RETURNING` clause specifies an `output_expression` or `host_variable_list` that is returned by the `DELETE` command after each row is deleted:

-   `output_expression` is an expression to be computed and returned by the `DELETE` command after each row is deleted. `output_name` is the name of the returned column; include \* to return all columns.

-   `host_variable_list` is a comma-separated list of host variables and optional indicator variables. Each host variable receives a corresponding value from the `RETURNING` clause.

For example, the following statement deletes all rows from the `emp` table where the `sal` column contains a value greater than the value specified in the host variable, `:max_sal:`

```text
DELETE FROM emp WHERE sal > :max_sal;
```

For more information about using the `DELETE` statement, see the PostgreSQL Core documentation available at:

 <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/sql-delete.html>

### DESCRIBE

Use the `DESCRIBE` statement to find the number of input values required by a prepared statement or the number of output values returned by a prepared statement. The `DESCRIBE` statement is used to analyze a SQL statement whose shape is unknown at the time you write your application.

The `DESCRIBE` statement populates an `SQLDA` descriptor; to populate a SQL descriptor, use the `ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR` and `DESCRIBE...DESCRIPTOR` statements.

```text
EXEC SQL DESCRIBE BIND VARIABLES FOR <statement_name> INTO <descriptor>;
```

or

```text
EXEC SQL DESCRIBE SELECT LIST FOR <statement_name> INTO <descriptor>;
```

Where:

`statement_name` is the identifier associated with a prepared SQL statement or PL/SQL block.

`descriptor` is the name of C variable of type `SQLDA*`. You must allocate the space for the descriptor by calling `sqlald()` (and initialize the descriptor) before executing the `DESCRIBE` statement.

When you execute the first form of the `DESCRIBE` statement, ECPG populates the given descriptor with a description of each input variable *required* by the statement. For example, given two descriptors:

```text
SQLDA *query_values_in;
SQLDA *query_values_out;
```

You might prepare a query that returns information from the `emp` table:

```text
EXEC SQL PREPARE get_emp FROM
  "SELECT ename, empno, sal FROM emp WHERE empno = ?";
```

The command requires one input variable (for the parameter marker (?)).

```text
EXEC SQL DESCRIBE BIND VARIABLES
  FOR get_emp INTO query_values_in;
```

After describing the bind variables for this statement, you can examine the descriptor to find the number of variables required and the type of each variable.

When you execute the second form, ECPG populates the given descriptor with a description of each value *returned* by the statement. For example, the following statement returns three values:

```text
EXEC SQL DESCRIBE SELECT LIST
  FOR get_emp INTO query_values_out;
```

After describing the select list for this statement, you can examine the descriptor to find the number of returned values and the name and type of each value.

Before *executing* the statement, you must bind a variable for each input value and a variable for each output value. The variables that you bind for the input values specify the actual values used by the statement. The variables that you bind for the output values tell ECPGPlus where to put the values when you execute the statement.

This is alternate Pro\*C compatible syntax for the `DESCRIBE DESCRIPTOR` statement.

### DESCRIBE DESCRIPTOR

Use the `DESCRIBE DESCRIPTOR` statement to retrieve information about a SQL statement, and store that information in a SQL descriptor. Before using `DESCRIBE DESCRIPTOR`, you must allocate the descriptor with the `ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR` statement. The syntax is:

```text
EXEC SQL DESCRIBE [INPUT | OUTPUT] <statement_identifier>
  USING [SQL] DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>;
```

Where:

`statement_name` is the name of a prepared SQL statement.

`descriptor_name` is the name of the descriptor. `descriptor_name` can be a quoted string value or a host variable that contains the name of the descriptor.

If you include the `INPUT` clause, ECPGPlus populates the given descriptor with a description of each input variable *required* by the statement.

For example, given two descriptors:

```text
EXEC SQL ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR query_values_in;
EXEC SQL ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR query_values_out;
```

You might prepare a query that returns information from the `emp` table:

```text
EXEC SQL PREPARE get_emp FROM
  "SELECT ename, empno, sal FROM emp WHERE empno = ?";
```

The command requires one input variable (for the parameter marker (?)).

```text
EXEC SQL DESCRIBE INPUT get_emp USING 'query_values_in';
```

After describing the bind variables for this statement, you can examine the descriptor to find the number of variables required and the type of each variable.

If you do not specify the `INPUT` clause, `DESCRIBE DESCRIPTOR` populates the specified descriptor with the values returned by the statement.

If you include the `OUTPUT` clause, ECPGPlus populates the given descriptor with a description of each value *returned* by the statement.

For example, the following statement returns three values:

```text
EXEC SQL DESCRIBE OUTPUT FOR get_emp USING 'query_values_out';
```

After describing the select list for this statement, you can examine the descriptor to find the number of returned values and the name and type of each value.

### DISCONNECT

Use the `DISCONNECT` statement to close the connection to the server. The syntax is:

```text
EXEC SQL DISCONNECT [<connection_name>][CURRENT][DEFAULT][ALL];
```

Where:

`connection_name` is the connection name specified in the `CONNECT` statement used to establish the connection. If you do not specify a connection name, the current connection is closed.

Include the `CURRENT` keyword to specify that ECPGPlus should close the most-recently used connection.

Include the `DEFAULT` keyword to specify that ECPGPlus should close the connection named `DEFAULT`. If you do not specify a name when opening a connection, ECPGPlus assigns the name, `DEFAULT`, to the connection.

Include the `ALL` keyword to instruct ECPGPlus to close all active connections.

The following example creates a connection (named `hr_connection`) that connects to the `hr` database, and then disconnects from the connection:

```text
/* client.pgc*/
int main()
{
    EXEC SQL CONNECT TO hr AS connection_name;
    EXEC SQL DISCONNECT connection_name;
    return(0);
}
```

### EXECUTE

Use the `EXECUTE` statement to execute a statement previously prepared using an `EXEC SQL PREPARE` statement. The syntax is:

```text
EXEC SQL [FOR <array_size>] EXECUTE <statement_name>
  [USING {DESCRIPTOR <SQLDA_descriptor>
  |: <host_variable> [[INDICATOR] :<indicator_variable>]}];
```

Where:

`array_size` is an integer value or a host variable that contains an integer value that specifies the number of rows to be processed. If you omit the `FOR` clause, the statement is executed once for each member of the array.

`statement_name` specifies the name assigned to the statement when the statement was created (using the `EXEC SQL PREPARE` statement).

Include the `USING` clause to supply values for parameters within the prepared statement:

-   Include the `DESCRIPTOR` `SQLDA_descriptor` clause to provide an SQLDA descriptor value for a parameter.

-   Use a `host_variable` (and an optional `indicator_variable`) to provide a user-specified value for a parameter.

The following example creates a prepared statement that inserts a record into the `emp` table:

```text
EXEC SQL PREPARE add_emp (numeric, text, text, numeric) AS
    INSERT INTO emp VALUES($1, $2, $3, $4);
```

Each time you invoke the prepared statement, provide fresh parameter values for the statement:

```text
EXEC SQL EXECUTE add_emp USING 8000, 'DAWSON', 'CLERK', 7788;
EXEC SQL EXECUTE add_emp USING 8001, 'EDWARDS', 'ANALYST', 7698;
```

### EXECUTE DESCRIPTOR

Use the `EXECUTE` statement to execute a statement previously prepared by an `EXEC SQL PREPARE` statement, using an SQL descriptor. The syntax is:

```text
EXEC SQL [FOR <array_size>] EXECUTE <statement_identifier>
  [USING [SQL] DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>]
  [INTO [SQL] DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>];
```

Where:

`array_size` is an integer value or a host variable that contains an integer value that specifies the number of rows to be processed. If you omit the `FOR` clause, the statement is executed once for each member of the array.

`statement_identifier` specifies the identifier assigned to the statement with the `EXEC SQL PREPARE` statement.

Include the `USING` clause to specify values for any input parameters required by the prepared statement.

Include the `INTO` clause to specify a descriptor into which the `EXECUTE` statement will write the results returned by the prepared statement.

`descriptor_name` specifies the name of a descriptor (as a single-quoted string literal), or a host variable that contains the name of a descriptor.

The following example executes the prepared statement, `give_raise`, using the values contained in the descriptor `stmtText:`

```text
EXEC SQL PREPARE give_raise FROM :stmtText;
EXEC SQL EXECUTE give_raise USING DESCRIPTOR :stmtText;
```

### EXECUTE...END EXEC

Use the `EXECUTE…END-EXEC` statement to embed an anonymous block into a client application. The syntax is:

```text
EXEC SQL [AT <database_name>] EXECUTE <anonymous_block> END-EXEC;
```

Where:

`database_name` is the database identifier or a host variable that contains the database identifier. If you omit the `AT` clause, the statement will be executed on the current default database.

`anonymous_block` is an inline sequence of PL/pgSQL or SPL statements and declarations. You may include host variables and optional indicator variables within the block; each such variable is treated as an `IN/OUT` value.

The following example executes an anonymous block:

```text
EXEC SQL EXECUTE
  BEGIN
    IF (current_user = :admin_user_name) THEN
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('You are an administrator');
    END IF;
END-EXEC;
```

!!! Note
    The `EXECUTE…END EXEC` statement is supported only by Advanced Server.

### EXECUTE IMMEDIATE

Use the `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` statement to execute a string that contains a SQL command. The syntax is:

```text
EXEC SQL [AT <database_name>] EXECUTE IMMEDIATE <command_text>;
```

Where:

`database_name` is the database identifier or a host variable that contains the database identifier. If you omit the `AT` clause, the statement will be executed on the current default database.

`command_text` is the command executed by the `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` statement.

This dynamic SQL statement is useful when you don't know the text of an SQL statement (ie., when writing a client application). For example, a client application may prompt a (trusted) user for a statement to execute. After the user provides the text of the statement as a string value, the statement is then executed with an `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` command.

The statement text may not contain references to host variables. If the statement may contain parameter markers or returns one or more values, you must use the `PREPARE` and `DESCRIBE` statements.

The following example executes the command contained in the `:command_text` host variable:

```text
EXEC SQL EXECUTE IMMEDIATE :command_text;
```

### FETCH

Use the `FETCH` statement to return rows from a cursor into an SQLDA descriptor or a target list of host variables. Before using a `FETCH` statement to retrieve information from a cursor, you must prepare the cursor using `DECLARE` and `OPEN` statements. The statement syntax is:

```text
EXEC SQL [FOR <array_size>] FETCH <cursor>
  { USING DESCRIPTOR <SQLDA_descriptor> }|{ INTO <target_list> };
```

Where:

`array_size` is an integer value or a host variable that contains an integer value specifying the number of rows to fetch. If you omit the `FOR` clause, the statement is executed once for each member of the array.

`cursor` is the name of the cursor from which rows are being fetched, or a host variable that contains the name of the cursor.

If you include a `USING` clause, the `FETCH` statement will populate the specified SQLDA descriptor with the values returned by the server.

If you include an `INTO` clause, the `FETCH` statement will populate the host variables (and optional indicator variables) specified in the `target_list`.

The following code fragment declares a cursor named `employees` that retrieves the `employee number`, `name` and `salary` from the `emp` table:

```text
EXEC SQL DECLARE employees CURSOR
    SELECT empno, ename, esal FROM emp
EXEC SQL OPEN emp_cursor
EXEC SQL FETCH emp_cursor INTO :emp_no, :emp_name, :emp_sal;
```

### FETCH DESCRIPTOR

Use the `FETCH DESCRIPTOR` statement to retrieve rows from a cursor into an SQL descriptor. The syntax is:

```text
EXEC SQL [FOR <array_size>] FETCH <cursor>
  INTO [SQL] DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>;
```

Where:

`array_size` is an integer value or a host variable that contains an integer value specifying the number of rows to fetch. If you omit the `FOR` clause, the statement is executed once for each member of the array.

`cursor` is the name of the cursor from which rows are fetched, or a host variable that contains the name of the cursor. The client must `DECLARE` and `OPEN` the cursor before calling the `FETCH DESCRIPTOR` statement.

Include the `INTO` clause to specify an SQL descriptor into which the `EXECUTE` statement will write the results returned by the prepared statement. `descriptor_name` specifies the name of a descriptor (as a single-quoted string literal), or a host variable that contains the name of a descriptor. Prior to use, the descriptor must be allocated using an `ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR` statement.

The following example allocates a descriptor named `row_desc` that will hold the description and the values of a specific row in the result set. It then declares and opens a cursor for a prepared statement (`my_cursor`), before looping through the rows in result set, using a `FETCH` to retrieve the next row from the cursor into the descriptor:

```text
EXEC SQL ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR 'row_desc';
EXEC SQL DECLARE my_cursor CURSOR FOR query;
EXEC SQL OPEN my_cursor;

for( row = 0; ; row++ )
{
  EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
    int col;
  EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;
  EXEC SQL FETCH my_cursor INTO SQL DESCRIPTOR 'row_desc';
```

### GET DESCRIPTOR

Use the `GET DESCRIPTOR` statement to retrieve information from a descriptor. The `GET DESCRIPTOR` statement comes in two forms. The first form returns the number of values (or columns) in the descriptor.

```text
EXEC SQL GET DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>
  :<host_variable> = COUNT;
```

The second form returns information about a specific value (specified by the `VALUE column_number` clause).

```text
EXEC SQL [FOR <array_size>] GET DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>
  VALUE <column_number> {:<host_variable> = <descriptor_item> {,…}};
```

Where:

`array_size` is an integer value or a host variable that contains an integer value that specifies the number of rows to be processed. If you specify an `array_size`, the `host_variable` must be an array of that size; for example, if `array_size` is `10`, `:host_variable` must be a 10-member array of `host_variables`. If you omit the `FOR` clause, the statement is executed once for each member of the array.

`descriptor_name` specifies the name of a descriptor (as a single-quoted string literal), or a host variable that contains the name of a descriptor.

Include the `VALUE` clause to specify the information retrieved from the descriptor.

-   `column_number` identifies the position of the variable within the descriptor.

-   `host_variable` specifies the name of the host variable that will receive the value of the item.

-   `descriptor_item` specifies the type of the retrieved descriptor item.

ECPGPlus implements the following `descriptor_item` types:

-   `TYPE`
-   `LENGTH`
-   `OCTET_LENGTH`
-   `RETURNED_LENGTH`
-   `RETURNED_OCTET_LENGTH`
-   `PRECISION`
-   `SCALE`
-   `NULLABLE`
-   `INDICATOR`
-   `DATA`
-   `NAME`

The following code fragment demonstrates using a `GET DESCRIPTOR` statement to obtain the number of columns entered in a user-provided string:

```text
EXEC SQL ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR parse_desc;
EXEC SQL PREPARE query FROM :stmt;
EXEC SQL DESCRIBE query INTO SQL DESCRIPTOR parse_desc;
EXEC SQL GET DESCRIPTOR parse_desc :col_count = COUNT;
```

The example allocates an SQL descriptor (named `parse_desc`), before using a `PREPARE` statement to syntax check the string provided by the user `(:stmt)`. A `DESCRIBE` statement moves the user-provided string into the descriptor, `parse_desc`. The call to `EXEC SQL GET DESCRIPTOR` interrogates the descriptor to discover the number of columns `(:col_count)` in the result set.

### INSERT

Use the `INSERT` statement to add one or more rows to a table. The syntax for the ECPGPlus `INSERT` statement is the same as the syntax for the SQL statement, but you can use parameter markers and host variables any place that a value is allowed. The syntax is:

```text
[FOR <exec_count>] INSERT INTO <table> [(<column> [, ...])]
  {DEFAULT VALUES |
   VALUES ({<expression> | DEFAULT} [, ...])[, ...] | <query>}
  [RETURNING * | <output_expression> [[ AS ] <output_name>] [, ...]]
```

Where:

Include the `FOR exec_count` clause to specify the number of times the statement will execute; this clause is valid only if the `VALUES` clause references an array or a pointer to an array.

`table` specifies the (optionally schema-qualified) name of an existing table.

`column` is the name of a column in the table. The column name may be qualified with a subfield name or array subscript. Specify the `DEFAULT VALUES` clause to use default values for all columns.

`expression` is the expression, value, host variable or parameter marker that will be assigned to the corresponding column. Specify `DEFAULT` to fill the corresponding column with its default value.

`query` specifies a `SELECT` statement that supplies the row(s) to be inserted.

`output_expression` is an expression that will be computed and returned by the `INSERT` command after each row is inserted. The expression can refer to any column within the table. Specify \* to return all columns of the inserted row(s).

`output_name` specifies a name to use for a returned column.

The following example adds a row to the `employees` table:

```text
INSERT INTO emp (empno, ename, job, hiredate)
    VALUES ('8400', :ename, 'CLERK', '2011-10-31');
```

!!! Note
    The `INSERT` statement uses a host variable `(:ename)` to specify the value of the `ename` column.

For more information about using the `INSERT` statement, see the PostgreSQL Core documentation available at:

 <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/sql-insert.html>

### OPEN

Use the `OPEN` statement to open a cursor. The syntax is:

```text
EXEC SQL [FOR <array_size>] OPEN <cursor> [USING <parameters>];
```

Where `parameters` is one of the following:

```text
DESCRIPTOR <SQLDA_descriptor>
```

or

```text
<host_variable> [ [ INDICATOR ] <indicator_variable>, … ]
```

Where:

`array_size` is an integer value or a host variable that contains an integer value specifying the number of rows to fetch. If you omit the `FOR` clause, the statement is executed once for each member of the array.

`cursor` is the name of the cursor being opened.

`parameters` is either `DESCRIPTOR SQLDA_descriptor` or a comma-separated list of `host variables` (and optional `indicator variables`) that initialize the cursor. If specifying an `SQLDA_descriptor`, the descriptor must be initialized with a `DESCRIBE` statement.

The `OPEN` statement initializes a cursor using the values provided in `parameters`. Once initialized, the cursor result set will remain unchanged unless the cursor is closed and re-opened. A cursor is automatically closed when an application terminates.

The following example declares a cursor named `employees`, that queries the `emp` table, returning the `employee number`, `name`, `salary` and `commission` of an employee whose name matches a user-supplied value (stored in the host variable, `:emp_name`).

```text
  EXEC SQL DECLARE employees CURSOR FOR
    SELECT
      empno, ename, sal, comm 
    FROM 
      emp
    WHERE ename = :emp_name;
  EXEC SQL OPEN employees;
...
```

After declaring the cursor, the example uses an `OPEN` statement to make the contents of the cursor available to a client application.

### OPEN DESCRIPTOR

Use the `OPEN DESCRIPTOR` statement to open a cursor with a SQL descriptor. The syntax is:

```text
EXEC SQL [FOR <array_size>] OPEN <cursor>
  [USING [SQL] DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>]
  [INTO [SQL] DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>];
```

Where:

`array_size` is an integer value or a host variable that contains an integer value specifying the number of rows to fetch. If you omit the `FOR` clause, the statement is executed once for each member of the array.

`cursor` is the name of the cursor being opened.

`descriptor_name` specifies the name of an SQL descriptor (in the form of a single-quoted string literal) or a host variable that contains the name of an SQL descriptor that contains the query that initializes the cursor.

For example, the following statement opens a cursor (named `emp_cursor`), using the host variable, `:employees`:

```text
EXEC SQL OPEN emp_cursor USING DESCRIPTOR :employees;
```

### PREPARE

Prepared statements are useful when a client application must perform a task multiple times; the statement is parsed, written and planned only once, rather than each time the statement is executed, saving repetitive processing time.

Use the `PREPARE` statement to prepare an SQL statement or PL/pgSQL block for execution. The statement is available in two forms; the first form is:

```text
EXEC SQL [AT <database_name>] PREPARE <statement_name>
  FROM <sql_statement>;
```

The second form is:

```text
EXEC SQL [AT <database_name>] PREPARE <statement_name>
  AS <sql_statement>;
```

Where:

`database_name` is the database identifier or a host variable that contains the database identifier against which the statement will execute. If you omit the `AT` clause, the statement will execute against the current default database.

`statement_name` is the identifier associated with a prepared SQL statement or PL/SQL block.

`sql_statement` may take the form of a `SELECT` statement, a single-quoted string literal or host variable that contains the text of an SQL statement.

To include variables within a prepared statement, substitute placeholders (`$1, $2, $3`, etc.) for statement values that might change when you `PREPARE` the statement. When you `EXECUTE` the statement, provide a value for each parameter. The values must be provided in the order in which they will replace placeholders.

The following example creates a prepared statement (named `add_emp`) that inserts a record into the `emp` table:

```text
EXEC SQL PREPARE add_emp (int, text, text, numeric) AS
    INSERT INTO emp VALUES($1, $2, $3, $4);
```

Each time you invoke the statement, provide fresh parameter values for the statement:

```text
EXEC SQL EXECUTE add_emp(8003, 'Davis', 'CLERK', 2000.00);
EXEC SQL EXECUTE add_emp(8004, 'Myer', 'CLERK', 2000.00);
```

!!! Note
    A client application must issue a `PREPARE` statement within each session in which a statement will be executed; prepared statements persist only for the duration of the current session.

### ROLLBACK

Use the `ROLLBACK` statement to abort the current transaction, and discard any updates made by the transaction. The syntax is:

```text
EXEC SQL [AT <database_name>] ROLLBACK [WORK]
  [ { TO [SAVEPOINT] <savepoint> } | RELEASE ]
```

Where:

`database_name` is the database identifier or a host variable that contains the database identifier against which the statement will execute. If you omit the `AT` clause, the statement will execute against the current default database.

Include the `TO` clause to abort any commands that were executed after the specified `savepoint`; use the `SAVEPOINT` statement to define the `savepoint`. If you omit the `TO` clause, the `ROLLBACK` statement will abort the transaction, discarding all updates.

Include the `RELEASE` clause to cause the application to execute an `EXEC SQL COMMIT RELEASE` and close the connection.

Use the following statement to rollback a complete transaction:

```text
EXEC SQL ROLLBACK;
```

Invoking this statement will abort the transaction, undoing all changes, erasing any savepoints, and releasing all transaction locks. If you include a savepoint (`my_savepoint` in the following example):

```text
EXEC SQL ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
```

Only the portion of the transaction that occurred after the `my_savepoint` is rolled back; `my_savepoint` is retained, but any savepoints created after `my_savepoint` will be erased.

Rolling back to a specified savepoint releases all locks acquired after the savepoint.

### SAVEPOINT

Use the `SAVEPOINT` statement to define a `savepoint`; a savepoint is a marker within a transaction. You can use a `ROLLBACK` statement to abort the current transaction, returning the state of the server to its condition prior to the specified savepoint. The syntax of a `SAVEPOINT` statement is:

```text
EXEC SQL [AT <database_name>] SAVEPOINT <savepoint_name>
```

Where:

`database_name` is the database identifier or a host variable that contains the database identifier against which the savepoint resides. If you omit the `AT` clause, the statement will execute against the current default database.

`savepoint_name` is the name of the savepoint. If you re-use a `savepoint_name`, the original savepoint is discarded.

Savepoints can only be established within a transaction block. A transaction block may contain multiple savepoints.

To create a savepoint named `my_savepoint`, include the statement:

```text
EXEC SQL SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
```

### SELECT

ECPGPlus extends support of the `SQL SELECT` statement by providing the `INTO host_variables` clause. The clause allows you to select specified information from an Advanced Server database into a host variable. The syntax for the `SELECT` statement is:

```text
EXEC SQL [AT <database_name>]
SELECT
  [ <hint> ]
  [ ALL | DISTINCT [ ON( <expression>, ...) ]]
  select_list INTO <host_variables>
  
  [ FROM from_item [, from_item ]...]
  [ WHERE condition ]
  [ hierarchical_query_clause ]
  [ GROUP BY expression [, ...]]
  [ HAVING condition ]
  [ { UNION [ ALL ] | INTERSECT | MINUS } (subquery) ]
  [ ORDER BY expression> [order_by_options]]
  [ LIMIT { count | ALL }]
  [ OFFSET start [ ROW | ROWS ] ]
  [ FETCH { FIRST | NEXT } [ count ] { ROW | ROWS } ONLY ]
  [ FOR { UPDATE | SHARE } [OF table_name [, ...]][NOWAIT ][...]]
```

Where:

`database_name` is the name of the database (or host variable that contains the name of the database) in which the table resides. This value may take the form of an unquoted string literal, or of a host variable.

`host_variables` is a list of host variables that will be populated by the `SELECT` statement. If the `SELECT` statement returns more than a single row, `host_variables` must be an array.

ECPGPlus provides support for the additional clauses of the SQL `SELECT` statement as documented in the PostgreSQL Core documentation available at:

 <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/sql-select.html>

To use the `INTO` `host_variables` clause, include the names of defined host variables when specifying the `SELECT` statement. For example, the following `SELECT` statement populates the `:emp_name` and `:emp_sal` host variables with a list of `employee names` and `salaries`:

```text
EXEC SQL SELECT ename, sal
  INTO :emp_name, :emp_sal
  FROM emp
  WHERE empno = 7988;
```

The enhanced `SELECT` statement also allows you to include parameter markers (question marks) in any clause where a value would be permitted. For example, the following query contains a parameter marker in the `WHERE` clause:

```text
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE dept_no = ?;
```

This `SELECT` statement allows you to provide a value at run-time for the `dept_no` parameter marker.

### SET CONNECTION

There are (at least) three reasons you may need more than one connection in a given client application:

-   You may want different privileges for different statements;
-   You may need to interact with multiple databases within the same client.
-   Multiple threads of execution (within a client application) cannot share a connection concurrently.

The syntax for the `SET CONNECTION` statement is:

```text
EXEC SQL SET CONNECTION <connection_name>;
```

Where:

`connection_name` is the name of the connection to the database.

To use the `SET CONNECTION` statement, you should open the connection to the database using the second form of the `CONNECT` statement; include the AS clause to specify a `connection_name`.

By default, the current thread uses the current connection; use the `SET CONNECTION` statement to specify a default connection for the current thread to use. The default connection is only used when you execute an `EXEC SQL` statement that does not explicitly specify a connection name. For example, the following statement will use the default connection because it does not include an `AT` `connection_name` clause. :

```text
EXEC SQL DELETE FROM emp;
```

This statement will not use the default connection because it specifies a connection name using the `AT` `connection_name` clause:

```text
EXEC SQL AT acctg_conn DELETE FROM emp;
```

For example, a client application that creates and maintains multiple connections (such as):

```text
EXEC SQL CONNECT TO edb AS acctg_conn
  USER 'alice' IDENTIFIED BY 'acctpwd';
```

and

```text
EXEC SQL CONNECT TO edb AS hr_conn
  USER 'bob' IDENTIFIED BY 'hrpwd';
```

Can change between the connections with the `SET CONNECTION` statement:

```text
SET CONNECTION acctg_conn;
```

or

```text
SET CONNECTION hr_conn;
```

The server will use the privileges associated with the connection when determining the privileges available to the connecting client. When using the `acctg_conn` connection, the client will have the privileges associated with the role, `alice`; when connected using `hr_conn`, the client will have the privileges associated with `bob`.

### SET DESCRIPTOR

Use the `SET DESCRIPTOR` statement to assign a value to a descriptor area using information provided by the client application in the form of a host variable or an integer value. The statement comes in two forms; the first form is:

```text
EXEC SQL [FOR <array_size>] SET DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>
  VALUE <column_number> <descriptor_item> = <host_variable>;
```

The second form is:

```text
EXEC SQL [FOR <array_size>] SET DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>
  COUNT = integer;
```

Where:

`array_size` is an integer value or a host variable that contains an integer value specifying the number of rows to fetch. If you omit the `FOR` clause, the statement is executed once for each member of the array.

`descriptor_name` specifies the name of a descriptor (as a single-quoted string literal), or a host variable that contains the name of a descriptor.

Include the `VALUE` clause to describe the information stored in the descriptor.

-   `column_number` identifies the position of the variable within the descriptor.

-   `descriptor_item` specifies the type of the descriptor item.

-   `host_variable` specifies the name of the host variable that contains the value of the item.

ECPGPlus implements the following `descriptor_item` types:

-   `TYPE`
-   `LENGTH`
-   `[REF] INDICATOR`
-   `[REF] DATA`
-   `[REF] RETURNED LENGTH`

For example, a client application might prompt a user for a dynamically created query:

```text
query_text = promptUser("Enter a query");
```

To execute a dynamically created query, you must first `prepare` the query (parsing and validating the syntax of the query), and then `describe` the `input` parameters found in the query using the `EXEC SQL DESCRIBE INPUT` statement.

```text
EXEC SQL ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR query_params;
EXEC SQL PREPARE emp_query FROM :query_text;

EXEC SQL DESCRIBE INPUT emp_query
  USING SQL DESCRIPTOR 'query_params';
```

After describing the query, the `query_params` descriptor contains information about each parameter required by the query.

For this example, we'll assume that the user has entered:

```text
SELECT ename FROM emp WHERE sal > ? AND job = ?;,
```

In this case, the descriptor describes two parameters, one for `sal > ?` and one for `job = ?`.

To discover the number of parameter markers (question marks) in the query (and therefore, the number of values you must provide before executing the query), use:

```text
EXEC SQL GET DESCRIPTOR … :host_variable = COUNT;
```

Then, you can use `EXEC SQL GET DESCRIPTOR` to retrieve the name of each parameter. You can also use `EXEC SQL GET DESCRIPTOR` to retrieve the type of each parameter (along with the number of parameters) from the descriptor, or you can supply each `value` in the form of a character string and ECPG will convert that string into the required data type.

The data type of the first parameter is `numeric`; the type of the second parameter is `varchar`. The name of the first parameter is `sal`; the name of the second parameter is `job`.

Next, loop through each parameter, prompting the user for a value, and store those values in host variables. You can use `GET DESCRIPTOR … COUNT` to find the number of parameters in the query.

```text
EXEC SQL GET DESCRIPTOR 'query_params'
  :param_count = COUNT;

for(param_number = 1;
    param_number <= param_count;
    param_number++)
{
```

Use `GET DESCRIPTOR` to copy the name of the parameter into the `param_name` host variable:

```text
EXEC SQL GET DESCRIPTOR 'query_params'
  VALUE :param_number :param_name = NAME;

reply = promptUser(param_name);
if (reply == NULL)
 reply_ind = 1; /* NULL */
else
 reply_ind = 0; /* NOT NULL */
```

To associate a `value` with each parameter, you use the `EXEC SQL SET DESCRIPTOR` statement. For example:

```text
EXEC SQL SET DESCRIPTOR 'query_params'
  VALUE :param_number DATA = :reply;
EXEC SQL SET DESCRIPTOR 'query_params'
  VALUE :param_number INDICATOR = :reply_ind;
}
```

Now, you can use the `EXEC SQL EXECUTE DESCRIPTOR` statement to execute the prepared statement on the server.

### UPDATE

Use an `UPDATE` statement to modify the data stored in a table. The syntax is:

```text
EXEC SQL [AT <database_name>][FOR <exec_count>]
    UPDATE [ ONLY ] table [ [ AS ] alias ]
    SET {column = { expression | DEFAULT } |
        (column [, ...]) = ({ expression|DEFAULT } [, ...])} [, ...]
    [ FROM from_list ]
    [ WHERE condition | WHERE CURRENT OF cursor_name ]
    [ RETURNING * | output_expression [[ AS ] output_name] [, ...] ]
```

Where:

`database_name` is the name of the database (or host variable that contains the name of the database) in which the table resides. This value may take the form of an unquoted string literal, or of a host variable.

Include the `FOR exec_count` clause to specify the number of times the statement will execute; this clause is valid only if the `SET` or `WHERE` clause contains an array.

ECPGPlus provides support for the additional clauses of the SQL `UPDATE` statement as documented in the PostgreSQL Core documentation available at:

 <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/sql-update.html>

A host variable can be used in any clause that specifies a value. To use a host variable, simply substitute a defined variable for any value associated with any of the documented `UPDATE` clauses.

The following `UPDATE` statement changes the job description of an employee (identified by the `:ename` host variable) to the value contained in the `:new_job` host variable, and increases the employees salary, by multiplying the current salary by the value in the `:increase` host variable:

```text
EXEC SQL UPDATE emp
  SET job = :new_job, sal = sal * :increase
  WHERE ename = :ename;
```

The enhanced `UPDATE` statement also allows you to include parameter markers (question marks) in any clause where an input value would be permitted. For example, we can write the same update statement with a parameter marker in the `WHERE` clause:

```text
EXEC SQL UPDATE emp
  SET job = ?, sal = sal * ?
  WHERE ename = :ename;
```

This `UPDATE` statement could allow you to prompt the user for a new value for the `job` column and provide the amount by which the `sal` column is incremented for the employee specified by `:ename`.

### WHENEVER

Use the `WHENEVER` statement to specify the action taken by a client application when it encounters an SQL error or warning. The syntax is:

```text
EXEC SQL WHENEVER <condition> <action>;
```

The following table describes the different conditions that might trigger an `action`:

| **Condition** | **Description**                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NOT FOUND`   | The server returns a `NOT FOUND` condition when it encounters a `SELECT` that returns no rows, or when a `FETCH` reaches the end of a result set. |
| `SQLERROR`    | The server returns an `SQLERROR` condition when it encounters a serious error returned by an SQL statement.                                       |
| `SQLWARNING`  | The server returns an `SQLWARNING` condition when it encounters a non-fatal warning returned by an SQL statement.                                 |

The following table describes the actions that result from a client encountering a `condition`:

| **Action**                    | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CALL function [([args])]`    | Instructs the client application to call the named `function`.                                                                                                                                              |
| `CONTINUE`                    | Instructs the client application to proceed to the next statement.                                                                                                                                          |
| `DO BREAK`                    | Instructs the client application to a C break statement. A break statement may appear in a `loop` or a `switch` statement. If executed, the break statement terminate the `loop` or the `switch` statement. |
| `DO CONTINUE`                 | Instructs the client application to emit a C `continue` statement. A `continue` statement may only exist within a loop, and if executed, will cause the flow of control to return to the top of the loop.   |
| `DO function ([args])`        | Instructs the client application to call the named `function`.                                                                                                                                              |
| `GOTO label` or `GO TO label` | Instructs the client application to proceed to the statement that contains the `label`.                                                                                                                     |
| `SQLPRINT`                    | Instructs the client application to print a message to standard error.                                                                                                                                      |
| `STOP`                        | Instructs the client application to stop execution.                                                                                                                                                         |

The following code fragment prints a message if the client application encounters a warning, and aborts the application if it encounters an error:

```text
EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLWARNING SQLPRINT;
EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR STOP;
```

Include the following code to specify that a client should continue processing after warning a user of a problem:

```text
EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLWARNING SQLPRINT;
```

Include the following code to call a function if a query returns no rows, or when a cursor reaches the end of a result set:

```text
EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND CALL error_handler(__LINE__);
```
