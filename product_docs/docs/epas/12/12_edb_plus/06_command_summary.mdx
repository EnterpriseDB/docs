<div id="command_summary" class="registered_link"></div>




The following sections contains a summary of EDB\*Plus commands.

## ACCEPT



The ACCEPT command displays a prompt and waits for the user’s keyboard input. The value input by the user is placed in the specified variable.

`ACC[EPT ] variable`

The following example creates a new variable named my\_name, accepts a value of John Smith, then displays the value using the DEFINE command.

    SQL> ACCEPT my_name
    Enter value for my_name: John Smith
    SQL> DEFINE my_name
    DEFINE MY_NAME = "John Smith"

## APPEND



APPEND is a line editor command that appends the given text to the end of the current line in the SQL buffer.

`A[PPEND ] text`

In the following example, a SELECT command is built-in the SQL buffer using the APPEND command. Note that two spaces are placed between the APPEND command and the WHERE clause in order to separate dept and WHERE by one space in the SQL buffer.

    SQL> APPEND SELECT * FROM dept
    SQL> LIST
    1 SELECT * FROM dept
    SQL> APPEND WHERE deptno = 10
    SQL> LIST
    1 SELECT * FROM dept WHERE deptno = 10

## CHANGE



CHANGE is a line editor command performs a search-and-replace on the current line in the SQL buffer.

`C[HANGE ] FROM [ TO ]`

If `TO`/ is specified, the first occurrence of text `FROM` in the current line is changed to text `TO`. If `TO`/ is omitted, the first occurrence of text `FROM` in the current line is deleted.

The following sequence of commands makes line 3 the current line, then changes the department number in the WHERE clause from 20 to 30.

    SQL> LIST
    1 SELECT empno, ename, job, sal, comm
    2 FROM emp
    3 WHERE deptno = 20
    4* ORDER BY empno
    SQL> 3
    3* WHERE deptno = 20
    SQL> CHANGE /20/30/
    3* WHERE deptno = 30
    SQL> LIST
    1 SELECT empno, ename, job, sal, comm
    2 FROM emp
    3 WHERE deptno = 30
    4* ORDER BY empno

## CLEAR



The CLEAR command removes the contents of the SQL buffer, deletes all column definitions set with the COLUMN command, or clears the screen.

    CL[EAR ] [ BUFF[ER ] | SQL | COL[UMNS ] | SCR[EEN ] ]  BUFFER | SQL

Clears the SQL buffer.

`COLUMNS`

Removes column definitions.

`SCREEN`

Clears the screen. This is the default if no options are specified.

## COLUMN



The COLUMN command controls output formatting. The formatting attributes set by using the COLUMN command remain in effect only for the duration of the current session.

    COL[UMN ]
    [ column
    { CLE[AR ] |
    { FOR[MAT ] spec |
    HEA[DING ] text |
    { OFF | ON }
    } [...]
    }
    ]

If the `COLUMN` command is specified with no subsequent options, formatting options for current columns in effect for the session are displayed.

If the COLUMN command is followed by a column name, then the column name may be followed by one of the following:

> 1.  No other options
> 2.  `CLEAR`
> 3.  Any combination of `FORMAT`, `HEADING`, and one of `OFF` or `ON`

`column`

Name of a column in a table to which subsequent column formatting options are to apply. If no other options follow `column`, then the current column formatting options if any, of `column` are displayed.

`CLEAR`

The CLEAR option reverts all formatting options back to their defaults for `column`. If the `CLEAR` option is specified, it must be the only option specified.

`spec`

Format specification to be applied to `column`. For character columns, `spec` takes the following format:

`n`

`n` is a positive integer that specifies the column width in characters within which to display the data. Data in excess of `n` will wrap around with the specified column width.

For numeric columns, `spec` is comprised of the following elements.

> Table ‑ Numeric Column Format Elements

|         |                                            |
|---------|--------------------------------------------|
| Element | Description                                |
| $       | Display a leading dollar sign.             |
| ,       | Display a comma in the indicated position. |
| .       | Marks the location of the decimal point.   |
| 0       | Display leading zeros.                     |
| 9       | Number of significant digits to display.   |

If loss of significant digits occurs due to overflow of the format, then all \#’s are displayed.

`text`

Text to be used for the column heading of `column`.

`OFF` \| `ON`

If OFF is specified, formatting options are reverted back to their defaults, but are still available within the session. If ON is specified, the formatting options specified by previous COLUMN commands for `column` within the session are re-activated.

The following example shows the effect of changing the display width of the job column.

    SQL> SET PAGESIZE 9999
    SQL> COLUMN job FORMAT A5
    SQL> COLUMN job
    COLUMN JOB ON
    FORMAT A5
    wrapped
    SQL> SELECT empno, ename, job FROM emp;

The following example applies a format to the `sal` column.

    SQL> COLUMN sal FORMAT $99,999.00
    SQL> COLUMN
    COLUMN JOB ON
    FORMAT A5
    wrapped
    COLUMN SAL ON

    14 rows retrieved.

## CONNECT



Change the database connection to a different user and/or connect to a different database. There must be no white space between any of the parameters following the CONNECT command.

`CON[NECT] username [/password][@{ connectstring | variable }]`

Where:

`username` is a database username with which to connect to the database.

`password` is the password associated with the specified `username`. If a `password` is not provided, but a password is required for authentication, a search is made for a password file, first in the home directory of the Linux operating system account invoking EDB\*Plus (or in the `%APPDATA%\postgresql\` directory for Windows) and then at the location specified by the PGPASSFILE environment variable. The password file is `.pgpass` on Linux hosts and `pgpass.conf` on Windows hosts. The following is an example on a Windows host:

> `C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\postgresql\pgpass.conf`

If a password file cannot be located, or it does not have an entry matching the EDB\*Plus connection parameters, then EDB\*Plus will prompt for the password. For more information about password files, see the PostgreSQL core documentation at:

> <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/libpq-pgpass.html>

**Note:** When a password is not required, EDB\*Plus does not prompt for a password such as when the trust authentication method is specified in the `pg_hba.conf` file. For more information about the `pg_hba.conf` file and authentication methods, see the PostgreSQL core documentation at:

> <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html>

`connectstring` is the database connection string. See Section 2.2 for further information on the database connection string.

`variable` is a variable defined in the `login.sql` file that contains a database connection string. The `login.sql` file can be found in the `edbplus` subdirectory of the Advanced Server home directory.

In the following example, the database connection is changed to database `edb` on the `localhost` at port `5445` with username `smith`.

    SQL> CONNECT smith/mypassword@localhost:5445/edb
    Disconnected from EnterpriseDB Database.
    Connected to EnterpriseDB 10.0.1 (localhost:5445/edb) AS smith

From within the session shown above, the connection is changed to username `enterprisedb`. Also note that the host defaults to the `localhost`, the port defaults to `5444` (which is not the same as the port previously used), and the database defaults to `edb`.

    SQL> CONNECT enterprisedb/password
    Disconnected from EnterpriseDB Database.
    Connected to EnterpriseDB 10.0.1 (localhost:5444/edb) AS enterprisedb

## DEFINE



The DEFINE command creates or replaces the value of a *user variable* (also called a *substitution variable*).

`DEF[INE ] [ <variable> [ = <text> ] ]`

If the DEFINE command is given without any parameters, all current variables and their values are displayed.

If DEFINE `variable` is given, only `variable` is displayed with its value.

`DEFINE variable = text` assigns `text` to `variable`. `text` may be optionally enclosed within single or double quotation marks. Quotation marks must be used if `text` contains space characters.

The following example defines two variables, dept and name.

    SQL> DEFINE dept = 20
    SQL> DEFINE name = 'John Smith'
    SQL> DEFINE
    DEFINE EDB = "localhost:5445/edb"
    DEFINE DEPT = "20"
    DEFINE NAME = "John Smith"

**Note:** The variable EDB is read from the login.sql file located in the edbplus subdirectory of the Advanced Server home directory.

## DEL



DEL is a line editor command that deletes one or more lines from the SQL buffer.

`DEL [ n | n m | n * | n L[AST ] | n | L[AST ] | L[AST ] ]`

The parameters specify which lines are to be deleted from the SQL buffer. Two parameters specify the start and end of a range of lines to be deleted. If the DEL command is given with no parameters, the current line is deleted.

`n`

`n` is an integer representing the `n`th line

`n` `m`

`n` and `m` are integers where `m` is greater than `n` representing the `n`th through the `m`th lines

-   Current line

`LAST`

Last line

In the following example, the fifth and sixth lines containing columns `sal` and `comm`, respectively, are deleted from the SELECT command in the SQL buffer.

    SQL> LIST
    1 SELECT
    2 empno
    3 ,ename
    4 ,job
    5 ,sal
    6 ,comm
    7 ,deptno
    8* FROM emp
    SQL> DEL 5 6
    SQL> LIST
    1 SELECT
    2 empno
    3 ,ename
    4 ,job
    5 ,deptno
    6\* FROM emp

## DESCRIBE



The DESCRIBE command displays:

-   A list of columns, column data types, and column lengths for a table or view
-   A list of parameters for a procedure or function
-   A list of procedures and functions and their respective parameters for a package.

The DESCRIBE command will also display the structure of the database object referred to by a synonym. The syntax is:

`DESC[RIBE] [ <schema>.] <object>`

`schema`

Name of the schema containing the object to be described.

`object`

Name of the table, view, procedure, function, or package to be displayed, or the synonym of an object.

## DISCONNECT



The DISCONNECT command closes the current database connection, but does not terminate EDB\*Plus.

> `DISC[ONNECT ]`

## EDIT



The EDIT command invokes an external editor to edit the contents of an operating system file or the SQL buffer.

> `ED[IT ] [ <filename> [.<ext> ] ]`

&lt;filename&gt; \[.&lt;ext&gt; \]

`filename` is the name of the file to open with an external editor. `ext` is the filename extension. If the filename extension is sql, then the .sql extension may be omitted when specifying `filename`. EDIT always assumes a .sql extension on filenames that are specified with no extension. If the filename parameter is omitted from the EDIT command, the contents of the SQL buffer are brought into the editor.

## EXECUTE



The EXECUTE command executes an SPL procedure from EDB\*Plus.

> `EXEC[UTE ] <spl_procedure> [ ([ <parameters> ]) ]`

`spl_procedure`

The name of the SPL procedure to be executed.

`parameters`

Comma-delimited list of parameters. If there are no parameters, then a pair of empty parentheses may optionally be specified.

## EXIT



The EXIT command terminates the EDB\*Plus session and returns control to the operating system. QUIT is a synonym for EXIT. Specifying no parameters is equivalent to EXIT SUCCESS COMMIT.

    { EXIT | QUIT }
    [ SUCCESS | FAILURE | WARNING | <value> | <variable> ]
    [ COMMIT | ROLLBACK ]SUCCESS | FAILURE |WARNING]

Returns an operating system dependent return code indicating successful operation, failure, or warning for SUCCESS, FAILURE, and WARNING, respectively. The default is SUCCESS.

`value`

An integer value that is returned as the return code.

`variable`

A variable created with the DEFINE command whose value is returned as the return code.

COMMIT \| ROLLBACK

If COMMIT is specified, uncommitted updates are committed upon exit. If ROLLBACK is specified, uncommitted updates are rolled back upon exit. The default is COMMIT.

## GET



The GET command loads the contents of the given file to the SQL buffer.

> `GET filename[.<ext> ] [ LIS[T ] | NOL[IST ] ]`

`filename` \[.&lt;ext&gt; \]

`filename` is the name of the file to load into the SQL buffer. `ext` is the filename extension. If the filename extension is sql, then the .sql extension may be omitted when specifying `filename`. GET always assumes a .sql extension on filenames that are specified with no extension.

`LIST | NOLIST`

If LIST is specified, the content of the SQL buffer is displayed after the file is loaded. If NOLIST is specified, no listing is displayed. The default is LIST.

## HELP



The HELP command obtains an index of topics or help on a specific topic. The question mark (?) is synonymous with specifying HELP.

> `{ HELP | ? } { INDEX | <topic> }`

`INDEX`

Displays an index of available topics.

`topic`

The name of a specific topic – e.g., an EDB\*Plus command, for which help is desired.

## HOST



The HOST command executes an operating system command from EDB\*Plus.

> `HO[ST ] [<os_command>]`

`os_command`

The operating system command to be executed. If you do not provide an operating system command, EDB\*Plus pauses execution and opens a new shell prompt. When the shell exits, EDB\*Plus resumes execution.

## INPUT



The INPUT line editor command adds a line of text to the SQL buffer after the current line.

> `I[NPUT ] <text>`

The following sequence of INPUT commands constructs a SELECT command.

    SQL> INPUT SELECT empno, ename, job, sal, comm
    SQL> INPUT FROM emp
    SQL> INPUT WHERE deptno = 20
    SQL> INPUT ORDER BY empno
    SQL> LIST
    1 SELECT empno, ename, job, sal, comm
    2 FROM emp
    3 WHERE deptno = 20
    4* ORDER BY empno

## LIST



LIST is a line editor command that displays the contents of the SQL buffer.

`L[IST] [ n | n m | n * | n L[AST] | * | * n | * L[AST] | L[AST] ]`

The buffer does not include a history of the EDB\*Plus commands.

`n`

> n represents the buffer line number.

`n m`

> n m displays a list of lines between n and m.

`n *`

> n \* displays a list of lines that range between line n and the current line.

`n L[AST]`

> n L\[AST\] displays a list of lines that range from line n through the last line in the buffer.

`*`

> `*` displays the current line.

`* n`

> `* n` displays a list of lines that range from the current line through line n.

`* L[AST]`

> `* L[AST]` displays a list of lines that range from the current line through the last line.

`L[AST]`

> L\[AST\] displays the last line.

## PASSWORD



Use the PASSWORD command to change your database password.

`PASSW[ORD] [<user_name>]`

You must have sufficient privileges to use the PASSWORD command to change another user's password. The following example demonstrates using the PASSWORD command to change the password for a user named `acctg`:

    SQL> PASSWORD acctg
    Changing password for acctg
    New password:
    New password again:
    Password successfully changed.

## PAUSE



The PAUSE command displays a message, and waits for the user to press ENTER.

`PAU[SE] [<optional_text>]`

`optional_text` specifies the text that will be displayed to the user. If the `optional_text` is omitted, Advanced Server will display two blank lines. If you double quote the `optional_text` string, the quotes will be included in the output.

## PROMPT



The PROMPT command displays a message to the user before continuing.

`PRO[MPT] [<message_text>]`

`message_text` specifies the text displayed to the user. Double quote the string to include quotes in the output.

## QUIT



The QUIT command terminates the session and returns control to the operating system. QUIT is a synonym for EXIT.

    QUIT
    [SUCCESS | FAILURE | WARNING | value> | <sub_variable>]
    [COMMIT | ROLLBACK]``

The default value is QUIT SUCCESS COMMIT.

## REMARK



Use REMARK to include comments in a script.

> `REM[ARK] [<optional_text>]`

You may also use the following convention to include a comment:

    *
    * This is an example of a three line comment.
    *

## SAVE



Use the SAVE command to write the SQL Buffer to an operating system file.

    SAV[E] <file_name> [CRE[ATE] | REP[LACE] | APP[END]]

`file_name`

> `file_name` specifies the name of the file (including the path) where the buffer contents are written. If you do not provide a file extension, .sql is appended to the end of the file name.

`CREATE`

> Include the CREATE keyword to create a new file. A new file is created *only* if a file with the specified name does not already exist. This is the default.

`REPLACE`

> Include the REPLACE keyword to specify that Advanced Server should overwrite an existing file.

`APPEND`

> Include the APPEND keyword to specify that Advanced Server should append the contents of the SQL buffer to the end of the specified file.

The following example saves the contents of the SQL buffer to a file named`example.sql`, located in the temp directory:

SQL&gt; SAVE C:example.sql CREATE File "example.sql" written.

## SET



Use the SET command to specify a value for a session level variable that controls EDB\*Plus behavior. The following forms of the SET command are valid:

**SET AUTOCOMMIT**

Use the SET AUTOCOMMIT command to specify commit behavior for Advanced Server transactions.

`SET AUTO[COMMIT] {ON | OFF | IMMEDIATE | <statement_count>}`

Please note that EDB\*Plus always automatically commits DDL statements.

`ON`

> Specify ON to turn autocommit behavior on.

`OFF`

> Specify OFF to turn autocommit behavior off.

`IMMEDIATE`

> IMMEDIATE has the same effect as ON.

`statement_count`

> Include a value for `statement_count` to instruct EDB\*Plus to issue a commit after the specified count of successful SQL statements.

**SET COLUMN SEPARATOR**

Use the SET COLUMN SEPARATOR command to specify the text that Advanced Server displays between columns.

`SET COLSEP <column_separator>`

The default value of `column_separator` is a single space.

**SET ECHO**

Use the SET ECHO command to specify if SQL and EDB\*Plus script statements should be displayed onscreen as they are executed.

`SET ECHO {ON | OFF}`

The default value is OFF.

**SET FEEDBACK**

The SET FEEDBACK command controls the display of interactive information after a SQL statement executes.

`SET FEED[BACK] {ON | OFF | row_threshold}`

`row_threshold`

> Specify an integer value for `row_threshold`. Setting `row_threshold` to 0 is same as setting FEEDBACK to OFF. Setting `row_threshold` equal 1 effectively sets FEEDBACK to ON.

**SET FLUSH**

Use the SET FLUSH command to control display buffering.

`SET FLU[SH] {ON | OFF}`

Set FLUSH to OFF to enable display buffering. If you enable buffering, messages bound for the screen may not appear until the script completes. Please note that setting FLUSH to OFF will offer better performance.

Set FLUSH to ON to disable display buffering. If you disable buffering, messages bound for the screen appear immediately.

**SET HEADING**

Use the SET HEADING variable to specify if Advanced Server should display column headings for SELECT statements.

`SET HEA[DING] {ON | OFF}`

**SET HEAD SEPARATOR**

The SET HEADSEP command sets the new heading separator character used by the COLUMN HEADING command. The default is '\|'.

`SET HEADS[EP]`

**SET LINESIZE**

Use the SET LINESIZE command to specify the width of a line in characters.

`SET LIN[ESIZE] <width_of_line>`

*width\_of\_line*

> The default value of *width\_of\_line* is 132.

**SET NEWPAGE**

Use the SET NEWPAGE command to specify how many blank lines are printed after a page break.

> `SET NEWP[AGE] <lines_per_page>`

`lines_per_page`

The default value of `lines_per_page` is 1.

**SET NULL**

Use the SET NULL command to specify a string that is displayed to the user when a NULL column value is displayed in the output buffer.

`SET NULL <null_string>`

**SET PAGESIZE**

Use the SET PAGESIZE command to specify the number of printed lines that fit on a page.

`SET PAGES[IZE] <line_count>`

Use the line\_count parameter to specify the number of lines per page.

**SET SQLCASE**

The SET SQLCASE command specifies if SQL statements transmitted to the server should be converted to upper or lower case.

`SET SQLC[ASE] {MIX[ED] | UP[PER] | LO[WER]}`

UPPER

> Specify UPPER to convert the command text to uppercase.

LOWER

> Specify LOWER to convert the command text to lowercase.

MIXED

> Specify MIXED to leave the case of SQL commands unchanged. The default is MIXED.

**SET PAUSE**

The SET PAUSE command is most useful when included in a script; the command displays a prompt and waits for the user to press Return.

`SET PAU[SE] {ON | OFF}`

If SET PAUSE is ON, the message Hit ENTER to continue… will be displayed before each command is executed.

**SET SPACE**

Use the SET SPACE command to specify the number of spaces to display between columns:

`SET SPACE <number_of_spaces>`

**SET SQLPROMPT**

Use SET SQLPROMPT to set a value for a user-interactive prompt:

`SET SQLP[ROMPT] "<prompt>"`

By default, SQLPROMPT is set to "SQL&gt; "

**SET TERMOUT**

Use the SET TERMOUT command to specify if command output should be displayed onscreen.

`SET TERM[OUT] {ON | OFF}`

**SET TIMING**

The SET TIMING command specifies if Advanced Server should display the execution time for each SQL statement after it is executed.

`SET TIMI[NG] {ON | OFF}`

**SET TRIMSPOOL**

Use the SET TRIMSPOOL command to remove trailing spaces from each line in the output file specified by the SPOOL command.

`SET TRIMS[POOL] {ON | OFF}`

The default value is OFF.

**SET VERIFY**

Specifies if both the old and new values of a SQL statement are displayed when a substitution variable is encountered.

`SET VER[IFY] { ON | OFF }`

## SHOW



Use the SHOW command to display current parameter values.

> `SHO[W] {ALL |`parameter\_name`}`

Display the current parameter settings by including the ALL keyword:

    SQL> SHOW ALL
    autocommit OFF
    colsep " "
    define "&"
    echo OFF
    FEEDBACK ON for 6 row(s).
    flush ON
    heading ON
    headsep "|"
    linesize 78
    newpage 1
    null " "
    pagesize 14
    pause OFF
    serveroutput OFF
    spool OFF
    sqlcase MIXED
    sqlprompt "SQL> "
    sqlterminator ";"
    suffix ".sql"
    termout ON
    timing OFF
    verify ON
    USER is "enterprisedb"
    HOST is "localhost"
    PORT is "5444"
    DATABASE is "edb"
    VERSION is "10.0.0"

Or display a specific parameter setting by including the parameter\_name in the SHOW command:

    SQL> SHOW VERSION
    VERSION is "10.0.0"

## SPOOL



The SPOOL command sends output from the display to a file.

> `SP[OOL] <output_file> | OFF`

Use the `output_file` parameter to specify a path name for the output file.

## START



Use the START command to run an EDB\*Plus script file; START is an alias for @ command.

> `STA[RT] <script_file>`

Specify the name of a script file in the `script_file` parameter.

## UNDEFINE



The UNDEFINE command erases a user variable created by the DEFINE command.

> `UNDEF[INE] <variable_name> [ <variable_name>...]`

Use the `variable_name` parameter to specify the name of a variable or variables.

## WHENEVER SQLERROR



The WHENEVER SQLERROR command provides error handling for SQL errors or PL/SQL block errors. The syntax is:

    WHENEVER SQLERROR
    {CONTINUE[COMMIT|ROLLBACK|NONE]
