Use the `START_QUEUE` procedure to make a queue available for enqueuing and dequeueing. The signature is:

```text
START_QUEUE(
  <queue_name> IN VARCHAR2,
  <enqueue> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  <dequeue> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE)
```

**Parameters**

`queue_name`

 `queue_name` specifies the name of the queue that you are starting.

`enqueue`

 Specify `TRUE` to enable enqueueing (the default), or `FALSE` to leave the current setting unchanged.

`dequeue`

 Specify `TRUE` to enable dequeueing (the default), or `FALSE` to leave the current setting unchanged.

**Example**

The following anonymous block makes a queue named `work_order` available for enqueueing:

```text
BEGIN
DBMS_AQADM.START_QUEUE
(queue_name => 'work_order);
END;
```
