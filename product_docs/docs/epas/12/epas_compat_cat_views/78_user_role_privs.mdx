The `USER_ROLE_PRIVS` view provides information about the privileges that have been granted to the current user. A row is created for each role to which a user has been granted.

| -------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `username`     | `TEXT`                 | The name of the user to which the role was granted.                  |
| `granted_role` | `TEXT`                 | Name of the role granted to the grantee.                             |
| `admin_option` | `TEXT`                 | `YES` if the role was granted with the admin option, `NO` otherwise. |
| `default_role` | `TEXT`                 | `YES` if the role is enabled when the grantee creates a session.     |
