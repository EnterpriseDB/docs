title: "Performing a Minor Version Update of an RPM Installation"
---



If you used an RPM package to install Advanced Server or its supporting components, you can use `yum` to perform a minor version upgrade to a more recent version. To review a list of the package updates that are available for your system, open a command line, assume root privileges, and enter the command:

> `yum check-update <package_name>`

Where `<package_name>` is the search term for which you wish to search for updates. Please note that you can include wild-card values in the search term. To use `yum update` to install an updated package, use the command:

> `yum update <package_name>`

Where `<package_name>` is the name of the package you wish to update. Include wild-card values in the update command to update multiple related packages with a single command. For example, use the following command to update all packages whose names include the expression `edb`:

> `yum update edb*`

The `yum update` command will only perform an update between minor releases; to update between major releases, you must use `pg_upgrade`.
