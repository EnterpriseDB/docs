<div id="drop_queue" class="registered_link"></div>

Advanced Server includes extra syntax (not offered by Oracle) with the `DROP QUEUE SQL` command. This syntax can be used in association with `DBMS_AQADM`.

**Name**

`DROP QUEUE` -- drop an existing queue.

**Synopsis**

Use `DROP QUEUE` to drop an existing queue:

```text
DROP QUEUE [IF EXISTS] <name>
```

**Description**

`DROP QUEUE` allows a superuser or a user with the `aq_administrator_role` privilege to drop an existing queue.

**Parameters**

`name`

 The name (possibly schema-qualified) of the queue that is being dropped.

`IF EXISTS`

 Include the `IF EXISTS` clause to instruct the server to not return an error if the queue does not exist. The server will issue a notice.

**Examples**

The following example drops a queue named `work_order`:

```text
DROP QUEUE work_order;
```
