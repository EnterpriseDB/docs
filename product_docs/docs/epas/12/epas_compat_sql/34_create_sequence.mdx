**Name**

`CREATE SEQUENCE` -- define a new sequence generator.

**Synopsis**

```text
CREATE SEQUENCE <name> [ INCREMENT BY <increment> ]
  [ { NOMINVALUE | MINVALUE <minvalue> } ]
  [ { NOMAXVALUE | MAXVALUE <maxvalue> } ]
  [ START WITH <start> ] [ CACHE <cache> | NOCACHE ] [ CYCLE ]
```

**Description**

`CREATE SEQUENCE` creates a new sequence number generator. This involves creating and initializing a new special single-row table with the name, `name`. The generator will be owned by the user issuing the command.

If a schema name is given then the sequence is created in the specified schema, otherwise it is created in the current schema. The sequence name must be distinct from the name of any other sequence, table, index, or view in the same schema.

After a sequence is created, use the functions `NEXTVAL` and `CURRVAL` to operate on the sequence. These functions are documented in Sequence Manipulation Functions of *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Reference Guide*.

**Parameters**

`name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the sequence to be created.

`increment`

 The optional clause `INCREMENT BY increment` specifies the value to add to the current sequence value to create a new value. A positive value will make an ascending sequence, a negative one a descending sequence. The default value is `1`.

`NOMINVALUE | MINVALUE minvalue`

 The optional clause `MINVALUE minvalue` determines the minimum value a sequence can generate. If this clause is not supplied, then defaults will be used. The defaults are 1 and -2<sup>63</sup>-1 for ascending and descending sequences, respectively. Note that the key words, `NOMINVALUE`, may be used to set this behavior to the default.

`NOMAXVALUE | MAXVALUE maxvalue`

 The optional clause `MAXVALUE maxvalue` determines the maximum value for the sequence. If this clause is not supplied, then default values will be used. The defaults are 2<sup>63</sup>-1 and -1 for ascending and descending sequences, respectively. Note that the key words, `NOMAXVALUE`, may be used to set this behavior to the default.

`start`

 The optional clause `START WITH start` allows the sequence to begin anywhere. The default starting value is `minvalue` for ascending sequences and `maxvalue` for descending ones.

`cache`

 The optional clause `CACHE cache` specifies how many sequence numbers are to be preallocated and stored in memory for faster access. The minimum value is `1` (only one value can be generated at a time, i.e., `NOCACHE`), and this is also the default.

`CYCLE`

 The `CYCLE` option allows the sequence to wrap around when the `maxvalue` or `minvalue` has been reached by an ascending or descending sequence respectively. If the limit is reached, the next number generated will be the `minvalue` or `maxvalue`, respectively.

 If `CYCLE` is omitted (the default), any calls to `NEXTVAL` after the sequence has reached its maximum value will return an error. Note that the key words, `NO CYCLE`, may be used to obtain the default behavior, however, this term is not compatible with Oracle databases.

**Notes**

Sequences are based on big integer arithmetic, so the range cannot exceed the range of an eight-byte integer (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807). On some older platforms, there may be no compiler support for eight-byte integers, in which case sequences use regular `INTEGER` arithmetic (range -2147483648 to +2147483647).

Unexpected results may be obtained if a `cache` setting greater than one is used for a sequence object that will be used concurrently by multiple sessions. Each session will allocate and cache successive sequence values during one access to the sequence object and increase the sequence object’s last value accordingly. Then, the next `cache-1` uses of `NEXTVAL` within that session simply return the preallocated values without touching the sequence object. So, any numbers allocated but not used within a session will be lost when that session ends, resulting in "holes" in the sequence.

Furthermore, although multiple sessions are guaranteed to allocate distinct sequence values, the values may be generated out of sequence when all the sessions are considered. For example, with a `cache` setting of 10, session A might reserve values 1..10 and return `NEXTVAL=1`, then session B might reserve values 11..20 and return `NEXTVAL=11` before session A has generated `NEXTVAL=2`. Thus, with a `cache` setting of one it is safe to assume that `NEXTVAL` values are generated sequentially; with a `cache` setting greater than one you should only assume that the `NEXTVAL` values are all distinct, not that they are generated purely sequentially. Also, the last value will reflect the latest value reserved by any session, whether or not it has yet been returned by `NEXTVAL`.

**Examples**

Create an ascending sequence called `serial`, starting at 101:

```text
CREATE SEQUENCE serial START WITH 101;
```

Select the next number from this sequence:

```text
SELECT serial.NEXTVAL FROM DUAL;

 nextval
---------
     101
(1 row)
```

Create a sequence called `supplier_seq` with the `NOCACHE` option:

```text
CREATE SEQUENCE supplier_seq
    MINVALUE 1
    START WITH 1
    INCREMENT BY 1
    NOCACHE;
```

Select the next number from this sequence:

```text
SELECT supplier_seq.NEXTVAL FROM DUAL;

 nextval
---------
       1
(1 row)
```
