<div id="alter_queue" class="registered_link"></div>

Advanced Server includes extra syntax (not offered by Oracle) with the `ALTER QUEUE SQL` command. This syntax can be used in association with the `DBMS_AQADM` package.

**Name**

`ALTER QUEUE` -- allows a superuser or a user with the `aq_administrator_role` privilege to modify the attributes of a queue.

**Synopsis**

This command is available in four forms. The first form of this command changes the name of a queue.

```text
ALTER QUEUE <queue_name> RENAME TO <new_name>
```

**Parameters**

`queue_name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing queue.

`RENAME TO`

 Include the `RENAME TO` clause and a new name for the queue to rename the queue.

`new_name`

 New name for the queue.

The second form of the `ALTER QUEUE` command modifies the attributes of the queue:

```text
ALTER QUEUE <queue_name> SET [ ( { <option_name option_value>  ) } [,SET <option_name> ] ]
```

**Parameters**

`queue_name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing queue.

 Include the `SET` clause and `option_name/option_value` pairs to modify the attributes of the queue:

`option_name option_value`

 The name of the option or options to be associated with the new queue and the corresponding value of the option. If you provide duplicate option names, the server will return an error.

-   If `option_name` is `retries`, provide an integer that represents the number of times a dequeue may be attempted.
-   If `option_name` is `retrydelay`, provide a double-precision value that represents the delay in seconds.
-   If `option_name` is `retention`, provide a double-precision value that represents the retention time in seconds.

Use the third form of the `ALTER QUEUE` command to enable or disable enqueuing and/or dequeuing on a particular queue:

```text
ALTER QUEUE <queue_name> ACCESS { START | STOP } [ FOR { enqueue | dequeue } ] [ NOWAIT ]
```

**Parameters**

`queue_name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing queue.

`ACCESS`

 Include the `ACCESS` keyword to enable or disable enqueuing and/or dequeuing on a particular queue.

`START | STOP`

 Use the `START` and `STOP` keywords to indicate the desired state of the queue.

`FOR enqueue|dequeue`

 Use the `FOR` clause to indicate if you are specifying the state of enqueueing or dequeueing activity on the specified queue.

`NOWAIT`

 Include the `NOWAIT` keyword to specify that the server should not wait for the completion of outstanding transactions before changing the state of the queue. The `NOWAIT` keyword can only be used when specifying an `ACCESS` value of `STOP`. The server will return an error if `NOWAIT` is specified with an `ACCESS` value of `START`.

Use the fourth form to `ADD` or `DROP` callback details for a particular queue.

```text
ALTER QUEUE <queue_name> { ADD | DROP } CALL TO <location_name> [ WITH <callback_option> ]
```

**Parameters**

`queue_name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing queue.

`ADD | DROP`

 Include the `ADD` or `DROP` keywords to enable add or remove callback details for a queue.

`location_name`

 `location_name` specifies the name of the callback procedure.

`callback_option`

 `callback_option` can be `context`; specify a `RAW` value when including this clause.

**Examples**

The following example changes the name of a queue from `work_queue_east` to `work_order`:

```text
ALTER QUEUE work_queue_east RENAME TO work_order;
```

The following example modifies a queue named `work_order`, setting the number of retries to `100`, the delay between retries to `2` seconds, and the length of time that the queue will retain dequeued messages to `10` seconds:

```text
ALTER QUEUE work_order SET (retries 100, retrydelay 2, retention 10);
```

The following commands enable enqueueing and dequeueing in a queue named `work_order`:

```text
ALTER QUEUE work_order ACCESS START;
ALTER QUEUE work_order ACCESS START FOR enqueue;
ALTER QUEUE work_order ACCESS START FOR dequeue;
```

The following commands disable enqueueing and dequeueing in a queue named `work_order`:

```text
ALTER QUEUE work_order ACCESS STOP NOWAIT;
ALTER QUEUE work_order ACCESS STOP FOR enqueue;
ALTER QUEUE work_order ACCESS STOP FOR dequeue;
```
