**Name**

`UPDATE` -- update rows of a table.

**Synopsis**

```text
UPDATE [ <optimizer_hint> ] <table>[@<dblink> ]
    SET <column> = { <expression> | DEFAULT } [, ...]
  [ WHERE <condition> ]
  [ RETURNING <return_expression> [, ...]
      { INTO { <record> | <variable> [, ...] }
      | BULK COLLECT INTO <collection> [, ...] } ]
```

**Description**

`UPDATE` changes the values of the specified columns in all rows that satisfy the condition. Only the columns to be modified need be mentioned in the SET clause; columns not explicitly modified retain their previous values.

The `RETURNING INTO { record | variable [, ...] }` clause may only be specified within an SPL program. In addition the result set of the `UPDATE` command must not return more than one row, otherwise an exception is thrown. If the result set is empty, then the contents of the target record or variables are set to null.

The `RETURNING BULK COLLECT INTO collection [, ...]` clause may only be specified if the `UPDATE` command is used within an SPL program. If more than one `collection` is specified as the target of the `BULK COLLECT INTO` clause, then each `collection` must consist of a single, scalar field – i.e., `collection` must not be a record. The result set of the `UPDATE` command may contain none, one, or more rows. `return_expression` evaluated for each row of the result set, becomes an element in `collection` starting with the first element. Any existing rows in `collection` are deleted. If the result set is empty, then `collection` will be empty.

You must have the `UPDATE` privilege on the table to update it, as well as the `SELECT` privilege to any table whose values are read in `expression` or `condition`.

**Parameters**

`optimizer_hint`

 Comment-embedded hints to the optimizer for selection of an execution plan.

`table`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table to update.

`dblink`

 Database link name identifying a remote database. See the `CREATE DATABASE LINK` command for information on database links.

`column`

 The name of a column in table.

`expression`

 An expression to assign to the column. The expression may use the old values of this and other columns in the table.

`DEFAULT`

 Set the column to its default value (which will be null if no specific default expression has been assigned to it).

`condition`

 An expression that returns a value of type `BOOLEAN`. Only rows for which this expression returns true will be updated.

`return_expression`

 An expression that may include one or more columns from table. If a column name from table is specified in `return_expression`, the value substituted for the column when `return_expression` is evaluated is determined as follows:

-   If the column specified in `return_expression` is assigned a value in the `UPDATE` command, then the assigned value is used in the evaluation of `return_expression`.

-   If the column specified in `return_expression` is not assigned a value in the `UPDATE` command, then the column’s current value in the affected row is used in the evaluation of `return_expression`.

`record`

 A record whose field the evaluated `return_expression` is to be assigned. The first `return_expression` is assigned to the first field in `record`, the second `return_expression` is assigned to the second field in `record`, etc. The number of fields in `record` must exactly match the number of expressions and the fields must be type-compatible with their assigned expressions.

`variable`

 A variable to which the evaluated `return_expression` is to be assigned. If more than one `return_expression` and `variable` are specified, the first `return_expression` is assigned to the first `variable`, the second `return_expression` is assigned to the second `variable`, etc. The number of variables specified following the `INTO` keyword must exactly match the number of expressions following the `RETURNING` keyword and the variables must be type-compatible with their assigned expressions.

`collection`

 A collection in which an element is created from the evaluated `return_expression`. There can be either a single collection which may be a collection of a single field or a collection of a record type, or there may be more than one collection in which case each collection must consist of a single field. The number of return expressions must match in number and order the number of fields in all specified collections. Each corresponding `return_expression` and `collection` field must be type-compatible.

**Examples**

Change the location to `AUSTIN` for department `20` in the `dept` table:

```text
UPDATE dept SET loc = 'AUSTIN' WHERE deptno = 20;
```

For all employees with `job = SALESMAN` in the `emp` table, update the salary by `10%` and increase the commission by `500`.

```text
UPDATE emp SET sal = sal * 1.1, comm = comm + 500 WHERE job = 'SALESMAN';
```
