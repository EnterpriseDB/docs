**Name**

`CREATE DIRECTORY` -- create an alias for a file system directory path.

**Synopsis**

```text
CREATE DIRECTORY <name> AS '<pathname>'
```

**Description**

The `CREATE DIRECTORY` command creates an alias for a file system directory pathname. You must be a database superuser to use this command.

When the alias is specified as the appropriate parameter to the programs of the `UTL_FILE` package, the operating system files are created in, or accessed from the directory corresponding to the given alias.

**Parameters**

`name`

 The directory alias name.

`pathname`

 The fully-qualified directory path represented by the alias name. The `CREATE DIRECTORY` command does not create the operating system directory. The physical directory must be created independently using the appropriate operating system commands.

**Notes**

The operating system user id, `enterprisedb`, must have the appropriate read and/or write privileges on the directory if the `UTL_FILE` package is to be used to create and/or read files using the directory.

The directory alias is stored in the `pg_catalog.edb_dir` system catalog table. Note that `edb_dir` is not a table compatible with Oracle databases.

The directory alias can also be viewed from the Oracle catalog views `SYS.ALL_DIRECTORIES` and `SYS.DBA_DIRECTORIES`, which are compatible with Oracle databases.

Use the `DROP DIRECTORY` command to delete the directory alias. When a directory alias is deleted, the corresponding physical file system directory is not affected. The file system directory must be deleted using the appropriate operating system commands.

In a Linux system, the directory name separator is a forward slash `(/)`.

In a Windows system, the directory name separator can be specified as a forward slash `(/)` or two consecutive backslashes `(\\)`.

**Examples**

Create an alias named `empdir` for directory `/tmp/empdir` on Linux:

```text
CREATE DIRECTORY empdir AS '/tmp/empdir';
```

Create an alias named `empdir` for directory `C:\TEMP\EMPDIR` on Windows:

```text
CREATE DIRECTORY empdir AS 'C:/TEMP/EMPDIR';
```

View all of the directory aliases:

```text
SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.edb_dir;

dirname | dirowner |    dirpath     | diracl
--------+----------+----------------+--------
 empdir |       10 | C:/TEMP/EMPDIR |
(1 row)
```

View the directory aliases using a view compatible with Oracle databases:

```text
SELECT * FROM SYS.ALL_DIRECTORIES;

    owner     | directory_name | directory_path
--------------+----------------+----------------
 ENTERPRISEDB | EMPDIR         | C:/TEMP/EMPDIR
(1 row)
```
