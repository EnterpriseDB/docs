**Name**

`DROP PROCEDURE` -- remove a procedure.

**Synopsis**

```text
DROP PROCEDURE [ IF EXISTS ] <name>
  [ ([ [ <argmode> ] [ <argname> ] <argtype> ] [, ...]) ]
  [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ]
```

**Description**

`DROP PROCEDURE` removes the definition of an existing procedure. To execute this command you must be a superuser or the owner of the procedure. All input (`IN`, `IN OUT`) argument data types to the procedure must be specified if this is an overloaded procedure. (This requirement is not compatible with Oracle databases. In Oracle, only the procedure name is specified. Advanced Server allows overloading of procedure names, so the procedure signature given by the input argument data types is required in the Advanced Server `DROP PROCEDURE` command of an overloaded procedure.)

Usage of `IF EXISTS`, `CASCADE`, or `RESTRICT` is not compatible with Oracle databases and is used only by Advanced Server.

**Parameters**

`IF EXISTS`

 Do not throw an error if the procedure does not exist. A notice is issued in this case.

`name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing procedure.

`argmode`

 The mode of an argument: `IN`, `IN OUT`, or `OUT`. If omitted, the default is `IN`. Note that `DROP PROCEDURE` does not actually pay any attention to `OUT` arguments, since only the input arguments are needed to determine the procedure’s identity. So it is sufficient to list only the `IN` and `IN OUT` arguments. (Specification of `argmode` is not compatible with Oracle databases and applies only to Advanced Server.)

`argname`

 The name of an argument. Note that `DROP PROCEDURE` does not actually pay any attention to argument names, since only the argument data types are needed to determine the procedure’s identity. (Specification of `argname` is not compatible with Oracle databases and applies only to Advanced Server.)

`argtype`

 The data type of an argument of the procedure. (Specification of `argtype` is not compatible with Oracle databases and applies only to Advanced Server.)

`CASCADE`

 Automatically drop objects that depend on the procedure, and in turn all objects that depend on those objects.

`RESTRICT`

 Refuse to drop the procedure if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

**Examples**

The following command removes the `select_emp` procedure.

```text
DROP PROCEDURE select_emp;
```
