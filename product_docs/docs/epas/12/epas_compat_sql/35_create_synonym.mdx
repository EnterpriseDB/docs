<div id="create_synonym" class="registered_link"></div>

**Name**

`CREATE SYNONYM` -- define a new synonym.

**Synopsis**

```text
CREATE [OR REPLACE] [PUBLIC] SYNONYM [<schema>.]<syn_name>
        FOR <object_schema>.<object_name>[@<dblink_name>];
```

**Description**

`CREATE SYNONYM` defines a synonym for certain types of database objects. Advanced Server supports synonyms for:

-   tables
-   views
-   materialized views
-   sequences
-   stored procedures
-   stored functions
-   types
-   objects that are accessible through a database link
-   other synonyms

**Parameters**

`syn_name`

 `syn_name` is the name of the synonym. A synonym name must be unique within a schema.

`schema`

 `schema` specifies the name of the schema that the synonym resides in. If you do not specify a schema name, the synonym is created in the first existing schema in your search path.

`object_name`

 `object_name` specifies the name of the object.

`object_schema`

 `object_schema` specifies the name of the schema that the referenced object resides in.

`dblink_name`

 `dblink_name` specifies the name of the database link through which an object is accessed.

Include the `REPLACE` clause to replace an existing synonym definition with a new synonym definition.

Include the `PUBLIC` clause to create the synonym in the `public` schema. The `CREATE PUBLIC SYNONYM` command, compatible with Oracle databases, creates a synonym that resides in the `public` schema:

```text
CREATE [OR REPLACE] PUBLIC SYNONYM <syn_name> FOR
<object_schema>.<object_name>;
```

This just a shorthand way to write:

```text
CREATE [OR REPLACE] SYNONYM public.<syn_name> FOR
<object_schema>.<object_name>;
```

**Notes**

Access to the object referenced by the synonym is determined by the permissions of the current user of the synonym; the synonym user must have the appropriate permissions on the underlying database object.

**Examples**

Create a synonym for the `emp` table in a schema named, `enterprisedb`:

```text
CREATE SYNONYM personnel FOR enterprisedb.emp;
```
