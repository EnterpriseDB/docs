**Name**

`CREATE TABLE AS` -- define a new table from the results of a query.

**Synopsis**

```text
CREATE [ GLOBAL TEMPORARY ] TABLE <table_name>
  [ (<column_name> [, ...] ) ]
  [ ON COMMIT { PRESERVE ROWS | DELETE ROWS } ]
  [ TABLESPACE tablespace ]
  AS <query>
```

**Description**

`CREATE TABLE AS` creates a table and fills it with data computed by a `SELECT` command. The table columns have the names and data types associated with the output columns of the `SELECT` (except that you can override the column names by giving an explicit list of new column names).

`CREATE TABLE AS` bears some resemblance to creating a view, but it is really quite different: it creates a new table and evaluates the query just once to fill the new table initially. The new table will not track subsequent changes to the source tables of the query. In contrast, a view re-evaluates its defining `SELECT` statement whenever it is queried.

**Parameters**

`GLOBAL TEMPORARY`

 If specified, the table is created as a temporary table. Refer to `CREATE TABLE` for details.

`table_name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table to be created.

`column_name`

 The name of a column in the new table. If column names are not provided, they are taken from the output column names of the query.

`query`

 A query statement ( a `SELECT` command). Refer to `SELECT` for a description of the allowed syntax.
