title: "The ROWNUM Pseudo-Column"
---

<div id="the_rownum_pseudo_column" class="registered_link"></div>


`ROWNUM` is a pseudo-column that is assigned an incremental, unique integer value for each row based on the order the rows were retrieved from a query. Therefore, the first row retrieved will have `ROWNUM` of `1`; the second row will have `ROWNUM` of `2` and so on.

This feature can be used to limit the number of rows retrieved by a query. This is demonstrated in the following example:

    SELECT empno, ename, job FROM emp WHERE ROWNUM < 5;

     empno | ename |   job
    -------+-------+----------
     7369  | SMITH | CLERK
     7499  | ALLEN | SALESMAN
     7521  | WARD  | SALESMAN
     7566  | JONES | MANAGER
    (4 rows)

The `ROWNUM` value is assigned to each row before any sorting of the result set takes place. Thus, the result set is returned in the order given by the `ORDER BY` clause, but the `ROWNUM` values may not necessarily be in ascending order as shown in the following example:

    SELECT ROWNUM, empno, ename, job FROM emp WHERE ROWNUM < 5 ORDER BY ename;

     rownum | empno | ename |   job
    --------+-------+-------+----------
          2 |  7499 | ALLEN | SALESMAN
          4 |  7566 | JONES | MANAGER
          1 |  7369 | SMITH | CLERK
          3 |  7521 | WARD  | SALESMAN
    (4 rows)

The following example shows how a sequence number can be added to every row in the `jobhist` table. First a new column named, `seqno`, is added to the table and then `seqno` is set to `ROWNUM` in the `UPDATE` command.

    ALTER TABLE jobhist ADD seqno NUMBER(3);
    UPDATE jobhist SET seqno = ROWNUM;

The following `SELECT` command shows the new `seqno` values.

    SELECT seqno, empno, TO_CHAR(startdate,'DD-MON-YY') AS start, job FROM
    jobhist;

    seqno  | empno |   start   |    job
