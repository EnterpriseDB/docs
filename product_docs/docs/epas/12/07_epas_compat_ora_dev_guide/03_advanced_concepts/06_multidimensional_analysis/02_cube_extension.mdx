<div id="cube_extension" class="registered_link"></div>


The `CUBE` extension is similar to the `ROLLUP` extension. However, unlike `ROLLUP`, which produces groupings and results in a hierarchy based on a left to right listing of items in the `ROLLUP` expression list, a `CUBE` produces groupings and subtotals based on every permutation of all items in the `CUBE` expression list. Thus, the result set contains more rows than a `ROLLUP` performed on the same expression list.

The syntax for a single `CUBE` is as follows:

    CUBE ( { <expr_1> | ( <expr_1a> [, <expr_1b> ] ...) }
      [, <expr_2> | ( <expr_2a> [, <expr_2b> ] ...) ] ...)

Each `expr` is an expression that determines the grouping of the result set. If enclosed within parenthesis as `( expr_1a, expr_1b, ...)` then the combination of values returned by `expr_1a` and `expr_1b` defines a single group.

The base level of aggregates returned in the result set is for each unique combination of values returned by the expression list.

In addition, a subtotal is returned for the first item in the list (`expr_1` or the combination of `( expr_1a, expr_1b, ...)`, whichever is specified) for each unique value. A subtotal is returned for the second item in the list (`expr_2` or the combination of `( expr_2a, expr_2b, ...)`, whichever is specified) for each unique value. A subtotal is also returned for each unique combination of the first item and the second item. Similarly, if there is a third item, a subtotal is returned for each unique value of the third item, each unique value of the third item and first item combination, each unique value of the third item and second item combination, and each unique value of the third item, second item, and first item combination. Finally a grand total is returned for the entire result set.

For the subtotal rows, null is returned for the items across which the subtotal is taken.

The `CUBE` extension specified within the context of the `GROUP BY` clause is shown by the following:

    SELECT <select_list> FROM ...
    GROUP BY [... ,] CUBE ( <expression_list> ) [, ...]

The items specified in `select_list` must also appear in the `CUBE expression_list`; or they must be aggregate functions such as `COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN`, or `MAX`; or they must be constants or functions whose return values are independent of the individual rows in the group (for example, the `SYSDATE` function).

The `GROUP BY` clause may specify multiple `CUBE` extensions as well as multiple occurrences of other `GROUP BY` extensions and individual expressions.

The `ORDER BY` clause should be used if you want the output to display in a meaningful structure. There is no guarantee on the order of the result set if no `ORDER BY` clause is specified.

The number of grouping levels or totals is `2` raised to the power of *n* where *n* represents the number of items in the `CUBE` expression list. A parenthesized list counts as one item.

The following query produces a cube based on permutations of columns `loc, dname`, and `job`.

    SELECT loc, dname, job, COUNT(*) AS "employees" FROM emp e, dept d
    WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
    GROUP BY CUBE (loc, dname, job)
    ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;

The following is the result of the query. There is a count of the number of employees for each combination of `loc, dname`, and `job`, as well as subtotals for each combination of `loc` and `dname`, for each combination of `loc` and `job`, for each combination of `dname` and `job`, for each unique value of `loc`, for each unique value of `dname`, for each unique value of `job`, and a grand total displayed on the last line.

    loc      |   dname    |    job    | employees

The following query shows the effect of combining items in the `CUBE` list within parenthesis.

    SELECT loc, dname, job, COUNT(*) AS "employees" FROM emp e, dept d
    WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
    GROUP BY CUBE (loc, (dname, job))
    ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;

In the output note that there are no subtotals for permutations involving `loc` and `dname` combinations, `loc` and `job` combinations, or for `dname` by itself, or for `job` by itself.

The following query shows another variation whereby the first expression is specified outside of the `CUBE` extension.

    SELECT loc, dname, job, COUNT(*) AS "employees" FROM emp e, dept d
    WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
    GROUP BY loc, CUBE (dname, job)
    ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;

In this output, the permutations are performed for `dname` and `job` within each grouping of `loc`.
