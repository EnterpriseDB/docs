The column values of existing rows can be changed using the `UPDATE` command. For example, the following sequence of commands shows the before and after results of giving everyone who is a manager a 10% raise:

    SELECT ename, sal FROM emp WHERE job = 'MANAGER';

     ename |   sal
    -------+---------
     JONES | 2975.00
     BLAKE | 2850.00
     CLARK | 2450.00
    (3 rows)

    UPDATE emp SET sal = sal * 1.1 WHERE job = 'MANAGER';

    SELECT ename, sal FROM emp WHERE job = 'MANAGER';

     ename |   sal
    -------+---------
     JONES | 3272.50
     BLAKE | 3135.00
     CLARK | 2695.00
    (3 rows)
