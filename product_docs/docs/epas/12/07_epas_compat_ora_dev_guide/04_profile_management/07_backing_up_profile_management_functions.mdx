A profile may include a `PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION` clause that refers to a user-defined function that specifies the behavior enforced by Advanced Server. Profiles are global objects; they are shared by all of the databases within a cluster. While profiles are global objects, user-defined functions are database objects.

Invoking `pg_dumpall` with the `–g` or `–r` option will create a script that recreates the definition of any existing profiles, but that does not recreate the user-defined functions that are referred to by the `PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION` clause. You should use the `pg_dump` utility to explicitly dump (and later restore) the database in which those functions reside.

The script created by `pg_dump` will contain a command that includes the clause and function name:

    ALTER PROFILE… LIMIT PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION <function_name>

to associate the restored function with the profile with which it was previously associated.

If the `PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION` clause is set to `DEFAULT` or `NULL`, the behavior will be replicated by the script generated by the `pg_dumpall –g` or `pg_dumpall –r` command.
