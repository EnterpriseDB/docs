<div id="unlocking_a_locked_account" class="registered_link"></div>


A database superuser can use clauses of the `ALTER USER|ROLE...` command to lock or unlock a role. The syntax is:

    ALTER USER|ROLE <name>
           ACCOUNT {LOCK|UNLOCK}
           LOCK TIME '<timestamp>'

Include the `ACCOUNT LOCK` clause to lock a role immediately; when locked, a role’s `LOGIN` functionality is disabled. When you specify the `ACCOUNT LOCK` clause without the `LOCK TIME` clause, the state of the role will not change until a superuser uses the `ACCOUNT UNLOCK` clause to unlock the role.

Use the `ACCOUNT UNLOCK` clause to unlock a role.

Use the `LOCK TIME 'timestamp'` clause to instruct the server to lock the account at the time specified by the given timestamp for the length of time specified by the `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` parameter of the profile associated with this role.

Combine the `LOCK TIME 'timestamp'` clause and the `ACCOUNT LOCK` clause to lock an account at a specified time until the account is unlocked by a superuser invoking the `ACCOUNT UNLOCK` clause.

**Parameters**

`name`

> The name of the role that is being locked or unlocked.

`timestamp`

> The date and time at which the role will be locked. When specifying a value for `timestamp`, enclose the value in single-quotes.

This command (available only in Advanced Server) is implemented to support Oracle-styled profile management.

**Examples**

The following example uses the `ACCOUNT LOCK` clause to lock the role named `john`. The account will remain locked until the account is unlocked with the `ACCOUNT UNLOCK` clause:

    ALTER ROLE john ACCOUNT LOCK;

The following example uses the `ACCOUNT UNLOCK` clause to unlock the role named `john`:

    ALTER USER john ACCOUNT UNLOCK;

The following example uses the `LOCK TIME 'timestamp'` clause to lock the role named `john` on September 4, 2015:

    ALTER ROLE john LOCK TIME ‘September 4 12:00:00 2015’;

The role will remain locked for the length of time specified by the `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` parameter.

The following example combines the `LOCK TIME 'timestamp'` clause and the `ACCOUNT LOCK` clause to lock the role named `john` on September 4, 2015:

    ALTER ROLE john LOCK TIME ‘September 4 12:00:00 2015’ ACCOUNT LOCK;

The role will remain locked until a database superuser uses the `ACCOUNT UNLOCK` command to unlock the role.
