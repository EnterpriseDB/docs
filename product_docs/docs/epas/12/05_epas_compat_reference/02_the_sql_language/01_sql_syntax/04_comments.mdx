<div id="comments" class="registered_link"></div>


A comment is an arbitrary sequence of characters beginning with double dashes and extending to the end of the line, e.g.:

> `-- This is a standard SQL comment`

Alternatively, C-style block comments can be used:

    /* multiline comment
    * block
    */

where the comment begins with /\* and extends to the matching occurrence of \*/.
