Use the `ALTER TABLE… SPLIT PARTITION` command to divide a single partition into two partitions and redistribute the partition's contents between the new partitions. The command syntax comes in two forms.

The first form splits a `RANGE` partition into two partitions:

```text
ALTER TABLE <table_name> SPLIT PARTITION <partition_name>
  AT (<range_part_value>)
  INTO
  (
    PARTITION <new_part1>
     [TABLESPACE <tablespace_name>]
    PARTITION <new_part2>
     [TABLESPACE <tablespace_name>]
  );
```

The second form splits a `LIST` partition into two partitions:

```text
ALTER TABLE <table_name> SPLIT PARTITION <partition_name>
  VALUES (<value>[, <value>]...)
  INTO
  (
    PARTITION <new_part1>
     [TABLESPACE <tablespace_name>]
    PARTITION <new_part2>
     [TABLESPACE <tablespace_name>]
  );
```

**Description**

The `ALTER TABLE...SPLIT PARTITION` command adds a partition to an existing `LIST` or `RANGE` partitioned table. Please note that the `ALTER TABLE… SPLIT PARTITION` command cannot add a partition to a `HASH` partitioned table. There is no upper limit to the number of partitions that a table may have.

When you execute an `ALTER TABLE...SPLIT PARTITION` command, Advanced Server creates two new partitions and redistributes the content of the old partition between them (as constrained by the partitioning rules).

Include the `TABLESPACE` clause to specify the tablespace in which a partition will reside. If you do not specify a tablespace, the partition will reside in the default tablespace.

If the table is indexed, the index will be created on the new partition.

To use the `ALTER TABLE... SPLIT PARTITION` command you must be the table owner, or have superuser (or administrative) privileges.

**Parameters**

`table_name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the partitioned table.

`partition_name`

 The name of the partition that is being split.

`new_part1`

 The name of the first new partition to be created. Partition names must be unique amongst all partitions and subpartitions, and must follow the naming conventions for object identifiers.

 `new_part1` will receive the rows that meet the partitioning constraints specified in the `ALTER TABLE… SPLIT PARTITION` command.

`new_part2`

 The name of the second new partition to be created. Partition names must be unique amongst all partitions and subpartitions, and must follow the naming conventions for object identifiers.

 `new_part2` will receive the rows are not directed to `new_part1` by the partitioning constraints specified in the `ALTER TABLE… SPLIT PARTITION` command.

`range_part_value`

 Use `range_part_value` to specify the boundary rules by which to create the new partition. The partitioning rule must contain at least one column of a data type that has two operators (i.e., a greater-than-or-equal to operator, and a less-than operator). Range boundaries are evaluated against a `LESS THAN` clause and are non-inclusive; a date boundary of January 1, 2010 will include only those date values that fall on or before December 31, 2009.

`(value[, value]...)`

 Use `value` to specify a quoted literal value (or comma-delimited list of literal values) by which rows will be distributed into partitions. Each partitioning rule must specify at least one value, but there is no limit placed on the number of values specified within a rule.

 For information about creating a `DEFAULT` or `MAXVALUE` partition, see [Handling Stray Values in a LIST or RANGE Partitioned Table](../../05_handling_stray_values_in_a_list_or_range_partitioned_table/#handling_stray_values_in_a_list_or_range_partitioned_table).

`tablespace_name`

 The name of the tablespace in which the partition or subpartition resides.
