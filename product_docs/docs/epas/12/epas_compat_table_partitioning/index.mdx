In a partitioned table, one logically large table is broken into smaller physical pieces. Partitioning can provide several benefits:

-   Query performance can be improved dramatically in certain situations, particularly when most of the heavily accessed rows of the table are in a single partition or a small number of partitions. Partitioning allows you to omit the partition column from the front of an index, reducing index size and making it more likely that the heavily used parts of the index fits in memory.
-   When a query or update accesses a large percentage of a single partition, performance may improve because the server will perform a sequential scan of the partition instead of using an index and random access reads scattered across the whole table.
-   A bulk load (or unload) can be implemented by adding or removing partitions, if you plan that requirement into the partitioning design. `ALTER TABLE` is far faster than a bulk operation. It also entirely avoids the `VACUUM` overhead caused by a bulk `DELETE`.
-   Seldom-used data can be migrated to less-expensive (or slower) storage media.

Table partitioning is worthwhile only when a table would otherwise be very large. The exact point at which a table will benefit from partitioning depends on the application; a good rule of thumb is that the size of the table should exceed the physical memory of the database server.

This document discusses the aspects of table partitioning compatible with Oracle databases that are supported by Advanced Server.

!!! Note
    This document and particularly the partitioning presented in this chapter do not describe the *declarative partitioning* feature, which has been introduced with PostgreSQL version 10. Note that PostgreSQL declarative partitioning is supported in Advanced Server 10 in addition to the table partitioning compatible with Oracle databases as described in this chapter. For information about declarative partitioning, see the PostgreSQL core documentation available at: <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/static/ddl-partitioning.html>

The PostgreSQL 9.6 `INSERT... ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING/UPDATE` clause (commonly known as `UPSERT`) is not supported on Oracle-styled partitioned tables. If you include the `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING/UPDATE` clause when invoking the INSERT command to add data to a partitioned table, the server will return an error.
