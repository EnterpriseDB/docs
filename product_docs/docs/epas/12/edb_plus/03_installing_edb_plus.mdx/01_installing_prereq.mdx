Before installing EDB\*Plus, you must first install Java (version 1.7 or later). On a Linux system, you can use the `yum` package manager to install Java. Open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

-  On RHEL or CentOS 7:

   ```text
   # yum install java
   ```

-  On RHEL or CentOS 8:

   ```text
   # dnf install java
   ```

If you are using Windows, Java installers and instructions are available online at:

<http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp>


You must also have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

After receiving your repository credentials:

1.  Create the repository configuration file.
2.  Modify the file, providing your user name and password.
3.  Install EDB\*Plus.
