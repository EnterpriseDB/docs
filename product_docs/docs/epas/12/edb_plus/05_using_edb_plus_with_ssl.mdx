An EDB\*Plus connection to the Advanced Server database can be accomplished using secure sockets layer (SSL) connectivity.

Using SSL requires various prerequisite configuration steps performed on the database server involved with the SSL connection as well as creation of the Java truststore and keystore on the host that will run EDB\*Plus.

The Java *truststore* is the file containing the Certificate Authority (CA) certificates with which the Java client (EDB\*Plus) uses to verify the authenticity of the server to which it is initiating an SSL connection.

The Java *keystore* is the file containing private and public keys and their corresponding certificates. The keystore is required for client authentication to the server, which is used for the EDB\*Plus connection.

The following is material to which you can refer to for guidance in setting up the SSL connections:

-   For information on setting up SSL connectivity to the Advanced Server database, see the section about secure TCP connections with SSL in Chapter 18 “Server Setup and Operation” in the PostgreSQL Core Documentation located at:

     <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/12/ssl-tcp.html>

-   For information on JDBC client connectivity using SSL, see the section on configuring the client in Chapter 4 “Using SSL” in The PostgreSQL JDBC Interface located at:

     <https://jdbc.postgresql.org/documentation/head/ssl-client.html>

The following sections provide information for the configuration steps of using SSL.

-   Configuring SSL on Advanced Server
-   Configuring SSL for the EDB\*Plus client
-   Requesting SSL connection to the Advanced Server database

## Configuring SSL on Advanced Server

This section provides an example of configuring SSL on a database server to demonstrate the use of SSL with EDB\*Plus. A self-signed certificate is used for this purpose.

**Step 1:** Create the certificate signing request (CSR).

In the following example the generated certificate signing request file is `server.csr`. The private key is generated as file `server.key`.

```text
$ openssl req -new -nodes -text -out server.csr \
> -keyout server.key -subj "/CN=enterprisedb"
Generating a 2048 bit RSA private key
.............................+++
....................................................................+++
writing new private key to 'server.key'
-----
```

!!! Note
    When creating the certificate, the value specified for the common name field (designated as `CN=enterprisedb` in this example) must be the database user name that is specified when connecting to EDB\*Plus.

In addition, user name maps can be used as defined in the `pg_ident.conf` file to permit more flexibility for the common name and database user name. Steps 8 and 9 describe the use of user name `maps`.

**Step 2:** Generate the self-signed certificate.

The following generates a self-signed certificate to file `server.crt` using the certificate signing request file, `server.csr`, and the private key, `server.key`, as input.

```text
$ openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key \
> -out server.crt
Signature ok
subject=/CN=enterprisedb
Getting Private key
```

**Step 3:** Make a copy of the server certificate (`server.crt`) to be used as the root Certificate Authority (CA) file (`root.crt`).

```text
$ cp server.crt root.crt
```

**Step 4:** Delete the now redundant certificate signing request (`server.csr`).

```text
$ rm -f server.csr
```

**Step 5:** Move or copy the certificate and private key files to the Advanced Server data directory (for example, `/opt/edb/as12/data`).

```text
$ mv root.crt /opt/edb/as12/data
$ mv server.crt /opt/edb/as12/data
$ mv server.key /opt/edb/as12/data
```

**Step 6:** Set the file ownership and permissions on the certificate files and private key file.

Set the ownership to the operating system account that owns the data sub-directory of the database server. Set the permissions so that no other groups or accounts other than the owner can access these files.

```text
$ chown enterprisedb root.crt server.crt server.key
$ chgrp enterprisedb root.crt server.crt server.key
$ chmod 600 root.crt server.crt server.key
$ ls -l
total 152
        .
        .
        .
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 985 Aug 22 11:00 root.crt
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 985 Aug 22 10:59 server.crt
-rw------- 1 enterprisedb enterprisedb 1704 Aug 22 10:58 server.key
```

**Step 7:** In the `postgresql.conf` file, make the following modifications.

```text
ssl = on
ssl_cert_file = 'server.crt'
ssl_key_file = 'server.key'
ssl_ca_file = 'root.crt'
```

**Step 8:** Modify the `pg_hba.conf` file to enable SSL usage on the desired database to which EDB\*Plus is to make the SSL connection.

In the `pg_hba.conf` file, the `hostssl` type indicates the entry is used to validate SSL connection attempts from the client (EDB\*Plus).

The authentication method is set to cert with the option `clientcert=1` in order to require an SSL certificate from the client against which authentication is performed using the common name of the certificate (`enterprisedb` in this example).

The `map=sslusers` option specifies that a mapping named `sslusers` defined in the `pg_ident.conf` file is to be used for authentication. This mapping allows a connection to the database if the common name from the certificate and the database user name attempting the connection match the `SYSTEM-USERNAME/PG-USERNAME` pair listed in the `pg_ident.conf` file.

The following is an example of the settings in the `pg_hba.conf` file if the database `(edb)` must use SSL connections.

```text
# TYPE  DATABASE      USER          ADDRESS                 METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all           all                                   md5
# IPv4 local connections:
hostssl   edb         all  192.168.2.0/24   cert clientcert=1 map=sslusers
```

**Step 9:** The following shows the user name maps in the `pg_ident.conf` file related to the `pg_hba.conf` file by the `map=sslusers` option. These user name maps permit you to specify database user names `edbuser`, `postgres`, or `enterprisedb` when connecting with EDB\*Plus.

```text
# MAPNAME   SYSTEM-USERNAME   PG-USERNAME
 sslusers   enterprisedb      edbuser
 sslusers   enterprisedb      postgres
 sslusers   enterprisedb      enterprisedb
```

**Step 10:** Restart the database server after you have made the changes to the configuration files.

## Configuring SSL for the EDB\*Plus Client

After you have configured SSL on the database server, the following steps provide an example of generating certificate and keystore files for EDB\*Plus (the JDBC client).

**Step 1:** Using files `server.crt` and `server.key` located under the database server data sub-directory, create copies of these files and move them to the host where EDB\*Plus is to be running.

Store these files in the desired directory to contain the trusted certificate and keystore files to be generated in the following steps. The suggested location is to create a `.postgresql` sub-directory under the home user account that will invoke EDB\*Plus. Thus, these files will be under the `~/.postgresql` directory of the user account that will run EDB\*Plus.

For this example, assume file `edb.crt` is a copy of `server.crt` and `edb.key` is a copy of `server.key`.

**Step 2:** Create an additional copy of `edb.crt`.

```text
$ cp edb.crt edb_root.crt
$ ls -l
total 12
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  985   Aug 22 14:17  edb.crt
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  1704  Aug 22 14:18  edb.key
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  985   Aug 22 14:19  edb_root.crt
```

**Step 3:** Create a Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) format of file `edb_root.crt`. The generated DER format of this file is `edb_root.crt.der`. The DER format of the file is required for the `keytool` program used in Step 4.

```text
$ openssl x509 -in edb_root.crt -out edb_root.crt.der -outform der
$ ls -l
total 16
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  985  Aug 22 14:17  edb.crt
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  1704 Aug 22 14:18  edb.key
-rw-r--r-- 1 user user  985  Aug 22 14:19  edb_root.crt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user  686  Aug 22 14:21  edb_root.crt.der
```

**Step 4:** Use the `keytool` program to create a keystore file `(postgresql.keystore)` using `edb_root.crt.der` as the input. This process adds the certificate of the Postgres database server to the keystore file.

!!! Note
    The file name `postgresql.keystore` is recommended so that it can be accessed in its default directory location `~/.postgresql postgresql.keystore`, which is under the home directory of the user account invoking EDB\*Plus. Also note that the file name suffix can be `.jks` instead of `.keystore` (thus, file name `postgresql.jks`). However, in the remainder of these examples, file name `postgresql.keystore` is used.

**For Windows only:** The path is `%APPDATA%\.postgresql\postgresql.keystore`

The `keytool` program can be found under the `bin` subdirectory of the Java Runtime Environment installation.

You will be prompted for a new password. Save this password as it must be specified with the PGSSLCERTPASS environment variable.

```text
$ /usr/java/jdk1.8.0_131/jre/bin/keytool -keystore postgresql.keystore \
> -alias postgresqlstore -import -file edb_root.crt.der
Enter keystore password:

      Signature algorithm name: SHA1withRSA
      Version: 1
Trust this certificate? [no]:  yes

```

**Step 5:** Create a `PKCS #12` format of the keystore file `(postgresql.p12)` using files `edb.crt` and `edb.key` as input.

!!! Note
    The file name `postgresql.p12` is recommended so that it can be accessed in its default directory location `~/.postgresql/postgresql.p12`, which is under the home directory of the user account invoking EDB\*Plus.

**For Windows only:** The path is `%APPDATA%\.postgresql\postgresql.p12`

You will be prompted for a new password. Save this password as it must be specified with the PGSSLKEYPASS environment variable.

```text
$ openssl pkcs12 -export -in edb.crt -inkey edb.key -out postgresql.p12
Enter Export Password:
Verifying - Enter Export Password:
$ ls –l
total 24
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user  985 Aug 24 12:18 edb.crt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 1704 Aug 24 12:18 edb.key
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user  985 Aug 24 12:20 edb_root.crt
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user  686 Aug 24 12:20 edb_root.crt.der
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user  758 Aug 24 12:26 postgresql.keystore
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 2285 Aug 24 12:28 postgresql.p12
```

**Step 6:** If the `postgresql.keystore` and `postgresql.p12` files are not already in the `~/.postgresql` directory, move or copy them to that location.

**For Windows only:** The directory is `%APPDATA%\.postgresql`

**Step 7:** If the default location `~/.postgresql` is not used, then the full path (including the file name) to the `postgresql.keystore` file must be set with the `PGSSLCERT` environment variable, and the full path (including the file name) to file `postgresql.p12` must be set with the `PGSSLKEY` environment variable before invoking EDB\*Plus.

In addition, if the generated file from Step 4 was not named `postgresql.keystore` or `postgresql.jks` then, use the `PGSSLCERT` environment variable to designate the file name and its location. Similarly, if the generated file from Step 5 was not named `postgresql.p12` then, use the `PGSSLKEY` environment variable to designate the file name and its location.

## Requesting an SSL Connection between EDB\*Plus and the Advanced Server Database

Be sure the following topics have been addressed in order to perform an SSL connection:

-   The trusted certificate and keystore files have been generated for both the database server and the client host to be invoking EDB\*Plus.
-   The `postgresql.conf` file for the database server contains the updated configuration parameters.
-   The `pg_hba.conf` file for the database server contains the required entry for permitting the SSL connection.
-   For the client host, either the client’s certificate and keystore files have been placed in the user account’s `~/.postgresql` directory or the environment variables `PGSSLCERT` and `PGSSLKEY` are set before invoking EDB\*Plus.
-   The `PGSSLCERTPASS` environment variable is set with a password.
-   The `PGSSLKEYPASS` environment variable is set with a password

When invoking EDB\*Plus, include the `?ssl=true` parameter in the database connection string as shown for the `connectstring` option in [Using EDB\*Plus](04_using_edb_plus/#using_edb_plus).

The following is an example where EDB\*Plus is invoked from a host that is remote to the database server.

The `postgresql.conf` file of the database server contains the following modified parameters:

```text
ssl = on
ssl_cert_file = 'server.crt'
ssl_key_file = 'server.key'
ssl_ca_file = 'root.crt'
```

The `pg_hba.conf` file of the database server contains the following entry for connecting from EDB\*Plus on the remote host:

```text
# TYPE  DATABASE        USER          ADDRESS                 METHOD

# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
local   all             all                                   md5
# IPv4 local connections:
hostssl   edb           all           192.168.2.24/32 cert clientcert=1
```

On the remote host where EDB\*Plus is to be invoked, the Linux user account named `user` contains the certificate and keystore files in its `~/.postgresql` directory:

```text
[user@localhost ~]$ whoami
user
[user@localhost ~]$ cd .postgresql
[user@localhost .postgresql]$ pwd
/home/user/.postgresql
[user@localhost .postgresql]$ ls -l
total 8
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user  758 Aug 24 12:37 postgresql.keystore
-rw-rw-r-- 1 user user 2285 Aug 24 12:37 postgresql.p12
```

Logged into Linux with the account named `user`, EDB\*Plus is successfully invoked with the `ssl=true` parameter:

```text
$ export PGSSLCERTPASS=keypass
$ export PGSSLKEYPASS=exppass
$ cd /opt/edb/as12/edbplus
$ ./edbplus.sh enterprisedb/password@192.168.2.22:5444/edb?ssl=true
Connected to EnterpriseDB 12.0.1 (192.168.2.22:5444/edb) AS enterprisedb

EDB*Plus: Release 12 (Build 38.0.0)
Copyright (c) 2008-2021, EnterpriseDB Corporation. All rights reserved.

SQL>
```

Alternatively, without placing the certificate and keystore files in `~/.postgresql`, but in a different directory, EDB\*Plus can be invoked in the following manner:

```text
$ export PGSSLCERT=/home/user/ssl/postgresql.keystore
$ export PGSSLKEY=/home/user/ssl/postgresql.p12
$ export PGSSLCERTPASS=keypass
$ export PGSSLKEYPASS=exppass
$ cd /opt/edb/as12/edbplus
$ ./edbplus.sh enterprisedb/password@192.168.2.22:5444/edb?ssl=true
Connected to EnterpriseDB 12.0.1 (192.168.2.22:5444/edb) AS enterprisedb

EDB*Plus: Release 12 (Build 38.0.0)
Copyright (c) 2008-2021, EnterpriseDB Corporation. All rights reserved.

SQL>
```

Note that in both cases the database user name used to log into EDB\*Plus is `enterprisedb` as this is the user specified for the common name field when creating the certificate in Step 1 of [Configuring SSL on Advanced Server](#using_ssl_connection).

Other database user names can be used if the `pg_hba.conf` file with the `map` option and the `pg_ident.conf` file are used as described in Steps 8 and 9 of [Configuring SSL on Advanced Server](#using_ssl_connection).
