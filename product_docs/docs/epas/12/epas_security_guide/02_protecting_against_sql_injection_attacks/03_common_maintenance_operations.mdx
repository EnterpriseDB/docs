The following describes how to perform other common operations.

You must be connected as a superuser to perform these operations and have included the `sqlprotect` schema in your search path.

## Adding a Role to the Protected Roles List

To add a role to the protected roles list run `protect_role('rolename')` as shown in the following example:

```text
edb=# SELECT protect_role('newuser');
 protect_role
--------------
(1 row)
```

## Removing a Role From the Protected Roles List

To remove a role from the protected roles list, use either of the following functions:

```text
unprotect_role('rolename')

unprotect_role(roleoid)
```

The variation of the function using the `OID` is useful if you remove the role using the `DROP ROLE` or `DROP USER` SQL statement before removing the role from the protected roles list. If a query on a SQL/Protect relation returns a value such as `unknown (OID=16458)` for the user name, use the `unprotect_role(roleoid)` form of the function to remove the entry for the deleted role from the protected roles list.

Removing a role using these functions also removes the role’s protected relations list.

The statistics for a role that has been removed are not deleted until you use the [drop_stats function](#drop_stats).

The offending queries for a role that has been removed are not deleted until you use the [drop_queries function](#drop_queries).

The following is an example of the `unprotect_role` function:

```text
edb=# SELECT unprotect_role('newuser');
 unprotect_role
----------------
(1 row)
```

Alternatively, the role could be removed by giving its OID of `16693`:

```text
edb=# SELECT unprotect_role(16693);
 unprotect_role
----------------
(1 row)
```

## Setting the Types of Protection for a Role

You can change whether or not a role is protected from a certain type of SQL injection attack.

Change the Boolean value for the column in `edb_sql_protect` corresponding to the type of SQL injection attack for which protection of a role is to be disabled or enabled.

Be sure to qualify the following columns in your `WHERE` clause of the statement that updates `edb_sql_protect`:

-   **dbid.** OID of the database for which you are making the change
-   **roleid.** OID of the role for which you are changing the Boolean settings

For example, to allow a given role to issue utility commands, update the `allow_utility_cmds` column as follows:

```text
UPDATE edb_sql_protect SET allow_utility_cmds = TRUE WHERE dbid =
13917 AND roleid = 16671;
```

You can verify the change was made by querying `edb_sql_protect` or `list_protected_users`. In the following query note that column `allow_utility_cmds` now contains `t`:

```text
edb=# SELECT dbid, roleid, allow_utility_cmds FROM edb_sql_protect;
 dbid   | roleid | allow_utility_cmds
--------+--------+--------------------
 13917  | 16671  | t
(1 row)
```

The updated rules take effect on new sessions started by the role since the change was made.

## Removing a Relation From the Protected Relations List

If SQL/Protect has learned that a given relation is accessible for a given role, you can subsequently remove that relation from the role’s protected relations list.

Delete its entry from the `edb_sql_protect_rel` table using any of the following functions:

```text
unprotect_rel('rolename', 'relname') 
unprotect_rel('rolename', 'schema', 'relname') 
unprotect_rel(roleoid, reloid)
```

If the relation given by `relname` is not in your current search path, specify the relation’s schema using the second function format.

The third function format allows you to specify the OIDs of the role and relation, respectively, instead of their text names.

The following example illustrates the removal of the `public.emp` relation from the protected relations list of the role `appuser`:

```text
edb=# SELECT unprotect_rel('appuser', 'public', 'emp');
 unprotect_rel
---------------
(1 row)
```

The following query shows there is no longer an entry for the `emp` relation:

```text
edb=# SELECT * FROM list_protected_rels;
 Database | Protected User | Schema |    Name     | Type  |    Owner
----------+----------------+--------+-------------+-------+--------------
 edb      | appuser        | public | dept        | Table | enterprisedb
 edb      | appuser        | public | appuser_tab | Table | appuser
(2 rows)
```

SQL/Protect will now issue a warning or completely block access (depending upon the setting of `edb_sql_protect.level`) whenever the role attempts to utilize that relation.

## Deleting Statistics

You can delete statistics from view `edb_sql_protect_stats` using either of the two following functions:

```text
drop_stats('rolename')

drop_stats(roleoid)
```

The variation of the function using the OID is useful if you remove the role using the `DROP ROLE` or `DROP USER` SQL statement before deleting the role’s statistics using `drop_stats('rolename')`. If a query on `edb_sql_protect_stats` returns a value such as `unknown (OID=16458)` for the user name, use the `drop_stats(roleoid)` form of the function to remove the deleted role’s statistics from `edb_sql_protect_stats`.

The following is an example of the `drop_stats` function:

```text
edb=# SELECT drop_stats('appuser');
 drop_stats
------------
(1 row)

edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_sql_protect_stats;
 username  | superusers | relations | commands | tautology | dml
-----------+------------+-----------+----------+-----------+-----
(0 rows)
```

The following is an example of using the `drop_stats(roleoid)` form of the function when a role is dropped before deleting its statistics:

```text
edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_sql_protect_stats;
      username       | superusers | relations | commands | tautology | dml
---------------------+------------+-----------+----------+-----------+-----
 unknown (OID=16693) |          0 |         5 |        3 |         1 |   0
 appuser             |          0 |         5 |        2 |         1 |   0
(2 rows)

edb=# SELECT drop_stats(16693);
 drop_stats
------------

(1 row)

edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_sql_protect_stats;
 username | superusers | relations | commands | tautology | dml
----------+------------+-----------+----------+-----------+-----
 appuser  |          0 |         5 |        2 |         1 |   0
(1 row)
```

<div id="drop_queries" class="registered_link"></div>

## Deleting Offending Queries

You can delete offending queries from `view edb_sql_protect_queries` using either of the two following functions:

```text
drop_queries('rolename')

drop_queries(roleoid)
```

The variation of the function using the OID is useful if you remove the role using the `DROP ROLE` or `DROP USER` SQL statement before deleting the role’s offending queries using `drop_queries('rolename')`. If a query on `edb_sql_protect_queries` returns a value such as `unknown (OID=16454)` for the user name, use the `drop_queries(roleoid)` form of the function to remove the deleted role’s offending queries from `edb_sql_protect_queries`.

The following is an example of the `drop_queries` function:

```text
edb=# SELECT drop_queries('appuser');
 drop_queries
--------------
           5
(1 row)

edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_sql_protect_queries;
 username  | ip_address | port | machine_name | date_time | query
-----------+------------+------+--------------+-----------+-------
(0 rows)
```

The following is an example of using the `drop_queries(roleoid)` form of the function when a role is dropped before deleting its queries:

```text
edb=# SELECT username, query FROM edb_sql_protect_queries;
      username       |                    query
---------------------+----------------------------------------------
 unknown (OID=16454) | CREATE TABLE appuser_tab_2 (f1 INTEGER);
 unknown (OID=16454) | INSERT INTO appuser_tab_2 VALUES (2);
 unknown (OID=16454) | CREATE TABLE appuser_tab_3 (f1 INTEGER);
 unknown (OID=16454) | INSERT INTO appuser_tab_2 VALUES (1);
 unknown (OID=16454) | SELECT * FROM appuser_tab_2 WHERE 'x' = 'x';
(5 rows)

edb=# SELECT drop_queries(16454);
 drop_queries
--------------
          5
(1 row)

edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_sql_protect_queries;
 username | ip_address | port | machine_name | date_time | query
----------+------------+------+--------------+-----------+-------
(0 rows)
```

## Disabling and Enabling Monitoring

If you wish to turn off SQL/Protect monitoring, modify the `postgresql.conf` file, setting the `edb_sql_protect.enabled` parameter to `off`. After saving the file, reload the server configuration to apply the settings.

If you wish to turn on SQL/Protect monitoring, modify the `postgresql.conf` file, setting the `edb_sql_protect.enabled` parameter to `on`. After saving the file, reload the server configuration to apply the settings.
