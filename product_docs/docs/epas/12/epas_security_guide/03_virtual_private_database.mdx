`Virtual Private Database` is a type of fine-grained access control using security policies. `Fine-grained access control` means that access to data can be controlled down to specific rows as defined by the security policy.

The rules that encode a security policy are defined in a *policy function*, which is an SPL function with certain input parameters and return value. The *security policy* is the named association of the policy function to a particular database object, typically a table.

In Advanced Server, the policy function can be written in any language supported by Advanced Server such as SQL and PL/pgSQL in addition to SPL.

!!! Note
    The database objects currently supported by Advanced Server Virtual Private Database are tables. Policies cannot be applied to views or synonyms.

The advantages of using Virtual Private Database are the following:

-   Provides a fine-grained level of security. Database object level privileges given by the `GRANT` command determine access privileges to the entire instance of a database object, while Virtual Private Database provides access control for the individual rows of a database object instance.
-   A different security policy can be applied depending upon the type of SQL command (`INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, or SELECT`).
-   The security policy can vary dynamically for each applicable SQL command affecting the database object depending upon factors such as the session user of the application accessing the database object.
-   Invocation of the security policy is transparent to all applications that access the database object and thus, individual applications do not have to be modified to apply the security policy.
-   Once a security policy is enabled, it is not possible for any application (including new applications) to circumvent the security policy except by the system privilege noted by the following.
-   Even superusers cannot circumvent the security policy except by the system privilege noted by the following.

!!! Note
    The only way security policies can be circumvented is if the `EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY` system privilege has been granted to a user. The `EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY` privilege should be granted with extreme care as a user with this privilege is exempted from all policies in the database.

The `DBMS_RLS` package provides procedures to create policies, remove policies, enable policies, and disable policies.
