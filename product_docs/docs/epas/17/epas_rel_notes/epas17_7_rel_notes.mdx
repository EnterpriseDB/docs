navTitle: "Version 17.7.0"

Released: 13 Nov 2025

EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17.7.0 includes the following enhancements and bug fixes:

!!! Note Deprecation
With the release of EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17, the DRITA is being deprecated and will not be included in EDB Postgres Advanced Server 18. This decision follows the introduction of [EDB’s PWR](/pwr/latest/) and [`edb_wait_states`](/pg_extensions/wait_states/) extensions, which offer improved diagnostic capabilities compared to DRITA. These new extensions provide a diagnostic experience more closely aligned with Oracle’s AWR reports, making DRITA obsolete.
!!!

!!! Note 
The `pgAgent` and `adminpack` packages are end of life in EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17 and later.
