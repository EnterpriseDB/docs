| Enhancement    | Added synonym support for packages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |          |
| Enhancement    | The `TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ()` function now takes a single argument that converts a string to `TIMESTAMPTZ` in the default format.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |          |
