title: EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17.2 release notes
navTitle: "Version 17.2"
---

Released: 22 Nov 2024

EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17.2 includes the following enhancements and bug fixes:

!!! Note Deprecation
With the release of EPAS 17, the DRITA is being deprecated and will not be included in EPAS 18. This decision follows the introduction of [EDB’s PWR](/pwr/latest/) and [`edb_wait_states`](/pg_extensions/wait_states/) extensions, which offer improved diagnostic capabilities compared to DRITA. These new extensions provide a diagnostic experience more closely aligned with Oracle’s AWR reports, making DRITA obsolete.
!!!

!!! Note 
The `pgAgent` and `adminpack` packages are end of life from EPAS 17 and later.
