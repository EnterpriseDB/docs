navTitle: "Version 17.6.0"
---

Released: 14 Aug 2025

EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17.6.0 includes the following enhancements and bug fixes:

!!! Note Deprecation
With the release of EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17, the DRITA is being deprecated and will not be included in EDB Postgres Advanced Server 18. This decision follows the introduction of [EDB’s PWR](/pwr/latest/) and [`edb_wait_states`](/pg_extensions/wait_states/) extensions, which offer improved diagnostic capabilities compared to DRITA. These new extensions provide a diagnostic experience more closely aligned with Oracle’s AWR reports, making DRITA obsolete.
!!!

!!! Note 
The `pgAgent` and `adminpack` packages are end of life in EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17 and later.

| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue where a high number of concurrent failed login attempts for a user was leading to an unexpected server behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                                                                                     |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue by ensuring the SPL library is initialized before accessing its symbols to avoid errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | #44514                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue in EDB*Loader where the SKIP parameter did not work correctly in direct-path mode on tables with column constraints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | #44853                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue in `dblink_oci` that caused a random server crash when performing bytea inserts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | #49578                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue where `to_date()` was not handling empty strings gracefully.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | #49346                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue in `edb_audit` that was causing unexpected audit logs during user login.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | #48070                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue where an error occurred with SPLIT PARTITION on tables that use a GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY column.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | #49164                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue in `SUBSTRB()` that caused garbage bytes to appear in the return string. The function now replaces partial multi-byte characters with spaces to prevent this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | #46619                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue where `edb_last_ddl_time` entries were not being correctly flushed during autonomous transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                                                                                                     |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue in automatic partitioning that was creating an `edb_last_ddl_time` entry even when an error occurred.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | #49412                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue in INSTR() where it returned inaccurate results when used with multi-byte characters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | #100419, #49178                                                                                     |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue in `edb_job_scheduler` where the launcher process was not automatically restarting after an unexpected termination.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | #50079                                                                                              |
