navTitle: "Version 17.3"

Released: 13 Feb 2025

EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17.3 includes the following enhancements and bug fixes:

!!! Note Deprecation
With the release of EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17, the DRITA is being deprecated and will not be included in EDB Postgres Advanced Server 18. This decision follows the introduction of [EDB’s PWR](/pwr/latest/) and [`edb_wait_states`](/pg_extensions/wait_states/) extensions, which offer improved diagnostic capabilities compared to DRITA. These new extensions provide a diagnostic experience more closely aligned with Oracle’s AWR reports, making DRITA obsolete.
!!!

!!! Note 
The `pgAgent` and `adminpack` packages are end of life in EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17 and later.

| Upstream merge | Merged with community PostgreSQL 17.3. This release includes a fix for [CVE-2025-1094](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2025-1094/). See the [PostgreSQL 17.3 Release Notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/17.3/) for more information. |                                                                                                     |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue for ECPG. ECPGPlus is now aligned with behavior of `Oracle Pro*C` by supporting `DESCRIBE BIND VARIABLE` and prevents crashes and random failures.                                                                                                | #42790                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue for ECPG. ECPGPlus now prevents the parser anomalies especially during the usage of "/".                                                                                                                                                          | #37400                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue for ECPG. Now it supports the global declarations of unknown C types in `Pro*C` mode.                                                                                                                                                             | #37049                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue for `edb_audit`. It prevents the creation of an empty log file when the audit destination is set to `syslog`.                                                                                                                                     | #39883                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed occasional crashes for ECPG. Added the correct `DESCRIBE SELECT LIST` grammar rule to retrieve the `SELECT LIST` descriptor properly which prevents potential unknown issues and occasional crashes.                                                       | #41977                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue for `pg_dump`. Now the memory size for the `ROWID` hidden column is fixed to avoid `OOM` errors.                                                                                                                                                  | #43579                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue for `edb_job_scheduler`. Added a new GUC parameter, `max_database_list_size`, that allows the modification of the `database_list` GUC parameter without restarting the server.                                                                    |                                                                                                     |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue for `edb_job_scheduler`. Fixed the `pg_upgrade` to ensure the `edb_job_scheduler` extension's catalog data is copied to the new cluster while upgrading.                                                                                          |                                                                                                     |
