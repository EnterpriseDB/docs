---

You can use `pg_upgrade` to upgrade from an existing installation of EDB Postgres Advanced Server into the cluster built by the EDB Postgres Advanced Server installer or into an alternative cluster created using the `initdb` command. 

The basic steps to perform an upgrade into an empty cluster created with the `initdb` command are the same as the steps to upgrade into the cluster created by the EDB Postgres Advanced Server installer. However, you can omit Step 2 - Empty the edb database and substitute the location of the alternative cluster when specifying a target cluster for the upgrade.

If a problem occurs during the upgrade process, you can revert to the previous version. See [Reverting to the old cluster](06_reverting_to_the_old_cluster/#reverting_to_the_old_cluster) for detailed information about this process.

You must be an operating system superuser or Windows Administrator to perform an EDB Postgres Advanced Server upgrade.

## Step 1 - Install the new server

Install the new version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server, specifying the same non-server components that were installed during the previous EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation. The new cluster and the old cluster must reside in different directories.

## Step 2 - Empty the target database

The target cluster must not contain any data. You can create an empty cluster using the `initdb` command, or you can empty a database that was created during the installation of EDB Postgres Advanced Server. If you installed EDB Postgres Advanced Server in PostgreSQL mode, the installer creates a single database named `postgres`. Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server in Oracle mode creates a database named `postgres` and a database named `edb`.

The easiest way to empty the target database is to drop the database and then create a new database. Before invoking the `DROP DATABASE` command, you must disconnect any users and halt any services that are currently using the database.

On Windows, from the Control Panel, go to the Services manager. Select each service in the **Services** list, and select **Stop**.

On Linux, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and manually stop each service. For example, invoke the following command to stop the pgAgent service:

```shell
service edb-pgagent-17 stop
```

After stopping any services that are currently connected to EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you can use the EDB-PSQL command line client to drop and create a database. When the client opens, connect to the `template1` database as the database superuser. If prompted, provide authentication information. Then, use the following command to drop your database:

```sql
DROP DATABASE <database_name>;
```

Where `database_name` is the name of the database.

Then, create an empty database based on the contents of the `template1` database.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE <database_name>;
```

## Step 3 - Set both servers in trust mode

During the upgrade process, `pg_upgrade` connects to the old and new servers several times. To make the connection process easier, you can edit the `pg_hba.conf` file, setting the authentication mode to `trust`. To modify the `pg_hba.conf` file, from the Start menu, select **EDB Postgres > EDB Postgres Advanced Server > Expert Configuration**. Select **Edit pg_hba.conf** to open the `pg_hba.conf` file.

You must allow trust authentication for the previous EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation and EDB Postgres Advanced Server servers. Edit the `pg_hba.conf` file for both installations of EDB Postgres Advanced Server as shown in the figure.

![Configuring EDB Postgres Advanced Server to use trust authentication.](../../images/configuring_advanced_server_to_use_trust_authentication.png)

After editing each file, save the file and exit the editor.

If the system is required to maintain `md5` authentication mode during the upgrade process, you can specify user passwords for the database superuser in a password file (`pgpass.conf` on Windows, `.pgpass` on Linux). For more information about configuring a password file, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/libpq-pgpass.html).

## Step 4 - Stop all component services and servers

Before you invoke `pg_upgrade`, you must stop any services that belong to the original EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation, EDB Postgres Advanced Server, or the supporting components. Stopping these services ensures that a service doesn't attempt to access either cluster during the upgrade process.

The services in the table are most likely to be running in your installation.

### To stop a service on Windows

Open the Services applet. Select each EDB Postgres Advanced Server or supporting component service displayed in the list, and select **Stop**.

### To stop a service on Linux

Open a terminal window and manually stop each service at the command line.

## Step 5 for Linux only - Assume the identity of the cluster owner

If you're using Linux, assume the identity of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server cluster owner. This example assumes EDB Postgres Advanced Server was installed in the default, compatibility-with-Oracle database mode, assigning `enterprisedb` as the cluster owner. (If installed in compatibility-with-PostgreSQL database mode, `postgres` is the cluster owner.)

```shell
su - enterprisedb
```

If prompted, enter the EDB Postgres Advanced Server cluster owner password. Then, set the path to include the location of the `pg_upgrade` executable:

```shell
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/edb/as17/bin
```

During the upgrade process, `pg_upgrade` writes a file to the current working directory of the `enterprisedb` user. You must invoke `pg_upgrade` from a directory where the `enterprisedb` user has write privileges. After performing the previous commands, navigate to a directory in which the `enterprisedb` user has sufficient privileges to write a file.

```shell
cd /tmp
```

## Step 5 for Windows only - Assume the identity of the cluster owner

If you're using Windows, open a terminal window, assume the identity of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server cluster owner, and set the path to the `pg_upgrade` executable.

If the `--serviceaccount service_account_user` parameter was specified during the initial installation of EDB Postgres Advanced Server, then `service_account_user` is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server cluster owner. In that case, give this user with the `RUNAS` command:

```sql
RUNAS /USER:service_account_user "CMD.EXE"
SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\edb\as17\bin
```

During the upgrade process, `pg_upgrade` writes a file to the current working directory of the service account user. You must invoke `pg_upgrade` from a directory where the service account user has write privileges. After performing the previous commands, navigate to a directory in which the service account user has privileges to write a file:

```shell
cd %TEMP%
```

If you omitted the `--serviceaccount` parameter during the initial installation of EDB Postgres Advanced Server, then the default owner of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server service and the database cluster is `NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService`.

When `NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService` is the service account user, the `RUNAS` command might not be usable. It prompts for a password, and the `NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService` account isn't assigned a password. Thus, there's typically a failure with an error message such as “Unable to acquire user password.”

Under this circumstance, you must use the Windows utility program `PsExec` to run `CMD.EXE` as the service account `NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService`.

Obtain the `PsExec` program by downloading `PsTools`, which is available at the [Microsoft site](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897553.aspx).

You can then use the following command to run `CMD.EXE` as `NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService`. Then set the path to the `pg_upgrade` executable:

```shell
psexec.exe -u "NT AUTHORITY\NetworkService" CMD.EXE
SET PATH=%PATH%;C:\Program Files\edb\as17\bin
```

During the upgrade process, `pg_upgrade` writes a file to the current working directory of the service account user. You must invoke `pg_upgrade` from a directory where the service account user has write privileges. After performing the previous commands, navigate to a directory in which the service account user has privileges to write a file:

```shell
cd %TEMP%
```

## Step 6 - Perform a consistency check

Before attempting an upgrade, perform a consistency check to ensure that the old and new clusters are compatible and properly configured. Include the `--check` option to instruct `pg_upgrade` to perform the consistency check.

This example shows invoking `pg_upgrade` to perform a consistency check on Linux:

```shell
pg_upgrade -d /var/lib/edb/as15/data
-D /var/lib/edb/as17/data -U enterprisedb
-b /usr/edb/as15/bin -B /usr/edb/as17/bin -p 5444 -P 5445 --check
```

If the command is successful, it returns `*Clusters are compatible*`.

If you're using Windows, quote any directory names that contain a space:

```shell
pg_upgrade.exe
-d "C:\Program Files\ PostgresPlus\15AS\data"
-D "C:\Program Files\edb\as17\data" -U enterprisedb
-b "C:\Program Files\PostgresPlus\15AS\bin"
-B "C:\Program Files\edb\as17\bin" -p 5444 -P 5445 --check
```

During the consistency checking process, `pg_upgrade` logs any discrepancies that it finds to a file located in the directory from which you invoked `pg_upgrade`. When the consistency check completes, review the file to identify any missing components or upgrade conflicts. Resolve any conflicts before invoking `pg_upgrade` to perform a version upgrade.

If `pg_upgrade` alerts you to a missing component, you can use StackBuilder Plus to add the component that contains the component. Before using StackBuilder Plus, restart the EDB Postgres Advanced Server service. Then, open StackBuilder Plus by selecting from the Start menu **EDB Postgres Advanced Server *version* > StackBuilder Plus**. Follow the onscreen advice of the StackBuilder Plus wizard to download and install the missing components.

After `pg_upgrade` confirms that the clusters are compatible, you can perform a version upgrade.

## Step 7 - Run pg_upgrade

After confirming that the clusters are compatible, you can invoke `pg_upgrade` to upgrade the old cluster to the new version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

On Linux:

```shell
pg_upgrade -d /var/lib/edb/as15/data
-D /var/lib/edb/as17/data -U enterprisedb
-b /usr/edb/as15/bin -B /usr/edb/as17/bin -p 5444 -P 5445
```

On Windows:

```shell
pg_upgrade.exe -d "C:\Program Files\PostgresPlus\15AS\data"
-D "C:\Program Files\edb\as17\data" -U enterprisedb
-b "C:\Program Files\PostgresPlus\15AS\bin"
-B "C:\Program Files\edb\as17\bin" -p 5444 -P 5445
```

`pg_upgrade` displays the progress of the upgrade onscreen:

```shell
$ pg_upgrade -d /var/lib/edb/as15/data -D /var/lib/edb/as17/data -U
enterprisedb -b /usr/edb/as15/bin -B /usr/edb/as17/bin -p 5444 -P 5445
Performing Consistency Checks
-----------------------------
Checking current, bin, and data directories            ok
Checking cluster versions                              ok
Checking database user is a superuser                  ok
Checking for prepared transactions                     ok
Checking for reg* system OID user data types           ok

Checking database user is a superuser                  ok
Checking for prepared transactions                     ok

```

If `pg_upgrade` fails after this point, you must re-initdb the new cluster before continuing. Otherwise, it continues as follows:

```shell
Performing Upgrade

Creating script to analyze new cluster                 ok
Creating script to delete old cluster                  ok

Upgrade Complete
----------------
Optimizer statistics are not transferred by pg_upgrade so,
once you start the new server, consider running:
    analyze_new_cluster.sh

Running this script will delete the old cluster's data files:
    delete_old_cluster.sh
```

While `pg_upgrade` runs, it might generate SQL scripts that handle special circumstances that it encountered during your upgrade. For example, if the old cluster contains large objects, you might need to invoke a script that defines the default permissions for the objects in the new cluster. When performing the pre-upgrade consistency check, `pg_upgrade` alerts you to any script that you might need to run manually.

You must invoke the scripts after `pg_upgrade` completes. To invoke the scripts, connect to the new cluster as a database superuser with the EDB-PSQL command-line client, and invoke each script using the `\i` option:

```shell
\i complete_path_to_script/script.sql
```

It's generally unsafe to access tables referenced in rebuild scripts until the rebuild scripts finish. Accessing the tables might yield incorrect results or poor performance. You can access tables not referenced in rebuild scripts immediately.

If `pg_upgrade` fails to complete the upgrade process, the old cluster is unchanged except that `$PGDATA/global/pg_control` is renamed to `pg_control.old` and each tablespace is renamed to `tablespace.old`. To revert to the pre-invocation state:

1.  Delete any tablespace directories created by the new cluster.
2.  Rename `$PGDATA/global/pg_control`, removing the `.old` suffix.
3.  Rename the old cluster tablespace directory names, removing the `.old` suffix.
4.  Remove any database objects from the new cluster that were moved before the upgrade failed.

Then, resolve any upgrade conflicts encountered and try the upgrade again.

When the upgrade is complete, `pg_upgrade` might also recommend vacuuming the new cluster. It provides a script that allows you to delete the old cluster.

!!! Note
    In case you need to revert to a previous version, before removing the old cluster, make sure that you have a backup of the cluster and that the cluster was upgraded.

## Step 8 - Restore the authentication settings in the pg_hba.conf file

If you modified the `pg_hba.conf` file to permit `trust` authentication, update the contents of the `pg_hba.conf` file to reflect your preferred authentication settings.

## Step 9 - Move and identify user-defined tablespaces (optional)

If you have data stored in a user-defined tablespace, you must manually relocate tablespace files after upgrading. Move the files to the new location, and update the symbolic links to point to the files. The symbolic links are located in the `pg_tblspc` directory under your cluster's `data` directory.
