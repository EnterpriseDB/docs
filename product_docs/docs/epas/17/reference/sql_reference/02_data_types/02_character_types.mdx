## Overview

SQL defines two primary character types: `CHARACTER VARYING(n)` and `CHARACTER(n)`, where `n` is a positive integer. These types can store strings up to `n` characters in length. If you don't specify a value for `n`, `n` defaults to `1`. Assigning a value that exceeds the length of `n` results in an error unless the excess characters are all spaces. In this case, the string is truncated to the maximum length. If the string to be stored is shorter than `n`, values of type `CHARACTER` are space-padded to the specified width (`n`) and are stored and displayed that way; values of type `CHARACTER VARYING` simply store the shorter string.

If you explicitly cast a value to `CHARACTER VARYING(n)` or `CHARACTER(n)`, an over-length value is truncated to n characters without raising an error.

The notations `VARCHAR(n)` and `CHAR(n)` are aliases for `CHARACTER VARYING(n)` and `CHARACTER(n)`, respectively. If specified, the length must be greater than zero and cannot exceed 10485760. `CHARACTER` without a length specifier is equivalent to `CHARACTER(1)`. If `CHARACTER VARYING` is used without a length specifier, the type accepts strings of any size. The latter is a PostgreSQL extension.

In addition, PostgreSQL provides the `TEXT` type, which stores strings of any length. Although the type T$XT is not in the SQL standard, several other SQL database management systems have it as well.

Values of type `CHARACTER` are physically padded with spaces to the specified width n, and are stored and displayed that way. However, trailing spaces are treated as semantically insignificant and disregarded when comparing two values of type `CHARACTER`. In collations where whitespace is significant, this behavior can produce unexpected results; for example `SELECT 'a '::CHAR(2) collate "C" < E'a\n'::CHAR(2)` returns true, even though C locale would consider a space to be greater than a newline. Trailing spaces are removed when converting a `CHARACTER` value to one of the other string types. Note that trailing spaces are semantically significant in `CHARACTER VARYING` and `TEXT` values, and when using pattern matching, that is `LIKE` and regular expressions.

The characters that can be stored in any of these data types are determined by the database character set, which is selected when the database is created. Regardless of the specific character set, the character with code zero (sometimes called `NUL`) can't be stored. For more information refer to [Character Set Support](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/multibyte.html).

The storage requirement for a short string (up to 126 bytes) is 1 byte plus the actual string, which includes the space padding in the case of `CHARACTER`. Longer strings have 4 bytes of overhead instead of 1. Long strings are compressed by the system automatically, so the physical requirement on disk might be less. Very long values are also stored in background tables so that they do not interfere with rapid access to shorter column values. In any case, the longest possible character string that can be stored is about 1 GB. (The maximum value that is allowed for n in the data type declaration is less than that. It wouldn't be useful to change this because with multibyte character encodings the number of characters and bytes can be quite different. If you desire to store long strings with no specific upper limit, use `TEXT` or `CHARACTER VARYING` without a length specifier, rather than making up an arbitrary length limit.)

!!!Tip
There is no performance difference among these three types, apart from increased storage space when using the blank-padded type, and a few extra CPU cycles to check the length when storing into a length-constrained column. While `CHARACTER(n)` has performance advantages in some other database systems, there is no such advantage in PostgreSQL; in fact CHARACTER(n) is usually the slowest of the three because of its additional storage costs. In most situations `TEXT` or `CHARACTER VARYING` should be used instead.

Refer to the [Postgres documentation on string constances](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-syntax-lexical.html#SQL-SYNTAX-STRINGS) for information about the syntax of string literals and [functions and operators](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions.html) for information about available operators and functions.

Example: Using the character types

```sql
CREATE TABLE test1 (a character(4));
INSERT INTO test1 VALUES ('ok');
SELECT a, char_length(a) FROM test1; -- (1)

  a   | char_length
------+-------------
 ok   |           2


CREATE TABLE test2 (b varchar(5));
INSERT INTO test2 VALUES ('ok');
INSERT INTO test2 VALUES ('good      ');
INSERT INTO test2 VALUES ('too long');
ERROR:  value too long for type character varying(5)
INSERT INTO test2 VALUES ('too long'::varchar(5)); -- explicit truncation
SELECT b, char_length(b) FROM test2;

   b   | char_length
-------+-------------
 ok    |           2
 good  |           5
 too l |           5
```

There are two other fixed-length character types in PostgreSQL, shown in the following table. These are not intended for general-purpose use, only for use in the internal system catalogs. The `NAME` type is used to store identifiers. Its length is currently defined as 64 bytes (63 usable characters plus terminator) but should be referenced using the constant NAMEDATALEN in C source code. The length is set at compile time (and is therefore adjustable for special uses); the default maximum length might change in a future release. The type "CHAR" (note the quotes) is different from `CHAR(1)` in that it only uses one byte of storage, and therefore can store only a single ASCII character. It is used in the system catalogs as a simplistic enumeration type.

## Special Character Types

| Name   | Storage Size | Description |
| ------ | ------------ | ----------- |
| "CHAR" | 1 byte	      | single-byte  internal type |
| `NAME` | 64 bytes     |	internal type for object names |

 You can store a large character string in a `CLOB` type. `CLOB` is semantically equivalent to `VARCHAR2` except no length limit is specified. Generally, use a `CLOB` type if you don't know the maximum string length.

 The longest possible character string that you can store in a `CLOB` type is about 1 GB.

!!!Note 
   The `CLOB` data type is actually a `DOMAIN` based on the PostgreSQL `TEXT` data type. For information on a `DOMAIN`, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createdomain.html).

 Thus, use of the `CLOB` type is limited by what can be done for `TEXT`, such as a maximum size of approximately 1 GB.

 For larger amounts of data, instead of using the `CLOB` data type, use the PostgreSQL *large objects* feature that relies on the `pg_largeobject` system catalog. For information on large objects, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/largeobjects.html).
