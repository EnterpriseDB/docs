| Data type | Native | Alias  |                                     Description                                       |
| --------- | ------ | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `MONEY`   |        | âœ…     | Currency amount, 8 byte storage, -92233720368547758.08 to +92233720368547758.07 range |

## Overview

The `MONEY` type stores a currency amount with a fixed fractional precision. The fractional precision is determined by the database's `lc_monetary` setting. The range assumes there are two fractional digits. Input is accepted in a variety of formats, including integer and floating-point literals, as well as typical currency formatting, such as '$1,000.00'. Output is generally in the latter form but depends on the locale.

Since the output of this data type is locale-sensitive, it might not work to load money data into a database that has a different setting of `lc_monetary`. To avoid problems, before restoring a dump into a new database make sure `lc_monetary` has the same or equivalent value as in the database that was dumped.

Values of `NUMERIC`, `INT`, and `BIGINT` data types can be cast to `MONEY`. Conversion from `REAL` and `DOUBLE PRECISION` data types can be done by casting to `NUMERIC` first, for example:

```sql
SELECT '12.34'::float8::numeric::money;
```

However, this is not recommended. Floating point numbers shouldn't be used to handle money due to the potential for rounding errors.

A money value can be cast to `NUMERIC` without loss of precision. Conversion to other types could potentially lose precision, and must also be done in two stages:

```sql
SELECT '52093.89'::money::numeric::float8;
```

Division of a money value by an integer value is performed with truncation of the fractional part towards zero. To get a rounded result, divide by a floating-point value, or cast the money value to numeric before dividing and back to money afterwards. (The latter is preferable to avoid risking precision loss.) When a money value is divided by another money value, the result is double precision (that is, a pure number, not money); the currency units cancel each other out in the division.
