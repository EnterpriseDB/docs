| `POINT`         | ✅     |       | Point on a plane, 16 bytes storage, represented as `(x,y)`.               |
| `LINE`          | ✅     |       | Infinite line, 32 bytes storage, represented as `{A,B,C}`.                |
| `LSEG`          | ✅     |       | Finite line segment, 32 bytes storage, represented as `((x1,y1),(x2,y2))`. |
| `BOX`           | ✅     |       | Rectangular box, 32 bytes storage, represented as `((x1,y1),(x2,y2))`.    |
| `PATH`          | ✅     |       | Closed path (similar to polygon), 16 + 16n bytes storage, represented as `((x1,y1),...)`. |
| `PATH`          | ✅     |       | Open path, 16 + 16n bytes storage, represented as `[(x1,y1),...]`.  |
| `POLYGON`       | ✅     |       | Polygon (similar to closed path), 40 + 16n bytes storage, represented as `((x1,y1),...)`. |
| `CIRCLE`        | ✅     |       | Circle, 24 bytes storage, represented as `<(x,y),r>` (center point and radius).     |

## Overview

Geometric data types represent two-dimensional spatial objects.

For more information on geometric data types, see [PostgreSQL docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/datatype-geometric.html).
