| `BFILE`     | âœ…     |       | Data type used to store data objects stored in operating system files outside the database tablespaces |

## Overview

BFILEs are data objects stored in operating system files, outside the database tablespaces. Data stored in a table column of type BFILE is physically located in an operating system file. The BFILE column stores a reference to the operating system file.

A BFILE locator is initialized using the function `BFILENAME(DIRECTORY, FILENAME)`. 

In Oracle PL/SQL the BFILE data type stores binary large objects (BLOBs) in external files. This type of datatype differs from the BLOB datatype because BLOB data is stored in the database itself, while BFILE data is stored outside the database in a file system. 

A BFILE column stores a reference to an external binary file, and you can use it to store images, audio, video or other binary data. The actual data is stored outside the database in a file system and is accessed using a file name. This means that the BFILE column contains a file locator that points to the actual binary data stored in the file system.

For more extensive information about BFILEs, see the [Oracle documentation for BFILEs](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/oracle-database/23/adlob/BFILEs.html)

## Directory

A `DIRECTORY` object specifies a logical alias for a physical directory on the database server file system where a file is located. You can access a file in the server file system only if you have the required access privileges on the `DIRECTORY` object.

### Permissions on directory

To perform actions on a directory, the following SQL data definition language (DDL) Directory privileges may be required:

- `CREATE ANY DIRECTORY` allows you to create or alter the DIRECTORY object.

- `DROP ANY DIRECTORY` allows you to delete the DIRECTORY object.

Because `CREATE ANY DIRECTORY` and `DROP ANY DIRECTORY` privileges potentially expose the server file system to all database users, administrators should be prudent in granting these privileges to normal database users.

### Read directory privileges

To grant read permissions on a directory:

```sql
GRANT read on DIRECTORY dir_name to user_name;
```

To revoke read permissions from adirectory:

``` sql
REVOKE read on DIRECTORY dir_name FROM User_Name;
```

The database does not verify that the directory and path name you specify actually exist. You must ensure that you specify a valid directory name in your operating system. If your operating system uses case-sensitive path names, then be sure that you specify the directory name in the correct format. There is no requirement to specify a terminating slash (for example, /tmp/ is not necessary, simply use /tmp).

When defining BFILEs, administrators must ensure that:

- The physical directory path exists
- The directory path remains available, and read permission remains enabled, for the duration of file access by database users

The `BFILENAME()` function does not verify that the directory and path name you specify actually exist. You can use the sanity checking functions to verify that a `BFILE` exists and to extract the directory and file names from a `BFILE` locator.
