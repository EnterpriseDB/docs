| `BFILE`     | âœ…     |       | Data type used to store data objects stored in operating system files outside the database tablespaces |

## Overview

The BFILE data type is used for data objects stored outside the database tablespaces in files accessed through the operating system. The BFILE column holds a reference to an operating system file.

Use this function to initialize a BFILE locator: `BFILENAME(DIRECTORY, FILENAME)`. 

The BFILE data type stores binary large objects (BLOBs) in external files. This type of datatype differs from the BLOB datatype because BLOB data is stored in the database itself while BFILE data is stored outside the database in a file system. 

A BFILE column stores a reference to an external binary file, and you can use it to store images, audio, video or other binary data. The actual data is stored outside the database in a file system and is accessed using a file name. This means that the BFILE column contains a file locator that points to the actual binary data stored in the file system.

When defining BFILEs, administrators must ensure that:

- The physical directory path exists
- The directory path remains available and read permission remains enabled for database users

The `BFILENAME()` function does not verify that the directory and path name you specify actually exist. You can use the sanity checking functions to verify that a `BFILE` exists and to extract the directory and file names from a `BFILE` locator.

### Maximum BFILEs per session

The `max_bfiles_per_session` GUC limits the maximum number of BFILEs that can be open simultaneously. By default that limit is set to 10.

If you change the value of `max_bfiles_per_session`, a restart is necessary.
