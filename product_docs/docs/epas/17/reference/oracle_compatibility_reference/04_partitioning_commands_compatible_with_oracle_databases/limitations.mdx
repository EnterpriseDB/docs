## Limitations for primary or unique keys

For Oracle compatibility, EDB Postgres Advanced Server allows you to use a `CREATE TABLE` statement to create a unique or primary key constraint on a partitioned table that includes a non-partitioned key column. This capability differs from PostgreSQL, and it has the following limitations:

- The primary or unique key is created only on a child table. The key isn't created on a parent or root table.

- When using an `ALTER` statement to create a new partition, the primary or unique key isn't created automatically. You must create it manually.

- The uniqueness of the key is limited to the child partition. The unique key doesn't apply across the partitioning hierarchy. 

## Interval partitioning limitations

Interval range partitioning is a useful capability, but it has the following limitations: 

- Interval partitioning is restricted to a single partition key. If you try to create or alter an existing partitioned table having a multi-column partitioned key, it fails.

- The supported key must be a numerical or date range type.

- You can't define `DEFAULT` and `MAXVALUE` for an interval-partitioned table.

- Data to insert can't have `NULL`, `Not-a-Number`, or `Infinity` values specified in the partitioning key column.

- The interval-partitioning expression must yield a constant value and can't be a negative value.

- For the interval-partitioned table, define at least one partition first.

## Automatic partitioning limitations

Automatic list partitioning has the following limitations:

- Like interval partitioning, automatic partitioning is restricted to a single partition key.

- An automatic partitioned table can't have a `DEFAULT` partition.
