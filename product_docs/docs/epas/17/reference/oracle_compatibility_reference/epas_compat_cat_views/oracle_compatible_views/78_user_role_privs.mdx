The `USER_ROLE_PRIVS` view provides information about the privileges that were granted to the current user. A row is created for each role to which a user has been granted.

| `granted_role` | `TEXT`                 | Name of the role granted to the grantee.                             |
| `admin_option` | `TEXT`                 | `YES` if the role was granted with the admin option, `NO` otherwise. |
