Catalog views provide information about database objects. There are two catagories of catalog views:

- Oracle catalog views provide information about database objects in a manner compatible with the Oracle data dictionary views.

- System catalog views are present in PostgreSQL and might have extra information when accessed in EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

These features related to the catalog views support are provided by EDB Postgres Advanced Server.
