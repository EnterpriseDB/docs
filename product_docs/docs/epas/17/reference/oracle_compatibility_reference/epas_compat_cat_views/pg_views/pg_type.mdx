The `PG_TYPE` view provides information about data types. 

In addition to the information in the [PostgreSQL pg_type description](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-type.html), EDB Postgres Advanced Server provides the following information.

| Name      | Type   | Description                                   |
| --------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------- |
| typaccess | "char" | Specifies whether types contained in packages have PUBLIC or PRIVATE access. This field matters only when there's a packageId in `typnamespace`. |
| typattrs  | text   | Type modifiers, such as FINAL or INSTANTIABLE. |                                                                                   |
