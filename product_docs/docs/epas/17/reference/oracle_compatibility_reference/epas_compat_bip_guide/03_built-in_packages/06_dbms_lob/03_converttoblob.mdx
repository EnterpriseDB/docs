The `CONVERTTOBLOB` procedure converts character data to binary.

```sql
CONVERTTOBLOB(<dest_lob> IN OUT BLOB, <src_clob> CLOB,
  <amount> NUMBER, <dest_offset> IN OUT NUMBER,
  <src_offset> IN OUT NUMBER, <blob_csid> NUMBER,
  <lang_context> IN OUT NUMBER, <warning> OUT NUMBER)
```

## Parameters

`dest_lob`

 `BLOB` large object locator to which to convert the character data.

`src_clob`

 `CLOB` large object locator of the character data to convert.

`amount`

 Number of characters of `src_clob` to convert.

`dest_offset IN`

 Position in bytes in the destination `BLOB` where you want to begin writing the source `CLOB`. The first byte is offset 1.

`dest_offset OUT`

 Position in bytes in the destination `BLOB` after the write operation completes. The first byte is offset 1.

`src_offset IN`

 Position in characters in the source `CLOB` where you want to begin conversion to the destination `BLOB`. The first character is offset 1.

`src_offset OUT`

 Position in characters in the source `CLOB` after the conversion operation completes. The first character is offset 1.

`blob_csid`

 Character set ID of the converted destination `BLOB`.

`lang_context IN`

 Language context for the conversion. The default value of `0` is typically used for this setting.

`lang_context OUT`

 Language context after the conversion completes.

`warning`

 `0` if the conversion was successful, `1` if a character can't be converted.
