The `INTERVAL` procedure sets how often to run a job.

```sql
INTERVAL(<job> BINARY_INTEGER, <interval> VARCHAR2)
```

## Parameters

`job`

 Identifier of the job to modify.

`interval`

 Date function that, when evaluated, provides the next date/time to run the job. If `interval` is `NULL` and the job is complete, the job is removed from the queue.

## Examples

Change the job to run once a week:

```sql
BEGIN
    DBMS_JOB.INTERVAL(104,'SYSDATE + 7');
END;
```
