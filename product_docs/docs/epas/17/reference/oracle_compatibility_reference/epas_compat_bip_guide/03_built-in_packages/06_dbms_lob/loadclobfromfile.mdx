title: "LOADCLOBFROMFILE"
---

The `LOADCLOBFROMFILE` procedure loads data from a BFILE to a CLOB.

```sql
LOADCLOBFROMFILE (<dest_lob> IN OUT BLOB, <src_bfile> IN BFILE, 
   <amount> IN NUMBER, <dest_offset> IN OUT NUMBER, 
   <src_offset> IN OUT NUMBER, <src_csid> IN NUMBER, 
   <lang_context> IN OUT NUMBER, <warning> OUT NUMBER)
```

## Parameters

`dest_lob`

Locator of the CLOB where data will be loaded.

`src_bfile`

Locator of the BFILE that is the source to be loaded.

`amount`

Number of bytes to load.

`dest_offset`

- IN&mdash;The character offset in the destination CLOB that specifies the start of the write. (Origin is considered to be 1.) 

- OUT&mdash;The character offset in the destination CLOB that specifies the end of the write. The location is where the next write begins.

`src_offset`

- IN&mdash;The byte offset in the source BFILE that specifies the start of the read. (Origin is considered to be 1.) 

- OUT&mdash;The character offset in the destination CLOB that specifies the end of this read. This location is also where the next read begins.

`src_csid`

The source BFILE character set ID.

`lang_context`

- IN&mdash;The language context for the current load. 

- OUT&mdash;The language context when the load stops and what the next load is if loading continues from the current source.

`warning`

For OUT, a message warning that something abnormal occurred during loading.


## Example

``` sql
DECLARE
  src_loc     BFILE := BFILENAME('ANOTHER_DIR', 'a.txt');
  dst_loc     CLOB  ;
  amt         NUMBER := dbms_lob.lobmaxsize;
  src_offset  NUMBER := 1;
  dst_offset  NUMBER := 1;
  lang_ctx    NUMBER := dbms_lob.default_lang_ctx;
  warning     NUMBER;
BEGIN
  /* Opening the source BFILE is mandatory */
   DBMS_LOB.OPEN(src_loc, DBMS_LOB.LOB_READONLY);
   DBMS_LOB.LOADCLOBFROMFILE(dst_loc,src_loc, amt, dst_offset, src_offset,                               
       dbms_lob.default_csid, lang_ctx,warning) ;
   COMMIT;
   DBMS_LOB.FILECLOSE(src_loc);
END;
