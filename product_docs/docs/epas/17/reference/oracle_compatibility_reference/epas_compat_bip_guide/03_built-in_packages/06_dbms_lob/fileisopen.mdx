title: "FILEISOPEN, ISOPEN"
---

The `FILEOPEN` and the `ISOPEN` procedures determine whether a BFILE was opened with a specified FILE locator. 

If the FILE locator is not specified to the FILEOPEN procedure, the file is not considered to be opened by this locator. However, a different locator may have this file open. The state of openness is associated with a particular locator.

```sql
FILEISOPEN (<file_loc> IN BFILE) RETURN INTEGER

ISOPEN (<file_loc> IN BFILE) RETURN INTEGER
```

## Parameters

`file_loc`

Locator for the BFILE.
