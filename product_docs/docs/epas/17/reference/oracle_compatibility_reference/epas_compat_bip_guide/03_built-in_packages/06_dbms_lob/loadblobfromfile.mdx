title: "LOADBLOBFROMFILE"
---

The `LOADBLOBFROMFILE` procedure loads data from a BFILE to an internal BLOB.

```sql
LOADBLOBFROMFILE (<dest_lob> IN OUT NOCOPY BLOB, <src_file> IN BFILE, 
   <amount> IN INTEGER, <dest_offset> IN OUT INTEGER, 
   <src_offset> IN OUT INTEGER)
```

## Parameters

`dest_lob`

Locator of the BLOB where data will be loaded.

`src_bfile`

Locator of the BFILE that is the source to be loaded.

`amount`

Number of bytes to load from the BFILE.

`dest_offset`

For IN, the offset in bytes in the destination BLOB (origin: 1) for the start of the write. For OUT, the new offset in bytes in the destination BLOB at the end of this write, which is also where the next write should begin.

`src_offset`

For IN, the offset in bytes in the source BFILE (origin: 1) for the start of the read. For OUT, the offset in bytes in the source BFILE at the end of this read, which is also where the next read should begin.


## Example

``` sql
DECLARE
  src_loc     BFILE := bfilename('AnNOTHER_DIR','b.txt')
  dst_loc     BLOB;
  src_offset  NUMBER := 1;
  dst_offset  NUMBER := 1;
  src_osin    NUMBER;
  dst_osin    NUMBER;
  bytes_rd    NUMBER;
  bytes_wt    NUMBER; 
BEGIN
  SELECT p2 INTO dst_loc FROM p 
      WHERE p where p1 = 20;

  /* Opening the source BFILE is mandatory */
  dbms_lob.fileopen(src_loc, dbms_lob.file_readonly);

  /* Opening the LOB is optional */
  dbms_lob.OPEN(dst_loc, dbms_lob.lob_readwrite);
  /* Save the input source/destination offsets */
  src_osin := src_offset;
  dst_osin := dst_offset;
  /* Use LOBMAXSIZE to indicate loading the entire BFILE */
  dbms_lob.LOADBLOBFROMFILE(dst_loc,src_loc,dbms_lob.lobmaxsize,src_offset,dst_
offset) ;

  /* Closing the LOB is mandatory if you have opened it */
  dbms_lob.close(dst_loc);
  dbms_lob.filecloseall();
  COMMIT;
```
