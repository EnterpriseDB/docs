title: "LOADBLOBFROMFILE"
---

The `LOADBLOBFROMFILE` procedure loads data from a BFILE to a BLOB.

```sql
LOADBLOBFROMFILE (<dest_lob> IN OUT BLOB, <src_file> IN BFILE, 
   <amount> IN NUMBER, <dest_offset> IN OUT NUMBER, 
   <src_offset> IN OUT NUMBER)
```

## Parameters

`dest_lob`

Locator of the BLOB where data will be loaded.

`src_bfile`

Locator of the BFILE that is the source to be loaded.

`amount`

Number of bytes to load from the BFILE.

`dest_offset`

- IN&mdash;The byte offset in the destination BLOB that specifies where the write begins. (Origin is considered to be 1.) 

- OUT&mdash;The byte offset in the destination BLOB that specifies where the write ends. The next write begins at that same location.

`src_offset`

- IN&mdash;The byte offset in the source BFILE that specifies where the read begins. (Origin is considered to be 1.) 

- OUT&mdash;The byte offset in the source BFILE that specifies where the read ends. The next read begins at that same location.


## Example

``` sql
DECLARE
  src_loc     bfile := BFILENAME('ANOTHER_DIR', 'a.txt');
  dst_loc     BLOB;
  src_offset  NUMBER := 1;
  dst_offset  NUMBER := 1;
  amt         NUMBER := dbms_lob.lobmaxsize;
BEGIN
  /* Opening the source BFILE is mandatory */
     DBMS_LOB.OPEN(src_loc, DBMS_LOB.LOB_READONLY);
  /* Use LOBMAXSIZE to indicate loading the entire BFILE */
  DBMS_LOB.LOADBLOBFROMFILE(dst_loc,src_loc,amt,src_offset,dst_offset) ;

   /* Close the BFILE: */
   DBMS_LOB.FILECLOSE(src_loc);

  COMMIT;
END;
