title: "SQL_OBJECT_NAME"
---

The `SQL_OBJECT_NAME` procedure determines whether a string is a valid SQL identifier for a SQL object. An error occurs if a SQL object does not exist.

The object can be a partition or subpartition or a database name. Here is the sequence used to validate an object:

1. Table, view, materialized view, index, sequence, foreign table, partition-table, type, object type
1. Function, procedure, aggregate, routine
1. Packages
1. Synonym
1. Trigger
1. Queue, queue table
1. Event trigger

The procedure does not validate sub-objects such as columns or package members. 

For example, if the name is `table_name.column_name`, the procedure validates the `table_name` by searching through table names in the search path. After finding the table name, the procedure validates the basic syntax of `column_name`. Similarly, in the case of `package_name.member_name`, after the procedure finds the package name in the search path, it only validates the basic syntax of `member_name`.

```sql
SQL_OBJECT_NAME(
  <str> VARCHAR2 CHARACTER SET ANY_CS)
RETURN VARCHAR2 CHARACTER SET str%CHARSET;
```

## Parameters

`str`

 The input string.
