EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports developing and running applications compatible with PostgreSQL and Oracle. You can alter some system behaviors to act in a more PostgreSQL- or in a more Oracle-compliant manner. You control these behaviors by using configuration parameters. 

-   `edb_redwood_date` &mdash; Controls whether or not a time component is stored in `DATE` columns. For behavior compatible with Oracle databases, set `edb_redwood_date` to `TRUE`. 
-   `edb_redwood_raw_names` &mdash; Controls whether database object names appear in uppercase or lowercase letters when viewed from Oracle system catalogs. For behavior compatible with Oracle databases, `edb_redwood_raw_names` is set to its default value of `FALSE`. To view database object names as they are actually stored in the PostgreSQL system catalogs, set `edb_redwood_raw_names` to `TRUE`. 
-   `edb_redwood_strings` &mdash; Equates `NULL` to an empty string for purposes of string concatenation operations. For behavior compatible with Oracle databases, set `edb_redwood_strings` to `TRUE`. 
-   `edb_stmt_level_tx` &mdash; Isolates automatic rollback of an aborted SQL command to statement level rollback only â€“ the entire, current transaction is not automatically rolled back as is the case for default PostgreSQL behavior. For behavior compatible with Oracle databases, set `edb_stmt_level_tx` to `TRUE`; however, use only when absolutely necessary. 
-   `oracle_home` &mdash; Point EDB Postgres Advanced Server to the correct Oracle installation directory. 

See [Configuration parameters compatible with Oracle databases](../database_administrator_reference/01_introduction/) for access to more detailed information.
