EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports many SQL commands compatible with Oracle databases. These SQL commands work on both an Oracle database and an EDB Postgres Advanced Server database.

EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports additional commands not described here. These commands might not have an Oracle equivalent, or they might provide the similar or same functionality as an Oracle SQL command but with different syntax.

The SQL commands that follow don't necessarily represent the full syntax, options, and functionality available for each command. In most cases, syntax, options, and functionality that aren't compatible with Oracle databases aren't included in the command description and syntax.

Command functionality that isn't compatible with Oracle databases is noted.
