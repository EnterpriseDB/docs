## Name

`COMMENT` &mdash; Define or change the comment of an object.

## Synopsis

```sql
COMMENT ON
{
  TABLE <table_name> |
  COLUMN <table_name.column_name>
} IS '<text>'
```

## Description

`COMMENT` stores a comment about a database object. To modify a comment, issue a new `COMMENT` command for the same object. Only one comment string is stored for each object. To remove a comment, specify an empty string (two consecutive single quotes with no intervening space) for `text`. Comments are dropped when the object is dropped.

## Parameters

`table_name`

 The name of the table (optionally schema-qualified) to comment. 

`table_name.column_name`

 The name of a column (optionally schema-qualified) in `table_name` to comment. 

`text`

 The new comment.

## Notes

There is currently no security mechanism for comments. Any user connected to a database can see all the comments for objects in that database, although only superusers can change comments for objects that they don’t own. Don't put security-critical information in a comment.

## Examples

Attach a comment to the table `emp`:

```sql
COMMENT ON TABLE emp IS 'Current employee information';
```

Attach a comment to the `empno` column of the `emp` table:

```sql
COMMENT ON COLUMN emp.empno IS 'Employee identification number';
```

Remove these comments:

```sql
COMMENT ON TABLE emp IS '';
COMMENT ON COLUMN emp.empno IS '';
```
