## Name

`ALTER TABLE` &mdash; Change the definition of a table.

## Synopsis

```sql
ALTER TABLE <name>
  action [, ...]
ALTER TABLE <name>
  RENAME COLUMN <column> TO <new_column>
ALTER TABLE <name>
  RENAME TO <new_name>
ALTER TABLE <name>
  { NOPARALLEL | PARALLEL [ <integer> ] }
```

`action` is one of:

```sql
ADD <column type> [ <column_constraint> [ ... ] ]
DROP COLUMN <column>
ADD <table_constraint>
DROP CONSTRAINT <constraint_name> [ CASCADE ]
```

## Description

`ALTER TABLE` changes the definition of an existing table. There are several subforms:

-   `ADD column type`

    This form adds a column to the table using the same syntax as `CREATE TABLE`.

-   `DROP COLUMN`

    This form drops a column from a table. Indexes and table constraints involving the column are dropped as well.

-   `ADD table_constraint`

    This form adds a constraint to a table. For details, see [CREATE TABLE](36_create_table/#create_table).

-   `DROP CONSTRAINT`

    This form drops constraints on a table. Currently, constraints on tables don't need unique names, so there might be more than one constraint matching the specified name. All matching constraints are dropped.

`RENAME`

 The `RENAME` forms change the name of a table (or an index, sequence, or view) or the name of a column in a table. There is no effect on the stored data.

The `PARALLEL` clause sets the degree of parallelism for a table. The `NOPARALLEL` clause resets the values to their defaults. `reloptions` shows the `parallel_workers` parameter as `0`.

A superuser has permission to create a trigger on any user's table, but a user can create a trigger only on the table they own. However, when the ownership of a table is changed, the ownership of the trigger's implicit objects is updated when they're matched with a table owner owning a trigger.

You can use the `ALTER TRIGGER ...ON AUTHORIZATION` command to alter a trigger's implicit object owner. For information, see [ALTER TRIGGER](13_alter_trigger/#alter_trigger).

You must own the table to use `ALTER TABLE`.

## Parameters

`name`

 The name (possibly schema-qualified) of an existing table to alter.

`column`

 Name of a new or existing column.

`new_column`

 New name for an existing column.

`new_name`

 New name for the table.

`type`

 Data type of the new column.

`table_constraint`

 New table constraint for the table.

`constraint_name`

 Name of an existing constraint to drop.

`CASCADE`

 Automatically drop objects that depend on the dropped constraint.

`PARALLEL`

 Specify `PARALLEL` to select a degree of parallelism. You can also specify the degree of parallelism by setting the `parallel_workers` parameter when performing a parallel scan on a table. If you specify `PARALLEL` without including a degree of parallelism, the index uses default parallelism.

`NOPARALLEL`

 Specify `NOPARALLEL` to reset parallelism to default values.

`integer`

 The `integer` indicates the degree of parallelism, which is the number of `parallel_workers` used in the parallel operation to perform a parallel scan on a table.

## Notes

When you invoke `ADD COLUMN`, all existing rows in the table are initialized with the column’s default value (null if no `DEFAULT` clause is specified). Adding a column with a non-null default requires rewriting the entire table. This can take a long time for a large table, and it temporarily requires double the disk space. Adding a `CHECK` or `NOT NULL` constraint requires scanning the table to verify that existing rows meet the constraint.

The `DROP COLUMN` form doesn't physically remove the column but makes it invisible to SQL operations. Subsequent insert and update operations in the table store a null value for the column. Thus, dropping a column is quick, but it doesn't immediately reduce the on-disk size of your table since the space occupied by the dropped column isn't reclaimed. The space is reclaimed over time as existing rows are updated.

Changing any part of a system catalog table isn't permitted. Refer to [CREATE TABLE](36_create_table/#create_table) for a further description of valid parameters.

## Examples

To add a column of type `VARCHAR2` to a table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE emp ADD address VARCHAR2(30);
```

To drop a column from a table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE emp DROP COLUMN address;
```

To rename an existing column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE emp RENAME COLUMN address TO city;
```

To rename an existing table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE emp RENAME TO employee;
```

To add a check constraint to a table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE emp ADD CONSTRAINT sal_chk CHECK (sal > 500);
```

To remove a check constraint from a table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE emp DROP CONSTRAINT sal_chk;
```

To reset the degree of parallelism to 0 on the `emp` table:

```sql
ALTER TABLE emp NOPARALLEL;
```

This example creates a table named `dept` and then alters the `dept` table to define and enable a unique key on the `dname` column. The constraint `dept_dname_uq` identifies the `dname` column as a unique key. The `USING_INDEX` clause creates an index on a table `dept` with the index statement specified to enable the unique constraint.

```sql
CREATE TABLE dept (
   deptno          NUMBER(2),
   dname           VARCHAR2(14),
   loc             VARCHAR2(13)
);
```

```sql
ALTER TABLE dept
  ADD CONSTRAINT dept_dname_uq UNIQUE(dname)
     USING INDEX (CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_dept_dname_uq ON dept (dname));
```

This example creates a table named `emp` and then alters the `emp` table to define and enable a primary key on the `ename` column. The `emp_ename_pk` constraint identifies the column `ename` as a primary key of the `emp` table. The `USING_INDEX` clause creates an index on a table `emp` with the index statement specified to enable the primary constraint.

```sql
CREATE TABLE emp (
   empno           NUMBER(4) NOT NULL,
   ename           VARCHAR2(10),
   job             VARCHAR2(9),
   sal             NUMBER(7,2),
   deptno          NUMBER(2)
);
```

```sql
ALTER TABLE emp
  ADD CONSTRAINT emp_ename_pk PRIMARY KEY (ename)
     USING INDEX (CREATE INDEX idx_emp_ename_pk ON emp (ename));
```
