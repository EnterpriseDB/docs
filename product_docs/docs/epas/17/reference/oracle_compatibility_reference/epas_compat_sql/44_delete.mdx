## Name

`DELETE` &mdash; Delete rows of a table.

## Synopsis

```text
DELETE [ <optimizer_hint> ] [ FROM ] <table>[@<dblink> ]
  [ WHERE <condition> ]
  [ RETURNING <return_expression> [, ...]
      { INTO { <record> | <variable> [, ...] }
      | BULK COLLECT INTO <collection> [, ...] } ]
```

## Description

`DELETE` deletes rows that satisfy the `WHERE` clause from the specified table. Omitting the `WHERE` clause deletes all rows in the table, leaving an empty table. You need the `DELETE` privilege on the table to delete from it. You also need the `SELECT` privilege for any table whose values are read in the condition.

The `FROM` keyword is optional if EDB Postgres Advanced Server is installed in Oracle-compatible mode. It's required if EDB Postgres Advanced Server is installed in Postgres mode.

!!! Note
    The `TRUNCATE` command is a faster way to remove all rows from a table.

You can specify the `RETURNING INTO { record | variable [, ...] }` clause only if you use the `DELETE` command in an SPL program. The result set of the `DELETE` command can't include more than one row. If it does, an error occurs. If the result set is empty, then the contents of the target record or variables are set to null.

You can specify the `RETURNING BULK COLLECT INTO collection [, ...]` clause only if you use the `DELETE` command in an SPL program. If you specify more than one `collection` as the target of the `BULK COLLECT INTO` clause, then each `collection` must consist of a single, scalar field. That is, `collection` can't be a record. 

The result set of the `DELETE` command can contain zero, one, or more rows. The `return_expression` evaluated for each row of the result set becomes an element in `collection`, starting with the first element. Any existing rows in `collection` are deleted. If the result set is empty, then `collection` is empty.

## Parameters

`optimizer_hint`

 Comment-embedded hints to the optimizer for selecting an execution plan.

`table`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing table.

`dblink`

 Database link name identifying a remote database. For more information, see [`CREATE DATABASE LINK`](21_create_public_database_link).

`condition`

 A value expression that returns a value of type `BOOLEAN` that determines the rows to delete.

`return_expression`

 An expression that can include one or more columns from `table`. If you specify a column name from `table`  in `return_expression`, the value substituted for the column when `return_expression` is evaluated is the value from the deleted row.

`record`

 A record whose field to assign the evaluated `return_expression`. The first `return_expression` is assigned to the first field in `record`, the second `return_expression` is assigned to the second field in `record`, and so on. The number of fields in `record` must exactly match the number of expressions, and the fields must be type-compatible with their assigned expressions.

`variable`

 A variable to which to assign the evaluated `return_expression`. If you specify more than one `return_expression` and `variable`, the `first return_expression` is assigned to the first `variable`, the second `return_expression` is assigned to the second `variable`, and so on. The number of variables specified following the `INTO` keyword must exactly match the number of expressions following the `RETURNING` keyword, and the variables must be type-compatible with their assigned expressions.

`collection`

 A collection in which an element is created from the evaluated `return_expression`. You can have a single collection, which can be a collection of a single field or a collection of a record type. Alternatively, you can have more than one collection. In that case, each collection must consist of a single field. The number of return expressions must match in number and order the number of fields in all specified collections. Each corresponding `return_expression` and `collection` field must be type-compatible.

## Examples

Delete all rows for employee `7900` from the `jobhist` table:

```sql
DELETE FROM jobhist WHERE empno = 7900;
```

Clear the table `jobhist`:

```sql
DELETE FROM jobhist;
```
