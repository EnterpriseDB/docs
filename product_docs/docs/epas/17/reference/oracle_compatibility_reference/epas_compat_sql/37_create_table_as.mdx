## Name

`CREATE TABLE AS` &mdash; Define a new table from the results of a query.

## Synopsis

```sql
CREATE [ GLOBAL TEMPORARY ] TABLE <table_name>
  [ (<column_name> [, ...] ) ]
  [ ON COMMIT { PRESERVE ROWS | DELETE ROWS } ]
  [ TABLESPACE tablespace ]
  AS <query>
```

## Description

`CREATE TABLE AS` creates a table and fills it with data computed by a `SELECT` command. The table columns have the names and data types associated with the output columns of the `SELECT`. You can override the column names by providing an explicit list of new column names.

`CREATE TABLE AS` is similar to creating a view. However, it differs because it creates a table and evaluates the query once to fill the new table initially. The new table doesn't track later changes to the source tables of the query. In contrast, a view reevaluates its defining `SELECT` statement whenever you query it.

## Parameters

`GLOBAL TEMPORARY`

 Specify to create the table as a temporary table. For details, see [`CREATE TABLE`](36_create_table/).

`table_name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table to create.

`column_name`

 The name of a column in the new table. If you don't provide column names, the names are taken from the output column names of the query.

`query`

 A query statement (a `SELECT` command). For a description of the allowed syntax, see [`SELECT`](71_select/).
