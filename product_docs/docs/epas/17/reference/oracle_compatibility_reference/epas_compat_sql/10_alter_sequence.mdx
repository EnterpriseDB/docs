## Name

`ALTER SEQUENCE` &mdash; Change the definition of a sequence generator.

## Synopsis

```sql
ALTER SEQUENCE <name> [ INCREMENT BY <increment> ]
  [ MINVALUE <minvalue> ] [ MAXVALUE <maxvalue> ]
  [ CACHE <cache> | NOCACHE ] [ CYCLE ]
```

## Description

`ALTER SEQUENCE` changes the parameters of an existing sequence generator. Any parameter not specifically set in the `ALTER SEQUENCE` command retains its prior setting.

## Parameters

`name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a sequence to alter.

`increment`

 The clause `INCREMENT BY increment` is optional. A positive value makes an ascending sequence, a negative one a descending sequence. If unspecified, the old increment value is maintained.

`minvalue`

 The optional clause `MINVALUE minvalue` determines the minimum value a sequence can generate. If not specified, the current minimum value is maintained. You can use the keywords `NO MINVALUE` to set this behavior back to the defaults of 1 and -2<sup>63</sup>-1 for ascending and descending sequences, respectively. However, this term isn't compatible with Oracle databases.

`maxvalue`

 The optional clause `MAXVALUE maxvalue` determines the maximum value for the sequence. If not specified, the current maximum value is maintained. You can use the keywords `NO MAXVALUE` to set this behavior back to the defaults of 2<sup>63</sup>-1 and -1 for ascending and descending sequences, respectively. However, this term isn't compatible with Oracle databases.

`cache`

 The optional clause `CACHE cache` specifies how many sequence numbers to preallocate and store in memory for faster access. The minimum value is `1`. Only one value can be generated at a time, i.e., `NOCACHE`. If unspecified, the old cache value is maintained.

`CYCLE`

 The `CYCLE` option allows the sequence to wrap around when the `maxvalue` or `minvalue` is reached by an ascending or descending sequence. If the limit is reached, the next number generated is the `minvalue` or `maxvalue`. If not specified, the old cycle behavior is maintained. You can use the keywords `NO CYCLE` to alter the sequence so that it doesn't recycle. However, this term isn't compatible with Oracle databases.

## Notes

To avoid blocking concurrent transactions that obtain numbers from the same sequence, `ALTER SEQUENCE` is never rolled back. The changes take effect immediately and aren't reversible.

`ALTER SEQUENCE` doesn't immediately affect `NEXTVAL` results in backends, other than the current one, that have preallocated (cached) sequence values. They use up all cached values prior to noticing the changed sequence parameters. The current backend is affected immediately.

## Examples

Change the increment and cache values of the sequence `serial`:

```sql
ALTER SEQUENCE serial INCREMENT BY 2 CACHE 5;
```
