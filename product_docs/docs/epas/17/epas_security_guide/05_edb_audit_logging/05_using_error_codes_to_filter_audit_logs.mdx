<div id="using_error_codes_to_filter_audit_logs" class="registered_link"></div>

EDB Postgres Advanced Server includes an extension that you can use to exclude from the EDB Postgres Advanced Server log files entries that include a user-specified error code. To filter audit log entries, you must first enable the extension by modifying the `postgresql.conf` file. Add the following value to those specified in the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter:

```text
$libdir/edb_filter_log
```

Then, use the `edb_filter_log.errcodes` parameter to specify any error codes you want to omit from the log files:

```ini
edb_filter_log.errcode = 'error_code'
```

Where `error_code` specifies one or more error codes that you want to omit from the log file. Provide multiple error codes in a comma-delimited list.

For example, if `edb_filter_log` is enabled, and `edb_filter_log.errcode` is set to `'23505,23502,22012'`, any log entries that return one of the following `SQLSTATE` errors are omitted from the log file:

- `23505` (for violating a unique constraint)

- `23502` (for violating a not-null constraint)

- `22012` (for dividing by zero)

For a complete list of the error codes supported by EDB Postgres Advanced Server audit log filtering, see the [Postgres core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/errcodes-appendix.html).
