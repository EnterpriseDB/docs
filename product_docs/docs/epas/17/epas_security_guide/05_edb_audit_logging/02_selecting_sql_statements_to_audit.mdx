<div id="selecting_sql_statements_to_audit" class="registered_link"></div>

The `edb_audit_statement` permits inclusion of one or more comma-separated values to control the SQL statements to audit. The following is the general format:

```ini
edb_audit_statement = 'value_1[, value_2]...'
```

The comma-separated values can include or omit space characters following the comma. You can specify the values in any combination of lowercase or uppercase letters.

## Overview of the parameters

The basic parameter values are the following:

-   `all` &mdash; Audit and log every statement including any error messages on statements.
-   `none` &mdash; Disable all auditing and logging. A value of `none` overrides any other value included in the list.
-   `ddl` &mdash; Audit all data definition language (DDL) statements (`CREATE`, `ALTER`, and `DROP`) as well as `GRANT` and `REVOKE` data control language (DCL) statements.
-   `dml` &mdash; Audit all data manipulation language (DML) statements (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `TRUNCATE`).
-   `select` &mdash; Audit `SELECT` statements.
-   `set` &mdash; Audit `SET` statements.
-   `rollback` &mdash; Audit `ROLLBACK` statements.
-   `error` &mdash; Log all error messages that occur. Otherwise, no messages about errors that occur on SQL statements related to any of the other preceding parameter values are logged except when `all` is used.
-   `{ select | update | delete | insert }@groupname` &mdash; Selectively audit objects for specific DML statements (`SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `INSERT`) including `(@)` and excluding `(-)` groups on a given table. For more information, see [Object auditing](09_object_auditing).

[DDL and DCL statements](#ddl-and-dcl-statements) describes additional parameter values for selecting particular DDL or DCL statements for auditing. [DML statements](#dml-statements) describes additional parameter values for selecting particular DML statements for auditing.

If an unsupported value is included in the `edb_audit_statement` parameter, then an error occurs when applying the setting to the database server. See the database server log file for the error such as in the following example in which `create materialized vw` results in the error. The correct value is `create materialized view`.

```text
2017-07-16 11:20:39 EDT LOG:  invalid value for parameter
"edb_audit_statement": "create materialized vw, create sequence, grant"
2017-07-16 11:20:39 EDT FATAL:  configuration file "/var/lib/edb/as16/data/
postgresql.conf" contains errors
```

## DDL and DCL statements

When auditing DDL and DCL statements, the following general rules apply to the values that can be included in the `edb_audit_statement` parameter:

-   If the `edb_audit_statement` parameter includes `ddl` or `all`, then all DDL statements are audited. In addition, the DCL statements `GRANT` and `REVOKE` are audited.
-   If the `edb_audit_statement` is set to `none`, then no DDL nor DCL statements are audited.
-   You can choose specific types of DDL and DCL statements for auditing by including a combination of values in the `edb_audit_statement` parameter.

Use the following syntax to specify an `edb_audit_statement` parameter value for DDL statements:

```text
{ create | alter | drop } [ <object_type> ]
```

`object_type` is any of the following:

 -  `ACCESS METHOD`

 -  `AGGREGATE`

 -  `CAST`

 -  `COLLATION`

 -  `CONVERSION`

 -  `DATABASE`

 -  `EVENT TRIGGER`

 -  `EXTENSION`

 -  `FOREIGN TABLE`

 -  `FUNCTION`

 -  `INDEX`

 -  `LANGUAGE`

 -  `LARGE OBJECT`

 -  `MATERIALIZED VIEW`

 -  `OPERATOR`

 -  `OPERATOR CLASS`

 -  `OPERATOR FAMILY`

 -  `POLICY`

 -  `PUBLICATION`

 -  `ROLE`

 -  `RULE`

 -  `SCHEMA`

 -  `SEQUENCE`

 -  `SERVER`

 -  `SUBSCRIPTION`

 -  `TABLE`

 -  `TABLESPACE`

 -  `TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION`

 -  `TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY`

 -  `TEXT SEARCH PARSER`

 -  `TEXT SEARCH TEMPLATE`

 -  `TRANSFORM`

 -  `TRIGGER`

 -  `TYPE`

 -  `USER MAPPING`

 -  `VIEW`

Descriptions of object types as used in SQL commands can be found in the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-commands.html).

If `object_type` is omitted from the parameter value, then all of the specified command statements (`create`, `alter`, or `drop`) are audited.

Use the following syntax to specify an `edb_audit_statement` parameter value for DCL statements:

```text
{ grant | revoke }
```

### Examples

In this example, `edb_audit_connect` and `edb_audit_statement` are set with the following non-default values:

```ini
logging_collector = 'on'
edb_audit_connect = 'all'
edb_audit_statement = 'create, alter, error'
```

Thus, only SQL statements invoked by the `CREATE` and `ALTER` commands are audited. Error messages are also included in the audit log.

The following is the database session that occurs:

```sql
$ psql edb enterprisedb
Password for user enterprisedb:
psql.bin (16.1.0)
Type "help" for help.

edb=# SHOW edb_audit_connect;

```
```sql

```
```sql

auditdb(#  loc             VARCHAR2(13)
auditdb(# );
CREATE TABLE
```

The resulting audit log file contains the following. (Each audit log entry was split and displays across multiple lines. A blank line was inserted between the audit log entries for visual clarity.)

The `CREATE` and `ALTER` statements for the `adminuser` role and `auditdb` database are audited. Because `error` is included in the `edb_audit_statement` parameter, the error for the `ALTER ROLE adminuser` statement is also logged.

Similarly, the `CREATE` statements for schema `edb` and tables `department` and `dept` are audited.

There's no `edb_audit_statement` setting that results in auditing successfully processed `DROP` statements such as `ddl`, `all`, or `drop`. Thus the `DROP TABLE department` statement isn't in the audit log. 

In this example, `edb_audit_connect` and `edb_audit_statement` are set with the following non-default values:

```ini
logging_collector = 'on'
edb_audit_connect = 'all'
edb_audit_statement = 'create view,create materialized view,create sequence,grant'
```

Thus, only SQL statements invoked by the `CREATE VIEW`, `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW`, `CREATE SEQUENCE` and `GRANT` commands are audited.

The following is the database session that occurs:

```sql
$ psql auditdb adminuser
Password for user adminuser:
psql.bin (16.1.0)
Type "help" for help.

auditdb=# SHOW edb_audit_connect;

```
```sql

```
```sql
auditdb=# SET search_path TO edb;

auditdb=# CREATE TABLE emp (
auditdb(#   empno           NUMBER(4) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT emp_pk PRIMARY KEY,
auditdb(#   ename           VARCHAR2(10),
auditdb(#   job             VARCHAR2(9),
auditdb(#   mgr             NUMBER(4),

```

The `CREATE VIEW` and `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` statements are audited. The prior `CREATE TABLE emp` statement isn't audited because none of the values `create`, `create table`, `ddl`, nor `all` are included in the `edb_audit_statement` parameter.

The `CREATE SEQUENCE` and `GRANT` statements are audited because those values are included in the `edb_audit_statement` parameter.

In this example, `edb_audit_connect` and `edb_audit_statement` are set with the following non-default values:

```ini
logging_collector = 'on'
edb_audit_connect = 'all'
edb_audit_statement = 'none'
```

The session for users who connect as `ADMIN` or `SYSDBA` can be fully audited. An admin user is connected to a database `auditdb` as `ADMINUSER`. The following `ALTER USER` command specifies to audit `ADMINUSER`.

```sql
ALTER USER adminuser SET edb_audit_statement = "all";
```

Setting the `edb_audit_statement` parameter to `all` allows auditing of all of the SQL statements for an admin user.

The following is the database session that occurs:

```sql
$ psql auditdb adminuser
Password for user adminuser:
psql.bin (16.1.0)
Type "help" for help.

auditdb=# SHOW edb_audit_connect;

The audit session for a user `carol` can be fully blocked by the database administrators using the `ALTER USER` command:

```sql
ALTER USER carol SET edb_audit_statement = "none";
```

!!! Note
    The database administrator can allow a specific user to audit any SQL statements by specifying the `ALTER USER` command and setting the `edb_audit_statement` parameter to any value.
    
The following is the database session that occurs:

```sql
$ psql auditdb carol
Password for user carol:
psql.bin (16.1.0)
Type "help" for help.

auditdb=# SHOW edb_audit_connect;
__OUTPUT__
 edb_audit_connect
-------------------
 all
(1 row)
```
```sql
auditdb=# SHOW edb_audit_statement;
__OUTPUT__
 edb_audit_statement 
---------------------
 none
(1 row)
```
```sql
auditdb=# SET search_path TO edb;
SET
auditdb=> CREATE TABLE salgrade
auditdb->         (grade NUMBER,
auditdb(>          losal NUMBER,
auditdb(>          hisal NUMBER);
CREATE TABLE
INSERT INTO salgrade VALUES (1,  700, 1200);
INSERT INTO salgrade VALUES (2, 1201, 1400);
INSERT INTO salgrade VALUES (3, 1401, 2000);
```

The resulting audit log file contains only the connection authentication information. Setting the `edb_audit_statement` parameter to `none` doesn't allow the auditing of SQL statements for `carol`, so no audit logs are generated.

(Each audit log entry was split and displays across multiple lines. A blank line was inserted between the audit log entries for visual clarity.)

## DML statements

When auditing DML statements, the following general rules apply to the values that can be included in the `edb_audit_statement` parameter:

-   If the `edb_audit_statement` parameter includes `dml` or `all`, then all DML statements are audited.
-   If the `edb_audit_statement` is set to `none`, then no DML statements are audited.
-   You can choose specific types of DML statements for auditing by including a combination of values in the `edb_audit_statement` parameter.

Use the following syntax to specify an `edb_audit_statement` parameter value for `SQL INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `TRUNCATE` statements:

```text
{ insert | update | delete | truncate }
```

### Example

In this example, `edb_audit_connect` and `edb_audit_statement` are set with the following non-default values:

```ini
logging_collector = 'on'
edb_audit_connect = 'all'
edb_audit_statement = 'UPDATE, DELETE, error'
```

Thus, only SQL statements invoked by the `UPDATE` and `DELETE` commands are audited. All errors are also included in the audit log, including errors not related to the `UPDATE` and `DELETE` commands.

The following is the database session that occurs:

```sql
$ psql auditdb adminuser
Password for user adminuser:
psql.bin (16.1.0)
Type "help" for help.

auditdb=# SHOW edb_audit_connect;
__OUTPUT__
 edb_audit_connect
-------------------
 all
(1 row)
```
```sql
auditdb=# SHOW edb_audit_statement;
__OUTPUT__
 edb_audit_statement
-----------------------
 UPDATE, DELETE, error
(1 row)
```
```sql
auditdb=# SET search_path TO edb;
SET
auditdb=# INSERT INTO dept VALUES (10,'ACCOUNTING','NEW YORK');
INSERT 0 1
auditdb=# INSERT INTO dept VALUES (20,'RESEARCH','DALLAS');
INSERT 0 1
auditdb=# INSERT INTO dept VALUES (30,'SALES','CHICAGO');

auditdb=# INSERT INTO emp VALUES (7499,'ALLEN','SALESMAN',7698,'20-FEB-81',1600,300,30);
INSERT 0 1
auditdb=# INSERT INTO emp VALUES (7521,'WARD','SALESMAN',7698,'22-FEB-81',1250,500,30);
INSERT 0 1
                 .
                 .
                 .
auditdb=# INSERT INTO emp VALUES (7934,'MILLER','CLERK',7782,'23-JAN-82',1300,NULL,10);
INSERT 0 1
auditdb=# UPDATE dept SET loc = 'BEDFORD' WHERE deptno = 40;
UPDATE 1
auditdb=# SELECT * FROM dept;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
     40 | OPERATIONS | BEDFORD
(4 rows)
```
```sql
auditdb=# DELETE FROM emp WHERE deptno = 10;
DELETE 3
auditdb=# TRUNCATE employee;
ERROR:  relation "employee" does not exist
auditdb=# TRUNCATE emp;
TRUNCATE TABLE
auditdb=# \q
```

The resulting audit log file contains the following. (Each audit log entry was split and displays across multiple lines. A blank line was inserted between the audit log entries for visual clarity.)

```

The `UPDATE dept` and `DELETE FROM emp` statements are audited. All of the prior `INSERT` statements aren't audited because the values `insert`, `dml`, or `all` aren't included in the `edb_audit_statement` parameter.

The `SELECT * FROM dept` statement isn't audited because `select` and `all` aren't included in the `edb_audit_statement` parameter.

Because `error` is specified in the `edb_audit_statement` parameter but not the `truncate` value, the error on the `TRUNCATE employee` statement is logged in the audit file. But the successful `TRUNCATE emp` statement isn't.
