<div id="backing_up_profile_management_functions" class="registered_link"></div>

A profile can include a `PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION` clause that refers to a user-defined function that specifies the behavior enforced by EDB Postgres Advanced Server. Profiles are global objects. They are shared by all of the databases in a cluster. While profiles are global objects, user-defined functions are database objects.

Invoking `pg_dumpall` with the `–g` or `–r` option creates a script that re-creates the definition of any existing profiles but that doesn't re-create the user-defined functions that are referred to by the `PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION` clause. Use the `pg_dump` utility to explicitly dump, and later restore, the database in which those functions reside.

The script created by `pg_dump` contains a command that includes the clause and function name to associate the restored function with the profile with which it was previously associated:

```sql
ALTER PROFILE… LIMIT PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION <function_name>
```

If the `PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION` clause is set to `DEFAULT` or `NULL`, the behavior is replicated by the script generated by the `pg_dumpall –g` or `pg_dumpall –r` command.
