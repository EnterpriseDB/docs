EDB has enhanced ECPG (the PostgreSQL precompiler) to create ECPGPlus. ECPGPlus allows you to include embedded SQL commands in C applications. When you use ECPGPlus to compile an application that contains embedded SQL commands, the SQL code is syntax checked and translated into C.

See [ECPGPlus overview](../application_programming/ecpgplus_guide/02_overview/) for details about installing and configuring the utility.
