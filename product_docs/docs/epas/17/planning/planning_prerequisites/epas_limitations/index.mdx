The following limitations apply when implementing EDB Postgres Advanced Server:

-   EDB recommends you don't store the `data` directory of a production database on an NFS file system. If you plan to go against this recommendation, see the [19.2.2.1. NFS](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/creating-cluster.html#CREATING-CLUSTER-FILESYSTEM) section in the PostgreSQL documentation for guidance about configuration.
-   The LLVM JIT package is supported only on RHEL x86.
