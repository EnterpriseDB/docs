## Reviewing the reports

To use Dynamic Runtime Instrumentation Tools Architecture (DRITA) reports for performance tuning, review the top five events in a report. Look for any event that takes an especially large percentage of resources. In a streamlined system, user I/O generally makes up the largest number of waits. Evaluate waits in the context of CPU usage and total time. An event might not be significant if it takes two minutes out of a total measurement interval of two hours and the rest of the time is consumed by CPU time. Evaluate the component of response time (CPU "work" time or other "wait" time) that consumes the highest percentage of overall time.

When evaluating events, watch for:

| Event type                 | Description                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Checkpoint waits           | Checkpoint waits might indicate that checkpoint parameters need to be adjusted (`checkpoint_segments` and `checkpoint_timeout`). |
| WAL-related waits          | WAL-related waits might indicate `wal_buffers` are undersized.                                                                   |
| SQL Parse waits            | If the number of waits is high, try to use prepared statements.                                                                 |
| db file random reads       | If high, check for appropriate indexes and statistics.                                                                   |
| db file random writes      | If high, might need to decrease `bgwriter_delay`.                                                                                 |
| btree random lock acquires | Might indicate indexes are being rebuilt. Schedule index builds during less active time.                                          |

Also look at the hardware, the operating system, the network, and the application SQL statements in performance reviews.

## Event descriptions

The following table lists the basic wait events that are displayed by DRITA.

| `control file lock acquire`           | The server has waited for the short-term lock that synchronizes write access to the control file. This is usually a low number.                                                                            |

| `freespace lock acquire`              | The server has waited for the short-term lock that synchronizes access to the freespace map.                                                                                                                       |

| `tablespace create lock acquire`      | The server has waited for the short-term lock that prevents simultaneous `CREATE TABLESPACE` or `DROP TABLESPACE` commands.                                                                                        |
| `two phase state lock acquire`        | The server has waited for the short-term lock that synchronizes access to the list of prepared transactions.                                                                                                       |
| `wal insert lock acquire`             | The server has waited for the short-term lock that synchronizes write access to the write-ahead log. A high number can indicate that WAL buffers are sized too small.                                              |
| `wal write lock acquire`              | The server has waited for the short-term lock that synchronizes write-ahead log flushes.                                                                                                                           |
| `wal file sync`                       | The server has waited for the write-ahead log to sync to disk. This is related to the `wal_sync_method` parameter which, by default, is 'fsync'. You can gain better performance by changing this parameter to `open_sync`. |
| `wal flush`                           | The server has waited for the write-ahead log to flush to disk.                                                                                                                                                    |
| `wal write`                           | The server has waited for a write to the write-ahead log buffer. Expect this value to be high.                                                                                                                    |
| `xid gen lock acquire`                | The server has waited for the short-term lock that synchronizes access to the next available transaction ID.                                                                                                       |

## Wait events related to lightweight locks

When wait events occur for *lightweight locks*, DRITA displays them as well. It uses a lightweight lock to protect a particular data structure in shared memory.

Certain wait events can be due to the server process waiting for one of a group of related lightweight locks, which is referred to as a *lightweight lock tranche*. DRITA doesn't display individual lightweight lock tranches, but it displays their summation with a single event named `other lwlock acquire`.

For a list and description of lightweight locks displayed by DRITA, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-STATS-SETUP). Under [Viewing Statistics](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-STATS-VIEWS), see the Wait Event Type table for more details.

This example displays lightweight locks `ProcArrayLock`, `CLogControlLock`, `WALBufMappingLock`, and `XidGenLock`.

## Wait events related to product features

DRITA also displays wait events that are related to certain EDB Postgres Advanced Server product features. These events and the `other lwlock acquire` event are listed in the following table.
