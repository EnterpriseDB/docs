EDB Postgres Advanced Server's `postgresql.conf` file includes a configuration parameter named `timed_statistics` that controls collecting timing data. The valid parameter values are `TRUE` or `FALSE`. The default value is `FALSE`.

`timed_statistics` is a dynamic parameter that you can modify in the `postgresql.conf` file or while a session is in progress. To enable DRITA, you must either:

1.  Modify the `postgresql.conf` file, setting the `timed_statistics` parameter to `TRUE`.

2.  Connect to the server with the EDB-PSQL client and invoke the command:

   ```sql
   SET timed_statistics = TRUE
   ```

3. After modifying the `timed_statistics` parameter, take a starting snapshot. A snapshot captures the current state of each timer and event counter. The server compares the starting snapshot to a later snapshot to gauge system performance. Use the `edbsnap()` function to take the beginning snapshot:

   ```sql
   edb=# SELECT * FROM edbsnap();
   __OUTPUT__
       edbsnap
   ----------------------
    Statement processed.
   (1 row)
   ```

4. Run the workload that you want to evaluate. When the workload is complete or at a strategic point during the workload, take another snapshot:

   ```sql
   edb=# SELECT * FROM edbsnap();
   __OUTPUT__
       edbsnap
   ----------------------
    Statement processed.
   (1 row)
   ```

You can capture multiple snapshots during a session. Finally, you can use the DRITA functions and reports to manage and compare the snapshots to evaluate performance information.
