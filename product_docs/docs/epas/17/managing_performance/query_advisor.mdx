EDB Query Advisor is a Postgres extension that provides index recommendations by keeping statistics on predicates found in WHERE statements, JOIN clauses, and workload queries. It analyzes the cost-benefit to actual workload queries by replanning them with the hypothetical index. Hypothetical indexes are created based on the predicates collected from the workload queries.
