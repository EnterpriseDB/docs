title: Predefined roles
---

A set of predefined roles provides access to certain, commonly needed, privileged capabilities and information. Administrators including roles that have the CREATE ROLE privilege can GRANT these roles to users and/or other roles in their environment. The users/roles with these roles will have access to the specified capabilities and information.

For the complete list of the PostgreSQL's predefined roles, see [Predefined roles](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/17/predefined-roles.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation. 

The following table provides the predefined roles specific to EDB Postgres Advanced Server:
