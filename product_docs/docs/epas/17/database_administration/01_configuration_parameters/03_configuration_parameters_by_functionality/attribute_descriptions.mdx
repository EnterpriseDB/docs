title: "Description of parameter attributes"
---

The description of each group of parameters includes this list of attributes:

-   **Parameter type.** Type of values the parameter can accept. See [Setting configuration parameters](../01_setting_new_parameters/#setting_configuration_parameters) for a discussion of parameter type values.
-   **Default value.** Default setting if a value isn't explicitly set in the configuration file.
-   **Range.** Allowed range of values.
-   **Minimum scope of effect.** Smallest scope for which a distinct setting can be made. Generally, the minimal scope of a distinct setting is either:
    -  The entire cluster, meaning the setting is the same for all databases in the cluster and its sessions 
    -  `per session`, which means the setting might vary by role, database, or individual session. 
    This attribute has the same meaning as the `Scope of effect` column in the table of [Summary of configuration parameters](/epas/latest/reference/database_administrator_reference/02_summary_of_configuration_parameters/).
-   **When value changes take effect.** Least invasive action required to activate a change to a parameter’s value. All parameter setting changes made in the configuration file can be put into effect by restarting the database server. However, certain parameters require a database server `restart`. Some parameter setting changes can be put into effect with a `reload` of the configuration file without stopping the database server. Finally, other parameter setting changes can be put into effect with some client-side action whose result is `immediate`. This attribute has the same meaning as the `When takes effect` column in the table of [Summary of configuration parameters](/epas/latest/reference/database_administrator_reference/02_summary_of_configuration_parameters/).
-   **Required authorization to activate.** The type of user authorization to activate a change to a parameter’s setting. If a database server restart or a configuration file reload is required, then the user must be an EDB Postgres Advanced Server service account (`enterprisedb` or `postgres`, depending on the EDB Postgres Advanced Server compatibility installation mode). This attribute has the same meaning as the `Authorized user` column in the table of [Summary of configuration parameters](/epas/latest/reference/database_administrator_reference/02_summary_of_configuration_parameters/).
