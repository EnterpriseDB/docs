## EDB Clone Schema functions

The EDB Clone Schema functions are created in the `edb_util` schema when the `parallel_clone` and `edb_cloneschema` extensions are installed.

## Prerequisites

Verify the following conditions before using an EDB Clone Schema function:

-   You're connected to the target or local database as the database superuser defined in the `CREATE USER MAPPING` command for the foreign server of the target or local database.
-   The `edb_util` schema is in the search path, or invoke the cloning function with the `edb_util` prefix.
-   The target schema doesn't exist in the target database.
-   When using the remote copy functions, if the `on_tblspace` parameter is set to `true`, then the target database cluster contains all tablespaces that are referenced by objects in the source schema. Otherwise, creating the DDL statements for those database objects fails in the target schema, which causes a failure of the cloning process.
-   When using the remote copy functions, if you set the `copy_acls` parameter to `true`, then all roles that have `GRANT` privileges on objects in the source schema exist in the target database cluster. Otherwise granting privileges to those roles fails in the target schema, which causes a failure of the cloning process.
-   pgAgent is running against the target database if you're using the non-blocking form of the function.

EDB Postgres Advanced Server includes pgAgent as a component. For information about pgAgent, see the [pgAdmin documentation](https://www.pgadmin.org/docs/pgadmin4/dev/pgagent.html).

## Overview of the functions

Use the following functions with EDB Clone Schema:

-   `localcopyschema`. This function copies a schema and its database objects from a source database into the same database (the target) but with a different schema name from the original. Use this function when the source schema and the copy will reside within the same database. See [localcopyschema](copying_a_schema) for more information.
-   `localcopyschema_nb`. This function performs the same purpose as `localcopyschema` but as a background job, which frees up the terminal from which the function was initiated. This function is referred to as a *non-blocking* function. See [localcopyschema_nb](copying_a_schema) for more information.
-   `remotecopyschema`. This function copies a schema and its database objects from a source database to a different target database. Use this function when the source schema and the copy will reside in separate databases. The separate databases can reside in the same EDB Postgres Advanced Server database clusters or in different ones. See [remotecopyschema](copying_a_remote_schema) for more information.
-   `remotecopyschema_nb`. This function performs the same purpose as `remotecopyschema` but as a background job, which frees up the terminal from which the function was initiated. This function is a non-blocking function. See [remotecopyschema_nb](copying_a_remote_schema) for more information.
-   `process_status_from_log`. This function displays the status of the cloning functions. The information is obtained from a log file you specify when invoking a cloning function. See [process_status_from_log](checking_the_status) for more information.
-   `remove_log_file_and_job`. This function deletes the log file created by a cloning function. You can also use this function to delete a job created by the non-blocking form of the function. See [remove_log_file_and_job](performing_cleanup_tasks) for more information.

## List of supported database objects

You can clone these database objects from one schema to another:

-   Data types
-   Tables including partitioned tables, excluding foreign tables
-   Indexes
-   Constraints
-   Sequences
-   View definitions
-   Materialized views
-   Private synonyms
-   Table triggers, but excluding event triggers
-   Rules
-   Functions
-   Procedures
-   Packages
-   Comments for all supported object types
-   Access control lists (ACLs) for all supported object types

You can't clone the following database objects:

-   Large objects (Postgres `LOBs` and `BFILEs`)
-   Logical replication attributes for a table
-   Database links
-   Foreign data wrappers
-   Foreign tables
-   Event triggers
-   Extensions 

For cloning objects that rely on extensions, see the limitations that follow.

-   Row-level security
-   Policies
-   Operator class

## Limitations

The following limitations apply:

-   EDB Clone Schema is supported on EDB Postgres Advanced Server when you specify a dialect of **Compatible with Oracle** on the EDB Postgres Advanced Server Dialect dialog box during installation. It's also supported when you include the `--redwood-like` keywords during a text-mode installation or cluster initialization.
-   The source code in functions, procedures, triggers, packages, and so on, aren't modified after being copied to the target schema. If such programs contain coded references to objects with schema names, the programs might fail when invoked in the target schema if such schema names are no longer consistent in the target schema.
-   Cross-schema object dependencies aren't resolved. If an object in the target schema depends on an object in another schema, this dependency isn't resolved by the cloning functions.
-   For remote cloning, if an object in the source schema depends on an extension, then you must create this extension in the public schema of the remote database before invoking the remote cloning function.
-   At most, 16 copy jobs can run in parallel to clone schemas. Each job can have at most 16 worker processes to copy table data in parallel.
-   You can't cancel queries run by background workers.
