title: "CPU usage throttling"
description: "How to use EDB Resource Manager to control the CPU use of a resource group"
---

EDB Resource Manager uses *CPU throttling* to keep the aggregate CPU usage of all processes in the group within the limit specified by the `cpu_rate_limit` parameter. A process in the group might be interrupted and put into sleep mode for a short time to maintain the defined limit. When and how such interruptions occur is defined by a proprietary algorithm used by EDB Resource Manager.

To control CPU use of a resource group, set the `cpu_rate_limit` resource type parameter.

- Set the `cpu_rate_limit` parameter to the fraction of CPU time over wall-clock time to which the combined, simultaneous CPU usage of all processes in the group must not exceed. The value assigned to `cpu_rate_limit` is typically less than or equal to 1.

- On multicore systems, you can apply the `cpu_rate_limit` to more than one CPU core by setting it to greater than 1. For example, if `cpu_rate_limit` is set to 2.0, you use 100% of two CPUs. The valid range of the `cpu_rate_limit` parameter is 0 to 1.67772e+07. A setting of 0 means no CPU rate limit was set for the resource group.

- When the value is multiplied by 100, you can also interpret the `cpu_rate_limit` as the CPU usage percentage for a resource group.

## Setting the CPU rate limit for a resource group

Use the `ALTER RESOURCE GROUP` command with the `SET cpu_rate_limit` clause to set the CPU rate limit for a resource group.

In this example, the CPU usage limit is set to 50% for `resgrp_a`, 40% for `resgrp_b`, and 30% for `resgrp_c`. This means that the combined CPU usage of all processes assigned to `resgrp_a` is maintained at approximately 50%. Similarly, for all processes in `resgrp_b`, the combined CPU usage is kept to approximately 40%, and so on.

```sql
edb=# ALTER RESOURCE GROUP resgrp_a SET cpu_rate_limit TO .5;
ALTER RESOURCE GROUP
edb=# ALTER RESOURCE GROUP resgrp_b SET cpu_rate_limit TO .4;
ALTER RESOURCE GROUP
edb=# ALTER RESOURCE GROUP resgrp_c SET cpu_rate_limit TO .3;
ALTER RESOURCE GROUP
```

This query shows the settings of `cpu_rate_limit` in the catalog:

```sql
edb=# SELECT rgrpname, rgrpcpuratelimit FROM edb_resource_group;
__OUTPUT__
 rgrpname | rgrpcpuratelimit
----------+------------------
 resgrp_a |              0.5
 resgrp_b |              0.4
 resgrp_c |              0.3
(3 rows)
```

Changing the `cpu_rate_limit` of a resource group affects new processes that are assigned to the group. It also immediately affects any currently running processes that are members of the group. That is, if the `cpu_rate_limit` is changed from .5 to .3, currently running processes in the group are throttled downward so that the aggregate group CPU usage is near 30% instead of 50%.

To show the effect of setting the CPU rate limit for resource groups, the following `psql` command-line examples use a CPU-intensive calculation of 20000 factorial (multiplication of 20000 \* 19999 \* 19998, and so on) performed by the query `SELECT 20000!`. 

The resource groups with the CPU rate limit settings shown in the previous query are used in these examples.

## Example: Single process in a single group

This example shows that the current process is set to use resource group `resgrp_b`. The factorial calculation then starts.

```sql
edb=# SET edb_resource_group TO resgrp_b;
SET
edb=# SHOW edb_resource_group;
__OUTPUT__
 edb_resource_group
--------------------
 resgrp_b
(1 row)
edb=# SELECT 20000!;
```

In a second session, the Linux `top` command is used to display the CPU usage under the `%CPU` column. Because the `top` command output periodically changes, it represents a snapshot at an arbitrary point in time:

```shell
$ top
top - 16:37:03 up  4:15,  7 users,  load average: 0.49, 0.20, 0.38
Tasks: 202 total,   1 running, 201 sleeping,   0 stopped,   0 zombie
Cpu(s): 42.7%us,  2.3%sy,  0.0%ni, 55.0%id,  0.0%wa,  0.0%hi,  0.0%si,  0.0
Mem:   1025624k total,   791160k used,   234464k free,    23400k buffers
Swap:   103420k total,    13404k used,    90016k free,   373504k cached

  PID USER      PR  NI  VIRT  RES  SHR S %CPU %MEM    TIME+  COMMAND
28915 enterpri  20   0  195m 5900 4212 S 39.9  0.6   3:36.98 edb-postgres
 1033 root      20   0  171m  77m 2960 S  1.0  7.8   3:43.96 Xorg
 3040 user      20   0  278m  22m  14m S  1.0  2.2   3:41.72 knotify4
    .
    .
    .
```

The row where `edb-postgres` appears under the `COMMAND` column shows the `psql` session performing the factorial calculation. The CPU usage of the session shown under the `%CPU` column is 39.9, which is close to the 40% CPU limit set for resource group `resgrp_b`.

By contrast, if the `psql` session is removed from the resource group and the factorial calculation is performed again, the CPU usage is much higher.

```sql
edb=# SET edb_resource_group TO DEFAULT;
SET
edb=# SHOW edb_resource_group;
__OUTPUT__
 edb_resource_group
--------------------

(1 row)

edb=# SELECT 20000!;
```

Under the `%CPU` column for `edb-postgres`, the CPU usage is now 93.6, which is significantly higher than the 39.9 when the process was part of the resource group:

```shell
$ top
top - 16:43:03 up 4:21, 7 users, load average: 0.66, 0.33, 0.37
Tasks: 202 total, 5 running, 197 sleeping, 0 stopped, 0 zombie

Swap: 103420k total, 13404k used, 90016k free, 373508k cached

    .

    .
```

## Example: Multiple processes in a single group

As stated previously, the CPU rate limit applies to the aggregate of all processes in the resource group. This concept is shown in the following example.

The factorial calculation is performed simultaneously in two separate `psql` sessions, each of which was added to resource group `resgrp_b` that has `cpu_rate_limit` set to .4 (CPU usage of 40%).

### Session 1

```sql
edb=# SET edb_resource_group TO resgrp_b;
SET
edb=# SHOW edb_resource_group;
__OUTPUT__
 edb_resource_group
--------------------
 resgrp_b
(1 row)

edb=# SELECT 20000!;
```

### Session 2

```sql
edb=# SET edb_resource_group TO resgrp_b;
SET
edb=# SHOW edb_resource_group;
__OUTPUT__
 edb_resource_group
--------------------
 resgrp_b
(1 row)

edb=# SELECT 20000!;
```

A third session monitors the CPU usage:

```shell
$ top
top - 16:53:03 up 4:31, 7 users, load average: 0.31, 0.19, 0.27
Tasks: 202 total, 1 running, 201 sleeping, 0 stopped, 0 zombie
Cpu(s): 41.2%us, 3.0%sy, 0.0%ni, 55.8%id, 0.0%wa, 0.0%hi, 0.0%si, 0.0
Mem: 1025624k total, 792020k used, 233604k free, 23844k buffers
Swap: 103420k total, 13404k used, 90016k free, 373508k cached

  PID USER PR NI VIRT RES SHR S %CPU %MEM TIME+ COMMAND
29857 enterpri 20 0 195m 4708 3312 S 19.9 0.5 0:57.35 edb-postgres
28915 enterpri 20 0 195m 5900 4212 S 19.6 0.6 5:35.49 edb-postgres

    .
    .
    .
```

Two new processes named `edb-postgres` have `%CPU` values of 19.9 and 19.6. The sum is close to the 40% CPU usage set for resource group `resgrp_b`.

This command sequence displays the sum of all `edb-postgres` processes sampled over half-second time intervals. This example shows how the total CPU usage of the processes in the resource group changes over time as EDB Resource Manager throttles the processes to keep the total resource group CPU usage near 40%.

```shell
$ while [[ 1 -eq 1 ]]; do  top -d0.5 -b -n2 | grep edb-postgres | awk '{ SUM
+= $9} END { print SUM / 2 }'; done
37.2
39.1
38.9
38.3
44.7
39.2
42.5
39.1
39.2
39.2
41
42.85
46.1
    .
    .
    .
```

## Example: Multiple processes in multiple groups

In this example, two additional `psql` sessions are used along with the previous two sessions. The third and fourth sessions perform the same factorial calculation in resource group `resgrp_c` with a `cpu_rate_limit` of `.3` (30% CPU usage).

### Session 3

```sql
edb=# SET edb_resource_group TO resgrp_c;
SET
edb=# SHOW edb_resource_group;
__OUTPUT__
 edb_resource_group
--------------------
 resgrp_c
(1 row)

edb=# SELECT 20000!;
```

### Session 4

```sql
edb=# SET edb_resource_group TO resgrp_c;
SET
edb=# SHOW edb_resource_group;
__OUTPUT__
 edb_resource_group
--------------------
 resgrp_c
(1 row)
edb=# SELECT 20000!;
```

The `top` command displays the following output:

```shell
$ top
top - 17:45:09 up 5:23, 8 users, load average: 0.47, 0.17, 0.26
Tasks: 203 total, 4 running, 199 sleeping, 0 stopped, 0 zombie

```

The two resource groups in use have CPU usage limits of 40% and 30%. The sum of the `%CPU` column for the first two `edb-postgres` processes is 39.5 (approximately 40%, which is the limit for `resgrp_b`). The sum of the `%CPU` column for the third and fourth `edb-postgres` processes is 31.6 (approximately 30%, which is the limit for `resgrp_c`).

The sum of the CPU usage limits of the two resource groups to which these processes belong is 70%. The following output shows that the sum of the four processes borders around 70%:

```shell
$ while [[ 1 -eq 1 ]]; do  top -d0.5 -b -n2 | grep edb-postgres | awk '{ SUM
+= $9} END { print SUM / 2 }'; done

```

By contrast, if three sessions are processing. where two sessions remain in `resgrp_b` but the third session doesn't belong to any resource group, the `top` command shows the following output:

```shell
$ top
top - 17:24:55 up 5:03, 7 users, load average: 1.00, 0.41, 0.38

```

The second and third `edb-postgres` processes belonging to the resource group where the CPU usage is limited to 40% have a total CPU usage of 37.8. However, the first `edb-postgres` process has a 58.6% CPU usage, as it isn't within a resource group. It basically uses the remaining available CPU resources on the system.

Likewise, the following output shows the sum of all three sessions is around 95%, since one of the sessions has no set limit on its CPU usage:

```shell
$ while [[ 1 -eq 1 ]]; do  top -d0.5 -b -n2 | grep edb-postgres | awk '{ SUM
