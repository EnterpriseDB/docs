The syntax for deleting an entire package or the package body is:

```sql
DROP PACKAGE [ BODY ] package_name;
```

If you omit the keyword `BODY`, both the package specification and the package body are deleted, that is, the entire package is dropped. If you specify the keyword `BODY`, then only the package body is dropped. The package specification remains intact. `package_name` is the identifier of the package to drop.

The following statement destroys only the package body of `emp_admin`:

```sql
DROP PACKAGE BODY emp_admin;
```

The following statement drops the entire `emp_admin` package:

```sql
DROP PACKAGE emp_admin;
```
