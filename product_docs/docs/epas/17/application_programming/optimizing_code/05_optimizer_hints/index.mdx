When you invoke a `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, or `UPDATE` command, the server generates a set of execution plans. After analyzing those execution plans, the server selects a plan that generally returns the result set in the least amount of time. The server's choice of plan depends on several factors:

-   The estimated execution cost of data handling operations
-   Parameter values assigned to parameters in the `Query Tuning` section of the `postgresql.conf` file
-   Column statistics that were gathered by the ANALYZE command

As a rule, the query planner selects the least expensive plan. You can use an *optimizer hint* to influence the server as it selects a query plan.
