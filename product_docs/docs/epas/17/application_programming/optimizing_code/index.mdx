EDB Postgres Advanced Server includes features designed to help application programmers address database performance problems. SQL Profiler helps you locate and optimize poorly running SQL code. You can use optimizer hints to influence the server as it selects a query plan when you invoke a DELETE, INSERT, SELECT, or UPDATE command.
