A *nested table* is a type of collection that associates a positive integer with a value. 

## Nested tables overview

A nested table has the following characteristics:

-   You must define a *nested table type*. After that, you can declare *nested table variables* of that nested table type. Data manipulation occurs using the nested table variable, also known simply as a table.
-   When you declare a nested table variable, the nested table doesn't yet exist. It is a null collection. You must initialize the null table with a *constructor*. You can also initialize the table by using an assignment statement where the right-hand side of the assignment is an initialized table of the same type. 
!!! Note
    Initialization of a nested table is mandatory in Oracle but optional in SPL.
-   The key is a positive integer.
-   The constructor establishes the number of elements in the table. The `EXTEND` method adds elements to the table. For details, see [Collection methods](/epas/latest/reference/application_programmer_reference/stored_procedural_language_reference/11_collection_methods/#collection_methods). 
!!! Note
    Using the constructor to establish the number of elements in the table and using the `EXTEND` method to add elements to the table are mandatory in Oracle but optional in SPL.
-   The table can be sparse. There can be gaps in assigning values to keys.
-   An attempt to reference a table element beyond its initialized or extended size results in a `SUBSCRIPT_BEYOND_COUNT` exception.

## Defining a nested table

Use the `TYPE IS TABLE` statement to define a nested table type in the declaration section of an SPL program:

```sql
TYPE <tbltype> IS TABLE OF { <datatype> | <rectype> | <objtype> };
```

Where: 

`tbltype` is an identifier assigned to the nested table type. 

`datatype` is a scalar data type such as `VARCHAR2` or `NUMBER`. 

`rectype` is a previously defined record type. 

`objtype` is a previously defined object type.

!!! Note
    You can use the `CREATE TYPE` command to define a nested table type that's available to all SPL programs in the database. See [SQL reference](../../../reference/oracle_compatibility_reference/epas_compat_sql/39_create_type/) for more information about the `CREATE TYPE` command.

## Declaring a variable

To use the table, you must declare a *variable* of that nested table type. The following is the syntax for declaring a table variable:

```text
<table> <tbltype>
```

Where: 

`table` is an identifier assigned to the nested table. 

`tbltype` is the identifier of a previously defined nested table type.

## Initializing the nested table

Initialize a nested table using the nested table type’s constructor:

```sql
<tbltype> ([ { <expr1> | NULL } [, { <expr2> | NULL } ] [, ...] ])
```

Where:

`tbltype` is the identifier of the nested table type’s constructor, which has the same name as the nested table type. 

`expr1, expr2, …` are expressions that are type-compatible with the element type of the table. If you specify `NULL`, the corresponding element is set to null. If the parameter list is empty, then an empty nested table is returned, which means the table has no elements. If the table is defined from an object type, then `exprn` must return an object of that object type. The object can be the return value of a function or the object type’s constructor. Or the object can be an element of another nested table of the same type.

If you apply a collection method other than `EXISTS` to an uninitialized nested table, a `COLLECTION_IS_NULL` exception is thrown. For details, see [Collection methods](/epas/latest/reference/application_programmer_reference/stored_procedural_language_reference/11_collection_methods/#collection_methods).

This example shows a constructor for a nested table:

```sql
DECLARE
    TYPE nested_typ IS TABLE OF CHAR(1);
    v_nested        nested_typ := nested_typ('A','B');
```

## Referencing an element of the table

Reference an element of the table using the following syntax:

```text
<table>(<n>)[<.element> ]
```

Where: 

`table` is the identifier of a previously declared table. 

`n` is a positive integer. 

If the table type of `table` is defined from a record type or object type, then `[.element  ]` must reference an individual field in the record type or attribute in the object type from which the nested table type is defined. Alternatively, you can reference the entire record or object by omitting `[.element  ]`.

## Examples

This example shows a nested table where it's known that there are four elements:

```sql
DECLARE
    TYPE dname_tbl_typ IS TABLE OF VARCHAR2(14);
    dname_tbl       dname_tbl_typ;
    CURSOR dept_cur IS SELECT dname FROM dept ORDER BY dname;
    i               INTEGER := 0;
BEGIN
    dname_tbl := dname_tbl_typ(NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
    FOR r_dept IN dept_cur LOOP
        i := i + 1;
        dname_tbl(i) := r_dept.dname;
    END LOOP;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('DNAME');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('----------');
    FOR j IN 1..i LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(dname_tbl(j));
    END LOOP;
END;
```

The following is the output from the example:

```sql
__OUTPUT__
DNAME
----------
ACCOUNTING
OPERATIONS
RESEARCH
SALES
```

This example reads the first 10 employee names from the `emp` table, stores them in a nested table, and then displays the results from the table. The SPL code is written to assume that the number of employees to return isn't known beforehand.

```sql
DECLARE
    TYPE emp_rec_typ IS RECORD (
        empno       NUMBER(4),
        ename       VARCHAR2(10)
    );
    TYPE emp_tbl_typ IS TABLE OF emp_rec_typ;
    emp_tbl         emp_tbl_typ;
    CURSOR emp_cur IS SELECT empno, ename FROM emp WHERE ROWNUM <= 10;
    i               INTEGER := 0;
BEGIN
    emp_tbl := emp_tbl_typ();
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('EMPNO    ENAME');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('-----    -------');
    FOR r_emp IN emp_cur LOOP
        i := i + 1;
        emp_tbl.EXTEND;
        emp_tbl(i) := r_emp;
    END LOOP;
    FOR j IN 1..10 LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(emp_tbl(j).empno || '     ' ||
            emp_tbl(j).ename);
    END LOOP;
END;
```

An empty table with the constructor `emp_tbl_typ()` is created as the first statement in the executable section of the anonymous block. The `EXTEND` collection method is then used to add an element to the table for each employee returned from the result set. See [Extend](/epas/latest/reference/application_programmer_reference/stored_procedural_language_reference/11_collection_methods/04_extend/#extend).

The following is the output:

```sql
__OUTPUT__
EMPNO    ENAME
-----    -------
7369     SMITH
7499     ALLEN
7521     WARD
7566     JONES
7654     MARTIN
7698     BLAKE
7782     CLARK
7788     SCOTT
7839     KING
7844     TURNER
```

This example shows how you can use a nested table of an object type. First, create an object type with attributes for the department name and location:

```sql
CREATE TYPE dept_obj_typ AS OBJECT (
    dname           VARCHAR2(14),
    loc             VARCHAR2(13)
);
```

This anonymous block defines a nested table type whose element consists of the `dept_obj_typ` object type. A nested table variable is declared, initialized, and then populated from the `dept` table. Finally, the elements from the nested table are displayed.

```sql
DECLARE
    TYPE dept_tbl_typ IS TABLE OF dept_obj_typ;
    dept_tbl        dept_tbl_typ;
    CURSOR dept_cur IS SELECT dname, loc FROM dept ORDER BY dname;
    i               INTEGER := 0;
BEGIN
    dept_tbl := dept_tbl_typ(
        dept_obj_typ(NULL,NULL),
        dept_obj_typ(NULL,NULL),
        dept_obj_typ(NULL,NULL),
        dept_obj_typ(NULL,NULL)
    );
    FOR r_dept IN dept_cur LOOP
        i := i + 1;
        dept_tbl(i).dname := r_dept.dname;
        dept_tbl(i).loc   := r_dept.loc;
    END LOOP;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('DNAME          LOC');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('----------     ----------');
    FOR j IN 1..i LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(RPAD(dept_tbl(j).dname,14) || ' ' ||
            dept_tbl(j).loc);
    END LOOP;
END;
```

The parameters that make up the nested table’s constructor, `dept_tbl_typ`, are calls to the object type’s constructor `dept_obj_typ.` The following is the output from the anonymous block:

```sql
__OUTPUT__
DNAME          LOC
----------     ----------
ACCOUNTING     NEW YORK
OPERATIONS     BOSTON
RESEARCH       DALLAS
SALES          CHICAGO
```
