EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports *row-level* and *statement-level* triggers. 

- A row-level trigger fires once for each row that's affected by a triggering event. For example, suppose deletion is defined as a triggering event on a table, and a single `DELETE` command is issued that deletes five rows from the table. In this case, the trigger fires five times, once for each row.

- A statement-level trigger fires once per triggering statement, regardless of the number of rows affected by the triggering event. In the previous example of a single `DELETE` command deleting five rows, a statement-level trigger fires only once.

You can define the sequence of actions regarding whether the trigger code block executes before or after the triggering statement for statement-level triggers. For row-level triggers, you can define whether the trigger code block executes before or after each row is affected by the triggering statement.

- In a *before* row-level trigger, the trigger code block executes before the triggering action is carried out on each affected row. In a *before* statement-level trigger, the trigger code block executes before the action of the triggering statement is carried out.

- In an *after* row-level trigger, the trigger code block executes after the triggering action is carried out on each affected row. In an *after* statement-level trigger, the trigger code block executes after the action of the triggering statement is carried out.

In a *compound trigger*, you can define a statement-level and a row-level trigger in a single trigger and fire it at more than one timing point. For details, see [Compound triggers](06_compound_triggers/#compound_triggers).
