<div id="basic_object_concepts" class="registered_link"></div>

An object type is a description or definition of some entity. This definition of an object type is characterized by two components:

-   Attributes &mdash; Fields that describe particular characteristics of an object instance. For a person object, examples are name, address, gender, date of birth, height, weight, eye color, and occupation.
-   Methods &mdash; Programs that perform some type of function or operation on or are related to an object. For a person object, examples are calculating the person’s age, displaying the person’s attributes, and changing the values assigned to the person’s attributes.
