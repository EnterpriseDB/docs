Once you declare a cursor variable, you must open it with an associated `SELECT` command. The `OPEN FOR` statement specifies the `SELECT` command to use to create the result set:

```sql
OPEN <name> FOR query;
```

Where:

`name` is the identifier of a previously declared cursor variable. 

`query` is a `SELECT` command that determines the result set when the statement is executed. 

The value of the cursor variable after the `OPEN FOR` statement is executed identifies the result set.

This example shows a result set that's a list of employee numbers and names from a selected department. You can use a variable or parameter in the `SELECT` command anywhere an expression can normally appear. In this case, a parameter is used in the equality test for department number.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE emp_by_dept (
    p_deptno        emp.deptno%TYPE
)
IS
    emp_refcur      SYS_REFCURSOR;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_refcur FOR SELECT empno, ename FROM emp WHERE deptno = p_deptno;
        ...
```
