<div id="database_object_privileges" class="registered_link"></div>

Once an SPL program begins execution, any attempt to access a database object from the program results in a check. This check ensures that the current user is authorized to perform the intended action against the referenced object. Privileges on database objects are added and removed using the `GRANT` and `REVOKE` commands. If the current user attempts unauthorized access on a database object, then the program throws an exception. See [Exception handling](/epas/latest/reference/application_programmer_reference/stored_procedural_language_reference/05_control_structures/07_exception_handling/#exception_handling).
