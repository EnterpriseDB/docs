In addition to allowing comments on objects supported by the PostgreSQL `COMMENT` command, EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports comments on other object types. The complete supported syntax is:

```sql
COMMENT ON
{
  AGGREGATE <aggregate_name> ( <aggregate_signature> ) |
  CAST (<source_type> AS <target_type>) |
  COLLATION <object_name> |
  COLUMN <relation_name>.<column_name> |
  CONSTRAINT <constraint_name> ON <table_name> |
  CONSTRAINT <constraint_name> ON DOMAIN <domain_name> |
  CONVERSION <object_name> |
  DATABASE <object_name> |
  DOMAIN <object_name> |
  EXTENSION <object_name> |
  EVENT TRIGGER <object_name> |
  FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER <object_name> |
  FOREIGN TABLE <object_name> |
  FUNCTION <func_name> ([[<argmode>] [<argname>] <argtype> [,...]])|
  INDEX <object_name> |
  LARGE OBJECT <large_object_oid> |
  MATERIALIZED VIEW <object_name> |
  OPERATOR <operator_name> (left_type, right_type) |
  OPERATOR CLASS <object_name> USING <index_method> |
  OPERATOR FAMILY <object_name> USING <index_method> |
  PACKAGE <object_name>
  POLICY <policy_name> ON <table_name> |
  [ PROCEDURAL ] LANGUAGE <object_name> |
  PROCEDURE <proc_name> [([[<argmode>] [<argname>] <argtype> [, ...]])]
  PUBLIC SYNONYM <object_name>
  ROLE <object_name> |
  RULE <rule_name> ON <table_name> |
  SCHEMA <object_name> |
  SEQUENCE <object_name> |
  SERVER <object_name> |
  TABLE <object_name> |
  TABLESPACE <object_name> |
  TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION <object_name> |
  TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY <object_name> |
  TEXT SEARCH PARSER <object_name> |
  TEXT SEARCH TEMPLATE <object_name> |
  TRANSFORM FOR <type_name> LANGUAGE <lang_name> |
  TRIGGER <trigger_name> ON <table_name> |
  TYPE <object_name> |
  VIEW <object_name>
} IS <'text'>
```

Where `aggregate_signature` is:

```sql
* |
[ <argmode> ] [ <argname> ] <argtype> [ , ... ] |
[ [ <argmode> ] [ <argname> ] <argtype> [ , ... ] ]
ORDER BY [ <argmode> ] [ <argname> ] <argtype> [ , ... ]
```

## Parameters

`object_name`

The name of the object on which you're commenting.

`AGGREGATE aggregate_name (aggregate_signature)`

Include the `AGGREGATE` clause to create a comment about an aggregate. `aggregate_name` specifies the name of an aggregate. `aggregate_signature` specifies the associated signature in one of the following forms:

```sql
* |
[ <argmode> ] [ <argname> ] <argtype> [ , ... ] |
[ [ <argmode> ] [ <argname> ] <argtype> [ , ... ] ]
ORDER BY [ <argmode> ] [ <argname> ] <argtype> [ , ... ]
```

Where `argmode` is the mode of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument. `argmode` can be `IN`, `OUT`, `INOUT`, or `VARIADIC`. The default is `IN`.

`argname` is the name of an aggregate argument.

`argtype` is the data type of an aggregate argument.

`CAST (source_type AS target_type)`

Include the `CAST` clause to create a comment about a cast. When creating a comment about a cast, `source_type` specifies the source data type of the cast, and `target_type` specifies the target data type of the cast.

`COLUMN relation_name.column_name`

Include the `COLUMN` clause to create a comment about a column. `column_name` specifies the name of the column to which the comment applies. `relation_name` is the table, view, composite type, or foreign table in which a column resides.

`CONSTRAINT constraint_name ON table_name`

`CONSTRAINT constraint_name ON DOMAIN domain_name`

Include the `CONSTRAINT` clause to add a comment about a constraint. When you're creating a comment about a constraint, `constraint_name` specifies the name of the constraint. `table_name` or `domain_name` specifies the name of the table or domain on which the constraint is defined.

`FUNCTION func_name ([[argmode] [argname] argtype [, ...]])`

Include the `FUNCTION` clause to add a comment about a function. `func_name` specifies the name of the function. `argmode` specifies the mode of the function. `argmode` can be `IN`, `OUT`, `INOUT`, or `VARIADIC`. The default is `IN`.

`argname` specifies the name of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument. `argtype` specifies the data type of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument.

`large_object_oid`

`large_object_oid` is the system-assigned OID of the large object about which you're commenting.

`OPERATOR operator_name (left_type, right_type)`

Include the `OPERATOR` clause to add a comment about an operator. `operator_name` specifies the optionally schema-qualified name of an operator on which you're commenting. `left_type` and `right_type` are the optionally schema-qualified data types of the operator's arguments.

`OPERATOR CLASS object_name USING index_method`

Include the `OPERATOR CLASS` clause to add a comment about an operator class. `object_name` specifies the optionally schema-qualified name of an operator on which you're commenting. `index_method` specifies the associated index method of the operator class.

`OPERATOR FAMILY object_name USING index_method`

Include the `OPERATOR FAMILY` clause to add a comment about an operator family. `object_name` specifies the optionally schema-qualified name of an operator family on which you're commenting. `index_method` specifies the associated index method of the operator family.

`POLICY policy_name ON table_name`

Include the `POLICY` clause to add a comment about a policy. `policy_name` specifies the name of the policy. `table_name` specifies the table that the policy is associated with.

`PROCEDURE proc_name [([[argmode] [argname] argtype [, ...]])]`

Include the `PROCEDURE` clause to add a comment about a procedure. `proc_name` specifies the name of the procedure. `argmode` specifies the mode of the procedure. `argmode` can be `IN`, `OUT`, `INOUT`, or `VARIADIC`. The default is `IN`.

`argname` specifies the name of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument. `argtype` specifies the data type of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument.

`RULE rule_name ON table_name`

Include the `RULE` clause to specify a comment on a rule. `rule_name` specifies the name of the rule. `table_name` specifies the name of the table on which the rule is defined.

`TRANSFORM FOR type_name LANGUAGE lang_name`

Include the `TRANSFORM FOR` clause to specify a comment on a `TRANSFORM`.

`type_name` specifies the name of the data type of the transform. `lang_name` specifies the name of the language of the transform.

`TRIGGER trigger_name ON table_name`

Include the `TRIGGER` clause to specify a comment on a trigger. `trigger_name` specifies the name of the trigger. `table_name` specifies the name of the table on which the trigger is defined.

`text`

The comment, written as a string literal, or `NULL` to drop the comment.

!!! Note
    Names of tables, aggregates, collations, conversions, domains, foreign tables, functions, indexes, operators, operator classes, operator families, packages, procedures, sequences, text search objects, types, and views can be schema qualified.

## Example

This example adds a comment to a table named `new_emp`:

```sql
COMMENT ON TABLE new_emp IS 'This table contains information about new
employees.';
```

For more information about using the `COMMENT` command, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-comment.html).
