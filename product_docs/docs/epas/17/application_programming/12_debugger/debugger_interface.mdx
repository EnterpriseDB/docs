The main debugger window contains two panels:

-   The top Program Body panel displays the program source code.
-   The bottom Tabs panel provides a set of tabs for different information.

Use the tool bar icons located at the top panel to access debugging functions.

## The Program Body panel

The Program Body panel displays the source code of the program that's being debugged. The figure shows that the debugger is about to execute the `SELECT` statement. The blue indicator in the program body highlights the next statement to execute.

## The Tabs panel

You can use the bottom Tabs panel to view or modify parameter values or local variables or to view messages generated by `RAISE INFO` and function results.

The following is the information displayed by the tabs in the panel:

-   The **Parameters** tab displays the current parameter values.
-   The **Local variables** tab displays the value of any variables declared in the program.
-   The **Messages** tab displays any results returned by the program as it executes.
-   The **Results** tab displays any program results, such as the value from the `RETURN` statement of a function.
-   The **Stack** tab displays the call stack.

## The Stack tab

<div id="stack_tab" class="registered_link"></div>

The **Stack** tab displays a list of programs that are currently on the call stack, that is, programs that were invoked but that haven't yet completed. When a program is called, the name of the program is added to the top of the list displayed in the **Stack** tab. When the program ends, its name is removed from the list.

The **Stack** tab also displays information about program calls. The information includes:

-   The location of the call in the program
-   The call arguments
-   The name of the program being called

Reviewing the call stack can help you trace the course of execution through a series of nested programs. 
The figure shows that `emp_query_caller` is about to call a subprogram named `emp_query`. `emp_query_caller` is currently at the top of the call stack.

After the call to `emp_query` executes, `emp_query` is displayed at the top of the **Stack** tab, and its code is displayed in the Program Body panel.

After completing execution of the subprogram, control returns to the calling program (`emp_query_caller`), now displayed at the top of the **Stack** tab.
