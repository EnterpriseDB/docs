EDB Postgres Advanced Server's query planner uses *partition pruning* to compute an efficient plan to locate any rows that match the conditions specified in the `WHERE` clause of a `SELECT` statement. To successfully prune partitions from an execution plan, the `WHERE` clause must constrain the information that's compared to the partitioning key column specified when creating the partitioned table. 

| When querying a...         | Partition pruning is effective when... |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| List-partitioned table     | The `WHERE` clause compares a literal value to the partitioning key using operators like equal (=) or `AND`. |
| Range-partitioned table    | The `WHERE` clause compares a literal value to a partitioning key using operators such as equal (=), less than (&lt;), or greater than (>).
| Hash-partitioned table     | The `WHERE` clause compares a literal value to the partitioning key using an operator such as equal (=). |

## Partition pruning techniques

The partition pruning mechanism uses two optimization techniques:

-   Constraint exclusion
-   Fast pruning

Partition pruning techniques limit the search for data only to those partitions where the values you're searching for might reside. Both pruning techniques remove partitions from a query's execution plan, improving performance.

The difference between the fast pruning and constraint exclusion is that fast pruning understands the relationship between the partitions in an Oracle-partitioned table. Constraint exclusion doesn't. For example, when a query searches for a specific value in a list-partitioned table, fast pruning can reason that only a specific partition can hold that value. Constraint exclusion must examine the constraints defined for each partition. Fast pruning occurs early in the planning process to reduce the number of partitions that the planner must consider. Constraint exclusion occurs late in the planning process.

[This example](01_example_partition_pruning.mdx) shows the efficiency of partition pruning, using the `EXPLAIN` statement to confirm that EDB Postgres Advanced Server is pruning partitions from the execution plan of a query.

## Using constraint exclusion

The `constraint_exclusion` parameter controls constraint exclusion. The `constraint_exclusion` parameter can have a value of `on`, `off`, or `partition`. To enable constraint exclusion, you must set the parameter to either `partition` or `on`. By default, the parameter is set to `partition`.

For more information about constraint exclusion, see the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-partitioning.html).

When constraint exclusion is enabled, the server examines the constraints defined for each partition to determine if that partition can satisfy a query.

When you execute a `SELECT` statement that doesn't contain a `WHERE` clause, the query planner must recommend an execution plan that searches the entire table. When you execute a `SELECT` statement that contains a `WHERE` clause, the query planner:

-  Determines the partition to store the row
-  Sends query fragments to that partition
-  Prunes the partitions that can't contain that row from the execution plan

If you aren't using partitioned tables, disabling constraint exclusion might improve performance.

## Using fast pruning

Like constraint exclusion, fast pruning can optimize only queries that include a `WHERE` or join clause. However, the qualifiers in the `WHERE` clause must match a certain form. In both cases, the query planner avoids searching for data in partitions that can't hold the data required by the query.

Fast pruning is controlled by a Boolean configuration parameter named `edb_enable_pruning`. Set `edb_enable_pruning` to `ON` to enable fast pruning of certain queries. Set `edb_enable_pruning` to `OFF` to disable fast pruning.

!!! Note
    Fast pruning can optimize queries against subpartitioned tables or optimize queries against range-partitioned tables only for tables that are partitioned on one column.

For LIST-partitioned tables, EDB Postgres Advanced Server can fast prune queries that contain a `WHERE` clause that constrains a partitioning column to a literal value. For example, given a LIST-partitioned table such as:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sales_hist(..., country text, ...)
PARTITION BY LIST(country)
(
    PARTITION americas VALUES('US', 'CA', 'MX'),
    PARTITION europe VALUES('BE', 'NL', 'FR'),
    PARTITION asia VALUES('JP', 'PK', 'CN'),
    PARTITION others VALUES(DEFAULT)
)
```

Fast pruning can reason about `WHERE` clauses such as:

 `WHERE country = 'US'`

 `WHERE country IS NULL;`

With the first `WHERE` clause, fast pruning eliminates partitions `europe`, `asia`, and `others` because those partitions can't hold rows that satisfy the qualifier `WHERE country = 'US'`.

With the second `WHERE` clause, fast pruning eliminates partitions `americas`, `europe`, and `asia` because those partitions can't hold rows where `country IS NULL`.

The operator specified in the `WHERE` clause must be an equals sign (=) or the equality operator appropriate for the data type of the partitioning column.

For range-partitioned tables, EDB Postgres Advanced Server can fast prune queries that contain a `WHERE` clause that constrains a partitioning column to a literal value. However, the operator can be any of the following:

 `>`

 `>=`

 `=`

 `<=`

 `<`

Fast pruning also reasons about more complex expressions involving `AND` and `BETWEEN` operators, such as:

```sql
WHERE size > 100 AND size <= 200
WHERE size BETWEEN 100 AND 200
```

Fast pruning can't prune based on expressions involving `OR` or `IN`. For example, when querying a RANGE-partitioned table, such as:

```sql
CREATE TABLE boxes(id int, size int, color text)
  PARTITION BY RANGE(size)
(
    PARTITION small VALUES LESS THAN(100),
    PARTITION medium VALUES LESS THAN(200),
    PARTITION large VALUES LESS THAN(300)
)
```

Fast pruning can reason about `WHERE` clauses such as:

 `WHERE size > 100     -- scan partitions 'medium' and 'large'`

 `WHERE size >= 100    -- scan partitions 'medium' and 'large'`

 `WHERE size = 100     -- scan partition 'medium'`

 `WHERE size <= 100    -- scan partitions 'small' and 'medium'`

 `WHERE size < 100     -- scan partition 'small'`

 `WHERE size > 100 AND size < 199     -- scan partition 'medium'`

 `WHERE size BETWEEN 100 AND 199      -- scan partition 'medium'`

 `WHERE color = 'red' AND size = 100  -- scan 'medium'`

 `WHERE color = 'red' AND (size > 100 AND size < 199) -- scan 'medium'`

In each case, fast pruning requires that the qualifier refer to a partitioning column and literal value (or `IS NULL/IS NOT NULL`).

!!! Note
    Fast pruning can also optimize `DELETE` and `UPDATE` statements containing these `WHERE` clauses.
