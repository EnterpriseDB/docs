A service is a program that runs in the background and requires no user interaction. A service has no user interface. You can configure a service to start at boot time or manually on demand. Services are best controlled using the platform-specific operating system service control utility. Many of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server supporting components are services.

The following table lists the names of the services that control EDB Postgres Advanced Server and services that control EDB Postgres Advanced Server supporting components:
