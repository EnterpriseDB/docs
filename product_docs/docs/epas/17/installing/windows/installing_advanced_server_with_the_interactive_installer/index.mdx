You can use the EDB Postgres Advanced Server interactive installer to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on Windows. The interactive installer is available from [Downloads page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/advanced-downloads) on the EDB website.

You can invoke the graphical installer in different installation modes to perform an EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation.

During the installation, the graphical installer copies a number of temporary files to the location specified by the `TEMP` environment variable. You can optionally specify an alternative location for the temporary files by modifying the value of the `TEMP` environment variable at the command line:

```text
SET TEMP=<temp_file_location>
```

Where `<temp_file_location>` specifies the alternative location for the temporary files and must match the permissions with the `TEMP` environment variable.

!!! Note
    If you're invoking the installer to perform a system upgrade, the installer preserves the configuration options specified during the previous installation.
