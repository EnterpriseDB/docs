The StackBuilder Plus utility provides a graphical interface that simplifies the process of updating, downloading, and installing modules that complement your EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation. When you install a module with StackBuilder Plus, StackBuilder Plus resolves any software dependencies.

You can invoke StackBuilder Plus any time after the installation is complete by selecting **Apps > StackBuilder Plus**. If prompted, enter your system password, and the StackBuilder Plus welcome window opens.

From the list, select your EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation.

StackBuilder Plus requires Internet access. If your installation of EDB Postgres Advanced Server is behind a firewall with restricted Internet access, StackBuilder Plus can download program installers through a proxy server. The module provider determines if the module can be accessed through an HTTP proxy or an FTP proxy. Currently, all updates are transferred by way of an HTTP proxy. The FTP proxy information isn't used.

If the selected EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation has restricted Internet access, on the welcome window, select **Proxy Servers** to open the Proxy Servers dialog box.

In the Proxy Servers dialog box, in the **HTTP proxy** fieldm enter the IP address and port number of the proxy server. Currently, all StackBuilder Plus modules are distributed by way of HTTP proxy, and FTP proxy information is ignored. Select **OK**.

The tree control on the StackBuilder Plus module selection window displays a node for each module category.

To review a detailed description of the component, expand a module and select a component name in the tree control. To add components to the installation or to upgrade a component, select the check box to the left of a module name and select **Next**.

StackBuilder Plus confirms the packages selected.

Use the browse icon (...) to the right of the **Download directory** field to open a file selector and choose an alternativee location to store the downloaded installers. Select **Next** to connect to the server and download the required installation files.

When the download completes, a window opens that confirms the installation files were downloaded and are ready for installation.

To start the installation process, leave the **Skip Installation** box cleared and select **Next**. To exit StackBuilder Plus without installing the downloaded files, select the check box, and select **Next**.

Each downloaded installer has different requirements. As the installers execute, they might prompt you to confirm acceptance of license agreements, enter passwords, and provide configuration information.

During the installation process, you might be prompted by one or more of the installers to restart your system. Select **No** or **Restart Later** until all installations are completed. When the last installation has completed, restart the system to apply all of the updates.

You might occasionally encounter packages that donâ€™t install successfully. If a package fails to install, StackBuilder Plus alerts you to the installation error and writes a message to the log file at `%TEMP%`.

When the installation is complete, StackBuilder Plus alerts you to the success or failure of the installations of the requested packages. If you were prompted by an installer to restart your computer, restart now.
