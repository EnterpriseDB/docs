navTitle: "Setting cluster preferences"
---

During an installation, the graphical installer invokes the PostgreSQL `initdb` utility to initialize a cluster. If you are using the graphical installer, you can use the `INITDBOPTS` environment variable to specify your `initdb` preferences. Before invoking the graphical installer, set the value of `INITDBOPTS` at the command line, specifying one or more cluster options. For example:

```text
SET INITDBOPTS= -k -E=UTF-8
```

If you specify values in `INITDBOPTS` that are also provided by the installer (such as the `â€“D` option, which specifies the installation directory), the value specified in the graphical installer supersedes the value if specified in `INITDBOPTS`.

For more information about using `initdb` cluster configuration options, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-initdb.html). In addition to the cluster configuration options documented in the PostgreSQL core documentation, EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports the following `initdb` options:

`--no-redwood-compat`

`--no-redwood-compat` instructs the server to create the cluster in PostgreSQL mode. When the cluster is created in PostgreSQL mode, the name of the database superuser is `postgres` and the name of the default database is `postgres`. A small subset of Advanced Server features compatible with Oracle databases are available with this mode. However, we recommend using Advanced Server in redwood compatibility mode to have access to all its Oracle compatibility features.

`--redwood-like`

`--redwood-like` instructs the server to use an escape character (an empty string ('')) following the `LIKE` (or PostgreSQL compatible `ILIKE`) operator in a SQL statement that is compatible with Oracle syntax.

`--icu-short-form`

`--icu-short-form` creates a cluster that uses a default ICU (International Components for Unicode) collation for all databases in the cluster. For more information about Unicode collations, see [Basic Unicode collation algorithm concepts](../../../tools_utilities_and_components/application_developer_tools/06_unicode_collation_algorithm).
