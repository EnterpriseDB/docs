You can use the `INITDBOPTS` variable to specify your cluster configuration preferences. By default, the `INITDBOPTS` variable is commented out in the service configuration file. Unless you modify it, when you run the service startup script, the new cluster is created in a mode compatible with Oracle databases. Clusters created in this mode contain a database named `edb` and have a database superuser named enterprisedb.

## Initializing the cluster in Oracle mode

If you initialize the database using Oracle-compatibility mode, the installation includes:

-   Data dictionary views compatible with Oracle databases.
-   Oracle data type conversions.
-   Date values displayed in a format compatible with Oracle syntax.
-   Support for Oracle-styled concatenation rules. If you concatenate a string value with a `NULL` value, the returned value is the value of the string.
-   Support for the following Oracle built-in packages.

## Initializing the cluster in Postgres mode

Clusters created in PostgreSQL mode don't include compatibility features. To create a new cluster in PostgreSQL mode, remove the pound sign (#) in front of the `INITDBOPTS` variable, which enables the `--no-redwood-compat` option. Clusters created in PostgreSQL mode contain a database named `postgres` and have a database superuser named postgres.

You can also specify multiple `initdb` options. For example, the following statement creates a database cluster without compatibility features for Oracle. The cluster contains a database named `postgres` that's owned by a user named alice. The cluster uses UTF-8 encoding.

```text
INITDBOPTS="--no-redwood-compat -U alice --locale=en_US.UTF-8"
```

If you initialize the database using `--no-redwood-compat` mode, the installation includes the following packages.

| Package            | Functionality noncompatible with Oracle databases                                                               |

| `edb_bulkload`     | Provides direct/conventional data loading capability when loading huge amount of data into a database.           |
| `edb_gen`          | Provides miscellaneous packages to run built-in packages.                                                        |
| `edb_objects`      | Provides Oracle-compatible objects such as packages and procedures.                                             |
| `waitstates`       | Provides monitor session blocking.                                                                               |
| `edb_dblink_libpq` | Provides link to foreign databases by way of libpq.                                                                    |
| `edb_dblink_oci`   | Provides link to foreign databases by way of OCI.                                                                      |
| `snap_tables`      | Creates tables to hold wait information. Included with DRITA scripts.                                            |
| `snap_functions`   | Creates functions to return a list of snap ids and the time the snapshot was taken. Included with DRITA scripts. |
| `sys_stats`        | Provides OS performance statistics.                                                                              |

In addition to the cluster configuration options documented in the PostgreSQL core documentation, EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports the following `initdb` options:

`--no-redwood-compat`

Include the `--no-redwood-compat` keywords to create the cluster in PostgreSQL mode. When the cluster is created in PostgreSQL mode, the name of the database superuser is postgres, and the name of the default database is `postgres`. The few EDB Postgres Advanced Server features compatible with Oracle databases are available with this mode. However, we recommend using the EDB Postgres Advanced Server in redwood compatibility mode to use all its features.

`--redwood-like`

Include the `--redwood-like` keywords to use an escape character. The character is an empty string ('') and it follows the `LIKE` (or PostgreSQL-compatible `ILIKE`) operator in a SQL statement that's compatible with Oracle syntax.

`--icu-short-form`

Include the `--icu-short-form` keywords to create a cluster that uses a default International Components for Unicode (ICU) collation for all databases in the cluster. For more information about Unicode collations, see [Unicode collation algorithm](/epas/latest/tools_utilities_and_components/application_developer_tools/06_unicode_collation_algorithm/).

For more information about using `initdb` and the available cluster configuration options, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-initdb.html).

You can also view online help for `initdb` by assuming superuser privileges and entering:

```text
/path_to_initdb_installation_directory/initdb --help
```

Where `path_to_initdb_installation_directory` specifies the location of the `initdb` binary file.
