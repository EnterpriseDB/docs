If you have an existing EDB Postgres Advanced Server RPM installation, you can use yum or dnf to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. 

To update the `edb.repo` file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

```text
dnf upgrade edb-repo
```

`dnf` updates the `edb.repo` file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your `edb.repo` file. Then, you can use `dnf` to upgrade all packages whose names include the expression `edb`:

```text
dnf upgrade edb*
```

!!! Note
    The `dnf upgrade` command performs an update only between minor releases. To update between major releases, use `pg_upgrade`.

For more information about using dnf commands and options, see the [dnf documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/dnf/).
