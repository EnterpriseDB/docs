If you have an existing EDB Postgres Advanced Server RPM installation, you can use yum or dnf to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. 

To update the `edb.repo` file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum upgrade edb-repo
    ```

-   On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8:

    ```text
    dnf upgrade edb-repo
    ```

yum or dnf updates the `edb.repo` file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your `edb.repo` file. Then, you can use yum or dnf to upgrade all packages whose names include the expression `edb`:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum upgrade edb*
    ```

-   On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8:

    ```text
    dnf upgrade edb*
    ```

!!! Note
    The `yum upgrade` or `dnf upgrade` commands perform an update only between minor releases. To update between major releases, use `pg_upgrade`.

For more information about using yum commands and options, enter `yum --help` at the command line.

For more information about using dnf commands and options, see the [dnf documentation](https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/dnf/).
