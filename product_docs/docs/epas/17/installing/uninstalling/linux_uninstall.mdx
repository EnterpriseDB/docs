!!! Note
    After uninstalling EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the cluster data files remain intact, and the service user persists. You can manually remove the cluster `data` and service user from the system.

## Uninstalling on RHEL/AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux

You can use  `dnf` command to remove installed packages. Removing a package doesn't damage the EDB Postgres Advanced Server `data` directory.

Include the `-e` option when invoking the `rpm` command to remove an installed package:

```text
rpm -e <package_name>
```

Where `package_name` is the name of the package that you want to remove.

You can use the `dnf remove` command to remove a package installed by dnf. To remove a package, at the command line, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

    ```text
    dnf remove <package_name>
    ```

Where `package_name` is the name of the package that you want to remove.

yum and rpm don't remove a package that's required by another package. If you attempt to remove a package that satisfies a package dependency, yum or rpm provides a warning.

!!! Note
    In RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8 or 9, removing a package also removes all its dependencies that aren't required by other packages. To override this default behavior of RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8 or 9, disable the `clean_requirements_on_remove` parameter in the `/etc/yum.conf` file.

To uninstall EDB Postgres Advanced Server and its dependent packages, enter:

```text
dnf remove edb-as<xx>-server*
```

Where `<xx>` is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version number.


## Uninstalling on Debian or Ubuntu

-   To uninstall EDB Postgres Advanced Server, invoke the following command. The configuration files and data directory remains intact.

    ```text
    apt-get remove edb-as<xx>-server*
    ```

-   To uninstall EDB Postgres Advanced Server, configuration files, and data directory, invoke the following command:

    ```text

    ```
