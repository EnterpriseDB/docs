EDB Postgres Advanced Server is a *relational database management system* (RDBMS), which means it's a system for managing data stored in *relations*. A relation is essentially a mathematical term for a *table*. Each table is a named collection of *rows*. Each row of a given table has the same set of named *columns*, and each column is of a specific *data type*. Whereas columns have a fixed order in each row, it's important to remember that SQL doesn't guarantee the order of the rows in the table in any way (although you can explicitly sort them for display).

Tables are grouped into *databases*, and a collection of databases managed by a single EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance constitutes a database *cluster*.

This tutorial walks you through the main features of an RDBMS using a sample database.
