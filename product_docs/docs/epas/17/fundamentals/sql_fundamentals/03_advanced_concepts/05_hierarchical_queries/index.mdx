<div id="hierarchical_queries" class="registered_link"></div>

A *hierarchical query* is a type of query that returns the rows of the result set in a hierarchical order based on data forming a parent-child relationship. A hierarchy is typically represented by an inverted tree structure. The tree is made up of interconnected *nodes*. Each node can be connected to none, one, or multiple *child* nodes. Each node is connected to one *parent* node except for the top node, which has no parent. This node is the *root* node. Each tree has exactly one root node. 

Nodes that don’t have any children are called *leaf* nodes. A tree always has at least one leaf node, for example, the trivial case where the tree is made up of a single node. In this case, the node is both the root and the leaf.

In a hierarchical query, the rows of the result set represent the nodes of one or more trees.

!!! Note
    A single given row can appear in more than one tree and thus appear more than once in the result set.

## Syntax 

The hierarchical relationship in a query is described by the `CONNECT BY` clause, which forms the basis of the order in which rows are returned in the result set. This example shows the context of where the `CONNECT BY` clause and its associated optional clauses appear in the `SELECT` command:

```sql
SELECT <select_list> FROM <table_expression> [ WHERE ...]
  [ START WITH <start_expression> ]
    { CONNECT BY <condition> }
  [ ORDER SIBLINGS BY <column1> [ ASC | DESC ]
      [, <column2> [ ASC | DESC ] ] ...
  [ GROUP BY ...]
  [ HAVING ...]
  [ <other> ...]
```

`select_list` is one or more expressions that make up the fields of the result set. `table_expression` is one or more tables or views from which the rows of the result set originate. `other` is any additional legal `SELECT` command clauses. 

`CONNECT BY` specifies the relationship between a parent record and its child records of the hierarchy. 

-  You can specify the `PRIOR` keyword with only one expression in a condition in the `CONNECT BY` clause. You must specify it with either right or left expression to refer to a parent row in a hierarchical query. For example:

   ```sql
   PRIOR expr = expr
   or
   expr = PRIOR expr
   ```

-  If the `CONNECT BY condition` is compound, only one condition requires the `PRIOR` keyword, although there can be multiple `PRIOR` conditions.

-  You can use the `PRIOR` keyword to evaluate the parent row in a parent-child relationship in a hierarchical query. 

-  You can't use `PRIOR` keyword with unary expressions.

-  You can use the `PRIOR` keyword to add a pseudo-column for each record corresponding to an expression in a target list. The pseudo-column represents a parent record's actual value when referenced in a child query using a `PRIOR` expression.

Use the `CONNECT_BY_ROOT` operator to further enhance the functionality of the `CONNECT BY [PRIOR]` condition. This operator returns not only immediate parent rows but also all ancestors rows in the hierarchy. For more information, see [Retrieving the root node with CONNECT_BY_ROOT](../05_hierarchical_queries/06_retrieving_the_root_node_with_connect_by_root/#retrieving_the_root_node_with_connect_by_root).

## Examples

This example uses the `CONNECT BY` clause with `PRIOR` to define a relationship between employees and managers. Using the `LEVEL` value, the employee names are indented to further emphasize the depth in the hierarchy of each row.

```sql
SELECT LPAD(ename,length(ename)+2 *(LEVEL - 1),' ') AS employee, empno, mgr, LEVEL 
FROM emp 
CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr AND PRIOR emp.deptno = emp.deptno;
```

The output from this query is:

```sql
__OUTPUT__
employee    | empno | mgr  | level 
------------+-------+------+-------
 SMITH      |  7369 | 7902 |     1
 ALLEN      |  7499 | 7698 |     1
 WARD       |  7521 | 7698 |     1
 JONES      |  7566 | 7839 |     1
   FORD     |  7902 | 7566 |     2
     SMITH  |  7369 | 7902 |     3
   SCOTT    |  7788 | 7566 |     2
     ADAMS  |  7876 | 7788 |     3
 MARTIN     |  7654 | 7698 |     1
 BLAKE      |  7698 | 7839 |     1
   WARD     |  7521 | 7698 |     2
   TURNER   |  7844 | 7698 |     2
   MARTIN   |  7654 | 7698 |     2
   JAMES    |  7900 | 7698 |     2
   ALLEN    |  7499 | 7698 |     2
 CLARK      |  7782 | 7839 |     1
   MILLER   |  7934 | 7782 |     2
 SCOTT      |  7788 | 7566 |     1
   ADAMS    |  7876 | 7788 |     2
 KING       |  7839 |      |     1
   CLARK    |  7782 | 7839 |     2
     MILLER |  7934 | 7782 |     3
 TURNER     |  7844 | 7698 |     1
 ADAMS      |  7876 | 7788 |     1
 JAMES      |  7900 | 7698 |     1
 FORD       |  7902 | 7566 |     1
   SMITH    |  7369 | 7902 |     2
 MILLER     |  7934 | 7782 |     1
(28 rows)
```

This example adds the `ORDER BY` clause and a compound condition with `AND` operator in a `CONNECT BY` clause to show employee and manager hierarchy:

```sql
SELECT LPAD(ename,length(ename)+2 *(LEVEL - 1),' ') AS employee, empno, mgr, LEVEL
FROM emp
CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr AND LEVEL <= 3
ORDER BY LEVEL, ename;
```

The output from this query is:

```sql
__OUTPUT__
employee    | empno | mgr  | level 
------------+-------+------+-------
 ADAMS      |  7876 | 7788 |     1
 ALLEN      |  7499 | 7698 |     1
 BLAKE      |  7698 | 7839 |     1
 CLARK      |  7782 | 7839 |     1
 FORD       |  7902 | 7566 |     1
 JAMES      |  7900 | 7698 |     1
 JONES      |  7566 | 7839 |     1
 KING       |  7839 |      |     1
 MARTIN     |  7654 | 7698 |     1
 MILLER     |  7934 | 7782 |     1
 SCOTT      |  7788 | 7566 |     1
 SMITH      |  7369 | 7902 |     1
 TURNER     |  7844 | 7698 |     1
 WARD       |  7521 | 7698 |     1
   ADAMS    |  7876 | 7788 |     2
   ALLEN    |  7499 | 7698 |     2
   BLAKE    |  7698 | 7839 |     2
   CLARK    |  7782 | 7839 |     2
   FORD     |  7902 | 7566 |     2
   JAMES    |  7900 | 7698 |     2
   JONES    |  7566 | 7839 |     2
   MARTIN   |  7654 | 7698 |     2
   MILLER   |  7934 | 7782 |     2
   SCOTT    |  7788 | 7566 |     2
   SMITH    |  7369 | 7902 |     2
   TURNER   |  7844 | 7698 |     2
   WARD     |  7521 | 7698 |     2
     ADAMS  |  7876 | 7788 |     3
     ALLEN  |  7499 | 7698 |     3
     FORD   |  7902 | 7566 |     3
     JAMES  |  7900 | 7698 |     3
     MARTIN |  7654 | 7698 |     3
     MILLER |  7934 | 7782 |     3
     SCOTT  |  7788 | 7566 |     3
     SMITH  |  7369 | 7902 |     3
     TURNER |  7844 | 7698 |     3
     WARD   |  7521 | 7698 |     3
(37 rows)
```

This example uses the `PRIOR` keyword to return the employee name and manager name for each employee:

```sql
SELECT ename, PRIOR ename AS mgr FROM emp START WITH mgr 
IS NULL CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr ORDER BY ename;
```

The output from this query is:

```sql
__OUTPUT__
ename   |  mgr  
--------+-------
 ADAMS  | SCOTT
 ALLEN  | BLAKE
 BLAKE  | KING
 CLARK  | KING
 FORD   | JONES
 JAMES  | BLAKE
 JONES  | KING
 KING   | 
 MARTIN | BLAKE
 MILLER | CLARK
 SCOTT  | JONES
 SMITH  | FORD
 TURNER | BLAKE
 WARD   | BLAKE
(14 rows)
```

This example uses a `CONNECT BY` clause with an optional `PRIOR` statement to show the level value:

```sql
SELECT LEVEL
FROM DUAL
CONNECT BY LEVEL <= 5;
```

The output from this query is:

```sql
__OUTPUT__
level 
--------
     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
(5 rows)
```
