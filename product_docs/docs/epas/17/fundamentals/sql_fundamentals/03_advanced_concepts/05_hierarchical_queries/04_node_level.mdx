<div id="node_level" class="registered_link"></div>

`LEVEL` is a pseudo-column that you can use wherever a column can appear in the `SELECT` command. For each row in the result set, `LEVEL` returns a non-zero integer value designating the depth in the hierarchy of the node represented by this row. The `LEVEL` for root nodes is 1. The `LEVEL` for direct children of root nodes is 2, and so on.

## Example 

The following query is a modification of the previous query with the addition of the `LEVEL` pseudo-column. In addition, using the `LEVEL` value, the employee names are indented to further emphasize the depth in the hierarchy of each row.

```sql
SELECT LEVEL, LPAD (' ', 2 * (LEVEL - 1)) || ename "employee", empno, mgr
FROM emp START WITH mgr IS NULL
CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr;
```

The output from this query is:

```sql
__OUTPUT__
level |  employee   | empno | mgr
------+-------------+-------+------
   1  | KING        |  7839 |
   2  |   JONES     |  7566 | 7839
   3  |     SCOTT   |  7788 | 7566
   4  |       ADAMS |  7876 | 7788
   3  |     FORD    |  7902 | 7566
   4  |       SMITH |  7369 | 7902
   2  |   BLAKE     |  7698 | 7839
   3  |     ALLEN   |  7499 | 7698
   3  |     WARD    |  7521 | 7698
   3  |     MARTIN  |  7654 | 7698
   3  |     TURNER  |  7844 | 7698
   3  |     JAMES   |  7900 | 7698
   2  |   CLARK     |  7782 | 7839
   3  |     MILLER  |  7934 | 7782
(14 rows)
```

Nodes that share a common parent and are at the same level are called *siblings*. For example, in the above output, employees `ALLEN`, `WARD`, `MARTIN`, `TURNER`, and `JAMES` are siblings since they are all at level three with parent `BLAKE`. `JONES`, `BLAKE`, and `CLARK` are siblings since they are at level two and `KING` is their common parent.
