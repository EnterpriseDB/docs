<div id="ordering_the_siblings" class="registered_link"></div>

You can order the result set so the siblings appear in ascending or descending order by selected column values using the `ORDER SIBLINGS BY` clause. This is a special case of the `ORDER BY` clause that you can use only with hierarchical queries.

You can further modify the previous query by adding `ORDER SIBLINGS BY` ename `ASC`.

```sql
SELECT LEVEL, LPAD (' ', 2 * (LEVEL - 1)) || ename "employee", empno, mgr
FROM emp START WITH mgr IS NULL
CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr
ORDER SIBLINGS BY ename ASC;
```

The output from the prior query is now modified so the siblings appear in ascending order by name. Siblings `BLAKE`, `CLARK`, and `JONES` are now alphabetically arranged under `KING`. Siblings `ALLEN`, `JAMES`, `MARTIN`, `TURNER`, and `WARD` are alphabetically arranged under `BLAKE`, and so on.

```sql
__OUTPUT__
level |  employee   | empno | mgr
------+-------------+-------+------
  1   | KING        |  7839 |
  2   |   BLAKE     |  7698 | 7839
  3   |     ALLEN   |  7499 | 7698
  3   |     JAMES   |  7900 | 7698
  3   |     MARTIN  |  7654 | 7698
  3   |     TURNER  |  7844 | 7698
  3   |     WARD    |  7521 | 7698
  2   |   CLARK     |  7782 | 7839
  3   |     MILLER  |  7934 | 7782
  2   |   JONES     |  7566 | 7839
  3   |     FORD    |  7902 | 7566
  4   |       SMITH |  7369 | 7902
  3   |     SCOTT   |  7788 | 7566
  4   |       ADAMS |  7876 | 7788
(14 rows)
```

This final example adds the `WHERE` clause and starts with three root nodes. After the node tree is constructed, the `WHERE` clause filters out rows in the tree to form the result set.

```sql
SELECT LEVEL, LPAD (' ', 2 * (LEVEL - 1)) || ename "employee", empno, mgr
FROM emp WHERE mgr IN (7839, 7782, 7902, 7788)
START WITH ename IN ('BLAKE','CLARK','JONES')
CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr
ORDER SIBLINGS BY ename ASC;
```

The output from the query shows three root nodes (level one): `BLAKE`, `CLARK`, and `JONES`. In addition, rows that don't satisfy the `WHERE` clause were eliminated from the output.

```sql
__OUTPUT__
level | employee  | empno | mgr
------+-----------+-------+------
  1   | BLAKE     |  7698 | 7839
  1   | CLARK     |  7782 | 7839
  2   |   MILLER  |  7934 | 7782
  1   | JONES     |  7566 | 7839
  3   |     SMITH |  7369 | 7902
  3   |     ADAMS |  7876 | 7788
(6 rows)
```
