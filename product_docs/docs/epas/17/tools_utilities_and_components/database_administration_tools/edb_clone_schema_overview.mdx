EDB Clone Schema is an extension module for EDB Postgres Advanced Server that allows you to copy a schema and its database objects from a local or remote database (the source database) to a receiving database (the target database).

The source and target databases can be either:

-  The same physical database 
-  Different databases in the same database cluster
-  Separate databases running under different database clusters on separate database server hosts

For details about using the tool, see [Copying a database](../../database_administration/14_edb_clone_schema/).
