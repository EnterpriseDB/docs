EDB Resource Manager is an EDB Postgres Advanced Server feature that lets you control the use of operating system resources used by EDB Postgres Advanced Server processes.

This capability allows you to protect the system from processes that might uncontrollably overuse and monopolize certain system resources.

For details about using the utility, see [Throttling CPU and I/O at the process level](../../database_administration/10_edb_resource_manager/).
