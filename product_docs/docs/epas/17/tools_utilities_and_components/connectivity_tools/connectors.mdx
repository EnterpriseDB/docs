We package and support a number of components to connect to your EDB Postgres Advanced Server database server. These EDB components are enhanced versions of the corresponding PostgreSQL components and are intended to support additional EDB Postgres Advanced Server capabilities.     

The EDB components for connecting to your database include:

- [EDB JDBC Connector](/jdbc_connector/latest/) &mdash; Provides connectivity between a Java application and a Postgres database server. 

- [EDB .NET Connector](/net_connector/latest/) &mdash; Provides connectivity between a .NET client application and a Postgres database server

- [EDB OCL Connector](/jdbc_connector/latest/) &mdash; Provides an API similar to the Oracle Call Interface that you can use to interact with a Postgres database server.

- [EDB ODBC Connector](/odbc_connector/latest/) &mdash; Allows an ODBC-compliant client application to connect to a Postgres database server

You can use the PostgreSQL community components with EDB Postgres Advanced Server. However, if your applications require EDB Postgres Advanced Server features, use the EDB components.
