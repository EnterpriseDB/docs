We package and support a number of open source components you can use to connect to as well as manage your Postgres database. In addition, we package and support open-source components to connect your server to external data sources. These EDB components are enhanced versions of the corresponding PostgreSQL components and are intended to support additional EDB Postgres Advanced Server capabilities.
