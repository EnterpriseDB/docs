The following features have been changed in EDB Postgres Advanced Server 10 to create Advanced Server 11:

-   Advanced Server no longer supports the PL/Java package. The PL/Java package is deprecated in EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11 and will be unavailable in EDB Postgres Advanced Server 12. For more information, see Chapter 10. 
-   Advanced Server no longer supports the Infinite Cache feature. All related components have been removed such as the functions, scripts, configuration parameters, and columns from statistical tables and views.
-   Advanced Server no longer creates the `dbo` system catalog in its databases. For more information, see Section 11.3.
-   Advanced Server now supports *data redaction*, which is a technique for limiting the exposure of sensitive data to certain users. Data redaction results in the alteration of the displayed data to such users. This is accomplished by defining redaction policies for tables with sensitive data. For more information, see Section 4.4.
-   Advanced Server now supports *EDB wait states*, which is a background worker that probes each running session at a regular interval collecting information such as the database connection, the logged in user, the running query, and the wait events. For more information, see Section 8.2.
-   Advanced Server now permits an infinite number of tries for custom plan generation by setting the `edb_custom_plan_tries` parameter to `-1`. For more information, see Section 3.1.3.5.1.
-   The output format of the `version()` function has been changed to appear more consistent with the PostgreSQL community version output. For more information see Section 11.2.
-   You can use the `edb_filter_log.redact_password_commands` extension to instruct the server to redact stored passwords from the log file. For more information, see Section 3.5.7.
