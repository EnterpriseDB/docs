The following features have been changed in EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11 to create Advanced Server 12:

-   Advanced Server introduces `COMPOUND TRIGGERS`, which are stored as a PL block that executes in response to a specified triggering event. For information, see the *Database Compatibility Stored Procedural Language Guide*.
-   Advanced Server now supports new `DATA DICTIONARY VIEWS` that provide information that is compatible with the Oracle data dictionary views. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Catalog Views Guide*.
-   Advanced Server has added the `LISTAGG` function to support string aggregation that concatenates data from multiple rows into a single row in an ordered manner. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's Reference Guide*.
-   Advanced Server now supports `CAST(MULTISET)` function, allowing subquery output to be `CAST` to a nested table type. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's Reference Guide*.
-   Advanced Server has added the `MEDIAN` function to calculate a median value from the set of provided values. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's Reference Guide*.
-   Advanced Server has added the `SYS_GUID` function to generate and return a globally unique identifier in the form of `16-bytes` of `RAW` data. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's Reference Guide*.
-   Advanced Server now supports an Oracle-compatible `SELECT UNIQUE` clause in addition to an existing `SELECT DISTINCT` clause. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers SQL Guide *.
-   Advanced Server has re-implemented `default_with_rowids`, which is used to create a table that includes a `ROWID` column in the newly created table. For more information, see [default_with_rowids](../03_database_administration/01_configuration_parameters/03_configuration_parameters_by_functionality/11_compatibility_options/#default_with_rowids). 
-   Advanced Server now supports logical decoding on the standby server, which allows creating a logical replication slot on a standby, independently of a primary server. For more information, see [Logical Decoding on Standby](../15_enhanced_sql_and_other_misc_features/#logical_decoding_on_standby).
-   Advanced Server introduces `INTERVAL PARTITIONING`, which allows a database to automatically create partitions of a specified interval as new data is inserted into a table. For information, see the *Database Compatibility Table Partitioning Guide*.
