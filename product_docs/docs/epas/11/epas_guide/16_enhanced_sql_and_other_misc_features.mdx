Advanced Server includes enhanced SQL functionality and various other features that provide additional flexibility and convenience. This chapter discusses some of these additions.

## COMMENT

In addition to commenting on objects supported by the PostgreSQL `COMMENT` command, Advanced Server supports comments on additional object types. The complete supported syntax is:

```text
COMMENT ON
{
  AGGREGATE <aggregate_name> ( <aggregate_signature> ) |
  CAST (<source_type> AS <target_type>) |
  COLLATION <object_name> |
  COLUMN <relation_name>.<column_name> |
  CONSTRAINT <constraint_name> ON <table_name> |
  CONSTRAINT <constraint_name> ON DOMAIN <domain_name> |
  CONVERSION <object_name> |
  DATABASE <object_name> |
  DOMAIN <object_name> |
  EXTENSION <object_name> |
  EVENT TRIGGER <object_name> |
  FOREIGN DATA WRAPPER <object_name> |
  FOREIGN TABLE <object_name> |
  FUNCTION <func_name> ([[<argmode>] [<argname>] <argtype> [,...]])|
  INDEX <object_name> |
  LARGE OBJECT <large_object_oid> |
  MATERIALIZED VIEW <object_name> |
  OPERATOR <operator_name> (left_type, right_type) |
  OPERATOR CLASS <object_name> USING <index_method> |
  OPERATOR FAMILY <object_name> USING <index_method> |
  PACKAGE <object_name>
  POLICY <policy_name> ON <table_name> |
  [ PROCEDURAL ] LANGUAGE <object_name> |
  PROCEDURE <proc_name> [([[<argmode>] [<argname>] <argtype> [, ...]])]
  PUBLIC SYNONYM <object_name>
  ROLE <object_name> |
  RULE <rule_name> ON <table_name> |
  SCHEMA <object_name> |
  SEQUENCE <object_name> |
  SERVER <object_name> |
  TABLE <object_name> |
  TABLESPACE <object_name> |
  TEXT SEARCH CONFIGURATION <object_name> |
  TEXT SEARCH DICTIONARY <object_name> |
  TEXT SEARCH PARSER <object_name> |
  TEXT SEARCH TEMPLATE <object_name> |
  TRANSFORM FOR <type_name> LANGUAGE <lang_name> |
  TRIGGER <trigger_name> ON <table_name> |
  TYPE <object_name> |
  VIEW <object_name>
} IS <'text'>
```

where `aggregate_signature` is:

```text
* |
[ <argmode> ] [ <argname> ] <argtype> [ , ... ] |
[ [ <argmode> ] [ <argname> ] <argtype> [ , ... ] ]
ORDER BY [ <argmode> ] [ <argname> ] <argtype> [ , ... ]
```

**Parameters**

`object_name`

The name of the object on which you are commenting.

`AGGREGATE aggregate_name (aggregate_signature)`

Include the `AGGREGATE` clause to create a comment about an aggregate. `aggregate_name` specifies the name of an aggregate, and `aggregate_signature` specifies the associated signature in one of the following forms:

```text
* |
[ <argmode> ] [ <argname> ] <argtype> [ , ... ] |
[ [ <argmode> ] [ <argname> ] <argtype> [ , ... ] ]
ORDER BY [ <argmode> ] [ <argname> ] <argtype> [ , ... ]
```

Where `argmode` is the mode of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument, argmode may be `IN`, `OUT`, `INOUT`, or `VARIADIC`. If omitted, the default is `IN`.

`argname` is the name of an aggregate argument.

`argtype` is the data type of an aggregate argument.

`CAST (source_type AS target_type)`

Include the `CAST` clause to create a comment about a cast. When creating a comment about a cast, `source_type` specifies the source data type of the cast, and `target_type` specifies the target data type of the cast.

`COLUMN relation_name.column_name`

Include the `COLUMN` clause to create a comment about a column. `column_name` specifies name of the column to which the comment applies. `relation_name` is the table, view, composite type, or foreign table in which a column resides.

`CONSTRAINT constraint_name ON table_name`

`CONSTRAINT constraint_name ON DOMAIN domain_name`

Include the `CONSTRAINT` clause to add a comment about a constraint. When creating a comment about a constraint, `constraint_name` specifies the name of the constraint. `table_name` or `domain_name` specifies the name of the table or domain on which the constraint is defined.

`FUNCTION func_name ([[argmode] [argname] argtype [, ...]])`

Include the `FUNCTION` clause to add a comment about a function. `func_name` specifies the name of the function. `argmode` specifies the mode of the function. `argmode` may be `IN`, `OUT`, `INOUT`, or `VARIADIC`. If omitted, the default is `IN`.

`argname` specifies the name of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument. `argtype` specifies the data type of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument.

`large_object_oid`

`large_object_oid` is the system-assigned OID of the large object about which you are commenting.

`OPERATOR operator_name (left_type, right_type)`

Include the `OPERATOR` clause to add a comment about an operator. `operator_name` specifies the (optionally schema-qualified) name of an operator on which you are commenting. `left_type` and `right_type` are the (optionally schema-qualified) data type(s) of the operator's arguments.

`OPERATOR CLASS object_name USING index_method`

Include the `OPERATOR CLASS` clause to add a comment about an operator class. `object_name` specifies the (optionally schema-qualified) name of an operator on which you are commenting. `index_method` specifies the associated index method of the operator class.

`OPERATOR FAMILY object_name USING index_method`

Include the `OPERATOR FAMILY` clause to add a comment about an operator family. `object_name` specifies the (optionally schema-qualified) name of an operator family on which you are commenting. `index_method` specifies the associated index method of the operator family.

`POLICY policy_name ON table_name`

Include the `POLICY` clause to add a comment about a policy. `policy_name` specifies the name of the policy, and `table_name` specifies the table that the policy is associated with.

`PROCEDURE proc_name [([[argmode] [argname] argtype [, ...]])]`

Include the `PROCEDURE` clause to add a comment about a procedure. `proc_name` specifies the name of the procedure. `argmode` specifies the mode of the procedure. `argmode` may be `IN`, `OUT`, `INOUT`, or `VARIADIC`. If omitted, the default is `IN`.

`argname` specifies the name of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument. `argtype` specifies the data type of a function, procedure, or aggregate argument.

`RULE rule_name ON table_name`

Include the `RULE` clause to specify a `COMMENT` on a rule. `rule_name` specifies the name of the rule, and `table_name` specifies the name of the table on which the rule is defined.

`TRANSFORM FOR type_name LANGUAGE lang_name`

Include the `TRANSFORM FOR` clause to specify a `COMMENT` on a `TRANSFORM`.

`type_name` specifies the name of the data type of the transform and `lang_name` specifies the name of the language of the transform.

`TRIGGER trigger_name ON table_name`

Include the `TRIGGER` clause to specify a `COMMENT` on a trigger. `trigger_name` specifies the name of the trigger, and `table_name` specifies the name of the table on which the trigger is defined.

`text`

The comment, written as a string literal or `NULL` to drop the comment.

**Notes:**

Names of tables, aggregates, collations, conversions, domains, foreign tables, functions, indexes, operators, operator classes, operator families, packages, procedures, sequences, text search objects, types, and views can be schema-qualified.

**Example:**

The following example adds a comment to a table named `new_emp`:

```text
COMMENT ON TABLE new_emp IS 'This table contains information about new
employees.';
```

For more information about using the `COMMENT` command, see the PostgreSQL core documentation at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/sql-comment.html>

## Output of Function version()

The text string output of the `version()` function displays the name of the product, its version, and the host system on which it has been installed.

For Advanced Server, the `version()` output is in a format similar to the PostgreSQL community version in that the first text word is *PostgreSQL* instead of *EnterpriseDB* as in Advanced Server version 10 and earlier.

The general format of the version() output is the following:

```text
PostgreSQL $PG_VERSION_EXT (EnterpriseDB Advanced Server $PG_VERSION) on $host
```

So for the current Advanced Server the version string appears as follows:

```text
edb@45032=#select version();
version
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------------------------------------
PostgreSQL 11.0 (EnterpriseDB Advanced Server 11.0.0) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc 
(GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-11), 64-bit
(1 row)
```

In contrast, for Advanced Server 10, the version string was the following:

```text
edb=# select version();
                                                version
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-----------------
EnterpriseDB 10.4.9 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (GCC) 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 
4.4.7-18), 64-bit
(1 row)
```
## SQL Server dbo schema

Prior to Advanced Server 11, a system catalog named `dbo` was available. The `dbo` system catalog contained views of database objects for similarity with Microsoft SQL Server.

Now, for Advanced Server neither the `dbo` system catalog nor a schema named `dbo` exist in any database.

If it is desired to have such a schema with its SQL Server compatible views, use the `CREATE EXTENSION edb_dbo` command to create the `dbo` schema and its content.

The following example shows the creation of the `dbo` schema and its views:

```text
edb=# CREATE EXTENSION edb_dbo;
CREATE EXTENSION
edb=# \dn
    List of Schemas
  Name   |    Owner
  -------+--------------
  dbo    | enterprisedb
  public | enterprisedb

edb=# SET search_path TO dbo;
SET
edb=# \dv
                List of relations
  Schema |   Name      | Type |   Owner
---------+-------------+------+-------------
  dbo    | sysinedexes | view | enterprisedb
  dbo    | sysobjects  | view | enterprisedb
  dbo    | systables   | view | enterprisedb
  dbo    | systypes    | view | enterprisedb
  dbo    | sysusers    | view | enterprisedb
(5 rows)
```
