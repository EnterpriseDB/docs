Advanced Server includes an extension that you can use to exclude log file entries that include a user-specified error code from the Advanced Server log files. To filter audit log entries, you must first enable the extension by modifying the `postgresql.conf` file, adding the following value to the values specified in the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter:

```text
$libdir/edb_filter_log
```

Then, use the `edb_filter_log.errcodes` parameter to specify any error codes you wish to omit from the log files:

```text
edb_filter_log.errcode = 'error_code'
```

Where `error_code` specifies one or more error codes that you wish to omit from the log file. Provide multiple error codes in a comma-delimited list.

For example, if `edb_filter_log` is enabled, and `edb_filter_log.errcode` is set to `'23505,23502,22012'`, any log entries that return one of the following `SQLSTATE` errors:

`23505` (for violating a unique constraint)

`23502` (for violating a not-null constraint)

`22012` (for dividing by zero)

will be omitted from the log file.

For a complete list of the error codes supported by Advanced Server audit log filtering, see the core documentation at:
