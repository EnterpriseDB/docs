The Index Advisor shared library interacts with the query planner to make indexing recommendations. On Windows, the Advanced Server installer creates the following shared library in the `libdir` subdirectory of your Advanced Server home directory. For Linux, install the `edb-asxx-server-indexadvisor` RPM package where `xx` is the Advanced Server version number.

On Linux:

`index_advisor.so`

On Windows:

`index_advisor.dll`

Please note that libraries in the `libdir` directory can only be loaded by a superuser. A database administrator can allow a non-superuser to use Index Advisor by manually copying the Index Advisor file from the `libdir` directory into the `libdir/plugins` directory (under your Advanced Server home directory). Only a trusted non-superuser should be allowed access to the plugin; this is an unsafe practice in a production environment.

The installer also creates the Index Advisor utility program and setup script:

`pg_advise_index`

 `pg_advise_index` is a utility program that reads a user-supplied input file containing SQL queries and produces a text file containing `CREATE INDEX` statements that can be used to create the indexes recommended by the Index Advisor. The `pg_advise_index` program is located in the `bin` subdirectory of the Advanced Server home directory.

`index_advisor.sql`

 `index_advisor.sql` is a script that creates a permanent Index Advisor log table along with a function and view to facilitate reporting of recommendations from the log table. The script is located in the `share/contrib` subdirectory of the Advanced Server directory.

 The `index_advisor.sql` script creates the `index_advisor_log` table, the `show_index_recommendations()` function and the `index_recommendations` view. These database objects must be created in a schema that is accessible by, and included in the search path of the role that will invoke Index Advisor.

`index_advisor_log`

 Index Advisor logs indexing recommendations in the `index_advisor_log` table. If Index Advisor does not find the `index_advisor_log` table in the user's search path, Index Advisor will store any indexing recommendations in a temporary table of the same name. The temporary table exists only for the duration of the current session.

`show_index_recommendations()`

 `show_index_recommendations()` is a PL/pgSQL function that interprets and displays the recommendations made during a specific Index Advisor session (as identified by its backend process ID).

`index_recommendations`

 Index Advisor creates the `index_recommendations` view based on information stored in the `index_advisor_log` table during a query analysis. The view produces output in the same format as the `show_index_recommendations()` function, but contains Index Advisor recommendations for all stored sessions, while the result set returned by the `show_index_recommendations()` function are limited to a specified session.
