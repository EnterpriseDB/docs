This is the minimum number of seconds after which the `autoprewarm` background worker dumps shared buffers to disk. The default is 300 seconds. If set to 0, shared buffers are not dumped at regular intervals, but only when the server is shut down.

See the [pg_prewarm.autoprewarm](16_pg_prewarm.autoprewarm/#pg_prewarm_autoprewarm) for information on the `autoprewarm` background worker.
