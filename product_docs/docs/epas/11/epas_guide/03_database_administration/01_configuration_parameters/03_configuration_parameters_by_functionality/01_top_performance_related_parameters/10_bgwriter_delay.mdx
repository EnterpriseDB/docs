**Parameter Type:** Integer

**Range:** 10ms to 10000ms

**Minimum Scope of Effect:** Cluster

**Required Authorization to Activate:** EPAS service account

Specifies the delay between activity rounds for the background writer. In each round the writer issues writes for some number of dirty buffers (controllable by the `bgwriter_lru_maxpages` and `bgwriter_lru_multiplier` parameters). It then sleeps for `bgwriter_delay` milliseconds, and repeats.

The default value is 200 milliseconds (200ms). Note that on many systems, the effective resolution of sleep delays is 10 milliseconds; setting `bgwriter_delay` to a value that is not a multiple of 10 might have the same results as setting it to the next higher multiple of 10.

Typically, when tuning `bgwriter_delay`, it should be reduced from its default value. This parameter is rarely increased, except perhaps to save on power consumption on a system with very low utilization.
