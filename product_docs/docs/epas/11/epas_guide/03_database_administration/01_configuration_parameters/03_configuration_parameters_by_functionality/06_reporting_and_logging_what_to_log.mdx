Use with the optimizer hints feature to provide more detailed information regarding whether or not a hint was used by the planner. Set the `client_min_messages` and `trace_hints` configuration parameters as follows:

```text
SET client_min_messages TO info;
SET trace_hints TO true;
```

The `SELECT` command with the `NO_INDEX` hint shown below illustrates the additional information produced when the aforementioned configuration parameters are set.

```text
EXPLAIN SELECT /*+ NO_INDEX(accounts accounts_pkey) */ * FROM accounts
WHERE aid = 100;

INFO: [HINTS] Index Scan of [accounts].[accounts_pkey] rejected because
of NO_INDEX hint.

INFO: [HINTS] Bitmap Heap Scan of [accounts].[accounts_pkey] rejected
because of NO_INDEX hint.

Bulk processing logs the resulting statements into both the Advanced Server log file and the EDB Audit log file. However, logging each and every statement in bulk processing is costly. This can be controlled by the `edb_log_every_bulk_value` configuration parameter. When set to `true`, each and every statement in bulk processing is logged. When set to `false`, a log message is recorded once per bulk processing. In addition, the duration is emitted once per bulk processing. Default is set to `false`.
