EnterpriseDB has enhanced ECPG (the PostgreSQL pre-compiler) to create ECPGPlus. ECPGPlus allows you to include Pro*C compatible embedded SQL commands in C applications when connected to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server (Advanced Server) database. When you use ECPGPlus to compile an application, the SQL code is syntax-checked and translated into C.

ECPGPlus supports:

  - Oracle Dynamic SQL – Method 4 (ODS-M4).
  - Pro*C compatible anonymous blocks.
  - A `CALL` statement compatible with Oracle databases.

As part of ECPGPlus's Pro*C compatibility, you do not need to include the `BEGIN DECLARE SECTION` and `END DECLARE SECTION` directives.

**PostgreSQL Compatibility**

While most ECPGPlus statements will work with community PostgreSQL, the `CALL` statement, and the `EXECUTE…END EXEC1` statement work only when the client application is connected to EDB Postgres Advanced Server.
