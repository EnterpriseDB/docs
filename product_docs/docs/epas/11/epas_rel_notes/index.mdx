## EDB Postgres Advanced Server v11 Features

The major highlights of this release are :

-   Advanced Server no longer creates the `dbo` system catalog in its databases. 
-   Advanced Server now supports data redaction. Data redaction is a technique for limiting the exposure of sensitive data to certain users. Data redaction results in the alteration of the displayed data to such users. This is accomplished by defining redaction policies for tables with sensitive data. 
-   You can use the `edb_filter_log.redact_password_commands` extension to instruct the server to redact stored passwords from the log file.
-   Advanced Server now supports EDB wait states, which is a background worker that probes each running session at a regular interval collecting information such as the database connection, the logged in user, the running query, and the wait events. 
-   Advanced Server now permits an infinite number of tries for custom plan generation if you set the `edb_custom_plan_tries` parameter to `-1`.
-   The output format of the `version()` function has been changed to appear more consistent with the PostgreSQL community version output.
-   Advanced Server now supports SPL standalone procedure overloading. Note that this feature is not compatible with Oracle databases.
-   Advanced Server now supports the `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` directive within any SPL block to provide the autonomous transaction capability.
-   Advanced server now offers performance improvements to libpq dblink and the OCI.

For information about Advanced Server features that are compatible with Oracle databases, see the following guides:

### Community PostgreSQL 11 Updates

Advanced Server 11 integrates all of the community PostgreSQL 11 features. To review a complete list of changes to the community PostgreSQL project and the contributors names, see the PostgreSQL 11 Release Notes at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/release-11.html>

The following updates are available in PostgreSQL 11:

### Partitioning Updates

Allow faster partition elimination during query processing; this speeds access to partitioned tables with many partitions.

Allow partition elimination during query execution.

Allow the creation of partitions based on hashing a key.

Allow updated rows to automatically move to new partitions based on the new row contents.

Allow partitioned tables to have a default partition.

Allow `UNIQUE` indexes on partitioned tables if the partition key guarantees uniqueness.

Allow indexes on a partitioned table to be automatically created in any child partitions. The new command `ALTER INDEX ATTACH PARTITION` allows indexes to be attached to partitions. This does not behave as a global index since the contents are private to each index. `WARN WHEN USING AN EXISTING INDEX?`

Allow foreign keys on partitioned tables.

Allow `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, and `COPY` on partitioned tables to properly route rows to foreign partitions.

This is supported by `postgres_fdw` foreign tables.

Allow `FOR EACH ROW` triggers on partitioned tables.

Allow equality joins between partitioned tables with identically partitioned child tables to join the child tables directly.

Perform aggregation on each partition, and then merge the results.

Allow `postgres_fdw` to push down aggregates to foreign tables that are partitions.

### Parallel Queries

Allow btree indexes to be built in parallel.

Allow hash joins to be performed in parallel using a shared hash table.

Allow `UNION` to run each `SELECT` in parallel if the individual SELECTs cannot be parallelized.

Allow partition scans to more efficiently use parallel workers.

Allow `LIMIT` to be passed to parallel workers.

Allow single-evaluation queries, e.g. `WHERE` clause aggregate queries, and functions in the target list to be parallelized.

Add server option `parallel_leader_participation` to control if the leader executes subplans.

Allow parallelization of commands `CREATE TABLE .. AS`, `SELECT INTO`, and `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW`.

Improve performance of sequential scans with many parallel workers.

Add reporting of parallel worker sort activity to `EXPLAIN`.

### Indexes

Allow indexes to `INCLUDE` columns that are not part of the unique constraint but are available for index-only scans.

This is also useful for including columns that don't have btree support.

Remember the highest btree index page to optimize future monotonically increasing index additions.

Allow entire hash index pages to be scanned.

Previously for each hash index entry, we need to refind the scan position within the page. This cuts down on lock/unlock traffic.

Add predicate locking for hash, GiST and GIN indexes.

Allow heap-only-tuple (HOT) updates for expression indexes when the values of the expressions are unchanged.

### SP-Gist

Add `TEXT` prefix operator ^@ which is supported by SP-GiST.

Allow polygons to be indexed with SP-GiST.

Allow SP-GiST to use lossy representation of leaf keys.

### Optimizer

Improve the selection of the optimizer statistics' most-common-values.

Improve selectivity estimates for `>=` and `<=` when the constants are not common values.

Optimize `var = var` to `var IS NOT NULL` where equivalent.

Improve row count optimizer estimates for `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` queries.

Add optimizer selectivity costs for `HAVING` clauses.

### General Performance

Add Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation of some parts of query plans to improve execution speed.

Allow bitmap scans to perform index-only scans when possible.

Update the free space map during vacuum.

Allow vacuum to avoid unnecessary index scans.

Improve performance of committing multiple concurrent transactions.

Reduce memory usage for queries using set-returning functions in their target lists.

Allow `postgres_fdw` to push UPDATEs and DELETEs using joins to foreign servers.

### Monitoring

Show memory usage in `log_statement_stats`, `log_parser_stats`, `log_planner_stats`, `log_executor_stats`.

Add `pg_stat_activity.backend_type` now shows the type of background worker.

Add `bgw_type` to the background worker C structure. This is displayed to the user in `pg_stat_activity.backend_type` and ps output.

Have `log_autovacuum_min_duration` log skipped tables that are concurrently being dropped.

### Information Schema

Add `information_schema` columns related to table constraints and triggers.

### Authentication

Allow the server to specify more complex LDAP specifications in search+bind mode.

Allow LDAP authentication to use ldaps.

Improve LDAP logging of errors.

### Permissions

Add default roles which control file system access.

Allow access to file system functions to be controlled by `GRANT/REVOKE` permissions, rather than superuser checks.

Use `GRANT/REVOKE` to control access to `lo_import()` and `lo_export()`.

Compile-time option `ALLOW_DANGEROUS_LO_FUNCTIONS` has been removed.

Use viewowner not session owner when preventing non-password access to `postgres_fdw` tables.

Fix invalid locking permission check in `SELECT FOR UPDATE` on views.

### Server Configuration

Add server setting `ssl_passphrase_command` to allow supplying of the passphrase for SSL key files.

Add storage parameter `toast_tuple_target` to control the minimum length before `TOAST` storage will be considered for new rows.

Allow server options related to memory and file sizes to be specified as number of bytes.

### Write-Ahead Log (WAL)

Allow the WAL file size to be set via initdb.

No longer retain WAL that spans two checkpoints.

Fill the unused portion of force-switched WAL segment files with zeros for improved compressibility.

### Base Backup and Streaming Replication

Replicate `TRUNCATE` activity when using logical replication.

Pass prepared transaction information to logical replication subscribers.

Exclude unlogged tables, temporary tables, and `pg_internal.init` files from streaming base backups.

Allow heap pages checksums to be checked during streaming base backup.

Allow replication slots to be advanced programmatically, rather than be consumed by subscribers.

Add timeline information to the `backup_label` file.

Add host and port connection information to the `pg_stat_wal_receiver` system view.

### Window Functions

Add window function features to complete SQL:2011 compliance.

### Utility Commands

Allow `ALTER TABLE` to add a column with a non-null default without a table rewrite.

Allow views to be locked by locking the underlying tables.

Allow `ALTER INDEX` to set statistics-gathering targets for expression indexes.

In psql, \d+ now shows the statistics target for indexes.

Allow multiple tables to be specified in one `VACUUM` or `ANALYZE` command. Also, if any table mentioned in VACUUM uses a column list, then the `ANALYZE` keyword must be supplied; previously, `ANALYZE` was implied in such cases.

Add parenthesized options syntax to `ANALYZE`. This is similar to the syntax supported by `VACUUM`.

Add `CREATE AGGREGATE` option to specify the behavior of the aggregate finalization function.

### Data Types

Allow the creation of arrays of domains.

Support domains over composite types.

Add casts from jsonb scalars to numeric and boolean data types.

### Functions

Add SHA-2 family of hash functions; specifically, `sha224()`, `sha256()`, `sha384()`, `sha512()` were added.

Add support for 64-bit non-cryptographic hash functions.

Allow `to_char()` and `to_timestamp()` to specify the time zone's hours and minutes from UTC.

Improve the speed of aggregate computations.

Add text search function `websearch_to_tsquery()` that supports a query syntax similar to that used by web search engines.

Add function `json(b)_to_tsvector()` to create a text search query for matching JSON/JSONB values.

### Server-Side Languages

Add SQL-level procedures, which can start and commit their own transactions. They are created with the new `CREATE PROCEDURE` command and invoked via `CALL`. The new `ALTER/DROP ROUTINE` commands allows altering/dropping of procedures, functions, and aggregates.

Add transaction control to PL/pgSQL, PL/Perl, PL/Python, PL/Tcl, and SPI server-side languages.

Add the ability to define PL/pgSQL record types as not null, constant, or with initial values.

Allow PL/pgSQL to handle changes to composite types (e.g. record, row) that happen between the first and later function executions in the same session. Previously such circumstances generated errors.

Add extension `jsonb_plpython` to transform JSONB to/from PL/Python types.

Add extension `jsonb_plperl` to transform JSONB to/from PL/Perl types.

### Client Interface

Change libpq to disable compression by default.

Add `DO CONTINUE` action to the `ECPG WHENEVER` statement.

Add ecpg mode to enable Oracle Pro*C handling of char arrays.

This mode is enabled with -C.

### Client Applications

**psql**

Add psql command `\gdesc` to display the column names and types of the query output.

Add psql variables to report query activity and errors.

Allow psql to test for the existence of a variable.

Add `PSQL_PAGER` to control psql's pager.
