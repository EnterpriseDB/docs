The `DBMS_JOB` package provides for the creation, scheduling, and managing of jobs. A job runs a stored procedure which has been previously stored in the database. The `SUBMIT` procedure is used to create and store a job definition. A job identifier is assigned to a job along with its associated stored procedure and the attributes describing when and how often the job is to be run.

This package relies on the `pgAgent` scheduler. By default, the Advanced Server installer installs `pgAgent`, but you must start the `pgAgent` service manually prior to using `DBMS_JOB`. If you attempt to use this package to schedule a job after un-installing `pgAgent, DBMS_JOB` will throw an error. `DBMS_JOB` verifies that `pgAgent` is installed, but does not verify that the service is running.

The following table lists the supported `DBMS_JOB` procedures:

| Function/Procedure                                               | Return Type | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BROKEN(job, broken [, next_date ])`                             | n/a         | Specify that a given job is either broken or not broken.                                                                                                    |
| `CHANGE(job, what, next_date, interval, instance, force>)`       | n/a         | Change the job’s parameters.                                                                                                                                |
| `INTERVAL(job, interval)`                                        | n/a         | Set the execution frequency by means of a date function that is recalculated each time the job is run. This value becomes the next date/time for execution. |
| `NEXT_DATE(job, next_date)`                                      | n/a         | Set the next date/time the job is to be run.                                                                                                                |
| `REMOVE(job)`                                                    | n/a         | Delete the job definition from the database.                                                                                                                |
| `RUN(job)`                                                       | n/a         | Forces execution of a job even if it is marked broken.                                                                                                      |
| `SUBMIT(job OUT, what [, next_date [, interval [, no_parse ]]])` | n/a         | Creates a job and stores its definition in the database.                                                                                                    |
| `WHAT(job, what)`                                                | n/a         | Change the stored procedure run by a job.                                                                                                                   |

Advanced Server's implementation of `DBMS_JOB` is a partial implementation when compared to Oracle's version. Only those functions and procedures listed in the table above are supported.

Before using `DBMS_JOB`, a database superuser must create the `pgAgent` extension. Use the `psql` client to connect to a database and invoke the command:

```text
CREATE EXTENSION pgagent;
```

When and how often a job is run is dependent upon two interacting parameters – `next_date` and `interval`. The `next_date` parameter is a date/time value that specifies the next date/time when the job is to be executed. The `interval` parameter is a string that contains a date function that evaluates to a date/time value.

Just prior to any execution of the job, the expression in the `interval` parameter is evaluated. The resulting value replaces the `next_date` value stored with the job. The job is then executed. In this manner, the expression in `interval` is repeatedly re-evaluated prior to each job execution, supplying the `next_date` date/time for the next execution.

!!! Note
    The database user must be the same that created a job and schedule to start the `pgAgent` server and execute the job.

The following examples use the following stored procedure, `job_proc`, which simply inserts a timestamp into table, `jobrun`, containing a single `VARCHAR2` column.

```text
CREATE TABLE jobrun (
    runtime VARCHAR2(40)
);

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE job_proc
IS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO jobrun VALUES ('job_proc run at ' || TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,
        'yyyy-mm-dd hh24:mi:ss'));
END;
```
