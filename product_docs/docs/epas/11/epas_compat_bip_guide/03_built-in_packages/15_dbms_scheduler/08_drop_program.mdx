```

**Parameters**

`program_name`

 `program_name` specifies the name of the program that is being dropped.

`force`

 `force` is a `BOOLEAN` value that instructs the server how to handle programs with dependent jobs.

-   Specify `FALSE` to instruct the server to return an error if the program is referenced by a job.

-   Specify `TRUE` to instruct the server to disable any jobs that reference the program before dropping the program.

    The default value is `FALSE`.
