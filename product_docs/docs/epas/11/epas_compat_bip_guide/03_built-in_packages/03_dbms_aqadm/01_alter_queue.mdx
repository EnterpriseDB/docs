Use the `ALTER_QUEUE` procedure to modify an existing queue. The signature is:

```text
ALTER_QUEUE(
  <max_retries> IN NUMBER DEFAULT NULL,
  <retry_delay> IN NUMBER DEFAULT 0
  <retention_time> IN NUMBER DEFAULT 0,
  <auto_commit> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE)
  <comment> IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL,
```

**Parameters**

`queue_name`

 The name of the new queue.

`max_retries`

 `max_retries` specifies the maximum number of attempts to remove a message with a dequeue statement. The value of `max_retries` is incremented with each `ROLLBACK` statement. When the number of failed attempts reaches the value specified by `max_retries`, the message is moved to the exception queue. Specify `0` to indicate that no retries are allowed.

`retry_delay`

 `retry_delay` specifies the number of seconds until a message is scheduled for re-processing after a `ROLLBACK`. Specify `0` to indicate that the message should be retried immediately (the default).

`retention_time`

 `retention_time` specifies the length of time (in seconds) that a message will be stored after being dequeued. You can also specify `0` (the default) to indicate the message should not be retained after dequeueing, or `INFINITE` to retain the message forever.

`auto_commit`

 This parameter is accepted for compatibility and ignored.

`comment`

 `comment` specifies a comment associated with the queue.

**Example**

The following command alters a queue named `work_order`, setting the `retry_delay` parameter to 5 seconds:

```text
EXEC DBMS_AQADM.ALTER_QUEUE(queue_name => 'work_order', retry_delay => 5);
```
