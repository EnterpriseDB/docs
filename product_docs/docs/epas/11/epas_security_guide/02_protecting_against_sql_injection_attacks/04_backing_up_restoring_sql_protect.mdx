Backing up a database that is configured with SQL/Protect, and then restoring the backup file to a new database requires additional considerations to what is normally associated with backup and restore procedures. This is primarily due to the use of Object Identification numbers (OIDs) in the SQL/Protect tables as explained in this section.

!!! Note
    This section is applicable if your backup and restore procedures result in the re-creation of database objects in the new database with new OIDs such as is the case when using the `pg_dump` backup program.

If you are backing up your Advanced Server database server by simply using the operating system’s copy utility to create a binary image of the Advanced Server data files (file system backup method), then this section does not apply.

## Object Identification Numbers in SQL/Protect Tables

SQL/Protect uses two tables (`edb_sql_protect` and `edb_sql_protect_rel`) to store information on database objects such as databases, roles, and relations. References to these database objects in these tables are done using the objects’ OIDs, and not the objects’ text names. The OID is a numeric data type used by Advanced Server to uniquely identify each database object.

When a database object is created, Advanced Server assigns an OID to the object, which is then used whenever a reference is needed to the object in the database catalogs. If you create the same database object in two databases, such as a table with the same `CREATE TABLE` statement, each table is assigned a different OID in each database.

In a backup and restore operation that results in the re-creation of the backed up database objects, the restored objects end up with different OIDs in the new database than what they were assigned in the original database. As a result, the OIDs referencing databases, roles, and relations stored in the `edb_sql_protect` and `edb_sql_protect_rel` tables are no longer valid when these tables are simply dumped to a backup file and then restored to a new database.

The following sections describe two functions, `export_sqlprotect` and `import_sqlprotect`, that are used specifically for backing up and restoring SQL/Protect tables in order to ensure the OIDs in the SQL/Protect tables reference the correct database objects after the tables are restored.

## Backing Up the Database

The following steps back up a database that has been configured with SQL/Protect.

**Step 1:** Create a backup file using `pg_dump`.

The following example shows a plain-text backup file named `/tmp/edb.dmp` created from database `edb` using the `pg_dump` utility program:

```text
$ cd /usr/edb/as12/bin
$ ./pg_dump -U enterprisedb -Fp -f /tmp/edb.dmp edb
Password:
$
```

**Step 2:** Connect to the database as a superuser and export the SQL/Protect data using the `export_sqlprotect('sqlprotect_file')` function (where `sqlprotect_file` is the fully qualified path to a file where the `SQL/Protect` data is to be saved).

The `enterprisedb` operating system account (`postgres` if you installed Advanced Server in PostgreSQL compatibility mode) must have read and write access to the directory specified in `sqlprotect_file`.

```text
edb=# SELECT sqlprotect.export_sqlprotect('/tmp/sqlprotect.dmp');
 export_sqlprotect
-------------------
(1 row)
```

The files `/tmp/edb.dmp` and `/tmp/sqlprotect.dmp` comprise your total database backup.

## Restoring From the Backup Files

**Step 1:** Restore the backup file to the new database.

The following example uses the `psql` utility program to restore the plain-text backup file `/tmp/edb.dmp` to a newly created database named `newdb`:

```text
$ /usr/edb/as12/bin/psql -d newdb -U enterprisedb -f /tmp/edb.dmp
Password for user enterprisedb:
SET
SET
SET
SET
SET
COMMENT
CREATE SCHEMA
    .
    .
    .
```

**Step 2:** Connect to the new database as a superuser and delete all rows from the `edb_sql_protect_rel` table.

This step removes any existing rows in the `edb_sql_protect_rel` table that were backed up from the original database. These rows do not contain the correct OIDs relative to the database where the backup file has been restored:

```text
$ /usr/edb/as12/bin/psql -d newdb -U enterprisedb
Password for user enterprisedb:
psql.bin (12.0.0, server 12.0.0)
Type "help" for help.

newdb=# DELETE FROM sqlprotect.edb_sql_protect_rel;
DELETE 2
```

**Step 3:** Delete all rows from the `edb_sql_protect` table.

This step removes any existing rows in the `edb_sql_protect` table that were backed up from the original database. These rows do not contain the correct OIDs relative to the database where the backup file has been restored:

```text
newdb=# DELETE FROM sqlprotect.edb_sql_protect;
DELETE 1
```

**Step 4:** Delete any statistics that may exist for the database.

This step removes any existing statistics that may exist for the database to which you are restoring the backup. The following query displays any existing statistics:

```text
newdb=# SELECT * FROM sqlprotect.edb_sql_protect_stats;
 username  | superusers | relations | commands | tautology | dml
-----------+------------+-----------+----------+-----------+-----
(0 rows)
```

For each row that appears in the preceding query, use the `drop_stats` function specifying the role name of the entry.

For example, if a row appeared with `appuser` in the `username` column, issue the following command to remove it:

```text
newdb=# SELECT sqlprotect.drop_stats('appuser');
 drop_stats
------------
(1 row)
```

**Step 5:** Delete any offending queries that may exist for the database.

This step removes any existing queries that may exist for the database to which you are restoring the backup. The following query displays any existing queries:

```text
edb=# SELECT * FROM sqlprotect.edb_sql_protect_queries;
 username  | ip_address | port | machine_name | date_time | query
-----------+------------+------+--------------+-----------+-------
(0 rows)
```

For each row that appears in the preceding query, use the `drop_queries` function specifying the role name of the entry.

For example, if a row appeared with `appuser` in the `username` column, issue the following command to remove it:

```text
edb=# SELECT sqlprotect.drop_queries('appuser');
 drop_queries
--------------
(1 row)
```

**Step 6:** Make sure the role names that were protected by SQL/Protect in the original database exist in the database server where the new database resides.

If the original and new databases reside in the same database server, then nothing needs to be done assuming you have not deleted any of these roles from the database server.

**Step 7:** Run the function `import_sqlprotect('sqlprotect_file')` where `sqlprotect_file` is the fully qualified path to the file you created in `Step 2` of `Backing Up the Database`.

```text
newdb=# SELECT sqlprotect.import_sqlprotect('/tmp/sqlprotect.dmp');
 import_sqlprotect
-------------------
(1 row)
```

Tables `edb_sql_protect` and `edb_sql_protect_rel` are now populated with entries containing the OIDs of the database objects as assigned in the new database. The statistics view `edb_sql_protect_stats` also now displays the statistics imported from the original database.

The SQL/Protect tables and statistics are now properly restored for this database. This is verified by the following queries on the Advanced Server system catalogs:

```text
newdb=# SELECT datname, oid FROM pg_database;
  datname  |  oid
-----------+-------
 template1 |     1
 template0 | 13909
 edb       | 13917
 newdb     | 16679
(4 rows)

newdb=# SELECT rolname, oid FROM pg_roles;
   rolname    |  oid

newdb=# SELECT relname, oid FROM pg_class WHERE relname IN
('dept','emp','appuser_tab');
   relname   |  oid

 appuser_tab | 16803
 dept        | 16809
 emp         | 16812
(3 rows)

```

Note the following about the columns in tables `edb_sql_protect` and `edb_sql_protect_rel`:

-   **dbid.** Matches the value in the `oid` column from `pg_database` for `newdb`
-   **roleid.** Matches the value in the `oid` column from `pg_roles` for `appuser`

Also note that in table `edb_sql_protect_rel`, the values in the `relid` column match the values in the `oid` column of `pg_class` for relations `dept` and `appuser_tab`.

**Step 8:** Verify that the SQL/Protect configuration parameters are set as desired in the `postgresql.conf` file for the database server running the new database. Restart the database server or reload the configuration file as appropriate.

You can now monitor the database using SQL/Protect.
