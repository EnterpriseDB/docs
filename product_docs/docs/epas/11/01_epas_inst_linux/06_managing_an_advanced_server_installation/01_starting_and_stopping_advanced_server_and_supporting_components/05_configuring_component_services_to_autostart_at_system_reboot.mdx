After installing, configuring, and starting the services of Advanced Server supporting components on a Linux system, you must manually configure your system to autostart the service when your system reboots. To configure a service to autostart on a Linux system, open a command line, assume superuser privileges, and enter the following command.

On a Redhat-compatible Linux system, enter:

â€‹			`/sbin/chkconfig` *`service_name`* `on`

Where *`service_name`* specifies the name of the service.
