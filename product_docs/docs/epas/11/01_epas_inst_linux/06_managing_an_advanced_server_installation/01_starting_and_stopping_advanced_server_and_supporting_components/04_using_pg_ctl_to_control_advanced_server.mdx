<div id="using_pg_ctl_to_control_advanced_server" class="registered_link"></div>

You can use the `pg_ctl` utility to control an Advanced Server service from the command line on any platform. `pg_ctl` allows you to start, stop, or restart the Advanced Server database server, reload the configuration parameters, or display the status of a running server. To invoke the utility, assume the identity of the cluster owner, navigate into the home directory of Advanced Server, and issue the command:

​			`./bin/pg_ctl -D` *`data_directory action`*

*`data_directory`*

​			*`data_directory`* is the location of the data controlled by the Advanced Server cluster.

*`action`*

​			*`action`* specifies the action taken by the `pg_ctl` utility. Specify:

-   `start` to start the service.
-   `stop` to stop the service.
-   `restart` to stop and then start the service.
-   `reload` sends the server a `SIGHUP` signal, reloading configuration parameters
-   `status` to discover the current status of the service.

For more information about using the `pg_ctl` utility, or the command line options available, please see the official PostgreSQL Core Documentation available at:

**Choosing Between pg_ctl and the service Command**

You can use the `pg_ctl` utility to manage the status of an Advanced Server cluster, but it is important to note that `pg_ctl` does not alert the operating system service controller to changes in the status of a server, so it is beneficial to use the `service` command whenever possible.
