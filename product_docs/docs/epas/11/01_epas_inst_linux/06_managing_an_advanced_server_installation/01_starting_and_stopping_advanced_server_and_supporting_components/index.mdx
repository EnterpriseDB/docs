A service is a program that runs in the background and requires no user interaction (in fact, a service provides no user interface); a service can be configured to start at boot time, or manually on demand. Services are best controlled using the platform-specific operating system service control utility. Many of the Advanced Server supporting components are services.

The following table lists the names of the services that control Advanced Server and services that control Advanced Server supporting components:

| Advanced Server Component Name | Linux Service Name         | Debian Service Name          |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Advanced Server                | `edb-as-11`                | `edb-as11-main`              |
| pgAgent                        | `edb-pgagent-11`           | `edb-as11-pgagent`           |
| PgBouncer                      | `edb-pgbouncer-19`         | `edb-pgbouncer19`            |
| pgPool-II                      | `edb-pgpool-37`            | `edb-pgpool37`               |
| Slony                          | `edb-slony-replication-11` | `edb-as11-slony-replication` |
| EFM                            | `efm-3.2`                  | `efm-3.2`                    |

You can use the Linux command line to control Advanced Server's database server and the services of Advanced Server's supporting components. The commands that control the Advanced Server service on a Linux platform are host specific.
