On version 6.x of RHEL or CentOS Linux, you can control a service at the command line with the `service` command. The `service` command can be used to manage an Advanced Server cluster, as well as the services of component software installed with Advanced Server.

Using the `service` command to change the status of a service allows the Linux service controller to keep track of the server status (the `pg_ctl` command does not alert the service controller to changes in the status of a server). The command must be in your search path and must be invoked with superuser privileges. Open a command line, and issue the command:

​			`service` *`service_name action`*

The Linux `service` command invokes a script (with the same name as the service) that resides in `/etc/init.d`. If your Linux distribution does not support the `service` command, you can call the script directly by entering:

​			`/etc/init.d/`*`service_name action`*

Where:

*`service_name`*

​			*`service_name`* specifies the name of the service.

*`action`*

​			*`action`* specifies the action taken by the service command. Specify:

-   `start` to start the service.
-   `stop` to stop the service.
-   `condstop` to stop the service without displaying a notice if the server is already stopped.
-   `restart` to stop and then start the service.
-   `condrestart` to restart the service without displaying a notice if the server is already stopped.
-   `try-restart` to restart the service without displaying a notice if the server is already stopped.
-   `status` to discover the current status of the service.
