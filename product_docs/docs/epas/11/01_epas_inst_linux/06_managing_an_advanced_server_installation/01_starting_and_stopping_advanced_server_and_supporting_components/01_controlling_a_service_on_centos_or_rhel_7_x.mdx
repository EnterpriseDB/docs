If your installation of Advanced Server resides on version 7.x of RHEL and CentOS, you must use the `systemctl` command to control the Advanced Server service and supporting components.

The `systemctl` command must be in your search path and must be invoked with superuser privileges. To use the command, open a command line, and enter:

​			`systemctl` *`action service_name`*

Where:

*`action`*

​			*`action`* specifies the action taken by the service command. Specify:

- start to start the service.
- stop to stop the service.
- restart to stop and then start the service.
- status to discover the current status of the service.

*`service_name`*

​			*`service_name`* specifies the name of the service.
