Appropriate authentication methods provide protection and security. Entries in the `pg_hba.conf` file specify the authentication method or methods that the server will use when authenticating connecting clients. Before connecting to the server, you may be required to modify the authentication properties specified in the `pg_hba.conf` file.

When you invoke the `initdb` utility to create a cluster, `initdb` creates a `pg_hba.conf` file for that cluster that specifies the type of authentication required from connecting clients.

The default authentication configuration specified in the `pg_hba.conf` file is:

To modify the `pg_hba.conf` file, open the file with your choice of editor. After modifying the authentication settings in the `pg_hba.conf` file, use the Linux command line to restart the server and apply the changes.

For more information about authentication, and modifying the `pg_hba.conf` file, see the PostgreSQL Core Documentation at:
