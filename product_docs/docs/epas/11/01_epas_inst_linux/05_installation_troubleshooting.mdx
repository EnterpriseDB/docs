**_Difficulty Displaying Java-based Applications_**

If you encounter difficulty displaying Java-based server features (controls or text not being displayed correctly, or blank windows), upgrading to the latest `libxcb-xlib` libraries should correct the problem on most distributions. Please visit the following link for other possible work-arounds:

**_The Installation Fails to Complete Due to Existing data Directory Contents_**

If an installation fails to complete due to existing content in the data directory, the server will write an error message to the server logs:

`A data directory is neither empty, or a recognisable data directory.`

If you encounter a similar message, you should confirm that the data directory is empty; the presence of files (including the system-generated `lost+found` folder) will prevent the installation from completing. Either remove the files from the data directory, or specify a different location for the data directory before re-invoking the installer to complete the installation.
