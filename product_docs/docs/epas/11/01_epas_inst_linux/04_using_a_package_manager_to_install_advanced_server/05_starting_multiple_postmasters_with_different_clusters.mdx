title:"Starting Multiple Postmasters with Different Clusters"

<div id="starting_multiple_postmasters_with_different_clusters" class="registered_link"></div>

You can configure Advanced Server to use multiple postmasters, each with its own database cluster. The steps required are version specific to the Linux host.

***On RHEL or CentOS 6.x***

The `edb-as11-server-core` RPM contains a script that starts the Advanced Server instance. The script can be copied, allowing you to run multiple services, with unique `data` directories and that monitor different ports. You must have `root` access to invoke or modify the script.

The example that follows creates a second instance on an Advanced Server host; the secondary instance is named `secondary`:

1.  ​	Create a hard link in `/etc/rc.d/init.d` (or equivalent location) to the `edb-as-11` service (named `secondary-edb-as-11`):

​			`ln edb-as-11 secondary-edb-as-11`

Be sure to pick a name that is not already used in `/etc/rc.d/init.d`.

2.  Create a file in `/etc/sysconfig/edb/as11/` named `secondary-edb-as-11`. This file is where you would typically define `PGDATA` and `PGOPTS`. Since `$PGDATA/postgresql.conf` will override many of these settings (except `PGDATA`) you might notice unexpected results on startup.

3.  Create the target `PGDATA` directory.

4.  Assume the identity of the Advanced Server database superuser (`enterprisedb`) and invoke `initdb` on the target PGDATA. For information about using `initdb`, please see the PostgreSQL Core Documentation available at:
    <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/app-initdb.html>

5.  Edit the `postgresql.conf` file to specify the port, address, TCP/IP settings, etc. for the `secondary` instance.

6.  Start the postmaster with the following command:

​			`service secondary-edb-as-11 start`

***On RHEL or CentOS 7.x***

The `edb-as11-server-core` RPM for version 7.x contains a unit file that starts the Advanced Server instance. The file allows you to start multiple services, with unique `data` directories and that monitor different ports. You must have `root` access to invoke or modify the script.

The example that follows creates an Advanced Server installation with two instances; the secondary instance is named `secondary`:

1.  Make a copy of the default file with the new name. As noted at the top of the file, all modifications must reside under `/etc.` You must pick a name that is not already used in `/etc/systemd/system.`

    ​			`cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-11.service /etc/systemd/system/secondary-edb-as-11.service`

2.  Edit the file, changing `PGDATA` to point to the new data directory that you will create the cluster against.

3.  Create the target PGDATA with user `enterprisedb`.

4.  Run `initdb`, specifying the setup script:

    ​			`/usr/edb/as11/bin/edb-as-11-setup initdb secondary-edb-as-11`

5.  Edit the `postgresql.conf` file for the new instance, specifying the port, the IP address, TCP/IP settings, etc.

6.  Make sure that new cluster runs after a reboot:

    ​			`systemctl enable secondary-edb-as-11`

7.  Start the second cluster with the following command:

    ​			`systemctl start secondary-edb-as-11`
