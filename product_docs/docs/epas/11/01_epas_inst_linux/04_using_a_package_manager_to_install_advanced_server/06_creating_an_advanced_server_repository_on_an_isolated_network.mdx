You can create a local repository to act as a host for the Advanced Server RPM packages if the server on which you wish to install Advanced Server (or supporting components) cannot directly access the EnterpriseDB repository. Please note that this is a high-level listing of the steps requires; you will need to modify the process for your individual network.

To create and use a local repository, you must:

1.  Use yum to install the `epel-release,` `yum-utils`, and `createrepo` packages:
    `yum install epel-release`
    `yum install yum-utils`
    `yum install createrepo`

2.  Create a directory in which to store the repository:

    ​ `mkdir /srv/repos`

3.  Copy the RPM installation packages to your local repository. You can download the individual packages or use a tarball to populate the repository.

4.  Sync the RPM packages and create the repository.

    ​ `reposync -r edbas11 -p /srv/repos`
    ​ `createrepo /srv/repos`

5.  Install your preferred webserver on the host that will act as your local repository, and ensure that the repository directory is accessible to the other servers on your network.

6.  On each isolated database server, configure yum to pull updates from the mirrored repository on your local network. For example, you might create a repository configuration file called `/etc/yum.repos.d/edb-repo` with connection information that specifies:

    ​ `[edbas11]`
    ​ `name=EnterpriseDB Advanced Server 11`
    ​ `baseurl=https://yum.*your*_*domain*.com/edbas11`
    ​ `enabled=1`
    ​ `gpgcheck=0`

After specifying the location and connection information for your local repository, you can use yum commands to install Advanced Server and its supporting components on the isolated servers. For example:

​ `yum install edb-as11-server`
