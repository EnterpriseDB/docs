title:"Modifying the Data Directory Location on CentOS or Redhat 7.x"
```

<div id="modifying_the_data_directory_location_on_centos_or_redhat_7_x" class="registered_link"></div>

On a CentOS or RedHat version 7.x host, the unit file is named `edb-as-11.service` and resides in `/usr/lib/systemd/system`. The unit file contains references to the location of the Advanced Server `data` directory. You should avoid making any modifications directly to the unit file because it may be overwritten during package upgrades.

By default, data files reside under `/var/lib/edb/as11/data` directory. To use a data directory that resides in a non-default location, create a copy of the unit file under the `/etc` directory:

`cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-11.service`
   `/etc/systemd/system/`

After copying the unit file to the new location, modify the service file (`/etc/systemd/system/edb-as-11.service`) with your editor of choice, correcting any required paths.

Then, use the following command to reload `systemd`, updating the modified service scripts:

​			`systemctl daemon-reload`

Then, start the Advanced Server service with the following command:

​			`systemctl start edb-as-11`
