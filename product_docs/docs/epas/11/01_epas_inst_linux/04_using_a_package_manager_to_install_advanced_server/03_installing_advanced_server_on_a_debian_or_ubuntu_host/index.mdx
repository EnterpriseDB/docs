To install Advanced Server on a Debian or Ubuntu host, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, visit:

​ <https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request>

The following steps will walk you through using the EnterpriseDB apt repository to install a debian package. When using the commands, replace the `username` and `password` with the credentials provided by EnterpriseDB.

1.  Assume superuser privileges:
    `sudo su –`
2.  Configure the EnterpriseDB repository:
    `sh -c 'echo "deb https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'`
3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:
    `apt-get install apt-transport-https`
4.  Add the EBD signing key:
    `wget -q -O - https://username:password @apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add -`
5.  Update the repository metadata:
    `apt-get update`
6.  Install Debian package:
    `apt-get install edb-as11`

Note: The OpenJDK version 10 is supported on a Debian or Ubuntu host of Java components. Before using a debian package to add Advanced Server or a supporting component such as MTK or EDB\*Plus that requires Java, make sure to install Java version 8 on your system to support EDB Java-based components.
