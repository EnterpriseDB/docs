You can use an RPM package to install Advanced Server and supporting components on a Linux host. Before installing Advanced Server, you must:

**Install the EPEL Release Package**

You can use yum to install the epel-release package:

​ `yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm`

Please note that you may need to enable the `[extras]` repository definition in the `CentOS-Base.repo` file located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

If yum cannot access a repository that contains epel-release, you will get an error message:

​ `No package epel available.`
​ `Error: Nothing to do`

If you receive this error, you can download the `EPEL` rpm package, and install it manually. To manually install `EPEL`, download the rpm package, assume superuser privileges, navigate into the directory that contains the package, and install `EPEL` with the command:

​ `yum install epel-release`

You must also have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf

After receiving your repository credentials you can:

1. Create the repository configuration file.
2. Modify the file, providing your user name and password.
3. Install Advanced Server.

**Linux-specific Software Requirements**

You must install `xterm, konsole,` or `gnome-terminal` before executing any console-based program installed by EnterpriseDB installers.

`Migration Toolkit or EDB Plus Installation Prerequisites`
Before using an RPM to install Migration Toolkit or EDB Plus, you must first install Java version 1.7 or later for Migration Toolkit and Java version 1.8 or later for EDB Plus. On a Linux system, you can use the yum package manager to install Java. Open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

​ `yum install java`

Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation.
