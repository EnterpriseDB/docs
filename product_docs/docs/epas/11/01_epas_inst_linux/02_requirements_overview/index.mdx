## Linux Installation Prerequisites

You can use an RPM package to install Advanced Server and supporting components on a Linux host. Before installing Advanced Server, you must:

**Install the EPEL Release Package**

You can use yum to install the epel-release package:

​ `yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm`

Please note that you may need to enable the `[extras]` repository definition in the `CentOS-Base.repo` file (located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`).

If yum cannot access a repository that contains epel-release, you will get an error message:

​ `No package epel available.`
​ `Error: Nothing to do`

If you receive this error, you can download the `EPEL` rpm package, and install it manually. To manually install `EPEL`, download the rpm package, assume superuser privileges, navigate into the directory that contains the package, and install `EPEL` with the command:

​ `yum install epel-release`

You must also have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

After receiving your repository credentials you can:

1.  Create the repository configuration file.
2.  Modify the file, providing your user name and password.
3.  Install Advanced Server.

**Linux-specific Software Requirements**

You must install `xterm, konsole,` or `gnome-terminal` before executing any console-based program installed by EnterpriseDB installers.

`Migration Toolkit or EDB Plus Installation Prerequisites`
Before using an RPM to install Migration Toolkit or EDB\*Plus, you must first install Java version 1.7 or later for Migration Toolkit and Java version 1.8 or later for EDB\*Plus. On a Linux system, you can use the yum package manager to install Java. Open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

​ # `yum install java`

Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation.
