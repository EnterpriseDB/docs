You can use variations of the rpm or yum command to remove installed packages. Note that removing a package does not damage the Advanced Server `data` directory.

Include the `-e` option when invoking the rpm command to remove an installed package; the command syntax is:

​			`rpm -e package_name` 

Where *`package_name`* is the name of the package that you would like to remove.

You can use the `yum remove` command to remove a package installed by yum. To remove a package, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter the command:

​			`yum remove package_name`

Where *`package_name`* is the name of the package that you would like to remove.

Note: yum and RPM will not remove a package that is required by another package. If you attempt to remove a package that satisfies a package dependency, yum or RPM will provide a warning.

To uninstall Advanced Server and its dependent packages; use the following command:

​			`yum remove edb-as11-server*`
