This section describes configuration parameters affecting statement behavior.

## default_heap_fillfactor



**Parameter Type:** Integer

**Default Value:** 100

**Range:** 10 to 100

**Minimum Scope of Effect:** Per session

**When Value Changes Take Effect:** Immediate

**Required Authorization to Activate:** Session user

Sets the fillfactor for a table when the `FILLFACTOR` storage parameter is omitted from a `CREATE TABLE` command.

The fillfactor for a table is a percentage between 10 and 100. 100 (complete packing) is the default. When a smaller `fillfactor` is specified, `INSERT` operations pack table pages only to the indicated percentage; the remaining space on each page is reserved for updating rows on that page. This gives `UPDATE` a chance to place the updated copy of a row on the same page as the original, which is more efficient than placing it on a different page. For a table whose entries are never updated, complete packing is the best choice, but in heavily updated tables smaller fillfactors are appropriate.

## edb_data_redaction



**Parameter Type:** Boolean

**Default Value:** true

**Range:** {true | false}

**Minimum Scope of Effect:** Per session

**When Value Changes Take Effect:** Immediate

**Required Authorization to Activate:** Session user

Data redaction is the support of policies to limit the exposure of certain sensitive data to certain users by altering the displayed information.

The default setting is `TRUE` so the data redaction is applied to all users except for superusers and the table owner:

  - Superusers and table owner bypass data redaction.
  - All other users get the redaction policy applied and see the reformatted data.

If the parameter is disabled by setting it to `FALSE`, then the following occurs:

  - Superusers and table owner still bypass data redaction.
  - All other users will get an error.

For information on data redaction, see the section "Data Redaction".
