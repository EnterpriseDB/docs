Bulk processing logs the resulting statements into both the Advanced Server log file and the EDB Audit log file. However, logging each and every statement in bulk processing is costly. This can be controlled by the edb_log_every_bulk_value configuration parameter. When set to true, each and every statement in bulk processing is logged. When set to false, a log message is recorded once per bulk processing. In addition, the duration is emitted once per bulk processing. Default is set to false.
