This section provides an overview of how configuration parameters are specified and set.

Each configuration parameter is set using a `name/value` pair. Parameter names are case-insensitive. The parameter name is typically separated from its value by an optional equals sign (=).

The following is an example of some configuration parameter settings in the `postgresql.conf` file:

```TEXT

<div id="setting_new_parameters" class="registered_link"></div>

log_connections = yes
log_destination = 'syslog'
search_path = '"$user", public'
shared_buffers = 128MB
```

Parameter values are specified as one of five types:

-   **Boolean.** Acceptable values can be written as on, off, true, false, yes, no, 1, 0, or any unambiguous prefix of these.
-   **Integer.** Number without a fractional part.
-   **Floating Point.** Number with an optional fractional part separated by a decimal point.
-   **String.** Text value. Enclose in single quotes if the value is not a simple identifier or number (that is, the value contains special characters such as spaces or other punctuation marks).
-   **Enum.** Specific set of string values. The allowed values can be found in the system view `pg_settings.enumvals`. Enum values are case-insensitive.

Some settings specify a memory or time value. Each of these has an implicit unit, which is kilobytes, blocks (typically 8 kilobytes), milliseconds, seconds, or minutes. Default units can be found by referencing the system view `pg_settings.unit`. A different unit can be specified explicitly.

Valid memory units are kB (kilobytes), MB (megabytes), and GB (gigabytes). Valid time units are ms (milliseconds), s (seconds), min (minutes), h (hours), and d (days). The multiplier for memory units is 1024.

The configuration parameter settings can be established in a number of different ways:

-   There is a number of parameter settings that are established when the Advanced Server database product is built. These are read-only parameters, and their values cannot be changed. There are also a couple of parameters that are permanently set for each database when the database is created. These parameters are read-only as well and cannot be subsequently changed for the database.

-   The initial settings for almost all configurable parameters across the entire database cluster are listed in the configuration file, `postgresql.conf`. These settings are put into effect upon database server start or restart. Some of these initial parameter settings can be overridden as discussed in the following bullet points. All configuration parameters have built-in default settings that are in effect if not explicitly overridden.

-   Configuration parameters in the `postgresql.conf` file are overridden when the same parameters are included in the `postgresql.auto.conf` file. The `ALTER SYSTEM` command is used to manage the configuration parameters in the `postgresql.auto.conf` file.

-   Parameter settings can be modified in the configuration file while the database server is running. If the configuration file is then reloaded (meaning a SIGHUP signal is issued), for certain parameter types, the changed parameters settings immediately take effect. For some of these parameter types, the new settings are available in a currently running session immediately after the reload. For other of these parameter types, a new session must be started to use the new settings. And yet for other parameter types, modified settings do not take effect until the database server is stopped and restarted. See the following section of the PostgreSQL Core Documentation for information on how to reload the configuration file:

    > <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/config-setting.html>

-   The SQL commands `ALTER DATABASE`, `ALTER ROLE`, or `ALTER ROLE IN DATABASE` can be used to modify certain parameter settings. The modified parameter settings take effect for new sessions after the command is executed. `ALTER DATABASE` affects new sessions connecting to the specified database. `ALTER ROLE` affects new sessions started by the specified role. `ALTER ROLE IN DATABASE` affects new sessions started by the specified role connecting to the specified database. Parameter settings established by these SQL commands remain in effect indefinitely, across database server restarts, overriding settings established by the methods discussed in the second and third bullet points. Parameter settings established using the `ALTER DATABASE`, `ALTER ROLE`, or `ALTER ROLE IN DATABASE` commands can only be changed by: a) re-issuing these commands with a different parameter value, or

    b) issuing these commands using either of the [SET ]\(#parameter> TO DEFAULT`clause or the`RESET &lt;parameter) clause. These clauses change the parameter back to using the setting established by the methods set forth in the prior bullet points. See the “SQL Commands” section of Chapter VI “Reference” in the *PostgreSQL Core Documentation* for the exact syntax of these SQL commands:

    > <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-commands.html>

-   Changes can be made for certain parameter settings for the duration of individual sessions using the `PGOPTIONS` environment variable or by using the `SET` command within the `EDB-PSQL` or `PSQL` command line terminal programs. Parameter settings made in this manner override settings established using any of the methods described by the second, third, and fourth bullet points, but only for the duration of the session.
