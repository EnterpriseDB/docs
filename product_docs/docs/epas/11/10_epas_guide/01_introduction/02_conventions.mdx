<div id="conventions" class="registered_link"></div>




The following is a list of conventions used throughout this document.

  - This guide applies to both Linux and Windows systems. Directory paths are presented in the Linux format with forward slashes. When working on Windows systems, start the directory path with the drive letter followed by a colon and substitute back slashes for forward slashes.
  - Some of the information in this document may apply interchangeably to the PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server database systems. The term *Advanced Server* is used to refer to EDB Postgres Advanced Server. The term *Postgres* is used to generically refer to both PostgreSQL and Advanced Server. When a distinction needs to be made between these two database systems, the specific names, PostgreSQL or Advanced Server are used.
  - The installation directory path of the PostgreSQL or Advanced Server products is referred to as *POSTGRES_INSTALL_HOME*.
      - For PostgreSQL Linux installations, this defaults to `/opt/PostgreSQL/<x.x>` for version 10 and earlier. For later versions, use the PostgreSQL community packages.
      - For Advanced Server Linux installations accomplished using the interactive installer for version 10 and earlier, this defaults to `/opt/edb/as<x.x>`.
      - For Advanced Server Linux installations accomplished using an RPM package, this defaults to `/usr/edb/as<xx>`.
      - For Advanced Server Windows installations, this defaults to `C:\Program Files\edb\as\<xx>`. The product version number is represented by `<x.x>` or by `<xx>` for version 10 and later.
