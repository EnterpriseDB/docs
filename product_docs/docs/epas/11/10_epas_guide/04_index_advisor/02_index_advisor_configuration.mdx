Index Advisor does not require configuration to generate recommendations that are available only for the duration of the current session; to store the results of multiple sessions, you must create the `index_advisor_log` table. To create the `index_advisor_log` table , you must run the `index_advisor.sql` script.

When selecting a storage schema for the Index Advisor table, function and view, keep in mind that all users that invoke Index Advisor (and query the result set) must have `USAGE` privileges on the schema. The schema must be in the search path of all users that are interacting with the Index Advisor.

1.  Place the selected schema at the start of your search_path parameter. For example, if your search path is currently:
    
    `search_path=public, accounting`
    
    and you want the Index Advisor objects to be created in a schema named advisor, use the command:
    
    `SET search_path = advisor, public, accounting;`

2.  Run the `index_advisor.sql` script to create the database objects. If you are running the psql client, you can use the command:
    
    i \<full_pathname\>/index_advisor.sql
    
    Specify the pathname to the `index_advisor.sql` script in place of *full_pathname*.

3.  Grant privileges on the `index_advisor_log` table to all Index Advisor users; this step is not necessary if the Index Advisor user is a superuser, or the owner of these database objects.

<!-- end list -->

  - Grant `SELECT` and `INSERT` privileges on the `index_advisor_log` table to allow a user to invoke Index Advisor.
  - Grant `DELETE` privileges on the `index_advisor_log` table to allow the specified user to delete the table contents.
  - Grant `SELECT` privilege on the `index_recommendations` view.

The following example demonstrates the creation of the Index Advisor database objects in a schema named `ia`, which will then be accessible to an Index Advisor user with user name *ia_user*:

``` text
$ edb-psql -d edb -U enterprisedb
psql.bin (12.0.0, server 12.0.0)
Type "help" for help.

 edb=# CREATE SCHEMA ia;
 CREATE SCHEMA
 edb=# SET search_path TO ia;
 SET
 edb=# \i /usr/edb/as12/share/contrib/index_advisor.sql
 CREATE TABLE
 CREATE INDEX
 CREATE INDEX
 CREATE FUNCTION
 CREATE FUNCTION
 CREATE VIEW
 edb=# GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA ia TO ia_user;
 GRANT
 edb=# GRANT SELECT, INSERT, DELETE ON index_advisor_log TO ia_user;
 GRANT
 edb=# GRANT SELECT ON index_recommendations TO ia_user;
 GRANT
```

While using Index Advisor, the specified schema (`ia`) must be included in *ia_user*'s `search_path` parameter.
