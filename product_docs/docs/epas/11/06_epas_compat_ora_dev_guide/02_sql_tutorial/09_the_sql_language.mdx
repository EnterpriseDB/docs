Advanced Server supports SQL language that is compatible with Oracle syntax as well as syntax and commands for extended functionality (functionality that does not provide database compatibility for Oracle or support Oracle-styled applications).

The *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's SQL Reference Guide* provides detailed information about:

  - Compatible SQL syntax and language elements
  - Data types
  - Supported SQL command syntax
