In Oracle, when a string is concatenated with a null variable or null column, the result is the original string; however, in PostgreSQL concatenation of a string with a null variable or null column gives a null result. If the `edb_redwood_strings` parameter is set to `TRUE`, the aforementioned concatenation operation results in the original string as done by Oracle. If `edb_redwood_strings` is set to `FALSE`, the native PostgreSQL behavior is maintained.

The following example illustrates the difference.

The sample application introduced in the next section contains a table of employees. This table has a column named `comm` that is null for most employees. The following query is run with `edb_redwood_string` set to `FALSE`. The concatenation of a null column with non-empty strings produces a final result of null, so only employees that have a commission appear in the query result. The output line for all other employees is null.

```text
SET edb_redwood_strings TO off;

SELECT RPAD(ename,10) || ' ' || TO_CHAR(sal,'99,999.99') || ' ' ||
TO_CHAR(comm,'99,999.99') "EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION" FROM emp;

    EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION
----------------------------------

 ALLEN        1,600.00     300.00
 WARD         1,250.00     500.00

 MARTIN       1,250.00   1,400.00




 TURNER       1,500.00        .00




(14 rows)
```

The following is the same query executed when `edb_redwood_strings` is set to `TRUE`. Here, the value of a null column is treated as an empty string. The concatenation of an empty string with a non-empty string produces the non-empty string. This result is consistent with the results produced by Oracle for the same query.

```text
SET edb_redwood_strings TO on;

SELECT RPAD(ename,10) || ' ' || TO_CHAR(sal,'99,999.99') || ' ' ||
TO_CHAR(comm,'99,999.99') "EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION" FROM emp;
