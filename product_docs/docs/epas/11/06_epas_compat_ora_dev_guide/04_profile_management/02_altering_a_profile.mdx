title: 'Altering a Profile'

<div id="altering_a_profile" class="registered_link"></div>

Use the `ALTER PROFILE` command to modify a user-defined profile; Advanced Server supports two forms of the command:

```text
ALTER PROFILE <profile_name> RENAME TO <new_name>;

ALTER PROFILE <profile_name>
      LIMIT {<parameter value>}[...];
```

Include the `LIMIT` clause and one or more space-delimited `parameter/value` pairs to specify the rules enforced by Advanced Server, or use `ALTER PROFILE...RENAME TO` to change the name of a profile.

**Parameters:**

> `profile_name` specifies the name of the profile.
>
> `new_name` specifies the new name of the profile.
>
> `parameter` specifies the attribute limited by the profile.
>
> `value` specifies the parameter limit.

See the table in [Creating a New Profile ](../04_profile_management/01_creating_a_new_profile/#creating_a_new_profile), for a complete list of accepted parameter/value pairs.

**Examples**

The following example modifies a profile named `acctg_profile`:

```text
ALTER PROFILE acctg_profile
       LIMIT FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS 3 PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME 1;
```

`acctg_profile` will count failed connection attempts when a login role attempts to connect to the server. The profile specifies that if a user has not authenticated with the correct password in three attempts, the account will be locked for one day.

The following example changes the name of `acctg_profile` to `payables_profile`:

```text
ALTER PROFILE acctg_profile RENAME TO payables_profile;
```
