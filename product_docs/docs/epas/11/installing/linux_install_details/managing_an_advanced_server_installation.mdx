Unless otherwise noted, the commands and paths noted in the following section assume that you have performed an installation using the native packages.

## Starting and Stopping Advanced Server and Supporting Components

A service is a program that runs in the background and requires no user interaction (in fact, a service provides no user interface); a service can be configured to start at boot time, or manually on demand. Services are best controlled using the platform-specific operating system service control utility. Many of the Advanced Server supporting components are services.

The following table lists the names of the services that control Advanced Server and services that control Advanced Server supporting components:

| Advanced Server Component Name | Linux Service Name       | Debian Service Name        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Advanced Server                | edb-as-11                | edb-as@11-main             |
| pgAgent                        | edb-pgagent-11           | edb-as11-pgagent           |
| PgBouncer                      | edb-pgbouncer-1.14       | edb-pgbouncer114           |
| pgPool-II                      | edb-pgpool-4.1           | edb-pgpool41               |
| Slony                          | edb-slony-replication-11 | edb-as11-slony-replication |
| EFM                            | edb-efm-4.0              | edb-efm-4.0                |

You can use the Linux command line to control Advanced Server's database server and the services of Advanced Server's supporting components. The commands that control the Advanced Server service on a Linux platform are host specific.

### Controlling a Service on RHEL/CentOS 7.x or RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8.x

If your installation of Advanced Server resides on RHEL/CentOS 7.x or RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8.x, you must use the `systemctl` command to control the Advanced Server service and supporting components.

The `systemctl` command must be in your search path and must be invoked with superuser privileges. To use the command, open a command line, and enter:

```text
systemctl <action> <service_name>
```

Where:

`service_name` specifies the name of the service.

`action` specifies the action taken by the service command. Specify:

-   `start` to start the service.
-   `stop` to stop the service.
-   `restart` to stop and then start the service.
-   `status` to discover the current status of the service.

### Controlling a Service on Ubuntu 18.04 

By default, a server is running with the peer or md5 permission on a Debian or Ubuntu host. You can change the `auth_type` from `pg_hba.conf` file available under:

  `vi /etc/edb-as/11/main/pg_hba.conf`

Please note, all the server configuration files are available under `/etc/edb-as/11/main`. 

If your installation of Advanced Server resides on version 18.04 of Ubuntu, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following commands (using bundled scripts) to manage the service. Use the following commands to:

-   Discover the current status of a service:

    ```text
    /usr/bin/epas_ctlcluster 11 main status
    ```

-   Stop a service:

    ```text
    /usr/bin/epas_ctlcluster 11 main stop
    ```

-   Restart a service:

    ```text
    /usr/bin/epas_ctlcluster 11 main restart
    ```

-   Reload a service:

    ```text
    /usr/bin/epas_ctlcluster 11 main reload
    ```

-   Control the component services:

    ```text
    systemctl restart edb-as@11-main
    ```

### Using pg_ctl to Control Advanced Server

You can use the `pg_ctl` utility to control an Advanced Server service from the command line on any platform. `pg_ctl` allows you to start, stop, or restart the Advanced Server database server, reload the configuration parameters, or display the status of a running server. To invoke the utility, assume the identity of the cluster owner, navigate into the home directory of Advanced Server, and issue the command:

```text
./bin/pg_ctl -D <data_directory> <action>
```

`data_directory` is the location of the data controlled by the Advanced Server cluster.

`action` specifies the action taken by the `pg_ctl` utility. Specify:

-   `start` to start the service.
-   `stop` to stop the service.
-   `restart` to stop and then start the service.
-   `reload` sends the server a `SIGHUP` signal, reloading configuration parameters
-   `status` to discover the current status of the service.

For more information about using the `pg_ctl` utility, or the command line options available, see the official PostgreSQL Core Documentation available at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/app-pg-ctl.html>

**Choosing Between pg_ctl and the service Command**

You can use the `pg_ctl` utility to manage the status of an Advanced Server cluster, but it is important to note that `pg_ctl` does not alert the operating system service controller to changes in the status of a server, so it is beneficial to use the `service` command whenever possible.

### Configuring Component Services to AutoStart at System Reboot

After installing, configuring, and starting the services of Advanced Server supporting components on a Linux system, you must manually configure your system to autostart the service when your system reboots. To configure a service to autostart on a Linux system, open a command line, assume superuser privileges, and enter the following command.

On a Redhat-compatible Linux system, enter:

```text
/sbin/chkconfig <service_name> on
```

Where `service_name` specifies the name of the service.

## Connecting to Advanced Server with psql

`psql` is a command line client application that allows you to execute SQL commands and view the results. To open the psql client, the client must be in your search path. The executable resides in the `bin` directory, under your Advanced Server installation.

Use the following command and options to start the psql client:

```text
psql -d edb -U enterprisedb
```

Where:

`-d` specifies the database to which psql will connect.

`-U` specifies the identity of the database user that will be used for the session.

For more information about using the command line client, see the PostgreSQL Core Documentation at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/app-psql.html>

## Configuring a Package Installation

The packages that install the database server component create a unit file (on version 7.x or 8.x hosts) and service startup scripts.

### Creating a Database Cluster and Starting the Service

The PostgreSQL `initdb` command creates a database cluster. After installing Advanced Server, you must manually configure the service and invoke `initdb` to create your cluster. When invoking `initdb`, you can:

-   Specify environment options on the command line.
-   Include the `systemd` service manager on RHEL/CentOS 7.x or RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8.x and use a service configuration file to configure the environment.

To review the `initdb` documentation, visit:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/app-initdb.html>

After specifying any options in the service configuration file, you can create the database cluster and start the service; these steps are platform specific.

### On RHEL/CentOS 7.x or RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8.x

To invoke `initdb` on a RHEL/CentOS 7.x or RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8.x system, with the options specified in the service configuration file, assume the identity of the operating system superuser:

```text
su - root
```

To initialize a cluster with the non-default values, you can use the `PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS` environment variable by invoking the `edb-as-11-setup` cluster initialization script that resides under `EPAS_Home/bin`.

To invoke `initdb` export the `PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS` environment variable with the following command:

```text
PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS="-E UTF-8" /usr/edb/as11/bin/edb-as-11-setup initdb
```

After creating the cluster, use `systemctl` to start, stop, or restart the service:

```text
systemctl { start | stop | restart } edb-as-11
```

### On Ubuntu 18.04

You can initialize multiple clusters using the bundled scripts. To create a new cluster, assume `root` privileges, and invoke the bundled script:

```text
/usr/bin/epas_createcluster 11 main2
```

To start a new cluster, use the following command:

```text
/usr/bin/epas_ctlcluster 11 main2 start  
```

To list all the available clusters, use the following command:

```text
/usr/bin/epas_lsclusters
```

!!! Note
    The data directory is created under `/var/lib/edb-as/11/main2` and configuration directory is created under `/etc/edb-as/11/main/`.

<div id="specifying_cluster_options_with_initdbopts" class="registered_link"></div>

## Specifying cluster options with INITDBOPTS

You can use the `INITDBOPTS` variable to specify your cluster configuration preferences. By default, the `INITDBOPTS` variable is commented out in the service configuration file. Unless you modify it, when you run the service startup script, the new cluster is created in a mode compatible with Oracle databases. Clusters created in this mode contain a database named `edb` and have a database superuser named `enterprisedb`.

### Initializing the cluster in Oracle mode

If you initialize the database using Oracle compatibility mode, the installation includes:

-   Data dictionary views compatible with Oracle databases.
-   Oracle data type conversions.
-   Date values displayed in a format compatible with Oracle syntax.
-   Support for Oracle-styled concatenation rules. If you concatenate a string value with a `NULL` value, the returned value is the value of the string.
-   Support for the following Oracle built-in packages.

| Package          | Functionality compatible with Oracle databases                                                                                                                               |

### Initializing the cluster in Postgres mode

Clusters created in PostgreSQL mode don't include compatibility features. To create a new cluster in PostgreSQL mode, remove the pound sign (#) in front of the `INITDBOPTS` variable, enabling the `"--no-redwood-compat"` option. Clusters created in PostgreSQL mode contain a database named `postgres` and have a database superuser named `postgres`.

You can also specify multiple `initdb` options. For example, the following statement creates a database cluster without compatibility features for Oracle. The cluster contains a database named `postgres` that's owned by a user named `alice`. The cluster uses `UTF-8` encoding.

```text
INITDBOPTS="--no-redwood-compat -U alice --locale=en_US.UTF-8"
```

If you initialize the database using `"--no-redwood-compat"` mode, the installation includes the following package:

| Package            | Functionality noncompatible with Oracle databases                                                               |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dbms_aqadm`       | Provides supporting procedures for Advanced Queueing functionality.                                              |
| `dbms_aq`          | Provides message queueing and processing for EDB Postgres Advanced Server.                                                    |
| `edb_bulkload`     | Provides direct/conventional data loading capability when loading huge amount of data into a database.           |
| `edb_gen`          | Provides miscellaneous packages to run built-in packages.                                                        |
| `edb_objects`      | Provides Oracle-compatible objects such as packages and procedures.                                             |
| `waitstates`       | Provides monitor session blocking.                                                                               |
| `edb_dblink_libpq` | Provides link to foreign databases via libpq.                                                                    |
| `edb_dblink_oci`   | Provides link to foreign databases via OCI.                                                                      |
| `snap_tables`      | Creates tables to hold wait information. Included with DRITA scripts.                                            |
| `snap_functions`   | Creates functions to return a list of snap ids and the time the snapshot was taken. Included with DRITA scripts. |
| `sys_stats`        | Provides OS performance statistics.                                                                              |

In addition to the cluster configuration options documented in the PostgreSQL core documentation, EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports the following `initdb` options:

`--no-redwood-compat`

Include the `--no-redwood-compat` keywords to create the cluster in PostgreSQL mode. When the cluster is created in PostgreSQL mode, the name of the database superuser is `postgres`, and the name of the default database is `postgres`. The few EDB Postgres Advanced Server features compatible with Oracle databases are available with this mode. However, we recommend using the EDB Postgres Advanced Server in redwood compatibility mode to use all its features.

`--redwood-like`

Include the `--redwood-like` keywords to use an escape character, that is, an empty string (''), following the `LIKE` (or PostgreSQL-compatible `ILIKE`) operator in a SQL statement that's compatible with Oracle syntax.

`--icu-short-form`

Include the `--icu-short-form` keywords to create a cluster that uses a default International Components for Unicode (ICU) collation for all databases in the cluster. For more information about Unicode collations, see [Unicode collation algorithm](../../epas_guide/03_database_administration/06_unicode_collation_algorithm/).

For more information about using `initdb` and the available cluster configuration options, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-initdb.html).

You can also view online help for `initdb` by assuming superuser privileges and entering:

```text
/path_to_initdb_installation_directory/initdb --help
```

Where `path_to_initdb_installation_directory` specifies the location of the `initdb` binary file.


### Modifying the Data Directory Location on RHEL/CentOS 7.x or RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8.x

On a RHEL/CentOS 7.x or RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8.x host, the unit file is named `edb-as-11.service` and resides in `/usr/lib/systemd/system`. The unit file contains references to the location of the Advanced Server `data` directory. You should avoid making any modifications directly to the unit file because it may be overwritten during package upgrades.

By default, data files reside under `/var/lib/edb/as11/data` directory. To use a data directory that resides in a non-default location, perform the following steps:

-   Create a copy of the unit file under the `/etc` directory:

    ```text
    cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-11.service /etc/systemd/system/
    ```

-   After copying the unit file to the new location, modify the service file `/etc/systemd/system/edb-as-11.service` with your editor of choice, correcting any required paths.

-   Use the following command to reload `systemd`, updating the modified service scripts:

    ```text
    systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

-   Start the Advanced Server service with the following command:

    ```text
    systemctl start edb-as-11
    ```

## Starting Multiple Postmasters with Different Clusters

You can configure Advanced Server to use multiple postmasters, each with its own database cluster. The steps required are version specific to the Linux host.

### On RHEL/CentOS 7.x or RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8.x

The `edb-as11-server-core` RPM for version 7.x | 8.x contains a unit file that starts the Advanced Server instance. The file allows you to start multiple services, with unique `data` directories and that monitor different ports. You must have `root` access to invoke or modify the script.

The example that follows creates an Advanced Server installation with two instances; the secondary instance is named `secondary`:

-   Make a copy of the default file with the new name. As noted at the top of the file, all modifications must reside under `/etc`. You must pick a name that is not already used in `/etc/systemd/system`.

    ```text
    cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-11.service /etc/systemd/system/secondary-edb-as-11.service
    ```

-   Edit the file, changing `PGDATA` to point to the new `data` directory that you will create the cluster against.

-   Create the target `PGDATA` with user `enterprisedb`.

-   Run `initdb`, specifying the setup script:

    ```text
    /usr/edb/as11/bin/edb-as-11-setup initdb secondary-edb-as-11
    ```

-   Edit the `postgresql.conf` file for the new instance, specifying the port, the IP address, TCP/IP settings, etc.

-   Make sure that new cluster runs after a reboot:

    ```text
    systemctl enable secondary-edb-as-11
    ```

-   Start the second cluster with the following command:

    ```text
    systemctl start secondary-edb-as-11
    ```

## Creating an Advanced Server Repository on an Isolated Network

You can create a local repository to act as a host for the Advanced Server RPM packages if the server on which you wish to install Advanced Server (or supporting components) cannot directly access the EnterpriseDB repository. Please note that this is a high-level listing of the steps requires; you will need to modify the process for your individual network.

To create and use a local repository, you must:

-   Use `yum` or `dnf` to install the `epel-release`, `yum-utils`, and `createrepo` packages.

    On RHEL or CentOS 7.x:

    ```bash
    yum install epel-release
    yum install yum-utils
    yum install createrepo
    ```

    On RHEL or Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8.x:

    ```bash
    dnf install epel-release
    dnf install yum-utils
    dnf install createrepo
    ```

-   Create a directory in which to store the repository:

    ```text
    mkdir /srv/repos
    ```

-   Copy the RPM installation packages to your local repository. You can download the individual packages or use a tarball to populate the repository. The packages are available from the EnterpriseDB repository at <https://repos.enterprisedb.com/>.

-   Sync the RPM packages and create the repository.

    ```text
    reposync -r edbas11 -p /srv/repos
    createrepo /srv/repos
    ```

-   Install your preferred webserver on the host that will act as your local repository, and ensure that the repository directory is accessible to the other servers on your network.

-   On each isolated database server, configure `yum` or `dnf` to pull updates from the mirrored repository on your local network. For example, you might create a repository configuration file called `/etc/yum.repos.d/edb-repo` with connection information that specifies:

    ```text
    [edbas11]
    name=EnterpriseDB Advanced Server 11
    baseurl=https://yum.your_domain.com/edbas11
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0
    ```

After specifying the location and connection information for your local repository, you can use `yum` or `dnf` commands to install Advanced Server and its supporting components on the isolated servers. For example:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as11-server
    ```

-   On RHEL or Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install edb-as11-server
    ```
