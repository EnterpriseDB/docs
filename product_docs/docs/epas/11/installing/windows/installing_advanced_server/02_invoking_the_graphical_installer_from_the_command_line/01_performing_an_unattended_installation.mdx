To specify that the installer should run without user interaction, include the `--mode unattended` command line option. In unattended mode, the installer uses one of the following sources for configuration parameters:

-   command line options (specified when invoking the installer)
-   parameters specified in an option file
-   Advanced Server installation defaults

You can embed the non-interactive Advanced Server installer within another application installer; during the installation process, a progress bar allows the user to view the progression of the installation.

You must have administrative privileges to install Advanced Server using the `--mode unattended` option. If you are using the `--mode unattended` option to install Advanced Server with a client, the calling client must be invoked with superuser or administrative privileges.

To start the installer in unattended mode, navigate to the directory that contains the executable file, and enter:

```text
edb-as11-server-11.x.x-x-windows-x64.exe --mode unattended --superpassword
database_superuser_password --servicepassword system_password
```

When invoking the installer, include the `--servicepassword` option to specify an operating system password for the user installing Advanced Server.

Use the `--superpassword` option to specify a password that conforms to the password security policies defined on the host; enforced password policies on your system may not accept the default password `(enterprisedb)`.
