This section describes the SQL-compliant subquery expressions available in Advanced Server. All of the expression forms documented in this section return Boolean `(TRUE/FALSE)` results.

## EXISTS

The argument of `EXISTS` is an arbitrary `SELECT` statement, or subquery. The subquery is evaluated to determine whether it returns any rows. If it returns at least one row, the result of `EXISTS` is `TRUE`; if the subquery returns no rows, the result of `EXISTS` is `FALSE`.

``` text
EXISTS(subquery)
```

The subquery can refer to variables from the surrounding query, which will act as constants during any one evaluation of the subquery.

The subquery will generally only be executed far enough to determine whether at least one row is returned, not all the way to completion. It is unwise to write a subquery that has any side effects (such as calling sequence functions); whether the side effects occur or not may be difficult to predict.

Since the result depends only on whether any rows are returned, and not on the contents of those rows, the output list of the subquery is normally uninteresting. A common coding convention is to write all `EXISTS` tests in the form `EXISTS(SELECT 1 WHERE ...)`. There are exceptions to this rule however, such as subqueries that use `INTERSECT`.

This simple example is like an inner join on `deptno`, but it produces at most one output row for each `dept` row, even though there are multiple matching `emp` rows:

``` text
SELECT dname FROM dept WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM emp WHERE emp.deptno = dept.deptno);

   dname
------------
 ACCOUNTING
 RESEARCH
 SALES
(3 rows)
```

## IN

The right-hand side is a parenthesized subquery, which must return exactly one column. The left-hand expression is evaluated and compared to each row of the subquery result. The result of `IN` is `TRUE` if any equal subquery row is found. The result is FALSE if no equal row is found (including the special case where the subquery returns no rows).

``` text
expression IN (subquery)
```

Note that if the left-hand expression yields `NULL`, or if there are no equal right-hand values and at least one right-hand row yields `NULL`, the result of the `IN` construct will be `NULL`, not `FALSE`. This is in accordance with SQL’s normal rules for Boolean combinations of null values.

As with `EXISTS`, it’s unwise to assume that the subquery will be evaluated completely.

## NOT IN

The right-hand side is a parenthesized subquery, which must return exactly one column. The left-hand expression is evaluated and compared to each row of the subquery result. The result of `NOT IN` is `TRUE` if only unequal subquery rows are found (including the special case where the subquery returns no rows). The result is `FALSE` if any equal row is found.

``` text
expression NOT IN (subquery)
```

Note that if the left-hand expression yields `NULL`, or if there are no equal right-hand values and at least one right-hand row yields `NULL`, the result of the `NOT IN` construct will be `NULL`, not `TRUE`. This is in accordance with SQL’s normal rules for Boolean combinations of null values.

As with `EXISTS`, it’s unwise to assume that the subquery will be evaluated completely.

## ANY/SOME

The right-hand side is a parenthesized subquery, which must return exactly one column. The left-hand expression is evaluated and compared to each row of the subquery result using the given operator, which must yield a Boolean result. The result of `ANY` is `TRUE` if any true result is obtained. The result is `FALSE` if no true result is found (including the special case where the subquery returns no rows).

``` text
expression operator ANY (subquery)
expression operator SOME (subquery)
```

`SOME` is a synonym for `ANY`. `IN` is equivalent to `= ANY`.

Note that if there are no successes and at least one right-hand row yields `NULL` for the operator’s result, the result of the `ANY` construct will be `NULL`, not `FALSE`. This is in accordance with SQL’s normal rules for Boolean combinations of null values.

As with `EXISTS`, it’s unwise to assume that the subquery will be evaluated completely.

## ALL

The right-hand side is a parenthesized subquery, which must return exactly one column. The left-hand expression is evaluated and compared to each row of the subquery result using the given operator, which must yield a Boolean result. The result of `ALL` is `TRUE` if all rows yield true (including the special case where the subquery returns no rows). The result is `FALSE` if any false result is found. The result is `NULL` if the comparison does not return `FALSE` for any row, and it returns `NULL` for at least one row.

``` text
expression operator ALL (subquery)
```

`NOT IN` is equivalent to `<> ALL`. As with `EXISTS`, it’s unwise to assume that the subquery will be evaluated completely.
