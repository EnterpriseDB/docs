When you create a partitioned table, you specify `LIST, RANGE`, or `HASH` partitioning rules. The partitioning rules provide a set of constraints that define the data that is stored in each partition. As new rows are added to the partitioned table, the server uses the partitioning rules to decide which partition should contain each row.

Advanced Server can also use the partitioning rules to enforce partition pruning, improving performance when responding to user queries. When selecting a partitioning type and partitioning keys for a table, you should take into consideration how the data that is stored within a table will be queried, and include often-queried columns in the partitioning rules.

!!! Note
    Advanced Server does not support the creation of partitioned tables when using `default_with_rowids` set to `ON`. 

**List Partitioning**

When you create a list-partitioned table, you specify a single partitioning key column. When adding a row to the table, the server compares the key values specified in the partitioning rule to the corresponding column within the row. If the column value matches a value in the partitioning rule, the row is stored in the partition named in the rule.

**Range Partitioning**

When you create a range-partitioned table, you specify one or more partitioning key columns. When you add a new row to the table, the server compares the value of the partitioning key (or keys) to the corresponding column (or columns) in a table entry. If the column values satisfy the conditions specified in the partitioning rule, the row is stored in the partition named in the rule.

**Hash Partitioning**

When you create a hash-partitioned table, you specify one or more partitioning key columns. Data is divided into (approx.) equal-sized partitions amongst the specified partitions. When you add a row to a hash-partitioned table, the server computes a hash value for the data in the specified column (or columns), and stores the row in a partition according to the hash value.

!!! Note
    When upgrading Advanced Server, you must rebuild each hash-partitioned table on the upgraded version server.

**Subpartitioning**

Subpartitioning breaks a partitioned table into smaller subsets. All subsets must be stored in the same database server cluster. A table is typically subpartitioned by a different set of columns, and may be a different subpartitioning type than the parent partition. If one partition is subpartitioned, then each partition will have at least one subpartition.

If a table is subpartitioned, no data will be stored in any of the partition tables; the data will be stored instead in the corresponding subpartitions.
