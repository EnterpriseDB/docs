title: "DROP TABLE"

<div id="drop_table" class="registered_link"></div>

Use the PostgreSQL `DROP TABLE` command to remove a partitioned table definition, it's partitions and subpartitions, and delete the table contents. The syntax is:

```text
DROP TABLE <table_name>
```

**Parameters**

`table_name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the partitioned table.

**Description**

The `DROP TABLE` command removes an entire table, and the data that resides in that table. When you delete a table, any partitions or subpartitions (of that table) are deleted as well.

To use the `DROP TABLE` command, you must be the owner of the partitioning root, a member of a group that owns the table, the schema owner, or a database superuser.

**Example**

To delete a table, connect to the controller node (the host of the partitioning root), and invoke the `DROP TABLE` command. For example, to delete the `sales` table, invoke the following command:

```text
DROP TABLE sales;
```

The server will confirm that the table has been dropped.

```text
edb=# drop table sales;
DROP TABLE
edb=#
```

For more information about the `DROP TABLE` command, see the PostgreSQL core documentation at:
