EnterpriseDB has enhanced ECPG (the PostgreSQL pre-compiler) to create ECPGPlus. ECPGPlus allows you to include embedded SQL commands in C applications; when you use ECPGPlus to compile an application that contains embedded SQL commands, the SQL code is syntax-checked and translated into C.

ECPGPlus supports Pro\*C compatible syntax in C programs when connected to an Advanced Server database. ECPGPlus supports:

-   Oracle Dynamic SQL – Method 4 (ODS-M4).
-   Pro\*C compatible anonymous blocks.
-   A `CALL` statement compatible with Oracle databases.

As part of ECPGPlus' Pro\*C compatibility, you do not need to include the `BEGIN DECLARE SECTION` and `END DECLARE SECTION` directives.

For more information about using ECPGPlus, see the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server ECPG Connector Guide* available from the EnterpriseDB website at:
