<div id="edb_redwood_date" class="registered_link"></div>

When `DATE` appears as the data type of a column in the commands, it is translated to `TIMESTAMP` at the time the table definition is stored in the data base if the configuration parameter `edb_redwood_date` is set to `TRUE`. Thus, a time component will also be stored in the column along with the date. This is consistent with Oracle’s `DATE` data type.

If `edb_redwood_date` is set to `FALSE` the column’s data type in a `CREATE TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE` command remains as a native PostgreSQL `DATE` data type and is stored as such in the database. The PostgreSQL `DATE` data type stores only the date without a time component in the column.

Regardless of the setting of `edb_redwood_date`, when `DATE` appears as a data type in any other context such as the data type of a variable in an SPL declaration section, or the data type of a formal parameter in an SPL procedure or SPL function, or the return type of an SPL function, it is always internally translated to a `TIMESTAMP` and thus, can handle a time component if present.

See the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Reference Guide* for more information about date/time data types.
