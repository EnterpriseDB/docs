By default, Advanced Server will add new data into the first available free-space in a table (vacated by vacuumed records). Include the `APPEND` directive after an `INSERT` or `SELECT` command to instruct the server to bypass mid-table free space, and affix new rows to the end of the table. This optimizer hint can be particularly useful when bulk loading data.

The syntax is:

```text
/*+APPEND*/
```

For example, the following command, compatible with Oracle databases, instructs the server to append the data in the `INSERT` statement to the end of the `sales` table:

```text
INSERT /*+APPEND*/ INTO sales VALUES
(10, 10, '01-Mar-2011', 10, 'OR');
```

Note that Advanced Server supports the `APPEND` hint when adding multiple rows in a single `INSERT` statement:

```text
INSERT /*+APPEND*/ INTO sales VALUES
(20, 20, '01-Aug-2011', 20, 'NY'),
(30, 30, '01-Feb-2011', 30, 'FL'),
(40, 40, '01-Nov-2011', 40, 'TX');
```

The `APPEND` hint can also be included in the `SELECT` clause of an `INSERT INTO` statement:

```text
INSERT INTO sales_history SELECT /*+APPEND*/ FROM sales;
```
