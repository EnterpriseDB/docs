The following hints influence how the optimizer accesses relations to create the result set.

| Hint                              | Description                                           |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `FULL(table)`                     | Perform a full sequential scan on `table`.            |
| `INDEX(table [ index ] [...])`    | Use `index` on `table` to access the relation.        |
| `NO_INDEX(table [ index ] [...])` | Do not use `index` on `table` to access the relation. |

In addition, the `ALL_ROWS, FIRST_ROWS`, and `FIRST_ROWS(n)` hints can be used.

**Examples**

The sample application does not have sufficient data to illustrate the effects of optimizer hints so the remainder of the examples in this section will use a banking database created by the `pgbench` application located in the Advanced Server `bin` subdirectory.

The following steps create a database named, `bank`, populated by the tables, `pgbench_accounts, pgbench_branches, pgbench_tellers`, and `pgbench_history`. The `–s 20` option specifies a scaling factor of twenty, which results in the creation of twenty branches, each with 100,000 accounts, resulting in a total of 2,000,000 rows in the `pgbench_accounts` table and twenty rows in the `pgbench_branches` table. Ten tellers are assigned to each branch resulting in a total of 200 rows in the `pgbench_tellers` table.

The following initializes the `pgbench` application in the `bank` database.

```text
createdb -U enterprisedb bank
CREATE DATABASE

pgbench -i -s 20 -U enterprisedb bank

A total of 500,00 transactions are then processed. This will populate the `pgbench_history` table with 500,000 rows.

The table definitions are shown below:

```

The `EXPLAIN` command shows the plan selected by the query planner. In the following example, `aid` is the primary key column, so an indexed search is used on index, `pgbench_accounts_pkey`.

```text
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM pgbench_accounts WHERE aid = 100;

                                       QUERY PLAN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------
Index Scan using pgbench_accounts_pkey on pgbench_accounts  (cost=0.43..8.45
rows=1 width=97)
   Index Cond: (aid = 100)
(2 rows)
```

The `FULL` hint is used to force a full sequential scan instead of using the index as shown below:

```text
EXPLAIN SELECT /*+ FULL(pgbench_accounts) */ * FROM pgbench_accounts WHERE
aid = 100;

                          QUERY PLAN
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Seq Scan on pgbench_accounts  (cost=0.00..58781.69 rows=1 width=97)
  Filter: (aid = 100)
(2 rows)
```

The `NO_INDEX` hint forces a parallel sequential scan instead of use of the index as shown below:

```text
EXPLAIN SELECT /*+ NO_INDEX(pgbench_accounts pgbench_accounts_pkey) */ *
FROM pgbench_accounts WHERE aid = 100;

                                  QUERY PLAN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------
 Gather  (cost=1000.00..45094.80 rows=1 width=97)
   Workers Planned: 2
   ->  Parallel Seq Scan on pgbench_accounts  (cost=0.00..44094.70 rows=1
   width=97)
           Filter: (aid = 100)
(4 rows)
```

In addition to using the `EXPLAIN` command as shown in the prior examples, more detailed information regarding whether or not a hint was used by the planner can be obtained by setting the `trace_hints` configuration parameter as follows:

```text
SET trace_hints TO on;
```

The `SELECT` command with the `NO_INDEX` hint is repeated below to illustrate the additional information produced when the `trace_hints` configuration parameters is set.

```text
EXPLAIN SELECT /*+ NO_INDEX(pgbench_accounts pgbench_accounts_pkey) */ *
FROM pgbench_accounts WHERE aid = 100;

INFO:  [HINTS] Index Scan of [pgbench_accounts].[pgbench_accounts_pkey]
rejected due to NO_INDEX hint.
                                  QUERY PLAN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Gather  (cost=1000.00..45094.80 rows=1 width=97)
   Workers Planned: 2

width=97)
         Filter: (aid = 100)
(4 rows)
```

Note that if a hint is ignored, the `INFO: [HINTS]` line will not appear. This may be an indication that there was a syntax error or some other misspelling in the hint as shown in the following example where the index name is misspelled.

```text
EXPLAIN SELECT /*+ NO_INDEX(pgbench_accounts pgbench_accounts_xxx) */ * FROM
pgbench_accounts WHERE aid = 100;

                                       QUERY PLAN
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
