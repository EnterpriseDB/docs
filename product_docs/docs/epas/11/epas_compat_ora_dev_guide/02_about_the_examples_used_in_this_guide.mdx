The examples shown in this guide are illustrated using the PSQL program. The prompt that normally appears when using PSQL is omitted in these examples to provide extra clarity for the point being demonstrated.

```text
Examples and output from examples are shown in fixed-width, white font on a dark background.
```

Also note the following points:

-   During installation of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server the selection for configuration and defaults compatible with Oracle databases must be chosen in order to reproduce the same results as the examples shown in this guide. A default compatible configuration can be verified by issuing the following commands in PSQL and obtaining the same results as shown below.

    ```text
    SHOW edb_redwood_date;

     edb_redwood_date
    ------------------
     on

    SHOW datestyle;

     DateStyle
    --------------
     Redwood, DMY

    SHOW edb_redwood_strings;

     edb_redwood_strings
    ---------------------
     on
    ```

-   The examples use the sample tables, `dept`, `emp`, and `jobhist`, created and loaded when Advanced Server is installed. The `emp` table is installed with triggers that must be disabled in order to reproduce the same results as shown in this guide. Log onto Advanced Server as the `enterprisedb` superuser and disable the triggers by issuing the following command.

    ```text
    ALTER TABLE emp DISABLE TRIGGER USER;
    ```

    The triggers on the `emp` table can later be re-activated with the following command.

    ```text
    ALTER TABLE emp ENABLE TRIGGER USER;
    ```
