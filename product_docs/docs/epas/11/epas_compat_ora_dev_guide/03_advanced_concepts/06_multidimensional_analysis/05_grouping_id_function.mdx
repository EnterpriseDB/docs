<div id="grouping_id_function" class="registered_link"></div>

The `GROUPING_ID` function provides a simplification of the `GROUPING` function in order to determine the subtotal level of a row in the result set from a `ROLLBACK, CUBE`, or `GROUPING SETS` extension.

The `GROUPING` function takes only one column expression and returns an indication of whether or not a row is a subtotal over all values of the given column. Thus, multiple `GROUPING` functions may be required to interpret the level of subtotals for queries with multiple grouping columns.

The `GROUPING_ID` function accepts one or more column expressions that have been used in the `ROLLBACK, CUBE`, or `GROUPING SETS` extensions and returns a single integer that can be used to determine over which of these columns a subtotal has been aggregated.

The general syntax for use of the `GROUPING_ID` function is shown by the following.

```text
SELECT [ <expr> ...,]
  GROUPING_ID( <col_expr_1> [, <col_expr_2> ] ... )
  [, <expr> ] ...
FROM ...
GROUP BY [...,]
  { ROLLUP | CUBE | GROUPING SETS }( [...,] <col_expr_1>
  [, <col_expr_2> ] [, ...] ) [, ...]
```

The `GROUPING_ID` function takes one or more parameters that must be expressions of dimension columns specified in the expression list of a `ROLLUP, CUBE`, or `GROUPING SETS` extension of the `GROUP BY` clause.

The `GROUPING_ID` function returns an integer value. This value corresponds to the base-10 interpretation of a bit vector consisting of the concatenated 1’s and 0’s that would be returned by a series of `GROUPING` functions specified in the same left-to-right order as the ordering of the parameters specified in the `GROUPING_ID` function.

The following query shows how the returned values of the `GROUPING_ID` function represented in column `gid` correspond to the values returned by two `GROUPING` functions on columns `loc` and `dname`.

```text
SELECT loc, dname, COUNT(*) AS "employees",
  GROUPING(loc) AS "gf_loc", GROUPING(dname) AS "gf_dname",
  GROUPING_ID(loc, dname) AS "gid"
FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY CUBE (loc, dname)
ORDER BY 6, 1, 2;
```

In the following output, note the relationship between a bit vector consisting of the `gf_loc` value and `gf_dname` value compared to the integer given in `gid`.

```text
loc      |   dname    | employees | gf_loc | gf_dname | gid
---------+------------+-----------+--------+----------+-----
BOSTON   | OPERATIONS |         3 |      0 |        0 |   0
BOSTON   | RESEARCH   |         5 |      0 |        0 |   0
CHICAGO  | SALES      |         6 |      0 |        0 |   0
NEW YORK | ACCOUNTING |         3 |      0 |        0 |   0
BOSTON   |            |         8 |      0 |        1 |   1
CHICAGO  |            |         6 |      0 |        1 |   1
NEW YORK |            |         3 |      0 |        1 |   1
         | ACCOUNTING |         3 |      1 |        0 |   2
         | OPERATIONS |         3 |      1 |        0 |   2
         | RESEARCH   |         5 |      1 |        0 |   2
         | SALES      |         6 |      1 |        0 |   2
         |            |        17 |      1 |        1 |   3
(12 rows)
```

The following table provides specific examples of the `GROUPING_ID` function calculations based on the `GROUPING` function return values for four rows of the output.

| loc      | dname        | Bit Vector<br /><br />gf_loc gf_dname | GROUPING_ID<br /><br /> gid |
| -------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `BOSTON` | `OPERATIONS` | 0 \* 2¹ + 0 \* 2⁰                     | `0`                         |
| `BOSTON` | `null`       | 0 \* 2¹ + 1 \* 2⁰                     | `1`                         |
| `null`   | `ACCOUNTING` | 1 \* 2¹ + 0 \* 2⁰                     | `2`                         |
| `null`   | `null`       | 1 \* 2¹ + 1 \* 2⁰                     | `3`                         |

The following table summarizes how the `GROUPING_ID` function return values correspond to the grouping columns over which aggregation occurs.

| Aggregation by Column | Bit Vector<br /><br />gf_loc gf_dname | GROUPING_ID<br /><br /> gid |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `loc, dname`          | `0`   `0`                             | `0`                         |
| `loc`                 | `0`   `1`                             | `1`                         |
| `dname`               | `1`   `0`                             | `2`                         |
| `Grand Total`         | `1`   `1`                             | `3`                         |

So to display only those subtotals by `dname`, the following simplified query can be used with a `HAVING` clause based on the `GROUPING_ID` function.

```text
SELECT loc, dname, COUNT(*) AS "employees",
  GROUPING(loc) AS "gf_loc", GROUPING(dname) AS "gf_dname",
  GROUPING_ID(loc, dname) AS "gid"
FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY CUBE (loc, dname)
HAVING GROUPING_ID(loc, dname) = 2
ORDER BY 6, 1, 2;
```

The following is the result of the query.

```text
loc |   dname    | employees | gf_loc | gf_dname | gid
----+------------+-----------+--------+----------+-----
    | ACCOUNTING |         3 |      1 |        0 |   2
    | OPERATIONS |         3 |      1 |        0 |   2
    | RESEARCH   |         5 |      1 |        0 |   2
    | SALES      |         6 |      1 |        0 |   2
(4 rows)
```
