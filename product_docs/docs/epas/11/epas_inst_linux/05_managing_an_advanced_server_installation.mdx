Unless otherwise noted, the commands and paths noted in the following section assume that you have performed an installation using the native packages.

## Starting and Stopping Advanced Server and Supporting Components

A service is a program that runs in the background and requires no user interaction (in fact, a service provides no user interface); a service can be configured to start at boot time, or manually on demand. Services are best controlled using the platform-specific operating system service control utility. Many of the Advanced Server supporting components are services.

The following table lists the names of the services that control Advanced Server and services that control Advanced Server supporting components:

| Advanced Server Component Name | Linux Service Name       | Debian Service Name        |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| Advanced Server                | edb-as-11                | edb-as@11-main             |
| pgAgent                        | edb-pgagent-11           | edb-as11-pgagent           |
| PgBouncer                      | edb-pgbouncer-1.14       | edb-pgbouncer114           |
| pgPool-II                      | edb-pgpool-4.1           | edb-pgpool41               |
| Slony                          | edb-slony-replication-11 | edb-as11-slony-replication |
| EFM                            | edb-efm-4.0              | edb-efm-4.0                |

You can use the Linux command line to control Advanced Server's database server and the services of Advanced Server's supporting components. The commands that control the Advanced Server service on a Linux platform are host specific.

### Controlling a Service on CentOS or RHEL 7.x | 8.x

If your installation of Advanced Server resides on version 7.x | 8.x of RHEL and CentOS, you must use the `systemctl` command to control the Advanced Server service and supporting components.

The `systemctl` command must be in your search path and must be invoked with superuser privileges. To use the command, open a command line, and enter:

```text
systemctl <action> <service_name>
```

Where:

`service_name` specifies the name of the service.

`action` specifies the action taken by the service command. Specify:

-   `start` to start the service.
-   `stop` to stop the service.
-   `restart` to stop and then start the service.
-   `status` to discover the current status of the service.

### Controlling a Service on Debian 9.x or Ubuntu 18.04 

By default, a server is running with the peer or md5 permission on a Debian or Ubuntu host. You can change the `auth_type` from `pg_hba.conf` file available under:

  `vi /etc/edb-as/11/main/pg_hba.conf`

Please note, all the server configuration files are available under `/etc/edb-as/11/main`. 

If your installation of Advanced Server resides on version 9.x of Debian or 18.04 of Ubuntu, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following commands (using bundled scripts) to manage the service. Use the following commands to:

-   Discover the current status of a service:

    ```text
    /usr/bin/epas_ctlcluster 11 main status
    ```

-   Stop a service:

    ```text
    /usr/bin/epas_ctlcluster 11 main stop
    ```

-   Restart a service:

    ```text
    /usr/bin/epas_ctlcluster 11 main restart
    ```

-   Reload a service:

    ```text
    /usr/bin/epas_ctlcluster 11 main reload
    ```

-   Control the component services:

    ```text
    systemctl restart edb-as@11-main
    ```

### Using pg_ctl to Control Advanced Server

You can use the `pg_ctl` utility to control an Advanced Server service from the command line on any platform. `pg_ctl` allows you to start, stop, or restart the Advanced Server database server, reload the configuration parameters, or display the status of a running server. To invoke the utility, assume the identity of the cluster owner, navigate into the home directory of Advanced Server, and issue the command:

```text
./bin/pg_ctl -D <data_directory> <action>
```

`data_directory` is the location of the data controlled by the Advanced Server cluster.

`action` specifies the action taken by the `pg_ctl` utility. Specify:

-   `start` to start the service.
-   `stop` to stop the service.
-   `restart` to stop and then start the service.
-   `reload` sends the server a `SIGHUP` signal, reloading configuration parameters
-   `status` to discover the current status of the service.

For more information about using the `pg_ctl` utility, or the command line options available, see the official PostgreSQL Core Documentation available at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/app-pg-ctl.html>

**Choosing Between pg_ctl and the service Command**

You can use the `pg_ctl` utility to manage the status of an Advanced Server cluster, but it is important to note that `pg_ctl` does not alert the operating system service controller to changes in the status of a server, so it is beneficial to use the `service` command whenever possible.

### Configuring Component Services to AutoStart at System Reboot

After installing, configuring, and starting the services of Advanced Server supporting components on a Linux system, you must manually configure your system to autostart the service when your system reboots. To configure a service to autostart on a Linux system, open a command line, assume superuser privileges, and enter the following command.

On a Redhat-compatible Linux system, enter:

```text
/sbin/chkconfig <service_name> on
```

Where `service_name` specifies the name of the service.

## Connecting to Advanced Server with psql

`psql` is a command line client application that allows you to execute SQL commands and view the results. To open the psql client, the client must be in your search path. The executable resides in the `bin` directory, under your Advanced Server installation.

Use the following command and options to start the psql client:

```text
psql -d edb -U enterprisedb
```

Where:

`-d` specifies the database to which psql will connect.

`-U` specifies the identity of the database user that will be used for the session.

For more information about using the command line client, see the PostgreSQL Core Documentation at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/app-psql.html>
