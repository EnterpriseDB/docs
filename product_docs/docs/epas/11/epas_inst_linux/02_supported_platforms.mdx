For information about the platforms and versions supported by Advanced Server, visit the EnterpriseDB website at:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/product-compatibility>

!!! Note
    Advanced Server is no longer supported on RHEL/CentOS/OEL 6.x platforms. It is strongly recommended that EDB products running on these platforms be migrated to a supported platform. 

Limitations**

The following limitations apply to EDB Postgres Advanced Server:

-   The `data` directory of a production database should not be stored on an NFS file system.
-   The LLVM JIT package is supported on RHEL 7.x, 8.x, and SLES. LLVM JIT is not supported on PPC-LE 64 (running RHEL or CentOS 7.x).
