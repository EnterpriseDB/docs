title: "DROP_SCHEDULE"
---



Use the `DROP_SCHEDULE` procedure to drop a schedule. The signature is:

> `DROP_SCHEDULE(`  
> `<schedule_name IN VARCHAR2`,  
> `<force> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE)`

**Parameters**

`<schedule_name>`

> `<schedule_name>` specifies the name of the schedule that is being dropped.

`<force>`

> `<force>` specifies the behavior of the server if the specified schedule is referenced by any job:
> 
>   - Specify `FALSE` to instruct the server to return an error if the specified schedule is referenced by a job. This is the default behavior.
>   - Specify `TRUE` to instruct the server to disable to any jobs that use the specified schedule before dropping the schedule. Any running jobs will be allowed to complete before the schedule is dropped.

**Example**

The following call to `DROP_SCHEDULE` drops a schedule named `weeknights_at_5`:

``` text
DBMS_SCHEDULER.DROP_SCHEDULE('weeknights_at_5', TRUE);
```

The server will disable any jobs that use the schedule before dropping the schedule.
