title: "CREATE_SCHEDULE"
---



Use the `CREATE_SCHEDULE` procedure to create a job schedule. The signature of the `CREATE_SCHEDULE` procedure is:

> `create_schedule(`  
> `<schedule_name> IN VARCHAR2`,  
> `<start_date> IN TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NULL`,  
> `<repeat_interval> IN VARCHAR2`,  
> `<end_date> IN TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NULL`,  
> `<comments> IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL)`

**Parameters**

`<schedule_name>`

> `<schedule_name>` specifies the name of the schedule.

`<start_date>`

> `<start_date>` is a `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` value that specifies the date and time that the schedule is eligible to execute. If a `<start_date>` is not specified, the date that the job is enabled is used as the `<start_date>`. By default, `<start_date>` is `NULL`.

`<repeat_interval>`

> `<repeat_interval>` is a `VARCHAR2` value that specifies how often the job will repeat. If a `<repeat_interval>` is not specified, the job will execute only once, on the date specified by `<start_date>`.
> 
> <div class="note">
> 
> <div class="title">
> 
> Note
> 
> </div>
> 
> You must provide a value for either `<start_date>` or `<repeat_interval>`; if both `<start_date>` and `<repeat_interval>` are `NULL`, the server will return an error.
> 
> </div>

`<end_date> IN TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NULL`

> `<end_date>` is a `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` value that specifies a time after which the schedule will no longer execute. If a date is specified, the `<end_date>` must be after the `<start_date>`. The default value is `NULL`.
> 
> Please note that if a `<repeat_interval>` is specified and an `<end_date>` is not specified, the schedule will repeat indefinitely until it is disabled.

`<comments> IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL)`

> Use the `<comments>` parameter to specify a comment about the schedule; by default, this parameter is `NULL`.

**Example**

The following code fragment calls `CREATE_SCHEDULE` to create a schedule named weeknights_at_5:

``` text
EXEC
  DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_SCHEDULE (
    schedule_name    => 'weeknights_at_5',
    start_date       => '01-JUN-13 09:00:00.000000'
    repeat_interval  => 'FREQ=DAILY;BYDAY=MON,TUE,WED,THU,FRI;BYHOUR=17;',
    comments         => 'This schedule executes each weeknight at 5:00');
```

The schedule executes each weeknight, at 5:00 pm, effective after June 1, 2013. Since no `end_date` is specified, the schedule will execute indefinitely until it is disabled with `DBMS_SCHEDULER.DISABLE`.
