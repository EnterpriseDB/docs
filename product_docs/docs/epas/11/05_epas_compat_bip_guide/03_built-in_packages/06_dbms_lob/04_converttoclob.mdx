title: "CONVERTTOCLOB"
---



The `CONVERTTOCLOB` procedure provides the capability to convert binary data to character.

> `CONVERTTOCLOB(<dest_lob> IN OUT CLOB, <src_blob> BLOB`,
> 
> > `<amount> INTEGER, <dest_offset> IN OUT INTEGER`,
> > 
> > `<src_offset> IN OUT INTEGER, <blob_csid> NUMBER`,
> > 
> > `<lang_context> IN OUT INTEGER, <warning> OUT INTEGER)`

**Parameters**

`<dest_lob>`

> `CLOB` large object locator to which the binary data is to be converted.

`<src_blob>`

> `BLOB` large object locator of the binary data to be converted.

`<amount>`

> Number of bytes of `<src_blob>` to be converted.

`<dest_offset> IN`

> Position in characters in the destination `CLOB` where writing of the source `BLOB` should begin. The first character is offset 1.

`<dest_offset> OUT`

> Position in characters in the destination `CLOB` after the write operation completes. The first character is offset 1.

`<src_offset> IN`

> Position in bytes in the source `BLOB` where conversion to the destination `CLOB` should begin. The first byte is offset 1.

`<src_offset> OUT`

> Position in bytes in the source `BLOB` after the conversion operation completes. The first byte is offset 1.

`<blob_csid>`

> Character set ID of the converted, destination `CLOB`.

`<lang_context> IN`

> Language context for the conversion. The default value of 0 is typically used for this setting.

`<lang_context> OUT`

> Language context after the conversion completes.

`<warning>`

> 0 if the conversion was successful, 1 if an inconvertible character was encountered.
