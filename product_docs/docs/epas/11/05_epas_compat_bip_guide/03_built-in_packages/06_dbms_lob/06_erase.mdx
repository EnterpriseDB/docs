title: "ERASE"
---



The `ERASE` procedure provides the capability to erase a portion of a large object. To erase a large object means to replace the specified portion with zero-byte fillers for `BLOBs` or with spaces for `CLOBs`. The actual size of the large object is not altered.

> `ERASE( <lob_loc> IN OUT { BLOB | CLOB }, <amount> IN OUT INTEGER`
> 
> > `[, <offset> INTEGER ])`

**Parameters**

`<lob_loc>`

> Large object locator of the large object to be erased.

`<amount> IN`

> Number of bytes/characters to be erased.

`<amount> OUT`

> Number of bytes/characters actually erased. This value can be smaller than the input value if the end of the large object is reached before `<amount>` bytes/characters have been erased.

`<offset>`

> Position in the large object where erasing is to begin. The first byte/character is position 1. The default is 1.
