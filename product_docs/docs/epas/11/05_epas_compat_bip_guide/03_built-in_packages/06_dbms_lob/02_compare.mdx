title: "COMPARE"
---



The `COMPARE` procedure performs an exact byte-by-byte comparison of two large objects for a given length at given offsets. The large objects being compared must be the same data type.

`<status> INTEGER COMPARE(<lob_1> { BLOB | CLOB }`,

> `<lob_2> { BLOB | CLOB }`
> 
> `[, <amount> INTEGER [, <offset_1> INTEGER [, <offset_2> INTEGER ]]])`

**Parameters**

`<lob_1>`

> Large object locator of the first large object to be compared. Must be the same data type as `<lob_2>`.

`<lob_2>`

> Large object locator of the second large object to be compared. Must be the same data type as `<lob_1>`.

`<amount>`

> If the data type of the large objects is `BLOB`, then the comparison is made for `<amount>` bytes. If the data type of the large objects is `CLOB`, then the comparison is made for `<amount>` characters. The default is the maximum size of a large object.

`<offset_1>`

> Position within the first large object to begin the comparison. The first byte/character is offset 1. The default is 1.

`<offset_2>`

> Position within the second large object to begin the comparison. The first byte/character is offset 1. The default is 1.

`<status>`

> Zero if both large objects are exactly the same for the specified length for the specified offsets. Non-zero, if the objects are not the same. `<NULL>` if `<amount>`, `<offset_1>`, or `<offset_2>` are less than zero.
