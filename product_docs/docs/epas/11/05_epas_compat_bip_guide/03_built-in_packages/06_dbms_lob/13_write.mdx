title: "WRITE"
---



The `WRITE` procedure provides the capability to write data into a large object. Any existing data in the large object at the specified offset for the given length is overwritten by data given in the buffer.

> `WRITE(<lob_loc> IN OUT { BLOB | CLOB }`,
> 
> > `<amount> BINARY_INTEGER`,
> > 
> > `<offset> INTEGER, <buffer> { RAW | VARCHAR2 })`

**Parameters**

`<lob_loc>`

> Large object locator of the large object to be written.

`<amount>`

> The number of bytes/characters in `<buffer>` to be written to the large object.

`<offset>`

> The offset in bytes/characters from the beginning of the large object (origin is 1) for the write operation to begin.

`<buffer>`

> Contains data to be written to the large object. If `<lob_loc>` is a `BLOB`, then `<buffer>` must be `RAW`. If `<lob_loc>` is a `CLOB`, then `<buffer>` must be `VARCHAR2`.
