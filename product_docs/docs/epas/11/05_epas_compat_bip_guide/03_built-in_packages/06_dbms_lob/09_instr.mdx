---



The `INSTR` function returns the location of the nth occurrence of a given pattern within a large object.

> `<position> INTEGER INSTR(<lob_loc> { BLOB | CLOB }`,
> 
> `<pattern> { RAW | VARCHAR2 } [, <offset> INTEGER [, <nth> INTEGER]])`

**Parameters**

`<lob_loc>`

> Large object locator of the large object in which to search for pattern.

`<pattern>`

> Pattern of bytes or characters to match against the large object, lob. `<pattern>` must be RAW if `<lob_loc>` is a `BLOB`. pattern must be `VARCHAR2` if `<lob_loc>` is a `CLOB`.

`<offset>`

> Position within `<lob_loc>` to start search for `<pattern>`. The first byte/character is position 1. The default is 1.

`<nth>`

> Search for `<pattern>`, `<nth>` number of times starting at the position given by `<offset>`. The default is 1.

`<position>`

> Position within the large object where \<pattern\< appears the nth time specified by \<nth\< starting from the position given by `<offset>`.
