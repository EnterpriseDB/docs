The functions within the `DBMS_PROFILER` package return a status code to indicate success or failure; the `DBMS_PROFILER` procedures raise an exception only if they encounter a failure. The status codes and messages returned by the functions, and the exceptions raised by the procedures are listed in the table below.

| Status Code | Message         | Exception          | Description                                             |

| `-1`        | `error version` | `version_mismatch` | The profiler version and the database are incompatible. |
| `0`         | `success`       | n/a                | The operation completed successfully.                   |
| `1`         | `error_param`   | `profiler_error`   | The operation received an incorrect parameter.          |
| `2`         | `error_io`      | `profiler_error`   | The data flush operation has failed.                    |

## Using DBMS_PROFILER

The `DBMS_PROFILER` package collects and stores performance information about the PL/pgSQL and SPL statements that are executed during a profiling session; you can review the performance information in the tables and views provided by the profiler.

`DBMS_PROFILER` works by recording a set of performance-related counters and timers for each line of PL/pgSQL or SPL statement that executes within a profiling session. The counters and timers are stored in a table named `SYS.PLSQL_PROFILER_DATA`. When you complete a profiling session, `DBMS_PROFILER` will write a row to the performance statistics table for each line of PL/pgSQL or SPL code that executed within the session. For example, if you execute the following function:

`1 - CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION getBalance(acctNumber INTEGER)`

`2 - RETURNS NUMERIC AS $$`

`3 - DECLARE`

`4 - result NUMERIC;`

`5 - BEGIN`

`6 - SELECT INTO result balance FROM acct WHERE id = acctNumber;`

`7 -`

`8 - IF (result IS NULL) THEN`

`9 -     RAISE INFO 'Balance is null';`

`10- END IF;`

`11-`

`12- RETURN result;`

`13- END;`

`14- $$ LANGUAGE 'plpgsql';`

`DBMS_PROFILER` adds one `PLSQL_PROFILER_DATA` entry for each line of code within the `getBalance()` function (including blank lines and comments). The entry corresponding to the `SELECT` statement executed exactly one time; and required a very small amount of time to execute. On the other hand, the entry corresponding to the `RAISE INFO` statement executed once or not at all (depending on the value for the `balance` column).

Some of the lines in this function contain no executable code so the performance statistics for those lines will always contain zero values.

To start a profiling session, invoke the `DBMS_PROFILER.START_PROFILER` function (or procedure). Once you've invoked `START_PROFILER`, Advanced Server will profile every PL/pgSQL or SPL function, procedure, trigger, or anonymous block that your session executes until you either stop or pause the profiler (by calling `STOP_PROFILER` or `PAUSE_PROFILER`).

It is important to note that when you start (or resume) the profiler, the profiler will only gather performance statistics for functions/procedures/triggers that start after the call to `START_PROFILER` (or `RESUME_PROFILER`).

While the profiler is active, Advanced Server records a large set of timers and counters in memory; when you invoke the `STOP_PROFILER` (or `FLUSH_DATA`) function/procedure, `DBMS_PROFILER` writes those timers and counters to a set of three tables:

  - `SYS.PLSQL_PROFILER_RAWDATA`
    
    Contains the performance counters and timers for each statement executed within the session.

  - `SYS.PLSQL_PROFILER_RUNS`
    
    Contains a summary of each run (aggregating the information found in `PLSQL_PROFILER_RAWDATA`).

  - `SYS.PLSQL_PROFILER_UNITS`
    
    Contains a summary of each code unit (function, procedure, trigger, or anonymous block) executed within a session.

In addition, `DBMS_PROFILER` defines a view, `SYS.PLSQL_PROFILER_DATA`, which contains a subset of the `PLSQL_PROFILER_RAWDATA` table.

Please note that a non-superuser may gather profiling information, but may not view that profiling information unless a superuser grants specific privileges on the profiling tables (stored in the `SYS` schema). This permits a non-privileged user to gather performance statistics without exposing information that the administrator may want to keep secret.

### Querying the DBMS_PROFILER Tables and View

The following step-by-step example uses `DBMS_PROFILER` to retrieve performance information for procedures, functions, and triggers included in the sample data distributed with Advanced Server.

1.  Open the EDB-PSQL command line, and establish a connection to the Advanced Server database. Use an `EXEC` statement to start the profiling session:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
acctg=# EXEC dbms_profiler.start_profiler('profile list_emp');

EDB-SPL Procedure successfully completed
```

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

(The call to `start_profiler()` includes a comment that `DBMS_PROFILER` associates with the profiler session).

</div>

2.  Then call the `list_emp` function:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
acctg=# SELECT list_emp();
INFO:  EMPNO    ENAME
INFO:  -----    -------
INFO:  7369     SMITH
INFO:  7499     ALLEN
INFO:  7521     WARD
INFO:  7566     JONES
INFO:  7654     MARTIN
INFO:  7698     BLAKE
INFO:  7782     CLARK
INFO:  7788     SCOTT
INFO:  7839     KING
INFO:  7844     TURNER
INFO:  7876     ADAMS
INFO:  7900     JAMES
INFO:  7902     FORD
INFO:  7934     MILLER
 list_emp
----------

(1 row)
```

3.  Stop the profiling session with a call to `dbms_profiler.stop_profiler:`

<!-- end list -->

``` text
acctg=# EXEC dbms_profiler.stop_profiler;

EDB-SPL Procedure successfully completed
```

4.  Start a new session with the `dbms_profiler.start_profiler` function (followed by a new comment):

<!-- end list -->

``` text
acctg=# EXEC dbms_profiler.start_profiler('profile get_dept_name and
emp_sal_trig');

EDB-SPL Procedure successfully completed
```

5.  Invoke the `get_dept_name` function:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
acctg=# SELECT get_dept_name(10);
 get_dept_name
---------------
 ACCOUNTING
(1 row)
```

6.  Execute an `UPDATE` statement that causes a trigger to execute:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
acctg=# UPDATE memp SET sal = 500 WHERE empno = 7902;
INFO: Updating employee 7902
INFO: ..Old salary: 3000.00
INFO: ..New salary: 500.00
INFO: ..Raise: -2500.00
INFO: User enterprisedb updated employee(s) on 04-FEB-14
UPDATE 1
```

7.  Terminate the profiling session and flush the performance information to the profiling tables:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
acctg=# EXEC dbms_profiler.stop_profiler;

EDB-SPL Procedure successfully completed
```

8.  Now, query the `plsql_profiler_runs` table to view a list of the profiling sessions, arranged by `runid:`

<!-- end list -->

``` text
acctg=# SELECT * FROM plsql_profiler_runs;
 runid | related_run |  run_owner   |         run_date          |              run_comment
|run_total_time | run_system_info | run_comment1 | spare1
-------+-------------+--------------+---------------------------+----------------------------------------+----------------+-----------------+--------------+--------
     1 |             | enterprisedb | 04-FEB-14 09:32:48.874315 | profile list_emp                       |           4154 |                 |              |
     2 |             | enterprisedb | 04-FEB-14 09:41:30.546503 | profile get_dept_name and emp_sal_trig |           2088 |                 |              |
(2 rows)
```

9.  Query the `plsql_profiler_units` table to view the amount of time consumed by each unit (each function, procedure, or trigger):

<!-- end list -->

``` text
acctg=# SELECT * FROM plsql_profiler_units;
 runid | unit_number | unit_type |  unit_owner  |            unit_name            | unit_timestamp | total_time | spare1 | spare2
-------+-------------+-----------+--------------+---------------------------------+----------------+------------+--------+--------
     1 |       16999 | FUNCTION  | enterprisedb | list_emp()                      |                |          4 |        |
     2 |       17002 | FUNCTION  | enterprisedb | user_audit_trig()               |                |          1 |        |
     2 |       17000 | FUNCTION  | enterprisedb | get_dept_name(p_deptno numeric) |                |          1 |        |
     2 |       17004 | FUNCTION  | enterprisedb | emp_sal_trig()                  |                |          1 |        |
(4 rows)
```

10. Query the `plsql_profiler_rawdata` table to view a list of the wait event counters and wait event times:

<!-- end list -->

``` text
acctg=# SELECT runid, sourcecode, func_oid, line_number, exec_count, tuples_returned, time_total FROM plsql_profiler_rawdata;

 runid |                            sourcecode                           | func_oid | line_number | exec_count | tuples_returned | time_total
