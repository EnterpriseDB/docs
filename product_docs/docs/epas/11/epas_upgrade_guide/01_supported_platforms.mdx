For information about the platforms and versions supported by Advanced Server, visit the EnterpriseDB website at:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/services-support/edb-supported-products-and-platforms#epas>

!!! Note
    Advanced Server is no longer supported on RHEL/CentOS/OL 6.x platforms. It is strongly recommended that EDB products running on these platforms be migrated to a supported platform.
