Advanced Server provides pattern matching using the traditional SQL `LIKE` operator. The syntax for the `LIKE` operator is as follows.

```text
string LIKE pattern [ ESCAPE escape-character ]
string NOT LIKE pattern [ ESCAPE escape-character ]
```

Every `pattern` defines a set of strings. The `LIKE` expression returns `TRUE` if `string` is contained in the set of strings represented by `pattern`. As expected, the `NOT LIKE` expression returns `FALSE` if `LIKE` returns `TRUE`, and vice versa. An equivalent expression is `NOT (string LIKE pattern)`.

If `pattern` does not contain percent signs or underscore, then the pattern only represents the string itself; in that case `LIKE` acts like the equals operator. An underscore (`_`) in `pattern` stands for (matches) any single character; a percent sign (`%`) matches any string of zero or more characters.

Some examples:

```text
'abc' LIKE 'abc'    true
'abc' LIKE 'a%'     true
'abc' LIKE '_b_'    true
'abc' LIKE 'c'      false
```

`LIKE` pattern matches always cover the entire string. To match a pattern anywhere within a string, the pattern must therefore start and end with a percent sign.

To match a literal underscore or percent sign without matching other characters, the respective character in `pattern` must be preceded by the escape character. The default escape character is the backslash but a different one may be selected by using the `ESCAPE` clause. To match the escape character itself, write two escape characters.

Note that the backslash already has a special meaning in string literals, so to write a pattern constant that contains a backslash you must write two backslashes in an SQL statement. Thus, writing a pattern that actually matches a literal backslash means writing four backslashes in the statement. You can avoid this by selecting a different escape character with `ESCAPE`; then a backslash is not special to `LIKE` anymore. (But it is still special to the string literal parser, so you still need two of them.)

Itâ€™s also possible to select no escape character by writing `ESCAPE ''`. This effectively disables the escape mechanism, which makes it impossible to turn off the special meaning of underscore and percent signs in the pattern.
