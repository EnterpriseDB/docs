A *nested table* is a type of collection that associates a positive integer with a value. A nested table has the following characteristics:

-   A *nested table type* must be defined after which *nested table variables* can be declared of that nested table type. Data manipulation occurs using the nested table variable, or simply, “table” for short.
-   When a nested table variable is declared, the nested table initially does not exist (it is a null collection). The null table must be initialized with a *constructor*. You can also initialize the table by using an assignment statement where the right-hand side of the assignment is an initialized table of the same type. **Note:** Initialization of a nested table is mandatory in Oracle, but optional in SPL.
-   The key is a positive integer.
-   The constructor establishes the number of elements in the table. The `EXTEND` method adds additional elements to the table. See [Collection Methods](../11_collection_methods/#collection_methods) for information on collection methods. **Note:** Usage of the constructor to establish the number of elements in the table and usage of the `EXTEND` method to add additional elements to the table are mandatory in Oracle, but optional in SPL.
-   The table can be sparse - there may be gaps in the assignment of values to keys.
-   An attempt to reference a table element beyond its initialized or extended size will result in a `SUBSCRIPT_BEYOND_COUNT` exception.

The `TYPE IS TABLE` statement is used to define a nested table type within the declaration section of an SPL program.

```text
TYPE <tbltype> IS TABLE OF { <datatype> | <rectype> | <objtype> };
```

`tbltype` is an identifier assigned to the nested table type. `datatype` is a scalar data type such as `VARCHAR2` or `NUMBER`. `rectype` is a previously defined record type. `objtype` is a previously defined object type.

!!! Note
    You can use the `CREATE TYPE` command to define a nested table type that is available to all SPL programs in the database. See the Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Reference Guide for more information about the `CREATE TYPE` command.

In order to make use of the table, a *variable* must be declared of that nested table type. The following is the syntax for declaring a table variable.

```text
<table tbltype>
```

`table` is an identifier assigned to the nested table. `tbltype` is the identifier of a previously defined nested table type.

A nested table is initialized using the nested table type’s constructor.

```text
<tbltype> ([ { <expr1> | NULL } [, { <expr2> | NULL } ] [, ...] ])
```

`tbltype` is the identifier of the nested table type’s constructor, which has the same name as the nested table type. `expr1, expr2, …` are expressions that are type-compatible with the element type of the table. If `NULL` is specified, the corresponding element is set to null. If the parameter list is empty, then an empty nested table is returned, which means there are no elements in the table. If the table is defined from an object type, then `exprn` must return an object of that object type. The object can be the return value of a function or the object type’s constructor, or the object can be an element of another nested table of the same type.

If a collection method other than `EXISTS` is applied to an uninitialized nested table, a `COLLECTION_IS_NULL` exception is thrown. See [Collection Methods](../11_collection_methods/#collection_methods) for information on collection methods.

The following is an example of a constructor for a nested table:

```text
DECLARE
    TYPE nested_typ IS TABLE OF CHAR(1);
    v_nested        nested_typ := nested_typ('A','B');
```

An element of the table is referenced using the following syntax.

```text
<table>(<n>)[<.element> ]
```

`table` is the identifier of a previously declared table. `n` is a positive integer. If the table type of `table` is defined from a record type or object type, then `[.element  ]` must reference an individual field within the record type or attribute within the object type from which the nested table type is defined. Alternatively, the entire record or object can be referenced by omitting `[.element  ]`.

The following is an example of a nested table where it is known that there will be four elements.

```text
DECLARE
    TYPE dname_tbl_typ IS TABLE OF VARCHAR2(14);
    dname_tbl       dname_tbl_typ;
    CURSOR dept_cur IS SELECT dname FROM dept ORDER BY dname;
    i               INTEGER := 0;
BEGIN
    dname_tbl := dname_tbl_typ(NULL, NULL, NULL, NULL);
    FOR r_dept IN dept_cur LOOP
        i := i + 1;
        dname_tbl(i) := r_dept.dname;
    END LOOP;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('DNAME');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('----------');
    FOR j IN 1..i LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(dname_tbl(j));
    END LOOP;
END;
```

The above example produces the following output:

```text
DNAME
----------
ACCOUNTING
OPERATIONS
RESEARCH
SALES
```

The following example reads the first ten employee names from the `emp` table, stores them in a nested table, then displays the results from the table. The SPL code is written to assume that the number of employees to be returned is not known beforehand.

```text
DECLARE
    TYPE emp_rec_typ IS RECORD (
        empno       NUMBER(4),
        ename       VARCHAR2(10)
    );
    TYPE emp_tbl_typ IS TABLE OF emp_rec_typ;
    emp_tbl         emp_tbl_typ;
    CURSOR emp_cur IS SELECT empno, ename FROM emp WHERE ROWNUM <= 10;
    i               INTEGER := 0;
BEGIN
    emp_tbl := emp_tbl_typ();
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('EMPNO    ENAME');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('-----    -------');
    FOR r_emp IN emp_cur LOOP
        i := i + 1;
        emp_tbl.EXTEND;
        emp_tbl(i) := r_emp;
    END LOOP;
    FOR j IN 1..10 LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(emp_tbl(j).empno || '     ' ||
            emp_tbl(j).ename);
    END LOOP;
END;
```

Note the creation of an empty table with the constructor `emp_tbl_typ()` as the first statement in the executable section of the anonymous block. The `EXTEND` collection method is then used to add an element to the table for each employee returned from the result set. See [Extend](../11_collection_methods/04_extend/#extend) for information on `EXTEND`.

The following is the output.

```text
EMPNO    ENAME
-----    -------
7369     SMITH
7499     ALLEN
7521     WARD
7566     JONES
7654     MARTIN
7698     BLAKE
7782     CLARK
7788     SCOTT
7839     KING
7844     TURNER
```

The following example shows how a nested table of an object type can be used. First, an object type is created with attributes for the department name and location.

```text
CREATE TYPE dept_obj_typ AS OBJECT (
    dname           VARCHAR2(14),
    loc             VARCHAR2(13)
);
```

The following anonymous block defines a nested table type whose element consists of the `dept_obj_typ` object type. A nested table variable is declared, initialized, and then populated from the `dept` table. Finally, the elements from the nested table are displayed.

```text
DECLARE
    TYPE dept_tbl_typ IS TABLE OF dept_obj_typ;
    dept_tbl        dept_tbl_typ;
    CURSOR dept_cur IS SELECT dname, loc FROM dept ORDER BY dname;
    i               INTEGER := 0;
BEGIN
    dept_tbl := dept_tbl_typ(
        dept_obj_typ(NULL,NULL),
        dept_obj_typ(NULL,NULL),
        dept_obj_typ(NULL,NULL),
        dept_obj_typ(NULL,NULL)
    );
    FOR r_dept IN dept_cur LOOP
        i := i + 1;
        dept_tbl(i).dname := r_dept.dname;
        dept_tbl(i).loc   := r_dept.loc;
    END LOOP;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('DNAME          LOC');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('----------     ----------');
    FOR j IN 1..i LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(RPAD(dept_tbl(j).dname,14) || ' ' ||
            dept_tbl(j).loc);
    END LOOP;
END;
```

The parameters comprising the nested table’s constructor, `dept_tbl_typ`, are calls to the object type’s constructor `dept_obj_typ.` The following is the output from the anonymous block:

```text
DNAME          LOC
----------     ----------
ACCOUNTING     NEW YORK
OPERATIONS     BOSTON
RESEARCH       DALLAS
SALES          CHICAGO
```
