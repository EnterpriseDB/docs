<div id="spl_block_structure" class="registered_link"></div>

Regardless of whether the program is a procedure, function, subprogram, or trigger, an SPL program has the same *block* structure. A block consists of up to three sections - an optional declaration section, a mandatory executable section, and an optional exception section. Minimally, a block has an executable section that consists of one or more SPL statements within the keywords, `BEGIN` and `END`.

The optional declaration section is used to declare variables, cursors, types, and subprograms that are used by the statements within the executable and exception sections. Declarations appear just prior to the `BEGIN` keyword of the executable section. Depending upon the context of where the block is used, the declaration section may begin with the keyword `DECLARE`.

You can include an exception section within the `BEGIN - END` block. The exception section begins with the keyword, `EXCEPTION`, and continues until the end of the block in which it appears. If an exception is thrown by a statement within the block, program control goes to the exception section where the thrown exception may or may not be handled depending upon the exception and the contents of the exception section.

The following is the general structure of a block:

```text
[ [ DECLARE ]
      <pragmas>
      <declarations> ]
    BEGIN
      <statements>
  [ EXCEPTION
      WHEN <exception_condition> THEN
        <statements> [, ...] ]
    END;
```

`pragmas` are the directives (`AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` is the currently supported pragma). `declarations` are one or more variable, cursor, type, or subprogram declarations that are local to the block. If subprogram declarations are included, they must be declared after all other variable, cursor, and type declarations. Each declaration must be terminated by a semicolon. The use of the keyword `DECLARE` depends upon the context in which the block appears.

`statements` are one or more SPL statements. Each statement must be terminated by a semicolon. The end of the block denoted by the keyword `END` must also be terminated by a semicolon.

If present, the keyword `EXCEPTION` marks the beginning of the exception section. `exception_condition` is a conditional expression testing for one or more types of exceptions. If an exception matches one of the exceptions in `exception_condition`, the `statements` following the `WHEN exception_condition` clause are executed. There may be one or more `WHEN exception_condition` clauses, each followed by `statements`.

!!! Note
    A `BEGIN/END` block in itself, is considered a statement; thus, blocks may be nested. The exception section may also contain nested blocks.

The following is the simplest possible block consisting of the `NULL` statement within the executable section. The `NULL` statement is an executable statement that does nothing.

```text
BEGIN
   NULL;
END;
```

The following block contains a declaration section as well as the executable section.

```text
DECLARE
    v_numerator     NUMBER(2);
    v_denominator   NUMBER(2);
    v_result        NUMBER(5,2);
BEGIN
   v_numerator := 75;
   v_denominator := 14;
   v_result := v_numerator / v_denominator;
   DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_numerator || ' divided by ' || v_denominator ||
       ' is ' || v_result);
END;
```

In this example, three numeric variables are declared of data type `NUMBER`. Values are assigned to two of the variables, and one number is divided by the other, storing the results in a third variable which is then displayed. If executed, the output would be:

```text
75 divided by 14 is 5.36
```

The following block consists of a declaration, an executable, and an exception:

```text
DECLARE
    v_numerator     NUMBER(2);
    v_denominator   NUMBER(2);
    v_result        NUMBER(5,2);
BEGIN
   v_numerator := 75;
   v_denominator := 0;
   v_result := v_numerator / v_denominator;
   DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_numerator || ' divided by ' || v_denominator ||
       ' is ' || v_result);
EXCEPTION
    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('An exception occurred');
END;
```

The following output shows that the statement within the exception section is executed as a result of the division by zero.

```text
An exception occurred
```
