title: "Opening a Cursor Variable"

---

<div id="opening_a_cursor_variable" class="registered_link"></div>

Once a cursor variable is declared, it must be opened with an associated `SELECT` command. The `OPEN FOR` statement specifies the `SELECT` command to be used to create the result set.

```text
OPEN <name> FOR query;
```

`name` is the identifier of a previously declared cursor variable. `query` is a `SELECT` command that determines the result set when the statement is executed. The value of the cursor variable after the `OPEN FOR` statement is executed identifies the result set.

In the following example, the result set is a list of employee numbers and names from a selected department. Note that a variable or parameter can be used in the `SELECT` command anywhere an expression can normally appear. In this case a parameter is used in the equality test for department number.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE emp_by_dept (
    p_deptno        emp.deptno%TYPE
)
IS
    emp_refcur      SYS_REFCURSOR;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_refcur FOR SELECT empno, ename FROM emp WHERE deptno = p_deptno;
        ...
```
