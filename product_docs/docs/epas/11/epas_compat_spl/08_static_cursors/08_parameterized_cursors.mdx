A user can also declare a static cursor that accepts parameters, and can pass values for those parameters when opening that cursor. In the following example we have created a parameterized cursor which will display the name and salary of all employees from the `emp` table that have a salary less than a specified value which is passed as a parameter.

```text
DECLARE
    my_record       emp%ROWTYPE;
    CURSOR c1 (max_wage NUMBER) IS
        SELECT * FROM emp WHERE sal < max_wage;
BEGIN
    OPEN c1(2000);
    LOOP
        FETCH c1 INTO my_record;
        EXIT WHEN c1%NOTFOUND;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Name = ' || my_record.ename || ', salary = '
            || my_record.sal);
    END LOOP;
    CLOSE c1;
END;
```

So for example if we pass the value 2000 as `max_wage`, then we will only be shown the name and salary of all employees that have a salary less than 2000. The result of the above query is the following:

```text
Name = SMITH, salary = 800.00
Name = ALLEN, salary = 1600.00
Name = WARD, salary = 1250.00
Name = MARTIN, salary = 1250.00
Name = TURNER, salary = 1500.00
Name = ADAMS, salary = 1100.00
Name = JAMES, salary = 950.00
Name = MILLER, salary = 1300.00
```
