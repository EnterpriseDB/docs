title: "%FOUND"

<div id="%found" class="registered_link"></div>

The `%FOUND` attribute is used to test whether or not a row is retrieved from the result set of the specified cursor after a `FETCH` on the cursor.

```text
<cursor_name>%FOUND
```

`cursor_name` is the name of the cursor for which a `BOOLEAN` data type of `TRUE` will be returned if a row is retrieved from the result set of the cursor after a `FETCH`.

After the last row of the result set has been fetched the next `FETCH` results in `%FOUND` returning `FALSE`. `FALSE` is also returned after the first `FETCH` if there are no rows in the result set to begin with.

Referencing `%FOUND` on a cursor before it is opened or after it is closed results in an `INVALID_CURSOR` exception being thrown.

`%FOUND` returns `null` if it is referenced when the cursor is open, but before the first `FETCH`.

The following example uses `%FOUND`.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    v_emp_rec       emp%ROWTYPE;
    CURSOR emp_cur_1 IS SELECT * FROM emp;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_1;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('EMPNO    ENAME');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('-----    -------');
    FETCH emp_cur_1 INTO v_emp_rec;
    WHILE emp_cur_1%FOUND LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_emp_rec.empno || '     ' || v_emp_rec.ename);
        FETCH emp_cur_1 INTO v_emp_rec;
    END LOOP;
    CLOSE emp_cur_1;
END;
```

When the previous procedure is invoked, the output appears as follows:

```text
EXEC cursor_example;

EMPNO    ENAME
-----    ------
7369     SMITH
7499     ALLEN
7521     WARD
7566     JONES
7654     MARTIN
7698     BLAKE
7782     CLARK
7788     SCOTT
7839     KING
7844     TURNER
7876     ADAMS
7900     JAMES
7902     FORD
7934     MILLER
