The `SELECT INTO` statement is an SPL variation of the SQL `SELECT` command, the differences being:

-   That `SELECT INTO` is designed to assign the results to variables or records where they can then be used in SPL program statements.
-   The accessible result set of `SELECT INTO` is at most one row.

Other than the above, all of the clauses of the `SELECT` command such as `WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING`, etc. are valid for `SELECT INTO`. The following are the two variations of `SELECT INTO`.

```text
SELECT <select_expressions> INTO <target> FROM ...;
```

`target` is a comma-separated list of simple variables. `select_expressions` and the remainder of the statement are the same as for the `SELECT` command. The selected values must exactly match in data type, number, and order the structure of the target or a runtime error occurs.

```text
SELECT * INTO <record> FROM <table> ...;
```

`record` is a record variable that has previously been declared.

If the query returns zero rows, null values are assigned to the target(s). If the query returns multiple rows, the first row is assigned to the target(s) and the rest are discarded. (Note that "the first row" is not well-defined unless you’ve used `ORDER BY.`)

!!! Note
    -   In either cases, where no row is returned or more than one row is returned, SPL throws an exception.

    -   There is a variation of `SELECT INTO` using the `BULK COLLECT` clause that allows a result set of more than one row that is returned into a collection. See [SELECT BULK COLLECT](../12_working_with_collections/04_using_the_bulk_collect_clause/01_select_bulk_collect/#select_bulk_collect) for more information on using the `BULK COLLECT` clause with the `SELECT INTO` statement.

You can use the `WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND` clause in an `EXCEPTION` block to determine whether the assignment was successful (that is, at least one row was returned by the query).

This version of the `emp_sal_query` procedure uses the variation of `SELECT INTO` that returns the result set into a record. Also note the addition of the `EXCEPTION` block containing the `WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND` conditional expression.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE emp_sal_query (
    p_empno         IN emp.empno%TYPE
)
IS
    r_emp           emp%ROWTYPE;
    v_avgsal        emp.sal%TYPE;
BEGIN
    SELECT * INTO r_emp
        FROM emp WHERE empno = p_empno;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee # : ' || p_empno);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Name       : ' || r_emp.ename);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Job        : ' || r_emp.job);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hire Date  : ' || r_emp.hiredate);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Salary     : ' || r_emp.sal);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Dept #     : ' || r_emp.deptno);

    SELECT AVG(sal) INTO v_avgsal
        FROM emp WHERE deptno = r_emp.deptno;
    IF r_emp.sal > v_avgsal THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee''s salary is more than the '
            || 'department average of ' || v_avgsal);
    ELSE
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee''s salary does not exceed the '
            || 'department average of ' || v_avgsal);
    END IF;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN NO_DATA_FOUND THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee # ' || p_empno || ' not found');
END;
```

If the query is executed with a non-existent employee number the results appear as follows.

```text
EXEC emp_sal_query(0);

Employee # 0 not found
```

Another conditional clause of use in the `EXCEPTION` section with `SELECT INTO` is the `TOO_MANY_ROWS` exception. If more than one row is selected by the `SELECT INTO` statement an exception is thrown by SPL.

When the following block is executed, the `TOO_MANY_ROWS` exception is thrown since there are many employees in the specified department.

```text
DECLARE
    v_ename         emp.ename%TYPE;
BEGIN
    SELECT ename INTO v_ename FROM emp WHERE deptno = 20 ORDER BY ename;
EXCEPTION
    WHEN TOO_MANY_ROWS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('More than one employee found');
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('First employee returned is ' || v_ename);
END;

More than one employee found
First employee returned is ADAMS
```
