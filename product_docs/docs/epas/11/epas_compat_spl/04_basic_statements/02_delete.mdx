The `DELETE` command (available in the SQL language) can also be used in SPL programs.

An expression in the SPL language can be used wherever an expression is allowed in the SQL `DELETE` command. Thus, SPL variables and parameters can be used to supply values to the delete operation.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE emp_delete (
    p_empno         IN emp.empno%TYPE
)
IS
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM emp WHERE empno = p_empno;

    IF SQL%FOUND THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Deleted Employee # : ' || p_empno);
    ELSE
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee # ' || p_empno || ' not found');
    END IF;
END;
```

The `SQL%FOUND` conditional expression returns `TRUE` if a row is deleted, `FALSE` otherwise. See [Obtaining the Result Status](08_obtaining_the_result_status/#obtaining_the_result_status) for a discussion of `SQL%FOUND` and other similar expressions.

The following shows the deletion of an employee using this procedure.

```text
EXEC emp_delete(9503);

Deleted Employee # : 9503

SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno = 9503;

 empno | ename | job | mgr | hiredate | sal | comm | deptno
-------+-------+-----+-----+----------+-----+------+--------
(0 rows)
```

!!! Note
    The `DELETE` command can be included in a `FORALL` statement. A `FORALL` statement allows a single `DELETE` command to delete multiple rows from values supplied in one or more collections. See [Using the FORALL Statement](../12_working_with_collections/03_using_the_forall_statement/#using_the_forall_statement) for more information on the `FORALL` statement.
