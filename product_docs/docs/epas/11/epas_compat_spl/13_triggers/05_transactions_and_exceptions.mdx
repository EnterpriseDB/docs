<div id="transactions_and_exceptions" class="registered_link"></div>

A trigger is always executed as part of the same transaction within which the DML statement is executing. When no exceptions occur within the trigger code block, the effects of any DML commands within the trigger are committed if and only if the transaction containing the triggering statement is committed. Therefore, if the transaction is rolled back, the effects of any triggering commands within the trigger are also rolled back.

If an exception does occur within the trigger code block, but it is caught and handled in an exception section, the effects of any DML commands within the trigger are still rolled back nonetheless. The triggering statement itself, however, is not rolled back unless the application forces a roll back of the encapsulating transaction.

If an unhandled exception occurs within the trigger code block, the transaction that encapsulates the trigger is aborted and rolled back. Therefore, the effects of any DML commands within the trigger and the triggering statement, itself are all rolled back.
