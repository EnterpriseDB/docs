<div id="creating_object_types" class="registered_link"></div>

You can use the `CREATE TYPE` command to create an object type specification, and the `CREATE TYPE BODY` command to create an object type body. This section provides some examples using the `CREATE TYPE` and `CREATE TYPE BODY` commands.

The first example creates the `addr_object_type` object type that contains only attributes and no methods:

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE TYPE addr_object_type AS OBJECT
(
    street          VARCHAR2(30),
    city            VARCHAR2(20),
    state           CHAR(2),
    zip             NUMBER(5)
);
```

Since there are no methods in this object type, an object type body is not required. This example creates a composite type, which allows you to treat related objects as a single attribute.
