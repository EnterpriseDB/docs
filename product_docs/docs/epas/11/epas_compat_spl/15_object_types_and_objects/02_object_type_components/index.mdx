Object types are created and stored in the database by using the following two constructs of the SPL language:

-   The *object type specification* - This is the public interface specifying the attributes and method signatures of the object type.
-   The *object type body* - This contains the implementation of the methods specified in the object type specification.

The following sections describe the commands used to create the object type specification and the object type body.
