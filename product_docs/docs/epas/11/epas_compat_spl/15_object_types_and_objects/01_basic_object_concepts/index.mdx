An object type is a description or definition of some entity. This definition of an object type is characterized by two components:

-   *Attributes* – fields that describe particular characteristics of an object instance. For a person object, examples might be name, address, gender, date of birth, height, weight, eye color, occupation, etc.
-   *Methods* – programs that perform some type of function or operation on, or related to an object. For a person object, examples might be calculating the person’s age, displaying the person’s attributes, changing the values assigned to the person’s attributes, etc.

The following sections elaborate on some basic object concepts.
