<div id="deletes" class="registered_link"></div>

The `DELETE` method deletes entries from a collection. You can call the `DELETE` method in three different ways.

Use the first form of the `DELETE` method to remove all entries from a collection:

```text
<collection>.DELETE
```

Use the second form of the `DELETE` method to remove the specified entry from a collection:

```text
<collection>.DELETE(<subscript>)
```

Use the third form of the `DELETE` method to remove the entries that are within the range specified by `first_subscript` and `last_subscript` (including the entries for the `first_subscript` and the `last_subscript`) from a collection.

```text
<collection>.DELETE(<first_subscript>, <last_subscript>)
```

If `first_subscript` and `last_subscript` refer to non-existent elements, elements that are in the range between the specified subscripts are deleted. If `first_subscript` is greater than `last_subscript`, or if you specify a value of `NULL` for one of the arguments, `DELETE` has no effect.

Note that when you delete an entry, the subscript remains in the collection; you can re-use the subscript with an alternate entry. If you specify a subscript that does not exist in the call to the `DELETE` method, `DELETE` does not raise an exception.

The following example demonstrates using the `DELETE` method to remove the element with subscript `0` from the collection:

```text
DECLARE
    TYPE sparse_arr_typ IS TABLE OF NUMBER INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;
    sparse_arr      sparse_arr_typ;
    v_results       VARCHAR2(50);
    v_sub           NUMBER;
BEGIN
    sparse_arr(-100)  := -100;
    sparse_arr(-10)   := -10;
    sparse_arr(0)     := 0;
    sparse_arr(10)    := 10;
    sparse_arr(100)   := 100;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('COUNT: ' || sparse_arr.COUNT);
    sparse_arr.DELETE(0);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('COUNT: ' || sparse_arr.COUNT);
    v_sub := sparse_arr.FIRST;
    WHILE v_sub IS NOT NULL LOOP
        IF sparse_arr(v_sub) IS NULL THEN
            v_results := v_results || 'NULL ';
        ELSE
            v_results := v_results || sparse_arr(v_sub) || ' ';
        END IF;
        v_sub := sparse_arr.NEXT(v_sub);
    END LOOP;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Results: ' || v_results);
END;

COUNT: 5
COUNT: 4
Results: -100 -10 10 100
```

`COUNT` indicates that before the `DELETE` method, there were `5` elements in the collection; after the `DELETE` method was invoked, the collection contains `4` elements.
