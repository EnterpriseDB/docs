**Description**

The `REVOKE` command revokes previously granted privileges from one or more roles. The key word `PUBLIC` refers to the implicitly defined group of all roles.

See the description of the `GRANT` command for the meaning of the privilege types.

Note that any particular role will have the sum of privileges granted directly to it, privileges granted to any role it is presently a member of, and privileges granted to `PUBLIC`. Thus, for example, revoking `SELECT` privilege from `PUBLIC` does not necessarily mean that all roles have lost `SELECT` privilege on the object: those who have it granted directly or via another role will still have it.

If the privilege had been granted with the grant option, the grant option for the privilege is revoked as well as the privilege, itself.

If a user holds a privilege with grant option and has granted it to other users then the privileges held by those other users are called dependent privileges. If the privilege or the grant option held by the first user is being revoked and dependent privileges exist, those dependent privileges are also revoked if `CASCADE` is specified, else the revoke action will fail. This recursive revocation only affects privileges that were granted through a chain of users that is traceable to the user that is the subject of this `REVOKE` command. Thus, the affected users may effectively keep the privilege if it was also granted through other users.

!!! Note
    `CASCADE` is not an option compatible with Oracle databases. By default Oracle always cascades dependent privileges, but Advanced Server requires the `CASCADE` keyword to be explicitly given, otherwise the `REVOKE` command will fail.

When revoking membership in a role, `GRANT OPTION` is instead called `ADMIN OPTION`, but the behavior is similar.

**Notes**

A user can only revoke privileges that were granted directly by that user. If, for example, user `A` has granted a privilege with grant option to user `B`, and user `B` has in turned granted it to user `C`, then user `A` cannot revoke the privilege directly from `C`. Instead, user `A` could revoke the grant option from user `B` and use the `CASCADE` option so that the privilege is in turn revoked from user `C`. For another example, if both `A` and `B` have granted the same privilege to `C`, `A` can revoke his own grant but not `B`’s grant, so `C` will still effectively have the privilege.

When a non-owner of an object attempts to `REVOKE` privileges on the object, the command will fail outright if the user has no privileges whatsoever on the object. As long as some privilege is available, the command will proceed, but it will revoke only those privileges for which the user has grant options. The `REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES` forms will issue a warning message if no grant options are held, while the other forms will issue a warning if grant options for any of the privileges specifically named in the command are not held. (In principle these statements apply to the object owner as well, but since the owner is always treated as holding all grant options, the cases can never occur.)

If a superuser chooses to issue a `GRANT` or `REVOKE` command, the command is performed as though it were issued by the owner of the affected object. Since all privileges ultimately come from the object owner (possibly indirectly via chains of grant options), it is possible for a superuser to revoke all privileges, but this may require use of `CASCADE` as stated above.

`REVOKE` can also be done by a role that is not the owner of the affected object, but is a member of the role that owns the object, or is a member of a role that holds privileges `WITH GRANT OPTION` on the object. In this case the command is performed as though it were issued by the containing role that actually owns the object or holds the privileges `WITH GRANT OPTION`. For example, if table `t1` is owned by role `g1`, of which role `u1` is a member, then `u1` can revoke privileges on `t1` that are recorded as being granted by `g1`. This would include grants made by `u1` as well as by other members of role `g1`.

If the role executing `REVOKE` holds privileges indirectly via more than one role membership path, it is unspecified which containing role will be used to perform the command. In such cases it is best practice to use `SET ROLE` to become the specific role you want to do the `REVOKE` as. Failure to do so may lead to revoking privileges other than the ones you intended, or not revoking anything at all.

!!! Note
    The Advanced Server `ALTER ROLE` command also supports syntax that revokes the system privileges required to create a public or private database link, or exemptions from fine-grained access control policies (`DBMS_RLS`). The `ALTER ROLE` syntax is functionally equivalent to the respective `REVOKE` command, compatible with Oracle databases.

**Examples**

Revoke insert privilege for the public on table `emp`:

```text
REVOKE INSERT ON emp FROM PUBLIC;
```

Revoke all privileges from user `mary` on view `salesemp`:

```text
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON salesemp FROM mary;
```

Note that this actually means “revoke all privileges that I granted”.

Revoke membership in role `admins` from user `joe`:

```text
REVOKE admins FROM joe;
```

Revoke `CONNECT` privilege from user `joe`:

```text
REVOKE CONNECT FROM joe;
```

Revoke `CREATE DATABASE LINK` privilege from user `joe`:

```text
REVOKE CREATE DATABASE LINK FROM joe;
```

Revoke the `EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY` privilege from user `joe`:

```text
REVOKE EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY FROM joe;
```
