**Description**

`CREATE PACKAGE BODY` defines a new package body. `CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY` will either create a new package body, or replace an existing body.

If a schema name is included, then the package body is created in the specified schema. Otherwise it is created in the current schema. The name of the new package body must match an existing package specification in the same schema. The new package body name must not match any existing package body in the same schema unless the intent is to update the definition of an existing package body, in which case use `CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY`.

**Parameters**

`name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the package body to create.

`declaration`

 A private variable, type, cursor, or `REF CURSOR` declaration.

`proc_name`

 The name of a public or private procedure. If `proc_name` exists in the package specification with an identical signature, then it is public, otherwise it is private.

`argname`

 The name of an argument.

`IN | IN OUT | OUT`

 The argument mode.

`argtype`

 The data type(s) of the program’s arguments.

`DEFAULT value`

 Default value of an input argument.

`STRICT`

 The `STRICT` keyword specifies that the function will not be executed if called with a `NULL` argument; instead the function will return `NULL`.

`LEAKPROOF`

 The `LEAKPROOF` keyword specifies that the function will not reveal any information about arguments, other than through a return value.

`PARALLEL { UNSAFE | RESTRICTED | SAFE }`

 The `PARALLEL` clause enables the use of parallel sequential scans (parallel mode). A parallel sequential scan uses multiple workers to scan a relation in parallel during a query in contrast to a serial sequential scan.

-   When set to `UNSAFE`, the procedure or function cannot be executed in parallel mode. The presence of such a procedure or function forces a serial execution plan. This is the default setting if the `PARALLEL` clause is omitted.

-   When set to `RESTRICTED`, the procedure or function can be executed in parallel mode, but the execution is restricted to the parallel group leader. If the qualification for any particular relation has anything that is parallel restricted, that relation won't be chosen for parallelism.

-   When set to `SAFE`, the procedure or function can be executed in parallel mode with no restriction.

`execution_cost`

 `execution_cost` specifies a positive number giving the estimated execution cost for the function, in units of `cpu_operator_cost`. If the function returns a set, this is the cost per returned row. The default is `0.0025`.

`result_rows`

 `result_rows` is the estimated number of rows that the query planner should expect the function to return. The default is `1000`.

`SET`

 Use the `SET` clause to specify a parameter value for the duration of the function:

-   `config_param` specifies the parameter name.

-   `value` specifies the parameter value.

-   `FROM CURRENT` guarantees that the parameter value is restored when the function ends.

`program_body`

 The pragma, declarations, and SPL statements that comprise the body of the function or procedure.

 The pragma may be `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` to set the function or procedure as an autonomous transaction.

 The declarations may include variable, type, `REF CURSOR`, or subprogram declarations. If subprogram declarations are included, they must be declared after all other variable, type, and `REF CURSOR` declarations.

`func_name`

 The name of a public or private function. If `func_name` exists in the package specification with an identical signature, then it is public, otherwise it is private.

`rettype`

 The return data type.

`DETERMINISTIC`

 Include `DETERMINISTIC` to specify that the function will always return the same result when given the same argument values. A `DETERMINISTIC` function must not modify the database.

 **Note**: The `DETERMINISTIC` keyword is equivalent to the PostgreSQL `IMMUTABLE` option. If `DETERMINISTIC` is specified for a public function in the package body, it must also be specified for the function declaration in the package specification. For private functions, there is no function declaration in the package specification.

`statement`

 An SPL program statement. Statements in the package initialization section are executed once per session the first time the package is referenced.

!!! Note
    The `STRICT`, `LEAKPROOF`, `PARALLEL`, `COST`, `ROWS` and `SET` keywords provide extended functionality for Advanced Server and are not supported by Oracle.

**Examples**

The following is the package body for the `empinfo` package.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY empinfo
IS
    v_counter       INTEGER;
    PROCEDURE get_name (
        p_empno     NUMBER
    )
    IS
    BEGIN
        SELECT ename INTO emp_name FROM emp WHERE empno = p_empno;
        v_counter := v_counter + 1;
    END;
    FUNCTION display_counter
    RETURN INTEGER
    IS
    BEGIN
        RETURN v_counter;
    END;
BEGIN
    v_counter := 0;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Initialized counter');
END;
```

The following two anonymous blocks execute the procedure and function in the `empinfo` package and display the public variable.

```text
BEGIN
    empinfo.get_name(7369);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee Name    : ' || empinfo.emp_name);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Number of queries: ' || empinfo.display_counter);
END;

Initialized counter
Employee Name    : SMITH
Number of queries: 1

BEGIN
    empinfo.get_name(7900);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee Name    : ' || empinfo.emp_name);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Number of queries: ' || empinfo.display_counter);
END;

Employee Name    : JAMES
Number of queries: 2
```
