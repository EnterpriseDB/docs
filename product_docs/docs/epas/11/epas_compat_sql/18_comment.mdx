<div id="comment" class="registered_link"></div>

**Name**

`COMMENT` -- define or change the comment of an object.

**Synopsis**

```text
COMMENT ON
{
  TABLE <table_name> |
  COLUMN <table_name.column_name>
} IS '<text>'
```

**Description**

`COMMENT` stores a comment about a database object. To modify a comment, issue a new `COMMENT` command for the same object. Only one comment string is stored for each object. To remove a comment, specify the empty string (two consecutive single quotes with no intervening space) for `text`. Comments are automatically dropped when the object is dropped.

**Parameters**

`table_name`

 The name of the table to be commented. The table name may be schema-qualified.

`table_name.column_name`

 The name of a column within `table_name` to be commented. The table name may be schema-qualified.

`text`

 The new comment.

**Notes**

There is presently no security mechanism for comments: any user connected to a database can see all the comments for objects in that database (although only superusers can change comments for objects that they donâ€™t own). `Do not put security-critical information in a comment`.

**Examples**

Attach a comment to the table `emp`:

```text
COMMENT ON TABLE emp IS 'Current employee information';
```

Attach a comment to the `empno` column of the `emp` table:

```text
COMMENT ON COLUMN emp.empno IS 'Employee identification number';
```

Remove these comments:

```text
COMMENT ON TABLE emp IS '';
COMMENT ON COLUMN emp.empno IS '';
```
