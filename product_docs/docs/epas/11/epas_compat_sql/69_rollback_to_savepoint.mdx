**Name**

`ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` -- roll back to a savepoint.

**Synopsis**

```text
ROLLBACK [ WORK ] TO [ SAVEPOINT ] <savepoint_name>
```

**Description**

Roll back all commands that were executed after the savepoint was established. The savepoint remains valid and can be rolled back to again, if needed.

`ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` destroys all savepoints that were established after the named savepoint.

**Parameters**

`savepoint_name`

 The savepoint to which to roll back.

**Notes**

Specifying a savepoint name that has not been established is an error.

`ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` is not supported within SPL programs.

**Examples**

To undo the effects of the commands executed savepoint `depts` was established:

```text
\set AUTOCOMMIT off
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50, 'HR', 'NEW YORK');
SAVEPOINT depts;
INSERT INTO emp (empno, ename, deptno) VALUES (9001, 'JONES', 50);
INSERT INTO emp (empno, ename, deptno) VALUES (9002, 'ALICE', 50);
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT depts;
```
