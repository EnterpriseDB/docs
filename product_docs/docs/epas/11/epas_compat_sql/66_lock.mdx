**Name**

`LOCK` -- lock a table.

**Synopsis**

```text
LOCK TABLE <name> [, ...] IN <lockmode> MODE [ NOWAIT ]
```

where `lockmode` is one of:

```
ROW SHARE | ROW EXCLUSIVE | SHARE | SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE | EXCLUSIVE
```

**Description**

`LOCK TABLE` obtains a table-level lock, waiting if necessary for any conflicting locks to be released. If `NOWAIT` is specified, `LOCK TABLE` does not wait to acquire the desired lock: if it cannot be acquired immediately, the command is aborted and an error is emitted. Once obtained, the lock is held for the remainder of the current transaction. (There is no `UNLOCK TABLE` command; locks are always released at transaction end.)

When acquiring locks automatically for commands that reference tables, Advanced Server always uses the least restrictive lock mode possible. `LOCK TABLE` provides for cases when you might need more restrictive locking. For example, suppose an application runs a transaction at the isolation level read committed and needs to ensure that data in a table remains stable for the duration of the transaction. To achieve this you could obtain `SHARE` lock mode over the table before querying. This will prevent concurrent data changes and ensure subsequent reads of the table see a stable view of committed data, because `SHARE` lock mode conflicts with the `ROW EXCLUSIVE` lock acquired by writers, and your `LOCK TABLE` name `IN SHARE MODE` statement will wait until any concurrent holders of `ROW EXCLUSIVE` mode locks commit or roll back. Thus, once you obtain the lock, there are no uncommitted writes outstanding; furthermore none can begin until you release the lock.

To achieve a similar effect when running a transaction at the isolation level serializable, you have to execute the `LOCK TABLE` statement before executing any data modification statement. A serializable transaction’s view of data will be frozen when its first data modification statement begins. A later `LOCK TABLE` will still prevent concurrent writes - but it won’t ensure that what the transaction reads corresponds to the latest committed values.

If a transaction of this sort is going to change the data in the table, then it should use `SHARE ROW EXCLUSIVE` lock mode instead of `SHARE` mode.

This ensures that only one transaction of this type runs at a time. Without this, a deadlock is possible: two transactions might both acquire `SHARE` mode, and then be unable to also acquire `ROW EXCLUSIVE` mode to actually perform their updates. (Note that a transaction’s own locks never conflict, so a transaction can acquire `ROW EXCLUSIVE` mode when it holds `SHARE` mode - but not if anyone else holds `SHARE` mode.) To avoid deadlocks, make sure all transactions acquire locks on the same objects in the same order, and if multiple lock modes are involved for a single object, then transactions should always acquire the most restrictive mode first.

**Parameters**

`name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing table to lock.

 The command `LOCK TABLE a, b;` is equivalent to `LOCK TABLE a; LOCK TABLE b`. The tables are locked one-by-one in the order specified in the `LOCK TABLE` command.

`lockmode`

 The lock mode specifies which locks this lock conflicts with.

 If no lock mode is specified, then the server uses the most restrictive mode, `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE`. (`ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` is not compatible with Oracle databases. In Advanced Server, this configuration mode ensures that no other transaction can access the locked table in any manner.)

`NOWAIT`

 Specifies that `LOCK TABLE` should not wait for any conflicting locks to be released: if the specified lock cannot be immediately acquired without waiting, the transaction is aborted.

**Notes**

All forms of `LOCK` require `UPDATE` and/or `DELETE` privileges.

`LOCK TABLE` is useful only inside a transaction block since the lock is dropped as soon as the transaction ends. A `LOCK TABLE` command appearing outside any transaction block forms a self-contained transaction, so the lock will be dropped as soon as it is obtained.

`LOCK TABLE` only deals with table-level locks, and so the mode names involving `ROW` are all misnomers. These mode names should generally be read as indicating the intention of the user to acquire row-level locks within the locked table. Also, `ROW EXCLUSIVE` mode is a sharable table lock. Keep in mind that all the lock modes have identical semantics so far as `LOCK TABLE` is concerned, differing only in the rules about which modes conflict with which.
