<div id="drop_queue_table" class="registered_link"></div>

Advanced Server includes extra syntax (not offered by Oracle) with the `DROP QUEUE TABLE SQL` command. This syntax can be used in association with `DBMS_AQADM`.

**Name**

`DROP QUEUE TABLE` -- drop a queue table.

**Synopsis**

Use `DROP QUEUE TABLE` to delete a queue table:

```text
DROP QUEUE TABLE [ IF EXISTS ] <name> [, ...]
[CASCADE | RESTRICT]
```

**Description**

`DROP QUEUE TABLE` allows a superuser or a user with the `aq_administrator_role` privilege to delete a queue table.

**Parameters**

`name`

 The name (possibly schema-qualified) of the queue table that will be deleted.

`IF EXISTS`

 Include the `IF EXISTS` clause to instruct the server to not return an error if the queue table does not exist. The server will issue a notice.

`CASCADE`

 Include the `CASCADE` keyword to automatically delete any objects that depend on the queue table.

`RESTRICT`

 Include the `RESTRICT` keyword to instruct the server to refuse to delete the queue table if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

**Examples**

The following example deletes a queue table named `work_order_table` and any objects that depend on it:

```text
DROP QUEUE TABLE work_order_table CASCADE;
```
