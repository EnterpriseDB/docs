**Parameter Type:** Integer

Specifies the maximum amount of memory to be used by maintenance operations, such as `VACUUM`, `CREATE INDEX`, and `ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY`. It defaults to 16 megabytes (`16MB`). Since only one of these operations can be executed at a time by a database session, and an installation normally doesn't have many of them running concurrently, it's safe to set this value significantly larger than `work_mem`. Larger settings might improve performance for vacuuming and for restoring database dumps.

Note that when autovacuum runs, up to `autovacuum_max_workers` times this memory may be allocated, so be careful not to set the default value too high.

A good rule of thumb is to set this to about 5% of system memory, but not more than about 512MB. Larger values won't necessarily improve performance.
