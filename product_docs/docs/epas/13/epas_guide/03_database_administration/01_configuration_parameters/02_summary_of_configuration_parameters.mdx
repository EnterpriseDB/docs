<div id="summary_of_configuration_parameters" class="registered_link"></div>

This section contains a summary table listing all Advanced Server configuration parameters along with a number of key attributes of the parameters.

These attributes are described by the following columns of the summary table:

-   **Parameter.** Configuration parameter name.

-   **Scope of Effect.** Scope of effect of the configuration parameter setting.

    -   `Cluster` – Setting affects the entire database cluster (that is, all databases managed by the database server instance).
    -   `Database` – Setting can vary by database and is established when the database is created. Applies to a small number of parameters related to locale settings.
    -   `Session` – Setting can vary down to the granularity of individual sessions.

    In other words, different settings can be made for the following entities whereby the latter settings in this list override prior ones: a) the entire database cluster, b) specific databases in the database cluster, c) specific roles, d) specific roles when connected to specific databases, e) a specific session.

-   **When Takes Effect.** When a changed parameter setting takes effect.

    -   `Preset` – Established when the Advanced Server product is built or a particular database is created. This is a read-only parameter and cannot be changed.
    -   `Restart` – Database server must be restarted.
    -   `Reload` – Configuration file must be reloaded (or the database server can be restarted).
    -   `Immediate` – Immediately effective in a session if the `PGOPTIONS` environment variable or the `SET` command is used to change the setting in the current session. Effective in new sessions if `ALTER DATABASE`, `ALTER ROLE`, or `ALTER ROLE IN DATABASE` commands are used to change the setting.

-   **Authorized User.** Type of operating system account or database role that must be used to put the parameter setting into effect.

    -   `EPAS service account` – EDB Postgres Advanced Server service account (`enterprisedb` for an installation compatible with Oracle databases, `postgres` for a PostgreSQL compatible mode installation).
    -   `Superuser` – Database role with superuser privileges.
    -   `User` – Any database role with permissions on the affected database object (the database or role to be altered with the `ALTER` command).
    -   `n/a` – Parameter setting cannot be changed by any user.

-   **Description.** Brief description of the configuration parameter.

-   **EPAS Only.** ‘X’ – Configuration parameter is applicable to EDB Postgres Advanced Server only. No entry in this column indicates the configuration parameter applies to PostgreSQL as well.

!!! Note
    There are a number of parameters that should never be altered. These are designated as “**Note: For internal use only**” in the Description column.

The following table shows the summary of configuration parameters:
