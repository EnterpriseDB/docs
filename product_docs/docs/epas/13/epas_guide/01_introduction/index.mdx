The following features have been changed in EDB Postgres Advanced Server 12 to create Advanced Server 13:

-   Advanced Server now supports the `PARALLEL` | `NOPARALLEL` clause in the `CREATE TABLE, ALTER TABLE, CREATE INDEX`, and `ALTER INDEX` commands to enable or disable parallelism on an index or a table. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's SQL Guide*.
-   Advanced Server now supports `USING INDEX ... create_index_statement` clause in the `CREATE TABLE`, and `ALTER TABLE` commands to explicitly create an index on a table. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's SQL Guide*.
-   Advanced Server introduces `AUTOMATIC LIST PARTITIONING`, which allows a database to automatically create a new partition if the partitioning key value does not correspond to an existing partition. For information, see the *Database Compatibility Table Partitioning Guide*.
-   Advanced Server has added the `STATS_MODE` function that takes an argument a set of values to return the most frequent input value. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's Reference Guide*.
-   Advanced Server has added the `SYSDATE` fuction that returns the timestamp without time zone. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's Reference Guide*.
-   Advanced Server has added `smallint, init, bigint` and `numeric` variants to the `MEDIAN` function. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's Reference Guide*.
-   Advanced Server has added support for the `FM` format in the `TO_NUMBER` function. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's Reference Guide*.
-   Advanced Server now supports statement logging and records the number of rows processed during bulk execution. For information, see `edb_log_every_bulk_value` under [Reporting and Logging / What to Log](../03_database_administration/01_configuration_parameters/03_configuration_parameters_by_functionality/06_reporting_and_logging_what_to_log/#reporting_and_logging_what_to_log).
-   Advanced Server has added a new GUC to support Oracle-style display output by setting `dbms_output.serveroutput` to `FALSE` in the `DBMS_OUTPUT` package. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's Built-in Package Guide*.
-   EDB\*Loader now supports `HANDLE_CONFLICTS` parameter to move duplicate records to the `BAD` file. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's Tools and Utilities Guide*.
-   Advanced Server has added `ALTER DIRECTORY ...OWNER TO` command to change the owner of a directory. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's SQL Guide*.
-   Advanced Server has added `ALTER TRIGGER ...ON AUTHORIZATION` command to change an owner of the trigger's implicit objects. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's SQL Guide*.
-   EDB\*Loader now supports `-c CONNECTION STRING` or `connstr=CONNECTION_STRING` parameter, which allows you to specify the SSL parameters and the connection parameters supported by libpq. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's Tools and Utilities Guide*.
-   Advanced Server has added the `TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ` function that converts a timestamp formatted string to a `TIMESTAMPTZ` datatype. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's Reference Guide*.
-   Advanced Server has added additional fields to make logs consistent across both CSV and XML audit logs. For information, see [EDB Audit Logging](../03_database_administration/05_edb_audit_logging/#edb_audit_logging).
-   Advanced Server has added a new GUC `edb_dblink_oci.rescan` to control the scan type for the remote statement. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's SQL Guide*.
-   Advanced Server has added support for `utl_http.end_of_body` exception in the `UTL_HTTP` package to handle error from `read_line, read_text`, and `read_raw` package procedures when no data is present in the response body. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's Built-in Package Guide*.
-   Advanced Server now supports the `forward declaration` of function or procedure inside a package body. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's SQL Guide*.
-   Advanced Server introduces `PARTITIONS, SUBPARTITIONS` number to create automatic hash partitions at subpartition level and `STORE IN` clause to specify the tablespaces to store the autogenerated partitions or subpartitions. For information, see the *Database Compatibility Table Partitioning Guide*.
-   Advanced Server has added support for `AES192` and `AES256` in the `DBMS_CRYPTO` package for encrypting and decrypting data types. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's Built-in Package Guide*.
-   Advanced Server now supports `pg_hba.conf` entry upon successful authentication with the server. For information, see [Modifying the pg_hba.conf File](../03_database_administration/01_configuration_parameters/01_setting_new_parameters/#modifying_the_pg_hba_conf_file).
-   Advanced Server has implemented `WHEN` condition inside `COMPOUND TRIGGER` to execute a trigger when specified conditions occur. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's SQL Guide* or *Database Compatibility Stored Procedural Language Guide*.
-   Advanced Server has added support for `column_value_long`, `define_column_long`, and `last_error_position` in the `DBMS_SQL` package to define and return a part of the `LONG` column. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developer's Built-in Package Guide*.

## Limitations

The following table describes various hard limits of PostgreSQL. However, practical limits such as performance limitations or available disk space may apply before absolute hard limits are reached.

| Item                     | Upper Limit                                                           | Comment                                                                |

!!! Note
    -   The maximum number of columns for a table is further reduced as the tuple being stored must fit in a single 8192-byte heap page. For example, excluding the tuple header, a tuple made up of 1600 `int` columns would consume 6400 bytes and could be stored in a heap page, but a tuple of 1600 `bigint` columns would consume 12800 bytes and would therefore not fit inside a heap page. Variable-length fields of types such as `text`, `varchar`, and `char` can have their values stored out of line in the table's `TOAST` table when the values are large enough to require it. Only an 18-byte pointer must remain inside the tuple in the table's heap. For shorter length variable-length fields, either a 4-byte or 1-byte field header is used and the value is stored inside the heap tuple.

    -   Columns that have been dropped from the table also contribute to the maximum column limit. Moreover, although the dropped column values for newly created tuples are internally marked as null in the tuple's null bitmap, the null bitmap also occupies space.
