<div id="index_advisor_limitations" class="registered_link"></div>

Index Advisor does not consider Index Only scans; it does consider Index scans when making recommendations.

Index Advisor ignores any computations found in the `WHERE` clause. Effectively, the index field in the recommendations will not be any kind of expression; the field will be a simple column name.

Index Advisor does not consider inheritance when recommending hypothetical indexes. If a query references a parent table, Index Advisor does not make any index recommendations on child tables.

Restoration of a `pg_dump` backup file that includes the `index_advisor_log` table or any tables for which indexing recommendations were made and stored in the `index_advisor_log` table, may result in "broken links" between the `index_advisor_log` table and the restored tables referenced by rows in the `index_advisor_log` table because of changes in object identifiers (OIDs).

If it is necessary to display the recommendations made prior to the backup, you can replace the old OIDs in the `reloid` column of the `index_advisor_log` table with the new OIDs of the referenced tables using the SQL `UPDATE` statement:

```text
UPDATE index_advisor_log SET reloid = new_oid WHERE reloid = old_oid;
```
