title: "Using %ROWTYPE With Cursors"
---

<div id="[using]()%_rowtype_with_cursors" class="registered_link"></div>


Using the `%ROWTYPE` attribute, a record can be defined that contains fields corresponding to all columns fetched from a cursor or cursor variable. Each field takes on the data type of its corresponding column. The `%ROWTYPE` attribute is prefixed by a cursor name or cursor variable name.

``` text
<record> <cursor>%ROWTYPE;
```

`record` is an identifier assigned to the record. `cursor` is an explicitly declared cursor within the current scope.

The following example shows how you can use a cursor with `%ROWTYPE` to get information about which employee works in which department.

``` text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE emp_info
IS
    CURSOR empcur IS SELECT ename, deptno FROM emp;
    myvar           empcur%ROWTYPE;
BEGIN
    OPEN empcur;
    LOOP
        FETCH empcur INTO myvar;
        EXIT WHEN empcur%NOTFOUND;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE( myvar.ename || ' works in department '
            || myvar.deptno );
    END LOOP;
    CLOSE empcur;
END;
```

The following is the output from this procedure.

``` text
EXEC emp_info;

SMITH works in department 20
ALLEN works in department 30
WARD works in department 30
JONES works in department 20
MARTIN works in department 30
BLAKE works in department 30
CLARK works in department 10
SCOTT works in department 20
KING works in department 10
TURNER works in department 30
ADAMS works in department 20
JAMES works in department 30
FORD works in department 20
MILLER works in department 10
```
