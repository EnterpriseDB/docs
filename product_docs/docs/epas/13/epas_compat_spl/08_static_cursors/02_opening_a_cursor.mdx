<div id="opening_a_cursor" class="registered_link"></div>

Before a cursor can be used to retrieve rows, it must first be opened. This is accomplished with the `OPEN` statement.

```text
OPEN <name>;
```

`name` is the identifier of a cursor that has been previously declared in the declaration section of the SPL program. The `OPEN` statement must not be executed on a cursor that has already been, and still is open.

The following shows an `OPEN` statement with its corresponding cursor declaration.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    CURSOR emp_cur_3 IS SELECT empno, ename FROM emp WHERE deptno = 10
        ORDER BY empno;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_3;
        ...
END;
```
