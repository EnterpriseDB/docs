The `%NOTFOUND` attribute is the logical opposite of `%FOUND`.

``` text
<cursor_name>%NOTFOUND
```

`cursor_name` is the name of the cursor for which a `BOOLEAN` data type of `FALSE` will be returned if a row is retrieved from the result set of the cursor after a `FETCH`.

After the last row of the result set has been fetched the next `FETCH` results in `%NOTFOUND` returning `TRUE`. `TRUE` is also returned after the first `FETCH` if there are no rows in the result set to begin with.

Referencing `%NOTFOUND` on a cursor before it is opened or after it is closed, results in an `INVALID_CURSOR` exception being thrown.

`%NOTFOUND` returns `null` if it is referenced when the cursor is open, but before the first `FETCH`.

The following example uses `%NOTFOUND`.

``` text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    v_emp_rec       emp%ROWTYPE;
    CURSOR emp_cur_1 IS SELECT * FROM emp;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_1;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('EMPNO    ENAME');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('-----    -------');
    LOOP
        FETCH emp_cur_1 INTO v_emp_rec;
        EXIT WHEN emp_cur_1%NOTFOUND;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_emp_rec.empno || '     ' || v_emp_rec.ename);
    END LOOP;
    CLOSE emp_cur_1;
END;
```

Similar to the prior example, this procedure produces the same output when invoked.

``` text
EXEC cursor_example;
