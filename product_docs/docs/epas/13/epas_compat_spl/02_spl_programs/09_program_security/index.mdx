Security over what user may execute an SPL program and what database objects an SPL program may access for any given user executing the program is controlled by the following:

-   Privilege to execute a program.
-   Privileges granted on the database objects (including other SPL programs) which a program attempts to access.
-   Whether the program is defined with definer’s rights or invoker’s rights.

These aspects are discussed in the following sections.
