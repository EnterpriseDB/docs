Functions are standalone SPL programs that are invoked as expressions. When evaluated, a function returns a value that is substituted in the expression in which the function is embedded. Functions may optionally take values from the calling program in the form of input parameters. In addition to the fact that the function, itself, returns a value, a function may optionally return additional values to the caller in the form of output parameters. The use of output parameters in functions, however, is not an encouraged programming practice.
