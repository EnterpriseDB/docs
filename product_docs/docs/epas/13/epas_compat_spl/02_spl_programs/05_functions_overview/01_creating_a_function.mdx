<div id="creating_a_function" class="registered_link"></div>

The `CREATE FUNCTION` command defines and names a standalone function that will be stored in the database.

If a schema name is included, then the function is created in the specified schema. Otherwise it is created in the current schema. The name of the new function must not match any existing function with the same input argument types in the same schema. However, functions of different input argument types may share a name (this is called *overloading*). (Overloading of functions is an Advanced Server feature - overloading of stored, standalone functions is not compatible with Oracle databases).

To update the definition of an existing function, use `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION`. It is not possible to change the name or argument types of a function this way (if you tried, you would actually be creating a new, distinct function). Also, `CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION` will not let you change the return type of an existing function. To do that, you must drop and recreate the function. Also when using `OUT` parameters, you cannot change the types of any `OUT` parameters except by dropping the function.

   ...]

    [ PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION; ]
    [ <declarations> ]
  BEGIN
    <statements>
  END [ <name> ];
```

**Where:**

`name`

 `name` is the identifier of the function.

`parameters`

 `parameters` is a list of formal parameters.

`data_type`

 `data_type` is the data type of the value returned by the functionâ€™s `RETURN` statement.

`declarations`

 `declarations` are variable, cursor, type, or subprogram declarations. If subprogram declarations are included, they must be declared after all other variable, cursor, and type declarations.

`statements`

 `statements` are SPL program statements (the `BEGIN - END` block may contain an `EXCEPTION` section).

`IMMUTABLE`

`STABLE`

`VOLATILE`

 These attributes inform the query optimizer about the behavior of the function; you can specify only one choice. `VOLATILE` is the default behavior.

-   `IMMUTABLE` indicates that the function cannot modify the database and always reaches the same result when given the same argument values; it does not do database lookups or otherwise use information not directly present in its argument list. If you include this clause, any call of the function with all-constant arguments can be immediately replaced with the function value.

-   `STABLE` indicates that the function cannot modify the database, and that within a single table scan, it will consistently return the same result for the same argument values, but that its result could change across SQL statements. This is the appropriate selection for function that depend on database lookups, parameter variables (such as the current time zone), etc.

-   `VOLATILE` indicates that the function value can change even within a single table scan, so no optimizations can be made. Please note that any function that has side-effects must be classified volatile, even if its result is quite predictable, to prevent calls from being optimized away.

`DETERMINISTIC`

 `DETERMINISTIC` is a synonym for `IMMUTABLE`. A `DETERMINISTIC` function cannot modify the database and always reaches the same result when given the same argument values; it does not do database lookups or otherwise use information not directly present in its argument list. If you include this clause, any call of the function with all-constant arguments can be immediately replaced with the function value.

`[ NOT ] LEAKPROOF`

 A `LEAKPROOF` function has no side effects, and reveals no information about the values used to call the function.

`CALLED ON NULL INPUT`

`RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT`

`STRICT`

-   `CALLED ON NULL INPUT` (the default) indicates that the procedure will be called normally when some of its arguments are `NULL`. It is the author's responsibility to check for `NULL` values if necessary and respond appropriately.

-   `RETURNS NULL ON NULL INPUT` or `STRICT` indicates that the procedure always returns `NULL` whenever any of its arguments are `NULL`. If these clauses are specified, the procedure is not executed when there are `NULL` arguments; instead a `NULL` result is assumed automatically.

`[ EXTERNAL ] SECURITY DEFINER`

 `SECURITY DEFINER` specifies that the function will execute with the privileges of the user that created it; this is the default. The key word `EXTERNAL` is allowed for SQL conformance, but is optional.

`[ EXTERNAL ] SECURITY INVOKER`

 The `SECURITY INVOKER` clause indicates that the function will execute with the privileges of the user that calls it. The key word `EXTERNAL` is allowed for SQL conformance, but is optional.

`AUTHID DEFINER`

`AUTHID CURRENT_USER`

-   The `AUTHID DEFINER` clause is a synonym for `[EXTERNAL] SECURITY DEFINER`. If the `AUTHID` clause is omitted or if `AUTHID DEFINER` is specified, the rights of the function owner are used to determine access privileges to database objects.

-   The `AUTHID CURRENT_USER` clause is a synonym for `[EXTERNAL] SECURITY INVOKER`. If `AUTHID CURRENT_USER` is specified, the rights of the current user executing the function are used to determine access privileges.

`PARALLEL { UNSAFE | RESTRICTED | SAFE }`

 The `PARALLEL` clause enables the use of parallel sequential scans (parallel mode). A parallel sequential scan uses multiple workers to scan a relation in parallel during a query in contrast to a serial sequential scan.

-   When set to `UNSAFE`, the function cannot be executed in parallel mode. The presence of such a function in a SQL statement forces a serial execution plan. This is the default setting if the `PARALLEL` clause is omitted.

-   When set to `RESTRICTED`, the function can be executed in parallel mode, but the execution is restricted to the parallel group leader. If the qualification for any particular relation has anything that is parallel restricted, that relation won't be chosen for parallelism.

-   When set to `SAFE`, the function can be executed in parallel mode with no restriction.

`COST execution_cost`

 `execution_cost` is a positive number giving the estimated execution cost for the function, in units of `cpu_operator_cost`. If the function returns a set, this is the cost per returned row. Larger values cause the planner to try to avoid evaluating the function more often than necessary.

`ROWS result_rows`

 `result_rows` is a positive number giving the estimated number of rows that the planner should expect the function to return. This is only allowed when the function is declared to return a set. The default assumption is 1000 rows.

`SET configuration_parameter { TO value | = value | FROM CURRENT }`

 The `SET` clause causes the specified configuration parameter to be set to the specified value when the function is entered, and then restored to its prior value when the function exits. `SET FROM CURRENT` saves the session's current value of the parameter as the value to be applied when the function is entered.

 If a `SET` clause is attached to a function, then the effects of a `SET LOCAL` command executed inside the function for the same variable are restricted to the function; the configuration parameter's prior value is restored at function exit. An ordinary `SET` command (without `LOCAL`) overrides the `SET` clause, much as it would do for a previous `SET LOCAL` command, with the effects of such a command persisting after procedure exit, unless the current transaction is rolled back.

`PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION`

 `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` is the directive that sets the function as an autonomous transaction.

!!! Note
    The `STRICT, LEAKPROOF, PARALLEL, COST, ROWS` and `SET` keywords provide extended functionality for Advanced Server and are not supported by Oracle.

**Examples**

The following is an example of a simple function that takes no parameters.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION simple_function
    RETURN VARCHAR2
IS
BEGIN
    RETURN 'That''s All Folks!';
END simple_function;
```

The following function takes two input parameters. Parameters are discussed in more detail in subsequent sections.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION emp_comp (
    p_sal           NUMBER,
    p_comm          NUMBER
) RETURN NUMBER
IS
BEGIN
    RETURN (p_sal + NVL(p_comm, 0)) * 24;
END emp_comp;
```

The following example demonstrates using the `AUTHID CURRENT_USER` clause and `STRICT` keyword in a function declaration:

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION dept_salaries(dept_id int) RETURN NUMBER
  STRICT
  AUTHID CURRENT_USER
BEGIN
  RETURN QUERY (SELECT sum(salary) FROM emp WHERE deptno = id);
END;
```

Include the `STRICT` keyword to instruct the server to return `NULL` if any input parameter passed is `NULL`; if a `NULL` value is passed, the function will not execute.

The `dept_salaries` function executes with the privileges of the role that is calling the function. If the current user does not have sufficient privileges to perform the `SELECT` statement querying the `emp` table (to display employee salaries), the function will report an error. To instruct the server to use the privileges associated with the role that defined the function, replace the `AUTHID CURRENT_USER` clause with the `AUTHID DEFINER` clause.
