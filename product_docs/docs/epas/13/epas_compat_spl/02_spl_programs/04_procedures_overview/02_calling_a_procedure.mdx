title: "Calling a Procedure"

<div id="calling_a_procedure" class="registered_link"></div>

A procedure can be invoked from another SPL program by simply specifying the procedure name followed by its parameters, if any, followed by a semicolon.

```text
<name> [ ([ <parameters> ]) ];
```

**Where:**

`name` is the identifier of the procedure.

`parameters` is a list of actual parameters.

!!! Note
    -   If there are no actual parameters to be passed, the procedure may be called with an empty parameter list, or the opening and closing parenthesis may be omitted entirely.

    -   The syntax for calling a procedure is the same as in the preceding syntax diagram when executing it with the `EXEC` command in PSQL or EDB\*Plus. See the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Tools and Utilities Guide* for information about the `EXEC` command.

The following is an example of calling the procedure from an anonymous block:

```text
BEGIN
   simple_procedure;
END;

That's all folks!
```

!!! Note
    Each application has its own unique way to call a procedure. For example, in a Java application, the application programming interface, JDBC, is used.
