This section describes the terminology of the relationship between blocks that can be declared in an SPL program. The ability to invoke subprograms and access identifiers declared within a block depends upon this relationship.

The following are the basic terms:

-   A *block* is the basic SPL structure consisting of an optional declaration section, a mandatory executable section, and an optional exception section. Blocks implement standalone procedure and function programs, anonymous blocks, triggers, packages, and subprocedures and subfunctions.
-   An identifier (variable, cursor, type, or subprogram) *local to a block* means that it is declared within the declaration section of the given block. Such local identifiers are accessible from the executable section and optional exception section of the block.
-   The *parent block* contains the declaration of another block (the *child block*).
-   *Descendent blocks* are the set of blocks forming the child relationship starting from a given parent block.
-   *Ancestor blocks* are the set of blocks forming the parental relationship starting from a given child block.
-   The set of descendent (or ancestor) blocks form a *hierarchy*.
-   The *level* is an ordinal number of a given block from the highest, ancestor block. For example, given a standalone procedure, the subprograms declared within the declaration section of this procedure are all at the same level, for example call it level 1. Additional subprograms within the declaration section of the subprograms declared in the standalone procedure are at the next level, which is level 2.
-   The *sibling blocks* are the set of blocks that have the same parent block (that is, they are all locally declared in the same block). Sibling blocks are also always at the same level relative to each other.

The following schematic of a set of procedure declaration sections provides an example of a set of blocks and their relationships to their surrounding blocks.

The two vertical lines on the left-hand side of the blocks indicate there are two pairs of sibling blocks. `block_1a` and `block_1b` is one pair, and `block_2a` and `block_2b` is the second pair.

The relationship of each block with its ancestors is shown on the right-hand side of the blocks. There are three hierarchical paths formed when progressing up the hierarchy from the lowest level child blocks. The first consists of `block_0, block_1a, block_2a`, and `block_3`. The second is `block_0, block_1a`, and `block_2b`. The third is `block_0, block_1b`, and `block_2b`.

The rules for invoking subprograms based upon block location is described starting with [Invoking Subprograms](04_invoking_subprograms/#invoking_subprograms). The rules for accessing variables based upon block location is described in [Accessing Subprogram Variables](07_accessing_subprogram_variables/#accessing_subprogram_variables).
