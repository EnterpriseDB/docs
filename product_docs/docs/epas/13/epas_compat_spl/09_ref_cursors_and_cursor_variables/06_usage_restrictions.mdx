The following are restrictions on cursor variable usage.

-   Comparison operators cannot be used to test cursor variables for equality, inequality, null, or not null
-   Null cannot be assigned to a cursor variable
-   The value of a cursor variable cannot be stored in a database column
-   Static cursors and cursor variables are not interchangeable. For example, a static cursor cannot be used in an `OPEN FOR` statement.

In addition the following table shows the permitted parameter modes for a cursor variable used as a procedure or function parameter depending upon the operations on the cursor variable within the procedure or function.

| Operation | IN    | IN OUT | OUT  |
| --------- | ----- | ------ | ---- |
| `OPEN`    | `No`  | `Yes`  | `No` |
| `FETCH`   | `Yes` | `Yes`  | `No` |
| `CLOSE`   | `Yes` | `Yes`  | `No` |

So for example, if a procedure performs all three operations, `OPEN FOR, FETCH`, and `CLOSE` on a cursor variable declared as the procedureâ€™s formal parameter, then that parameter must be declared with `IN OUT` mode.
