<div id="trigger_variables" class="registered_link"></div>

In the trigger code block, several special variables are available for use.

`NEW`

 `NEW` is a pseudo-record name that refers to the new table row for insert and update operations in row-level triggers. This variable is not applicable in statement-level triggers and in delete operations of row-level triggers.

 Its usage is: `:NEW.column` where `column` is the name of a column in the table on which the trigger is defined.

 The initial content of `:NEW.column` is the value in the named column of the new row to be inserted or of the new row that is to replace the old one when used in a before row-level trigger. When used in an after row-level trigger, this value has already been stored in the table since the action has already occurred on the affected row.

 In the trigger code block, `:NEW.column` can be used like any other variable. If a value is assigned to `:NEW.column`, in the code block of a before row-level trigger, the assigned value will be used in the new inserted or updated row.

`OLD`

 `OLD` is a pseudo-record name that refers to the old table row for update and delete operations in row-level triggers. This variable is not applicable in statement-level triggers and in insert operations of row-level triggers.

 Its usage is: `:OLD.column` where `column` is the name of a column in the table on which the trigger is defined.

 The initial content of `:OLD.column` is the value in the named column of the row to be deleted or of the old row that is to be replaced by the new one when used in a before row-level trigger. When used in an after row-level trigger, this value is no longer stored in the table since the action has already occurred on the affected row.

 In the trigger code block, `:OLD.column` can be used like any other variable. Assigning a value to `:OLD.column`, has no effect on the action of the trigger.

`INSERTING`

 `INSERTING` is a conditional expression that returns `TRUE` if an insert operation fired the trigger, otherwise it returns `FALSE`.

`UPDATING`

 `UPDATING` is a conditional expression that returns `TRUE` if an update operation fired the trigger, otherwise it returns `FALSE`.

`DELETING`

 `DELETING` is a conditional expression that returns `TRUE` if a delete operation fired the trigger, otherwise it returns `FALSE`.
