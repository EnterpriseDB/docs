WHILE <expression> LOOP
    <statements>
END LOOP;
```

The `WHILE` statement repeats a sequence of statements so long as the condition expression evaluates to `TRUE`. The condition is checked just before each entry to the loop body.

The following example contains the same logic as in the previous example except the `WHILE` statement is used to take the place of the `EXIT` statement to determine when to exit the loop.

Note

</div>

The conditional expression used to determine when to exit the loop must be altered. The `EXIT` statement terminates the loop when its conditional expression is true. The `WHILE` statement terminates (or never begins the loop) when its conditional expression is false.

DECLARE
    v_counter       NUMBER(2);
BEGIN
    v_counter := 1;
    WHILE v_counter <= 10 LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Iteration # ' || v_counter);
        v_counter := v_counter + 1;
    END LOOP;
END;
```

The same result is generated by this example as in the prior example.
