```text
EXIT [ WHEN <expression> ];
```

The innermost loop is terminated and the statement following `END LOOP` is executed next.

If `WHEN` is present, loop exit occurs only if the specified condition is `TRUE`, otherwise control passes to the statement after `EXIT`.

`EXIT` can be used to cause early exit from all types of loops; it is not limited to use with unconditional loops.

The following is a simple example of a loop that iterates ten times and then uses the `EXIT` statement to terminate.

```text
DECLARE
    v_counter       NUMBER(2);
BEGIN
    v_counter := 1;
    LOOP
        EXIT WHEN v_counter > 10;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Iteration # ' || v_counter);
        v_counter := v_counter + 1;
    END LOOP;
END;
```

The following is the output from this program.

```text
Iteration # 1
Iteration # 2
Iteration # 3
Iteration # 4
Iteration # 5
Iteration # 6
Iteration # 7
Iteration # 8
Iteration # 9
Iteration # 10
```
