title: "Exception Handling"

<div id="exception_handling" class="registered_link"></div>

By default, any error occurring in an SPL program aborts execution of the program. You can trap errors and recover from them by using a `BEGIN` block with an `EXCEPTION` section. The syntax is an extension of the normal syntax for a `BEGIN` block:

```text
[ DECLARE
    <declarations> ]
  BEGIN
    <statements>
  EXCEPTION
    WHEN <condition> [ OR <condition> ]... THEN
      <handler_statements>
  [ WHEN <condition> [ OR <condition> ]... THEN
      <handler_statements> ]...
END;
```

If no error occurs, this form of block simply executes all the `statements`, and then control passes to the next statement after `END`. If an error occurs within the `statements`, further processing of the `statements` is abandoned, and control passes to the `EXCEPTION` list. The list is searched for the first `condition` matching the error that occurred. If a match is found, the corresponding `handler_statements` are executed, and then control passes to the next statement after `END`. If no match is found, the error propagates out as though the `EXCEPTION` clause were not there at all. The error can be caught by an enclosing block with `EXCEPTION`; if there is no enclosing block, it aborts processing of the subprogram.

The special condition name `OTHERS` matches every error type. Condition names are not case-sensitive.

If a new error occurs within the selected `handler_statements`, it cannot be caught by this `EXCEPTION` clause, but is propagated out. A surrounding `EXCEPTION` clause could catch it.

The following table lists the condition names that may be used:

<table><tbody><tr class="odd"><td>Condition Name</td><td><blockquote><p>Description</p></blockquote></td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>CASE_NOT_FOUND</code></td><td><blockquote><p>The application has encountered a situation where none of the cases in a <code>CASE</code> statement evaluates to <code>TRUE</code> and there is no <code>ELSE</code> condition.</p></blockquote></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>COLLECTION_IS_NULL</code></td><td><blockquote><p>The application has attempted to invoke a collection method on a null collection such as an uninitialized nested table.</p></blockquote></td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>CURSOR_ALREADY_OPEN</code></td><td><blockquote><p>The application has attempted to open a cursor that is already open.</p></blockquote></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX</code></td><td><blockquote><p>The application has attempted to store a duplicate value that currently exists within a constrained column.</p></blockquote></td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>INVALID_CURSOR</code></td><td><blockquote><p>The application has attempted to access an unopened cursor.</p></blockquote></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>INVALID_NUMBER</code></td><td><blockquote><p>The application has encountered a data exception (equivalent to SQLSTATE class code 22). <code>INVALID_NUMBER</code> is an alias for <code>VALUE_ERROR</code>.</p></blockquote></td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>NO_DATA_FOUND</code></td><td><blockquote><p>No rows satisfy the selection criteria.</p></blockquote></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>OTHERS</code></td><td><blockquote><p>The application has encountered an exception that hasnâ€™t been caught by a prior condition in the exception section.</p></blockquote></td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>SUBSCRIPT_BEYOND_COUNT</code></td><td><blockquote><p>The application has attempted to reference a subscript of a nested table or varray beyond its initialized or extended size.</p></blockquote></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>SUBSCRIPT_OUTSIDE_LIMIT</code></td><td><blockquote><p>The application has attempted to reference a subscript or extend a varray beyond its maximum size limit.</p></blockquote></td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>TOO_MANY_ROWS</code></td><td><blockquote><p>The application has encountered more than one row that satisfies the selection criteria (where only one row is allowed to be returned).</p></blockquote></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>VALUE_ERROR</code></td><td><blockquote><p>The application has encountered a data exception (equivalent to SQLSTATE class code 22). <code>VALUE_ERROR</code> is an alias for <code>INVALID_NUMBER</code>.</p></blockquote></td></tr><tr class="even"><td><code>ZERO_DIVIDE</code></td><td><blockquote><p>The application has tried to divide by zero.</p></blockquote></td></tr><tr class="odd"><td><code>User-defined Exception</code></td><td><blockquote><p>See <a href="08_user_defined_exceptions/#user_defined_exceptions">User-defined Exceptions</a>.</p></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table>

Condition names `INVALID_NUMBER` and `VALUE_ERROR` are not compatible with Oracle databases for which these condition names are for exceptions resulting only from a failed conversion of a string to a numeric literal. In addition, for Oracle databases, an `INVALID_NUMBER` exception is applicable only to SQL statements while a `VALUE_ERROR` exception is applicable only to procedural statements.
