`LIMIT` is a method that returns the maximum number of elements permitted in a collection. `LIMIT` is applicable only to varrays. The syntax for using `LIMIT` is as follows:

``` text
<collection>.LIMIT
```

`collection` is the name of a collection.

For an initialized varray, `LIMIT` returns the maximum size limit determined by the varray type definition. If the varray is uninitialized (that is, it is a null varray), an exception is thrown.

For an associative array or an initialized nested table, `LIMIT` returns `NULL`. If the nested table is uninitialized (that is, it is a null nested table), an exception is thrown.
