<div id="attributes" class="registered_link"></div>

Every object type must contain at least one attribute. The data type of an attribute can be any of the following:

-   A base data type such as `NUMBER, VARCHAR2`, etc.
-   Another object type
-   A globally defined collection type (created by the `CREATE TYPE` command) such as a nested table or varray

An attribute gets its initial value (which may be null) when an object instance is initially created. Each object instance has its own set of attribute values.
