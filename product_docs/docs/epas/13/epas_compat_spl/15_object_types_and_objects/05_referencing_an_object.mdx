Once an object variable is created and initialized, individual attributes can be referenced using dot notation of the form:

``` text
<object.attribute>
```

`object` is the identifier assigned to the object variable. `attribute` is the identifier of an object type attribute.

If `attribute`, itself, is of an object type, then the reference must take the form:

``` text
<object.attribute.attribute_inner>
```

`attribute_inner` is an identifier belonging to the object type to which `attribute` references in its definition of `object`.

The following example expands upon the previous anonymous block to display the values assigned to the `emp_obj_typ` object.

``` text
DECLARE
    v_emp          EMP_OBJ_TYP;
BEGIN
    v_emp := emp_obj_typ(9001,'JONES',
        addr_obj_typ('123 MAIN STREET','EDISON','NJ',08817));
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee No   : ' || v_emp.empno);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Name          : ' || v_emp.ename);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Street        : ' || v_emp.addr.street);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('City/State/Zip: ' || v_emp.addr.city || ', ' ||
        v_emp.addr.state || ' ' || LPAD(v_emp.addr.zip,5,'0'));
END;
```

The following is the output from this anonymous block.

``` text
Employee No   : 9001
Name          : JONES
Street        : 123 MAIN STREET
City/State/Zip: EDISON, NJ 08817
```

Methods are called in a similar manner as attributes.

Once an object variable is created and initialized, member procedures or functions are called using dot notation of the form:

``` text
<object.prog_name>
```

`object` is the identifier assigned to the object variable. `prog_name` is the identifier of the procedure or function.

Static procedures or functions are not called utilizing an object variable. Instead the procedure or function is called utilizing the object type name:

``` text
<object_type.prog_name>
```

`object_type` is the identifier assigned to the object type. `prog_name` is the identifier of the procedure or function.

The results of the previous anonymous block can be duplicated by calling the member procedure `display_emp:`

``` text
DECLARE
    v_emp          EMP_OBJ_TYP;
BEGIN
    v_emp := emp_obj_typ(9001,'JONES',
        addr_obj_typ('123 MAIN STREET','EDISON','NJ',08817));
    v_emp.display_emp;
END;
```

The following is the output from this anonymous block.

``` text
Employee No   : 9001
Name          : JONES
Street        : 123 MAIN STREET
City/State/Zip: EDISON, NJ 08817
```

The following anonymous block creates an instance of `dept_obj_typ` and calls the member procedure `display_dept:`

``` text
DECLARE
    v_dept          DEPT_OBJ_TYP := dept_obj_typ (20);
BEGIN
    v_dept.display_dept;
END;
```

The following is the output from this anonymous block.

``` text
Dept No    : 20
Dept Name  : RESEARCH
```

The static function defined in `dept_obj_typ` can be called directly by qualifying it by the object type name as follows:

``` text
BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(dept_obj_typ.get_dname(20));
END;

RESEARCH
```
