The following is the syntax of the object type body:

``` text
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] TYPE BODY <name>
  { IS | AS }
  <method_spec> [...]
  [<constructor>] [...]
END;
```

where `method_spec` is the following:

> `subprogram_spec`

and `subprogram_spec` is the following:

``` text
{ MEMBER | STATIC }
{ PROCEDURE <proc_name>
    [ ( [  SELF [ IN | IN OUT ] <name> ]
        [, parm1 [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] datatype1
                 [ DEFAULT value1 ] ]
        [, parm2 [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] datatype2
                 [ DEFAULT value2 ]
        ] ...)
    ]
{ IS | AS }
  [ PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION; ]
  [ <declarations> ]
  BEGIN
    <statement>; ...
[ EXCEPTION
    WHEN ... THEN
      <statement>; ...]
  END;
|
  FUNCTION <func_name>
    [ ( [  SELF [ IN | IN OUT ] <name> ]
        [, parm1 [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] datatype1
                 [ DEFAULT value1 ] ]
        [, parm2 [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] datatype2
                 [ DEFAULT value2 ]
        ] ...)
    ]
  RETURN <return_type>
{ IS | AS }
  [ PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION; ]
  [ <declarations> ]
  BEGIN
    <statement>; ...
[ EXCEPTION
    WHEN ... THEN
      <statement>; ...]
  END;
```

where `constructor` is:

``` text
CONSTRUCTOR <func_name>
  [ ( [  SELF [ IN | IN OUT ] <name> ]
      [, parm1 [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] datatype1
               [ DEFAULT value1 ] ]
      [, parm2 [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] datatype2
               [ DEFAULT value2 ]
      ] ...)
  ]
RETURN self AS RESULT
{ IS | AS }
[ <declarations> ]
BEGIN
  <statement>; ...
[ EXCEPTION
  WHEN ... THEN
    <statement>; ...]
END;
```

`name` is an identifier (optionally schema-qualified) assigned to the object type.

`method_spec` denotes the implementation of an instantiable method that was specified in the `CREATE TYPE` command.

If `INSTANTIABLE` was specified or omitted in `method_spec` of the `CREATE TYPE` command, then there must be a `method_spec` for this method in the `CREATE TYPE BODY` command.

If `NOT INSTANTIABLE` was specified in `method_spec` of the `CREATE TYPE` command, then there must be no `method_spec` for this method in the `CREATE TYPE BODY` command.

`subprogram_spec` denotes the specification of a procedure or function and begins with the specification of either `MEMBER` or `STATIC`. The same qualifier must be used as was specified in `subprogram_spec` of the `CREATE TYPE` command.

`proc_name` is an identifier of a procedure specified in the `CREATE TYPE` command. The parameter declarations have the same meaning as described for the `CREATE TYPE` command, and must be specified in the `CREATE TYPE BODY` command in the same manner as specified in the `CREATE TYPE` command.

Include the `CONSTRUCTOR` keyword and function definition to define a constructor function.

`func_name` is an identifier of a function specified in the `CREATE TYPE` command. The parameter declarations have the same meaning as described for the `CREATE TYPE` command, and must be specified in the `CREATE TYPE BODY` command in the same manner as specified in the `CREATE TYPE` command. `return_type` is the data type of the value the function returns and must match `return_type` given in the `CREATE TYPE` command.

`PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` is the directive that sets the procedure or function as an autonomous transaction.

`declarations` are variable, cursor, type, or subprogram declarations. If subprogram declarations are included, they must be declared after all other variable, cursor, and type declarations.

`statement` is an SPL program statement.
