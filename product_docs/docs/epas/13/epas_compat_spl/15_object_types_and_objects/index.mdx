This chapter discusses how object-oriented programming techniques can be exploited in SPL. Object-oriented programming as seen in programming languages such as Java and C++ centers on the concept of objects. An *object* is a representation of a real-world entity such as a person, place, or thing. The generic description or definition of a particular object such as a person for example, is called an *object type*. Specific people such as “Joe” or “Sally” are said to be *objects of object type*, person, or equivalently, *instances* of the object type, person, or simply, person objects.

!!! Note
    -   The terms “database objects” and “objects” that have been used in this document up to this point should not be confused with an object type and object as used in this chapter. The previous usage of these terms relates to the entities that can be created in a database such as tables, views, indexes, users, etc. Within the context of this chapter, object type and object refer to specific data structures supported by the SPL programming language to implement object-oriented concepts.

    -   In Oracle, the term *abstract data type* (ADT) is used to describe object types in PL/SQL. The SPL implementation of object types is intended to be compatible with Oracle abstract data types.

    -   Advanced Server has not yet implemented support for some features of object-oriented programming languages. This chapter documents only those features that have been implemented.
