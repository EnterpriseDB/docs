A constructor method is a function that creates an instance of an object type, typically by assigning values to the members of the object. An object type may define several constructors to accomplish different tasks. A constructor method is a member function (invoked with a `SELF` parameter) whose name matches the name of the type.

For example, if you define a type named `address`, each constructor is named `address`. You may overload a constructor by creating one or more different constructor functions with the same name, but with different argument types.

The SPL compiler will provide a default constructor for each object type. The default constructor is a member function whose name matches the name of the type and whose argument list matches the type members (in order). For example, given an object type such as:

```text
CREATE TYPE address AS OBJECT
(
  street_address VARCHAR2(40),
  postal_code    VARCHAR2(10),
  city           VARCHAR2(40),
  state          VARCHAR2(2)
)
```

The SPL compiler will provide a default constructor with the following signature:

```text
CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION address
(
  street_address VARCHAR2(40),
  postal_code    VARCHAR2(10),
  city           VARCHAR2(40),
  state          VARCHAR2(2)
)
```

The body of the default constructor simply sets each member to `NULL`.

To create a custom constructor, declare the constructor function (using the keyword constructor) in the `CREATE TYPE` command and define the construction function in the `CREATE TYPE BODY` command. For example, you may wish to create a custom constructor for the `address` type which computes the city and state given a `street_address` and `postal_code:`

```text
CREATE TYPE address AS OBJECT
(
  street_address VARCHAR2(40),
  postal_code    VARCHAR2(10),
  city           VARCHAR2(40),
  state          VARCHAR2(2),

  CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION address
   (
     street_address VARCHAR2,
     postal_code VARCHAR2
    ) RETURN self AS RESULT
)
CREATE TYPE BODY address AS
 CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION address
  (
    street_address VARCHAR2,
    postal_code VARCHAR2
   ) RETURN self AS RESULT
 IS
   BEGIN
     self.street_address := street_address;
     self.postal_code := postal_code;
     self.city := postal_code_to_city(postal_code);
     self.state := postal_code_to_state(postal_code);
     RETURN;
   END;
END;
```

To create an instance of an object type, you invoke one of the constructor methods for that type. For example:

```text
DECLARE
  cust_addr address := address('100 Main Street', 02203');
BEGIN
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(cust_addr.city);  -- displays Boston
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(cust_addr.state); -- displays MA
END;
```

Custom constructor functions are typically used to compute member values when given incomplete information. The preceding example computes the values for `city` and `state` when given a postal code.

Custom constructor functions are also used to enforce business rules that restrict the state of an object. For example, if you define an object type to represent a `payment`, you can use a custom constructor to ensure that no object of type `payment` can be created with an `amount` that is `NULL`, negative, or zero. The default constructor would set `payment.amount` to `NULL` so you must create a custom constructor (whose signature matches the default constructor) to prohibit `NULL` amounts.
