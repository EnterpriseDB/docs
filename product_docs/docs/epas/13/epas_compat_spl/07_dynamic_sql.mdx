*Dynamic SQL* is a technique that provides the ability to execute SQL commands that are not known until the commands are about to be executed. Up to this point, the SQL commands that have been illustrated in SPL programs have been static SQL - the full command (with the exception of variables) must be known and coded into the program before the program, itself, can begin to execute. Thus using dynamic SQL, the executed SQL can change during program runtime.

In addition, dynamic SQL is the only method by which data definition commands, such as `CREATE TABLE`, can be executed from within an SPL program.

Note, however, that the runtime performance of dynamic SQL will be slower than static SQL.

The `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` command is used to run SQL commands dynamically.

``` text
EXECUTE IMMEDIATE '<sql_expression>;'
  [ INTO { <variable> [, ...] | <record> } ]
  [ USING <expression> [, ...] ]
```

`sql_expression` is a string expression containing the SQL command to be dynamically executed. `variable` receives the output of the result set, typically from a `SELECT` command, created as a result of executing the SQL command in `sql_expression`. The number, order, and type of variables must match the number, order, and be type-compatible with the fields of the result set. Alternatively, a `record` can be specified as long as the record’s fields match the number, order, and are type-compatible with the result set. When using the `INTO` clause, exactly one row must be returned in the result set, otherwise an exception occurs. When using the `USING` clause the value of `expression` is passed to a *placeholder*. Placeholders appear embedded within the SQL command in `sql_expression` where variables may be used. Placeholders are denoted by an identifier with a colon (:) prefix - `:name`. The number, order, and resultant data types of the evaluated expressions must match the number, order and be type-compatible with the placeholders in `sql_expression`. Note that placeholders are not declared anywhere in the SPL program – they only appear in `sql_expression`.

The following example shows basic dynamic SQL commands as string literals.

``` text
DECLARE
    v_sql           VARCHAR2(50);
BEGIN
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'CREATE TABLE job (jobno NUMBER(3),' ||
        ' jname VARCHAR2(9))';
    v_sql := 'INSERT INTO job VALUES (100, ''ANALYST'')';
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql;
    v_sql := 'INSERT INTO job VALUES (200, ''CLERK'')';
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql;
END;
```

The following example illustrates the `USING` clause to pass values to placeholders in the SQL string.

``` text
DECLARE
    v_sql           VARCHAR2(50) := 'INSERT INTO job VALUES ' ||
                        '(:p_jobno, :p_jname)';
    v_jobno         job.jobno%TYPE;
    v_jname         job.jname%TYPE;
BEGIN
    v_jobno := 300;
    v_jname := 'MANAGER';
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql USING v_jobno, v_jname;
    v_jobno := 400;
    v_jname := 'SALESMAN';
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql USING v_jobno, v_jname;
    v_jobno := 500;
    v_jname := 'PRESIDENT';
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql USING v_jobno, v_jname;
END;
```

The following example shows both the `INTO` and `USING` clauses. Note the last execution of the `SELECT` command returns the results into a record instead of individual variables.

``` text
DECLARE
    v_sql           VARCHAR2(60);
    v_jobno         job.jobno%TYPE;
    v_jname         job.jname%TYPE;
    r_job           job%ROWTYPE;
BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('JOBNO    JNAME');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('-----    -------');
    v_sql := 'SELECT jobno, jname FROM job WHERE jobno = :p_jobno';
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql INTO v_jobno, v_jname USING 100;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_jobno || '      ' || v_jname);
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql INTO v_jobno, v_jname USING 200;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_jobno || '      ' || v_jname);
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql INTO v_jobno, v_jname USING 300;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_jobno || '      ' || v_jname);
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql INTO v_jobno, v_jname USING 400;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_jobno || '      ' || v_jname);
    EXECUTE IMMEDIATE v_sql INTO r_job USING 500;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(r_job.jobno || '      ' || r_job.jname);
END;
```

The following is the output from the previous anonymous block:

``` text
JOBNO    JNAME
-----    -------
100      ANALYST
200      CLERK
300      MANAGER
400      SALESMAN
500      PRESIDENT
```

You can use the `BULK COLLECT` clause to assemble the result set from an `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` statement into a named collection. See [Using the BULK COLLECT Clause](12_working_with_collections/04_using_the_bulk_collect_clause/#using_the_bulk_collect_clause), `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE BULK COLLECT` for information about using the `BULK COLLECT` clause.
