Use the `ALTER TABLE… DROP PARTITION` command to delete a partition definition, and the data stored in that partition. The syntax is:

```text
ALTER TABLE <table_name> DROP PARTITION <partition_name>;
```

**Parameters**

`table_name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the partitioned table.

`partition_name`

 The name of the partition to be deleted.

**Description**

The `ALTER TABLE… DROP PARTITION` command deletes a partition and any data stored on that partition. The `ALTER TABLE… DROP PARTITION` command can drop partitions of a `LIST` or `RANGE` partitioned table; please note that this command does not work on a `HASH` partitioned table. When you delete a partition, any subpartitions (of that partition) are deleted as well.

To use the `DROP PARTITION` clause, you must be the owner of the partitioning root, a member of a group that owns the table, or have database superuser or administrative privileges.
