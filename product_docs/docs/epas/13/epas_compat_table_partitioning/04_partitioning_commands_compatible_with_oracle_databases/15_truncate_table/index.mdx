title: "TRUNCATE TABLE"
---

<div id="truncate_table" class="registered_link"></div>

Use the `TRUNCATE TABLE` command to remove the contents of a table, while preserving the table definition. When you truncate a table, any partitions or subpartitions of that table are also truncated. The syntax is:

```text
TRUNCATE TABLE <table_name>
```

**Parameters**

`table_name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the partitioned table.

**Description**

The `TRUNCATE TABLE` command removes an entire table, and the data that resides in that table. When you delete a table, any partitions or subpartitions (of that table) are deleted as well.

To use the `TRUNCATE TABLE` command, you must be the owner of the partitioning root, a member of a group that owns the table, the schema owner, or a database superuser.
