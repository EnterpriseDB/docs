EDB provides a number of native packages in the EDB repository. The packages vary slightly for the various Linux variations, see:

- [RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux/SLES Packages](#rhelrocky-linuxalmalinuxsles-packages)
- [Debian/Ubuntu Packages](#debianubuntu-packages)

## RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux/SLES Packages

### EDB Postgres Advanced Server RPM Packages

The tables that follow list the RPM packages that are available from EDB. You can also use the `yum search` or `dnf search` command to access a list of the packages that are currently available from your configured repository. Open a command line, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8:

```text
dnf search <package>
```

Where `package` is the search term that specifies the name (or partial name) of a package.

Note: The available package list is subject to change.

| edb-pgpool41                     | This package contains the pgPool-II installer. The pgpool-II utility package acts as a middleman between client applications and Server database servers. pgpool-II functionality is transparent to client applications; client applications connect to pgpool-II instead of directly to EDB Postgres Advanced Server, and pgpool-II manages the connection. EDB supports the following pgpool-II features: <br />-   Load balancing    <br /> -   Connection pooling   <br /> -   High availability   <br /> -   Connection limits   <br /><br /><br />pgpool-II runs as a service on Linux systems, and is not supported on Windows systems.<br /> |
