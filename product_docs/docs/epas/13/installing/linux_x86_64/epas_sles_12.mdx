## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Activate the required SUSE module
  ```shell
  sudo SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/x86_64
  sudo SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/x86_64

  ```
- Refresh the metadata
  ```shell
  sudo zypper refresh
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo zypper -n install edb-as<xx>-server
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of the EDB Postgres Advanced server you are installing. For example, if you are installing version 13, the package name would be `edb-as13-server`.

To install an individual component:

```shell
sudo zypper -n install <package_name>
```

Where `package_name` can be any of the available packages from the [available package list](/epas/13/installing/linux_install_details/rpm_packages/).

## Initial configuration

This section steps you through getting started with your cluster including logging in, ensuring the installation and initial configuration was successful, connecting to your cluster, and creating the user password.

First you need to initialize and start the database cluster. The `edb-as-13-setup` script creates a cluster in Oracle-compatible mode with the `edb` sample database in the cluster. To create a cluster in Postgres mode, see [Initializing the cluster in Postgres mode](../linux_install_details/managing_an_advanced_server_installation/#initializing-the-cluster-in-postgres-mode).

```shell
sudo PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS="-E UTF-8" /usr/edb/as13/bin/edb-as-13-setup initdb

sudo systemctl start edb-as-13
```

To work in your cluster, login as the enterprisedb user. Connect to the database server using the psql command line client (although you can use a client of your choice with the appropriate connection string).

```shell
sudo su - enterprisedb

psql edb
```

The server runs with the `peer` or `ident` permission by default. You can change the authentication method by modifying the `pg_hba.conf` file.

Before changing the authentication method, assign a password to the database superuser, enterprisedb. For more information on changing the authentication, see [modifying the pg_hba.conf file](/epas/latest/epas_guide/03_database_administration/01_configuration_parameters/01_setting_new_parameters/#modifying-the-pg_hbaconf-file).

```sql
ALTER ROLE enterprisedb IDENTIFIED BY password;
```

## Experiment

Now you are ready to create and connect to a database, create a table, insert data in a table, and view the data from the table.

First let's create a database to hold human resource information named `hr` using psql.

```sql
# running in psql
CREATE DATABASE hr;
__OUTPUT__
CREATE DATABASE
```

Connect to the `hr` database inside psql.

```
\c hr
__OUTPUT__
psql (15.2.0, server 15.2.0)
You are now connected to database "hr" as user "enterprisedb".
```

Create columns to hold department numbers, unique department names, and locations.

```
CREATE TABLE public.dept (deptno numeric(2) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT dept_pk
PRIMARY KEY, dname varchar(14) CONSTRAINT dept_dname_uq UNIQUE, loc
varchar(13));
__OUTPUT__
CREATE TABLE
```

Insert values into the `dept` table.

```
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (10,'ACCOUNTING','NEW YORK');
__OUTPUT__
INSERT 0 1
```

```
INSERT into dept VALUES (20,'RESEARCH','DALLAS');
__OUTPUT__
INSERT 0 1
```

View what is in the table by selecting the values from the table.

```
SELECT * FROM dept;
__OUTPUT__
deptno  |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
10      | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
20      | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
(2 rows)
```
