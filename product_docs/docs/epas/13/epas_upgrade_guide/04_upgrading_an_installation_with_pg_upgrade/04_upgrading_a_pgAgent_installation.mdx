If your existing Advanced Server installation uses pgAgent, you can use a script provided with the Advanced Server 13 installer to update pgAgent. The script is named `dbms_job.upgrade.script.sql`, and is located in the `/share/contrib/` directory under your Advanced Server installation.

If you are using `pg_upgrade` to upgrade your installation, you should:

1.  Perform the upgrade.
2.  Invoke the `dbms_job.upgrade.script.sql` script to update the catalog files. If your existing pgAgent installation was performed with a script, the update will convert the installation to an extension.
