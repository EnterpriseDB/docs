<div id="reverting_to_the_old_cluster" class="registered_link"></div>


The method used to revert to a previous cluster varies with the options specified when invoking `pg_upgrade`:

-   If you specified the `--check` option when invoking `pg_upgrade`, an upgrade has not been performed, and no modifications have been made to the old cluster; you can re-use the old cluster at any time.
-   If you included the `--link` option when invoking `pg_upgrade`, the data files are shared between the old and new cluster after the upgrade completes. If you have started the server that is servicing the new cluster, the new server has written to those shared files and it is unsafe to use the old cluster.
-   If you ran `pg_upgrade` without the `--link` specification or have not started the new server, the old cluster is unchanged, except that the `.old` suffix has been appended to the `$PGDATA/global/pg_control` and tablespace directories.
-   To reuse the old cluster, delete the tablespace directories created by the new cluster and remove the `.old` suffix from `$PGDATA/global/pg_control` and the old cluster tablespace directory names and restart the server that services the old cluster.
