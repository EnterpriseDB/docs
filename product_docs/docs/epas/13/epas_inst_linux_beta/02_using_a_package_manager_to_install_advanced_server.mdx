<div id="using_a_package_manager_to_install_advanced_server" class="registered_link"></div>


You can use the yum package manager to install Advanced Server or Advanced Server supporting components. yum will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but requires access to the Advanced Server repositories. If your system does not have access to a repository via the Internet, you can use RPM to install an individual package or create a local repository, but you may be required to manually satisfy package dependencies.

You can list the dependencies of a package by running the following command:

> `repoquery --requires --resolve <package_name>`

Where, *package\_name* is the name of the package that you want to install.

Installing the server package creates a database superuser named `enterprisedb`. The user is assigned a user ID (UID) and a group ID (GID) of `26`. The user has no default password; use the `passwd` command to assign a password for the user. The default shell for the user is `bash`, and the user's home directory is `/var/lib/edb/as13`.

By default, Advanced Server logging is configured to write files to the `log` subdirectory of the `data` directory, rotating the files each day and retaining one week of log entries. You can customize the logging behavior of the server by [modifying the postgresql.conf File](#modifying_the_postgresqlconf_file).

The RPM installers place Advanced Server components in the directories listed in the table below:

| Component                         | Location                                   |

## Installing Advanced Server on a Linux Host

Before using an RPM package to install Advanced Server on a Linux host, you must:

**Install Linux-specific Software**

You must install `xterm, konsole`, or `gnome-terminal` before executing any console-based program installed by EnterpriseDB installers.

**Request Credentials to the EnterpriseDB Repository**

You must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

<https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf>.

After receiving your repository credentials you can:

1.  Create the repository configuration file.
2.  Modify the file, providing your user name and password.
3.  Install the repository keys and additional prerequisite software.
4.  Install Advanced Server and supporting components.

### Creating a Repository Configuration File and Installing Advanced Server

To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

> `yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm`

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d.`

After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to set the value of the `enabled` parameter to `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

``` text
[edb-testing]
name=EnterpriseDB Testing - Not For Production $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=<https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-testing/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch>
enabled=0
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```

After saving your changes to the configuration file, you must download and install the repository keys:

1.  Use the following command to download the repository key:

    `curl -o /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY https://yum.enterprisedb.com/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY`

2.  Use the following command to install the key:

    `rpm --import /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY`

3.  Use the following commands to install the prerequisite software:

    `# yum -y install epel-release`

    `# yum makecache`

Then, you can use `yum install` command to install Advanced Server. For example, to install the server and its core components, use the command:

> `yum install edb-as13-server`

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system,`yum` may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter a `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

After installing Advanced Server, you must configure the installation. For more information, see [Configuring a Package Installation](#configuring_a_package_installation).

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

### Advanced Server RPM Packages

The tables that follow list the RPM packages that are available from EnterpriseDB. You can also use the yum search command to access a list of the packages that are currently available from your configured repository. Open a command line, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

`yum search <package>`

Where `package` is the search term that specifies the name (or partial name) of a package.

Please note: The available package list is subject to change.

### Updating an RPM Installation

If you have an existing Advanced Server RPM installation, you can use yum to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the `edb.repo` file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

> `yum upgrade edb-repo`

yum will update the `edb.repo` file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your `edb.repo` file. Then, you can use yum to upgrade all packages whose names include the expression edb:

> `yum upgrade edb*`

Please note that the `yum upgrade` command will only perform an update between minor releases; to update between major releases, you must use pg\_upgrade.

For more information about using yum commands and options, enter `yum --help` on your command line, or visit:

<https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/system_administrators_guide/ch-yum>

<div id="configuring_a_package_installation" class="registered_link"></div>

## Configuring a Package Installation

The packages that install the database server component create a unit file and service startup scripts.

### Creating a Database Cluster and Starting the Service

The PostgreSQL `initdb` command creates a database cluster; when installing Advanced Server with an RPM package, the `initdb` executable is in `/usr/edb/asx.x/bin`. After installing Advanced Server, you must manually configure the service and invoke `initdb` to create your cluster. When invoking `initdb`, you can:

-   Specify environment options on the command line.
-   Include the `systemd` service manager on RHEL or CentOS 7.x and use a service configuration file to configure the environment.

To review the `initdb` documentation, visit:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-initdb.html>

After specifying any options in the service configuration file, you can create the database cluster and start the service; these steps are platform specific.

**On RHEL or CentOS 7.x**

To invoke `initdb` on a RHEL or CentOS 7.x system, with the options specified in the service configuration file, assume the identity of the operating system superuser:

> `su - root`

To initialize a cluster with the non-default values, you can use the `PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS` environment variable by invoking the `edb-as-13-setup` cluster initialization script that resides under `EPAS_Home/bin`.

To invoke `initdb` export the `PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS` environment variable with the following command:

> `PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS="-E UTF-8" /usr/edb/as13/bin/edb-as-13-setup initdb`

After creating the cluster, use `systemctl` to start, stop, or restart the service:

> `systemctl { start \| stop \| restart } edb-as-13`

<div id="specifying_cluster_options_with_initdbopts" class="registered_link"></div>

#### Specifying Cluster Options with INITDBOPTS

You can use the `INITDBOPTS` variable to specify your cluster configuration preferences. By default, the `INITDBOPTS` variable is commented out in the service configuration file; unless modified, when you run the service startup script, the new cluster will be created in a mode compatible with Oracle databases. Clusters created in this mode will contain a database named `edb`, and have a database superuser named `enterprisedb`.

Clusters created in PostgreSQL mode do not include compatibility features. To create a new cluster in PostgreSQL mode, remove the pound sign (\#) in front of the `INITDBOPTS` variable, enabling the `"--no-redwood-compat"` option. Clusters created in PostgreSQL mode will contain a database named `postgres`, and have a database superuser named `postgres`.

If you initialize the database using Oracle compatibility mode, the installation includes:

-   Data dictionary views compatible with Oracle databases.
-   Oracle data type conversions.
-   Date values displayed in a format compatible with Oracle syntax.
-   Support for Oracle-styled concatenation rules (if you concatenate a string value with a `NULL` value, the returned value is the value of the string).
-   Support for the following Oracle built-in packages:

| Package         | Functionality compatible with Oracle Databases                                                                                                                              |

You may also specify multiple `initdb` options. For example, the following statement:

> `INITDBOPTS="--no-redwood-compat -U alice --locale=en_US.UTF-8"`

Creates a database cluster (without compatibility features for Oracle) that contains a database named `postgres` that is owned by a user named `alice`; the cluster uses `UTF-8` encoding.

In addition to the cluster configuration options documented in the PostgreSQL core documentation, Advanced Server supports the following `initdb` options:

> `--no-redwood-compat`

Include the `--no-redwood-compat` keywords to instruct the server to create the cluster in PostgreSQL mode. When the cluster is created in PostgreSQL mode, the name of the database superuser will be `postgres`, the name of the default database will be `postgres`, and Advanced Server’s features compatible with Oracle databases will not be available to the cluster.

> `--redwood-like`

Include the `--redwood-like` keywords to instruct the server to use an escape character (an empty string ('')) following the `LIKE` (or PostgreSQL-compatible `ILIKE`) operator in a SQL statement that is compatible with Oracle syntax.

> `--icu-short-form`

Include the `--icu-short-form` keywords to create a cluster that uses a default ICU (International Components for Unicode) collation for all databases in the cluster. For more information about Unicode collations, please refer to the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server Guide* available at:

> <https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs>

For more information about using `initdb`, and the available cluster configuration options, see the PostgreSQL Core Documentation available at:

> <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-initdb.html>

You can also view online help for `initdb` by assuming superuser privileges and entering:

> `/<path_to_initdb_installation_directory>/initdb --help`

Where `path_to_initdb_installation_directory` specifies the location of the `initdb` binary file.

### Modifying the Data Directory Location on CentOS or Redhat 7.x

On a CentOS or RedHat version 7.x host, the unit file is named `edb-as-13.service` and resides in `/usr/lib/systemd/system`. The unit file contains references to the location of the Advanced Server `data` directory. You should avoid making any modifications directly to the unit file because it may be overwritten during package upgrades.

By default, data files reside under `/var/lib/edb/as13/data` directory. To use a data directory that resides in a non-default location, perform the following steps:

1.  create a copy of the unit file under the `/etc` directory:

    `cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-13.service /etc/systemd/system/`

2.  After copying the unit file to the new location, create the service file `(/etc/systemd/system/edb-as-13.service)`.

3.  Update the following values with new location of data directory in the `/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-13.service` file:

> `Environment=PGDATA=/var/lib/edb/as13/data`
>
> `PIDFile=/var/lib/edb/as13/data/postmaster.pid`

1.  Delete the entire content of `/etc/systemd/system/edb-as-13.service` file, except the following line:

> `.include /lib/systemd/system/edb-as-13.service`

1.  Run the following command to initialize the cluster at the new location:

> `PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS="-E UTF-8" /usr/edb/as13/bin/edb-as-13-setup initdb`

1.  Use the following command to reload `systemd`, updating the modified service scripts:

> `systemctl daemon-reload`

1.  Start the Advanced Server service with the following command:

> `systemctl start edb-as-13`

For information about setting an environment variable, see the [Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Reference Guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/d/edb-postgres-advanced-server/reference/database-compatibility-for-oracle-developers-reference-guide/12/toc.html).

### Starting Multiple Postmasters with Different Clusters

You can configure Advanced Server to use multiple postmasters, each with its own database cluster. The steps required are version specific to the Linux host.

**On RHEL or CentOS 7.x**

The `edb-as13-server-core` RPM for version 7.x contains a unit file that starts the Advanced Server instance. The file allows you to start multiple services, with unique `data` directories and that monitor different ports. You must have `root` access to invoke or modify the script.

The example that follows creates an Advanced Server installation with two instances; the secondary instance is named `secondary`:

1.  Make a copy of the default file with the new name. As noted at the top of the file, all modifications must reside under `/etc`. You must pick a name that is not already used `in /etc/systemd/system`.

    > `cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-13.service /etc/systemd/system/secondary-edb-as-13.service`

2.  Edit the file, changing `PGDATA` to point to the new `data` directory that you will create the cluster against.

3.  Create the target `PGDATA` with user `enterprisedb`.

4.  Run `initdb`, specifying the setup script:

> `/usr/edb/as13/bin/edb-as-13-setup initdb secondary-edb-as-13`

1.  Edit the `postgresql.conf` file for the new instance, specifying the port, the IP address, TCP/IP settings, etc.

2.  Make sure that new cluster runs after a reboot:

    `systemctl enable secondary-edb-as-13`

3.  Start the second cluster with the following command:

    `systemctl start secondary-edb-as-13`

### Creating an Advanced Server Repository on an Isolated Network

You can create a local repository to act as a host for the Advanced Server RPM packages if the server on which you wish to install Advanced Server (or supporting components) cannot directly access the EnterpriseDB repository. Please note that this is a high-level listing of the steps requires; you will need to modify the process for your individual network.

To create and use a local repository, you must:

1.  Use yum to install the `epel-release`, `yum-utils`, and `createrepo` packages:

``` bash
yum install epel-release
yum install yum-utils
yum install createrepo
```

1.  Create a directory in which to store the repository:

    > `mkdir /srv/repos`

2.  Copy the RPM installation packages to your local repository. You can download the individual packages or use a tarball to populate the repository. The packages are available from the EnterpriseDB repository at:

    > `https://yum.enterprisedb.com/`

3.  Sync the RPM packages and create the repository.

    > `reposync -r edbas13 -p /srv/repos createrepo /srv/repos`

4.  Install your preferred webserver on the host that will act as your local repository, and ensure that the repository directory is accessible to the other servers on your network.

5.  On each isolated database server, configure yum to pull updates from the mirrored repository on your local network. For example, you might create a repository configuration file called `/etc/yum.repos.d/edb-repo` with connection information that specifies:

``` text
[edbas13]
name=EnterpriseDB Advanced Server 13
baseurl=https:yum.your_domain.com/edbas13
enabled=1
gpgcheck=0
```

After specifying the location and connection information for your local repository, you can use yum commands to install Advanced Server and its supporting components on the isolated servers. For example:

> `yum install edb-as13-server`
