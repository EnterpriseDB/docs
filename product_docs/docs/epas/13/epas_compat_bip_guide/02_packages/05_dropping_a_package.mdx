The syntax for deleting an entire package or just the package body is as follows:

```text
DROP PACKAGE [ BODY ] package_name;
```

If the keyword, `BODY`, is omitted, both the package specification and the package body are deleted - i.e., the entire package is dropped. If the keyword, `BODY`, is specified, then only the package body is dropped. The package specification remains intact. `package_name` is the identifier of the package to be dropped.

Following statement will destroy only the package body of `emp_admin`:

```text
DROP PACKAGE BODY emp_admin;
```

The following statement will drop the entire `emp_admin` package:

```text
DROP PACKAGE emp_admin;
```
