Advanced Server provides support for the `DBMS_LOCK.SLEEP` procedure.

| Function/Procedure | Return Type | Description                                               |
| ------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `SLEEP(seconds)`   | n/a         | Suspends a session for the specified number of `seconds`. |

Advanced Server's implementation of `DBMS_LOCK` is a partial implementation when compared to Oracle's version. Only `DBMS_LOCK.SLEEP` is supported.

## SLEEP

The `SLEEP` procedure suspends the current session for the specified number of seconds.

```text
SLEEP(<seconds> NUMBER)
```

**Parameters**

`seconds`

 `seconds` specifies the number of seconds for which you wish to suspend the session. `seconds` can be a fractional value; for example, enter `1.75` to specify one and three-fourths of a second.
