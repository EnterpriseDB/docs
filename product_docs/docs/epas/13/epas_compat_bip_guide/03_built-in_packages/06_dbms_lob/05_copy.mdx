The `COPY` procedure provides the capability to copy one large object to another. The source and destination large objects must be the same data type.

``` text
COPY(<dest_lob> IN OUT { BLOB | CLOB }, <src_lob>
{ BLOB | CLOB },
  <amount> INTEGER
  [, <dest_offset> INTEGER [, <src_offset> INTEGER ]])
```

**Parameters**

`dest_lob`

> Large object locator of the large object to which `src_lob` is to be copied. Must be the same data type as `src_lob`.

`src_lob`

> Large object locator of the large object to be copied to `dest_lob`. Must be the same data type as `dest_lob`.

`amount`

> Number of bytes/characters of `src_lob` to be copied.

`dest_offset`

> Position in the destination large object where writing of the source large object should begin. The first position is offset 1. The default is 1.

`src_offset`

> Position in the source large object where copying to the destination large object should begin. The first position is offset 1. The default is 1.
