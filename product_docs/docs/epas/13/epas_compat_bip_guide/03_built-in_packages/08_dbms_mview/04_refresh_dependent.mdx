title: "REFRESH_DEPENDENT"
---



Use the `REFRESH_DEPENDENT` procedure to refresh all material views that are dependent on the views specified in the call to the procedure. You can specify a comma-separated list or provide the view names in a table of `DBMS_UTILITY.UNCL_ARRAY` values.

Use the first form of the procedure to refresh all material views that are dependent on the views specified in a comma-separated list:

``` text
REFRESH_DEPENDENT(
  <number_of_failures> OUT BINARY_INTEGER,
  <list> IN VARCHAR2,
  <method> IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL,
  <rollback_seg> IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL
  <refresh_after_errors> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  <atomic_refresh> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  <nested> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE);
```

Use the second form of the procedure to refresh all material views that are dependent on the views specified in a table of `DBMS_UTILITY.UNCL_ARRAY` values:

``` text
REFRESH_DEPENDENT(
  <number_of_failures> OUT BINARY_INTEGER,
  <tab> IN DBMS_UTILITY.UNCL_ARRAY,
  <method> IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL,
  <rollback_seg> IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL,
  <refresh_after_errors> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  <atomic_refresh> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  <nested> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE);
```

**Parameters**

`number_of_failures`

> `number_of_failures` is a `BINARY_INTEGER` that contains the number of failures that occurred during the refresh operation.

`list`

> `list` is a `VARCHAR2` value that specifies the name of a materialized view, or a comma-separated list of materialized view names. The names may be schema-qualified.

`tab`

> `tab` is a table of `DBMS_UTILITY.UNCL_ARRAY` values that specify the name (or names) of a materialized view.

`method`

> `method` is a `VARCHAR2` value that specifies the refresh method that will be applied to the specified view (or views). The only supported method is `C`; this performs a complete refresh of the view.

`rollback_seg`

> `rollback_seg` is accepted for compatibility and ignored. The default is `NULL`.

`refresh_after_errors`

> `refresh_after_errors` is accepted for compatibility and ignored. The default is `FALSE`.

`atomic_refresh`

> `atomic_refresh` is accepted for compatibility and ignored. The default is `TRUE`.

`nested`

> `nested` is accepted for compatibility and ignored. The default is `FALSE`.

**Examples**

The following example performs a `COMPLETE` refresh on all materialized views dependent on a materialized view named `emp_view` that resides in the `public` schema:

``` text
DECLARE
  errors INTEGER;
BEGIN
  DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH_DEPENDENT(errors, list => 'public.emp_view', method =>
'C');
END;
```

Upon completion, `errors` contains the number of failures.
