The `INTERVAL` procedure sets the frequency of how often a job is to be run.

```text
INTERVAL(<job> BINARY_INTEGER, <interval> VARCHAR2)
```

**Parameters**

`job`

 Identifier of the job to modify.

`interval`

 Date function that when evaluated, provides the next date/time the job is to be run. If `interval` is `NULL` and the job is complete, the job is removed from the queue.

**Examples**

Change the job to run once a week:

```text
BEGIN
    DBMS_JOB.INTERVAL(104,'SYSDATE + 7');
END;
```
