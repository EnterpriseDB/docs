The `INTERVAL` procedure sets the frequency of how often a job is to be run.

``` text

```

**Parameters**

`job`

> Identifier of the job to modify.

`interval`

> Date function that when evaluated, provides the next date/time the job is to be run. If `interval` is `NULL` and the job is complete, the job is removed from the queue.

Change the job to run once a week:

``` text
BEGIN
    DBMS_JOB.INTERVAL(104,'SYSDATE + 7');
END;
```
