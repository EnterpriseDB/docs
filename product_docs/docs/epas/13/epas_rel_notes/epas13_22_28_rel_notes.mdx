| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue where a high number of concurrent failed login attempts for a user was leading to an unexpected server behavior.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                                                                                                     |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue by ensuring the SPL library is initialized before accessing its symbols to avoid errors.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | #44514                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue in EDB*Loader where the SKIP parameter did not work correctly in direct-path mode on tables with column constraints.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | #44853                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue in `dblink_oci` that caused a random server crash when performing bytea inserts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | #49578                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue where `to_date()` was not handling empty strings gracefully.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | #49346                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue in `edb_audit` that was causing unexpected audit logs during user login.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | #48070                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue where an error occurred with SPLIT PARTITION on tables that use a GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY column.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | #49164                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue in `SUBSTRB()` that caused garbage bytes to appear in the return string. The function now replaces partial multi-byte characters with spaces to prevent this.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | #46619                                                                                              |
