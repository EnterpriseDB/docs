| Upstream Merges | Merged with community PostgreSQL 13 and 13.1. See the community Release Notes of [13](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/13/release-13.html) and [13.1](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/13.1/) for details.                                                                                                                                                 |
| Feature         | Automatic LIST Partitioning is an extension to LIST partitioning that allows a database to automatically create a partition for any new distinct value of the LIST partitioning key. A new partition is created when data is inserted into the LIST partitioned table and the inserted value does not match any of the existing table partitions.                |
| Feature         | Additional `smallint`, `int`, `bigint`, and `numeric` variants in the `MEDIAN` aggregate function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Feature         | Added support for `CREATE INDEX` syntax that contains a column name and number, i.e. `(col_name,1)`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Feature         | Added support to alter the owner of the directory - `ALTER DIRECTORY <dir_name> OWNER TO <role_name>`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Feature         | CSV and XML audit logs have been made consistent. It has been observed that there is a difference in terms of number of fields in the CSV and XML formatted audit logs. Now the audit log is consistent across both formats.                                                                                                                                     |
| Feature         | Default behaviour for `dbms_output` made compatible with Redwood. By default, the `dbms_output` behaviour is `off` in Oracle; in EPAS it is always `on`. In this release, EPAS adds a GUC to control the default behaviour for `DBMS_OUTPUT` package.                                                                                                            |
| Feature         | You can log the number of processed statements with `edb_log_every_bulk_value`.<br />Currently, during bulk execution EPAS did not identify the number of rows processed when `edb_log_every_bulk_value` was `off`. This feature allows EPAS to log it both in the audit log file and server log file. This will help you analyze the logs for such cases.       |
| Feature         | Previously, EDB Loader would abort the whole operation if any record insertion fails due to a unique constraint violation. This is fixed by using speculative insertion to insert rows. This behavior is enforced if `handle_conflicts` (a new parameter) is `true` and indexes are present.                                                                     |
| Feature         | `SYSDATE` now behaves in a more compatible manner. `SYSDATE` output changes at every nesting level, so multiple copies of SYSDATE in the same SQL query will return the same value each time. `SYSDATE` changes on successive statements in the same procedure or within a nested function call.                                                                 |
| Feature         | `PARALLEL [n] \| NOPARALLEL` option for `CREATE TABLE` and `INDEX`. Advanced Server now supports the `PARALLEL [n] \|  NOPARALLEL` clause in the `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `CREATE INDEX`, and `ALTER INDEX` commands to enable or disable parallelism on an index or a table.                                                                              |
| Feature         | `PARTITION [n]` or `SUBPARTITION [n]` while creating a table. This feature allows you to automatically create `[n]` hash partitions at a subpartition level.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Feature         | EDB Loader supports any connection parameters. You can use the EDB Loader `-c` or `CONNSTR` options to specify any connection parameters supported by libpq. This includes SSL connection parameters.                                                                                                                                                            |
| Feature         | The `STATS_MODE` function takes a set of values as an argument and returns the value that occurs with the highest frequency. If multiple values appear with the same frequency, the `STATS_MODE` function arbitrarily chooses the first value and returns only that one value.                                                                                   |
| Feature         | Added support for DBMS_SQL function/procedures (`DEFINE_COLUMN_LONG`, `COLUMN_VALUE_LONG` and `LAST_ERROR_POSITION`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Feature         | Added support for function `to_timestamp_tz()`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Feature         | Added support for function/procedure specification inside package body.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Feature         | Added support for FM format in `to_number` function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Feature         | Added support for `AES192` and `AES256` in the `DBMS_CRYPTO` package.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Feature         | Added support for the spell mode in `to_char(timestamptz, text)` function.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Feature         | Allow creating a compound trigger having `WHEN` clause with `NEW/OLD` variables and `STATEMENT` level triggering events. Enhanced Redwood compatible view.                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Feature         | Log matched line of `pg_hba.conf` on successful client authentication. Enhanced `pg_catcheck` to test for and raise an error if a relation's `relfilenode` is missing from the `data` directory.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Feature         | Added support for `utl_http.end_of_body` exception. This feature declares the `end_of_body` exception into `utl_http` package and throws the same from `read_line`, `read_text`, and `read_raw` package procedures when no data is left in the response body.                                                                                                    |
| Feature         | The `UNIQUE` and `PRIMARY KEY` constraint clauses now have a `CREATE INDEX` statement. This new syntax allows users to specify explicit index details like fillfactor, etc. Columns specified in the constraint and the columns specified in the index must be the same.                                                                                         |
