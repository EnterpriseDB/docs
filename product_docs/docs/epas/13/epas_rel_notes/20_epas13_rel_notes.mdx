New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in EDB Postgres Advanced Server 13 include:

| Type        | Description      | 
| ----------- | ---------------- | 
| Feature     | Automatic LIST Partitioning is an extension to LIST partitioning that allows a database to automatically create a partition for any new distinct value of the LIST partitioning key. A new partition is created when data is inserted into the LIST partitioned table and the inserted value does not match any of the existing table partitions. |
| Feature     | Additional `smallint`, `int`, `bigint`, and `numeric` variants in the `MEDIAN` aggregate function. |
| Feature     | Added support for `CREATE INDEX` syntax that contains a column name and number, i.e. `(col_name,1)`. |
| Feature     | Added support to alter the owner of the directory - `ALTER DIRECTORY <dir_name> OWNER TO <role_name>`. |
| Feature     | CSV and XML audit logs have been made consistent. It has been observed that there is a difference in terms of number of fields in the CSV and XML formatted audit logs. Now the audit log is consistent across both formats. |
| Feature     | Default behaviour for `dbms_output` made compatible with Redwood. By default, the `dbms_output` behaviour is `off` in Oracle; in EPAS it is always `on`. In this release, EPAS adds a GUC to control the default behaviour for `DBMS_OUTPUT` package. |
| Feature     | You can log the number of processed statements with `edb_log_every_bulk_value`. |             | Currently, during bulk execution EPAS did not identify the number of rows processed when `edb_log_every_bulk_value` was `off`. This feature allows EPAS to log it both in the audit log file and server log file. This will help you analyze the logs for such cases. |
| Feature     | Previously, EDB Loader would abort the whole operation if any record insertion fails due to a unique constraint violation. This is fixed by using speculative insertion to insert rows. This behavior is enforced if `handle_conflicts` (a new parameter) is `true` and indexes are present. |
| Feature     | `SYSDATE` now behaves in a more compatible manner. `SYSDATE` output changes at every nesting level, so multiple copies of SYSDATE in the same SQL query will return the same value each time. `SYSDATE` changes on successive statements in the same procedure, or within a nested function call. |
| Feature     | `PARALLEL [n] | NOPARALLEL` option for `CREATE TABLE` and `INDEX`. Advanced Server now supports the `PARALLEL [n] |  NOPARALLEL` clause in the `CREATE TABLE`, `ALTER TABLE`, `CREATE INDEX`, and `ALTER INDEX` commands to enable or disable parallelism on an index or a table. |
| Feature     | `PARTITION [n]` or `SUBPARTITION [n]` while creating a table. This feature allows you to automatically create `[n]` hash partitions at a subpartition level. |
| Feature     | EDB Loader supports any connection parameters. You can use the EDB Loader `-c` or `CONNSTR` options to specify any connection parameters supported by libpq. This includes SSL connection parameters. |
| Feature     | The `STATS_MODE` function takes a set of values as an argument and returns the value that occurs with the highest frequency. If multiple values appear with the same frequency, the `STATS_MODE` function arbitrarily chooses the first value and returns only that one value. |
| Feature     | Added support for DBMS_SQL function/procedures (`DEFINE_COLUMN_LONG`, `COLUMN_VALUE_LONG` and `LAST_ERROR_POSITION`). |
| Feature     | Added support for function `to_timestamp_tz()`. |
| Feature     | Added support for function/procedure specification inside package body. |
| Feature     | Added support for FM format in `to_number` function. |
| Feature     | Added support for `AES192` and `AES256` in the `DBMS_CRYPTO` package. |
| Feature     | Added support for the spell mode in `to_char(timestamptz, text)` function. |
| Feature     | Allow creating a compound trigger having `WHEN` clause with `NEW/OLD` variables and `STATEMENT` level triggering events. Enhanced Redwood compatible view. |
| Feature     | Log matched line of `pg_hba.conf` on successful client authentication. Enhanced `pg_catcheck` to test for and raise an error if a relation's `relfilenode` is missing from the `data` directory. |
| Feature     | Added support for `utl_http.end_of_body` exception. This feature declares the `end_of_body` exception into `utl_http` package and throws the same from `read_line`, `read_text`, and `read_raw` package procedures when no data is left in the response body. |
| Feature     | The `UNIQUE` and `PRIMARY KEY` constraint clauses now have a `CREATE INDEX` statement. This new syntax allows users to specify explicit index details like fillfactor, etc. Columns specified in the constraint and the columns specified in the index must be the same. |
