title: "Invoking the Graphical Installer from the Command Line"

<div id="invoking_the_graphical_installer_from_the_command_line" class="registered_link"></div>

The command line options of the Advanced Server installer offer functionality for Windows systems that reside in situations where a graphical installation may not work because of limited resources or privileges. You can:

-   Include the `--mode unattended` option when invoking the installer to perform an installation without user input.
-   Invoke the installer with the `--extract-only` option to perform a minimal installation when you donâ€™t hold the privileges required to perform a complete installation.

Not all command line options are suitable for all situations. For a complete reference guide to the command line options, see [Reference - Command Line Options](03_reference_command_line_options/#reference_command_line_options).

!!! Note
    If you are invoking the installer from the command line to perform a system upgrade, the installer will ignore command line options, and preserve the configuration of the previous installation.
