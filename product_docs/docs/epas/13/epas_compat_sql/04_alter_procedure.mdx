**Name**

`ALTER PROCEDURE`

**Synopsis**

```text
ALTER PROCEDURE <procedure_name options> [RESTRICT]
```

**Description**

Use the `ALTER PROCEDURE` statement to specify that a procedure is a `SECURITY INVOKER` or `SECURITY DEFINER`.

**Parameters**

`procedure_name`

 `procedure_name` specifies the (possibly schema-qualified) name of a stored procedure.

`options` may be:

-   `[EXTERNAL] SECURITY DEFINER`

    Specify `SECURITY DEFINER` to instruct the server to execute the procedure with the privileges of the user that created the procedure. The `EXTERNAL` keyword is accepted for compatibility, but ignored.

-   `[EXTERNAL] SECURITY INVOKER`

    Specify `SECURITY INVOKER` to instruct the server to execute the procedure with the privileges of the user that is invoking the procedure. The `EXTERNAL` keyword is accepted for compatibility, but ignored.

The `RESTRICT` keyword is accepted for compatibility, but ignored.

**Examples**

The following command specifies that the `update_balance` procedure should execute with the privileges of the user invoking the procedure:

```text
ALTER PROCEDURE update_balance SECURITY INVOKER;
```
