title: "Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers SQL Guide"
---

This guide provides a summary of the SQL commands compatible with Oracle databases that are supported by Advanced Server. The SQL commands in this section will work on both an Oracle database and an Advanced Server database.

Note the following points:

-   Advanced Server supports other commands that are not listed here. These commands may have no Oracle equivalent or they may provide the similar or same functionality as an Oracle SQL command, but with different syntax.
-   The SQL commands in this section do not necessarily represent the full syntax, options, and functionality available for each command. In most cases, syntax, options, and functionality that are not compatible with Oracle databases have been omitted from the command description and syntax.
-   The Advanced Server documentation set documents command functionality that may not be compatible with Oracle databases.
