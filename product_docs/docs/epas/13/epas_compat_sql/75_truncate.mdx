**Name**

`TRUNCATE` -- empty a table.

**Synopsis**

```text
TRUNCATE TABLE <name> [DROP STORAGE]
```

**Description**

`TRUNCATE` quickly removes all rows from a table. It has the same effect as an unqualified `DELETE` but since it does not actually scan the table, it is faster. This is most useful on large tables.

The `DROP STORAGE` clause is accepted for compatibility, but is ignored.

**Parameters**

`name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table to be truncated.

**Notes**

`TRUNCATE` cannot be used if there are foreign-key references to the table from other tables. Checking validity in such cases would require table scans, and the whole point is not to do one.

`TRUNCATE` will not run any user-defined `ON DELETE` triggers that might exist for the table.

**Examples**

The following command truncates a table named `accounts`:

```text
TRUNCATE TABLE accounts;
```
