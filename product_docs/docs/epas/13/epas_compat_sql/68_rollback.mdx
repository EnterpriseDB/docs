**Name**

`ROLLBACK` -- abort the current transaction.

**Synopsis**

```text
ROLLBACK [ WORK ]
```

**Description**

`ROLLBACK` rolls back the current transaction and causes all the updates made by the transaction to be discarded.

**Parameters**

`WORK`

 Optional key word - has no effect.

**Notes**

Use `COMMIT` to successfully terminate a transaction.

Issuing `ROLLBACK` when not inside a transaction does no harm.

!!! Note
    Executing a `ROLLBACK` in a plpgsql procedure will throw an error if there is an Oracle-style SPL procedure on the runtime stack.

**Examples**

To abort all changes:

```text
ROLLBACK;
```
