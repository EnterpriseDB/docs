**Name**

`ALTER DIRECTORY --` change the owner of a directory created using [CREATE DIRECTORY](#create_directory) command.

**Synopsis**

``` text
ALTER DIRECTORY <name> OWNER TO <rolename>
```

**Description**

The `ALTER DIRECTORY ...OWNER TO` command changes the owner of a directory. You must have the superuser privilege to execute this command; the new owner of the directory must also have the superuser privilege.

**Parameters**

`name`

> The name of the directory to be altered.

`rolename`

> The name of an owner that will own the directory.

**Examples**

The following example demonstrates changing ownership; `bob` and `carol` are superusers. `bob` is a current owner of directory `EMPDIR`:

``` text
SELECT * FROM all_directories where directory_name = 'EMPDIR' order
by 1,2,3;
 owner | directory_name | directory_path
-------+----------------+----------------
 bob   | EMPDIR         | /path
(1 row)
```

To alter the ownership of directory `EMPDIR` to `carol`:

``` text
ALTER DIRECTORY EMPDIR OWNER TO carol;
ALTER DIRECTORY

SELECT * FROM all_directories where directory_name = 'EMPDIR' order by
1,2,3;
 owner | directory_name | directory_path
-------+----------------+----------------
 carol | EMPDIR         | /path
(1 row)
```

The ownership of a directory is altered and granted to `carol`.
