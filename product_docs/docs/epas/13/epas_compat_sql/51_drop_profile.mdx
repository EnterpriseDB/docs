**Name**

`DROP PROFILE` -- drop a user-defined profile.

**Synopsis**

```text
DROP PROFILE [IF EXISTS] <profile_name> [CASCADE | RESTRICT];
```

**Description**

Include the `IF EXISTS` clause to instruct the server to not throw an error if the specified profile does not exist. The server will issue a notice if the profile does not exist.

Include the optional `CASCADE` clause to reassign any users that are currently associated with the profile to the `default` profile, and then drop the profile. Include the optional `RESTRICT` clause to instruct the server to not drop any profile that is associated with a role. This is the default behavior.

**Parameters**

`profile_name`

 The name of the profile being dropped.

**Examples**

The following example drops a profile named `acctg_profile`:

```text
DROP PROFILE acctg_profile CASCADE;
```

The command first re-associates any roles associated with the `acctg_profile` profile with the `default` profile, and then drops the `acctg_profile` profile.

The following example drops a profile named `acctg_profile`:

```text
DROP PROFILE acctg_profile RESTRICT;
```

The `RESTRICT` clause in the command instructs the server to not drop `acctg_profile` if there are any roles associated with the profile.
