**Name**

`INSERT` -- create new rows in a table.

**Synopsis**

```text
INSERT INTO <table>[@<dblink> ] [ ( <column> [, ...] ) ]
  { VALUES ( { <expression> | DEFAULT } [, ...] )
    [ RETURNING <return_expression> [, ...]
        { INTO { <record> | <variable> [, ...] }
        | BULK COLLECT INTO <collection> [, ...] } ]
  | <query> }
```

**Description**

`INSERT` allows you to insert new rows into a table. You can insert a single row at a time or several rows as a result of a query.

The columns in the target list may be listed in any order. Each column not present in the target list will be inserted using a default value, either its declared default value or null.

If the expression for each column is not of the correct data type, automatic type conversion will be attempted.

The `RETURNING INTO { record | variable [, ...] }` clause may only be specified when the `INSERT` command is used within an SPL program and only when the `VALUES` clause is used.

The `RETURNING BULK COLLECT INTO collection [, ...]` clause may only be specified if the `INSERT` command is used within an SPL program. If more than one `collection` is specified as the target of the `BULK COLLECT INTO` clause, then each `collection` must consist of a single, scalar field – i.e., `collection` must not be a record. `return_expression` evaluated for each inserted row, becomes an element in `collection` starting with the first element. Any existing rows in `collection` are deleted. If the result set is empty, then `collection` will be empty.

You must have `INSERT` privilege to a table in order to insert into it. If you use the `query` clause to insert rows from a query, you also need to have `SELECT` privilege on any table used in the query.

**Parameters**

`table`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing table.

`dblink`

 Database link name identifying a remote database. See the `CREATE DATABASE LINK` command for information on database links.

`column`

 The name of a column in `table`.

`expression`

 An expression or value to assign to `column`.

`DEFAULT`

 This column will be filled with its default value.

`query`

 A query (`SELECT` statement) that supplies the rows to be inserted. Refer to the `SELECT` command for a description of the syntax.

`return_expression`

 An expression that may include one or more columns from `table`. If a column name from `table` is specified in `return_expression`, the value substituted for the column when `return_expression` is evaluated is determined as follows:

-   If the column specified in `return_expression` is assigned a value in the `INSERT` command, then the assigned value is used in the evaluation of `return_expression`.

-   If the column specified in `return_expression` is not assigned a value in the `INSERT` command and there is no default value for the column in the table’s column definition, then null is used in the evaluation of `return_expression`.

-   If the column specified in `return_expression` is not assigned a value in the `INSERT` command and there is a default value for the column in the table’s column definition, then the default value is used in the evaluation of `return_expression`.

`record`

 A record whose field the evaluated `return_expression` is to be assigned. The first `return_expression` is assigned to the first field in `record`, the second `return_expression` is assigned to the second field in `record`, etc. The number of fields in `record` must exactly match the number of expressions and the fields must be type-compatible with their assigned expressions.

`variable`

 A variable to which the evaluated `return_expression` is to be assigned. If more than one `return_expression` and `variable` are specified, the first `return_expression` is assigned to the first `variable`, the second `return_expression` is assigned to the second `variable`, etc. The number of variables specified following the `INTO` keyword must exactly match the number of expressions following the `RETURNING` keyword and the variables must be type-compatible with their assigned expressions.

`collection`

 A collection in which an element is created from the evaluated `return_expression`. There can be either a single collection which may be a collection of a single field or a collection of a record type, or there may be more than one collection in which case each collection must consist of a single field. The number of return expressions must match in number and order the number of fields in all specified collections. Each corresponding `return_expression` and `collection` field must be type-compatible.

**Examples**

Insert a single row into table `emp`:

```text
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (8021,'JOHN','SALESMAN',7698,'22-FEB-07',1250,500,30);
```

In this second example, the column, `comm`, is omitted and therefore it will have the default value of null:

```text
INSERT INTO emp (empno, ename, job, mgr, hiredate, sal, deptno)
    VALUES (8022,'PETERS','CLERK',7698,'03-DEC-06',950,30);
```

The third example uses the `DEFAULT` clause for the `hiredate` and `comm` columns rather than specifying a value:

```text
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (8023,'FORD','ANALYST',7566,NULL,3000,NULL,20);
```

This example creates a table for the department names and then inserts into the table by selecting from the `dname` column of the `dept` table:

```text
CREATE TABLE deptnames (
    deptname        VARCHAR2(14)
);
INSERT INTO deptnames SELECT dname FROM dept;
```
