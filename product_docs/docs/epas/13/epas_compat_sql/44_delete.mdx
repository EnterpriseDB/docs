**Name**

`DELETE` -- delete rows of a table.

**Synopsis**

```text
DELETE [ <optimizer_hint> ] FROM <table>[@<dblink> ]
  [ WHERE <condition> ]
  [ RETURNING <return_expression> [, ...]
      { INTO { <record> | <variable> [, ...] }
      | BULK COLLECT INTO <collection> [, ...] } ]
```

**Description**

`DELETE` deletes rows that satisfy the `WHERE` clause from the specified table. If the `WHERE` clause is absent, the effect is to delete all rows in the table. The result is a valid, but empty table.

!!! Note
    The `TRUNCATE` command provides a faster mechanism to remove all rows from a table.

The `RETURNING INTO { record | variable [, ...] }` clause may only be specified if the `DELETE` command is used within an SPL program. In addition the result set of the `DELETE` command must not include more than one row, otherwise an exception is thrown. If the result set is empty, then the contents of the target record or variables are set to null.

The `RETURNING BULK COLLECT INTO collection [, ...]` clause may only be specified if the `DELETE` command is used within an SPL program. If more than one `collection` is specified as the target of the `BULK COLLECT INTO` clause, then each `collection` must consist of a single, scalar field â€“ i.e., `collection` must not be a record. The result set of the `DELETE` command may contain none, one, or more rows. `return_expression` evaluated for each row of the result set, becomes an element in `collection` starting with the first element. Any existing rows in `collection` are deleted. If the result set is empty, then `collection` will be empty.

You must have the `DELETE` privilege on the table to delete from it, as well as the `SELECT` privilege for any table whose values are read in the condition.

**Parameters**

`optimizer_hint`

 Comment-embedded hints to the optimizer for selection of an execution plan.

`table`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing table.

`dblink`

 Database link name identifying a remote database. See the `CREATE DATABASE LINK` command for information on database links.

`condition`

 A value expression that returns a value of type `BOOLEAN` that determines the rows which are to be deleted.

`return_expression`

 An expression that may include one or more columns from `table`. If a column name from `table` is specified in the `return_expression`, the value substituted for the column when `return_expression` is evaluated is the value from the deleted row.

`record`

 A record whose field the evaluated `return_expression` is to be assigned. The first `return_expression` is assigned to the first field in `record`, the second `return_expression` is assigned to the second field in `record`, etc. The number of fields in `record` must exactly match the number of expressions and the fields must be type-compatible with their assigned expressions.

`variable`

 A variable to which the evaluated `return_expression` is to be assigned. If more than one `return_expression` and `variable` are specified, the `first return_expression` is assigned to the first `variable`, the second `return_expression` is assigned to the second `variable`, etc. The number of variables specified following the `INTO` keyword must exactly match the number of expressions following the `RETURNING` keyword and the variables must be type-compatible with their assigned expressions.

`collection`

 A collection in which an element is created from the evaluated `return_expression`. There can be either a single collection which may be a collection of a single field or a collection of a record type, or there may be more than one collection in which case each collection must consist of a single field. The number of return expressions must match in number and order the number of fields in all specified collections. Each corresponding `return_expression` and `collection` field must be type-compatible.

**Examples**

Delete all rows for employee `7900` from the `jobhist` table:

```text
DELETE FROM jobhist WHERE empno = 7900;
```

Clear the table `jobhist`:

```text
DELETE FROM jobhist;
```
