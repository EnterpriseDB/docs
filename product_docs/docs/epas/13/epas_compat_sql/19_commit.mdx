**Name**

`COMMIT` -- commit the current transaction.

**Synopsis**

```text
COMMIT [ WORK ]
```

**Description**

`COMMIT` commits the current transaction. All changes made by the transaction become visible to others and are guaranteed to be durable if a crash occurs.

**Parameters**

`WORK`

 Optional key word - has no effect.

**Notes**

Use `ROLLBACK` to abort a transaction. Issuing `COMMIT` when not inside a transaction does no harm.

!!! Note
    Executing a `COMMIT` in a plpgsql procedure will throw an error if there is an Oracle-style SPL procedure on the runtime stack.

**Examples**

To commit the current transaction and make all changes permanent:

```text
COMMIT;
```
