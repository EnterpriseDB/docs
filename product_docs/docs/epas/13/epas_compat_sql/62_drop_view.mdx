**Name**

`DROP VIEW --` remove a view

**Synopsis**

``` text
DROP VIEW <name>
```

**Description**

`DROP VIEW` drops an existing view. To execute this command you must be a database superuser or the owner of the view. The named view will not be deleted if other objects are dependent upon this view (such as a view of a view).

The form of the `DROP VIEW` command compatible with Oracle does not support a `CASCADE` clause; to drop a view and it's dependencies, use the PostgreSQL-compatible form of the `DROP VIEW` command. For more information, see the PostgreSQL core documentation at:

> <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-dropview.html>

**Parameters**

`name`

> The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the view to remove.

**Examples**

This command will remove the view named `dept_30`:

``` text
DROP VIEW dept_30;
```
