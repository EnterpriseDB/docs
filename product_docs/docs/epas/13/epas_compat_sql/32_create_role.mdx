**Name**

`CREATE ROLE` -- define a new database role.

**Synopsis**

```text
CREATE ROLE <name> [IDENTIFIED BY <password> [REPLACE old_password]]
```

**Description**

`CREATE ROLE` adds a new role to the Advanced Server database cluster. A role is an entity that can own database objects and have database privileges; a role can be considered a “user”, a “group”, or both depending on how it is used. The newly created role does not have the `LOGIN` attribute, so it cannot be used to start a session. Use the `ALTER ROLE` command to give the role `LOGIN` rights. You must have `CREATEROLE` privilege or be a database superuser to use the `CREATE ROLE` command.

If the `IDENTIFIED BY` clause is specified, the `CREATE ROLE` command also creates a schema owned by, and with the same name as the newly created role.

!!! Note
    The roles are defined at the database cluster level, and so are valid in all databases in the cluster.

**Parameters**

`name`

 The name of the new role.

`IDENTIFIED BY password`

 Sets the role’s password. (A password is only of use for roles having the `LOGIN` attribute, but you can nonetheless define one for roles without it.) If you do not plan to use password authentication you can omit this option.

**Notes**

Use `ALTER ROLE` to change the attributes of a role, and `DROP ROLE` to remove a role. The attributes specified by `CREATE ROLE` can be modified by later `ALTER ROLE` commands.

Use `GRANT` and `REVOKE` to add and remove members of roles that are being used as groups.

The maximum length limit for role name and password is `63` characters.

**Examples**

Create a role (and a schema) named, `admins`, with a password:

```text
CREATE ROLE admins IDENTIFIED BY Rt498zb;
```
