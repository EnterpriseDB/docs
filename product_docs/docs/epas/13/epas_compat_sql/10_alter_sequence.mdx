**Name**

`ALTER SEQUENCE` --Â  change the definition of a sequence generator.

**Synopsis**

```text
ALTER SEQUENCE <name> [ INCREMENT BY <increment> ]
  [ MINVALUE <minvalue> ] [ MAXVALUE <maxvalue> ]
  [ CACHE <cache> | NOCACHE ] [ CYCLE ]
```

**Description**

`ALTER SEQUENCE` changes the parameters of an existing sequence generator. Any parameter not specifically set in the `ALTER SEQUENCE` command retains its prior setting.

**Parameters**

`name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a sequence to be altered.

`increment`

 The clause `INCREMENT BY increment` is optional. A positive value will make an ascending sequence, a negative one a descending sequence. If unspecified, the old increment value will be maintained.

`minvalue`

 The optional clause `MINVALUE minvalue` determines the minimum value a sequence can generate. If not specified, the current minimum value will be maintained. Note that the key words, `NO MINVALUE`, may be used to set this behavior back to the defaults of 1 and -2<sup>63</sup>-1 for ascending and descending sequences, respectively, however, this term is not compatible with Oracle databases.

`maxvalue`

 The optional clause `MAXVALUE maxvalue` determines the maximum value for the sequence. If not specified, the current maximum value will be maintained. Note that the key words, `NO MAXVALUE`, may be used to set this behavior back to the defaults of 2<sup>63</sup>-1 and -1 for ascending and descending sequences, respectively, however, this term is not compatible with Oracle databases.

`cache`

 The optional clause `CACHE cache` specifies how many sequence numbers are to be preallocated and stored in memory for faster access. The minimum value is `1` (only one value can be generated at a time, i.e., `NOCACHE`). If unspecified, the old cache value will be maintained.

`CYCLE`

 The `CYCLE` option allows the sequence to wrap around when the `maxvalue` or `minvalue` has been reached by an ascending or descending sequence respectively. If the limit is reached, the next number generated will be the `minvalue` or `maxvalue`, respectively. If not specified, the old cycle behavior will be maintained. Note that the key words, `NO CYCLE`, may be used to alter the sequence so that it does not recycle, however, this term is not compatible with Oracle databases.

**Notes**

To avoid blocking of concurrent transactions that obtain numbers from the same sequence, `ALTER SEQUENCE` is never rolled back; the changes take effect immediately and are not reversible.

`ALTER SEQUENCE` will not immediately affect `NEXTVAL` results in backends, other than the current one, that have pre-allocated (cached) sequence values. They will use up all cached values prior to noticing the changed sequence parameters. The current backend will be affected immediately.

**Examples**

Change the increment and cache value of sequence, `serial`.

```text
ALTER SEQUENCE serial INCREMENT BY 2 CACHE 5;
```
