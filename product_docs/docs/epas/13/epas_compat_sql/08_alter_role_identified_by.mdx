**Name**

`ALTER ROLE` - change the password associated with a database role

**Synopsis**

``` text
ALTER ROLE <role_name> IDENTIFIED BY <password>
          [REPLACE <prev_password>]
```

**Description**

A role without the `CREATEROLE` privilege may use this command to change their own password. An unprivileged role must include the `REPLACE` clause and their previous password if `PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION` is not `NULL`<span class="title-ref"> in their profile. When the </span><span class="title-ref">REPLACE</span>\` clause is used by a non-superuser, the server will compare the password provided to the existing password and raise an error if the passwords do not match.

A database superuser can use this command to change the password associated with any role. If a superuser includes the `REPLACE` clause, the clause is ignored; a non-matching value for the previous password will not throw an error.

If the role for which the password is being changed has the `SUPERUSER` attribute, then a superuser must issue this command. A role with the `CREATEROLE` attribute can use this command to change the password associated with a role that is not a superuser.

**Parameters**

`role_name`

> The name of the role whose password is to be altered.

`password`

> The role’s new password.

`prev_password`

> The role’s previous password.

**Examples**

To change a role’s password:

``` text
ALTER ROLE john IDENTIFIED BY xyRP35z REPLACE 23PJ74a;
```
