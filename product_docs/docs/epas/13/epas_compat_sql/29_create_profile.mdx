**Name**

`CREATE PROFILE` -- create a new profile.

**Synopsis**

```text
CREATE PROFILE <profile_name>
       [LIMIT {<parameter value>} ... ];
```

**Description**

`CREATE PROFILE` creates a new profile. Include the `LIMIT` clause and one or more space-delimited `parameter/value` pairs to specify the rules enforced by Advanced Server.

Advanced Server creates a default profile named `DEFAULT`. When you use the `CREATE ROLE` command to create a new role, the new role is automatically associated with the `DEFAULT` profile. If you upgrade from a previous version of Advanced Server to Advanced Server 10, the upgrade process will automatically create the roles in the upgraded version to the `DEFAULT` profile.

You must be a superuser to use `CREATE PROFILE`.

Include the `LIMIT` clause and one or more space-delimited `parameter/value` pairs to specify the rules enforced by Advanced Server.

**Parameters**

`profile_name`

 The name of the profile.

`parameter`

 The password attribute that will be monitored by the rule.

`value`

 The value the `parameter` must reach before an action is taken by the server.

Advanced Server supports the `value` shown below for each `parameter`:

`FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` specifies the number of failed login attempts that a user may make before the server locks the user out of their account for the length of time specified by `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME`. Supported values are:

-   An `INTEGER` value greater than `0`.
-   `DEFAULT` - the value of `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS` specified in the `DEFAULT` profile.
-   `UNLIMITED` – the connecting user may make an unlimited number of failed login attempts.

`PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` specifies the length of time that must pass before the server unlocks an account that has been locked because of `FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS`. Supported values are:

-   A `NUMERIC` value greater than or equal to `0`. To specify a fractional portion of a day, specify a decimal value. For example, use the value `4.5` to specify `4` days, `12` hours.
-   `DEFAULT` - the value of `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` specified in the `DEFAULT` profile.
-   `UNLIMITED` – the account is locked until it is manually unlocked by a database superuser.

`PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME` specifies the number of days that the current password may be used before the user is prompted to provide a new password. Include the `PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME` clause when using the `PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME` clause to specify the number of days that will pass after the password expires before connections by the role are rejected. If `PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME` is not specified, the password will expire on the day specified by the default value of `PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME`, and the user will not be allowed to execute any command until a new password is provided. Supported values are:

-   A `NUMERIC` value greater than or equal to `0`. To specify a fractional portion of a day, specify a decimal value. For example, use the value `4.5` to specify `4` days, `12` hours.
-   `DEFAULT` - the value of `PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME` specified in the `DEFAULT` profile.
-   `UNLIMITED` – The password does not have an expiration date.

`PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME` specifies the length of the grace period after a password expires until the user is forced to change their password. When the grace period expires, a user will be allowed to connect, but will not be allowed to execute any command until they update their expired password. Supported values are:

-   A `NUMERIC` value greater than or equal to 0. To specify a fractional portion of a day, specify a decimal value. For example, use the value `4.5` to specify `4` days, `12` hours.
-   `DEFAULT` - the value of `PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME` specified in the `DEFAULT` profile.
-   `UNLIMITED` – The grace period is infinite.

`PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME` specifies the number of days a user must wait before re-using a password. The `PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME` and `PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX` parameters are intended to be used together. If you specify a finite value for one of these parameters while the other is `UNLIMITED`, old passwords can never be reused. If both parameters are set to `UNLIMITED` there are no restrictions on password reuse. Supported values are:

-   A `NUMERIC` value greater than or equal to `0`. To specify a fractional portion of a day, specify a decimal value. For example, use the value `4.5` to specify `4` days, `12` hours.
-   `DEFAULT` - the value of `PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME` specified in the `DEFAULT` profile.
-   `UNLIMITED` – The password can be re-used without restrictions.

`PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX` specifies the number of password changes that must occur before a password can be reused. The `PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME` and `PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX` parameters are intended to be used together. If you specify a finite value for one of these parameters while the other is `UNLIMITED`, old passwords can never be reused. If both parameters are set to `UNLIMITED` there are no restrictions on password reuse. Supported values are:

-   An `INTEGER` value greater than or equal to `0`.
-   `DEFAULT` - the value of `PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX` specified in the `DEFAULT` profile.
-   `UNLIMITED` – The password can be re-used without restrictions.

`PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION` specifies password complexity. Supported values are:

-   The name of a PL/SQL function.
-   `DEFAULT` - the value of `PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION` specified in the `DEFAULT` profile.
-   `NULL`

`PASSWORD_ALLOW_HASHED` specifies whether an encrypted password to be allowed for use or not. If you specify the value as `TRUE`, the system allows a user to change the password by specifying a hash computed encrypted password on the client side. However, if you specify the value as `FALSE`, then a password must be specified in a plain-text form in order to be validated effectively, else an error will be thrown if a server receives an encrypted password. Supported values are:

-   A `BOOLEAN` value `TRUE/ON/YES/1` or `FALSE/OFF/NO/0`.
-   `DEFAULT` – the value of `PASSWORD_ALLOW_HASHED` specified in the `DEFAULT` profile.

!!! Note
    The `PASSWORD_ALLOW_HASHED` is not an Oracle-compatible parameter.

**Notes**

Use `DROP PROFILE` command to remove the profile.

**Examples**

The following command creates a profile named `acctg`. The profile specifies that if a user has not authenticated with the correct password in five attempts, the account will be locked for one day:

```text
CREATE PROFILE acctg LIMIT
       FAILED_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS 5
       PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME 1;
```

The following command creates a profile named `sales`. The profile specifies that a user must change their password every 90 days:

```text
CREATE PROFILE sales LIMIT
       PASSWORD_LIFE_TIME 90
       PASSWORD_GRACE_TIME 3;
```

If the user has not changed their password before the 90 days specified in the profile has passed, they will be issued a warning at login. After a grace period of 3 days, their account will not be allowed to invoke any commands until they change their password.

The following command creates a profile named `accts`. The profile specifies that a user cannot re-use a password within 180 days of the last use of the password, and must change their password at least 5 times before re-using the password:

```text
CREATE PROFILE accts LIMIT
       PASSWORD_REUSE_TIME 180
       PASSWORD_REUSE_MAX 5;
```

The following command creates a profile named `resources`; the profile calls a user-defined function named `password_rules` that will verify that the password provided meets their standards for complexity:

```text
CREATE PROFILE resources LIMIT
       PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION password_rules;
```
