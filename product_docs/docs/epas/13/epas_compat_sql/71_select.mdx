```

**Description**

`SELECT` retrieves rows from one or more tables. The general processing of `SELECT` is as follows:

1.  All elements in the `FROM` list are computed. (Each element in the `FROM` list is a real or virtual table.) If more than one element is specified in the `FROM` list, they are cross-joined together. (See `FROM` clause, below.)
2.  If the `WHERE` clause is specified, all rows that do not satisfy the condition are eliminated from the output. (See `WHERE` clause, below.)
3.  If the `GROUP BY` clause is specified, the output is divided into groups of rows that match on one or more values. If the `HAVING` clause is present, it eliminates groups that do not satisfy the given condition. (See `GROUP BY` clause and `HAVING` clause below.)
4.  Using the operators `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `MINUS`, the output of more than one `SELECT` statement can be combined to form a single result set. The `UNION` operator returns all rows that are in one or both of the result sets. The `INTERSECT` operator returns all rows that are strictly in both result sets. The `MINUS` operator returns the rows that are in the first result set but not in the second. In all three cases, duplicate rows are eliminated. In the case of the `UNION` operator, if `ALL` is specified then duplicates are not eliminated. (See `UNION` clause, `INTERSECT` clause, and `MINUS` clause below.)
5.  The actual output rows are computed using the `SELECT` output expressions for each selected row. (See `SELECT` list below.)
6.  The `CONNECT BY` clause is used to select data that has a hierarchical relationship. Such data has a parent-child relationship between rows. (See `CONNECT BY` clause.)
7.  If the `ORDER BY` clause is specified, the returned rows are sorted in the specified order. If `ORDER BY` is not given, the rows are returned in whatever order the system finds fastest to produce. (See `ORDER BY clause` below.)
8.  `DISTINCT | UNIQUE` eliminates duplicate rows from the result. `ALL` (the default) will return all candidate rows, including duplicates. (See `DISTINCT | UNIQUE` clause below.)
9.  The `FOR UPDATE` clause causes the `SELECT` statement to lock the selected rows against concurrent updates. (See `FOR UPDATE` clause below.)

You must have `SELECT` privilege on a table to read its values. The use of `FOR UPDATE` requires `UPDATE` privilege as well.

**Parameters**

`optimizer_hint`

 Comment-embedded hints to the optimizer for selection of an execution plan. See Functions and Operators of *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Reference Guide* for information about optimizer hints.

## FROM Clause

The `FROM` clause specifies one or more source tables for a `SELECT` statement. The syntax is:

```text
FROM source [, ...]
```

Where `source` can be one of following elements:

`table_name[@dblink ]`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing table or view. `dblink` is a database link name identifying a remote database. See the `CREATE DATABASE LINK` command for information on database links.

`alias`

 A substitute name for the `FROM` item containing the alias. An alias is used for brevity or to eliminate ambiguity for self-joins (where the same table is scanned multiple times). When an alias is provided, it completely hides the actual name of the table or function; for example given `FROM foo AS f`, the remainder of the `SELECT` must refer to this `FROM` item as `f` not `foo`.

`select`

 A sub-`SELECT` can appear in the `FROM` clause. This acts as though its output were created as a temporary table for the duration of this single `SELECT` command. Note that the sub-`SELECT` must be surrounded by parentheses, and an alias must be provided for it.

`join_type`

 One of the following:

 `[ INNER ] JOIN`

 `LEFT [ OUTER ] JOIN`

 `RIGHT [ OUTER ] JOIN`

 `FULL [ OUTER ] JOIN`

 `CROSS JOIN`

 For the `INNER` and `OUTER` join types, a join condition must be specified, namely exactly one of `NATURAL`, `ON join_condition`, or `USING (join_column [, ...] )`. See below for the meaning. For `CROSS JOIN`, none of these clauses may appear.

 A `JOIN` clause combines two `FROM` items. Use parentheses if necessary to determine the order of nesting. In the absence of parentheses, `JOINs` nest left-to-right. In any case `JOIN` binds more tightly than the commas separating `FROM` items.

 `CROSS JOIN` and `INNER JOIN` produce a simple Cartesian product, the same result as you get from listing the two items at the top level of `FROM`, but restricted by the join condition (if any). `CROSS JOIN` is equivalent to `INNER JOIN ON (TRUE)`, that is, no rows are removed by qualification. These join types are just a notational convenience, since they do nothing you couldn’t do with plain `FROM` and `WHERE`.

 `LEFT OUTER JOIN` returns all rows in the qualified Cartesian product (i.e., all combined rows that pass its join condition), plus one copy of each row in the left-hand table for which there was no right-hand row that passed the join condition. This left-hand row is extended to the full width of the joined table by inserting null values for the right-hand columns. Note that only the `JOIN` clause’s own condition is considered while deciding which rows have matches. Outer conditions are applied afterwards.

 Conversely, `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` returns all the joined rows, plus one row for each unmatched right-hand row (extended with nulls on the left). This is just a notational convenience, since you could convert it to a `LEFT OUTER JOIN` by switching the left and right inputs.

 `FULL OUTER JOIN` returns all the joined rows, plus one row for each unmatched left-hand row (extended with nulls on the right), plus one row for each unmatched right-hand row (extended with nulls on the left).

`ON join_condition`

 `join_condition` is an expression resulting in a value of type `BOOLEAN` (similar to a `WHERE` clause) that specifies which rows in a join are considered to match.

`USING (join_column [, ...] )`

 A clause of the form `USING (a, b, ... )` is shorthand for `ON left_table.a = right_table.a AND left_table.b = right_table.b ....` Also, `USING` implies that only one of each pair of equivalent columns will be included in the join output, not both.

`NATURAL`

 `NATURAL` is shorthand for a `USING` list that mentions all columns in the two tables that have the same names.

If multiple sources are specified, the result is the Cartesian product (cross join) of all the sources. Usually qualification conditions are added to restrict the returned rows to a small subset of the Cartesian product.

**Example**

The following example selects all of the entries from the `dept` table:

```text
SELECT * FROM dept;
deptno |  dname      |  loc
-------+-------------+-----------
    10 |  ACCOUNTING |  NEW YORK
    20 |  RESEARCH   |  DALLAS
    30 |  SALES      |  CHICAGO
    40 | OPERATIONS  |  BOSTON
 (4 rows)
```

## WHERE Clause

The optional `WHERE` clause has the form:

```text
WHERE condition
```

where `condition` is any expression that evaluates to a result of type `BOOLEAN`. Any row that does not satisfy this condition will be eliminated from the output. A row satisfies the condition if it returns `TRUE` when the actual row values are substituted for any variable references.

**Example**

The following example joins the contents of the `emp` and `dept` tables, `WHERE` the value of the `deptno` column in the `emp` table is equal to the value of the `deptno` column in the `deptno` table:

```text
SELECT d.deptno, d.dname, e.empno, e.ename, e.mgr, e.hiredate
    FROM emp e, dept d
    WHERE d.deptno = e.deptno;

 deptno |   dname    | empno | ename  | mgr  |      hiredate

     30 | SALES      |  7900 | JAMES  | 7698 | 03-DEC-81 00:00:00
(14 rows)
```

## GROUP BY Clause

The optional `GROUP BY` clause has the form:

```text
GROUP BY { expression | ROLLUP ( expr_list ) |
  CUBE ( expr_list ) | GROUPING SETS ( expr_list ) } [, ...]
```

`GROUP BY` will condense into a single row all selected rows that share the same values for the grouped expressions. `expression` can be an input column name, or the name or ordinal number of an output column (`SELECT` list item), or an arbitrary expression formed from input-column values. In case of ambiguity, a `GROUP BY` name will be interpreted as an input-column name rather than an output column name.

`ROLLUP`, `CUBE`, and `GROUPING SETS` are extensions to the `GROUP BY` clause for supporting multidimensional analysis.

Aggregate functions, if any are used, are computed across all rows making up each group, producing a separate value for each group (whereas without `GROUP BY`, an aggregate produces a single value computed across all the selected rows). When `GROUP BY` is present, it is not valid for the `SELECT` list expressions to refer to ungrouped columns except within aggregate functions, since there would be more than one possible value to return for an ungrouped column.

**Example**

The following example computes the sum of the `sal` column in the `emp` table, grouping the results by department number:

```text
SELECT deptno, SUM(sal) AS total
    FROM emp
    GROUP BY deptno;

 deptno |  total
--------+----------
     10 |  8750.00
     20 | 10875.00
     30 |  9400.00
(3 rows)
```

## HAVING Clause

The optional `HAVING` clause has the form:

```text
HAVING condition
```

where `condition` is the same as specified for the `WHERE` clause.

`HAVING` eliminates group rows that do not satisfy the specified condition. `HAVING` is different from `WHERE; WHERE` filters individual rows before the application of `GROUP BY`, while `HAVING` filters group rows created by `GROUP BY`. Each column referenced in condition must unambiguously reference a grouping column, unless the reference appears within an aggregate function.

**Example**

To sum the column, `sal` of all employees, group the results by department number and show those group totals that are less than 10000:

```text
SELECT deptno, SUM(sal) AS total
    FROM emp
    GROUP BY deptno
    HAVING SUM(sal) < 10000;

 deptno |  total
--------+---------
     10 | 8750.00
     30 | 9400.00
(2 rows)
```

## SELECT List

The `SELECT` list (between the key words `SELECT` and `FROM`) specifies expressions that form the output rows of the `SELECT` statement. The expressions can (and usually do) refer to columns computed in the `FROM` clause. Using the clause `AS output_name`, another name can be specified for an output column. This name is primarily used to label the column for display. It can also be used to refer to the column’s value in `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` clauses, but not in the `WHERE` or `HAVING` clauses; there you must write out the expression instead.

Instead of an expression, \* can be written in the output list as a shorthand for all the columns of the selected rows.

**Example**

The `SELECT` list in the following example specifies that the result set should include the `empno` column, the `ename` column, the `mgr` column and the `hiredate` column:

```text
SELECT empno, ename, mgr, hiredate FROM emp;

 empno | ename  | mgr  |      hiredate
-------+--------+------+--------------------
  7934 | MILLER | 7782 | 23-JAN-82 00:00:00
  7782 | CLARK  | 7839 | 09-JUN-81 00:00:00
  7839 | KING   |      | 17-NOV-81 00:00:00
  7788 | SCOTT  | 7566 | 19-APR-87 00:00:00
  7566 | JONES  | 7839 | 02-APR-81 00:00:00
  7369 | SMITH  | 7902 | 17-DEC-80 00:00:00
  7876 | ADAMS  | 7788 | 23-MAY-87 00:00:00
  7902 | FORD   | 7566 | 03-DEC-81 00:00:00
  7521 | WARD   | 7698 | 22-FEB-81 00:00:00
  7844 | TURNER | 7698 | 08-SEP-81 00:00:00
  7499 | ALLEN  | 7698 | 20-FEB-81 00:00:00
  7698 | BLAKE  | 7839 | 01-MAY-81 00:00:00
  7654 | MARTIN | 7698 | 28-SEP-81 00:00:00
  7900 | JAMES  | 7698 | 03-DEC-81 00:00:00
(14 rows)
```

## UNION Clause

The `UNION` clause has the form:

```text
select_statement UNION [ ALL ] select_statement
```

`select_statement` is any `SELECT` statement without an `ORDER BY` or `FOR UPDATE` clause. (`ORDER BY` can be attached to a sub-expression if it is enclosed in parentheses. Without parentheses, these clauses will be taken to apply to the result of the `UNION`, not to its right-hand input expression.)

The `UNION` operator computes the set union of the rows returned by the involved `SELECT` statements. A row is in the set union of two result sets if it appears in at least one of the result sets. The two `SELECT` statements that represent the direct operands of the `UNION` must produce the same number of columns, and corresponding columns must be of compatible data types.

The result of `UNION` does not contain any duplicate rows unless the `ALL` option is specified. `ALL` prevents elimination of duplicates.

Multiple `UNION` operators in the same `SELECT` statement are evaluated left to right, unless otherwise indicated by parentheses.

Currently, `FOR UPDATE` may not be specified either for a `UNION` result or for any input of a `UNION`.

## INTERSECT Clause

The `INTERSECT` clause has the form:

```text
select_statement INTERSECT select_statement
```

`select_statement` is any `SELECT` statement without an `ORDER BY` or `FOR UPDATE` clause.

The `INTERSECT` operator computes the set intersection of the rows returned by the involved `SELECT` statements. A row is in the intersection of two result sets if it appears in both result sets.

The result of `INTERSECT` does not contain any duplicate rows.

Multiple `INTERSECT` operators in the same `SELECT` statement are evaluated left to right, unless parentheses dictate otherwise. `INTERSECT` binds more tightly than `UNION`. That is, `A UNION B INTERSECT C` will be read as `A UNION (B INTERSECT C)`.

## MINUS Clause

The `MINUS` clause has this general form:

```text
select_statement MINUS select_statement
```

`select_statement` is any `SELECT` statement without an `ORDER BY` or `FOR UPDATE` clause.

The `MINUS` operator computes the set of rows that are in the result of the left `SELECT` statement but not in the result of the right one.

The result of `MINUS` does not contain any duplicate rows.

Multiple `MINUS` operators in the same `SELECT` statement are evaluated left to right, unless parentheses dictate otherwise. `MINUS` binds at the same level as `UNION`.

## CONNECT BY Clause

The `CONNECT BY` clause determines the parent-child relationship of rows when performing a hierarchical query. It has the general form:

```text
CONNECT BY { PRIOR parent_expr = child_expr |
  child_expr = PRIOR parent_expr }
```

`parent_expr` is evaluated on a candidate parent row. If `parent_expr = child_expr` results in `TRUE` for a row returned by the `FROM` clause, then this row is considered a child of the parent.

The following optional clauses may be specified in conjunction with the `CONNECT BY` clause:

`START WITH start_expression`

 The rows returned by the `FROM` clause on which `start_expression` evaluates to `TRUE` become the root nodes of the hierarchy.

`ORDER SIBLINGS BY expression [ ASC | DESC ] [, ...]`

 Sibling rows of the hierarchy are ordered by `expression` in the result set.

!!! Note
    Advanced Server does not support the use of `AND` (or other operators) in the `CONNECT BY` clause.

## ORDER BY Clause

The optional `ORDER BY` clause has the form:

```text
ORDER BY expression [ ASC | DESC ] [, ...]
```

`expression` can be the name or ordinal number of an output column (`SELECT` list item), or it can be an arbitrary expression formed from input-column values.

The `ORDER BY` clause causes the result rows to be sorted according to the specified expressions. If two rows are equal according to the leftmost expression, they are compared according to the next expression and so on. If they are equal according to all specified expressions, they are returned in an implementation-dependent order.

The ordinal number refers to the ordinal (left-to-right) position of the result column. This feature makes it possible to define an ordering on the basis of a column that does not have a unique name. This is never absolutely necessary because it is always possible to assign a name to a result column using the `AS` clause.

It is also possible to use arbitrary expressions in the `ORDER BY` clause, including columns that do not appear in the `SELECT` result list. Thus the following statement is valid:

```text
SELECT ename FROM emp ORDER BY empno;
```

A limitation of this feature is that an `ORDER BY` clause applying to the result of a `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, or `MINUS` clause may only specify an output column name or number, not an expression.

If an `ORDER BY` expression is a simple name that matches both a result column name and an input column name, `ORDER BY` will interpret it as the result column name. This is the opposite of the choice that `GROUP BY` will make in the same situation. This inconsistency is made to be compatible with the SQL standard.

Optionally one may add the key word `ASC` (ascending) or `DESC` (descending) after any expression in the `ORDER BY` clause. If not specified, `ASC` is assumed by default.

The null value sorts higher than any other value. In other words, with ascending sort order, null values sort at the end, and with descending sort order, null values sort at the beginning.

Character-string data is sorted according to the locale-specific collation order that was established when the database cluster was initialized.

!!! Note
    If `SELECT DISTINCT` is specified or if a `SELECT` statement includes the `SELECT DISTINCT ...ORDER BY` clause then all the expressions in `ORDER BY` must be present in the select list of the `SELECT DISTINCT` query.

**Examples**

The following two examples are identical ways of sorting the individual results according to the contents of the second column (`dname`):

```text
SELECT * FROM dept ORDER BY dname;

 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
(4 rows)

SELECT * FROM dept ORDER BY 2;

 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
(4 rows)
```

The following example uses the `SELECT DISTINCT ...ORDER BY` clause to fetch the `job` and `deptno` from table `emp`:

```text
CREATE TABLE EMP(EMPNO NUMBER(4) NOT NULL,
ENAME VARCHAR2(10),
JOB VARCHAR2(9),
DEPTNO NUMBER(2));
```

```text
INSERT INTO EMP VALUES (7369, 'SMITH', 'CLERK', 20);
INSERT 0 1
INSERT INTO EMP VALUES (7499, 'ALLEN', 'SALESMAN', 30);
INSERT 0 1
INSERT INTO EMP VALUES (7521, 'WARD', 'SALESMAN', 30);
INSERT 0 1
INSERT INTO EMP VALUES (7566, 'JONES', 'MANAGER', 20);
INSERT 0 1
```

```text
SELECT DISTINCT e.job, e.deptno FROM emp e ORDER BY e.job, e.deptno;
 job      | deptno
----------+--------
 CLERK    |     20
 MANAGER  |     20
 SALESMAN |     30
(3 rows)
```

## DISTINCT | UNIQUE Clause

If a `SELECT` statement specifies `DISTINCT` or `UNIQUE`, all duplicate rows are removed from the result set (one row is kept from each group of duplicates). The `DISTINCT` or `UNIQUE` clause are synonymous when used with a `SELECT` statement. The `ALL` keyword specifies the opposite: all rows are kept; that is the default.

Error messages resulting from the improper use of a `SELECT` statement that includes the `DISTINCT` or `UNIQUE` keywords will include both the `DISTINCT | UNIQUE` keywords as shown below:

```text
psql: ERROR: FOR UPDATE is not allowed with DISTINCT/UNIQUE clause
```

## FOR UPDATE Clause

The `FOR UPDATE` clause takes the form:

```text
FOR UPDATE [WAIT n|NOWAIT|SKIP LOCKED]
```

`FOR UPDATE` causes the rows retrieved by the `SELECT` statement to be locked as though for update. This prevents a row from being modified or deleted by other transactions until the current transaction ends; any transaction that attempts to `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `SELECT FOR UPDATE` a selected row will be blocked until the current transaction ends. If an `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `SELECT FOR UPDATE` from another transaction has already locked a selected row or rows, `SELECT FOR UPDATE` will wait for the first transaction to complete, and will then lock and return the updated row (or no row, if the row was deleted).

`FOR UPDATE` cannot be used in contexts where returned rows cannot be clearly identified with individual table rows (for example, with aggregation).

Use `FOR UPDATE` options to specify locking preferences:

-   Include the `WAIT n` keywords to specify the number of seconds (or fractional seconds) that the `SELECT` statement will wait for a row locked by another session. Use a decimal form to specify fractional seconds; for example, `WAIT 1.5` instructs the server to wait one and a half seconds. Specify up to `4` digits to the right of the decimal.
-   Include the `NOWAIT` keyword to report an error immediately if a row cannot be locked by the current session.
-   Include `SKIP LOCKED` to instruct the server to lock rows if possible, and skip rows that are already locked by another session.
