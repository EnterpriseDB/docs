**Name**

`ALTER TABLE` -- change the definition of a table.

**Synopsis**

```text
ALTER TABLE <name>
  action [, ...]
ALTER TABLE <name>
  RENAME COLUMN <column> TO <new_column>
ALTER TABLE <name>
  RENAME TO <new_name>
ALTER TABLE <name>
  { NOPARALLEL | PARALLEL [ <integer> ] }
```

where `action` is one of:

```text
ADD <column type> [ column_constraint [ ... ] ]
DROP COLUMN <column>
ADD <table_constraint>
DROP CONSTRAINT <constraint_name> [ CASCADE ]
```

**Description**

`ALTER TABLE` changes the definition of an existing table. There are several subforms:

-   `ADD column type`

    This form adds a new column to the table using the same syntax as `CREATE TABLE`.

-   `DROP COLUMN`

    This form drops a column from a table. Indexes and table constraints involving the column will be automatically dropped as well.

-   `ADD table_constraint`

    This form adds a new constraint to a table; for details, see [CREATE TABLE](36_create_table/#create_table).

-   `DROP CONSTRAINT`

    This form drops constraints on a table. Currently, constraints on tables are not required to have unique names, so there may be more than one constraint matching the specified name. All matching constraints will be dropped.

`RENAME`

 The `RENAME` forms change the name of a table (or an index, sequence, or view) or the name of an individual column in a table. There is no effect on the stored data.

The `PARALLEL` clause sets the degree of parallelism for a table. The `NOPARALLEL` clause resets the values to their defaults; `reloptions` will show the `parallel_workers` parameter as `0`.

A superuser has permission to create a trigger on any user's table but a user can create a trigger only on the table they own. However, when the ownership of a table is changed, the ownership of the trigger's implicit objects is updated when they are matched with a table owner owning a trigger.

You can use `ALTER TRIGGER ...ON AUTHORIZATION` command to alter a trigger's implicit object owner, for information, see [ALTER TRIGGER](13_alter_trigger/#alter_trigger).

You must own the table to use `ALTER TABLE`.

**Parameters**

`name`

 The name (possibly schema-qualified) of an existing table to alter.

`column`

 Name of a new or existing column.

`new_column`

 New name for an existing column.

`new_name`

 New name for the table.

`type`

 Data type of the new column.

`table_constraint`

 New table constraint for the table.

`constraint_name`

 Name of an existing constraint to drop.

`CASCADE`

 Automatically drop objects that depend on the dropped constraint.

`PARALLEL`

 Specify `PARALLEL` to select a degree of parallelism; you can also specify the degree of parallelism by setting the `parallel_workers` parameter when performing a parallel scan on a table. If you specify `PARALLEL` without including a degree of parallelism, the index will use default parallelism.

`NOPARALLEL`

 Specify `NOPARALLEL` to reset parallelism to default values.

`integer`

 The `integer` indicates the degree of parallelism, which is the number of `parallel_workers` used in the parallel operation to perform a parallel scan on a table.

**Notes**

When you invoke `ADD COLUMN`, all existing rows in the table are initialized with the columnâ€™s default value (null if no `DEFAULT` clause is specified). Adding a column with a non-null default will require the entire table to be rewritten. This may take a significant amount of time for a large table; and it will temporarily require double the disk space. Adding a `CHECK` or `NOT NULL` constraint requires scanning the table to verify that existing rows meet the constraint.

The `DROP COLUMN` form does not physically remove the column, but simply makes it invisible to SQL operations. Subsequent insert and update operations in the table will store a null value for the column. Thus, dropping a column is quick but it will not immediately reduce the on-disk size of your table, as the space occupied by the dropped column is not reclaimed. The space will be reclaimed over time as existing rows are updated.

Changing any part of a system catalog table is not permitted. Refer to [CREATE TABLE](36_create_table/#create_table) for a further description of valid parameters.

**Examples**

To add a column of type `VARCHAR2` to a table:

```text
ALTER TABLE emp ADD address VARCHAR2(30);
```

To drop a column from a table:

```text
ALTER TABLE emp DROP COLUMN address;
```

To rename an existing column:

```text
ALTER TABLE emp RENAME COLUMN address TO city;
```

To rename an existing table:

```text
ALTER TABLE emp RENAME TO employee;
```

To add a check constraint to a table:

```text
ALTER TABLE emp ADD CONSTRAINT sal_chk CHECK (sal > 500);
```

To remove a check constraint from a table:

```text
ALTER TABLE emp DROP CONSTRAINT sal_chk;
```

To reset the degree of parallelism to 0 on the `emp` table:

```text
ALTER TABLE emp NOPARALLEL;
```

The following example creates a table named `dept`, and then alters the `dept` table to define and enable a unique key on the `dname` column. The constraint `dept_dname_uq` identifies the `dname` column as a unique key. The `USING_INDEX` clause creates an index on a table `dept` with the index statement specified to enable the unique constraint.

```text
CREATE TABLE dept (
   deptno          NUMBER(2),
   dname           VARCHAR2(14),
   loc             VARCHAR2(13)
);
```

```text
ALTER TABLE dept
  ADD CONSTRAINT dept_dname_uq UNIQUE(dname)
     USING INDEX (CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_dept_dname_uq ON dept (dname));
```

The following example creates a table named `emp`, and then alters the `emp` table to define and enable a primary key on the `ename` column. The `emp_ename_pk` constraint identifies the column `ename` as a primary key of the `emp` table. The `USING_INDEX` clause creates an index on a table `emp` with the index statement specified to enable the primary constraint.

```text
CREATE TABLE emp (
   empno           NUMBER(4) NOT NULL,
   ename           VARCHAR2(10),
   job             VARCHAR2(9),
   sal             NUMBER(7,2),
   deptno          NUMBER(2)
);
```

```text
ALTER TABLE emp
  ADD CONSTRAINT emp_ename_pk PRIMARY KEY (ename)
     USING INDEX (CREATE INDEX idx_emp_ename_pk ON emp (ename));
```
