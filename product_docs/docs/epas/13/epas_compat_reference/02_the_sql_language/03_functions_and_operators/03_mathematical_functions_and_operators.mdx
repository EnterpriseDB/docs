Mathematical operators are provided for many Advanced Server types. For types without common mathematical conventions for all possible permutations (e.g., date/time types) the actual behavior is described in subsequent sections.

The following table shows the available mathematical operators:

| Operator | Description                       | Example  | Result |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| `+`      | Addition                          | `2 + 3`  | `5`    |
| `-`      | Subtraction                       | `2 – 3`  | `-1`   |
| `*`      | Multiplication                    | `2 * 3`  | `6`    |
| `/`      | Division (See the following note) | `4 / 2`  | `2`    |
| `**`     | Exponentiation Operator           | `2 ** 3` | `8`    |

!!! Note
    If the `db_dialect` configuration parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file is set to `redwood`, then division of a pair of `INTEGER` data types does not result in a truncated value. Any fractional result is retained as shown by the following example:

```text
edb=# SET db_dialect TO redwood;
SET
edb=# SHOW db_dialect;
 db_dialect
------------
 redwood
(1 row)

edb=# SELECT CAST('10' AS INTEGER) / CAST('3' AS INTEGER) FROM dual;
      ?column?
--------------------
 3.3333333333333333
(1 row)
```

This behavior is compatible with Oracle databases where there is no native `INTEGER` data type, and any `INTEGER` data type specification is internally converted to `NUMBER(38)`, which results in retaining any fractional result.

If the `db_dialect` configuration parameter is set to `postgres`, then division of a pair of `INTEGER` data types results in a truncated value as shown by the following example:

```text
edb=# SET db_dialect TO postgres;
SET
edb=# SHOW db_dialect;
 db_dialect
------------
 postgres
(1 row)

edb=# SELECT CAST('10' AS INTEGER) / CAST('3' AS INTEGER) FROM dual;
 ?column?
----------
        3
(1 row)
```

This behavior is compatible with PostgreSQL databases where division involving any pair of `INTEGER`, `SMALLINT`, or `BIGINT` data types results in truncation of the result. The same truncated result is returned by Advanced Server when `db_dialect` is set to `postgres` as shown in the previous example.

Note however, that even when `db_dialect` is set to `redwood`, only division with a pair of `INTEGER` data types results in no truncation of the result. Division that includes only `SMALLINT` or `BIGINT` data types, with or without an `INTEGER` data type, does result in truncation in the PostgreSQL fashion without retaining the fractional portion as shown by the following where `INTEGER` and `SMALLINT` are involved in the division:

```text
edb=# SHOW db_dialect;
 db_dialect
------------
 redwood
(1 row)

edb=# SELECT CAST('10' AS INTEGER) / CAST('3' AS SMALLINT) FROM dual;
 ?column?
----------
        3
(1 row)
```

The following table shows the available mathematical functions. Many of these functions are provided in multiple forms with different argument types. Except where noted, any given form of a function returns the same data type as its argument. The functions working with `DOUBLE PRECISION` data are mostly implemented on top of the host system’s C library; accuracy and behavior in boundary cases may therefore vary depending on the host system.
