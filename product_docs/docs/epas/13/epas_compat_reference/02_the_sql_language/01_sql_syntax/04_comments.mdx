<div id="comments" class="registered_link"></div>

A comment is an arbitrary sequence of characters beginning with double dashes and extending to the end of the line, e.g.:

`-- This is a standard SQL comment`

Alternatively, C-style block comments can be used:

```text
/* multiline comment
* block
*/
```

where the comment begins with /\* and extends to the matching occurrence of \*/.
