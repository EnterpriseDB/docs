You can use an RPM installer or a graphical installer to add EDB\*Plus to your Advanced Server installation.

## Installation Prerequisites

Before installing EDB\*Plus, you must first install Java (version 1.8 or later). On a Linux system, you can use the `yum` package manager to install Java. Open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    # yum -y install java
    ```

-   On RHEL or CentOS 8:

    ```text
    # dnf -y install java
    ```

If you are using Windows, Java installers and instructions are available online at:

 <http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp>

You must also have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

 <https://www.enterprisedb.com/user/login>

After receiving your repository credentials:

1.  Create the repository configuration file.
2.  Modify the file, providing your user name and password.
3.  Install EDB\*Plus.

For detailed information about creating and using EDB repositories to install Advanced Server or its supporting components, see the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server Installation Guide* available at:

[https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs](/epas/latest/)

## Installing EDB\*Plus on a CentOS Host

You can use an RPM package to install EDB\*Plus on a CentOS host.

-   To install the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges, and invoke one of the following platform-specific commands:

     On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

     On CentOS 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

-   Replace the `USERNAME:PASSWORD` variable in the following command with the username and password of a registered EDB user:

    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

-   Before installing EDB\*Plus, you must install the `epel-release` package:

     On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

     On CentOS 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
    ```

-   For CentOS 8, enable the PowerTools repository to satisfy package dependencies:

    ```text
    dnf config-manager --set-enabled PowerTools
    ```

-   The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`. After saving your changes to the configuration file, you can use the following command to install EDB\*Plus:

    On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-asxx-edbplus
    ```

    On CentOS 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install edb-asxx-edbplus
    ```

Where, `xx` is the Advanced Server version.

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, `yum` may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, `yum` may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

## Installing EDB\*Plus on a Debian or Ubuntu Host

To install EDB\*Plus on a Debian or Ubuntu host, you must have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, visit:

 <https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request>

The following steps will walk you through using the EDB apt repository to install a debian package. When using the commands, replace the `username` and `password` with the credentials provided by EDB.

-   Assume superuser privileges:

    ```text
    sudo su -
    ```

-   Configure the EDB repository:

     On Debian 9, Ubuntu 18, and Ubuntu 20:

    ```text
    sh -c 'echo "deb https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
    ```

     On Debian 10:

     a.  Set up the EDB repository:

    ```text
    sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
    ```

     b.  Substitute your EDB credentials for the `username` and `password` placeholders in the following command:

    ```text
    sh -c 'echo "machine apt.enterprisedb.com login <USERNAME> password <PASSWORD>" > /etc/apt/auth.conf.d/edb.conf'
    ```

-   Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

    ```text
    apt-get -y install apt-transport-https
    ```

-   Add the EDB signing key:

    ```text
    wget -q -O - https://apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key  | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

-   Update the repository metadata:

    ```text
    apt-get update
    ```

-   Install Debian package:

    ```text
    apt-get -y install edb-asxx-edbplus
    ```

Where, `xx` is the Advanced Server version.

## Configuring an RPM Installation

After performing an RPM installation of EDB\*Plus, you must set the values of environment variables that allow EDB\*Plus to locate your Java installation. Use the following commands to set variable values:

```text
export JAVA_HOME=<path_to_java>
export PATH=<path_to_java>/bin:$PATH
```

By default, the `pg_hba.conf` file for the RPM installer enforces `IDENT` authentication. Before invoking EDB\*Plus, you must either modify the `pg_hba.conf` file, changing the authentication method to a form other than `IDENT` (and restarting the server), or perform the following steps to ensure that an `IDENT` server is accessible:

You must confirm that an `identd` server is installed and running. You can use the `yum` package manager to install an `identd` server by invoking the command:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install xinetd authd
    ```

-   On RHEL or CentOS 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install xinetd authd
    ```

The command should create a file named `/etc/xinetd.d/auth` that contains:

```text
service auth
{
     disable = yes
     socket_type = stream
wait =no
user = ident
cps = 4096 10
instances = UNLIMITED
server = /usr/sbin/in.authd server_args = -t60 --xerror –os
}
```

!!! Note
    If the file includes a `-E` argument at the end of the server arguments, please erase `-E`.

Then, to start the `identd` server, invoke the following commands:

```text
systemctl enable xinetd
systemctl start xinetd
```

Open the `pg_ident.conf` file and create a user mapping:

```text
# map_name    system_username     postgres_username
  edbas         enterprisedb        enterprisedb
```

Where:

-   The name specified in the `map_name` column is a user-defined name that will identify the mapping in the `pg_hba.conf` file.
-   The name specified in the `system_username` column is `enterprisedb`.
-   The name specified in the `postgres_username` column is `enterprisedb`.

Then, open the `pg_hba.conf` file and modify the `IDENT` entries:

-   If you are using an IPv4 local connection, modify the file entry to read:

     `host all all 127.0.0.0/0 ident map=edbas`

-   If you are using an IPv6 local connection, modify the file entry to read:

     `host all all ::1/128 ident map=edbas`

You must restart the Advanced Server service before invoking EDB\*Plus. For detailed information about controlling the Advanced Server service, see the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server Installation Guide*, available at:

[https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs](/epas/latest/)
