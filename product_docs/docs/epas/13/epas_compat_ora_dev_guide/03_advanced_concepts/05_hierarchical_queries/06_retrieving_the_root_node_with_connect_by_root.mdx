`CONNECT_BY_ROOT` is a unary operator that can be used to qualify a column in order to return the columnâ€™s value of the row considered to be the root node in relation to the current row.

!!! Note
    A *unary operator* operates on a single operand, which in the case of `CONNECT_BY_ROOT`, is the column name following the `CONNECT_BY_ROOT` keyword.

In the context of the `SELECT` list, the `CONNECT_BY_ROOT` operator is shown by the following.

```text
SELECT [... ,] CONNECT_BY_ROOT <column> [, ...]
  FROM <table_expression> ...
```

The following are some points to note about the `CONNECT_BY_ROOT` operator.

-   The `CONNECT_BY_ROOT` operator can be used in the `SELECT` list, the `WHERE` clause, the `GROUP BY` clause, the `HAVING` clause, the `ORDER BY` clause, and the `ORDER SIBLINGS BY` clause as long as the `SELECT` command is for a hierarchical query.
-   The `CONNECT_BY_ROOT` operator cannot be used in the `CONNECT BY` clause or the `START WITH` clause of the hierarchical query.
-   It is possible to apply `CONNECT_BY_ROOT` to an expression involving a column, but to do so, the expression must be enclosed within parentheses.

The following query shows the use of the `CONNECT_BY_ROOT` operator to return the employee number and employee name of the root node for each employee listed in the result set based on trees starting with employees `BLAKE, CLARK`, and `JONES`.

```text
SELECT LEVEL, LPAD (' ', 2 * (LEVEL - 1)) || ename "employee", empno, mgr,
CONNECT_BY_ROOT empno "mgr empno",
CONNECT_BY_ROOT ename "mgr ename"
FROM emp
START WITH ename IN ('BLAKE','CLARK','JONES')
CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr
ORDER SIBLINGS BY ename ASC;
```

Note that the output from the query shows that all of the root nodes in columns `mgr empno` and `mgr ename` are one of the employees, `BLAKE, CLARK`, or `JONES`, listed in the `START WITH` clause.

```text
level | employee  | empno | mgr  | mgr empno | mgr ename
------+-----------+-------+------+-----------+-----------
  1   | BLAKE     |  7698 | 7839 |      7698 | BLAKE
  2   |   ALLEN   |  7499 | 7698 |      7698 | BLAKE
  2   |   JAMES   |  7900 | 7698 |      7698 | BLAKE
  2   |   MARTIN  |  7654 | 7698 |      7698 | BLAKE
  2   |   TURNER  |  7844 | 7698 |      7698 | BLAKE
  2   |   WARD    |  7521 | 7698 |      7698 | BLAKE
  1   | CLARK     |  7782 | 7839 |      7782 | CLARK
  2   |   MILLER  |  7934 | 7782 |      7782 | CLARK
  1   | JONES     |  7566 | 7839 |      7566 | JONES
  2   |   FORD    |  7902 | 7566 |      7566 | JONES
  3   |     SMITH |  7369 | 7902 |      7566 | JONES
  2   |   SCOTT   |  7788 | 7566 |      7566 | JONES
  3   |     ADAMS |  7876 | 7788 |      7566 | JONES
(13 rows)
```

The following is a similar query, but producing only one tree starting with the single, top-level, employee where the `mgr` column is null.

```text
SELECT LEVEL, LPAD (' ', 2 * (LEVEL - 1)) || ename "employee", empno, mgr,
CONNECT_BY_ROOT empno "mgr empno",
CONNECT_BY_ROOT ename "mgr ename"
FROM emp START WITH mgr IS NULL
CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr
ORDER SIBLINGS BY ename ASC;
```

In the following output, all of the root nodes in columns `mgr empno` and `mgr ename` indicate `KING` as the root for this particular query.

```text
level |  employee   | empno | mgr  | mgr empno | mgr ename
------+-------------+-------+------+-----------+-----------
    1 | KING        |  7839 |      |      7839 | KING
    2 |   BLAKE     |  7698 | 7839 |      7839 | KING
    3 |     ALLEN   |  7499 | 7698 |      7839 | KING
    3 |     JAMES   |  7900 | 7698 |      7839 | KING
    3 |     MARTIN  |  7654 | 7698 |      7839 | KING
    3 |     TURNER  |  7844 | 7698 |      7839 | KING
    3 |     WARD    |  7521 | 7698 |      7839 | KING
    2 |   CLARK     |  7782 | 7839 |      7839 | KING
    3 |     MILLER  |  7934 | 7782 |      7839 | KING
    2 |   JONES     |  7566 | 7839 |      7839 | KING
    3 |     FORD    |  7902 | 7566 |      7839 | KING
    4 |       SMITH |  7369 | 7902 |      7839 | KING
    3 |     SCOTT   |  7788 | 7566 |      7839 | KING
    4 |       ADAMS |  7876 | 7788 |      7839 | KING
(14 rows)
```

By contrast, the following example omits the `START WITH` clause thereby resulting in fourteen trees.

```text
SELECT LEVEL, LPAD (' ', 2 * (LEVEL - 1)) || ename "employee", empno, mgr,
CONNECT_BY_ROOT empno "mgr empno",
CONNECT_BY_ROOT ename "mgr ename"
FROM emp
CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr
ORDER SIBLINGS BY ename ASC;
```

The following is the output from the query. Each node appears at least once as a root node under the `mgr empno` and `mgr ename` columns since even the leaf nodes form the top of their own trees.

```text
level |  employee   | empno | mgr  | mgr empno | mgr ename
------+-------------+-------+------+-----------+-----------
    1 | ADAMS       |  7876 | 7788 |      7876 | ADAMS
    1 | ALLEN       |  7499 | 7698 |      7499 | ALLEN
    1 | BLAKE       |  7698 | 7839 |      7698 | BLAKE
    2 |   ALLEN     |  7499 | 7698 |      7698 | BLAKE
    2 |   JAMES     |  7900 | 7698 |      7698 | BLAKE
    2 |   MARTIN    |  7654 | 7698 |      7698 | BLAKE

The following illustrates the unary operator effect of `CONNECT_BY_ROOT`. As shown in this example, when applied to an expression that is not enclosed in parentheses, the `CONNECT_BY_ROOT` operator affects only the term, `ename`, immediately following it. The subsequent concatenation of `|| ' manages ' || ename` is not part of the `CONNECT_BY_ROOT` operation, hence the second occurrence of `ename` results in the value of the currently processed row while the first occurrence of `ename` results in the value from the root node.

```text
SELECT LEVEL, LPAD (' ', 2 * (LEVEL - 1)) || ename "employee", empno, mgr,
CONNECT_BY_ROOT ename || ' manages ' || ename "top mgr/employee"
FROM emp
START WITH ename IN ('BLAKE','CLARK','JONES')
CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr
ORDER SIBLINGS BY ename ASC;
```

The following is the output from the query. Note the values produced under the `top mgr/employee` column.

```text
level | employee  | empno | mgr  |   top mgr/employee
------+-----------+-------+------+----------------------
    1 | BLAKE     |  7698 | 7839 | BLAKE manages BLAKE
    2 |   ALLEN   |  7499 | 7698 | BLAKE manages ALLEN
    2 |   JAMES   |  7900 | 7698 | BLAKE manages JAMES
    2 |   MARTIN  |  7654 | 7698 | BLAKE manages MARTIN
    2 |   TURNER  |  7844 | 7698 | BLAKE manages TURNER
    2 |   WARD    |  7521 | 7698 | BLAKE manages WARD
    1 | CLARK     |  7782 | 7839 | CLARK manages CLARK
    2 |   MILLER  |  7934 | 7782 | CLARK manages MILLER
    1 | JONES     |  7566 | 7839 | JONES manages JONES
    2 |   FORD    |  7902 | 7566 | JONES manages FORD
    3 |     SMITH |  7369 | 7902 | JONES manages SMITH
    2 |   SCOTT   |  7788 | 7566 | JONES manages SCOTT
    3 |     ADAMS |  7876 | 7788 | JONES manages ADAMS
(13 rows)
```

The following example uses the `CONNECT_BY_ROOT` operator on an expression enclosed in parentheses.

```text
SELECT LEVEL, LPAD (' ', 2 * (LEVEL - 1)) || ename "employee", empno, mgr,
CONNECT_BY_ROOT ('Manager ' || ename || ' is emp # ' || empno)
"top mgr/empno"
FROM emp
START WITH ename IN ('BLAKE','CLARK','JONES')
CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr
ORDER SIBLINGS BY ename ASC;
```

The following is the output of the query. Note that the values of both `ename` and `empno` are affected by the `CONNECT_BY_ROOT` operator and as a result, return the values from the root node as shown under the `top mgr/empno` column.

```text
level | employee  | empno | mgr  |        top mgr/empno
------+-----------+-------+------+-----------------------------
    1 | BLAKE     |  7698 | 7839 | Manager BLAKE is emp # 7698
    2 |   ALLEN   |  7499 | 7698 | Manager BLAKE is emp # 7698
    2 |   JAMES   |  7900 | 7698 | Manager BLAKE is emp # 7698
    2 |   MARTIN  |  7654 | 7698 | Manager BLAKE is emp # 7698
    2 |   TURNER  |  7844 | 7698 | Manager BLAKE is emp # 7698
    2 |   WARD    |  7521 | 7698 | Manager BLAKE is emp # 7698
    1 | CLARK     |  7782 | 7839 | Manager CLARK is emp # 7782
    2 |   MILLER  |  7934 | 7782 | Manager CLARK is emp # 7782
    1 | JONES     |  7566 | 7839 | Manager JONES is emp # 7566
    2 |   FORD    |  7902 | 7566 | Manager JONES is emp # 7566
    3 |     SMITH |  7369 | 7902 | Manager JONES is emp # 7566
    2 |   SCOTT   |  7788 | 7566 | Manager JONES is emp # 7566
    3 |     ADAMS |  7876 | 7788 | Manager JONES is emp # 7566
(13 rows)
