<div id="hierarchical_queries" class="registered_link"></div>

A *hierarchical query* is a type of query that returns the rows of the result set in a hierarchical order based upon data forming a parent-child relationship. A hierarchy is typically represented by an inverted tree structure. The tree is comprised of interconnected *nodes*. Each node may be connected to none, one, or multiple *child* nodes. Each node is connected to one *parent* node except for the top node which has no parent. This node is the *root* node. Each tree has exactly one root node. Nodes that donâ€™t have any children are called *leaf* nodes. A tree always has at least one leaf node - e.g., the trivial case where the tree is comprised of a single node. In this case it is both the root and the leaf.

In a hierarchical query the rows of the result set represent the nodes of one or more trees.

!!! Note
    It is possible that a single, given row may appear in more than one tree and thus appear more than once in the result set.

The hierarchical relationship in a query is described by the `CONNECT BY` clause which forms the basis of the order in which rows are returned in the result set. The context of where the `CONNECT BY` clause and its associated optional clauses appear in the `SELECT` command is shown below.

```text
SELECT <select_list> FROM <table_expression> [ WHERE ...]
  [ START WITH <start_expression> ]
    CONNECT BY { PRIOR <parent_expr> = <child_expr> |
      <child_expr> = PRIOR <parent_expr> }
  [ ORDER SIBLINGS BY <column1> [ ASC | DESC ]
      [, <column2> [ ASC | DESC ] ] ...
  [ GROUP BY ...]
  [ HAVING ...]
  [ <other> ...]
```

`select_list` is one or more expressions that comprise the fields of the result set. `table_expression` is one or more tables or views from which the rows of the result set originate. `other` is any additional legal `SELECT` command clauses. The clauses pertinent to hierarchical queries, `START WITH, CONNECT BY`, and `ORDER SIBLINGS BY` are described in the following sections.

!!! Note
    At this time, Advanced Server does not support the use of `AND` (or other operators) in the `CONNECT BY` clause.
