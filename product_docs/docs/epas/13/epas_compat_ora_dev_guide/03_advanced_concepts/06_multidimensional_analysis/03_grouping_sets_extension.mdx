<div id="grouping_sets_extension" class="registered_link"></div>

The use of the `GROUPING SETS` extension within the `GROUP BY` clause provides a means to produce one result set that is actually the concatenation of multiple results sets based upon different groupings. In other words, a `UNION ALL` operation is performed combining the result sets of multiple groupings into one result set.

Note that a `UNION ALL` operation, and therefore the `GROUPING SETS` extension, do not eliminate duplicate rows from the result sets that are being combined together.

The syntax for a single `GROUPING SETS` extension is as follows:

```text
GROUPING SETS (
   { <expr_1> | ( <expr_1a> [, <expr_1b> ] ...) |
     ROLLUP ( <expr_list> ) | CUBE ( <expr_list> )
   } [, ...] )
```

A `GROUPING SETS` extension can contain any combination of one or more comma-separated expressions, lists of expressions enclosed within parenthesis, `ROLLUP` extensions, and `CUBE` extensions.

The `GROUPING SETS` extension is specified within the context of the `GROUP BY` clause as shown by the following:

```text
SELECT <select_list> FROM ...
GROUP BY [... ,] GROUPING SETS ( <expression_list> ) [, ...]
```

The items specified in `select_list` must also appear in the `GROUPING SETS expression_list`; or they must be aggregate functions such as `COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN`, or `MAX`; or they must be constants or functions whose return values are independent of the individual rows in the group (for example, the `SYSDATE` function).

The `GROUP BY` clause may specify multiple `GROUPING SETS` extensions as well as multiple occurrences of other `GROUP BY` extensions and individual expressions.

The `ORDER BY` clause should be used if you want the output to display in a meaningful structure. There is no guarantee on the order of the result set if no `ORDER BY` clause is specified.

The following query produces a union of groups given by columns `loc, dname`, and `job`.

```text
SELECT loc, dname, job, COUNT(*) AS "employees" FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (loc, dname, job)
ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;
```

The result is as follows:

```text
loc      |   dname    |    job    | employees
---------+------------+-----------+-----------
BOSTON   |            |           |         8
CHICAGO  |            |           |         6
NEW YORK |            |           |         3
         | ACCOUNTING |           |         3
         | OPERATIONS |           |         3
         | RESEARCH   |           |         5
         | SALES      |           |         6
         |            | ANALYST   |         3
         |            | CLERK     |         5
         |            | MANAGER   |         4
         |            | PRESIDENT |         1
         |            | SALESMAN  |         4
(12 rows)
```

This is equivalent to the following query, which employs the use of the `UNION ALL` operator.

```text
SELECT loc AS "loc", NULL AS "dname", NULL AS "job", COUNT(*) AS "employees"
FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY loc
  UNION ALL
SELECT NULL, dname, NULL, COUNT(*) AS "employees" FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY dname
  UNION ALL
SELECT NULL, NULL, job, COUNT(*) AS "employees" FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY job
ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;
```

The output from the `UNION ALL` query is the same as the `GROUPING SETS` output.

```text
loc      |   dname    |    job    | employees
---------+------------+-----------+-----------
BOSTON   |            |           |         8
CHICAGO  |            |           |         6
NEW YORK |            |           |         3
         | ACCOUNTING |           |         3
         | OPERATIONS |           |         3
         | RESEARCH   |           |         5
         | SALES      |           |         6
         |            | ANALYST   |         3
         |            | CLERK     |         5
         |            | MANAGER   |         4
         |            | PRESIDENT |         1
         |            | SALESMAN  |         4
(12 rows)
```

The following example shows how various types of `GROUP BY` extensions can be used together within a `GROUPING SETS` expression list.

```text
SELECT loc, dname, job, COUNT(*) AS "employees" FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (loc, ROLLUP (dname, job), CUBE (job, loc))
ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;
```

The following is the output from this query.

```text
loc      |   dname    |    job    | employees
---------+------------+-----------+-----------
BOSTON   |            | ANALYST   |         3
BOSTON   |            | CLERK     |         3
BOSTON   |            | MANAGER   |         2
BOSTON   |            |           |         8
BOSTON   |            |           |         8

         | RESEARCH   |           |         5
         | SALES      | CLERK     |         1
         | SALES      | MANAGER   |         1
         | SALES      | SALESMAN  |         4
         | SALES      |           |         6

         |            | PRESIDENT |         1
         |            | SALESMAN  |         4
         |            |           |        17
         |            |           |        17
(38 rows)
```

The output is basically a concatenation of the result sets that would be produced individually from `GROUP BY loc, GROUP BY ROLLUP (dname, job)`, and `GROUP BY CUBE (job, loc)`. These individual queries are shown by the following.

```text
SELECT loc, NULL AS "dname", NULL AS "job", COUNT(*) AS "employees"
FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY loc
ORDER BY 1;
```

The following is the result set from the `GROUP BY loc` clause.

```text
loc      | dname | job | employees
----------+-------+-----+-----------
BOSTON   |       |     |         8
CHICAGO  |       |     |         6
NEW YORK |       |     |         3
(3 rows)
```

The following query uses the `GROUP BY ROLLUP (dname, job)` clause.

```text
SELECT NULL AS "loc", dname, job, COUNT(*) AS "employees" FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY ROLLUP (dname, job)
ORDER BY 2, 3;
```

The following is the result set from the `GROUP BY ROLLUP (dname, job)` clause.

```text
loc |   dname    |    job    | employees
----+------------+-----------+-----------
    | ACCOUNTING | CLERK     |         1
    | ACCOUNTING | MANAGER   |         1
    | ACCOUNTING | PRESIDENT |         1
    | ACCOUNTING |           |         3
    | OPERATIONS | ANALYST   |         1
    | OPERATIONS | CLERK     |         1
    | OPERATIONS | MANAGER   |         1
    | OPERATIONS |           |         3
    | RESEARCH   | ANALYST   |         2
    | RESEARCH   | CLERK     |         2
    | RESEARCH   | MANAGER   |         1
    | RESEARCH   |           |         5
    | SALES      | CLERK     |         1
    | SALES      | MANAGER   |         1
    | SALES      | SALESMAN  |         4
    | SALES      |           |         6
    |            |           |        17
(17 rows)
```

The following query uses the `GROUP BY CUBE (job, loc)` clause.

```text
SELECT loc, NULL AS "dname", job, COUNT(*) AS "employees" FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY CUBE (job, loc)
ORDER BY 1, 3;
```

The following is the result set from the `GROUP BY CUBE (job, loc)` clause.

```text
loc      | dname |    job    | employees
---------+-------+-----------+-----------
BOSTON   |       | ANALYST   |         3
BOSTON   |       | CLERK     |         3
BOSTON   |       | MANAGER   |         2
BOSTON   |       |           |         8
CHICAGO  |       | CLERK     |         1
CHICAGO  |       | MANAGER   |         1
CHICAGO  |       | SALESMAN  |         4
CHICAGO  |       |           |         6
NEW YORK |       | CLERK     |         1
NEW YORK |       | MANAGER   |         1
NEW YORK |       | PRESIDENT |         1
NEW YORK |       |           |         3
         |       | ANALYST   |         3
         |       | CLERK     |         5
         |       | MANAGER   |         4
         |       | PRESIDENT |         1
         |       | SALESMAN  |         4
         |       |           |        17
(18 rows)
```

If the previous three queries are combined with the `UNION ALL` operator, a concatenation of the three results sets is produced.

```text
SELECT loc AS "loc", NULL AS "dname", NULL AS "job", COUNT(*) AS "employees"
FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY loc
  UNION ALL
SELECT NULL, dname, job, count(*) AS "employees" FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY ROLLUP (dname, job)
  UNION ALL
SELECT loc, NULL, job, count(*) AS "employees" FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY CUBE (job, loc)
ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;
```

The following is the output, which is the same as when the `GROUP BY GROUPING SETS (loc, ROLLUP (dname, job), CUBE (job, loc))` clause is used.

```text
loc      |   dname    |    job    | employees
