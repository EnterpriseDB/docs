A new table is created by specifying the table name, along with all column names and their types. The following is a simplified version of the `emp` sample table with just the minimal information needed to define a table.

```text
CREATE TABLE emp (
    empno           NUMBER(4),
    ename           VARCHAR2(10),
    job             VARCHAR2(9),
    mgr             NUMBER(4),
    hiredate        DATE,
    sal             NUMBER(7,2),
    comm            NUMBER(7,2),
    deptno          NUMBER(2)
);
```

You can enter this into PSQL with line breaks. PSQL will recognize that the command is not terminated until the semicolon.

White space (i.e., spaces, tabs, and newlines) may be used freely in SQL commands. That means you can type the command aligned differently than the above, or even all on one line. Two dashes ("--") introduce comments. Whatever follows them is ignored up to the end of the line. SQL is case insensitive about key words and identifiers, except when identifiers are double-quoted to preserve the case (not done above).

`VARCHAR2(10)` specifies a data type that can store arbitrary character strings up to 10 characters in length. `NUMBER(7,2)` is a fixed point number with precision 7 and scale 2. `NUMBER(4)` is an integer number with precision 4 and scale 0.

Advanced Server supports the usual SQL data types `INTEGER`, `SMALLINT`, `NUMBER`, `REAL`, `DOUBLE PRECISION`, `CHAR`, `VARCHAR2`, `DATE`, and `TIMESTAMP` as well as various synonyms for these types.

If you donâ€™t need a table any longer or want to recreate it differently you can remove it using the following command:

```text
DROP TABLE tablename;
```
