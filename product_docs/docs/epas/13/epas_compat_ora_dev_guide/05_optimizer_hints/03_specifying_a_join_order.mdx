Include the `ORDERED` directive to instruct the query optimizer to join tables in the order in which they are listed in the `FROM` clause. If you do not include the `ORDERED` keyword, the query optimizer will choose the order in which to join the tables.

For example, the following command allows the optimizer to choose the order in which to join the tables listed in the `FROM` clause:

```text
SELECT e.ename, d.dname, h.startdate
  FROM emp e, dept d, jobhist h
  WHERE d.deptno = e.deptno
  AND h.empno = e.empno;
```

The following command instructs the optimizer to join the tables in the ordered specified:

```text
SELECT /*+ ORDERED */ e.ename, d.dname, h.startdate
  FROM emp e, dept d, jobhist h
  WHERE d.deptno = e.deptno
  AND h.empno = e.empno;
```

In the `ORDERED` version of the command, Advanced Server will first join `emp e` with `dept d` before joining the results with `jobhist h`. Without the `ORDERED` directive, the join order is selected by the query optimizer.

!!! Note
    The `ORDERED` directive does not work for Oracle-style outer joins (those joins that contain a '+' sign).
