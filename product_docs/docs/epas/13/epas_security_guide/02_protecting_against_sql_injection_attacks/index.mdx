Advanced Server provides protection against SQL injection attacks. A *SQL injection attack* is an attempt to compromise a database by running SQL statements whose results provide clues to the attacker as to the content, structure, or security of that database.

Preventing a SQL injection attack is normally the responsibility of the application developer. The database administrator typically has little or no control over the potential threat. The difficulty for database administrators is that the application must have access to the data to function properly.

SQL/Protect is a module that allows a database administrator to protect a database from SQL injection attacks. SQL/Protect provides a layer of security in addition to the normal database security policies by examining incoming queries for common SQL injection profiles.

SQL/Protect gives the control back to the database administrator by alerting the administrator to potentially dangerous queries and by blocking these queries.
