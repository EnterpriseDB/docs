The examples shown in the documentation use the PSQL program. PSQL is a terminal-based command line interface for Postgres. The prompt that normally appears when using PSQL is omitted in these examples to provide extra clarity for the point being shown.

```text
Examples and output from examples are shown in a fixed-width, white font on a dark background.
```

Consider the following key points related to the examples:

-   During installation of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you must make selections for configuration and defaults compatible with Oracle databases to reproduce the same results as the examples. You can verify a default compatible configuration by issuing the following commands in PSQL and returning the results shown:

    ```sql
    SHOW edb_redwood_date;

     edb_redwood_date
    ------------------
     on

    SHOW datestyle;

     DateStyle
    --------------
     Redwood, DMY

    SHOW edb_redwood_strings;

     edb_redwood_strings
    ---------------------
     on
    ```

-   The examples use the sample tables, `dept`, `emp`, and `jobhist`, created and loaded when EDB Postgres Advanced Server was installed. The `emp` table is installed with triggers that you must disable to reproduce the same results as the examples. Log in to EDB Postgres Advanced Server as the enterprisedb superuser, and disable the triggers by issuing the following command:
-   
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE emp DISABLE TRIGGER USER;
    ```
    
    You can later reactivate the triggers on the `emp` table with the following command:
    
    ```sql
    ALTER TABLE emp ENABLE TRIGGER USER;
    ```
