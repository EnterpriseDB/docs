To determine the children for any given row:

1.  Evaluate `parent_expr` on the given row.

2.  Evaluate `child_expr` on any other row resulting from the evaluation of `table_expression`.

3.  If `parent_expr = child_expr`, then this row is a child node of the given parent row.

4.  Repeat the process for all remaining rows in `table_expression`. All rows that satisfy the equation in step 3 are the children nodes of the given parent row.

!!! Note
    The evaluation process to determine if a row is a child node occurs on every row returned by `table_expression` before the `WHERE` clause is applied to `table_expression`.

Iteratively repeating this process, treating each child node found in the prior steps as a parent, constructs an inverted tree of nodes. The process is complete when the final set of child nodes has no children of its own. These are the leaf nodes.

A `SELECT` command that includes a `CONNECT BY` clause typically includes the `START WITH` clause. The `START WITH` clause determines the rows that are to be the root nodes, that is, the rows that are the initial parent nodes upon which to apply the algorithm.
