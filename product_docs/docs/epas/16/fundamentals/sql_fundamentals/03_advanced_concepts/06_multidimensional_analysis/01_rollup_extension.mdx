<div id="rollup_extension" class="registered_link"></div>

The `ROLLUP` extension produces a hierarchical set of groups with subtotals for each hierarchical group as well as a grand total. The order of the hierarchy is determined by the order of the expressions given in the `ROLLUP` expression list. The top of the hierarchy is the left-most item in the list. Each successive item proceeding to the right moves down the hierarchy. The right-most item is at the lowest level.

## Syntax 

The syntax for a single `ROLLUP` is:

```sql
ROLLUP ( { <expr_1> | ( <expr_1a> [, <expr_1b> ] ...) }
  [, <expr_2> | ( <expr_2a> [, <expr_2b> ] ...) ] ...)
```

Each `expr` is an expression that determines the grouping of the result set. If enclosed in parenthesis as `( expr_1a, expr_1b, ...)`, then the combination of values returned by `expr_1a` and `expr_1b` defines a single grouping level of the hierarchy.

The base level of aggregates returned in the result set is for each unique combination of values returned by the expression list.

In addition, a subtotal is returned for the first item in the list (`expr_1` or the combination of `( expr_1a, expr_1b, ...)`, whichever is specified) for each unique value. A subtotal is returned for the second item in the list (`expr_2` or the combination of `( expr_2a, expr_2b, ...)`, whichever is specified) for each unique value in each grouping of the first item and so on. Finally, a grand total is returned for the entire result set.

For the subtotal rows, null is returned for the items across which the subtotal is taken.

The `ROLLUP` extension specified in the context of the `GROUP BY` clause is shown by the following:

```sql
SELECT <select_list> FROM ...
GROUP BY [... ,] ROLLUP ( <expression_list> ) [, ...]
```

The items specified in `select_list` must either:

-  Also appear in the `ROLLUP expression_list` 
-  Be aggregate functions such as `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN,` or `MAX`
-  Be constants or functions whose return values are independent of the individual rows in the group (for example, the `SYSDATE` function)

Use the `GROUP BY` clause to specify multiple `ROLLUP` extensions as well as multiple occurrences of other `GROUP BY` extensions and individual expressions.

Use the `ORDER BY` clause to display the output in a hierarchical or other meaningful structure. Using this clause guarantees the order of the result set.

The number of grouping levels or totals is *n* + *1* where *n* represents the number of items in the `ROLLUP` expression list. A parenthesized list counts as one item.

## Examples 

The following query produces a rollup based on a hierarchy of columns `loc`, `dname`, and then `job`.

```sql
SELECT loc, dname, job, COUNT(*) AS "employees" FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY ROLLUP (loc, dname, job)
ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;
```

The result of the query displays a count of the number of employees for each unique combination of `loc`, `dname`, and `job`, as well as subtotals for each unique combination of `loc` and `dname` for each unique value of `loc`. A grand total appears on the last line:

```sql
__OUTPUT__
loc      |   dname    |    job    | employees
---------+------------+-----------+-----------
BOSTON   | OPERATIONS | ANALYST   |         1
BOSTON   | OPERATIONS | CLERK     |         1
BOSTON   | OPERATIONS | MANAGER   |         1
BOSTON   | OPERATIONS |           |         3
BOSTON   | RESEARCH   | ANALYST   |         2
BOSTON   | RESEARCH   | CLERK     |         2
BOSTON   | RESEARCH   | MANAGER   |         1
BOSTON   | RESEARCH   |           |         5
BOSTON   |            |           |         8
CHICAGO  | SALES      | CLERK     |         1
CHICAGO  | SALES      | MANAGER   |         1
CHICAGO  | SALES      | SALESMAN  |         4
CHICAGO  | SALES      |           |         6
CHICAGO  |            |           |         6
NEW YORK | ACCOUNTING | CLERK     |         1
NEW YORK | ACCOUNTING | MANAGER   |         1
NEW YORK | ACCOUNTING | PRESIDENT |         1
NEW YORK | ACCOUNTING |           |         3
NEW YORK |            |           |         3
         |            |           |        17
(20 rows)
```

The following query shows the effect of combining items in the `ROLLUP` list in parentheses:

```sql
SELECT loc, dname, job, COUNT(*) AS "employees" FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY ROLLUP (loc, (dname, job))
ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;
```

The output doesn't include subtotals for `loc` and `dname` combinations as in the prior example:

```sql
__OUTPUT__
loc      |   dname    |    job    | employees
---------+------------+-----------+-----------
BOSTON   | OPERATIONS | ANALYST   |         1
BOSTON   | OPERATIONS | CLERK     |         1
BOSTON   | OPERATIONS | MANAGER   |         1
BOSTON   | RESEARCH   | ANALYST   |         2
BOSTON   | RESEARCH   | CLERK     |         2
BOSTON   | RESEARCH   | MANAGER   |         1
BOSTON   |            |           |         8
CHICAGO  | SALES      | CLERK     |         1
CHICAGO  | SALES      | MANAGER   |         1
CHICAGO  | SALES      | SALESMAN  |         4
CHICAGO  |            |           |         6
NEW YORK | ACCOUNTING | CLERK     |         1
NEW YORK | ACCOUNTING | MANAGER   |         1
NEW YORK | ACCOUNTING | PRESIDENT |         1
NEW YORK |            |           |         3
         |            |           |        17
(16 rows)
```

If the first two columns in the `ROLLUP` list are enclosed in parentheses, the subtotal levels differ as well:

```sql
SELECT loc, dname, job, COUNT(*) AS "employees" FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY ROLLUP ((loc, dname), job)
ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;
```

Now there's a subtotal for each unique `loc` and `dname` combination but none for unique values of `loc`:

```sql
__OUTPUT__
loc      |   dname    |    job    | employees
---------+------------+-----------+-----------
BOSTON   | OPERATIONS | ANALYST   |         1
BOSTON   | OPERATIONS | CLERK     |         1
BOSTON   | OPERATIONS | MANAGER   |         1
BOSTON   | OPERATIONS |           |         3
BOSTON   | RESEARCH   | ANALYST   |         2
BOSTON   | RESEARCH   | CLERK     |         2
BOSTON   | RESEARCH   | MANAGER   |         1
BOSTON   | RESEARCH   |           |         5
CHICAGO  | SALES      | CLERK     |         1
CHICAGO  | SALES      | MANAGER   |         1
CHICAGO  | SALES      | SALESMAN  |         4
CHICAGO  | SALES      |           |         6
NEW YORK | ACCOUNTING | CLERK     |         1
NEW YORK | ACCOUNTING | MANAGER   |         1
NEW YORK | ACCOUNTING | PRESIDENT |         1
NEW YORK | ACCOUNTING |           |         3
         |            |           |        17
(17 rows)
```
