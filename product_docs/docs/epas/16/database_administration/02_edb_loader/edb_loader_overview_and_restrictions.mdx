## Key features 

EDB\*Loader features include:

-   Support for the Oracle SQL\*Loader data loading methods (conventional path load, direct path load, and parallel direct path load)
-   Syntax for control file directives compatible with Oracle SQL\*Loader
-   Input data with delimiter-separated or fixed-width fields
-   Bad file for collecting rejected records
-   Loading of multiple target tables
-   Discard file for collecting records that don't meet the selection criteria of any target table
-   Log file for recording the EDB\*Loader session and any error messages
-   Data loading from standard input and remote loading, particularly useful for large data sources on remote hosts

## Version compatibility restrictions

The important version compatibility restrictions between the EDB\*Loader client and the database server are:

-   When you invoke the EDB\*Loader program (called `edbldr`), you pass in parameters and directive information to the database server. We strongly recommend that you use the version of the EDB\*Loader client, the `edbldr` program supplied with the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server you are using, to load data only into the database server. In general, use the same version for the EDB\*Loader client and database server.

-   Using EDB\*Loader with connection poolers such as PgPool-II and PgBouncer isn't supported. EDB\*Loader must connect directly to EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 14. Alternatively, you can use these commands for loading data through connection poolers:

```shell
psql \copy
jdbc copyIn
psycopg2 copy_from
```
