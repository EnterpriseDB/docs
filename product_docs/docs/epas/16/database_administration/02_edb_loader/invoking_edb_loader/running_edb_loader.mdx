Use the following command to invoke EDB\*Loader from the command line:

```sql
edbldr [ -d <dbname> ] [ -p <port> ] [ -h <host> ]
[ USERID={ <username/password> | <username>/ | <username> | / } ]
[ { -c | connstr= } <CONNECTION_STRING> ]
  CONTROL=<control_file>
[ DATA=<data_file> ]
[ BAD=<bad_file>]
[ DISCARD=<discard_file> ]
[ DISCARDMAX=<max_discard_recs> ]
[ HANDLE_CONFLICTS={ FALSE | TRUE } ]
[ LOG=<log_file> ]
[ PARFILE=<param_file> ]
[ DIRECT={ FALSE | TRUE } ]
[ FREEZE={ FALSE | TRUE } ]
[ ERRORS=<error_count> ]
[ PARALLEL={ FALSE | TRUE } ]
[ ROWS=<n> ]
[ SKIP=<skip_count> ]
[ SKIP_INDEX_MAINTENANCE={ FALSE | TRUE } ]
[ edb_resource_group=<group_name> ]
```

## Description

You can specify parameters listed in the syntax diagram in a *parameter file*. Exeptions include the `-d` option, `-p` option, `-h` option, and the `PARFILE` parameter. Specify the parameter file on the command line when you invoke edbldr using `PARFILE=param_file`. You can specify some parameters in the `OPTIONS` clause in the control file. For more information on the control file, see [Building the EDB\*Loader control file](../building_the_control_file/).

You can include the full directory path or a relative directory path to the file name when specifying `control_file`, `data_file`, `bad_file`, `discard_file`, `log_file`, and `param_file`. If you specify the file name alone or with a relative directory path, the file is assumed to exist in the case of `control_file`, `data_file`, or `param_file` relative to the current working directory from which edbldr is invoked. In the case of `bad_file`, `discard_file`, or `log_file`, the file is created.

If you omit the `-d` option, the `-p` option, or the `-h` option, the defaults for the database, port, and host are determined by the same rules as other EDB Postgres Advanced Server utility programs, such as edb-psql.

## Requirements

- The control file must exist in the character set encoding of the client where edbldr is invoked. If the client is in an encoding different from the database encoding, then you must set the `PGCLIENTENCODING` environment variable on the client to the client’s encoding prior to invoking edbldr. This technique ensures character set conversion between the client and the database server is done correctly.

- The file names must include these extensions:
  - `control_file` must use the `.ctl` extension. 
  - `data_file` must use the `.dat` extension. 
  - `bad_file` must use the `.bad` extension 
  - `discard_file` must use the `.dsc` extension 
  - `log_file` must include the `.log` extension
  
  If the provided file name doesn't have an extension, EDB\*Loader assumes the actual file name includes the appropriate extension.

- The operating system account used to invoke edbldr must have read permission on the directories and files specified by `control_file`, `data_file`, and `param_file`.

- The operating system account enterprisedb must have write permission on the directories where `bad_file`, `discard_file`, and `log_file` are  written.

## Parameters

`dbname`

 Name of the database containing the tables to load.

`port`

 Port number on which the database server is accepting connections.

`host`

 IP address of the host on which the database server is running.

`USERID={ <username/password> | <username/> | <username> | / }`

 EDB\*Loader connects to the database with `<username>`. `<username>` must be a superuser or a username with the required privileges. `<password>` is the password for `<username>`.

 If you omit the `USERID` parameter, EDB\*Loader prompts for `username` and `password`. If you specify `USERID=username/`, then EDB\*Loader either:
 -  Uses the password file specified by the environment variable `PGPASSFILE` if `PGPASSFILE` is set
 -  Uses the `.pgpass` password file (`pgpass.conf` on Windows systems) if `PGPASSFILE` isn't set 
 
 If you specify `USERID=username`, then EDB\*Loader prompts for `password`. If you specify `USERID=/`, the connection is attempted using the operating system account as the user name.

 !!! Note
     EDB\*Loader ignores the EDB Postgres Advanced Server connection environment variables `PGUSER` and `PGPASSWORD`. See the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html) for information on the `PGPASSFILE` environment variable and the password file.

`-c CONNECTION_STRING`

`connstr=CONNECTION_STRING`

 The `-c` or `connstr=` option allows you to specify all the connection parameters supported by libpq. With this option, you can also specify SSL connection parameters or other connection parameters supported by libpq. If you provide connection options such as `-d`, `-h`, `-p`, or `userid=dbuser/dbpass` separately, they might override the values provided by the `-c` or `connstr=` option.

`CONTROL=control_file`

 `control_file` specifies the name of the control file containing EDB\*Loader directives. If you don't specify a file extension, an extension of `.ctl` is assumed.

 For more information on the control file, see [Building the EDB\*Loader control file](../building_the_control_file/).

`DATA=data_file`

 `data_file` specifies the name of the file containing the data to load into the target table. If you don't specify a file extension, an extension of `.dat` is assumed. Specifying a `data_file` on the command line overrides the `INFILE` clause specified in the control file.

 For more information about `data_file`, see [Building the EDB\*Loader control file](../building_the_control_file/).

`BAD=bad_file`

 `bad_file` specifies the name of a file that receives input data records that can't be loaded due to errors. Specifying `bad_file` on the command line overrides any `BADFILE` clause specified in the control file.

 For more information about `bad_file`, see [Building the EDB\*Loader control file](../building_the_control_file/).

`DISCARD=discard_file`

 `discard_file` is the name of the file that receives input data records that don't meet any table’s selection criteria. Specifying `discard_file` on the command line overrides the `DISCARDFILE` clause in the control file.

 For more information about `discard_file`, see [Building the EDB\*Loader control file](../building_the_control_file/).

`DISCARDMAX=max_discard_recs`

 `max_discard_recs` is the maximum number of discarded records that can be encountered from the input data records before terminating the EDB\*Loader session. Specifying `max_discard_recs` on the command line overrides the `DISCARDMAX` or `DISCARDS` clause in the control file.

 For more information about `max_discard_recs`, see [Building the EDB\*Loader control file](../building_the_control_file/).

`HANDLE_CONFLICTS={ FALSE | TRUE }`

 If any record insertion fails due to a unique constraint violation, EDB\*Loader aborts the entire operation. You can instruct EDB\*Loader to instead move the duplicate record to the `BAD` file and continue processing by setting `HANDLE_CONFLICTS` to `TRUE`. This behavior applies only if indexes are present. By default, `HANDLE_CONFLICTS` is set to `FALSE`.

 Setting `HANDLE_CONFLICTS` to `TRUE` isn't supported with direct path loading. If you set this parameter to `TRUE` when direct path loading, EDB\*Loader throws an error.

`LOG=log_file`

 `log_file` specifies the name of the file in which EDB\*Loader records the results of the EDB\*Loader session.

 If you omit the `LOG` parameter, EDB\*Loader creates a log file with the name `control_file_base.log` in the directory from which edbldr is invoked. `control_file_base` is the base name of the control file used in the EDB\*Loader session. The operating system account `enterprisedb` must have write permission on the directory where the log file is written.

`PARFILE=param_file`

 `param_file` specifies the name of the file that contains command line parameters for the EDB\*Loader session. You can specify command line parameters listed in this section in `param_file` instead of on the command line. Exceptions are the `-d`, `-p`, and `-h` options, and the `PARFILE` parameter.

 Any parameter given in `param_file` overrides the same parameter supplied on the command line before the `PARFILE` option. Any parameter given on the command line that appears after the `PARFILE` option overrides the same parameter given in `param_file`.

 !!! Note
    Unlike other EDB\*Loader files, there's no default file name or extension assumed for `param_file`. However, by Oracle SQL\*Loader convention, `.par` is typically used as an extension. It isn't required.

`DIRECT= { FALSE | TRUE }`

 If `DIRECT` is set to `TRUE`, EDB\*Loader performs a direct path load instead of a conventional path load. The default value of `DIRECT` is `FALSE`.

 Don't set `DIRECT=true` when loading the data into a replicated table. If you're using EDB\*Loader to load data into a replicated table and set `DIRECT=true`, indexes might omit rows that are in a table or might contain references to rows that were deleted. EnterpriseDB doesn't support direct inserts to load data into replicated tables.

 For information about direct path loads, see [Direct path load](direct_path_load).

`FREEZE= { FALSE | TRUE }`

 Set `FREEZE` to `TRUE` to copy the data with the rows *frozen*. A tuple guaranteed to be visible to all current and future transactions is marked as frozen to prevent transaction ID wraparound. For more information about frozen tuples, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/routine-vacuuming.html).

 You must specify a data-loading type of `TRUNCATE` in the control file when using the `FREEZE` option. `FREEZE` isn't supported for direct loading.

 By default, `FREEZE` is `FALSE`.

`ERRORS=error_count`

 `error_count` specifies the number of errors permitted before aborting the EDB\*Loader session. The default is `50`.

`PARALLEL= { FALSE | TRUE }`

 Set `PARALLEL` to `TRUE` to indicate that this EDB\*Loader session is one of a number of concurrent EDB\*Loader sessions participating in a parallel direct path load. The default value of `PARALLEL` is `FALSE`.

 When `PARALLEL` is `TRUE`, the `DIRECT` parameter must also be set to `TRUE`.

 For more information about parallel direct path loads, see [Parallel direct path load](parallel_direct_path_load).

`ROWS=n`

 `n` specifies the number of rows that EDB\*Loader commits before loading the next set of `n` rows.

`SKIP=skip_count`

 Number of records at the beginning of the input data file to skip before loading begins. The default is `0`.

`SKIP_INDEX_MAINTENANCE= { FALSE | TRUE }`

 If set to `TRUE`, index maintenance isn't performed as part of a direct path load, and indexes on the loaded table are marked as invalid. The default value of `SKIP_INDEX_MAINTENANCE` is `FALSE`.

 During a parallel direct path load, target table indexes aren't updated. They're marked as invalid after the load is complete.

 You can use the `REINDEX` command to rebuild an index. For more information about the `REINDEX` command, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-reindex.htm).

`edb_resource_group=group_name`

 `group_name` specifies the name of an EDB Resource Manager resource group to which to assign the EDB\*Loader session.

 Any default resource group that was assigned to the session is overridden by the resource group given by the `edb_resource_group` parameter specified on the edbldr command line. An example of such a group is a database user running the EDB\*Loader session who was assigned a default resource group with the `ALTER ROLE ... SET` `edb_resource_group` command.

## Examples

This example invokes EDB\*Loader using a control file named `emp.ctl` to load a table in database `edb`. The file is located in the current working directory.

```shell
$ /usr/edb/as16/bin/edbldr -d edb USERID=enterprisedb/password
CONTROL=emp.ctl
EDB*Loader: Copyright (c) 2007-2021, EnterpriseDB Corporation.

Successfully loaded (4) records
```

In this example, EDB\*Loader prompts for the user name and password since they're omitted from the command line. In addition, the files for the bad file and log file are specified with the `BAD` and `LOG` command line parameters.

```shell
$ /usr/edb/as16/bin/edbldr -d edb CONTROL=emp.ctl BAD=/tmp/emp.bad
LOG=/tmp/emp.log
Enter the user name : enterprisedb
Enter the password :
EDB*Loader: Copyright (c) 2007-2021, EnterpriseDB Corporation.

Successfully loaded (4) records
```

This example runs EDB\*Loader using a parameter file located in the current working directory. The `SKIP` and `ERRORS` parameter default values are specified in the parameter file in addition the `CONTROL`, `BAD`, and `LOG` files. The parameter file, `emp.par`, contains:

```ini
CONTROL=emp.ctl
BAD=/tmp/emp.bad
LOG=/tmp/emp.log
SKIP=1
ERRORS=10
```

Invoke EDB\*Loader with the parameter file:

```shell
$ /usr/edb/as16/bin/edbldr -d edb PARFILE=emp.par
Enter the user name : enterprisedb
Enter the password :
EDB*Loader: Copyright (c) 2007-2021, EnterpriseDB Corporation.

Successfully loaded (3) records
```

This example invokes EDB\*Loader using a `connstr=` option that uses the `emp.ctl` control file located in the current working directory to load a table in a database named `edb`:

```shell
$ /usr/edb/as16/bin/edbldr connstr=\"sslmode=verify-ca sslcompression=0
host=127.0.0.1 dbname=edb port=5444 user=enterprisedb\" CONTROL=emp.ctl
EDB*Loader: Copyright (c) 2007-2021, EnterpriseDB Corporation.

Successfully loaded (4) records
```

This example invokes EDB\*Loader using a normal user. For this example, one empty table `bar` is created and a normal user `bob` is created. The `bob` user is granted all privileges on the table `bar`. The CREATE TABLE command creates the empty table. The CREATE USER command creates the user, and the GRANT command gives required privileges to the user `bob` on the `bar` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE bar(i int); 
CREATE USER bob identified by '123';
GRANT ALL on bar TO bob;
```

The control file and data file:

```shell
## Control file
EDBAS/ - (master) $ cat /tmp/edbldr.ctl 
LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/edbldr.dat'
truncate into table bar
(
i position(1:1)
)

## Data file
EDBAS/ - (master) $ cat /tmp/edbldr.dat 
1
2
3
5
```

Invoke EDB\*Loader:

```shell
EDBAS/ - (master) $ /usr/edb/as16/bin/edbldr -d edb userid=bob/123 control=/tmp/edbldr.ctl
EDB*Loader: Copyright (c) 2007-2022, EnterpriseDB Corporation.

Successfully loaded (4) records
```

## Exit codes

When EDB\*Loader exits, it returns one of the following codes:

| Exit code | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
