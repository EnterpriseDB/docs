<div id="compatibility_options" class="registered_link"></div>

These configuration parameters control various database compatibility features.

## edb_redwood_date

**Parameter type:** Boolean

**Default value:** `false`

**Range:** `{true | false}`

**Minimum scope of effect:** Per session

**When value changes take effect:** Immediate

**Required authorization to activate:** Session user

Translates `DATE` to `TIMESTAMP` when `DATE` appears as the data type of a column in the commands and the table definition is stored in the database. A time component is stored in the column along with the date.

If `edb_redwood_date` is set to `FALSE`, the column’s data type in a `CREATE TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE` command remains as a native PostgreSQL `DATE` data type and is stored as such in the database. The PostgreSQL `DATE` data type stores only the date without a time component in the column.

Regardless of the setting of `edb_redwood_date`, when `DATE` appears as a data type in any other context, it's always internally translated to a `TIMESTAMP`. It can thus handle a time component if present. Examples of these contexts include:

-  The data type of a variable in an SPL declaration section 
-  The data type of a formal parameter in an SPL procedure or SPL function
-  The return type of an SPL function

## edb_redwood_greatest_least

**Parameter type:** Boolean

**Default value:** `true`

**Range:** `{true | false}`

**Minimum scope of effect:** Per session

**When value changes take effect:** Immediate

**Required authorization to activate:** Session user

The `GREATEST` function returns the parameter with the greatest value from its list of parameters. The `LEAST` function returns the parameter with the least value from its list of parameters.

When `edb_redwood_greatest_least` is set to `TRUE`, the `GREATEST` and `LEAST` functions return null when at least one of the parameters is null.

```sql
SET edb_redwood_greatest_least TO on;

SELECT GREATEST(1, 2, NULL, 3);
__OUTPUT__
greatest
----------

(1 row)
```

When `edb_redwood_greatest_least` is set to `FALSE`, null parameters are ignored except when all parameters are null. In that case, the functions return null.

```sql
SET edb_redwood_greatest_least TO off;

SELECT GREATEST(1, 2, NULL, 3);
__OUTPUT__
greatest
----------

        3
(1 row)
```
```sql
SELECT GREATEST(NULL, NULL, NULL);
__OUTPUT__
greatest
----------

(1 row)
```

## edb_redwood_raw_names

**Parameter type:** Boolean

**Default value:** `false`

**Range:** `{true | false}`

**Minimum scope of effect:** Per session

**When value changes take effect:** Immediate

**Required authorization to activate:** Session user

When `edb_redwood_raw_names` is set to `FALSE`, database object names such as table names, column names, trigger names, program names, and user names appear in uppercase letters when viewed from Redwood catalogs (that is, system catalogs prefixed by `ALL_`, `DBA_`, or `USER_`). In addition, quotation marks enclose names that were created with enclosing quotation marks.

When `edb_redwood_raw_names` is set to `TRUE`, the database object names are displayed as they're stored in the PostgreSQL system catalogs when viewed from the Redwood catalogs. Names created without quotation marks around them appear in lower case as expected in PostgreSQL. Names created enclosed by quotation marks appear as they were created but without the quotation marks.

For example, the following user name is created, and then a session is started with that user:

```sql
CREATE USER reduser IDENTIFIED BY password;
edb=# \c - reduser
Password for user reduser:
You are now connected to database "edb" as user "reduser".
```

When connected to the database as `reduser`, the following tables are created:

```sql
CREATE TABLE all_lower (col INTEGER);
CREATE TABLE ALL_UPPER (COL INTEGER);
CREATE TABLE "Mixed_Case" ("Col" INTEGER);
```

When viewed from the Redwood catalog `USER_TABLES`, with `edb_redwood_raw_names` set to the default value `FALSE`, the names appear in upper case. The exception is the `Mixed_Case` name, which appears as created and also enclosed by quotation marks.

```sql
edb=> SELECT * FROM USER_TABLES;
__OUTPUT__
 schema_name  | table_name   | tablespace_name  | status  | temporary
--------------+--------------+------------------+---------+-----------
 REDUSER      | ALL_LOWER    |                  | VALID   | N
 REDUSER      | ALL_UPPER    |                  | VALID   | N
 REDUSER      | "Mixed_Case" |                  | VALID   | N
(3 rows)
```

When viewed with `edb_redwood_raw_names` set to `TRUE`, the names appear in lower case except for the `Mixed_Case` name, which appears as created but without quotation marks.

```sql
edb=> SET edb_redwood_raw_names TO true;
SET
edb=> SELECT  * FROM USER_TABLES;
__OUTPUT__
 schema_name | table_name | tablespace_name  | status | temporary
-------------+------------+------------------+--------+-----------
reduser      | all_lower  |                  | VALID  | N
reduser      | all_upper  |                  | VALID  | N
reduser      | Mixed_Case |                  | VALID  | N
(3 rows)
```

These names now match the case when viewed from the PostgreSQL `pg_tables` catalog:

```sql
edb=> SELECT schemaname, tablename, tableowner FROM pg_tables WHERE
tableowner = 'reduser';
__OUTPUT__
 schemaname | tablename  | tableowner
------------+------------+------------
reduser     | all_lower  | reduser
reduser     | all_upper  | reduser
reduser     | Mixed_Case | reduser
(3 rows)
```

## edb_redwood_strings

**Parameter type:** Boolean

**Default value:** `false`

**Range:** `{true | false}`

**Minimum scope of effect:** Per session

**When value changes take effect:** Immediate

**Required authorization to activate:** Session user

If the `edb_redwood_strings` parameter is set to `TRUE`, when a string is concatenated with a null variable or null column, the result is the original string. If `edb_redwood_strings` is set to `FALSE`, the native PostgreSQL behavior is maintained, which is the concatenation of a string with a null variable or null column that gives a null result.

This example shows the difference. The sample application contains a table of employees. This table has a column named `comm` that's null for most employees. The following query is run with `edb_redwood_string` set to `FALSE`. Concatenating a null column with non-empty strings produces a final result of null, so only employees that have a commission appear in the query result. The output line for all other employees is null.

```sql
SET edb_redwood_strings TO off;

SELECT RPAD(ename,10) || ' ' || TO_CHAR(sal,'99,999.99') || ' ' ||
TO_CHAR(comm,'99,999.99') "EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION" FROM emp;
__OUTPUT__
   EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION
----------------------------------

 ALLEN        1,600.00     300.00
 WARD         1,250.00     500.00

 MARTIN       1,250.00   1,400.00




 TURNER       1,500.00        .00


(14 rows)
```

The following is the same query executed when `edb_redwood_strings` is set to `TRUE`. Here, the value of a null column is treated as an empty string. Concatenating an empty string with a non-empty string produces the non-empty string.

```sql
SET edb_redwood_strings TO on;

SELECT RPAD(ename,10) || ' ' || TO_CHAR(sal,'99,999.99') || ' ' ||
TO_CHAR(comm,'99,999.99') "EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION" FROM emp;
__OUTPUT__
      EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION

----------------------------------

 SMITH 800.00
 ALLEN 1,600.00 300.00
 WARD 1,250.00 500.00
 JONES 2,975.00
 MARTIN 1,250.00 1,400.00
 BLAKE 2,850.00
 CLARK 2,450.00
 SCOTT 3,000.00
 KING 5,000.00
 TURNER 1,500.00 .00
 ADAMS 1,100.00
 JAMES 950.00
 FORD 3,000.00
 MILLER 1,300.00
(14 rows)
```

## edb_stmt_level_tx

**Parameter type:** Boolean

**Default value:** `false`

**Range:** `{true | false}`

**Minimum scope of effect:** Per session

**When value changes take effect:** Immediate

**Required authorization to activate:** Session user

The term *statement-level transaction isolation* describes the behavior in which a runtime error occurs in a SQL command, and all the updates on the database caused by that single command are rolled back. For example, if a single `UPDATE` command successfully updates five rows, but an attempt to update a sixth row results in an exception, the updates to all six rows made by this `UPDATE` command are rolled back. The effects of prior SQL commands that haven't yet been committed or rolled back are pending until a `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` command is executed.

In EDB Postgres Advanced Server, if an exception occurs while executing a SQL command, all the updates on the database since the start of the transaction are rolled back. In addition, the transaction is left in an aborted state, and either a `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` command must be issued before another transaction can start.

If `edb_stmt_level_tx` is set to `TRUE`, then an exception doesn't roll back prior uncommitted database updates. If `edb_stmt_level_tx` is set to `FALSE`, then an exception rolls back uncommitted database updates.

!!! Note
    Use `edb_stmt_level_tx` set to `TRUE` only when necessary, as it can have have a negative performance impact.

This example, run in PSQL, shows that when `edb_stmt_level_tx` is `FALSE`, the abort of the second `INSERT` command also rolls back the first `INSERT` command. In PSQL, you must issue the command `\set AUTOCOMMIT off`. Otherwise every statement commits automatically, which doesn't show the effect of `edb_stmt_level_tx`.

```sql
\set AUTOCOMMIT off
SET edb_stmt_level_tx TO off;

INSERT INTO emp (empno,ename,deptno) VALUES (9001, 'JONES', 40);
INSERT INTO emp (empno,ename,deptno) VALUES (9002, 'JONES', 00);
ERROR:  insert or update on table "emp" violates foreign key constraint
"emp_ref_dept_fk"
DETAIL:  Key (deptno)=(0) is not present in table "dept".

COMMIT;
SELECT empno, ename, deptno FROM emp WHERE empno > 9000;
__OUTPUT__
empno  | ename | deptno
-------+-------+--------
(0 rows)
```

In this example, with `edb_stmt_level_tx` set to `TRUE`, the first `INSERT` command wasn't rolled back after the error on the second `INSERT` command. At this point, the first INSERT command can either be committed or rolled back.

```sql
\set AUTOCOMMIT off
SET edb_stmt_level_tx TO on;

INSERT INTO emp (empno,ename,deptno) VALUES (9001, 'JONES', 40);
INSERT INTO emp (empno,ename,deptno) VALUES (9002, 'JONES', 00);
ERROR:  insert or update on table "emp" violates foreign key constraint
"emp_ref_dept_fk"
DETAIL:  Key (deptno)=(0) is not present in table "dept"

SELECT empno, ename, deptno FROM emp WHERE empno > 9000;
__OUTPUT__
empno  | ename | deptno
-------+-------+--------
  9001 | JONES |     40
(1 row)

COMMIT;
```

If a `ROLLBACK` command is issued instead of the `COMMIT` command, the insert of employee number `9001` is rolled back as well.

## db_dialect

**Parameter type:** Enum

**Default value:** `postgres`

**Range:** `{postgres | redwood}`

**Minimum scope of effect:** Per session

**When value changes take effect:** Immediate

**Required authorization to activate:** Session user

In addition to the native PostgreSQL system catalog `pg_catalog`, EDB Postgres Advanced Server contains an extended catalog view. This is the `sys` catalog for the expanded catalog view. The `db_dialect` parameter controls the order in which these catalogs are searched for name resolution.

When set to `postgres`, the namespace precedence is `pg_catalog` and then `sys`, giving the PostgreSQL catalog the highest precedence. When set to `redwood`, the namespace precedence is `sys` and then `pg_catalog`, giving the expanded catalog views the highest precedence.

## default_with_rowids

**Parameter type:** Boolean

**Default value:** `false`

**Range:** `{true | false}`

**Minimum scope of effect:** Per session

**When value changes take effect:** Immediate

**Required authorization to activate:** Session user

When set to `on`, `CREATE TABLE` includes a `ROWID` column in newly created tables, which you can then reference in SQL commands. In earlier versions of EDB Postgres Advanced Server, `ROWIDs` were mapped to `OIDs`. With EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 12 and later, the `ROWID` is an autoincrementing value based on a sequence that starts with 1. It's assigned to each row of a table created with the `ROWIDs` option. By default, a unique index is created on a `ROWID` column.

The `ALTER` and `DROP` operations are restricted on a `ROWID` column.

To restore a database with `ROWIDs` with EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11 or an earlier version, you must perform the following:

-   `pg_dump`: If a table includes `OIDs` then specify `--convert-oids-to-rowids` to dump a database. Otherwise, ignore the `OIDs` to continue table creation on EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 12 and later.
-   `pg_upgrade`: Errors out. But if a table includes `OIDs` or `ROWIDs`, then you must perform the following:
    1.  Take a dump of the tables by specifying the `--convert-oids-to-rowids` option.
    2.  Drop the tables, and then perform the upgrade.
    3.  After the upgrade is successful, restore the dump into a new cluster that contains the dumped tables into a target database.

## optimizer_mode

**Parameter type:** Enum

**Default value:** `choose`

**Range:** `{choose | ALL_ROWS | FIRST_ROWS | FIRST_ROWS_10 | FIRST_ROWS_100 | FIRST_ROWS_1000}`

**Minimum scope of effect:** Per session

**When value changes take effect:** Immediate

**Required authorization to activate:** Session user

Sets the default optimization mode for analyzing optimizer hints.

The following table shows the possible values.

| Hint              | Description                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ALL_ROWS`        | Optimizes for retrieval of all rows of the result set.                                                                 |
| `CHOOSE`          | Does no default optimization based on assumed number of rows to retrieve from the result set. This is the default. |
| `FIRST_ROWS`      | Optimizes for retrieval of only the first row of the result set.                                                       |
| `FIRST_ROWS_10`   | Optimizes for retrieval of the first 10 rows of the results set.                                                       |
| `FIRST_ROWS_100`  | Optimizes for retrieval of the first 100 rows of the result set.                                                       |
| `FIRST_ROWS_1000` | Optimizes for retrieval of the first 1000 rows of the result set.                                                      |

These optimization modes are based on the assumption that the client submitting the SQL command is interested in viewing only the first `n` rows of the result set and then abandons the rest of the result set. Resources allocated to the query are adjusted as such.
