## About database object name display

When `edb_redwood_raw_names` is set to its default value of `FALSE`, database object names such as table names, column names, trigger names, program names, and user names appear in uppercase letters when viewed from Oracle catalogs. For a complete list of supported catalog views, see [Catalog views](../../oracle_compatibility_reference/epas_compat_cat_views/). In addition, quotation marks enclose names that were created with enclosing quotation marks.

When `edb_redwood_raw_names` is set to `TRUE`, the database object names are displayed exactly as stored in the PostgreSQL system catalogs when viewed from the Oracle catalogs. Thus, names created without quotation marks appear in lowercase as expected in PostgreSQL. Names created in quotation marks appear exactly as they were created but without the quotation marks.

## Example

For example, the following user name is created, and then a session is started with that user:

```sql
CREATE USER reduser IDENTIFIED BY password;
edb=# \c - reduser
Password for user reduser:
You are now connected to database "edb" as user "reduser".
```

When connected to the database as `reduser`, the following tables are created:

```sql
CREATE TABLE all_lower (col INTEGER);
CREATE TABLE ALL_UPPER (COL INTEGER);
CREATE TABLE "Mixed_Case" ("Col" INTEGER);
```

When viewed from the Oracle catalog `USER_TABLES` with `edb_redwood_raw_names` set to the default value `FALSE`, the names appear in upper case. The exception is the `Mixed_Case` name, which appears as created and also in quotation marks.

```sql
edb=> SELECT * FROM USER_TABLES;
__OUTPUT__
 schema_name  |  table_name  | tablespace_name | status | temporary
--------------+--------------+-----------------+--------+-----------
 REDUSER      | ALL_LOWER    |                 | VALID  | N
 REDUSER      | ALL_UPPER    |                 | VALID  | N
 REDUSER      | "Mixed_Case" |                 | VALID  | N
(3 rows)
```

When viewed with `edb_redwood_raw_names` set to `TRUE`, the names appear in lower case except for the `Mixed_Case` name. That name appears as created but without the quotation marks.

```sql
edb=> SET edb_redwood_raw_names TO true;
SET
edb=> SELECT * FROM USER_TABLES;
__OUTPUT__
 schema_name  | table_name | tablespace_name | status | temporary
--------------+------------+-----------------+--------+-----------
 reduser      | all_lower  |                 | VALID  | N
 reduser      | all_upper  |                 | VALID  | N
 reduser      | Mixed_Case |                 | VALID  | N
(3 rows)
```

These names now match the case when viewed from the PostgreSQL `pg_tables` catalog.

```sql
edb=> SELECT schemaname, tablename, tableowner FROM pg_tables WHERE
tableowner = 'reduser';
__OUTPUT__
 schemaname  | tablename  | tableowner
-------------+------------+------------
 reduser     | all_lower  | reduser
 reduser     | all_upper  | reduser
 reduser     | Mixed_Case | reduser
(3 rows)
```
