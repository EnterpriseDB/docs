<div id="sqlda_structure" class="registered_link"></div>

An embedded SQL statement allows your client application to interact with the server. An embedded directive is an instruction to the ECPGPlus compiler.

You can embed any EDB Postgres Advanced Server SQL statement in a C program. Each statement must begin with the keywords `EXEC SQL` and must be terminated with a semi-colon (;). In the C program, a SQL statement takes the form:

```sql
EXEC SQL <sql_command_body>;
```

Where `sql_command_body` represents a standard SQL statement. You can use a host variable anywhere that the SQL statement expects a value expression. For more information about substituting host variables for value expressions, see [Declaring host variables](/epas/latest/application_programming/ecpgplus_guide/03_using_embedded_sql/#declaring-host-variables).

ECPGPlus extends the PostgreSQL server-side syntax for some statements. Syntax differences are noted in the reference information that follows. For a complete reference to the supported syntax of other SQL commands, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-commands.html).

## ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR

Use the `ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR` statement to allocate an SQL descriptor area:

```sql
EXEC SQL [FOR <array_size>] ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>
    [WITH MAX <variable_count>];
```

Where:

-  `array_size` is a variable that specifies the number of array elements to allocate for the descriptor. `array_size` can be an `INTEGER` value or a host variable.
-  `descriptor_name` is the host variable that contains the name of the descriptor or the name of the descriptor. This value can take the form of an identifier, a quoted string literal, or of a host variable.
-  `variable_count` specifies the maximum number of host variables in the descriptor. The default value of `variable_count` is `100`.

The following code fragment allocates a descriptor named `emp_query` that can be processed as an array `(emp_array)`:

```sql
EXEC SQL FOR :emp_array ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR emp_query;
```

## CALL

Use the `CALL` statement to invoke a procedure or function on the server. The `CALL` statement works only on EDB Postgres Advanced Server. The `CALL` statement comes in two forms. The first form is used to call a function:

```sql
EXEC SQL CALL <program_name> '('[<actual_arguments>]')'
  INTO [[:<ret_variable>][: <ret_indicator>]];
```

The second form is used to call a procedure:

```sql
EXEC SQL CALL <program_name> '('[<actual_arguments>]')';
```

Where:

-  `program_name` is the name of the stored procedure or function that the `CALL` statement invokes. The program name can be schema qualified, package qualified, or both. If you don't specify the schema or package in which the program resides, ECPGPlus uses the value of `search_path` to locate the program.
-  `actual_arguments` specifies a comma-separated list of arguments required by the program. Each `actual_argument` corresponds to a formal argument expected by the program. Each formal argument can be an `IN` parameter, an `OUT` parameter, or an `INOUT` parameter.
-  `:ret_variable` specifies a host variable that receives the value returned if the program is a function.
-  `:ret_indicator` specifies a host variable that receives the indicator value returned if the program is a function.

For example, the following statement invokes the `get_job_desc` function with the value contained in the `:ename` host variable and captures the value returned by that function in the `:job` host variable:

```sql
EXEC SQL CALL get_job_desc(:ename)
  INTO :job;
```

## CLOSE

Use the `CLOSE` statement to close a cursor and free any resources currently in use by the cursor. A client application can't fetch rows from a closed cursor. The syntax of the `CLOSE` statement is:

```sql
EXEC SQL CLOSE [<cursor_name>];
```

Where `cursor_name` is the name of the cursor closed by the statement. The cursor name can take the form of an identifier or of a host variable.

The `OPEN` statement initializes a cursor. Once initialized, a cursor result set remains unchanged unless the cursor is reopened. You don't need to `CLOSE` a cursor before reopening it.

To manually close a cursor named `emp_cursor`, use the command:

```sql
EXEC SQL CLOSE emp_cursor;
```

A cursor is automatically closed when an application terminates.

## COMMIT

Use the `COMMIT` statement to complete the current transaction, making all changes permanent and visible to other users. The syntax is:

```sql
EXEC SQL [AT <database_name>] COMMIT [WORK]
         [COMMENT <'text'>] [COMMENT <'text'> RELEASE];
```

Where `database_name` is the name of the database or host variable that contains the name of the database in which the work resides. This value can take the form of an unquoted string literal or of a host variable.

For compatibility, ECPGPlus accepts the `COMMENT` clause without error but doesn't store any text included with the `COMMENT` clause.

Include the `RELEASE` clause to close the current connection after performing the commit.

For example, the following command commits all work performed on the `dept` database and closes the current connection:

```sql
EXEC SQL AT dept COMMIT RELEASE;
```

By default, statements are committed only when a client application performs a `COMMIT` statement. Include the `-t` option when invoking ECPGPlus to specify for a client application to invoke `AUTOCOMMIT` functionality. You can also control `AUTOCOMMIT` functionality in a client application with the following statements:

```sql
EXEC SQL SET AUTOCOMMIT TO ON
```

and

```sql
EXEC SQL SET AUTOCOMMIT TO OFF
```

## CONNECT

Use the `CONNECT` statement to establish a connection to a database. The `CONNECT` statement is available in two forms. One form is compatible with Oracle databases, and the other is not.

The first form is compatible with Oracle databases:

```sql
EXEC SQL CONNECT
  {{:<user_name> IDENTIFIED BY :<password>}  | :<connection_id>}
  [AT <database_name>]
  [USING :database_string]
  [ALTER AUTHORIZATION :new_password];
```

Where:

-  `user_name` is a host variable that contains the role that the client application uses to connect to the server.
-  `password` is a host variable that contains the password associated with that role.
-  `connection_id` is a host variable that contains a slash-delimited user name and password used to connect to the database.

Include the `AT` clause to specify the database to which the connection is established. `database_name` is the name of the database to which the client is connecting. Specify the value in the form of a variable or as a string literal.

Include the `USING` clause to specify a host variable that contains a null-terminated string identifying the database to which to establish the connection.

The `ALTER AUTHORIZATION` clause is supported for syntax compatibility only. ECPGPlus parses the `ALTER AUTHORIZATION` clause and reports a warning.

Using the first form of the `CONNECT` statement, a client application might establish a connection with a host variable named `user` that contains the identity of the connecting role and a host variable named `password` that contains the associated password using the following command:

```text
EXEC SQL CONNECT :user IDENTIFIED BY :password;
```

A client application can also use the first form of the `CONNECT` statement to establish a connection using a single host variable named `:connection_id`. In the following example, `connection_id` contains the slash-delimited role name and associated password for the user:

```sql
EXEC SQL CONNECT :connection_id;
```

The syntax of the second form of the `CONNECT` statement is:

```sql
EXEC SQL CONNECT TO <database_name>
[AS <connection_name>] [<credentials>];
```

Where `credentials` is one of the following:

```sql
USER user_name password
USER user_name IDENTIFIED BY password
USER user_name USING password
```

In the second form:

`database_name` is the name or identity of the database to which the client is connecting. Specify `database_name` as a variable or as a string literal in one of the following forms:

```text
<database_name>[@<hostname>][:<port>]

tcp:postgresql://<hostname>[:<port>][/<database_name>][options]

unix:postgresql://<hostname>[:<port>][/<database_name>][options]
```

Where:

-  `hostname` is the name or IP address of the server on which the database resides.
-  `port` is the port on which the server listens.

  You can also specify a value of `DEFAULT` to establish a connection with the default database, using the default role name. If you specify `DEFAULT` as the target database, don't include a `connection_name` or `credentials`.

-  `connection_name` is the name of the connection to the database. `connection_name` takes the form of an identifier (that is, not a string literal or a variable). You can open multiple connections by providing a unique `connection_name` for each connection.

  If you don't specify a name for a connection, `ecpglib` assigns a name of `DEFAULT` to the connection. You can refer to the connection by name (`DEFAULT`) in any `EXEC SQL` statement.

-  `CURRENT` is the most recently opened or the connection mentioned in the most-recent `SET CONNECTION TO` statement. If you don't refer to a connection by name in an `EXEC SQL` statement, ECPG assumes the name of the connection to be `CURRENT`.

-  `user_name` is the role used to establish the connection with the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database. The privileges of the specified role are applied to all commands performed through the connection.

-  `password` is the password associated with the specified `user_name`.

The following code fragment uses the second form of the `CONNECT` statement to establish a connection to a database named `edb` using the role `alice` and the password associated with that role, `1safepwd`:

```sql
EXEC SQL CONNECT TO edb AS acctg_conn
  USER 'alice' IDENTIFIED BY '1safepwd';
```

The name of the connection is `acctg_conn`. You can use the connection name when changing the connection name using the `SET CONNECTION` statement.

## DEALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR

Use the `DEALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR` statement to free memory in use by an allocated descriptor. The syntax of the statement is:

```sql
EXEC SQL DEALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>
```

Where `descriptor_name` is the name of the descriptor. This value can take the form of a quoted string literal or of a host variable.

The following example deallocates a descriptor named `emp_query`:

```sql
EXEC SQL DEALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR emp_query;
```

## DECLARE CURSOR

Use the `DECLARE CURSOR` statement to define a cursor. The syntax of the statement is:

```sql
EXEC SQL [AT <database_name>] DECLARE <cursor_name> CURSOR FOR
(<select_statement> | <statement_name>);
```

Where:

-  `database_name` is the name of the database on which the cursor operates. This value can take the form of an identifier or of a host variable. If you don't specify a database name, the default value of `database_name` is the default database.
-  `cursor_name` is the name of the cursor.
-  `select_statement` is the text of the `SELECT` statement that defines the cursor result set. The `SELECT` statement can't contain an `INTO` clause.
-  `statement_name` is the name of a SQL statement or block that defines the cursor result set.

The following example declares a cursor named `employees`:

```sql
EXEC SQL DECLARE employees CURSOR FOR
  SELECT
    empno, ename, sal, comm
  FROM
    emp;
```

The cursor generates a result set that contains the employee number, employee name, salary, and commission for each employee record that's stored in the `emp` table.

## DECLARE DATABASE

Use the `DECLARE DATABASE` statement to declare a database identifier for use in subsequent SQL statements (for example, in a `CONNECT` statement). The syntax is:

```sql
EXEC SQL DECLARE <database_name> DATABASE;
```

Where `database_name` specifies the name of the database.

The following example shows declaring an identifier for the `acctg` database:

```sql
EXEC SQL DECLARE acctg DATABASE;
```

After invoking the command declaring `acctg` as a database identifier, you can reference the `acctg` database by name when establishing a connection or in `AT` clauses.

This statement has no effect and is provided for Pro\*C compatibility only.

## DECLARE STATEMENT

Use the `DECLARE STATEMENT` directive to declare an identifier for an SQL statement. EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports two versions of the `DECLARE STATEMENT` directive:

```sql
EXEC SQL [<database_name>] DECLARE <statement_name> STATEMENT;
```

and

```sql
EXEC SQL DECLARE STATEMENT <statement_name>;
```

Where:

-  `statement_name` specifies the identifier associated with the statement.
-  `database_name` specifies the name of the database. This value may take the form of an identifier or of a host variable that contains the identifier.

A typical usage sequence that includes the `DECLARE STATEMENT` directive is:

```sql
EXEC SQL DECLARE give_raise STATEMENT;      // give_raise is now a statement
handle (not prepared)
EXEC SQL PREPARE give_raise FROM :stmtText; // give_raise is now associated
with a statement
EXEC SQL EXECUTE give_raise;
```

This statement has no effect and is provided for Pro\*C compatibility only.

## DELETE

Use the `DELETE` statement to delete one or more rows from a table. The syntax for the ECPGPlus `DELETE` statement is the same as the syntax for the SQL statement, but you can use parameter markers and host variables any place that an expression is allowed. The syntax is:

```sql
[FOR <exec_count>] DELETE FROM [ONLY] <table> [[AS] <alias>]
  [USING <using_list>]
  [WHERE <condition> | WHERE CURRENT OF <cursor_name>]
  [{RETURNING|RETURN} * | <output_expression> [[AS] <output_name>]
[, ...] INTO <host_variable_list> ]
```

-  Include the `FOR exec_count` clause to specify the number of times the statement executes. This clause is valid only if the `VALUES` clause references an array or a pointer to an array.
-  `table` is the name (optionally schema qualified) of an existing table. Include the `ONLY` clause to limit processing to the specified table. If you don't include the `ONLY` clause, any tables inheriting from the named table are also processed.
-  `alias` is a substitute name for the target table.
-  `using_list` is a list of table expressions, allowing columns from other tables to appear in the `WHERE` condition.
-  Include the `WHERE` clause to specify the rows to delete. If you don't include a `WHERE` clause in the statement, `DELETE` deletes all rows from the table, leaving the table definition intact.
-  `condition` is an expression, host variable, or parameter marker that returns a value of type `BOOLEAN`. Those rows for which `condition` returns true are deleted.
-  `cursor_name` is the name of the cursor to use in the `WHERE CURRENT OF` clause. The row to be deleted is the one most recently fetched from this cursor. The cursor must be a nongrouping query on the `DELETE` statements target table. You can't specify `WHERE CURRENT OF` in a `DELETE` statement that includes a Boolean condition.

The `RETURN/RETURNING` clause specifies an `output_expression` or `host_variable_list` that's returned by the `DELETE` command after each row is deleted:

  -   `output_expression` is an expression to be computed and returned by the `DELETE` command after each row is deleted. `output_name` is the name of the returned column. Include \* to return all columns.
  -   `host_variable_list` is a comma-separated list of host variables and optional indicator variables. Each host variable receives a corresponding value from the `RETURNING` clause.

For example, the following statement deletes all rows from the `emp` table, where the `sal` column contains a value greater than the value specified in the host variable, `:max_sal:`

```sql
DELETE FROM emp WHERE sal > :max_sal;
```

For more information about using the `DELETE` statement, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-delete.html).

## DESCRIBE

Use the `DESCRIBE` statement to find the number of input values required by a prepared statement or the number of output values returned by a prepared statement. The `DESCRIBE` statement is used to analyze a SQL statement whose shape is unknown at the time you write your application.

The `DESCRIBE` statement populates an `SQLDA` descriptor. To populate a SQL descriptor, use the `ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR` and `DESCRIBE...DESCRIPTOR` statements.

```sql
EXEC SQL DESCRIBE BIND VARIABLES FOR <statement_name> INTO <descriptor>;
```


```sql
EXEC SQL DESCRIBE SELECT LIST FOR <statement_name> INTO <descriptor>;
```

Where:

-  `statement_name` is the identifier associated with a prepared SQL statement or PL/SQL block.
-  `descriptor` is the name of C variable of type `SQLDA*`. You must allocate the space for the descriptor by calling `sqlald()` and initialize the descriptor before executing the `DESCRIBE` statement.

When you execute the first form of the `DESCRIBE` statement, ECPG populates the given descriptor with a description of each input variable *required* by the statement. For example, given two descriptors:

```sql
SQLDA *query_values_in;
SQLDA *query_values_out;
```

You might prepare a query that returns information from the `emp` table:

```sql
EXEC SQL PREPARE get_emp FROM
  "SELECT ename, empno, sal FROM emp WHERE empno = ?";
```

The command requires one input variable for the parameter marker (?).

```sql
EXEC SQL DESCRIBE BIND VARIABLES
  FOR get_emp INTO query_values_in;
```

After describing the bind variables for this statement, you can examine the descriptor to find the number of variables required and the type of each variable.

When you execute the second form, ECPG populates the given descriptor with a description of each value returned by the statement. For example, the following statement returns three values:

```sql
EXEC SQL DESCRIBE SELECT LIST
  FOR get_emp INTO query_values_out;
```

After describing the select list for this statement, you can examine the descriptor to find the number of returned values and the name and type of each value.

Before executing the statement, you must bind a variable for each input value and a variable for each output value. The variables that you bind for the input values specify the actual values used by the statement. The variables that you bind for the output values tell ECPGPlus where to put the values when you execute the statement.

This is alternative Pro\*C-compatible syntax for the `DESCRIBE DESCRIPTOR` statement.

## DESCRIBE DESCRIPTOR

Use the `DESCRIBE DESCRIPTOR` statement to retrieve information about a SQL statement and store that information in a SQL descriptor. Before using `DESCRIBE DESCRIPTOR`, you must allocate the descriptor with the `ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR` statement. The syntax is:

```sql
EXEC SQL DESCRIBE [INPUT | OUTPUT] <statement_identifier>
  USING [SQL] DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>;
```

Where:

-  `statement_name` is the name of a prepared SQL statement.
-  `descriptor_name` is the name of the descriptor. `descriptor_name` can be a quoted string value or a host variable that contains the name of the descriptor.

If you include the `INPUT` clause, ECPGPlus populates the given descriptor with a description of each input variable required by the statement.

For example, given two descriptors:

```sql
EXEC SQL ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR query_values_in;
EXEC SQL ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR query_values_out;
```

You might prepare a query that returns information from the `emp` table:

```sql
EXEC SQL PREPARE get_emp FROM
  "SELECT ename, empno, sal FROM emp WHERE empno = ?";
```

The command requires one input variable for the parameter marker (?).

```sql
EXEC SQL DESCRIBE INPUT get_emp USING 'query_values_in';
```

After describing the bind variables for this statement, you can examine the descriptor to find the number of variables required and the type of each variable.

If you don't specify the `INPUT` clause, `DESCRIBE DESCRIPTOR` populates the specified descriptor with the values returned by the statement.

If you include the `OUTPUT` clause, ECPGPlus populates the given descriptor with a description of each value returned by the statement.

For example, the following statement returns three values:

```sql
EXEC SQL DESCRIBE OUTPUT FOR get_emp USING 'query_values_out';
```

After describing the select list for this statement, you can examine the descriptor to find the number of returned values and the name and type of each value.

## DISCONNECT

Use the `DISCONNECT` statement to close the connection to the server. The syntax is:

```sql
EXEC SQL DISCONNECT [<connection_name>][CURRENT][DEFAULT][ALL];
```

Where `connection_name` is the connection name specified in the `CONNECT` statement used to establish the connection. If you don't specify a connection name, the current connection is closed.

Include the `CURRENT` keyword to specify for ECPGPlus to close the connection used most recently.

Include the `DEFAULT` keyword to specify for ECPGPlus to close the connection named `DEFAULT`. If you don't specify a name when opening a connection, ECPGPlus assigns the name `DEFAULT` to the connection.

Include the `ALL` keyword to close all active connections.

The following example creates a connection named `hr_connection` that connects to the `hr` database and then disconnects from the connection:

```c
/* client.pgc*/
int main()
{
    EXEC SQL CONNECT TO hr AS connection_name;
    EXEC SQL DISCONNECT connection_name;
    return(0);
}
```

## EXECUTE

Use the `EXECUTE` statement to execute a statement previously prepared using an `EXEC SQL PREPARE` statement. The syntax is:

```sql
EXEC SQL [FOR <array_size>] EXECUTE <statement_name>
  [USING {DESCRIPTOR <SQLDA_descriptor>
  |: <host_variable> [[INDICATOR] :<indicator_variable>]}];
```

Where:

-  `array_size` is an integer value or a host variable that contains an integer value that specifies the number of rows to process. If you omit the `FOR` clause, the statement is executed once for each member of the array.
-  `statement_name` specifies the name assigned to the statement when the statement was created using the `EXEC SQL PREPARE` statement.

Include the `USING` clause to supply values for parameters in the prepared statement:

-   Include the `DESCRIPTOR` `SQLDA_descriptor` clause to provide an SQLDA descriptor value for a parameter.
-   Use a `host_variable` (and an optional `indicator_variable`) to provide a user-specified value for a parameter.

The following example creates a prepared statement that inserts a record into the `emp` table:

```sql
EXEC SQL PREPARE add_emp (numeric, text, text, numeric) AS
    INSERT INTO emp VALUES($1, $2, $3, $4);
```

Each time you invoke the prepared statement, provide fresh parameter values for the statement:

```sql
EXEC SQL EXECUTE add_emp USING 8000, 'DAWSON', 'CLERK', 7788;
EXEC SQL EXECUTE add_emp USING 8001, 'EDWARDS', 'ANALYST', 7698;
```

## EXECUTE DESCRIPTOR

Use the `EXECUTE` statement to execute a statement previously prepared by an `EXEC SQL PREPARE` statement, using an SQL descriptor. The syntax is:

```sql
EXEC SQL [FOR <array_size>] EXECUTE <statement_identifier>
  [USING [SQL] DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>]
  [INTO [SQL] DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>];
```

Where:

-  `array_size` is an integer value or a host variable that contains an integer value that specifies the number of rows to process. If you omit the `FOR` clause, the statement is executed once for each member of the array.
-  `statement_identifier` specifies the identifier assigned to the statement with the `EXEC SQL PREPARE` statement.
-  `descriptor_name` specifies the name of a descriptor (as a single-quoted string literal), or a host variable that contains the name of a descriptor.

Include the `USING` clause to specify values for any input parameters required by the prepared statement.

Include the `INTO` clause to specify a descriptor into which the `EXECUTE` statement writes the results returned by the prepared statement.

The following example executes the prepared statement, `give_raise`, using the values contained in the descriptor `stmtText:`

```sql
EXEC SQL PREPARE give_raise FROM :stmtText;
EXEC SQL EXECUTE give_raise USING DESCRIPTOR :stmtText;
```

## EXECUTE...END EXEC

Use the `EXECUTE…END-EXEC` statement to embed an anonymous block into a client application. The syntax is:

```sql
EXEC SQL [AT <database_name>] EXECUTE <anonymous_block> END-EXEC;
```

Where:

-  `database_name` is the database identifier or a host variable that contains the database identifier. If you omit the `AT` clause, the statement executes on the current default database.
-  `anonymous_block` is an inline sequence of PL/pgSQL or SPL statements and declarations. You can include host variables and optional indicator variables in the block. Each such variable is treated as an `IN/OUT` value.

The following example executes an anonymous block:

```sql
EXEC SQL EXECUTE
  BEGIN
    IF (current_user = :admin_user_name) THEN
      DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('You are an administrator');
    END IF;
END-EXEC;
```

!!! Note
    The `EXECUTE…END EXEC` statement is supported only by EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

## EXECUTE IMMEDIATE

Use the `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` statement to execute a string that contains a SQL command. The syntax is:

```sql
EXEC SQL [AT <database_name>] EXECUTE IMMEDIATE <command_text>;
```

Where:

-  `database_name` is the database identifier or a host variable that contains the database identifier. If you omit the `AT` clause, the statement executes on the current default database.
-  `command_text` is the command executed by the `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` statement.

This dynamic SQL statement is useful when you don't know the text of an SQL statement when writing a client application. For example, a client application might prompt a trusted user for a statement to execute. After the user provides the text of the statement as a string value, the statement is then executed with an `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` command.

The statement text can't contain references to host variables. If the statement might contain parameter markers or returns one or more values, use the `PREPARE` and `DESCRIBE` statements.

The following example executes the command contained in the `:command_text` host variable:

```sql
EXEC SQL EXECUTE IMMEDIATE :command_text;
```

## FETCH

Use the `FETCH` statement to return rows from a cursor into an SQLDA descriptor or a target list of host variables. Before using a `FETCH` statement to retrieve information from a cursor, you must prepare the cursor using `DECLARE` and `OPEN` statements. The statement syntax is:

```sql
EXEC SQL [FOR <array_size>] FETCH <cursor>
  { USING DESCRIPTOR <SQLDA_descriptor> }|{ INTO <target_list> };
```

Where:

-  `array_size` is an integer value or a host variable that contains an integer value specifying the number of rows to fetch. If you omit the `FOR` clause, the statement is executed once for each member of the array.
-  `cursor` is the name of the cursor from which rows are being fetched or a host variable that contains the name of the cursor.

If you include a `USING` clause, the `FETCH` statement populates the specified SQLDA descriptor with the values returned by the server.

If you include an `INTO` clause, the `FETCH` statement populates the host variables (and optional indicator variables) specified in the `target_list`.

The following code fragment declares a cursor named `employees` that retrieves the `employee number`, `name`, and `salary` from the `emp` table:

```sql
EXEC SQL DECLARE employees CURSOR FOR
    SELECT empno, ename, esal FROM emp;
EXEC SQL OPEN emp_cursor;
EXEC SQL FETCH emp_cursor INTO :emp_no, :emp_name, :emp_sal;
```

## FETCH DESCRIPTOR

Use the `FETCH DESCRIPTOR` statement to retrieve rows from a cursor into an SQL descriptor. The syntax is:

```sql
EXEC SQL [FOR <array_size>] FETCH <cursor>
  INTO [SQL] DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>;
```

Where:

-  `array_size` is an integer value or a host variable that contains an integer value specifying the number of rows to fetch. If you omit the `FOR` clause, the statement is executed once for each member of the array.
-  `cursor` is the name of the cursor from which rows are fetched or a host variable that contains the name of the cursor. The client must `DECLARE` and `OPEN` the cursor before calling the `FETCH DESCRIPTOR` statement.
-  `descriptor_name` specifies the name of a descriptor (as a single-quoted string literal) or a host variable that contains the name of a descriptor. Prior to use, the descriptor must be allocated using an `ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR` statement.

Include the `INTO` clause to specify a SQL descriptor into which the `EXECUTE` statement writes the results returned by the prepared statement. 

The following example allocates a descriptor named `row_desc` that holds the description and the values of a specific row in the result set. It then declares and opens a cursor for a prepared statement (`my_cursor`), before looping through the rows in result set, using a `FETCH` to retrieve the next row from the cursor into the descriptor:

```sql
EXEC SQL ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR 'row_desc';
EXEC SQL DECLARE my_cursor CURSOR FOR query;
EXEC SQL OPEN my_cursor;

for( row = 0; ; row++ )
{
  EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
    int col;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;
EXEC SQL FETCH my_cursor INTO SQL DESCRIPTOR 'row_desc';
```

## GET DESCRIPTOR

Use the `GET DESCRIPTOR` statement to retrieve information from a descriptor. The `GET DESCRIPTOR` statement comes in two forms. The first form returns the number of values (or columns) in the descriptor.

```sql
EXEC SQL GET DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>
  :<host_variable> = COUNT;
```

The second form returns information about a specific value (specified by the `VALUE column_number` clause):

```sql
EXEC SQL [FOR <array_size>] GET DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>
  VALUE <column_number> {:<host_variable> = <descriptor_item> {,…}};
```

Where:

-  `array_size` is an integer value or a host variable that contains an integer value that specifies the number of rows to process. If you specify an `array_size`, the `host_variable` must be an array of that size. For example, if `array_size` is `10`, `:host_variable` must be a 10-member array of `host_variables`. If you omit the `FOR` clause, the statement is executed once for each member of the array.
-  `descriptor_name` specifies the name of a descriptor as a single-quoted string literal or a host variable that contains the name of a descriptor.

Include the `VALUE` clause to specify the information retrieved from the descriptor.

-   `column_number` identifies the position of the variable in the descriptor.
-   `host_variable` specifies the name of the host variable that receives the value of the item.
-   `descriptor_item` specifies the type of the retrieved descriptor item.

ECPGPlus implements the following `descriptor_item` types:

-   `TYPE`
-   `LENGTH`
-   `OCTET_LENGTH`
-   `RETURNED_LENGTH`
-   `RETURNED_OCTET_LENGTH`
-   `PRECISION`
-   `SCALE`
-   `NULLABLE`
-   `INDICATOR`
-   `DATA`
-   `NAME`

The following code fragment shows using a `GET DESCRIPTOR` statement to obtain the number of columns entered in a user-provided string:

```sql
EXEC SQL ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR parse_desc;
EXEC SQL PREPARE query FROM :stmt;
EXEC SQL DESCRIBE query INTO SQL DESCRIPTOR parse_desc;
EXEC SQL GET DESCRIPTOR parse_desc :col_count = COUNT;
```

The example allocates an SQL descriptor named `parse_desc` before using a `PREPARE` statement to check the syntax of the string provided by the user `:stmt`. A `DESCRIBE` statement moves the user-provided string into the descriptor, `parse_desc`. The call to `EXEC SQL GET DESCRIPTOR` interrogates the descriptor to discover the number of columns `(:col_count)` in the result set.

## INSERT

Use the `INSERT` statement to add one or more rows to a table. The syntax for the ECPGPlus `INSERT` statement is the same as the syntax for the SQL statement, but you can use parameter markers and host variables any place that a value is allowed. The syntax is:

```sql
[FOR <exec_count>] INSERT INTO <table> [(<column> [, ...])]
  {DEFAULT VALUES |
   VALUES ({<expression> | DEFAULT} [, ...])[, ...] | <query>}
  [RETURNING * | <output_expression> [[ AS ] <output_name>] [, ...]]
```

Include the `FOR exec_count` clause to specify the number of times the statement executes. This clause is valid only if the `VALUES` clause references an array or a pointer to an array.

-  `table` specifies the (optionally schema-qualified) name of an existing table.
-  `column` is the name of a column in the table. The column name can be qualified with a subfield name or array subscript. Specify the `DEFAULT VALUES` clause to use default values for all columns.
-  `expression` is the expression, value, host variable, or parameter marker that's assigned to the corresponding column. Specify `DEFAULT` to fill the corresponding column with its default value.
-  `query` specifies a `SELECT` statement that supplies the rows to insert.
-  `output_expression` is an expression that's computed and returned by the `INSERT` command after each row is inserted. The expression can refer to any column in the table. Specify \* to return all columns of the inserted rows.
-  `output_name` specifies a name to use for a returned column.

The following example adds a row to the `employees` table:

```sql
INSERT INTO emp (empno, ename, job, hiredate)
    VALUES ('8400', :ename, 'CLERK', '2011-10-31');
```

!!! Note
    The `INSERT` statement uses a host variable `:ename` to specify the value of the `ename` column.

For more information about using the `INSERT` statement, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-insert.html).

## OPEN

Use the `OPEN` statement to open a cursor. The syntax is:

```sql
EXEC SQL [FOR <array_size>] OPEN <cursor> [USING <parameters>];
```

`parameters` is one of the following:

```sql
DESCRIPTOR <SQLDA_descriptor>
```

or

```sql
<host_variable> [ [ INDICATOR ] <indicator_variable>, … ]
```

Where:

-  `array_size` is an integer value or a host variable that contains an integer value specifying the number of rows to fetch. If you omit the `FOR` clause, the statement is executed once for each member of the array.
-  `cursor` is the name of the cursor being opened.
-  `parameters` is either `DESCRIPTOR SQLDA_descriptor` or a comma-separated list of `host variables` and optional `indicator variables` that initialize the cursor. If specifying an `SQLDA_descriptor`, the descriptor must be initialized with a `DESCRIBE` statement.

The `OPEN` statement initializes a cursor using the values provided in `parameters`. Once initialized, the cursor result set remains unchanged unless the cursor is closed and reopened. A cursor is automatically closed when an application terminates.

The following example declares a cursor named `employees` that queries the `emp` table. It returns the `employee number`, `name`, `salary`, and `commission` of an employee whose name matches a user-supplied value stored in the host variable `:emp_name`.

```sql
EXEC SQL DECLARE employees CURSOR FOR
  SELECT
    empno, ename, sal, comm 
  FROM 
    emp
  WHERE ename = :emp_name;
EXEC SQL OPEN employees;
...
```

After declaring the cursor, the example uses an `OPEN` statement to make the contents of the cursor available to a client application.

## OPEN DESCRIPTOR

Use the `OPEN DESCRIPTOR` statement to open a cursor with a SQL descriptor. The syntax is:

```sql
EXEC SQL [FOR <array_size>] OPEN <cursor>
  [USING [SQL] DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>]
  [INTO [SQL] DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>];
```

Where:

-  `array_size` is an integer value or a host variable that contains an integer value specifying the number of rows to fetch. If you omit the `FOR` clause, the statement is executed once for each member of the array.
-  `cursor` is the name of the cursor being opened.
-  `descriptor_name` specifies the name of an SQL descriptor in the form of a single-quoted string literal or a host variable that contains the name of an SQL descriptor that contains the query that initializes the cursor.

For example, the following statement opens a cursor named `emp_cursor` using the host variable `:employees`:

```sql
EXEC SQL OPEN emp_cursor USING DESCRIPTOR :employees;
```

## PREPARE

Prepared statements are useful when a client application must perform a task multiple times. The statement is parsed, written, and planned only once rather than each time the statement is executed. This approach saves repetitive processing time.

Use the `PREPARE` statement to prepare a SQL statement or PL/pgSQL block for execution. The statement is available in two forms. The first form is:

```sql
EXEC SQL [AT <database_name>] PREPARE <statement_name>
  FROM <sql_statement>;
```

The second form is:

```sql
EXEC SQL [AT <database_name>] PREPARE <statement_name>
  AS <sql_statement>;
```

Where:

-  `database_name` is the database identifier or a host variable that contains the database identifier against which the statement executes. If you omit the `AT` clause, the statement executes against the current default database.
-  `statement_name` is the identifier associated with a prepared SQL statement or PL/SQL block.
-  `sql_statement` can take the form of a `SELECT` statement, a single-quoted string literal, or a host variable that contains the text of an SQL statement.

To include variables in a prepared statement, substitute placeholders (`$1, $2, $3`, and so on) for statement values that might change when you `PREPARE` the statement. When you `EXECUTE` the statement, provide a value for each parameter. Provide the values in the order in which they replace placeholders.

The following example creates a prepared statement named `add_emp` that inserts a record into the `emp` table:

```sql
EXEC SQL PREPARE add_emp (int, text, text, numeric) AS
    INSERT INTO emp VALUES($1, $2, $3, $4);
```

Each time you invoke the statement, provide fresh parameter values for the statement:

```sql
EXEC SQL EXECUTE add_emp(8003, 'Davis', 'CLERK', 2000.00);
EXEC SQL EXECUTE add_emp(8004, 'Myer', 'CLERK', 2000.00);
```

!!! Note
    A client application must issue a `PREPARE` statement in each session in which a statement executes. Prepared statements persist only for the duration of the current session.

## ROLLBACK

Use the `ROLLBACK` statement to abort the current transaction and discard any updates made by the transaction. The syntax is:

```sql
EXEC SQL [AT <database_name>] ROLLBACK [WORK]
  [ { TO [SAVEPOINT] <savepoint> } | RELEASE ]
```

Where `database_name` is the database identifier or a host variable that contains the database identifier against which the statement executes. If you omit the `AT` clause, the statement executes against the current default database.

Include the `TO` clause to abort any commands that executed after the specified `savepoint`. Use the `SAVEPOINT` statement to define the `savepoint`. If you omit the `TO` clause, the `ROLLBACK` statement aborts the transaction, discarding all updates.

Include the `RELEASE` clause to cause the application to execute an `EXEC SQL COMMIT RELEASE` and close the connection.

Use the following statement to roll back a complete transaction:

```sql
EXEC SQL ROLLBACK;
```

Invoking this statement aborts the transaction, undoing all changes, erasing any savepoints, and releasing all transaction locks. Suppose you include a savepoint (`my_savepoint` in the following example):

```sql
EXEC SQL ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
```

Only the portion of the transaction that occurred after the `my_savepoint` is rolled back. `my_savepoint` is retained, but any savepoints created after `my_savepoint` are erased.

Rolling back to a specified savepoint releases all locks acquired after the savepoint.

## SAVEPOINT

Use the `SAVEPOINT` statement to define a *savepoint*. A savepoint is a marker in a transaction. You can use a `ROLLBACK` statement to abort the current transaction, returning the state of the server to its condition prior to the specified savepoint. The syntax of a `SAVEPOINT` statement is:

```sql
EXEC SQL [AT <database_name>] SAVEPOINT <savepoint_name>
```

Where:

-  `database_name` is the database identifier or a host variable that contains the database identifier against which the savepoint resides. If you omit the `AT` clause, the statement executes against the current default database.
-  `savepoint_name` is the name of the savepoint. If you reuse a `savepoint_name`, the original savepoint is discarded.

You can establish savepoints only in a transaction block. A transaction block can contain multiple savepoints.

To create a savepoint named `my_savepoint`, include the statement:

```sql
EXEC SQL SAVEPOINT my_savepoint;
```

## SELECT

ECPGPlus extends support of the `SQL SELECT` statement by providing the `INTO host_variables` clause. The clause allows you to select specified information from an EDB Postgres Advanced Server database into a host variable. The syntax for the `SELECT` statement is:

```sql
EXEC SQL [AT <database_name>]
SELECT
  [ <hint> ]
  [ ALL | DISTINCT [ ON( <expression>, ...) ]]
  select_list INTO <host_variables>
  
  [ FROM from_item [, from_item ]...]
  [ WHERE condition ]
  [ hierarchical_query_clause ]
  [ GROUP BY expression [, ...]]
  [ HAVING condition ]
  [ { UNION [ ALL ] | INTERSECT | MINUS } (subquery) ]
  [ ORDER BY expression [order_by_options]]
  [ LIMIT { count | ALL }]
  [ OFFSET start [ ROW | ROWS ] ]
  [ FETCH { FIRST | NEXT } [ count ] { ROW | ROWS } ONLY ]
  [ FOR { UPDATE | SHARE } [OF table_name [, ...]][NOWAIT ][...]]
```

Where:

-  `database_name` is the name of the database or host variable that contains the name of the database in which the table resides. This value can take the form of an unquoted string literal or of a host variable.
-  `host_variables` is a list of host variables populated by the `SELECT` statement. If the `SELECT` statement returns more than a single row, `host_variables` must be an array.

ECPGPlus provides support for the additional clauses of the SQL `SELECT` statement as documented in the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-select.html).

To use the `INTO host_variables` clause, include the names of defined host variables when specifying the `SELECT` statement. For example, the following `SELECT` statement populates the `:emp_name` and `:emp_sal` host variables with a list of employee names and salaries:

```sql
EXEC SQL SELECT ename, sal
  INTO :emp_name, :emp_sal
  FROM emp
  WHERE empno = 7988;
```

The enhanced `SELECT` statement also allows you to include parameter markers (question marks) in any clause where a value is allowed. For example, the following query contains a parameter marker in the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE dept_no = ?;
```

This `SELECT` statement allows you to provide a value at runtime for the `dept_no` parameter marker.

## SET CONNECTION

There are at least three reasons you might need more than one connection in a given client application:

-   You might want different privileges for different statements.
-   You might need to interact with multiple databases in the same client.
-   Multiple threads of execution in a client application can't share a connection concurrently.

The syntax for the `SET CONNECTION` statement is:

```sql
EXEC SQL SET CONNECTION <connection_name>;
```

Where `connection_name` is the name of the connection to the database.

To use the `SET CONNECTION` statement, open the connection to the database using the second form of the `CONNECT` statement. Include the `AS` clause to specify a `connection_name`.

By default, the current thread uses the current connection. Use the `SET CONNECTION` statement to specify a default connection for the current thread to use. The default connection is used only when you execute an `EXEC SQL` statement that doesn't explicitly specify a connection name. For example, the following statement uses the default connection because it doesn't include an `AT connection_name` clause:

```sql
EXEC SQL DELETE FROM emp;
```

This statement doesn't use the default connection because it specifies a connection name using the `AT connection_name` clause:

```sql
EXEC SQL AT acctg_conn DELETE FROM emp;
```

For example, suppose a client application creates and maintains multiple connections using either of the following approaches:

```sql
EXEC SQL CONNECT TO edb AS acctg_conn
  USER 'alice' IDENTIFIED BY 'acctpwd';
```


```sql
EXEC SQL CONNECT TO edb AS hr_conn
  USER 'bob' IDENTIFIED BY 'hrpwd';
```

It can change between the connections with the `SET CONNECTION` statement:

```sql
SET CONNECTION acctg_conn;
```

or

```sql
SET CONNECTION hr_conn;
```

The server uses the privileges associated with the connection when determining the privileges available to the connecting client. When using the `acctg_conn` connection, the client has the privileges associated with the role `alice`. When connected using `hr_conn`, the client has the privileges associated with `bob`.

## SET DESCRIPTOR

Use the `SET DESCRIPTOR` statement to assign a value to a descriptor area using information provided by the client application in the form of a host variable or an integer value. The statement comes in two forms. The first form is:

```sql
EXEC SQL [FOR <array_size>] SET DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>
  VALUE <column_number> <descriptor_item> = <host_variable>;
```

The second form is:

```sql
EXEC SQL [FOR <array_size>] SET DESCRIPTOR <descriptor_name>
  COUNT = integer;
```

Where:

-  `array_size` is an integer value or a host variable that contains an integer value specifying the number of rows to fetch. If you omit the `FOR` clause, the statement executes once for each member of the array.
-  `descriptor_name` specifies the name of a descriptor as a single-quoted string literal or a host variable that contains the name of a descriptor.

Include the `VALUE` clause to describe the information stored in the descriptor.

-   `column_number` identifies the position of the variable within the descriptor.
-   `descriptor_item` specifies the type of the descriptor item.
-   `host_variable` specifies the name of the host variable that contains the value of the item.

ECPGPlus implements the following `descriptor_item` types:

-   `TYPE`
-   `LENGTH`
-   `[REF] INDICATOR`
-   `[REF] DATA`
-   `[REF] RETURNED LENGTH`

For example, a client application might prompt a user for a dynamically created query:

```c
query_text = promptUser("Enter a query");
```

To execute a dynamically created query, you must first prepare the query (parsing and validating the syntax of the query) and then describe the input parameters found in the query using the `EXEC SQL DESCRIBE INPUT` statement.

```sql
EXEC SQL ALLOCATE DESCRIPTOR query_params;
EXEC SQL PREPARE emp_query FROM :query_text;

EXEC SQL DESCRIBE INPUT emp_query
  USING SQL DESCRIPTOR 'query_params';
```

After describing the query, the `query_params` descriptor contains information about each parameter required by the query.

For this example, assume that the user entered:

```sql
SELECT ename FROM emp WHERE sal > ? AND job = ?;,
```

In this case, the descriptor describes two parameters, one for `sal > ?` and one for `job = ?`.

To discover the number of parameter markers (question marks) in the query and therefore the number of values you must provide before executing the query, use:

```sql
EXEC SQL GET DESCRIPTOR … :host_variable = COUNT;
```

Then, you can use `EXEC SQL GET DESCRIPTOR` to retrieve the name of each parameter. You can also use `EXEC SQL GET DESCRIPTOR` to retrieve the type of each parameter from the descriptor, along with the number of parameters. Or you can supply each `value` in the form of a character string and ECPG converts that string into the required data type.

The data type of the first parameter is `numeric`. The type of the second parameter is `varchar`. The name of the first parameter is `sal`. The name of the second parameter is `job`.

Next, loop through each parameter, prompting the user for a value, and store those values in host variables. You can use `GET DESCRIPTOR … COUNT` to find the number of parameters in the query.

```sql
EXEC SQL GET DESCRIPTOR 'query_params'
  :param_count = COUNT;

for(param_number = 1;
    param_number <= param_count;
    param_number++)
{
```

Use `GET DESCRIPTOR` to copy the name of the parameter into the `param_name` host variable:

```sql
EXEC SQL GET DESCRIPTOR 'query_params'
  VALUE :param_number :param_name = NAME;

reply = promptUser(param_name);
if (reply == NULL)
 reply_ind = 1; /* NULL */
else
 reply_ind = 0; /* NOT NULL */
```

To associate a `value` with each parameter, you use the `EXEC SQL SET DESCRIPTOR` statement. For example:

```sql
EXEC SQL SET DESCRIPTOR 'query_params'
  VALUE :param_number DATA = :reply;
EXEC SQL SET DESCRIPTOR 'query_params'
  VALUE :param_number INDICATOR = :reply_ind;
}
```

Now, you can use the `EXEC SQL EXECUTE DESCRIPTOR` statement to execute the prepared statement on the server.

## UPDATE

Use an `UPDATE` statement to modify the data stored in a table. The syntax is:

```sql
EXEC SQL [AT <database_name>][FOR <exec_count>]
    UPDATE [ ONLY ] table [ [ AS ] alias ]
    SET {column = { expression | DEFAULT } |
        (column [, ...]) = ({ expression|DEFAULT } [, ...])} [, ...]
    [ FROM from_list ]
    [ WHERE condition | WHERE CURRENT OF cursor_name ]
    [ RETURNING * | output_expression [[ AS ] output_name] [, ...] ]
```

Where `database_name` is the name of the database or host variable that contains the name of the database in which the table resides. This value can take the form of an unquoted string literal or of a host variable.

Include the `FOR exec_count` clause to specify the number of times the statement executes. This clause is valid only if the `SET` or `WHERE` clause contains an array.

ECPGPlus provides support for the additional clauses of the SQL `UPDATE` statement as documented in the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-update.html).

You can use a host variable in any clause that specifies a value. To use a host variable, substitute a defined variable for any value associated with any of the documented `UPDATE` clauses.

The following `UPDATE` statement changes the job description of an employee (identified by the `:ename` host variable) to the value contained in the `:new_job` host variable. It increases the employees salary by multiplying the current salary by the value in the `:increase` host variable:

```sql
EXEC SQL UPDATE emp
  SET job = :new_job, sal = sal * :increase
  WHERE ename = :ename;
```

The enhanced `UPDATE` statement also allows you to include parameter markers (question marks) in any clause where an input value is permitted. For example, we can write the same update statement with a parameter marker in the `WHERE` clause:

```sql
EXEC SQL UPDATE emp
  SET job = ?, sal = sal * ?
  WHERE ename = :ename;
```

This `UPDATE` statement allows you to prompt the user for a new value for the `job` column and provide the amount by which the `sal` column is incremented for the employee specified by `:ename`.

## WHENEVER

Use the `WHENEVER` statement to specify the action taken by a client application when it encounters an SQL error or warning. The syntax is:

```sql
EXEC SQL WHENEVER <condition> <action>;
```

The following table describes the different conditions that might trigger an `action`.

| Condition     | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `NOT FOUND`   | The server returns a `NOT FOUND` condition when it encounters a `SELECT` that returns no rows or when a `FETCH` reaches the end of a result set. |
| `SQLERROR`    | The server returns an `SQLERROR` condition when it encounters a serious error returned by an SQL statement.                                       |
| `SQLWARNING`  | The server returns an `SQLWARNING` condition when it encounters a nonfatal warning returned by an SQL statement.                                 |

The following table describes the actions that result from a client encountering a `condition`.

| Action                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CALL function [([args])]`    | Call the named `function`.                                                                                                                                              |
| `CONTINUE`                    | Proceed to the next statement.                                                                                                                                          |
| `DO BREAK`                    | Emit a C break statement. A break statement can appear in a `loop` or a `switch` statement. If executed, the break statement terminates the `loop` or the `switch` statement. |
| `DO CONTINUE`                 | Emit a C `continue` statement. A `continue` statement can exist only in a loop. If executed, it causes the flow of control to return to the top of the loop.   |
| `DO function ([args])`        | Call the named `function`.                                                                                                                                              |
| `GOTO label` or `GO TO label` | Proceed to the statement that contains the label.                                                                                                                     |
| `SQLPRINT`                    | Print a message to standard error.                                                                                                                                      |
| `STOP`                        | Stop executing.                                                                                                                                                         |
