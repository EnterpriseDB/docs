## EDB Postgres Advanced Server keywords

A keyword is a word that's recognized by the EDB Postgres Advanced Server parser as having a special meaning or association. You can use the `pg_get_keywords()` function to retrieve an up-to-date list of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server keywords:

```sql
acctg=#
acctg=# SELECT * FROM pg_get_keywords();
__OUTPUT__
        word         | catcode |          catdesc
---------------------+---------+---------------------------------
 abort               | U       | unreserved
 absolute            | U       | unreserved
 access              | U       | unreserved
...
```

`pg_get_keywords` returns a table containing the keywords recognized by EDB Postgres Advanced Server:

-   The `word` column displays the keyword.
-   The `catcode` column displays a category code.
-   The `catdesc` column displays a brief description of the category to which the keyword belongs.

You can use any character in an identifier if the name is enclosed in double quotes. You can selectively query the `pg_get_keywords()` function to retrieve an up-to-date list of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server keywords that belong to a specific category:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pg_get_keywords() WHERE catcode = 'code';
```

Where `code` is:

`R` &mdash; The word is reserved. You can never use reserved keywords as an identifier. They are reserved for use by the server.

`U` &mdash; The word is unreserved. Unreserved words are used internally in some contexts, but you can use them as a name for a database object.

`T` &mdash; The word is used internally but can be used as a name for a function or type.

`C` &mdash; The word is used internally and can't be used as a name for a function or type.

For more information about EDB Postgres Advanced Server identifiers and keywords, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-syntax-lexical.html).
