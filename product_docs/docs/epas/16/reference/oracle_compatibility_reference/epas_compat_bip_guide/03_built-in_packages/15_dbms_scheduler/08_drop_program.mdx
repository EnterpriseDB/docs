The `DROP_PROGRAM` procedure drops a program. The signature of the `DROP_PROGRAM` procedure is:

```sql
DROP_PROGRAM(
  <program_name> IN VARCHAR2,
  <force> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE)
```

## Parameters

`program_name`

 `program_name` specifies the name of the program that's being dropped.

`force`

 `force` is a Boolean value that tells the server how to handle programs with dependent jobs.

-   Specify `FALSE` to return an error if the program is referenced by a job.

-   Specify `TRUE` to disable any jobs that reference the program before dropping the program.

  The default value is `FALSE`.

## Example

The following call to `DROP_PROGRAM` drops a job named `update_emp`:

```sql
DBMS_SCHEDULER.DROP_PROGRAM('update_emp');
```
