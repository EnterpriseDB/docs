The `DBMS_JOB` package's jobs are scheduled and run in the background by the `edb_job_scheduler` extension. For more information, see [EDB Job Scheduler extension](/pg_extensions/edb_job_scheduler).

The `DBMS_JOB` package lets you create, schedule, and manage jobs. A job runs a stored procedure that was previously stored in the database. The `SUBMIT` procedure creates and stores a job definition. A job identifier is assigned to a job with a stored procedure and the attributes describing when and how often to run the job.
 
EDB Postgres Advanced Server's implementation of `DBMS_JOB` is a partial implementation when compared to Oracle's version. The following table lists the supported `DBMS_JOB` procedures.

| Function/procedure                                               | Return type | Description                                                                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BROKEN(job, broken [, next_date ])`                             | n/a         | Specify that a given job is either broken or not broken.                                                                                                    |
| `CHANGE(job, what, next_date, interval, instance, force)`        | n/a         | Change the job’s parameters.                                                                                                                                |
| `INTERVAL(job, interval)`                                        | n/a         | Set the execution frequency by means of a date function that is recalculated each time the job is run. This value becomes the next date/time for execution. |
| `NEXT_DATE(job, next_date)`                                      | n/a         | Set the next date/time to run the job.                                                                                                                |
| `REMOVE(job)`                                                    | n/a         | Delete the job definition from the database.                                                                                                                |
| `RUN(job)`                                                       | n/a         | Force execution of a job even if it's marked broken.                                                                                                      |
| `SUBMIT(job OUT, what [, next_date [, interval [, no_parse ]]])` | n/a         | Create a job and store its definition in the database.                                                                                                    |
| `WHAT(job, what)`                                                | n/a         | Change the stored procedure run by a job.                                                                                                                   |

When and how often a job runs depends on two interacting parameters: `next_date` and `interval`. The `next_date` parameter is a date/time value that specifies the next date/time to execute the job. The `interval` parameter is a string that contains a date function that evaluates to a date/time value.

Before the job executes, the expression in the `interval` parameter is evaluated. The resulting value replaces the `next_date` value stored with the job. The job is then executed. The expression in `interval` is repeatedly reevaluated before each job executes, supplying the `next_date` date/time for the next execution.

These examples use the stored procedure `job_proc`. The procedure inserts a timestamp into the table `jobrun`, which contains a single column, `VARCHAR2`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE jobrun (
    runtime VARCHAR2(40)
);

CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE job_proc
IS
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO jobrun VALUES ('job_proc run at ' || TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,
        'yyyy-mm-dd hh24:mi:ss'));
END;
```
