Built-in packages are provided with EDB Postgres Advanced Server. For certain packages, non-superusers must be explicitly granted the `EXECUTE` privilege on the package before using any of the package’s functions or procedures. For most of the built-in packages, `EXECUTE` privilege is granted to `PUBLIC` by default.

For information about using the `GRANT` command to provide access to a package, see [SQL reference](../../epas_compat_sql/).

All built-in packages are owned by the special `sys` user that must be specified when granting or revoking privileges on built-in packages:

```sql
GRANT EXECUTE ON PACKAGE SYS.UTL_FILE TO john;
```
