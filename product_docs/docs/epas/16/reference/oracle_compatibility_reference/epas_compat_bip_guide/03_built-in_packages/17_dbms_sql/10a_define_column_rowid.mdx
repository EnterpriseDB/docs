title: "DEFINE_COLUMN_ROWID"
---

The `DEFINE_COLUMN_ROWID` procedure defines a column of the type `ROWID` in the `SELECT` list to be returned and retrieved in a cursor.

!!! Note 
In EDB Postgres Advanced Server, `ROWID` is a a domain rather than a bigint.  

When you use this procedure the column you are defining is identified by its relative position in the SELECT list of the statement in the specified cursor. The COLUMN value type determines the type of column being defined.

```sql
DEFINE_COLUMN_RAW(<c> NUMBER, <position> NUMBER, <column> NUMBER)
```

## Parameters

`c`

 Cursor ID of the cursor from which a row is selected.

`position`

 Relative position of the column in the row being defined. The first column in a statement has position 1.

`column`

 Value of the column. The type of this value determines the type for the column being defined.
