## Name

`CREATE [PUBLIC] DATABASE LINK` &mdash; Create a database link.

## Synopsis

```sql
CREATE [ PUBLIC ] DATABASE LINK <name>
  CONNECT TO { CURRENT_USER |
               <username> IDENTIFIED BY '<password>'}
  USING { postgres_fdw '<fdw_connection_string>' |
        [ oci ] '<oracle_connection_string>' }
```

## Description

`CREATE DATABASE LINK` creates a database link. A database link is an object that allows a reference to a table or view in a remote database in a `DELETE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT` or `UPDATE` command. Reference a database link by appending `@dblink` to the table or view name referenced in the SQL command, where `dblink` is the name of the database link.

Database links can be *public* or *private*. A public database link is one that any user can use. Only the database link's owner can use a private database link. Specify the `PUBLIC` option to create a public database link. Otherwise, a private database link is created.

When you use the `CREATE DATABASE LINK` command, the database link name and the given connection attributes are stored in the EDB Postgres Advanced Server system table named `pg_catalog.edb_dblink`. When using a given database link, the database containing the `edb_dblink` entry defining this database link is called the *local database*. The server and database whose connection attributes are defined in the `edb_dblink` entry is called the *remote database*. You can use `edb_dblink_oci` to access remote Oracle tables and views using any `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement.
 
You must be connected to the local database when you issue a SQL command containing a reference to a database link. When the SQL command executes, the appropriate authentication and connection is made to the remote database to access the table or view to which the `@dblink` reference is appended.

!!!note "Oracle compatibility"
-  For EDB Postgres Advanced Server 16, the CREATE DATABASE LINK command has been tested and certified with all the minor versions for use with Oracle versions 10g Release 2, 11g Release 2, 12c Release 1, 18c Release 1, 19c, 21c, and 23.
!!!
    
!!!note
- You can't use a database link to access a remote database in a standby database server. Standby database servers are for high availability, load balancing, and replication.
  
  For information about high availability, load balancing, and replication for Postgres database servers, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/high-availability.html).
-  You can set the `edb_dblink_oci.rescans` GUC to `SCROLL` or `SERIALIZABLE` at the server level in the `postgresql.conf` file. You can also set it at the session level using the `SET` command. However, the setting isn't applied to existing dblink connections due to dblink connection caching.
-  When executing `SELECT` on LOB data of more than 4000 characters, we recommend using `edb_dblink_oci.rescans=serializable` to free up the temporary PGA memory and avoid exceeding `PGA_AGGREGATE_LIMIT`.
!!!
    
The `edb_dblink_oci` supports both types of rescans: `SCROLL` and `SERIALIZABLE`. By default it's set to `SERIALIZABLE`. When set to `SERIALIZABLE`, `edb_dblink_oci` uses the `SERIALIZABLE` transaction isolation level on the Oracle side, which corresponds to PostgreSQL’s `REPEATABLE READ`. This is necessary because a single PostgreSQL statement can lead to multiple Oracle queries. It thereby uses a serializable isolation level to provide consistent results.

A serialization failure can occur when modifying a table concurrent with long-running DML transactions, for example, `ADD`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements. If such a failure occurs, the OCI reports `ORA-08177: can't serialize access for this transaction`, and the application must retry the transaction.

A `SCROLL` rescan is quick, but each iteration resets the current row position to `1`. A `SERIALIZABLE` rescan has performance benefits over a `SCROLL` rescan.

## Parameters

`PUBLIC`

 Create a public database link that any user can use. If you omit this parameter, then the database link is private and only the database link’s owner can use it.

`name`

 The name of the database link.

`username`

 The username to use for connecting to the remote database.

`CURRENT_USER`

 Include `CURRENT_USER` to use the user mapping associated with the role that's using the link when establishing a connection to the remote server.

`password`

 The password for `username`.

`postgres_fdw`

 Specifies foreign data wrapper `postgres_fdw` as the connection to a remote EDB Postgres Advanced Server database. If `postgres_fdw` isn't installed on the database, use the `CREATE EXTENSION` command to install `postgres_fdw`. For more information, see the `CREATE EXTENSION` command in the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createextension.html).

`fdw_connection_string`

 Specifies the connection information for the `postgres_fdw` foreign data wrapper.

`oci`

 Specifies a connection to a remote Oracle database. This is the default behavior.

`oracle_connection_string`

 Specifies the connection information for an oci connection.

!!! Note

    To create a non-public database link, you need the `CREATE DATABASE LINK` privilege. To create a public database link, you need the `CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK` privilege.

## Setting up an Oracle instant client for OCI database link

To use `edb_dblink_oci`, you must download and install an Oracle instant client on the host running the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database in which you want to create the database link.

You can download an instant client [here](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-097480.html).

### Oracle instant client for Linux

These instructions apply to Linux hosts running EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

Be sure the `libaio` library (the Linux-native asynchronous I/O facility) is installed on the Linux host running EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

You can install the `libaio` library with the following command:

```shell
yum install libaio
```

If the Oracle instant client that you downloaded doesn't include the file named `libclntsh.so` without a version number suffix, create a symbolic link named `libclntsh.so` that points to the downloaded version of the library file. To do so, navigate to the instant client directory and execute the following command:

```shell
ln -s libclntsh.so.<version> libclntsh.so
```

Where `version` is the version number of the `libclntsh.so` library. For example:

```shell
ln -s libclntsh.so.12.1 libclntsh.so
```

When executing a SQL command that references a database link to a remote Oracle database, EDB Postgres Advanced Server must know where the Oracle instant client library resides on the EDB Postgres Advanced Server host.

The `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable must include the path to the Oracle client installation directory containing the `libclntsh.so` file. For example, if the installation directory containing `libclntsh.so` is `/tmp/instantclient`, use:

```shell
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/instantclient:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Alternatively, you can set the value of the `oracle_home` configuration parameter in the
`postgresql.conf` file. The `oracle_home` configuration parameter is an alternative to the
`LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable. For more details on the `oracle_home` configuration
parameter, see [configuration parameters](../../database_administrator_reference/01_introduction/05_oracle_home/).

The `ORACLE_HOME` environment variable must be set and include the path to the Oracle home directory. For example, 

```text
export ORACLE_HOME=/opt/product/version/dbhomeXE
```

!!! Note
    You must set either the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` or the `oracle_home` configuration parameter and the `ORACLE_HOME` environment variable before executing the `pg_ctl` utility to start or restart EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

If you're running the current session as the user account (for example, `enterprisedb`) that directly invokes `pg_ctl` to start or restart EDB Postgres Advanced Server, then set either the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable or the `oracle_home` configuration parameter and the `ORACLE_HOME` environment variable before invoking `pg_ctl`.

You can set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and the `ORACLE_HOME` environment variable in the `.bash_profile` file under the home directory of the `enterprisedb` user account. That is, set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `ORACLE_HOME` in the file `~enterprisedb/.bash_profile`. This setting ensures that `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `ORACLE_HOME` are set when you log in as `enterprisedb`.

If you're using a Linux service script with the `systemctl` or `service` command to start or restart EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you must set `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` and `ORACLE_HOME` so it's in effect when the script invokes the `pg_ctl` utility.

For example, to set an environment variable for EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you can create a file named `/etc/systemd/system/edb-as-14.service`. Include `/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-14.service` in the file.

If the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/instantclient`, include the environment variable by specifying:

```shell
[Service]
Environment=LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/tmp/instantclient:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
Environment=ORACLE_HOME=/tmp/instantclient
```

Reload systemd:

```shell
systemctl daemon-reload
```

Restart the EDB Postgres Advanced Server service:

```shell
systemctl restart edb-as-14
```

The script file that you need to modify to include the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` setting depends on the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version and the Linux system on which it was installed.


### Oracle instant client for Windows

These instructions apply to Windows hosts running EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

When you're executing a SQL command that references a database link to a remote Oracle database, EDB Postgres Advanced Server must know where the Oracle instant client library resides on the EDB Postgres Advanced Server host.

Set the Windows `PATH` system environment variable to include the Oracle client installation directory that contains the `oci.dll` file.

Alternatively, you can set the value of the `oracle_home` configuration parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file. The value specified in the `oracle_home` configuration parameter overrides the Windows `PATH` environment variable.

To set the `oracle_home` configuration parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file, add the following line:

```ini
oracle_home = 'lib_directory'
```

Substitute the name of the Windows directory that contains `oci.dll` for `lib_directory`. For example:

```ini
oracle_home = 'C:/tmp/instantclient_10_2'
```

After setting the `PATH` environment variable or the `oracle_home` configuration parameter, you must restart the server for the changes to take effect. Restart the server from the Windows Services console.

!!! Note
    If `tnsnames.ora` is configured in failover mode, and a client:server failure occurs, the client connection is established with a secondary server (usually a backup server). Later, when the primary server resumes, the client retains its connection to a secondary server until a new session is established. The new client connections is automatically established with the primary server. If the primary and secondary servers are out of sync, then the clients that established a connection to the secondary server and the clients that later connected to the primary server might see a different database view.

## Examples

### Creating an OCI database link

This example uses the `CREATE DATABASE LINK` command to create a database link named `chicago` that connects an instance of EDB Postgres Advanced Server to an Oracle server using an `edb_dblink_oci` connection. The connection information tells EDB Postgres Advanced Server to log in to Oracle as the user `admin` whose password is `mypassword`. Including the `oci` option tells EDB Postgres Advanced Server that this is an `edb_dblink_oci` connection. The connection string `'//127.0.0.1/acctg'` specifies the server address and name of the database.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE LINK chicago
  CONNECT TO admin IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword'
  USING oci '//127.0.0.1/acctg';
```

!!! Note
    You can specify a hostname in the connection string in place of an IP address.

### Creating a postgres_fdw database link

This example uses the `CREATE DATABASE LINK` command to create a database link named `bedford`. The database link connects an instance of EDB Postgres Advanced Server to another EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance by way of a `postgres_fdw` foreign data wrapper connection. The connection information tells EDB Postgres Advanced Server to log in as the user `admin` with the password `mypassword`. Including the `postgres_fdw` option tells EDB Postgres Advanced Server that this is a `postgres_fdw` connection. The connection string, `'host=127.0.0.1 port=5444 dbname=marketing'` specifies the server address and name of the database.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE LINK bedford
  CONNECT TO admin IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword'
  USING postgres_fdw 'host=127.0.0.1 port=5444 dbname=marketing';
```

!!! Note
    You can specify a hostname in the connection string in place of an IP address.

## Using a database link

These examples use a database link with EDB Postgres Advanced Server to connect to an Oracle database. The examples assume that a copy of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server sample application’s `emp` table was created in an Oracle database. A second EDB Postgres Advanced Server database cluster with the sample application is accepting connections at port `5443`.

Create a public database link, named `oralink`, to an Oracle database named `xe` located at `127.0.0.1` on port `1521`. Connect to the Oracle database with the username `edb` and password `password`.

```sql
CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK oralink CONNECT TO edb IDENTIFIED BY 'password'
USING '//127.0.0.1:1521/xe';
```

Issue a `SELECT` command on the `emp` table in the Oracle database using the database link `oralink`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM emp@oralink;
__OUTPUT__
 empno | ename  |    job    | mgr  |      hiredate      | sal  | comm | deptno

Create a private database link, named `fdwlink`, to the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database named `edb` located on host `192.168.2.22` running on port `5444`. Connect to the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database with the username `enterprisedb` and password `password`.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE LINK fdwlink CONNECT TO enterprisedb IDENTIFIED BY
'password' USING postgres_fdw 'host=192.168.2.22 port=5444 dbname=edb';
```

Display attributes of database links `oralink` and `fdwlink` from the local `edb_dblink` system table:

```sql
SELECT lnkname, lnkuser, lnkconnstr FROM pg_catalog.edb_dblink;
__OUTPUT__
 lnkname |   lnkuser    |               lnkconnstr
---------+--------------+----------------------------------------
 oralink | edb          | //127.0.0.1:1521/xe
 fdwlink | enterprisedb |
(2 rows)
```

Perform a join of the `emp` table from the Oracle database with the `dept` table from the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database:

```sql
SELECT d.deptno, d.dname, e.empno, e.ename, e.job, e.sal, e.comm FROM
emp@oralink e, dept@fdwlink d WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno ORDER BY 1, 3;
__OUTPUT__

## Push down for an OCI database link

When the OCI database link is used to execute SQL statements on a remote Oracle database, sometimes the *pushdown* of the processing occurs on the foreign server.

Push down refers to the occurrence of processing on the foreign that is, remote server instead of the local client where the SQL statement was issued. Push down can result in performance improvement since the data is processed on the remote server before being returned to the local client.

OCI database link supports push down for
- WHERE clause 
- JOIN operations
- AGGREGATE functions
- ORDER BY clause

For push down to occur, some basic conditions must be met. The tables involved in the join operation must belong to the same foreign server and use the identical connection information to the foreign server. This connection information is the same database link defined with the `CREATE DATABASE LINK` command.

To determine whether to use push down for a SQL statement, display the execution plan by using the `EXPLAIN` command. For information about the `EXPLAIN` command, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-explain.html).

You can restrict the push downs using the `edb_dbLink_oci_pushdown.config` configuration file. You can define the list of functions and operators in this file that can push down to the remote server. You can easily add or modify the list as per the requirements.

This file lists the objects as aggregates, functions, and operators allowed to push down to the remote server. Put each entry on a single line. Each entry must have two columns:
-   Object type that can be ROUTINE (functions, aggregates, and procedures) or OPERATOR.
-   The second column is schema-qualified object names with their arguments.

You can format the second column using the following query:

For ROUTINES:

```sql
SELECT pronamespace::regnamespace || '.' || oid::regprocedure FROM pg_proc
WHERE proname = '<routine_name>'
```

For OPERATORS:

```sql
SELECT oprnamespace::regnamespace || '.' || oid::regoperator FROM pg_operator
WHERE oprname = '<operator_name>'
```

Example of `edb_dbLink_oci_pushdown.config` file:

```shell
ROUTINE pg_catalog.sum(bigint)
ROUTINE pg_catalog.sum(smallint)
ROUTINE pg_catalog.to_number(text)
ROUTINE pg_catalog.to_number(text,text)
OPERATOR pg_catalog.=(integer,integer)
OPERATOR pg_catalog.=(text,text)
OPERATOR pg_catalog.=(smallint,integer)
OPERATOR pg_catalog.=(bigint,integer)
OPERATOR pg_catalog.=(numeric,numeric)
```

To find out whether pushdown is used for a SQL statement, display the execution plan by using the `EXPLAIN` command.

These examples use the following database link:

```sql
CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK oralink CONNECT TO edb IDENTIFIED BY 'password'
USING '//192.168.2.23:1521/xe';
```

This example shows the execution plan of an inner join:

```sql

   Remote Query: SELECT department_id, count(*), sum(salary), avg(salary), min(salary), max(salary), round(stddev(salary), 0) FROM employees WHERE (department_id < 50) GROUP BY department_id ORDER BY department_id ASC NULLS LAST
(4 rows)
```

This example shows a case where the entire processing isn't pushed down because the `emp` joined table resides locally instead of on the same foreign server:

```sql
EXPLAIN (verbose,costs off) SELECT d.deptno, d.dname, e.empno, e.ename FROM
dept@oralink d LEFT OUTER JOIN emp e ON d.deptno = e.deptno ORDER BY 1, 3;

                            QUERY PLAN
------------------------------------------------------------------
 Sort
   Output: d.deptno, d.dname, e.empno, e.ename
   Sort Key: d.deptno, e.empno
   ->  Hash Left Join
         Output: d.deptno, d.dname, e.empno, e.ename
         Hash Cond: (d.deptno = e.deptno)
         ->  Foreign Scan on _dblink_dept_1 d
               Output: d.deptno, d.dname, d.loc
               Remote Query: SELECT deptno, dname, NULL FROM dept
         ->  Hash
               Output: e.empno, e.ename, e.deptno
               ->  Seq Scan on public.emp e
                     Output: e.empno, e.ename, e.deptno
(13 rows)
```

The output of this join is the same as the previous left-outer-join example.

## Creating a foreign table from a database link

!!! Note
    This procedure isn't compatible with Oracle databases.

After you create a database link, you can create a foreign table based on this database link. You can then use the foreign table to access the remote table, referencing it with the foreign table name instead of using the database link syntax. Using the database link requires appending `@dblink` to the table or view name referenced in the SQL command, where `dblink` is the name of the database link.

You can use this technique for either an oci-dblink connection for remote Oracle access or a `postgres_fdw` connection for remote Postgres access.

This example creates a foreign table to access a remote Oracle table.

The following creates a database link named `oralink` for connecting to the Oracle database:

```sql
CREATE PUBLIC DATABASE LINK oralink CONNECT TO edb IDENTIFIED BY 'password'
USING '//127.0.0.1:1521/xe';
```

The following query shows the database link:

```sql
SELECT lnkname, lnkuser, lnkconnstr FROM pg_catalog.edb_dblink;
__OUTPUT__
 lnkname | lnkuser |     lnkconnstr
---------+---------+---------------------
 oralink | edb     | //127.0.0.1:1521/xe
(1 row)
```

When you create the database link, EDB Postgres Advanced Server creates a corresponding foreign server. The following query displays the foreign server:

```sql
SELECT srvname, srvowner, srvfdw, srvtype, srvoptions FROM
pg_foreign_server;
__OUTPUT__
 srvname | srvowner | srvfdw | srvtype |          srvoptions
---------+----------+--------+---------+-------------------------------
 oralink |       10 |  14005 |         | {connstr=//127.0.0.1:1521/xe}
(1 row)
```

For more information about foreign servers, see the `CREATE SERVER` command in the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createserver.html).

Create the foreign table:

```sql
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE emp_ora (
    empno           NUMERIC(4),
    ename           VARCHAR(10),
    job             VARCHAR(9),
    mgr             NUMERIC(4),
    hiredate        TIMESTAMP WITHOUT TIME ZONE,
    sal             NUMERIC(7,2),
    comm            NUMERIC(7,2),
    deptno          NUMERIC(2)
)
  SERVER oralink
  OPTIONS (table_name 'emp', schema_name 'edb'
);
```

Note the following in the `CREATE FOREIGN TABLE` command:

-   The name specified in the `SERVER` clause at the end of the `CREATE FOREIGN TABLE` command is the name of the foreign server, which is `oralink` in this example. You can see this name in the `srvname` column from the query on `pg_foreign_server`.
-   The table name and schema name are specified in the `OPTIONS` clause by the `table` and `schema` options.
-   The column names specified in the `CREATE FOREIGN TABLE` command must match the column names in the remote table.
-   Generally, `CONSTRAINT` clauses can't be accepted or enforced on the foreign table. They are assumed to have been defined on the remote table.

For more information about the `CREATE FOREIGN TABLE` command, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createforeigntable.html).

The following is a query on the foreign table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM emp_ora;
__OUTPUT__
 empno | ename  |    job    | mgr  |      hiredate      |   sal   |  comm   | deptno

In contrast, the following is a query on the same remote table but using the database link instead of the foreign table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM emp@oralink;

(14 rows)
```

!!! Note
    For backward compatibility, you can still write `USING libpq` instead of `USING postgres_fdw`. However, the `libpq` connector is missing important optimizations that the `postgres_fdw` connector has. Therefore, use the `postgres_fdw` connector when possible. The `libpq` option is deprecated and might be removed in a future EDB Postgres Advanced Server release.
