## Name

`CREATE ROLE` &mdash; Define a new database role.

## Synopsis

```sql
CREATE ROLE <name> [IDENTIFIED BY <password> [REPLACE old_password]]
```

## Description

`CREATE ROLE` adds a role to the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database cluster. A role is an entity that can own database objects and have database privileges. A role can be considered a user, a group, or both depending on how you use it. The new role doesn't have the `LOGIN` attribute, so you can't use it to start a session. (Use the `ALTER ROLE` command to give the role `LOGIN` rights.) You must have `CREATEROLE` privilege or be a database superuser to use `CREATE ROLE`.

If you specify the `IDENTIFIED BY` clause, the `CREATE ROLE` command also creates a schema owned by and with the same name as the newly created role.

!!! Note
    The roles are defined at the database cluster level, making them valid in all databases in the cluster.

## Parameters

`name`

 The name of the new role.

`IDENTIFIED BY password`

 Sets the role’s password. A password is needed only for roles having the `LOGIN` attribute, but you can stil define one for roles without it. If you don't plan to use password authentication, you can omit this option.

## Notes

Use `ALTER ROLE` to change the attributes of a role. Use `DROP ROLE` to remove a role. You can mmodify the attributes specified by `CREATE ROLE` using `ALTER ROLE` commands.

Use `GRANT` and `REVOKE` to add and remove members of roles that are being used as groups.

The maximum length limit for role name and password is 63 characters.

## Examples

Create a role and a schema named `admins` with a password:

```sql
CREATE ROLE admins IDENTIFIED BY Rt498zb;
```
