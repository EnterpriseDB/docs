## Name

`CREATE SEQUENCE` &mdash; Define a new sequence generator.

## Synopsis

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE <name> [ INCREMENT BY <increment> ]
  [ { NOMINVALUE | MINVALUE <minvalue> } ]
  [ { NOMAXVALUE | MAXVALUE <maxvalue> } ]
  [ START WITH <start> ] [ CACHE <cache> | NOCACHE ] [ CYCLE ]
```

## Description

`CREATE SEQUENCE` creates a sequence number generator. This process involves creating and initializing a special single-row table with the specified name. The generator is owned by the user who created it.

If you include a schema name, then the sequence is created in the specified schema. Otherwise it's created in the current schema. The sequence name differ from the name of any other sequence, table, index, or view in the same schema.

After you create a sequence, use the functions `NEXTVAL` and `CURRVAL` to operate on it. These functions are documented in [SQL reference](../../sql_reference/03_functions_and_operators/09_sequence_manipulation_functions/).

## Parameters

`name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the sequence to create.

`increment`

 The optional clause `INCREMENT BY increment` specifies the value to add to the current sequence value to create a new value. Use a positive value to create ascending sequence and a negative value to create a descending sequence. The default value is `1`.

`NOMINVALUE | MINVALUE minvalue`

 The optional clause `MINVALUE minvalue` determines the minimum value a sequence can generate. The defaults are 1 for ascending and -2<sup>63</sup>-1 for descending sequences. You can use the keywords `NOMINVALUE` to set this behavior to the default.

`NOMAXVALUE | MAXVALUE maxvalue`

 The optional clause `MAXVALUE maxvalue` determines the maximum value for the sequence. The defaults are 2<sup>63</sup>-1 for ascending and -1 for descending sequences. You can use the keywords `NOMAXVALUE` to set this behavior to the default.

`start`

 The optional clause `START WITH start` allows the sequence to begin anywhere. The default starting value is `minvalue` for ascending sequences and `maxvalue` for descending ones.

`cache`

 The optional clause `CACHE cache` specifies how many sequence numbers to preallocate and store in memory for faster access. The minimum value is `1`, which is also the default. This setting generates only one value at a time, that is, `NOCACHE`.

`CYCLE`

 The `CYCLE` option allows the sequence to wrap around when the `maxvalue` or `minvalue` is reached by an ascending or descending sequence, respectively. If the limit is reached, the next number generated is `minvalue` or `maxvalue`, respectively.

 If you omit `CYCLE`, any calls to `NEXTVAL` after the sequence reaches its maximum value return an error. You can use the keywords `NO CYCLE` to use the default behavior. However, this term isn't compatible with Oracle databases.

## Notes

Sequences are based on big integer arithmetic, so the range can't exceed the range of an eight-byte integer (-9223372036854775808 to 9223372036854775807). Some older platforms might not have compiler support for eight-byte integers. In this case, sequences use regular `INTEGER` arithmetic (range -2147483648 to +2147483647).

Unexpected results can occur if you use a `cache` setting greater than `1` for a sequence object to be used concurrently by multiple sessions. Each session allocates and caches successive sequence values during one access to the sequence object and increases the sequence object’s last value accordingly. Then, the next `cache-1` that uses `NEXTVAL` in that session returns the preallocated values without touching the sequence object. So, any numbers allocated but not used in a session are lost when that session ends. "Holes" in the sequence result.

Furthermore, although multiple sessions are guaranteed to allocate distinct sequence values, the values might be generated out of sequence when all the sessions are considered. For example, with a `cache` setting of `10`, session A might reserve values 1..10 and return `NEXTVAL=1`. Then session B might reserve values 11..20 and return `NEXTVAL=11` before session A generates `NEXTVAL=2`. Thus, with a `cache` setting of `1`, it's safe to assume that `NEXTVAL` values are generated sequentially. With a `cache` setting greater than `1`, assume only that the `NEXTVAL` values are all distinct, not that they are generated sequentially. Also, the last value reflects the latest value reserved by any session, whether or not it was already returned by `NEXTVAL`.

## Examples

Create an ascending sequence called `serial`, starting at 101:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE serial START WITH 101;
```

Select the next number from this sequence:

```sql
SELECT serial.NEXTVAL FROM DUAL;
__OUTPUT__
 nextval
---------
     101
(1 row)
```

Create a sequence called `supplier_seq` with the `NOCACHE` option:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE supplier_seq
    MINVALUE 1
    START WITH 1
    INCREMENT BY 1
    NOCACHE;
```

Select the next number from this sequence:

```sql
SELECT supplier_seq.NEXTVAL FROM DUAL;
__OUTPUT__
 nextval
---------
       1
(1 row)
```
