title: "CREATE CAPTURE PRIVILEGES POLICY"
---

EDB Postgres Advanced Server includes extra syntax not offered by Oracle with the `CREATE CAPTURE PRIVILEGES POLICY` SQL command. 

## Name

`CREATE CAPTURE PRIVILEGES POLICY` &mdash; Create a new capture privilege policy.

## Synopsis

Use `CREATE CAPTURE PRIVILEGES POLICY` to define a new policy to capture privileges:

```sql
## Create a policy on database
CREATE CAPTURE PRIVILEGES POLICY <name> [ WHERE ( <expression> ) ];

## Create a policy on a ROLE/USER
CREATE CAPTURE PRIVILEGES POLICY <name> ON { ROLE | USER } <role_names> [ WHERE ( <expression> ) ];
```

## Description

The `CREATE CAPTURE PRIVILEGES POLICY` command allows a database superuser or any user with the system-defined `CAPTURE_ADMIN` privilege to create a policy in the database.

If the name of the policy is schema-qualified, the policy is created in the specified schema. If the `CREATE CAPTURE PRIVILEGES POLICY` command doesn't include a schema, the policy is created in the current schema. 

Use `DROP CAPTURE PRIVILEGES POLICY` to remove a capture policy.

## Parameters

`name`

 The name optionally schema-qualified of the capture privilege policy to create.

`expression`

 Boolean expression containing up to 4000 characters.  

`role_names`

 The roles whose privileges are to be analyzed.

## Examples

This command creates a capture privilege policy named `db1898_p1` on the database:

```sql
CREATE CAPTURE PRIVILEGES POLICY db1898_p1;
```

This command creates a capture privilege policy named `db1898_p2` on role `db1898_role1` and `db1898_user1`:

```sql
CREATE CAPTURE PRIVILEGES POLICY db1898_p2 ON ROLE db1898_role1,db1898_user1;
```
