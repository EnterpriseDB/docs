title: "CREATE CAPTURE PRIVILEGE"
---

EDB Postgres Advanced Server includes extra syntax not offered by Oracle with the `CREATE CAPTURE PRIVILEGES POLICY` SQL command. 

## Name

`CREATE CAPTURE PRIVILEGE POLICY` &mdash; Create a new capture privilege policy.

## Synopsis

Use `CREATE CAPTURE PRIVILEGE POLICY` to define a new policy to capture privileges:

```sql
## Create a policy on database
CREATE CAPTURE PRIVILEGES POLICY name [ WHERE ( expression ) ];

## Create a policy on a ROLE/USER
CREATE CAPTURE PRIVILEGES POLICY name ON { ROLE | USER } role_names [ WHERE ( expression ) ];
```

## Description

The `CREATE CAPTURE PRIVILEGES POLICY` command allows a database superuser or any user with the system-defined `CAPTURE_ADMIN` privilege to create a policy in the database.

If the name of the policy is schema-qualified, the policy is created in the specified schema. If the `CREATE CAPTURE PRIVILEGES POLICY` command doesn't include a schema, the policy is created in the current schema. 

Use `DROP CAPTURE PRIVILEGES POLICY` to remove a capture policy.

## Parameters

`name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the capture policy to create.



-----------------------------------


## Examples

This command creates a queue named `work_order` that's associated with a queue table named `work_order_table`:

```sql
CREATE QUEUE work_order QUEUE TABLE work_order_table (RETRIES 5, RETRYDELAY 2);
```

The server allows 5 attempts to remove a message from the queue and enforces a retry delay of 2 seconds between attempts.
