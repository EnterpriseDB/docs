## Description

`CREATE TRIGGER` defines a new trigger. `CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER` either creates a trigger or replaces an existing definition.

If you're using the `CREATE TRIGGER` keywords to create a new trigger, the name of the new trigger can't match any existing trigger defined on the same table. Triggers are created in the same schema as the table where the triggering event is defined.

If you're updating the definition of an existing trigger, use the `CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER` keywords.

When you use syntax that's compatible with Oracle to create a trigger, the trigger runs as a `SECURITY DEFINER` function.

## Parameters

`name`

 The name of the trigger to create.

`BEFORE | AFTER`

 Determines whether the trigger is fired before or after the triggering event.

`INSTEAD OF`

 Modifies an updatable view. The trigger executes to update the underlying tables appropriately. The `INSTEAD OF` trigger executes for each row of the view that's updated or modified.

`INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE | TRUNCATE`

 Defines the triggering event.

`table`

 The name of the table or view on which the triggering event occurs.

`condition`

 A Boolean expression that determines if the trigger executes. If `condition` evaluates to `TRUE`, the trigger fires.

-   If the simple trigger definition includes the `FOR EACH ROW` keywords, the `WHEN` clause can refer to columns of the old or new row values by writing `OLD.column_name` or `NEW.column_name`. `INSERT` triggers can't refer to `OLD`, and `DELETE` triggers can't refer to `NEW`.

-   If the compound trigger definition includes a statement-level trigger having a `WHEN` clause, then the trigger executes without evaluating the expression in the `WHEN` clause. Similarly, if a compound trigger definition includes a row-level trigger having a `WHEN` clause, then the trigger executes if the expression evaluates to `TRUE`.

-   If the trigger includes the `INSTEAD OF` keywords, it can't include a `WHEN` clause. A `WHEN` clause can't contain subqueries.

`REFERENCING { OLD AS old | NEW AS new } ...`

 `REFERENCING` clause to reference old rows and new rows. This clause is restricted in that you can replace `old` only with an identifier named `old` or any equivalent that's saved in all lowercase. Examples include `REFERENCING OLD AS old`, `REFERENCING OLD AS OLD`, and `REFERENCING OLD AS "old"`. Also, you can replace `new` only with an identifier named `new` or any equivalent that's saved in all lowercase. Examples include `REFERENCING NEW AS new`, `REFERENCING NEW AS NEW`, and `REFERENCING NEW AS "new"`.

 You can specify one or both phrases `OLD AS old` and `NEW AS new` in the `REFERENCING` clause, such as `REFERENCING NEW AS New OLD AS Old`.

 This clause isn't compatible with Oracle databases in that you can't use identifiers other than `old` or `new`.

`FOR EACH ROW`

 Determines whether to fire the trigger once for every row affected by the triggering event or just once per SQL statement. If you specify this parameter, the trigger is fired once for every affected row (row-level trigger). Otherwise the trigger is a statement-level trigger.

`PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION`

 `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` is the directive that sets the trigger as an autonomous transaction.

`declaration`

 A variable, type, `REF CURSOR`, or subprogram declaration. If you include subprogram declarations, declare them after all other variable, type, and `REF CURSOR` declarations.

`statement`

 An SPL program statement. A `DECLARE - BEGIN - END` block is considered an SPL statement. Thus, the trigger body can contain nested blocks.

`exception`

 An exception condition name, such as `NO_DATA_FOUND` and `OTHERS`.

## Examples

This example shows a statement-level trigger that fires after the triggering statement (insert, update, or delete on table `emp`) executes.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER user_audit_trig
    AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON emp
DECLARE
    v_action        VARCHAR2(24);
BEGIN
    IF INSERTING THEN
        v_action := ' added employee(s) on ';
    ELSIF UPDATING THEN
        v_action := ' updated employee(s) on ';
    ELSIF DELETING THEN
        v_action := ' deleted employee(s) on ';
    END IF;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('User ' || USER || v_action ||
        TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,'YYYY-MM-DD'));
END;
```

This example is a row-level trigger that fires before each row is either inserted, updated, or deleted on table `emp`.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER emp_sal_trig
    BEFORE DELETE OR INSERT OR UPDATE ON emp
    FOR EACH ROW
DECLARE
    sal_diff       NUMBER;
BEGIN
    IF INSERTING THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Inserting employee ' || :NEW.empno);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('..New salary: ' || :NEW.sal);
    END IF;
    IF UPDATING THEN
        sal_diff := :NEW.sal - :OLD.sal;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Updating employee ' || :OLD.empno);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('..Old salary: ' || :OLD.sal);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('..New salary: ' || :NEW.sal);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('..Raise     : ' || sal_diff);
    END IF;
    IF DELETING THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Deleting employee ' || :OLD.empno);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('..Old salary: ' || :OLD.sal);
    END IF;
END;
```

This example shows a compound trigger that records a change to the employee salary by defining a compound trigger `hr_trigger` on table `emp`.

Create a table named `emp`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE emp(EMPNO INT, ENAME TEXT, SAL INT, DEPTNO INT);
CREATE TABLE
```

Create a compound trigger named `hr_trigger`. The trigger uses each of the four timing-points to modify the salary with an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement. In the global declaration section, the initial salary is declared as `10,000`.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER hr_trigger
  FOR INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON emp
    COMPOUND TRIGGER
  -- Global declaration.
  var_sal NUMBER := 10000;

  BEFORE STATEMENT IS
  BEGIN
    var_sal := var_sal + 1000;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Before Statement: ' || var_sal);
  END BEFORE STATEMENT;

  BEFORE EACH ROW IS
  BEGIN
    var_sal := var_sal + 1000;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Before Each Row: ' || var_sal);
  END BEFORE EACH ROW;

  AFTER EACH ROW IS
  BEGIN
    var_sal := var_sal + 1000;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('After Each Row: ' || var_sal);
  END AFTER EACH ROW;

  AFTER STATEMENT IS
  BEGIN
    var_sal := var_sal + 1000;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('After Statement: ' || var_sal);
  END AFTER STATEMENT;

END hr_trigger;

Output: Trigger created.
```

`INSERT` the record into table `emp`.

```sql
INSERT INTO emp (EMPNO, ENAME, SAL, DEPTNO) VALUES(1111,'SMITH', 10000, 20);
```

The `INSERT` statement produces the following output:

```sql
__OUTPUT__
Before Statement: 11000
Before each row: 12000
After each row: 13000
After statement: 14000
INSERT 0 1
```

The `UPDATE` statement updates the employee salary record, setting the salary to `15000` for a specific employee number:

```sql
UPDATE emp SET SAL = 15000 where EMPNO = 1111;
```

The `UPDATE` statement produces the following output:

sql
__OUTPUT__
Before Statement: 11000
Before each row: 12000
After each row: 13000
After statement: 14000
UPDATE 1

SELECT * FROM emp;
 EMPNO | ENAME |  SAL  | DEPTNO
-------+-------+-------+--------
  1111 | SMITH | 15000 |     20
(1 row)
```

The `DELETE` statement deletes the employee salary record:

```sql
DELETE from emp where EMPNO = 1111;
```

The `DELETE` statement produces the following output:

```sql
Before Statement: 11000
Before each row: 12000
After each row: 13000
After statement: 14000
DELETE 1

SELECT * FROM emp;
__OUTPUT__
 EMPNO | ENAME | SAL | DEPTNO
-------+-------+-----+--------
(0 rows)
```

The `TRUNCATE` statement removes all the records from the `emp` table:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER hr_trigger
  FOR TRUNCATE ON emp
    COMPOUND TRIGGER
  -- Global declaration.
  var_sal NUMBER := 10000;
  BEFORE STATEMENT IS
  BEGIN
    var_sal := var_sal + 1000;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Before Statement: ' || var_sal);
  END BEFORE STATEMENT;

  AFTER STATEMENT IS
  BEGIN
    var_sal := var_sal + 1000;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('After Statement: ' || var_sal);
  END AFTER STATEMENT;

END hr_trigger;

Output: Trigger created.
```

The `TRUNCATE` statement produces the following output:

```sql
TRUNCATE emp;
__OUTPUT__
Before Statement: 11000
After statement: 12000
TRUNCATE TABLE
```

!!! Note
    You can use the `TRUNCATE` statement only at a `BEFORE STATEMENT` or `AFTER STATEMENT` timing point.

This example creates a compound trigger named `hr_trigger` on the `emp` table. It is a `WHEN` condition that checks and prints employee salary whenever an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statement affects the `emp` table. The database evaluates the `WHEN` condition for a row-level trigger, and the trigger executes once per row if the `WHEN` condition evaluates to `TRUE`. The statement-level trigger executes regardless of the `WHEN` condition.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER hr_trigger
  FOR INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON emp
  REFERENCING NEW AS new OLD AS old
  WHEN (old.sal > 5000 OR new.sal < 8000)
    COMPOUND TRIGGER

  BEFORE STATEMENT IS
  BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Before Statement');
  END BEFORE STATEMENT;

  BEFORE EACH ROW IS
  BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Before Each Row: ' || :OLD.sal ||' ' || :NEW.sal);
  END BEFORE EACH ROW;

  AFTER EACH ROW IS
  BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('After Each Row: ' || :OLD.sal ||' ' || :NEW.sal);
  END AFTER EACH ROW;

  AFTER STATEMENT IS
  BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('After Statement');
  END AFTER STATEMENT;

END hr_trigger;
```

Insert the record into table `emp`:

```sql
INSERT INTO emp(EMPNO, ENAME, SAL, DEPTNO) VALUES(1111, 'SMITH', 1600, 20);
```

The `INSERT` statement produces the following output:

```sql
__OUTPUT__
Before Statement
Before Each Row: 1600
After Each Row: 1600
After Statement
INSERT 0 1
```

The `UPDATE` statement updates the employee salary record, setting the salary to `7500`:

```sql
UPDATE emp SET SAL = 7500 where EMPNO = 1111;
```

The `UPDATE` statement produces the following output:

```sql
Before Statement
Before Each Row: 1600 7500
After Each Row: 1600 7500
After Statement
UPDATE 1

SELECT * from emp;
__OUTPUT__
 empno | ename | sal  | deptno
-------+-------+------+--------
  1111 | SMITH | 7500 |     20
(1 row)
```

The `DELETE` statement deletes the employee salary record:

```sql
DELETE from emp where EMPNO = 1111;
```

The `DELETE` statement produces the following output:

```sql
Before Statement
Before Each Row: 7500
After Each Row: 7500
After Statement
DELETE 1

SELECT * from emp;
__OUTPUT__
 empno | ename | sal | deptno
-------+-------+-----+--------
(0 rows)
```
