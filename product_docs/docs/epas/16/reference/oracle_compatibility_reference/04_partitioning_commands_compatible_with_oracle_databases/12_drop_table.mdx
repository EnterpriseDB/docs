<div id="drop_table" class="registered_link"></div>

Use the PostgreSQL `DROP TABLE` command to remove a partitioned table definition, its partitions and subpartitions, and the table contents. The syntax is:

```sql
DROP TABLE <table_name>
```

## Parameters

`table_name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the partitioned table.

## Description

The `DROP TABLE` command removes an entire table and the data that resides in that table. Deleting a table deletes any partitions or subpartitions of that table.

To use the `DROP TABLE` command, you must be the owner of the partitioning root, a member of a group that owns the table, the schema owner, or a database superuser.

## Example

To delete a table, connect to the controller node (the host of the partitioning root), and invoke the `DROP TABLE` command. For example, delete the `sales` table:

```sql
DROP TABLE sales;
```

The server confirms that the table was dropped:

```sql
edb=# drop table sales;
DROP TABLE
edb=#
```

For more information about the `DROP TABLE` command, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-droptable.html).
