A graphical installation is a quick and easy way to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on a Windows system. Use the wizard's screens to specify information about your system and system usage. After you complete the screens, the installer performs an installation based on the selections made during the setup process.

1. Assume administrator privileges, and double-click the `edb-as<xx>-server-xx.x.x-x-windows-x64` executable file, where `<xx>` is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version number.

    !!! Note
        To install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on some versions of Windows, you might need to right-click the file and select **Run as Administrator** from the context menu to invoke the installer with administrator privileges.

    ![The EDB Postgres Advanced Server installer Welcome window](../../../images/advanced_server_installer_welcome.png)

1. Select **Next**. The EnterpriseDB license agreement opens.

    ![The EnterpriseDB License Agreement](../../../images/enterprisedb_license_agreement.png)

1. Carefully review the license agreement before selecting the appropriate option. Select **Next**. 

    The Installation Directory window opens.

    ![The Installation Directory window](../../../images/installation_directory.png)

    By default, the EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation directory is:

    ```text
    C:\Program Files\edb\as<xx>
    ```

    Where `<xx>` is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version number.

1.  Accept the default installation location and select **Next**. Alternatively, select the file browser icon to open the Browse For Folder dialog box to choose a different installation directory.

    !!! Note
        Don't store the `data` directory of a production database on an NFS file system.

    The Select Components window opens, which contains a list of optional components that you can install with the EDB Postgres Advanced Server setup wizard. You can omit a component from the EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation by clearing the check box next to its name.
    
    ![The Select Components window](../../../images/select_components.png)

    The setup wizard can install the following components while installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server:

    -  Select **EDB Postgres Advanced Server** to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

    -  Select **StackBuilder Plus** to install that utility. The StackBuilder Plus utility is a graphical tool that can update installed products or download and add supporting modules (and the resulting dependencies) after your EDB Postgres Advanced Server setup and installation completes. See [Using StackBuilder Plus](using_stackbuilder_plus/) for more information.

    - The **Command Line Tools** option installs command line tools and supporting client libraries including these and others:

        -   libpq
        -   psql
        -   EDB\*Loader
        -   ecpgPlus
        -   pg_basebackup, pg_dump, and pg_restore 
        -   pg_bench

    !!! Note
        The command line tools are required if you're installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server or pgAdmin 4.

1. After selecting the components you want to install, select **Next**. The Additional Directories window opens.

    ![The Additional Directories window](../../../images/additional_directories.png)

    By default, the EDB Postgres Advanced Server data files are saved to:

  ```text
  C:\Program Files\edb<xx>\data
  ```
  Where `<xx>` is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version number.

  The default location of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server `Write-Ahead Log (WAL) Directory` is:

  ```text
  C:\Program Files\edb\as<xx>\data\pg_wal
  ```
    
  EDB Postgres Advanced Server uses write-ahead logs to promote transaction safety and speed transaction processing. When you make a change to a table, the change is stored in shared memory, and a record of the change is written to the write-ahead log. When you perform a COMMIT, EDB Postgres Advanced Server writes contents of the write-ahead log to disk.

1. Accept the default file locations, or use the file browser to select a different location. Select **Next**. 

    The EDB Postgres Advanced Server Dialect window opens. The server dialect specifies the compatibility features supported by EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

    ![The EDB Postgres Advanced Server Dialect window](../../../images/advanced_server_dialect.png)

1. From the list, select a server dialect. 

    By default, EDB Postgres Advanced Server installs in Compatible with Oracle mode. You can choose between Compatible with Oracle and Compatible with PostgreSQL installation modes.

    If you select **Compatible with Oracle**, the installation includes the following features:

    -   Data dictionary views that are compatible with Oracle databases.
    -   Oracle data type conversions.
    -   Date values displayed in a format compatible with Oracle syntax.
    -   Support for Oracle-styled concatenation rules. (If you concatenate a string value with a `NULL` value, the returned value is the value of the string.)
    -   Schemas (`dbo` and `sys`) compatible with Oracle databases added to the `SEARCH_PATH`.
    -   Support for the following Oracle built-in packages.

    This isn't a comprehensive list of the compatibility features for Oracle included when EDB Postgres Advanced Server is installed in Compatible with Oracle mode. For more information, see the [Database compatibility for Oracle developers built-in package](../../../reference/oracle_compatibility_reference/epas_compat_bip_guide/).

    If you choose to install in Compatible with Oracle mode, the EDB Postgres Advanced Server superuser name is enterprisedb.

    If you select **Compatible with PostgreSQL**, EDB Postgres Advanced Server exhibits compatibility with PostgreSQL version 15. If you choose to install in Compatible with PostgreSQL mode, the default EDB Postgres Advanced Server superuser name is postgres. For detailed information about PostgreSQL functionality, see the [PostgreSQL website](http://www.postgresql.org).

1. After specifying a configuration mode, select **Next**. The Password window opens.

    ![The Password window](../../../images/password_window.png)

    EDB Postgres Advanced Server uses the password specified on the Password window for the database superuser. The specified password must confirm to any security policies on the EDB Postgres Advanced Server host.

1. After you enter a password in the **Password** field and confirm the password in the **Retype Password** field, select **Next**. The Additional Configuration window opens.

    ![The Additional Configuration window](../../../images/additional_configuration.png)

1. Use the fields on the Additional Configuration window to specify installation details:

    -   Use the **Port** field to specify the port number for EDB Postgres Advanced Server to listen to for connection requests from client applications. The default is `5444`.
    -   If the **Locale** field is set to **[Default locale]**, EDB Postgres Advanced Server uses the system locale as the working locale. From the list, select an alternative locale for EDB Postgres Advanced Server.
    -   By default, the setup wizard installs corresponding sample data for the server dialect specified by the compatibility mode (Oracle or PostgreSQL). If you don't want to install sample data, clear the check box next to **Install sample tables and procedures**.

1. After verifying the information on the Additional Configuration window, select **Next**. The Dynatune Dynamic Tuning: Server Utilization window opens.

    ![The Dynatune Dynamic Tuning: Server Utilization window](../../../images/dynatune_dynamic_tuning_server_utilization.png)

    The setup wizard helps with performance tuning by way of the Dynatune Dynamic Tuning feature. Dynatune functionality allows EDB Postgres Advanced Server to make optimal use of the system resources available on the host machine on which it's installed.

1. Use the options on the Server Utilization window to set the initial value of the `edb_dynatune` configuration parameter. The `edb_dynatune` configuration parameter determines how EDB Postgres Advanced Server allocates system resources.

    -   Select **Development** to set the value of `edb_dynatune` to `33`. A low value dedicates the least amount of the host machine’s resources to the database server. This seletion is a good choice for a development machine.
    -   Select **General Purpose** to set the value of `edb_dynatune` to `66`. A mid-range value dedicates a moderate amount of system resources to the database server. This setting is good for an application server with a fixed number of applications running on the same host as EDB Postgres Advanced Server.
    -   Select **Dedicated** to set the value of `edb_dynatune` to `100`. A high value dedicates most of the system resources to the database server. This setting is a good choice for a dedicated server host.

    (After the installation is complete, you can adjust the value of `edb_dynatune` by editing the `postgresql.conf` file, located in the `data` directory of your EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation. After editing the `postgresql.conf` file, you must restart the server for your changes to take effect.)

    Select the appropriate setting for your system, and select **Next**. The Dynatune Dynamic Tuning: Workload Profile window opens.

    ![The Dynatune Dynamic Tuning: Workload Profile window](../../../images/dynatune_dynamic_tuning_workload_profile.png)

1. Use the options on the Workload Profile window to specify the initial value of the `edb_dynatune_profile` configuration parameter. The `edb_dynatune_profile` parameter controls performance-tuning aspects based on the type of work that the server performs.

    -   Select **Transaction Processing (OLTP systems)** to specify an `edb_dynatune_profile` value of `oltp`. Recommended when EDB Postgres Advanced Server is supporting heavy online transaction processing.
    -   Select **General Purpose (OLTP and reporting workloads)** to specify an `edb_dynatune_profile` value of `mixed`. Recommended for servers that provide a mix of transaction processing and data reporting.
    -   Select **Reporting (Complex queries or OLAP workloads)** to specify an `edb_dynatune_profile` value of `reporting`. Recommended for database servers used for heavy data reporting.

    After the installation is complete, you can adjust the value of `edb_dynatune_profile` by editing the `postgresql.conf` file, located in the `data` directory of your EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation. After editing the `postgresql.conf` file, you must restart the server for your changes to take effect.

    For more information about edb_dynatune and other performance-related topics, see the [Dynatune](../../../managing_performance/using_dynatune).

1.  Select **Next**.

    By default, EDB Postgres Advanced Server is configured to start the service when the system boots. The Pre Installation Summary opens.

    ![The Pre Installation Summary](../../../images/pre_installation_summary.png)

    The Pre Installation Summary provides an overview of the options specified during the setup process. 
    
1. Review the options before selecting **Next**. (Use **Back** to navigate back through the screens and update any options.)

    The Ready to Install window confirms that the installer has the information it needs about your configuration preferences to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server. 

1. Select **Next**.

    ![The Ready to Install window](../../../images/ready_to_install.png)

    ![Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](../../../images/installing_advanced_server.png)

    As each supporting module is unpacked and installed, the module’s installation is confirmed with a progress bar.

    Before the setup wizard completes the EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation, it prompts: `Launch StackBuilder Plus at exit?`

    ![The Setup wizard offers to Launch StackBuilder Plus at exit](../../../images/setup_wizard.png)

    EDB Postgres StackBuilder Plus is included with the installation of EDB Postgres Advanced Server and its core supporting components. StackBuilder Plus is a graphical tool that can update installed products or download and add supporting modules and the resulting dependencies after your EDB Postgres Advanced Server setup and installation completes. See [Using StackBuilder Plus](using_stackbuilder_plus/) for more information.

1. To complete the EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation, clear the **StackBuilder Plus** check box and select **Finish**. Alternatively, accept the default and proceed to StackBuilder Plus.
