title: "Excluding/Including the packages"
---

Different Linux distributions handle recommended or weak dependencies uniquely. This provides instructions on how to include or exclude these dependencies during package installation.

Adjusting these settings allows for more control over package installations, which can be particularly useful for creating minimal environments or reducing unnecessary package bloat.

## RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux

**Exclude Weak Dependencies Temporarily:**

To prevent DNF from installing weak dependencies during a single operation:

```bash
dnf --setopt=install_weak_deps=False install <package-name>
```

**Exclude Weak Dependencies Permanently:**

To disable the installation of weak dependencies system-wide:

1. Open the DNF configuration file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/dnf/dnf.conf
   ```

2. Add the following line:

   ```ini
   install_weak_deps=False
   ```

This setting ensures that weak dependencies are not installed by default.


## SLES

**Exclude Recommended Packages Temporarily:**

To install only the required packages without recommended ones:

```bash
zypper install --no-recommends <package-name>
```

**Include Recommended Packages Explicitly:**

To ensure both required and recommended packages are installed:

```bash
zypper install --recommends <package-name>
```

**Configure Default Behavior:**

To change the default behavior of Zypper regarding recommended packages:

1. Edit the Zypper configuration file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/zypp/zypp.conf
   ```

2. Set the following option:

   ```ini
   solver.onlyRequires = true
   ```

This configuration ensures that only required packages are installed by default.

## Debian/Ubuntu

**Exclude Recommended Packages Temporarily:**

To install a package without its recommended dependencies:

```bash
apt-get install --no-install-recommends <package-name>
```

**Set Default Behavior:**

To prevent APT from installing recommended packages by default:

1. Create a new configuration file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf.d/99norecommends
   ```

2. Add the following lines:

   ```ini
   APT::Install-Recommends "false";
   APT::Install-Suggests "false";
   ```

This configuration disables the automatic installation of recommended and suggested packages.
