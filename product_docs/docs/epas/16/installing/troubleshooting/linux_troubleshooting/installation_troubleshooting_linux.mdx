### Difficulty displaying Java-based applications

If you have difficulty displaying Java-based server features (controls or text not displaying correctly or blank windows), upgrading to the latest `libxcb-xlib` libraries corrects the problem on most distributions. See the [Java bug database](http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6532373) for other possible workarounds.

### The installation fails to complete due to existing data directory contents

If an installation fails to complete due to existing content in the data directory, the server writes an error message to the server logs:

`A data directory is neither empty, or a recognisable data directory.`

If you encounter a similar message, confirm that the data directory is empty. The presence of files, including the system-generated `lost+found` folder, prevents the installation from completing. Either remove the files from the data directory, or specify a different location for the data directory before invoking the installer again to complete the installation.

### Difficulty installing the EPEL release package

If you have difficulty installing the EPEL release package, you can use the following command to install the `epel-release` package on RHEL/CentOS 7.x and RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8.x:

```text
yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
```

You might need to enable the `[extras]` repository definition in the `CentOS-Base.repo` file, located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`. If yum can't access a repository that contains `epel-release`, an error message appears:

```text
No package epel available.
Error: Nothing to do
```

If you receive this error, you can download the EPEL rpm package and install it manually. To manually install EPEL, download the rpm package, assume superuser privileges, navigate into the directory that contains the package, and use this command:

```text
yum -y install epel-release

dnf -y install epel-release
```
