<div id="%notfound" class="registered_link"></div>

The `%NOTFOUND` attribute is the logical opposite of `%FOUND`.

```text
<cursor_name>%NOTFOUND
```

`cursor_name` is the name of the cursor for which a `BOOLEAN` data type of `FALSE` is returned if a row is retrieved from the result set of the cursor after a `FETCH`.

After the last row of the result set is fetched, the next `FETCH` results in `%NOTFOUND` returning `TRUE`. `TRUE` is also returned after the first `FETCH` if the result set has no rows to begin with.

Referencing `%NOTFOUND` on a cursor before it's opened or after it's closed results in an `INVALID_CURSOR` exception.

`%NOTFOUND` returns `null` if it's referenced when the cursor is open but before the first `FETCH`.

This example uses `%NOTFOUND`:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    v_emp_rec       emp%ROWTYPE;
    CURSOR emp_cur_1 IS SELECT * FROM emp;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_1;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('EMPNO    ENAME');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('-----    -------');
    LOOP
        FETCH emp_cur_1 INTO v_emp_rec;
        EXIT WHEN emp_cur_1%NOTFOUND;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(v_emp_rec.empno || '     ' || v_emp_rec.ename);
    END LOOP;
    CLOSE emp_cur_1;
END;
```

The following is the output from this example:

```sql
EXEC cursor_example;
__OUTPUT__
EMPNO    ENAME
-----    ------
7369     SMITH
7499     ALLEN
7521     WARD
7566     JONES
7654     MARTIN
7698     BLAKE
7782     CLARK
7788     SCOTT
7839     KING
7844     TURNER
7876     ADAMS
7900     JAMES
7902     FORD
7934     MILLER
```
