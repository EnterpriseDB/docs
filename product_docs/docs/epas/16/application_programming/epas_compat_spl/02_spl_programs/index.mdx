<div id="spl_programs" class="registered_link"></div>

SPL is a procedural, block-structured language. You can create four different types of programs using SPL: *procedures*, *functions*, *triggers*, and *packages*.

In addition, you can use SPL to create subprograms. A *subprogram* refers to a *subprocedure* or a *subfunction*. These are nearly identical in appearance to procedures and functions. They differ in that procedures and functions are *standalone programs*. They are stored individually in the database, and you can invoke them from other SPL programs or from PSQL. You can invoke subprograms only from the standalone program where they were created.
