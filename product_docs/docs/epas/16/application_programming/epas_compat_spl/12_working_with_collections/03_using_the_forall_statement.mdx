You can use collections to process DML commands more efficiently by passing all the values to be used for repetitive execution of a `DELETE`, `INSERT`, or `UPDATE` command in one pass to the database server. The alternative is to reiteratively invoke the DML command with new values. Specify the DML command to process this way with the `FORALL` statement. In addition, provide one or more collections in the DML command where you want to subsitute different values each time the command is executed.

## Syntax 

```sql
FORALL <index> IN <lower_bound> .. <upper_bound>
  { <insert_stmt> | <update_stmt> | <delete_stmt> };
```

`index` is the position in the collection given in the `insert_stmt`, `update_stmt`, or `delete_stmt` DML command that iterates from the integer value given as `lower_bound` up to and including `upper_bound.`

## How it works

If an exception occurs during any iteration of the `FORALL` statement, all updates that occurred since the start of the execution of the `FORALL` statement are rolled back. 

!!! Note 
    This behavior isn't compatible with Oracle databases. Oracle allows explicit use of the `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` commands to control whether to commit or roll back updates that occurred prior to the exception.

The `FORALL` statement creates a loop. Each iteration of the loop increments the `index` variable. You typically use the `index` in the loop to select a member of a collection. Control the number of iterations with the `lower_bound .. upper_bound` clause. The loop executes once for each integer between the `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` (inclusive), and the index increments by one for each iteration. 

For example:

`FORALL i IN 2 .. 5`

This expression creates a loop that executes four times. In the first iteration, `index (i)` is set to the value `2`. In the second iteration, the index is set to the value `3`, and so on. The loop executes for the value `5` and then terminates.

## Using FORALL with CREATE

This example creates a table `emp_copy` that's an empty copy of the `emp` table. The example declares a type `emp_tbl` that's an array. Each element in the array is of composite type, composed of the column definitions used to create the table `emp`. The example also creates an index on the `emp_tbl` type.

`t_emp` is an associative array of type `emp_tbl`. The `SELECT` statement uses the `BULK COLLECT INTO` command to populate the `t_emp` array. After the `t_emp` array is populated, the `FORALL` statement iterates through the values `(i)` in the `t_emp` array index and inserts a row for each record into `emp_copy`.

```sql
CREATE TABLE emp_copy(LIKE emp);

DECLARE

    TYPE emp_tbl IS TABLE OF emp%ROWTYPE INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;

    t_emp emp_tbl;

BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM emp BULK COLLECT INTO t_emp;

    FORALL i IN t_emp.FIRST .. t_emp.LAST
     INSERT INTO emp_copy VALUES t_emp(i);

END;
```

## Using FORALL with UPDATE

This example uses a `FORALL` statement to update the salary of three employees:

```sql
DECLARE
    TYPE empno_tbl  IS TABLE OF emp.empno%TYPE INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;
    TYPE sal_tbl    IS TABLE OF emp.ename%TYPE INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;
    t_empno         EMPNO_TBL;
    t_sal           SAL_TBL;
BEGIN
    t_empno(1)  := 9001;
    t_sal(1)    := 3350.00;
    t_empno(2)  := 9002;
    t_sal(2)    := 2000.00;
    t_empno(3)  := 9003;
    t_sal(3)    := 4100.00;
    FORALL i IN t_empno.FIRST..t_empno.LAST
        UPDATE emp SET sal = t_sal(i) WHERE empno = t_empno(i);
END;

SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno > 9000;
__OUTPUT__
 empno | ename  |   job   | mgr | hiredate |   sal   | comm | deptno
-------+--------+---------+-----+----------+---------+------+--------
  9001 | JONES  | ANALYST |     |          | 3350.00 |      |     40
  9002 | LARSEN | CLERK   |     |          | 2000.00 |      |     40
  9003 | WILSON | MANAGER |     |          | 4100.00 |      |     40
(3 rows)
```

## Using FORALL with DELETE

This example deletes three employees in a `FORALL` statement:

```sql
DECLARE
    TYPE empno_tbl  IS TABLE OF emp.empno%TYPE INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;
    t_empno         EMPNO_TBL;
BEGIN
    t_empno(1)  := 9001;
    t_empno(2)  := 9002;
    t_empno(3)  := 9003;
    FORALL i IN t_empno.FIRST..t_empno.LAST
        DELETE FROM emp WHERE empno = t_empno(i);
END;

SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno > 9000;
__OUTPUT__
 empno | ename | job | mgr | hiredate | sal | comm | deptno
-------+-------+-----+-----+----------+-----+------+--------
(0 rows)
```
