<div id="object_type_specification_syntax" class="registered_link"></div>

The following is the syntax of the object type specification:

```sql
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] TYPE <name>
  [ AUTHID { DEFINER | CURRENT_USER } ]
  { IS | AS } OBJECT
( { <attribute> { <datatype> | <objtype> | <collecttype> } }
    [, ...]
  [ <method_spec> ] [, ...]
  [ <constructor> ] [, ...]
) [ [ NOT ] { FINAL | INSTANTIABLE } ] ...;
```

Where `method_spec` is the following:

```sql
[ [ NOT ] { FINAL | INSTANTIABLE } ] ...
[ OVERRIDING ]
  <subprogram_spec>
```

Where `subprogram_spec` is the following:

```sql
{ MEMBER | STATIC }
{ PROCEDURE <proc_name>
    [ ( [  SELF [ IN | IN OUT ] <name> ]
        [, <parm1> [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] <datatype1>
                   [ DEFAULT <value1> ] ]
        [, <parm2> [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] <datatype2>
                   [ DEFAULT <value2> ]
        ] ...)
    ]
|
  FUNCTION <func_name>
    [ ( [  SELF [ IN | IN OUT ] <name> ]
        [, <parm1> [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] <datatype1>
                   [ DEFAULT <value1> ] ]
        [, <parm2> [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] <datatype2>
                   [ DEFAULT <value2> ]
        ] ...)
    ]
  RETURN <return_type>
}
```

Where `constructor` is the following:

```sql
CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION <func_name>
  [ ( [ <parm1> [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] <datatype1>
                 [ DEFAULT <value1> ] ]
      [, <parm2> [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] <datatype2>
                 [ DEFAULT <value2> ]
      ] ...)
  ]
RETURN <return_type>;
```

!!! Note
    -   You can't use the `OR REPLACE` option to add, delete, or modify the attributes of an existing object type. Use the `DROP TYPE` command to first delete the existing object type. You can use the `OR REPLACE` option to add, delete, or modify the methods in an existing object type.

    -   You can use the PostgreSQL form of the `ALTER TYPE ALTER ATTRIBUTE` command to change the data type of an attribute in an existing object type. However, the `ALTER TYPE` command can't add or delete attributes in the object type.

`name` is an identifier (optionally schema-qualified) assigned to the object type.

If you omit the `AUTHID` clause or specify `DEFINER`, the rights of the object type owner are used to determine access privileges to database objects. If you specify `CURRENT_USER`, the rights of the current user executing a method in the object determine access privileges.

## Syntax 

`attribute` is an identifier assigned to an attribute of the object type.

`datatype` is a base data type.

`objtype` is a previously defined object type.

`collecttype` is a previously defined collection type.

Following the closing parenthesis of the `CREATE TYPE` definition, `[ NOT ] FINAL` specifies whether a subtype can be derived from this object type. `FINAL`, which is the default, means that no subtypes can be derived from this object type. Specify `NOT FINAL` if you want to allow subtypes to be defined under this object type.

!!! Note
    Even though the specification of `NOT FINAL` is accepted in the `CREATE TYPE` command, SPL doesn't currently support creating subtypes.

Following the closing parenthesis of the `CREATE TYPE` definition, `[ NOT ] INSTANTIABLE` specifies whether an object instance of this object type can be created. `INSTANTIABLE`, which is the default, means that an instance of this object type can be created. Specify `NOT INSTANTIABLE` if this object type is to be used only as a parent “template” from which other specialized subtypes are defined. If `NOT INSTANTIABLE` is specified, then you must specify `NOT FINAL` as well. If any method in the object type contains the `NOT INSTANTIABLE` qualifier, then the object type must be defined with `NOT INSTANTIABLE` and `NOT FINAL`.

!!! Note
    Even though specifying `NOT INSTANTIABLE` is accepted in the `CREATE TYPE` command, SPL doesn't currently support creating subtypes.

## method_spec

`method_spec` denotes the specification of a member method or static method.

Before defining a method, use `[ NOT ] FINAL` to specify whether the method can be overridden in a subtype. `NOT FINAL` is the default, meaning the method can be overridden in a subtype.

Before defining a method, specify `OVERRIDING` if the method overrides an identically named method in a supertype. The overriding method must have the same number of identically named method parameters with the same data types and parameter modes, in the same order, and with the same return type (if the method is a function) as defined in the supertype.

Before defining a method, use `[ NOT ] INSTANTIABLE` to specify whether the object type definition provides an implementation for the method. If you specify `INSTANTIABLE`, then the `CREATE TYPE BODY` command for the object type must specify the implementation of the method. If you specify `NOT INSTANTIABLE`, then the `CREATE TYPE BODY` command for the object type must not contain the implementation of the method. In this latter case, it is assumed a subtype contains the implementation of the method, overriding the method in this object type. If there are any `NOT INSTANTIABLE` methods in the object type, then the object type definition must specify `NOT INSTANTIABLE` and `NOT FINAL` following the closing parenthesis of the object type specification. The default is `INSTANTIABLE`.

## subprogram_spec 

`subprogram_spec` denotes the specification of a procedure or function and begins with the specification of either `MEMBER` or `STATIC`. A member subprogram must be invoked with respect to a particular object instance while a static subprogram isn't invoked with respect to any object instance.

`proc_name` is an identifier of a procedure. If you specify the `SELF` parameter, `name` is the object type name given in the `CREATE TYPE` command. If specified, `parm1, parm2, …` are the formal parameters of the procedure. `datatype1, datatype2, …` are the data types of `parm1, parm2, …` respectively. `IN`, `IN OUT`, and `OUT` are the possible parameter modes for each formal parameter. The default is `IN`. `value1, value2, …` are default values that you can specify for `IN` parameters.

## CONSTRUCTOR 

Include the `CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION` keyword and function definition to define a constructor function.

`func_name` is an identifier of a function. If specified, `parm1, parm2, …` are the formal parameters of the function. `datatype1, datatype2, …` are the data types of `parm1, parm2, …` respectively. `IN`, `IN OUT`, and `OUT` are the possible parameter modes for each formal parameter. The default is `IN`. `value1, value2, …` are default values that you can specify for `IN` parameters. `return_type` is the data type of the value the function returns.

Note the following about an object type specification:

-   There must be at least one attribute defined in the object type.

-   There can be zero, one, or more methods defined in the object type.

-   A static method can't be overridden. You can't specify `OVERRIDING` and `STATIC` together in `method_spec`.

-   A static method must be instantiable. You can't specify `NOT INSTANTIABLE` and `STATIC` together in `method_spec`.
