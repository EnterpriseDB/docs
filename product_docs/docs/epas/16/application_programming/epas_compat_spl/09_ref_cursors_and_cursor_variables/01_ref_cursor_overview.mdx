A *cursor variable* is a cursor that contains a pointer to a query result set. The result set is determined by executing the `OPEN FOR` statement using the cursor variable.

A cursor variable isn't tied to a single query like a static cursor is. You can open the same cursor variable a number of times with `OPEN FOR` statements containing different queries. Each time, a new result set is created from that query and made available by way of the cursor variable.

You can pass `REF CURSOR` types as parameters to or from stored procedures and functions. The return type of a function can also be a `REF CURSOR` type. This ability lets you modularize the operations on a cursor into separate programs by passing a cursor variable between programs.
