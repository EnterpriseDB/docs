The text string output of the `version()` function displays the name of the product, its version, and the host system on which it was installed.

For EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the `version()` output is in a format similar to the PostgreSQL community version. The first text word is *PostgreSQL* instead of *EnterpriseDB* as in EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 10 and earlier.

The general format of the `version()` output is:

```text
PostgreSQL $PG_VERSION_EXT (EnterpriseDB EDB Postgres Advanced Server $PG_VERSION) on $host
```

So for the current EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the version string appears as follows:

```sql
edb@45032=#select version();
__OUTPUT__
version
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
------------------------------------------------
PostgreSQL 14.0 (EnterpriseDB EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14.0.0) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc 
(GCC) 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-11), 64-bit
(1 row)
```

In contrast, for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 10, the version string was the following:

```sql
edb=# select version();
__OUTPUT__
                                                version
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------
EnterpriseDB 10.4.9 on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (GCC) 4.4.7 20120313 (Red Hat 
4.4.7-18), 64-bit
(1 row)
```
