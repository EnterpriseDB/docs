<div id="creating_a_password_function" class="registered_link"></div>

When specifying `PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION`, you can provide a customized function that specifies the security rules to apply when your users change their password. For example, you can specify rules that stipulate that the new password must be at least *n* characters long and can't contain a specific value.

The password function has the following signature:

```sql
<function_name> (<user_name> VARCHAR2,
                 <new_password> VARCHAR2,
                 <old_password> VARCHAR2) RETURN boolean
```

Where:

-   `user_name` is the name of the user.

-   `new_password` is the new password.

-   `old_password` is the user's previous password. If you reference this parameter in your function:

    -  When a database superuser changes their password, the third parameter is always `NULL`.
    -  When a user with the `CREATEROLE` attribute changes their password, the parameter passes the previous password if the statement includes the `REPLACE` clause. The `REPLACE` clause is optional syntax for a user with the `CREATEROLE` privilege.
    -  When a user that isn't a database superuser and doesn't have the `CREATEROLE` attribute changes their password, the third parameter contains the previous password for the role.

The function returns a Boolean value. If the function returns `true` and doesn't raise an exception, the password is accepted. If the function returns `false` or raises an exception, the password is rejected. If the function raises an exception, the specified error message is displayed to the user. If the function doesn't raise an exception but returns `false`, the following error message is displayed:

`ERROR: password verification for the specified password failed`

The function must be owned by a database superuser and reside in the `sys` schema.

## Example

This example creates a profile and a custom function. Then, the function is associated with the profile. 

This `CREATE PROFILE` command creates a profile named `acctg_pwd_profile`:

```sql
CREATE PROFILE acctg_pwd_profile;
```

The following commands create a schema-qualified function named `verify_password`:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sys.verify_password(user_name varchar2,
new_password varchar2, old_password varchar2)
RETURN boolean IMMUTABLE
IS
BEGIN
  IF (length(new_password) < 5)
  THEN
    raise_application_error(-20001, 'too short');
  END IF;

  IF substring(new_password FROM old_password) IS NOT NULL
  THEN
    raise_application_error(-20002, 'includes old password');
  END IF;

  RETURN true;
END;
```

The function first ensures that the password is at least five characters long and then compares the new password to the old password. If the new password contains fewer than five characters or contains the old password, the function raises an error.

The following statement sets the ownership of the `verify_password` function to the `enterprisedb` database superuser:

```sql
ALTER FUNCTION verify_password(varchar2, varchar2, varchar2) OWNER TO
enterprisedb;
```

Then, the `verify_password` function is associated with the profile:

```sql
ALTER PROFILE acctg_pwd_profile LIMIT PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION
verify_password;
```

The following statements confirm that the function is working by first creating a test user (`alice`), and then attempting to associate invalid and valid passwords with her role:

```sql
CREATE ROLE alice WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'temp_password' PROFILE
acctg_pwd_profile;
```

Then, when `alice` connects to the database and attempts to change her password, she must adhere to the rules established by the profile function. A non-superuser without `CREATEROLE` must include the `REPLACE` clause when changing a password:

```sql
edb=> ALTER ROLE alice PASSWORD 'hey';
ERROR:  missing REPLACE clause
```

The new password must be at least five characters long:

```sql
edb=> ALTER USER alice PASSWORD 'hey' REPLACE 'temp_password';
ERROR:  EDB-20001: too short
CONTEXT:  edb-spl function verify_password(character varying,character
varying,character varying) line 5 at procedure/function invocation statement
```

If the new password is acceptable, the command completes without error:

```sql
edb=> ALTER USER alice PASSWORD 'hello' REPLACE 'temp_password';
ALTER ROLE
```

If `alice` decides to change her password, the new password must not contain the old password:

```sql
edb=> ALTER USER alice PASSWORD 'helloworld' REPLACE 'hello';
ERROR:  EDB-20002: includes old password
CONTEXT:  edb-spl function verify_password(character varying,character
varying,character varying) line 10 at procedure/function invocation statement
```

To remove the verify function, set `password_verify_function` to `NULL`:

```sql
ALTER PROFILE acctg_pwd_profile LIMIT password_verify_function NULL;
```

Then, all password constraints are lifted:

```sql
edb=# ALTER ROLE alice PASSWORD 'hey';
ALTER ROLE
```
