<div id="backing_up_restoring_sql_protect" class="registered_link"></div>

Backing up a database that's configured with SQL/Protect and then restoring the backup file to a new database requires considerations in addition to those normally associated with backup and restore procedures. These added considerations are mainly due to the use of object identification numbers (OIDs) in the SQL/Protect tables.

!!! Note
    This information applies if your backup and restore procedures result in re-creating database objects in the new database with new OIDs, such as when using the `pg_dump` backup program.

    If you're backing up your EDB Postgres Advanced Server database server by using the operating system’s copy utility to create a binary image of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server data files (file system backup method), then this information doesn't apply.

## Object identification numbers in SQL/Protect tables

SQL/Protect uses two tables, `edb_sql_protect` and `edb_sql_protect_rel`, to store information on database objects such as databases, roles, and relations. References to these database objects in these tables are done using the objects’ OIDs, not their text names. The OID is a numeric data type used by EDB Postgres Advanced Server to uniquely identify each database object.

When a database object is created, EDB Postgres Advanced Server assigns an OID to the object, which is then used when a reference to the object is needed in the database catalogs. If you create the same database object in two databases, such as a table with the same `CREATE TABLE` statement, each table is assigned a different OID in each database.

In a backup and restore operation that results in re-creating the backed-up database objects, the restored objects end up with different OIDs in the new database from what they were assigned in the original database. As a result, the OIDs referencing databases, roles, and relations stored in the `edb_sql_protect` and `edb_sql_protect_rel` tables are no longer valid when these tables are dumped to a backup file and then restored to a new database.

Two functions, `export_sqlprotect` and `import_sqlprotect`, are used specifically for backing up and restoring SQL/Protect tables to ensure the OIDs in the SQL/Protect tables reference the correct database objects after the tables are restored.

## Backing up the database

Back up a database that was configured with SQL/Protect.

1.  Create a backup file using `pg_dump`.

  This example shows a plain-text backup file named `/tmp/edb.dmp` created from database `edb` using the `pg_dump` utility program:

```shell
$ cd /usr/edb/as14/bin
$ ./pg_dump -U enterprisedb -Fp -f /tmp/edb.dmp edb
Password:
$
```

2.  Connect to the database as a superuser, and export the SQL/Protect data using the `export_sqlprotect('sqlprotect_file')` function. `sqlprotect_file` is the fully qualified path to a file where the SQL/Protect data is saved.

  The `enterprisedb` operating system account (`postgres` if you installed EDB Postgres Advanced Server in PostgreSQL compatibility mode) must have read and write access to the directory specified in `sqlprotect_file`.

```sql
edb=# SELECT sqlprotect.export_sqlprotect('/tmp/sqlprotect.dmp');
__OUTPUT__
 export_sqlprotect
-------------------
(1 row)
```

The files `/tmp/edb.dmp` and `/tmp/sqlprotect.dmp` comprise your total database backup.

## Restoring from the backup files

1.  Restore the backup file to the new database.

  This example uses the `psql` utility program to restore the plain-text backup file `/tmp/edb.dmp` to a newly created database named `newdb`:

```sql
$ /usr/edb/as14/bin/psql -d newdb -U enterprisedb -f /tmp/edb.dmp
Password for user enterprisedb:
SET
SET
SET
SET
SET
COMMENT
CREATE SCHEMA
    .
    .
    .
```

2.  Connect to the new database as a superuser, and delete all rows from the `edb_sql_protect_rel` table.

  This deletion removes any existing rows in the `edb_sql_protect_rel` table that were backed up from the original database. These rows don't contain the correct OIDs relative to the database where the backup file was restored.
<!--Consider replacing -->
```sql
$ /usr/edb/as14/bin/psql -d newdb -U enterprisedb
Password for user enterprisedb:
psql.bin (14.0.0, server 14.0.0)
Type "help" for help.

newdb=# DELETE FROM sqlprotect.edb_sql_protect_rel;
DELETE 2
```

3.  Delete all rows from the `edb_sql_protect` table.

  This deletion removes any existing rows in the `edb_sql_protect` table that were backed up from the original database. These rows don't contain the correct OIDs relative to the database where the backup file was restored.

```sql
newdb=# DELETE FROM sqlprotect.edb_sql_protect;
DELETE 1
```

4.  Delete any of the database's statistics.

  This deletion removes any existing statistics for the database to which you're restoring the backup. The following query displays any existing statistics:

```sql
newdb=# SELECT * FROM sqlprotect.edb_sql_protect_stats;
__OUTPUT__
 username  | superusers | relations | commands | tautology | dml
-----------+------------+-----------+----------+-----------+-----
(0 rows)
```

  For each row that appears in the preceding query, use the `drop_stats` function, specifying the role name of the entry.

  For example, if a row appeared with `appuser` in the `username` column, issue the following command to remove it:

```sql
newdb=# SELECT sqlprotect.drop_stats('appuser');
__OUTPUT__
 drop_stats
------------
(1 row)
```

5.  Delete any of the database's offending queries.

  This deletion removes any existing queries for the database to which you're restoring the backup. This query displays any existing queries:

```sql
edb=# SELECT * FROM sqlprotect.edb_sql_protect_queries;
__OUTPUT__
 username  | ip_address | port | machine_name | date_time | query
-----------+------------+------+--------------+-----------+-------
(0 rows)
```

  For each row that appears in the preceding query, use the `drop_queries` function, specifying the role name of the entry. For example, if a row appeared with `appuser` in the `username` column, issue the following command to remove it:

```sql
edb=# SELECT sqlprotect.drop_queries('appuser');
__OUTPUT__
 drop_queries
--------------
(1 row)
```

6.  Make sure the role names that were protected by SQL/Protect in the original database are in the database server where the new database resides.

  If the original and new databases reside in the same database server, then you don't need to do anything if you didn't delete any of these roles from the database server.

7.  Run the function `import_sqlprotect('sqlprotect_file')`, where `sqlprotect_file` is the fully qualified path to the file you created in Step 2 of [Backing up the database](#backing-up-the-database).

```sql
newdb=# SELECT sqlprotect.import_sqlprotect('/tmp/sqlprotect.dmp');
__OUTPUT__
 import_sqlprotect
-------------------
(1 row)
```

  Tables `edb_sql_protect` and `edb_sql_protect_rel` are populated with entries containing the OIDs of the database objects as assigned in the new database. The statistics view `edb_sql_protect_stats` also displays the statistics imported from the original database.

  The SQL/Protect tables and statistics are properly restored for this database. Use the following queries on the EDB Postgres Advanced Server system catalogs to verify:

```sql
newdb=# SELECT datname, oid FROM pg_database;
__OUTPUT__
  datname  |  oid
-----------+-------
 template1 |     1
 template0 | 13909
 edb       | 13917
 newdb     | 16679
(4 rows)
```
```sql
newdb=# SELECT rolname, oid FROM pg_roles;
__OUTPUT__
   rolname    |  oid
--------------+-------
 enterprisedb |    10
 appuser      | 16671
 newuser      | 16678
(3 rows)
```
```sql
newdb=# SELECT relname, oid FROM pg_class WHERE relname IN
('dept','emp','appuser_tab');
__OUTPUT__
   relname   |  oid
-------------+-------
 appuser_tab | 16803
 dept        | 16809
 emp         | 16812
(3 rows)
```
```sql
newdb=# SELECT * FROM sqlprotect.edb_sql_protect;
__OUTPUT__
 dbid  | roleid | protect_relations | allow_utility_cmds | allow_tautology |
 allow_empty_dml
-------+--------+-------------------+--------------------+-----------------+--

 16679 |  16671 | t                 | t                  | f               | f
(1 row)
```
```sql
newdb=# SELECT * FROM sqlprotect.edb_sql_protect_rel;
__OUTPUT__
 dbid  | roleid | relid
-------+--------+-------
 16679 |  16671 | 16809
 16679 |  16671 | 16803

```
```sql
newdb=# SELECT * FROM sqlprotect.edb_sql_protect_stats;
__OUTPUT__

----------+------------+-----------+----------+-----------+-----
 appuser  |          0 |         5 |        2 |         1 |   0
(1 row)
```
```sql

 query        | SELECT * FROM appuser_tab_2 WHERE 'x' = 'x';
```

  Note the following about the columns in tables `edb_sql_protect` and `edb_sql_protect_rel`:

  -   **dbid.** Matches the value in the `oid` column from `pg_database` for `newdb`.
  -   **roleid.** Matches the value in the `oid` column from `pg_roles` for `appuser`.

  Also, in table `edb_sql_protect_rel`, the values in the `relid` column match the values in the `oid` column of `pg_class` for relations `dept` and `appuser_tab`.

8.  Verify that the SQL/Protect configuration parameters are set as desired in the `postgresql.conf` file for the database server running the new database. Restart the database server or reload the configuration file as appropriate.

You can now monitor the database using SQL/Protect.
