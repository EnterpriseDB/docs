The method you use to revert to a previous cluster varies with the options specified when invoking `pg_upgrade`:

-   If you specified the `--check` option when invoking `pg_upgrade`, an upgrade wasn't performed and no modifications were made to the old cluster. You can reuse the old cluster at any time.
-   If you included the `--link` option when invoking `pg_upgrade`, the data files are shared between the old and new cluster after the upgrade completes. If you started the server that's servicing the new cluster, the new server wrote to those shared files, and it's unsafe to use the old cluster.
-   If you ran `pg_upgrade` without the `--link` specification or haven't started the new server, the old cluster is unchanged except that the `.old` suffix was appended to the `$PGDATA/global/pg_control` and tablespace directories.
-   To reuse the old cluster, delete the tablespace directories created by the new cluster. Remove the `.old` suffix from `$PGDATA/global/pg_control` and the old cluster tablespace directory names. Restart the server that services the old cluster.
