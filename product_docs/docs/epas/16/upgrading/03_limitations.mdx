The `pg_upgrade` executable is distributed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server and is installed as part of the Database Server component. You don't need to further install or configure it. The `pg_upgrade` utility performs an in-place transfer of existing data between EDB Postgres Advanced Server and any later version.

Several factors determine if an in-place upgrade is practical:

-   The on-disk representation of user-defined tables must not change between the original version and the upgraded version.
-   The on-disk representation of data types must not change between the original version and the upgraded version.
-   To upgrade between major versions of EDB Postgres Advanced Server with `pg_upgrade`, both versions must share a common binary representation for each data type. Therefore, you can't use `pg_upgrade` to migrate from a 32-bit to a 64-bit Linux platform.

Before performing a version upgrade, `pg_upgrade` verifies that the old cluster and the new cluster are compatible.

If the upgrade involves a change in the on-disk representation of database objects or data, or if it involves a change in the binary representation of data types, `pg_upgrade` can't perform the upgrade. To upgrade, you have to `pg_dump` the old data and then import that data to the new cluster, as described below.

1.  Export all of your data using `pg_dump`. 
1.  Install the new release. 
1.  Run `initdb` to create a new cluster. 
1.  Import your old data.

Consider the following when upgrading EDB Postgres Advanced Server:

-   The `pg_upgrade` utility can't upgrade a partitioned table if a foreign key refers to the partitioned table.
-   If you perform an upgrade of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation, you must rebuild any hash-partitioned table on the upgraded server.
-   If you're using an ODBC, JDBC, OCI, or .NET driver to connect to your database applications and upgrading to a new major version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server, upgrade your driver to the latest version when upgrading EDB Postgres Advanced Server.
