!!! Note
    Review the [upgrade considerations](03_limitations) prior to performing an upgrade with the `pg_upgrade` utility.

While minor upgrades between versions are fairly simple and require only installing new executables, past major version upgrades were both expensive and time consuming. `pg_upgrade` eases migration between any version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server (version 9.0 or later) and any later release of EDB Postgres Advanced Server that's supported on the same platform.

Using `pg_upgrade` can reduce both the amount of time and the disk space required for many major-version upgrades.
