| Upstream merge | Merged with community PostgreSQL 16.9. This release includes a fix for [CVE-2025-4207](https://www.postgresql.org/support/security/CVE-2025-4207/). See the [PostgreSQL 16.9 Release Notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/16.9/) for more information.                                                                                |                                                                                                     |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Modified SUBSTRB() to accept clipped slices, aligning its behavior with Redwood by allowing incomplete character boundaries and improving compatibility.                                                                           | #45636                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed the `alteruser` utility to set the encoding correctly to avoid a possible server crash.                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                     |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed the behavior of `edb_dynatune` to ensure it functions as expected.                                                                                                                                                           | #45385                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed the definition of the `sys.*_scheduler_jobs` views in `dbms_scheduler` to populate previously missing column values, and bumped the extension version to reflect the change.                                                 | #48375                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue in `dbms_job` where jobs with identical start times caused `dba_jobs` and `user_jobs` views to return incorrect results by updating the view definitions. Also, bumped the extension version to reflect the change. | #38664                                                                                              |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed computation of nullingrels in Redwood-style left joins, which previously caused errors such as `wrong varnullingrels (b) (expected (b 10)) for Var 3/2`.                                                                     | #42059                                                                                              |
