| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue where memory was allocated in an inappropriate context during parallel execution, leading to rare crashes when the system released data still in use by active workers; memory is now correctly scoped to a long-lived context. | #52519          |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed an issue with stack overflow in `edb_partition` due to circular references during partition creation.                                                                                                                                    |                 |
