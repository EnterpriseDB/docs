| Type           | Description                                                                                                                          |  Category              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  --------------------- |
| Upstream merge | Merged with community PostgreSQL 16 beta. See the [PostgreSQL 16 Release Notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/release-16.html) for more information.                           |                        |
| Feature        | Added the `edb_job_scheduler` extension, which provides a background process that does the job scheduling for the `DBMS_SCHEDULER` and `DBMS_JOB` packages. Before, these packages were dependent on pgAgent. With this extension, packages don't have that dependency. |                         |
| Feature        | Added capture privilege, which allows you to create the policy to capture the database object privileges and to find out used and unused privileges on database objects. This feature introduces three new system catalogs: `edb_capture_privileges_policy`, `edb_capture_privileges_run`, and `edb_capture_privileges_log`. |                       |
| Feature        | Transparent data encryption (TDE) now supports the AES key length 256 option to TDE. The default is still AES-128, but the AES-256 option is available for use cases where 256-bit is a regulatory requirement and for feature parity with SQL Server's TDE technology that uses AES-256. |                            |
| Feature        | Two new functions return timezone set values: `DBTIMEZONE` and `SESSIONTIMEZONE`. <br /><br />`DBTIMEZONE` returns the value of the database time zone. The return type is a time zone offset in the format `[+\|-]TZH:TZM` or a time zone region name. The return type depends on the user-specified database time zone value in the recent `CREATE DATABASE` or `ALTER DATABASE` statement. 
<br /><br />`SESSIONTIMEZONE` returns the time zone of the current session. The return type is a time zone offset in the format `[+\|-]TZH:TZM` or a time zone region name. The return type depends on the user-specified session time zone value in the recent `ALTER SESSION` or `SET` statement. |                         |
| Feature        | `MULTISET INTERSECT UNIQUE/DISTINCT` and `MULTISET EXCEPT UNIQUE/DISTINCT` are now implemented for collections. |                            |
| Feature        | The `EXPAND_SQL_TEXT` procedure of the `DBMS_UTILITY` package is now supported. It returns an expanded version of a given SQL query by replacing view references with its definition. |                          |
| Feature        | You can now use the `BULK COLLECT` clause with a `FETCH` statement. Instead of returning a single row at a time from the result set, the `FETCH BULK COLLECT` returns all rows at once from the result set into one or more specified collections (both scalar and composite types) unless restricted by the `LIMIT` clause. |                         |
| Feature        | The (`ORDERED, NULL`) upperrel operations are now performed remotely. Use dblink_oci to do it for the (`ORDERED, NULL`) upperrel, which is responsible for evaluating the queryâ€™s `ORDER BY` ordering. |                        |
| Feature        | Packages now support synonyms. While looking for a package oid, you can now also look for a matching synonym pointing to a package, if the package oid isn't found. |                                  |
| Feature        | The `TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ()` function now takes a single argument. The `TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ()` function converts CHAR data type to the `TIMESTAMP TO TIME ZONE`. The format is optional. The default format is `"DD-MON-YY HH12.MI.SS.FF6 AM TZH:TZM"`. |                            |
| Feature        | Added support for the redwood-compatible `NANVL` function. The `NANVL` function returns the first of its arguments that's a not-a-number (NaN) value. `NANVL` evaluates the first expression. If that expression evaluates to a NaN value, `NANVL` returns the second expression. If the first expression evaluates to a number value, `NANVL` returns the first expression. The `NANVL` function is useful only for floating-point numbers of type `BINARY_FLOAT` or `BINARY_DOUBLE`. |                         |
| Feature        | Added support for the redwood-equivalent `LNNVL()` function. `LNNVL` function provides a concise way to evaluate a condition when one or both operands of the condition can be null. |                            |
| Feature        | Added support for the redwood-compatible `DUMP` SQL function. The `DUMP` function returns a VARCHAR2 value that contains the datatype code, length in bytes, and internal representation of the expression. |                         |
| Feature        | Added redwood-compatible `NLS CHARSET` functions: <br /><br />
- `NLS_CHARSET_ID()` &mdash; Converts encoding name to encoding id. <br /><br />
- `NLS_CHARSET_NAME()` &mdash; Converts encoding id to encoding name. <br /><br />
- `NLS_CHARSET_DECL_LEN()` &mdash; Calculates length of NCHAR column. |                         |
| Feature        | To better support migrations, implemented missing `UTL_FILE` subprograms. The following subprograms were found to be in use in schemas assessed by Migration Portal: `utl_file.fgetattr`,
`utl_file.put_raw`, `utl_file.get_raw`, `utl_file.fgetpos`, `utl_file.fseek`, `utl_file.fopen_nchar`, and `utl_file.put_nchar` |                        |
| Feature        | To better support migrations, implemented missing `DBMS_SQL` subprograms. The following subprograms were found to be in use in schemas assessed by Migration Portal: `dbms_sql.variable_value`, 
`dbms_sql.define_array`, `dbms_sql.bind_array`, `dbms_sql.to_refcursor`, `dbms_sql.to_cursor_number`, `dbms_sql.describe_columns2`, `dbms_sql.column_value_long`, `dbms_sql.define_column_long`, `dbms_sql.define_column_rowid`, `dbms_sql.column_value_rowid`, `dbms_sql.describe _columns3`, `dbms_sql.return_result` |                     |
