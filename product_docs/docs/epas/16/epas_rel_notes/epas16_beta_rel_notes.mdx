| Type           | Description                                                                                                                          |  Category              |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|  --------------------- |
| Upstream merge | Merged with community PostgreSQL 16 beta. See the [PostgreSQL 16 Release Notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/16/release-16.html) for more information.                           |                        |
| Feature        | Added capture privilege, which allows you to create the policy to capture the database object privileges and to find out used and unused privileges on database objects. This feature supports the Oracle-compatible `DBMS_PRIVILEGE_CAPTURE` package and the SQL commands to define the capture privilege policy. See the [DBMS_PRIVILEGE_CAPTURE](../reference/oracle_compatibility_reference/epas_compat_bip_guide/03_built-in_packages/10_dbms_privilege_capture/) for more information. |                       |
| Feature        | Two new functions return timezone set values: `DBTIMEZONE` and `SESSIONTIMEZONE`. <br />`DBTIMEZONE` returns the value of the database time zone. See the [TIMEZONE functions](../reference/sql_reference/03_functions_and_operators/08_date_time_functions_and_operators/#timezone-functions) for more information. |                   |
| Feature        | Added support for the Oracle-compatible `NANVL` function. See the [NANVL function](../reference/sql_reference/03_functions_and_operators/10_conditional_expressions/#nanvl) for more information.|                         |
| Feature        | Added support for the Oracle-equivalent `LNNVL()` function. See the [LNNVL function](../reference/sql_reference/03_functions_and_operators/10_conditional_expressions/#lnnvl) for more information. |                            |
| Feature        | Added support for the Oracle-compatible `DUMP` SQL function. See the [DUMP function](../reference/sql_reference/03_functions_and_operators/dump_function/) for more information. |                         |
| Feature        | Added support for redwood-compatible `NLS CHARSET` functions: <br />- `NLS_CHARSET_ID()` <br />- `NLS_CHARSET_NAME()` <br />- `NLS_CHARSET_DECL_LEN()` <br />See the [NLS functions](../reference/sql_reference/03_functions_and_operators/04_string_functions_and_operators/) for more information.|                         |
| Feature        | Added support for `DBMS_SQL` subprograms to ease the migrations:<br />- `dbms_sql.variable_value()`<br />- `dbms_sql.define_array()`<br />- `dbms_sql.bind_array()`<br />- `dbms_sql.to_refcursor()`<br />- `dbms_sql.to_cursor_number()`<br />- `dbms_sql.describe_columns2()`<br />- `dbms_sql.column_value_long()`<br />- `dbms_sql.define_column_long()`<br />- `dbms_sql.define_column_rowid()`<br />- `dbms_sql.column_value_rowid()`<br />- `dbms_sql.describe _columns3()`<br />- `dbms_sql.return_result()`<br />- See the [DBMS_SQL package](../reference/oracle_compatibility_reference/epas_compat_bip_guide/03_built-in_packages/17_dbms_sql/) for more information. |                     |
| Feature        | Added `spl_check` extension to check and report errors for the EDB SPL language. See the [spl_check](https://deploy-preview-4781--edb-docs-staging.netlify.app/docs/pg_extensions/spl_check/) for more information. |
| Enhancement    | Added support for `UTL_FILE` subprograms to ease the migrations:<br />- `utl_file.fgetattr()`<br />- `utl_file.put_raw()`<br />-`utl_file.get_raw()`<br />- `utl_file.fgetpos()`<br />- `utl_file.fseek()`<br />- `utl_file.fopen_nchar()`<br />- `utl_file.put_nchar()`. |                             |
| Enhancement    | Transparent data encryption (TDE) now supports the AES key length 256 option to TDE. The default is still AES-128, but the AES-256 option is available for use cases where 256-bit is a regulatory requirement and for feature parity with SQL Server's TDE technology that uses AES-256. |                            |
| Enhancement    | Added the `edb_job_scheduler` extension, which provides a background process that does the job scheduling for the `DBMS_SCHEDULER` and `DBMS_JOB` packages. Before, these packages were dependent on pgAgent. With this extension, packages don't have that dependency. |                         |
| Enhancement    | The (`ORDERED, NULL`) upperrel operations are now performed remotely through OCI DBlink, which is responsible for evaluating the queryâ€™s `ORDER BY` ordering.|                        |
| Enhancement    | `MULTISET INTERSECT UNIQUE/DISTINCT` and `MULTISET EXCEPT UNIQUE/DISTINCT` are now implemented for SPL collection types. |                            |
| Enhancement    | You can now use the `BULK COLLECT` clause with a `FETCH` statement. Instead of returning a single row at a time from the result set, the `FETCH BULK COLLECT` returns all rows at once from the result set into one or more specified collections (both scalar and composite types) unless restricted by the `LIMIT` clause. |                         |
| Enhancement    | Added synonym support for packages. |                                  |
| Enhancement    | The `TO_TIMESTAMP_TZ()` function now takes a single argument that converts a string to `TIMESTAMPTZ` in the default format. |                            |
| Enhancement    | The `EXPAND_SQL_TEXT` procedure of the `DBMS_UTILITY` package is now supported. It returns an expanded version of a given SQL query by replacing view references with its definition. |                          |
| Deprecation    | `edb_partition_pruning` GUC parameter is now removed. |
