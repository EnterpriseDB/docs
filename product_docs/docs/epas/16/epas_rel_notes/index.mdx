## Support announcements

### Backup and Recovery Tool (BART) incompatibility

The EDB Backup and Recovery Tool (BART) isn't supported by EDB Postgres Advanced Server or PostgreSQL version 14 and later. We strongly recommend that you move to [Barman](/supported-open-source/barman/) or [PgBackRest](/supported-open-source/pgbackrest/) as your backup recovery tool. See [Moving to a New Backup Tool](/bart/latest/bart_migration/) in the BART documentation for more information.
