title: "NULL"

<div id="null" class="registered_link"></div>

The simplest statement is the `NULL` statement. This statement is an executable statement that does nothing.

```text
NULL;
```

The following is the simplest possible valid SPL program.

```text
BEGIN
    NULL;
END;
```

The `NULL` statement can act as a placeholder where an executable statement is required such as in a branch of an `IF-THEN-ELSE` statement.

For example:

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE divide_it (
    p_numerator     IN  NUMBER,
    p_denominator   IN  NUMBER,
    p_result        OUT NUMBER
)
IS
BEGIN
    IF p_denominator = 0 THEN
        NULL;
    ELSE
        p_result := p_numerator / p_denominator;
    END IF;
END;
```
