There are several attributes that can be used to determine the effect of a command. `SQL%FOUND` is a Boolean that returns `TRUE` if at least one row was affected by an `INSERT, UPDATE` or `DELETE` command or a `SELECT INTO` command retrieved one or more rows.

The following anonymous block inserts a row and then displays the fact that the row has been inserted.

```text
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO emp (empno,ename,job,sal,deptno) VALUES (
        9001, 'JONES', 'CLERK', 850.00, 40);
    IF SQL%FOUND THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Row has been inserted');
    END IF;
END;

Row has been inserted
```

`SQL%ROWCOUNT` provides the number of rows affected by an `INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE`, or `SELECT INTO` command. The `SQL%ROWCOUNT` value is returned as a `BIGINT` data type. The following example updates the row that was just inserted and displays `SQL%ROWCOUNT`.

```text
BEGIN
    UPDATE emp SET hiredate = '03-JUN-07' WHERE empno = 9001;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('# rows updated: ' || SQL%ROWCOUNT);
END;

# rows updated: 1
```

`SQL%NOTFOUND` is the opposite of `SQL%FOUND`. `SQL%NOTFOUND` returns `TRUE` if no rows were affected by an `INSERT, UPDATE` or `DELETE` command or a `SELECT INTO` command retrieved no rows.

```text
BEGIN
    UPDATE emp SET hiredate = '03-JUN-07' WHERE empno = 9000;
    IF SQL%NOTFOUND THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('No rows were updated');
    END IF;
END;

No rows were updated
```
