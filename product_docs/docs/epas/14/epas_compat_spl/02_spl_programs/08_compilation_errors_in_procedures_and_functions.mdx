When the Advanced Server parsers compile a procedure or function, they confirm that both the `CREATE` statement and the program body (that portion of the program that follows the `AS` keyword) conforms to the grammar rules for SPL and SQL constructs. By default, the server will terminate the compilation process if a parser detects an error. Note that the parsers detect syntax errors in expressions, but not semantic errors (i.e. an expression referencing a non-existent column, table, or function, or a value of incorrect type).

`spl.max_error_count` instructs the server to stop parsing if it encounters the specified number of errors in SPL code, or when it encounters an error in SQL code. The default value of `spl.max_error_count` is `10`; the maximum value is `1000`. Setting `spl.max_error_count` to a value of `1` instructs the server to stop parsing when it encounters the first error in either SPL or SQL code.

You can use the `SET` command to specify a value for `spl.max_error_count` for your current session. The syntax is:

```text
SET spl.max_error_count = <number_of_errors>
```

Where `number_of_errors` specifies the number of SPL errors that may occur before the server halts the compilation process. For example:

```
SET spl.max_error_count = 6
```

The example instructs the server to continue past the first five SPL errors it encounters. When the server encounters the sixth error it will stop validating, and print six detailed error messages, and one error summary.

To save time when developing new code, or when importing existing code from another source, you may want to set the `spl.max_error_count` configuration parameter to a relatively high number of errors.

Please note that if you instruct the server to continue parsing in spite of errors in the SPL code in a program body, and the parser encounters an error in a segment of SQL code, there may still be errors in any SPL or SQL code that follows the erroneous SQL code. For example, the following function results in two errors:

```text
CREATE FUNCTION computeBonus(baseSalary number) RETURN number AS
BEGIN

    bonus := baseSalary * 1.10;
    total := bonus + 100;

    RETURN bonus;
END;

ERROR:  "bonus" is not a known variable
LINE 4:     bonus := baseSalary * 1.10;
            ^
ERROR:  "total" is not a known variable
LINE 5:     total := bonus + 100;
            ^
ERROR:  compilation of SPL function/procedure "computebonus" failed due to 2 errors
```

The following example adds a `SELECT` statement to the previous example. The error in the `SELECT` statement masks the other errors that follow:

```text
CREATE FUNCTION computeBonus(employeeName number) RETURN number AS
BEGIN
    SELECT salary INTO baseSalary FROM emp
      WHERE ename = employeeName;

    bonus := baseSalary * 1.10;
    total := bonus + 100;

    RETURN bonus;

END;

ERROR:  "basesalary" is not a known variable
LINE 3:     SELECT salary INTO baseSalary FROM emp WHERE ename = emp...
```
