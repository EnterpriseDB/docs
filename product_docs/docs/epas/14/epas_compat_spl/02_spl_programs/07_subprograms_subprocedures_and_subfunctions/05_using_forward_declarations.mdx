<div id="using_forward_declarations" class="registered_link"></div>

As discussed so far, when a subprogram is to be invoked, it must have been declared somewhere in the hierarchy of blocks within the standalone program, but prior to where it is invoked. In other words, when scanning the SPL code from beginning to end, the subprogram declaration must be found before its invocation.

However, there is a method of constructing the SPL code so that the full declaration of the subprogram (that is, its optional declaration section, its mandatory executable section, and optional exception section) appears in the SPL code after the point in the code where it is invoked.

This is accomplished by inserting a *forward declaration* in the SPL code prior to its invocation. The forward declaration is the specification of a subprocedure or subfunction name, formal parameters, and return type if it is a subfunction.

The full subprogram specification consisting of the optional declaration section, the executable section, and the optional exception section must be specified in the same declaration section as the forward declaration, but may appear following other subprogram declarations that invoke this subprogram with the forward declaration.

Typical usage of a forward declaration is when two subprograms invoke each other as shown by the following:

```text
DECLARE
    FUNCTION add_one (
        p_add       IN NUMBER
    ) RETURN NUMBER;
    FUNCTION test_max (
        p_test      IN NUMBER)
    RETURN NUMBER
    IS
    BEGIN
        IF p_test < 5 THEN
            RETURN add_one(p_test);
        END IF;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT('Final value is ');
        RETURN p_test;
    END;
    FUNCTION add_one (
        p_add       IN NUMBER)
    RETURN NUMBER
    IS
    BEGIN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Increase by 1');
        RETURN test_max(p_add + 1);
    END;
BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(test_max(3));
END;
```

Subfunction `test_max` invokes subfunction `add_one`, which also invokes subfunction `test_max`, so a forward declaration is required for one of the subprograms, which is implemented for `add_one` at the beginning of the anonymous block declaration section.

The resulting output from the anonymous block is as follows:

```text
Increase by 1
Increase by 1
Final value is 5
```
