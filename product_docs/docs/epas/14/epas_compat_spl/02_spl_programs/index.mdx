SPL is a procedural, block-structured language. There are four different types of programs that can be created using SPL, namely *procedures*, *functions*, *triggers*, and *packages*.

In addition, SPL is used to create subprograms. A *subprogram* refers to a *subprocedure* or a *subfunction*, which are nearly identical in appearance to procedures and functions, but differ in that procedures and functions are *standalone programs*, which are individually stored in the database and can be invoked by other SPL programs or from PSQL. Subprograms can only be invoked from within the standalone program within which they have been created.
