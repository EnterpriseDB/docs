<div id="anonymous_blocks" class="registered_link"></div>

Blocks are typically written as part of a procedure, function, subprogram, or trigger. Procedure, function, and trigger programs are named and stored in the database for re-use. For quick (one-time) execution (such as testing), you can simply enter the block without providing a name or storing it in the database.

A block of this type is called an *anonymous block*. An anonymous block is unnamed and is not stored in the database. Once the block has been executed and erased from the application buffer, it cannot be re-executed unless the block code is re-entered into the application.

Typically, the same block of code will be re-executed many times. In order to run a block of code repeatedly without the necessity of re-entering the code each time, with some simple modifications, an anonymous block can be turned into a procedure or function. The following sections discuss how to create a procedure or function that can be stored in the database and invoked repeatedly by another procedure, function, or application program.
