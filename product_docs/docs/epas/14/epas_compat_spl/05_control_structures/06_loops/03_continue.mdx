The `CONTINUE` statement provides a way to proceed with the next iteration of a loop while skipping intervening statements.

When the `CONTINUE` statement is encountered, the next iteration of the innermost loop is begun, skipping all statements following the `CONTINUE` statement until the end of the loop. That is, control is passed back to the loop control expression, if any, and the body of the loop is re-evaluated.

If the `WHEN` clause is used, then the next iteration of the loop is begun only if the specified expression in the `WHEN` clause evaluates to `TRUE`. Otherwise, control is passed to the next statement following the `CONTINUE` statement.

The `CONTINUE` statement may not be used outside of a loop.

The following is a variation of the previous example that uses the `CONTINUE` statement to skip the display of the odd numbers.

```text
DECLARE
    v_counter       NUMBER(2);
BEGIN
    v_counter := 0;
    LOOP
        v_counter := v_counter + 1;
        EXIT WHEN v_counter > 10;
        CONTINUE WHEN MOD(v_counter,2) = 1;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Iteration # ' || v_counter);
    END LOOP;
END;
```

The following is the output from above program.

```text
Iteration # 2
Iteration # 4
Iteration # 6
Iteration # 8
Iteration # 10
```
