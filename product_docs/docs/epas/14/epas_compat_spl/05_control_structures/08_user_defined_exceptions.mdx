<div id="user_defined_exceptions" class="registered_link"></div>

Any number of errors (referred to in PL/SQL as *exceptions*) can occur during program execution. When an exception is *thrown*, normal execution of the program stops, and control of the program transfers to the error-handling portion of the program. An *exception* may be a pre-defined error that is generated by the server, or may be a logical error that raises a user-defined exception.

User-defined exceptions are never raised by the server; they are raised explicitly by a `RAISE` statement. A user-defined exception is raised when a developer-defined logical rule is broken; a common example of a logical rule being broken occurs when a check is presented against an account with insufficient funds. An attempt to cash a check against an account with insufficient funds will provoke a user-defined exception.

You can define exceptions in functions, procedures, packages or anonymous blocks. While you cannot declare the same exception twice in the same block, you can declare the same exception in two different blocks.

Before implementing a user-defined exception, you must declare the exception in the declaration section of a function, procedure, package or anonymous block. You can then raise the exception using the `RAISE` statement:

```text
DECLARE
    <exception_name> EXCEPTION;

BEGIN
    ...
    RAISE <exception_name>;
    ...
END;
```

`exception_name` is the name of the exception.

Unhandled exceptions propagate back through the call stack. If the exception remains unhandled, the exception is eventually reported to the client application.

User-defined exceptions declared in a block are considered to be local to that block, and global to any nested blocks within the block. To reference an exception that resides in an outer block, you must assign a label to the outer block; then, preface the name of the exception with the block name `block_name.exception_name`.

Conversely, outer blocks cannot reference exceptions declared in nested blocks.

The scope of a declaration is limited to the block in which it is declared *unless* it is created in a package, and when referenced, qualified by the package name. For example, to raise an exception named `out_of_stock` that resides in a package named `inventory_control` a program must raise an error named `inventory_control.out_of_stock`.

The following example demonstrates declaring a user-defined exception in a package. The user-defined exception does not require a package-qualifier when it is raised in `check_balance`, since it resides in the same package as the exception:

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE ar AS
  overdrawn EXCEPTION;
  PROCEDURE check_balance(p_balance NUMBER, p_amount NUMBER);
END;

CREATE OR REPLACE PACKAGE BODY ar AS
  PROCEDURE check_balance(p_balance NUMBER, p_amount  NUMBER)
  IS
  BEGIN
      IF (p_amount > p_balance) THEN
        RAISE overdrawn;
      END IF;
   END;
```

The following procedure `(purchase)` calls the `check_balance` procedure. If `p_amount` is greater than `p_balance, check_balance` raises an exception; `purchase` catches the `ar.overdrawn` exception. `purchase` must refer to the exception with a package-qualified name `(ar.overdrawn)` because `purchase` is not defined within the `ar` package.

```text
CREATE PROCEDURE purchase(customerID INT, amount NUMERIC)
AS
  BEGIN
     ar.check_ balance(getcustomerbalance(customerid), amount);
       record_purchase(customerid, amount);
  EXCEPTION
     WHEN ar.overdrawn THEN
       raise_credit_limit(customerid, amount*1.5);
  END;
```

When `ar.check_balance` raises an exception, execution jumps to the exception handler defined in `purchase:`

```text
EXCEPTION
     WHEN ar.overdrawn THEN
       raise_credit_limit(customerid, amount*1.5);
```

The exception handler raises the customer’s credit limit and ends. When the exception handler ends, execution resumes with the statement that follows `ar.check_balance`.
