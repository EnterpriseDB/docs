<div id="goto_statement" class="registered_link"></div>

The `GOTO` statement causes the point of execution to jump to the statement with the specified label. The syntax of a `GOTO` statement is:

```text
GOTO <label>
```

`label` is a name assigned to an executable statement. `label` must be unique within the scope of the function, procedure or anonymous block.

To label a statement, use the syntax:

```text
<<label>> <statement>
```

`statement` is the point of execution that the program jumps to.

You can label assignment statements, any SQL statement (like `INSERT, UPDATE, CREATE`, etc.) and selected procedural language statements. The procedural language statements that can be labeled are:

-   `IF`
-   `EXIT`
-   `RETURN`
-   `RAISE`
-   `EXECUTE`
-   `PERFORM`
-   `GET DIAGNOSTICS`
-   `OPEN`
-   `FETCH`
-   `MOVE`
-   `CLOSE`
-   `NULL`
-   `COMMIT`
-   `ROLLBACK`
-   `GOTO`
-   `CASE`
-   `LOOP`
-   `WHILE`
-   `FOR`

Please note that `exit` is considered a keyword, and cannot be used as the name of a label.

`GOTO` statements cannot transfer control *into* a conditional block or sub-block, but can transfer control *from* a conditional block or sub-block.

The following example verifies that an employee record contains a name, job description, and employee hire date; if any piece of information is missing, a `GOTO` statement transfers the point of execution to a statement that prints a message that the employee is not valid.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE verify_emp (
    p_empno         NUMBER
)
IS
    v_ename         emp.ename%TYPE;
    v_job           emp.job%TYPE;
    v_hiredate      emp.hiredate%TYPE;
BEGIN
    SELECT ename, job, hiredate
        INTO v_ename, v_job, v_hiredate FROM emp
        WHERE empno = p_empno;
    IF v_ename IS NULL THEN
        GOTO invalid_emp;
    END IF;
    IF v_job IS NULL THEN
        GOTO invalid_emp;
    END IF;
    IF v_hiredate IS NULL THEN
        GOTO invalid_emp;
    END IF;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee ' || p_empno ||
        ' validated without errors.');
    RETURN;
    <<invalid_emp>> DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee ' || p_empno ||
        ' is not a valid employee.');
END;
```

`GOTO` statements have the following restrictions:

-   A `GOTO` statement cannot jump to a declaration.
-   A `GOTO` statement cannot transfer control to another function or procedure.
-   A `label` should not be placed at the end of a block, function or procedure.
