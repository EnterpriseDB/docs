SPL programs are written using the following set of characters:

-   Uppercase letters `A` thru `Z` and lowercase letters `a` thru `z`
-   Digits `0` thru `9`
-   Symbols `( ) + - * / < > = ! ~ ^ ; : . ' @ % , " # $ & _ | { } ? [ ]`
-   White space characters tabs, spaces, and carriage returns

Identifiers, expressions, statements, control structures, etc. that comprise the SPL language are written using these characters.

!!! Note
    The data that can be manipulated by an SPL program is determined by the character set supported by the database encoding.
