title: "Case sensitivity"

<div id="case_sensitivity" class="registered_link"></div>

Keywords and user-defined identifiers that are used in an SPL program are case insensitive. So for example, the statement `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello World');` is interpreted to mean the same thing as `dbms_output.put_line('Hello World');` or `Dbms_Output.Put_Line('Hello World');` or `DBMS_output.Put_line('Hello World');`.

Character and string constants, however, are case sensitive as well as any data retrieved from the Advanced Server database or data obtained from other external sources. The statement `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hello World!');` produces the following output:

```text
Hello World!
```

However the statement `DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('HELLO WORLD!');` produces the output:

```text
HELLO WORLD!
```
