In an object type it is permissible to define two or more identically named methods of the same type (this is, either a procedure or function), but with different signatures. Such methods are referred to as *overloaded* methods.

A methodâ€™s signature consists of the number of formal parameters, the data types of its formal parameters, and their order.
