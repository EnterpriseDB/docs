title: "Declaring a Cursor Variable"
---

<div id="declaring_a_cursor_variable" class="registered_link"></div>

SPL supports the declaration of a cursor variable using both the `SYS_REFCURSOR` built-in data type as well as creating a type of `REF CURSOR` and then declaring a variable of that type. `SYS_REFCURSOR` is a `REF CURSOR` type that allows any result set to be associated with it. This is known as a *weakly-typed* `REF CURSOR`.

Only the declaration of `SYS_REFCURSOR` and user-defined `REF CURSOR` variables are different. The remaining usage like opening the cursor, selecting into the cursor and closing the cursor is the same across both the cursor types. For the rest of this chapter our examples will primarily be making use of the `SYS_REFCURSOR` cursors. All you need to change in the examples to make them work for user defined `REF CURSORs` is the declaration section.

!!! Note
    *Strongly-typed* `REF CURSORs` require the result set to conform to a declared number and order of fields with compatible data types and can also optionally return a result set.
