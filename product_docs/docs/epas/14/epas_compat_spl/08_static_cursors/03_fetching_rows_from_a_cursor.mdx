title: "Fetching Rows From a Cursor"

<div id="fetching_rows_from_a_cursor" class="registered_link"></div>

Once a cursor has been opened, rows can be retrieved from the cursorâ€™s result set by using the `FETCH` statement.

```text
FETCH <name> INTO { <record> | <variable> [, <variable_2> ]... };
```

`name` is the identifier of a previously opened cursor. `record` is the identifier of a previously defined record (for example, using `table%ROWTYPE`). `variable, variable_2...` are SPL variables that will receive the field data from the fetched row. The fields in `record` or `variable, variable_2...` must match in number and order, the fields returned in the `SELECT` list of the query given in the cursor declaration. The data types of the fields in the `SELECT` list must match, or be implicitly convertible to the data types of the fields in `record` or the data types of `variable, variable_2...`

!!! Note
    There is a variation of `FETCH INTO` using the `BULK COLLECT` clause that can return multiple rows at a time into a collection. See Section [Using the BULK COLLECT Clause](../12_working_with_collections/04_using_the_bulk_collect_clause/#using_the_bulk_collect_clause) for more information on using the `BULK COLLECT` clause with the `FETCH INTO` statement.

The following shows the `FETCH` statement.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    v_empno         NUMBER(4);
    v_ename         VARCHAR2(10);
    CURSOR emp_cur_3 IS SELECT empno, ename FROM emp WHERE deptno = 10
        ORDER BY empno;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_3;
    FETCH emp_cur_3 INTO v_empno, v_ename;
        ...
END;
```

Instead of explicitly declaring the data type of a target variable, `%TYPE` can be used instead. In this way, if the data type of the database column is changed, the target variable declaration in the SPL program does not have to be changed. `%TYPE` will automatically pick up the new data type of the specified column.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    v_empno         emp.empno%TYPE;
    v_ename         emp.ename%TYPE;
    CURSOR emp_cur_3 IS SELECT empno, ename FROM emp WHERE deptno = 10
        ORDER BY empno;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_3;
    FETCH emp_cur_3 INTO v_empno, v_ename;
        ...
END;
```

If all the columns in a table are retrieved in the order defined in the table, `%ROWTYPE` can be used to define a record into which the `FETCH` statement will place the retrieved data. Each field within the record can then be accessed using dot notation.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    v_emp_rec       emp%ROWTYPE;
    CURSOR emp_cur_1 IS SELECT * FROM emp;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_1;
    FETCH emp_cur_1 INTO v_emp_rec;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee Number: ' || v_emp_rec.empno);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee Name  : ' || v_emp_rec.ename);
        ...
END;
```
