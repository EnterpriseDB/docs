title: "Closing a Cursor"

<div id="closing_a_cursor" class="registered_link"></div>

Once all the desired rows have been retrieved from the cursor result set, the cursor must be closed. Once closed, the result set is no longer accessible. The `CLOSE` statement appears as follows:

```text
CLOSE <name>;
```

`name` is the identifier of a cursor that is currently open. Once a cursor is closed, it must not be closed again. However, once the cursor is closed, the `OPEN` statement can be issued again on the closed cursor and the query result set will be rebuilt after which the `FETCH` statement can then be used to retrieve the rows of the new result set.

The following example illustrates the use of the `CLOSE` statement:

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    v_emp_rec       emp%ROWTYPE;
    CURSOR emp_cur_1 IS SELECT * FROM emp;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_1;
    FETCH emp_cur_1 INTO v_emp_rec;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee Number: ' || v_emp_rec.empno);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee Name  : ' || v_emp_rec.ename);
    CLOSE emp_cur_1;
END;
```

This procedure produces the following output when invoked. Employee number `7369, SMITH` is the first row of the result set.

```text
EXEC cursor_example;

Employee Number: 7369
Employee Name  : SMITH
```
