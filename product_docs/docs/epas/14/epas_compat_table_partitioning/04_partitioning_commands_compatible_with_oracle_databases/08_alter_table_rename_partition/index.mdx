<div id="alter_table_rename_partition" class="registered_link"></div>

Use the `ALTER TABLE… RENAME PARTITION` command to rename a table partition. The syntax takes two forms.

The first form renames a partition:

```text
ALTER TABLE <table_name>
 RENAME PARTITION <partition_name>
 TO <new_name>;
```

The second form renames a subpartition:

```text
ALTER TABLE <table_name>
 RENAME SUBPARTITION <subpartition_name>
 TO <new_name>;
```

**Description**

The `ALTER TABLE… RENAME PARTITION` command renames a partition.

The same behavior as previously described applies for the `subpartition_name` used with the `RENAME SUBPARTITION` clause.

You must own the specified table to invoke `ALTER TABLE… RENAME PARTITION` or `ALTER TABLE… RENAME SUBPARTITION`.

**Parameters**

`table_name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table in which the partition or subpartition resides.

`partition_name`

 The name of the partition to be renamed.

`subpartition_name`

 The name of the subpartition to be renamed.

`new_name`

 The new name of the partition or subpartition.
