<div id="alter_table_truncate_partition" class="registered_link"></div>

Use the `ALTER TABLE… TRUNCATE PARTITION` command to remove the data from the specified partition, leaving the partition structure intact. The syntax is:

```text
ALTER TABLE <table_name> TRUNCATE PARTITION <partition_name>
  [{DROP|REUSE} STORAGE]
```

**Parameters**

`table_name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the partitioned table.

`partition_name`

 The name of the partition to be deleted.

**Description**

Use the `ALTER TABLE… TRUNCATE PARTITION` command to remove the data from the specified partition, leaving the partition structure intact. When you truncate a partition, any subpartitions of that partition are also truncated.

`ALTER TABLE… TRUNCATE PARTITION` will not cause `ON DELETE` triggers that might exist for the table to fire, but it will fire `ON TRUNCATE` triggers. If an `ON TRUNCATE` trigger is defined for the partition, all `BEFORE TRUNCATE` triggers are fired before any truncation happens, and all `AFTER TRUNCATE` triggers are fired after the last truncation occurs.

You must have the `TRUNCATE` privilege on a table to invoke `ALTER TABLE… TRUNCATE PARTITION`.

`DROP STORAGE` and `REUSE STORAGE` are included for compatibility only; the clauses are parsed and ignored.
