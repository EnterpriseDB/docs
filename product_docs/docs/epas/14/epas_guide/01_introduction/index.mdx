title: "Whatâ€™s New"
---

The following features have been changed in EDB Postgres Advanced Server 13 to create Advanced Server 14:

-   Advanced Server now supports `AS` clause to alias a table, view, materialized view, or a subquery to be referenced in the `INSERT` statement. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers SQL Guide*.
-   Advanced Server now supports `SET` command with `edb_audit_statement` parameter to audit `SET` statements. For information, see [EDB Audit Logging](../03_database_administration/05_edb_audit_logging/#edb_audit_logging).
-   Advanced Server has added support to accept the `NUMBER` type values in the `DBMS_SQL` function. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Built-in Package Guide*.
-   Advanced Server has added support to include default database tablespace `PG_DEFAULT` if the tablespace name is not specified. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Catalog Views Guide*. 
-   Advanced Server has added the `GET_RAW` and `PUT_RAW` APIs in the `UTL_FILE` package to read and write the `RAW` data value. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Built-in Package Guide*.
-   Advanced Server has added support for accessing a `PARTITION` or `SUBPARTITION` using `PARTITION part_name` or `SUBPARTITION subpart_name`. For information, see the *Database Compatibility Table Partitioning Guide*.
-   Advanced Server now supports `USERENV` and `SYS_CONTEXT` functions to retrieve information about the current session. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Reference Guide*.
-   Advanced Server now supports bitwise function `BITAND` and `BITOR` and bitwise aggregation function `BIT_AND_AGG`, and `BIT_OR_AGG`, which performs a bitwise `AND` or `OR` operation and returns a value based on the data type of input argument. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Reference Guide*.
-   Advanced Server has added support to create partitioned tables with unique `ROWID` by setting the parameter `default_with_rowids = true`. For information, see the *Database Compatibility Table Partitioning Guide*.
-   Advanced Server introduces *Audit Log Archiving*, which allows the database to archive audit log files. For information, see [EDB Audit Logging](../03_database_administration/05_edb_audit_logging/#edb_audit_logging).
-   Advanced Server introduces support for `SUBPARTITION TEMPLATE` with a list, range, or hash subpartitioning to create default subpartitions for each table partition. For information, see the *Database Compatibility Table Partitioning Guide*.
-   Advanced Server now supports *Object Auditing* that allows selective auditing of objects for specific DML statements such as `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, and `INSERT` with including or excluding certain groups by specifying `(@)` or `(-)` with the `edb_audit_statement` parameter. For information, see [Object Auditing](../03_database_administration/05_edb_audit_logging/09_object_auditing/#object_auditing).
-   Advanced Server has added enhancements to the `CONNECT BY` clause, which specifies the relationship between a parent record and its child records of the hierarchy. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Guide*.
-   Advanced Server has added support for `ALIAS` for accessing a `PARTITION` or `SUBPARTITION` with `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements. For information, see the *Database Compatibility Table Partitioning Guide*.
-   Advanced Server has added support to store the create and last DDL time when a DDL operation is performed on an object. For information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Catalog Views Guide*.

## Limitations

The following table describes various hard limits of PostgreSQL. However, practical limits such as performance limitations or available disk space may apply before absolute hard limits are reached.

!!! Note
    -   The maximum number of columns for a table is further reduced as the tuple being stored must fit in a single 8192-byte heap page. For example, excluding the tuple header, a tuple made up of 1600 `int` columns would consume 6400 bytes and could be stored in a heap page, but a tuple of 1600 `bigint` columns would consume 12800 bytes and would therefore not fit inside a heap page. Variable-length fields of types such as `text`, `varchar`, and `char` can have their values stored out of line in the table's `TOAST` table when the values are large enough to require it. Only an 18-byte pointer must remain inside the tuple in the table's heap. For shorter length variable-length fields, either a 4-byte or 1-byte field header is used and the value is stored inside the heap tuple.

    -   Columns that have been dropped from the table also contribute to the maximum column limit. Moreover, although the dropped column values for newly created tuples are internally marked as null in the tuple's null bitmap, the null bitmap also occupies space.
