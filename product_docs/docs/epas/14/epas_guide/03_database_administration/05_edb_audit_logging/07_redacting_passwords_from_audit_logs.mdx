title: "Redacting Passwords in Audit Logs"

You can use the GUC parameter `edb_filter_log.redact_password_commands` under the `postgresql.conf` file to instruct the server to redact stored passwords in the log file. 

The syntax is:

```text
{CREATE|ALTER} {USER|ROLE|GROUP} identifier { [WITH] [ENCRYPTED] PASSWORD
'nonempty_string_literal' | IDENTIFIED BY { 'nonempty_string_literal' |
bareword } } [ REPLACE { 'nonempty_string_literal' | bareword } ]
```

To enable password redaction, you must first enable the parameter by modifying the `postgresql.conf` file, adding the following value to the values specified in the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter:

```text
$libdir/edb_filter_log
```

Then, set `edb_filter_log.redact_password_commands` to `true`:

```text
edb_filter_log.redact_password_commands = true
```

After modifying the `postgresql.conf` file, you must restart the server for the changes to take effect.

**Examples**

When the following statement is logged by `log_statement`, the server will redact the password to `x`. For example, the command:

```text
CREATE USER carol with login PASSWORD '1safepwd';
```

Will be added to log files as:

```text
2021-05-17 05:01:46.841 IST,"enterprisedb","edb",18415,"[local]",60a230f0.47ef,1,"idle",2021-05-17 05:01:36 IST,3/3,0,AUDIT,00000,"statement: CREATE USER carol with login PASSWORD 'x';",,,,,,,,,"psql","client backend","CREATE ROLE","","create"
```

When the following statement is logged by `log_statement`, the server will identify the new password, replace, and redact the password to `x`. For example, the command:
 
```text
ALTER USER carol IDENTIFIED BY 'new_pass' REPLACE '1safepwd'; 
```

Will be added to log files as:

```text
2021-05-19 04:41:45.718 IST,"enterprisedb","edb",19354,"[local]",60a23a72.4b9a,1,"idle",2021-05-19 04:41:23 IST,3/3,0,AUDIT,00000,"statement: ALTER USER carol IDENTIFIED BY 'x' REPLACE 'x';",,,,,,,,,"psql","client backend","ALTER ROLE","","alter"
```

The statement that includes a password is logged, the server redacts the password text to `x`. When the statement is logged as context for some other message, the server omits the statement from the context.
