Sets the planner's assumption about the effective size of the disk cache that is available to a single query. This is factored into estimates of the cost of using an index; a higher value makes it more likely index scans are used, a lower value makes it more likely sequential scans are used. When setting this parameter you should consider both EDB Postgres Advanced Serverâ€™s shared buffers and the portion of the kernel's disk cache that are used for EDB Postgres Advanced Server data files. Also, take into account the expected number of concurrent queries on different tables, since they have to share the available space. This parameter has no effect on the size of shared memory allocated by EDB Postgres Advanced Server, nor does it reserve kernel disk cache; it is used only for estimation purposes. The default is 128 megabytes (`128MB`).

If this parameter is set too low, the planner may decide not to use an index even when it would be beneficial to do so. Setting `effective_cache_size` to 50% of physical memory is a normal, conservative setting. A more aggressive setting would be approximately 75% of physical memory.
