Configuration parameters in this section apply to Advanced Server only and are for a specific, limited purpose.

## nls_length_semantics

**Parameter type:** Enum

**Default value:** `byte`

**Range:** `{byte | char}`

**Minimum scope of effect:** Per session

**When value changes take effect:** Immediate

**Required authorization to activate:** Superuser

This parameter has no effect in Advanced Server.

For example, the form of the `ALTER SESSION` command is accepted in Advanced Server without throwing a syntax error, but does not alter the session environment:

```text
ALTER SESSION SET nls_length_semantics = char;
```

!!! Note
    Since the setting of this parameter has no effect on the server environment, it does not appear in the system view `pg_settings`.

## query_rewrite_enabled

**Parameter type:** Enum

**Default value:** `false`

**Range:** `{true | false | force}`

**Minimum scope of effect:** Per session

**When value changes take effect:** Immediate

**Required authorization to activate:** Session user

This parameter has no effect in Advanced Server.

For example, the following form of the `ALTER SESSION` command is accepted in Advanced Server without throwing a syntax error, but does not alter the session environment:

```text
ALTER SESSION SET query_rewrite_enabled = force;
```

!!! Note
    Since the setting of this parameter has no effect on the server environment, it does not appear in the system view `pg_settings`.

## query_rewrite_integrity

**Parameter type:** Enum

**Default value:** `enforced`

**Range:** `{enforced | trusted | stale_tolerated}`

**Minimum scope of effect:** Per session

**When value changes take effect:** Immediate

**Required authorization to activate:** Superuser

This parameter has no effect in Advanced Server.

For example, the following form of the `ALTER SESSION` command is accepted in Advanced Server without throwing a syntax error, but does not alter the session environment:

```text
ALTER SESSION SET query_rewrite_integrity = stale_tolerated;
```

!!! Note
    Since the setting of this parameter has no effect on the server environment, it does not appear in the system view `pg_settings`.

## timed_statistics

**Parameter type:** Boolean

**Default value:** `true`

**Range:** `{true | false}`

**Minimum scope of effect:** Per session

**When value changes take effect:** Immediate

**Required authorization to activate:** Session user

Controls the collection of timing data for the Dynamic Runtime Instrumentation Tools Architecture (DRITA) feature. When set to on, timing data is collected.

!!! Note
    When Advanced Server is installed, the `postgresql.conf` file contains an explicit entry setting `timed_statistics` to off. If this entry is commented out letting `timed_statistics` to default, and the configuration file is reloaded, timed statistics collection would be turned on.
