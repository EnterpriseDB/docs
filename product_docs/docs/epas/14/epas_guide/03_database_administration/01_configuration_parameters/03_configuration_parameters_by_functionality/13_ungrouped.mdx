These configuration parameters apply only to EDB Postgres Advanced Server and are for a specific, limited purpose.

## nls_length_semantics

**Parameter type:** Enum

**Default value:** `byte`

**Range:** `{byte | char}`

**Minimum scope of effect:** Per session

**When value changes take effect:** Immediate

**Required authorization to activate:** Superuser

This parameter has no effect in EDB Postgres Advanced Server. For example, this form of the `ALTER SESSION` command is accepted in EDB Postgres Advanced Server without throwing a syntax error. However, it doesn't alter the session environment.

```text
ALTER SESSION SET nls_length_semantics = char;
```

!!! Note
    Since setting this parameter has no effect on the server environment, it doesn't appear in the system view `pg_settings`.

## query_rewrite_enabled

**Parameter type:** Enum

**Default value:** `false`

**Range:** `{true | false | force}`

**Minimum scope of effect:** Per session

**When value changes take effect:** Immediate

**Required authorization to activate:** Session user

This parameter has no effect in EDB Postgres Advanced Server. For example, this form of the `ALTER SESSION` command is accepted in EDB Postgres Advanced Server without throwing a syntax error. However, it doesn't alter the session environment.

```text
ALTER SESSION SET query_rewrite_enabled = force;
```

!!! Note
    Since setting this parameter has no effect on the server environment, it doesn't appear in the system view `pg_settings`.

## query_rewrite_integrity

**Parameter type:** Enum

**Default value:** `enforced`

**Range:** `{enforced | trusted | stale_tolerated}`

**Minimum scope of effect:** Per session

**When value changes take effect:** Immediate

**Required authorization to activate:** Superuser

This parameter has no effect in EDB Postgres Advanced Server. For example, this form of the `ALTER SESSION` command is accepted in EDB Postgres Advanced Server without throwing a syntax error. However, it doesn't alter the session environment.

```text
ALTER SESSION SET query_rewrite_integrity = stale_tolerated;
```

!!! Note
    Since setting this parameter has no effect on the server environment, it doesn't appear in the system view `pg_settings`.

## timed_statistics

**Parameter type:** Boolean

**Default value:** `true`

**Range:** `{true | false}`

**Minimum scope of effect:** Per session

**When value changes take effect:** Immediate

**Required authorization to activate:** Session user

Controls collecting timing data for the Dynamic Runtime Instrumentation Tools Architecture (DRITA) feature. When set to `on`, timing data is collected.

!!! Note
    When EDB Postgres Advanced Server is installed, the `postgresql.conf` file contains an explicit entry that sets `timed_statistics` to `off`. If this entry is commented out and the configuration file is reloaded, timed statistics collection uses the default value, which is `on`.
