Sets the amount of memory the database server uses for shared memory buffers. The default is typically 32 megabytes (`32MB`), but might be less if your kernel settings will not support it (as determined during `initdb`). This setting must be at least 128 kilobytes. (Non-default values of `BLCKSZ` change the minimum.) However, settings significantly higher than the minimum are usually needed for good performance.

If you have a dedicated database server with 1GB or more of RAM, a reasonable starting value for `shared_buffers` is 25% of the memory in your system. There are some workloads where even large settings for `shared_buffers` are effective, but because Advanced Server also relies on the operating system cache, it is unlikely that an allocation of more than 40% of RAM to `shared_buffers` will work better than a smaller amount.

On systems with less than 1GB of RAM, a smaller percentage of RAM is appropriate, so as to leave adequate space for the operating system (15% of memory is more typical in these situations). Also, on Windows, large values for `shared_buffers` aren't as effective. You may find better results keeping the setting relatively low and using the operating system cache more instead. The useful range for `shared_buffers` on Windows systems is generally from 64MB to 512MB.

Increasing this parameter might cause Advanced Server to request more System V shared memory than your operating system's default configuration allows. See the section `Shared Memory and Semaphores` in the *PostgreSQL Core Documentation* for information on how to adjust those parameters, if necessary.
