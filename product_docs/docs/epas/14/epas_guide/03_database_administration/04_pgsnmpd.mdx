!!! Note
    'pgsnnmpd' is deprecated as of EDB Postgres Advanced Server v14. It isn't included in EDB Postgres Advanced Server v15 and later.

`pgsnmpd` is an SNMP agent that can return hierarchical information about the current state of EDB Postgres Advanced Server on a Linux system. `pgsnmpd` is distributed and installed using the `edb-asxx-pgsnmpd` RPM package, where `xx` is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version number. The `pgsnmpd` agent can operate as a standalone SNMP agent, as a pass-through subagent, or as an AgentX subagent.

After installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you must update the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable:

```text
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/edb/as14/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

This command doesn't persistently alter the value of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. See the documentation for your distribution of Linux for information about persistently setting the value of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

The examples that follow show the simplest use of `pgsnmpd`, implementing read-only access. `pgsnmpd` is based on the net-snmp library. For more information about net-snmp, see the [net-snmp documentation](http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/).

## Configuring pgsnmpd

The `pgsnmpd` configuration file is named `snmpd.conf`. For information about the directives that you can specify in the configuration file, see the `snmpd.conf` man page (`man snmpd.conf`).

You can create the configuration file by hand, or you can use the `snmpconf` perl script to create the configuration file. The perl script is distributed with the net-snmp package. net-snmp is an open-source package available from <http://www.net-snmp.org/>.

To use the snmpconf configuration file wizard, download and install net-snmp. When the installation completes, at the command line, enter:

```text
snmpconf
```

When the configuration file wizard opens, it might prompt you to read in an existing configuration file. Enter `none` to generate a new configuration file that isn't based on a previously existing configuration file.

`snmpconf` is a menu-driven wizard. Select the menu item `1: snmpd.conf` to start the configuration wizard. As you select each top-level menu option displayed by `snmpconf`, the wizard walks you through a series of questions, prompting you for information required to build the configuration file. After you provide information in each category relevant to your system, enter `Finished` to generate a configuration file named `snmpd.conf`. Copy the file to:

```text
/usr/edb/as14/share/
```

## Setting the listener address

By default, `pgsnmpd` listens on port `161`. If the listener port is already being used by another service, you might receive the following error:

```text
Error opening specified endpoint "udp:161".
```

You can specify an alternative listener port by adding the following line to your `snmpd.conf` file:

```text
agentaddress $host_address:2000
```

This example instructs `pgsnmpd` to listen on UDP port `2000`, where `$host_address` is the IP address of the server (e.g., `127.0.0.1`).

Before invoking `pgsnmpd`, you must create the `pgsnmpd` schema and set the search path to create tables in the `pgsnmpd` schema using the following commands:

```text
CREATE SCHEMA pgsnmpd;
SET search_path = pgsnmpd;
\i pgsnmpd.sql
```

## Invoking pgsnmpd

Ensure that an instance of EDB Postgres Advanced Server is up and running. (`pgsnmpd` connects to this server.) Open a command line and assume superuser privileges. Then, invoke pgsnmpd with a command in the following form:

```text
POSTGRES_INSTALL_HOME/bin/pgsnmpd -b
  -c POSTGRES_INSTALL_HOME/share/snmpd.conf
  -C "user=enterprisedb dbname=edb password=safe_password
      port=5444"
```

Where `POSTGRES_INSTALL_HOME` specifies the EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation directory.

Include the `-b` option to specify for `pgsnmpd` to run in the background.

Include the `-c` option, specifying the path and name of the `pgsnmpd` configuration file.

After the `-C` option, include connection information for your installation of EDB Postgres Advanced Server in the form of a `libpq` connection string.

## Viewing pgsnmpd help

Include the `--help` option when invoking the `pgsnmpd` utility to view other `pgsnmpd` command line options:

```text
pgsnmpd --help
  Version PGSQL-SNMP-Ver1.0
  usage: pgsnmpd [-s] [-b] [-c FILE ] [-x address ] [-g] [-C "Connect String"]
     -s : run as AgentX sub-agent of an existing snmpd process
     -b : run in the background
     -c : configuration file name
     -g : use syslog
     -C : libpq connection string
     -x : address:port of a network interface
     -V : display version strings
```

## Requesting information from pgsnmpd

You can use `net-snmp` commands to query the `pgsnmpd` service. For example:

```text
snmpgetnext -v 2c -c public localhost .1.3.6.1.4.1.5432.1.4.2.1.1.0
```

Where:

`-v 2c` option instructs the `snmpgetnext` client to send the request in SNMP version 2c format.

`-c public` specifies the community name.

`localhost` indicates the host machine running the `pgsnmpd` server.

`.1.3.6.1.4.1.5432.1.4.2.1.1.0` is the identity of the requested object. To see a list of all databases, increment the last digit by one (for example, .1.1, .1.2, .1.3).

The encodings required to query any given object are defined in the management information base (MIB). An SNMP client can monitor a variety of servers. The server type determines the information exposed by a given server. Each SNMP server describes the exposed data in the form of a MIB. By default, pgsnmpd searches for MIBs in the following locations:

```text
/usr/share/snmp/mibs

$HOME/.snmp/mibs
```
