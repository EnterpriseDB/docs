<div id="dblink_ora" class="registered_link"></div>

dblink_ora enables you to issue arbitrary queries to a remote Oracle server. dblink_ora provides an OCI-based database link that allows you to `SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE` or `DELETE` data stored on an Oracle system from within Advanced Server.

## Connecting to an Oracle database

To enable Oracle connectivity, download Oracle's freely available OCI drivers from their website, presently at:
<http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/instant-client/overview/index.html>

For Linux, if the Oracle instant client that you've downloaded does not include the `libclntsh.so` library, you must create a symbolic link named `libclntsh.so` that points to the downloaded version. Navigate to the instant client directory and execute the following command:

```text
ln -s libclntsh.so.<version> libclntsh.so
```

Where `version` is the version number of the `libclntsh.so` library. For example:

```text
ln -s libclntsh.so.12.1 libclntsh.so
```

Before creating a link to an Oracle server, you must direct Advanced Server to the correct Oracle home directory. Set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable on Linux (or `PATH` on Windows) to the `lib` directory of the Oracle client installation directory.

Alternatively, you can also set the value of the `oracle_home` configuration parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file. The value specified in the `oracle_home` configuration parameter will override the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable in Linux and `PATH` environment variable in Windows.

!!! Note
    The `oracle_home` configuration parameter should provide the correct path to the Oracle client i.e. `OCI` library.

To set the `oracle_home` configuration parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file, edit the file, adding the following line:

```text
oracle_home = 'lib_directory'
```

Substitute the name of the `oracle_home` path to the Oracle client installation directory that contains `libclntsh.so` in Linux and `oci.dll` in Windows for `lib_directory`.

After setting the `oracle_home` configuration parameter, you must restart the server for the changes to take effect. Restart the server,

-   on Linux, using the `systemctl` command or `pg_ctl` services.

-   on Windows, from the Windows Services console.
