A *hierarchical query* is a type of query that returns the rows of the result set in a hierarchical order based upon data forming a parent-child relationship. A hierarchy is typically represented by an inverted tree structure. The tree is comprised of interconnected *nodes*. Each node may be connected to none, one, or multiple *child* nodes. Each node is connected to one *parent* node except for the top node which has no parent. This node is the *root* node. Each tree has exactly one root node. Nodes that don’t have any children are called *leaf* nodes. A tree always has at least one leaf node - e.g., the trivial case where the tree is comprised of a single node. In this case it is both the root and the leaf.

In a hierarchical query the rows of the result set represent the nodes of one or more trees.

!!! Note
    It is possible that a single, given row may appear in more than one tree and thus appear more than once in the result set.

The hierarchical relationship in a query is described by the `CONNECT BY` clause which forms the basis of the order in which rows are returned in the result set. The context of where the `CONNECT BY` clause and its associated optional clauses appear in the `SELECT` command is shown below.

```text
SELECT <select_list> FROM <table_expression> [ WHERE ...]
  [ START WITH <start_expression> ]
    { CONNECT BY <condition> }
  [ ORDER SIBLINGS BY <column1> [ ASC | DESC ]
      [, <column2> [ ASC | DESC ] ] ...
  [ GROUP BY ...]
  [ HAVING ...]
  [ <other> ...]
```

`select_list` is one or more expressions that comprise the fields of the result set. `table_expression` is one or more tables or views from which the rows of the result set originate. `other` is any additional legal `SELECT` command clauses. 

`CONNECT BY` specifies the relationship between a parent record and its child records of the hierarchy. 

-  The `PRIOR` keyword can be specified with only one expression within a condition in the `CONNECT BY` clause. It must be specified with either right or left expression to refer to a parent row in a hierarchical query. For example:

   ```text
   PRIOR expr = expr
   or
   expr = PRIOR expr
   ```

-  If the `CONNECT BY condition` is compound, only one condition requires the `PRIOR` keyword, although there can be multiple `PRIOR` conditions.

-  `PRIOR` keyword can be used to evaluate the parent row in a parent-child relationship in a hierarchical query. 

-  `PRIOR` keyword cannot be used with unary expressions.

-  `PRIOR` keyword can be used to add a pseudo-column for each record corresponding to an expression in a target list. The pseudo-column represents a parent record's actual value when referenced in a child query using `PRIOR` expression.

You can further enhance the functionality of the `CONNECT BY [PRIOR]` condition by using the `CONNECT_BY_ROOT` operator. This operator returns not only immediate parent rows but also all ancestors rows in the hierarchy. For more information, see [Retrieving the Root Node with CONNECT_BY_ROOT](../05_hierarchical_queries/06_retrieving_the_root_node_with_connect_by_root/#retrieving_the_root_node_with_connect_by_root).

**Examples**

The following example uses the `CONNECT BY` clause with `PRIOR` to define a relationship between employees and managers. Using the `LEVEL` value, the employee names are indented to further emphasize the depth in the hierarchy of each row.

```text
SELECT LPAD(ename,length(ename)+2 *(LEVEL - 1),' ') AS employee, empno, mgr, LEVEL 
FROM emp 
CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr AND PRIOR emp.deptno = emp.deptno;
```

The output from this query follows.

```text
employee    | empno | mgr  | level 
------------+-------+------+-------
 SMITH      |  7369 | 7902 |     1
 ALLEN      |  7499 | 7698 |     1
 WARD       |  7521 | 7698 |     1
 JONES      |  7566 | 7839 |     1
   FORD     |  7902 | 7566 |     2
     SMITH  |  7369 | 7902 |     3
   SCOTT    |  7788 | 7566 |     2
     ADAMS  |  7876 | 7788 |     3
 MARTIN     |  7654 | 7698 |     1

   MILLER   |  7934 | 7782 |     2
 SCOTT      |  7788 | 7566 |     1
   ADAMS    |  7876 | 7788 |     2
 KING       |  7839 |      |     1
   CLARK    |  7782 | 7839 |     2
     MILLER |  7934 | 7782 |     3
 TURNER     |  7844 | 7698 |     1

   SMITH    |  7369 | 7902 |     2
 MILLER     |  7934 | 7782 |     1
(28 rows)
```

The following example adds the `ORDER BY` clause and a compound condition with `AND` operator in `CONNECT BY` clause to show employee and manager hierarchy.

```text
SELECT LPAD(ename,length(ename)+2 *(LEVEL - 1),' ') AS employee, empno, mgr, LEVEL
FROM emp
CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr AND LEVEL <= 3
ORDER BY LEVEL, ename;
```

The output from this query follows.

```text
employee    | empno | mgr  | level 
------------+-------+------+-------
 ADAMS      |  7876 | 7788 |     1
 ALLEN      |  7499 | 7698 |     1
 BLAKE      |  7698 | 7839 |     1
 CLARK      |  7782 | 7839 |     1
 FORD       |  7902 | 7566 |     1
 JAMES      |  7900 | 7698 |     1
 JONES      |  7566 | 7839 |     1
 KING       |  7839 |      |     1

   CLARK    |  7782 | 7839 |     2
   FORD     |  7902 | 7566 |     2
   JAMES    |  7900 | 7698 |     2
   JONES    |  7566 | 7839 |     2
   MARTIN   |  7654 | 7698 |     2

   WARD     |  7521 | 7698 |     2
     ADAMS  |  7876 | 7788 |     3
     ALLEN  |  7499 | 7698 |     3
     FORD   |  7902 | 7566 |     3
     JAMES  |  7900 | 7698 |     3
     MARTIN |  7654 | 7698 |     3
     MILLER |  7934 | 7782 |     3
     SCOTT  |  7788 | 7566 |     3
     SMITH  |  7369 | 7902 |     3
     TURNER |  7844 | 7698 |     3
     WARD   |  7521 | 7698 |     3
(37 rows)
```

The following example uses the `PRIOR` keyword to return the employee name and manager name for each employee.

```text
SELECT ename, PRIOR ename AS mgr FROM emp START WITH mgr 
IS NULL CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr ORDER BY ename;
```

The output from this query follows.

```text
ename   |  mgr  
--------+-------
 ADAMS  | SCOTT
 ALLEN  | BLAKE
 BLAKE  | KING
 CLARK  | KING
 FORD   | JONES
 JAMES  | BLAKE
 JONES  | KING
 KING   | 
 MARTIN | BLAKE
 MILLER | CLARK
 SCOTT  | JONES
 SMITH  | FORD
 TURNER | BLAKE
 WARD   | BLAKE
(14 rows)
```

The following example uses `CONNECT BY` clause with an optional `PRIOR` statement to show the level value.

```text
SELECT LEVEL
FROM DUAL
CONNECT BY LEVEL <= 5;
```

The output from this query follows.

```text
level 
--------
     1
     2
     3
     4
     5
(5 rows)
```
