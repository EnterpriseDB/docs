<div id="rollup_extension" class="registered_link"></div>

The `ROLLUP` extension produces a hierarchical set of groups with subtotals for each hierarchical group as well as a grand total. The order of the hierarchy is determined by the order of the expressions given in the `ROLLUP` expression list. The top of the hierarchy is the leftmost item in the list. Each successive item proceeding to the right moves down the hierarchy with the rightmost item being the lowest level.

The syntax for a single `ROLLUP` is as follows:

```text
ROLLUP ( { <expr_1> | ( <expr_1a> [, <expr_1b> ] ...) }
  [, <expr_2> | ( <expr_2a> [, <expr_2b> ] ...) ] ...)
```

Each `expr` is an expression that determines the grouping of the result set. If enclosed within parenthesis as `( expr_1a, expr_1b, ...)` then the combination of values returned by `expr_1a` and `expr_1b` defines a single grouping level of the hierarchy.

The base level of aggregates returned in the result set is for each unique combination of values returned by the expression list.

In addition, a subtotal is returned for the first item in the list (`expr_1` or the combination of `( expr_1a, expr_1b, ...)`, whichever is specified) for each unique value. A subtotal is returned for the second item in the list (`expr_2` or the combination of `( expr_2a, expr_2b, ...)`, whichever is specified) for each unique value, within each grouping of the first item and so on. Finally a grand total is returned for the entire result set.

For the subtotal rows, null is returned for the items across which the subtotal is taken.

The `ROLLUP` extension specified within the context of the `GROUP BY` clause is shown by the following:

```text
SELECT <select_list> FROM ...
GROUP BY [... ,] ROLLUP ( <expression_list> ) [, ...]
```

The items specified in `select_list` must also appear in the `ROLLUP expression_list`; or they must be aggregate functions such as `COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN,` or `MAX`; or they must be constants or functions whose return values are independent of the individual rows in the group (for example, the `SYSDATE` function).

The `GROUP BY` clause may specify multiple `ROLLUP` extensions as well as multiple occurrences of other `GROUP BY` extensions and individual expressions.

The `ORDER BY` clause should be used if you want the output to display in a hierarchical or other meaningful structure. There is no guarantee on the order of the result set if no `ORDER BY` clause is specified.

The number of grouping levels or totals is *n* + *1* where *n* represents the number of items in the `ROLLUP` expression list. A parenthesized list counts as one item.

The following query produces a rollup based on a hierarchy of columns `loc, dname`, then `job`.

```text
SELECT loc, dname, job, COUNT(*) AS "employees" FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY ROLLUP (loc, dname, job)
ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;
```

The following is the result of the query. There is a count of the number of employees for each unique combination of `loc, dname`, and `job`, as well as subtotals for each unique combination of `loc` and `dname`, for each unique value of `loc`, and a grand total displayed on the last line.

```text

```

The following query shows the effect of combining items in the `ROLLUP` list within parenthesis.

```text
SELECT loc, dname, job, COUNT(*) AS "employees" FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY ROLLUP (loc, (dname, job))
ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;
```

In the output, note that there are no subtotals for `loc` and `dname` combinations as in the prior example.

```text
loc      |   dname    |    job    | employees
---------+------------+-----------+-----------
BOSTON   | OPERATIONS | ANALYST   |         1
BOSTON   | OPERATIONS | CLERK     |         1
BOSTON   | OPERATIONS | MANAGER   |         1
BOSTON   | RESEARCH   | ANALYST   |         2
BOSTON   | RESEARCH   | CLERK     |         2
BOSTON   | RESEARCH   | MANAGER   |         1
BOSTON   |            |           |         8
CHICAGO  | SALES      | CLERK     |         1
CHICAGO  | SALES      | MANAGER   |         1
CHICAGO  | SALES      | SALESMAN  |         4
CHICAGO  |            |           |         6
NEW YORK | ACCOUNTING | CLERK     |         1
NEW YORK | ACCOUNTING | MANAGER   |         1
NEW YORK | ACCOUNTING | PRESIDENT |         1
NEW YORK |            |           |         3
         |            |           |        17
(16 rows)
```

If the first two columns in the `ROLLUP` list are enclosed in parenthesis, the subtotal levels differ as well.

```text
SELECT loc, dname, job, COUNT(*) AS "employees" FROM emp e, dept d
WHERE e.deptno = d.deptno
GROUP BY ROLLUP ((loc, dname), job)
ORDER BY 1, 2, 3;
```

Now there is a subtotal for each unique `loc` and `dname` combination, but none for unique values of `loc`.

```text
loc      |   dname    |    job    | employees
