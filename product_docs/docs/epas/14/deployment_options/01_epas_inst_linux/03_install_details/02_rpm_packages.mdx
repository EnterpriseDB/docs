title: "RPM Packages"
---



The tables that follow list the RPM packages that are available from EDB. You can also use the `yum search` or `dnf search` command to access a list of the packages that are currently available from your configured repository. Open a command line, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

On RHEL or CentOS 7:

```text
yum search <package>
```

On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8:

```text
dnf search <package>
```

Where `package` is the search term that specifies the name (or partial name) of a package.

Please note: The available package list is subject to change.

### Advanced Server Debian Packages

The table that follows lists some of the Debian packages that are available from EDB. You can also use the `apt list` command to access a list of the packages that are currently available from your configured repository. Open a command line, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

```text
apt list edb*
```

Please note: The available package list is subject to change.

This table has the core components.

| edb-pgpool41                     | This package contains the pgPool-II installer. The pgpool-II utility package acts as a middleman between client applications and Server database servers. pgpool-II functionality is transparent to client applications; client applications connect to pgpool-II instead of directly to Advanced Server, and pgpool-II manages the connection. EDB supports the following pgpool-II features: <br /> -   Load balancing   <br /> -   Connection pooling   <br /> -   High availability   <br /> -   Connection limits   <br /><br /><br />pgpool-II runs as a service on Linux systems, and is not supported on Windows systems.<br /> |
