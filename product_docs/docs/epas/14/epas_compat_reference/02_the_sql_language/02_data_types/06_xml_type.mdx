<div id="xml_type" class="registered_link"></div>

The `XMLTYPE` data type is used to store XML data. Its advantage over storing XML data in a character field is that it checks the input values for well-formedness, and there are support functions to perform type-safe operations on it.

The XML type can store well-formed “documents”, as defined by the XML standard, as well as “content” fragments, which are defined by the production `XMLDecl? content` in the XML standard. Roughly, this means that content fragments can have more than one top-level element or character node.

!!! Note
    Oracle does not support the storage of content fragments in `XMLTYPE` columns.

The following example shows the creation and insertion of a row into a table with an `XMLTYPE` column.

```text
CREATE TABLE books (
    content         XMLTYPE
);

INSERT INTO books VALUES (XMLPARSE (DOCUMENT '<?xml
version="1.0"?><book><title>Manual</title><chapter>...</chapter></book>'));

SELECT * FROM books;

                         content
----------------------------------------------------------
 <book><title>Manual</title><chapter>...</chapter></book>
(1 row)
```
