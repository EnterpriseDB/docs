This section describes Advanced Serverâ€™s functions for operating on sequence objects. Sequence objects (also called sequence generators or just sequences) are special single-row tables created with the `CREATE SEQUENCE` command. A sequence object is usually used to generate unique identifiers for rows of a table. The sequence functions, listed below, provide simple, multiuser-safe methods for obtaining successive sequence values from sequence objects.

```text
sequence.NEXTVAL
sequence.CURRVAL
```

`sequence` is the identifier assigned to the sequence in the `CREATE SEQUENCE` command. The following describes the usage of these functions.

`NEXTVAL`

 Advance the sequence object to its next value and return that value. This is done atomically: even if multiple sessions execute `NEXTVAL` concurrently, each will safely receive a distinct sequence value.

`CURRVAL`

 Return the value most recently obtained by `NEXTVAL` for this sequence in the current session. (An error is reported if `NEXTVAL` has never been called for this sequence in this session.) Notice that because this is returning a session-local value, it gives a predictable answer whether or not other sessions have executed `NEXTVAL` since the current session did.

If a sequence object has been created with default parameters, `NEXTVAL` calls on it will return successive values beginning with 1. Other behaviors can be obtained by using special parameters in the `CREATE SEQUENCE` command.

**Important**: To avoid blocking of concurrent transactions that obtain numbers from the same sequence, a `NEXTVAL` operation is never rolled back; that is, once a value has been fetched it is considered used, even if the transaction that did the `NEXTVAL` later aborts. This means that aborted transactions may leave unused "holes" in the sequence of assigned values.
