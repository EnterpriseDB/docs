The following section describes the SQL-compliant conditional expressions available in Advanced Server.

## CASE

The SQL `CASE` expression is a generic conditional expression, similar to if/else statements in other languages:

```text
CASE WHEN condition THEN result
   [ WHEN ... ]
   [ ELSE result ]
END
```

`CASE` clauses can be used wherever an expression is valid. `condition` is an expression that returns a `BOOLEAN` result. If the result is `TRUE` then the value of the `CASE` expression is the `result` that follows the condition. If the result is `FALSE` any subsequent `WHEN` clauses are searched in the same manner. If `no WHEN condition` is `TRUE` then the value of the `CASE` expression is the `result` in the `ELSE` clause. If the `ELSE` clause is omitted and no condition matches, the result is `NULL`.

An example:

```text
SELECT * FROM test;

 a
---
 1
 2
 3
(3 rows)

SELECT a,
    CASE WHEN a=1 THEN 'one'
         WHEN a=2 THEN 'two'
         ELSE 'other'
    END
FROM test;

 a | case
---+-------
 1 | one
 2 | two
 3 | other
(3 rows)
```

The data types of all the `result` expressions must be convertible to a single output type.

The following “simple” `CASE` expression is a specialized variant of the general form above:

```text
CASE expression
    WHEN value THEN result
  [ WHEN ... ]
  [ ELSE result ]
END
```

The `expression` is computed and compared to all the `value` specifications in the `WHEN` clauses until one is found that is equal. If no match is found, the `result` in the `ELSE` clause (or a null value) is returned.

The example above can be written using the simple `CASE` syntax:

```text
SELECT a,
    CASE a WHEN 1 THEN 'one'
           WHEN 2 THEN 'two'
           ELSE 'other'
    END
FROM test;

 a | case
---+-------
 1 | one
 2 | two
 3 | other
(3 rows)
```

A `CASE` expression does not evaluate any subexpressions that are not needed to determine the result. For example, this is a possible way of avoiding a division-by-zero failure:

```
SELECT ... WHERE CASE WHEN x <> 0 THEN y/x > 1.5 ELSE false END;
```

## COALESCE

The `COALESCE` function returns the first of its arguments that is not null. Null is returned only if all arguments are null.

```text
COALESCE(value [, value2 ] ... )
```

It is often used to substitute a default value for null values when data is retrieved for display or further computation. For example:

```
SELECT COALESCE(description, short_description, '(none)') ...
```

Like a `CASE` expression, `COALESCE` will not evaluate arguments that are not needed to determine the result; that is, arguments to the right of the first non-null argument are not evaluated. This SQL-standard function provides capabilities similar to `NVL` and `IFNULL`, which are used in some other database systems.

## NULLIF

The `NULLIF` function returns a null value if `value1` and `value2` are equal; otherwise it returns `value1`.

```text
NULLIF(value1, value2)
```

This can be used to perform the inverse operation of the `COALESCE` example given above:

```
SELECT NULLIF(value1, '(none)') ...
```

If `value1` is (none), return a null, otherwise return `value1`.

## NVL

The `NVL` function returns the first of its arguments that is not null. `NVL` evaluates the first expression; if that expression evaluates to `NULL`, `NVL` returns the second expression.

```text
NVL(expr1, expr2)
```

The return type is the same as the argument types; all arguments must have the same data type (or be coercible to a common type). `NVL` returns `NULL` if all arguments are `NULL`.

The following example computes a bonus for non-commissioned employees, If an employee is a commissioned employee, this expression returns the employees commission; if the employee is not a commissioned employee (that is, his commission is `NULL`), this expression returns a bonus that is 10% of his salary.

```text
bonus = NVL(emp.commission, emp.salary * .10)
```

## NVL2

`NVL2` evaluates an expression, and returns either the second or third expression, depending on the value of the first expression. If the first expression is not `NULL`, `NVL2` returns the value in `expr2`; if the first expression is `NULL`, `NVL2` returns the value in `expr3`.

```text
NVL2(expr1, expr2, expr3)
```

The return type is the same as the argument types; all arguments must have the same data type (or be coercible to a common type).

The following example computes a bonus for commissioned employees - if a given employee is a commissioned employee, this expression returns an amount equal to 110% of his commission; if the employee is not a commissioned employee (that is, his commission is `NULL`), this expression returns `0`.

```text
bonus = NVL2(emp.commission, emp.commission * 1.1, 0)
```

## GREATEST and LEAST

The `GREATEST` and `LEAST` functions select the largest or smallest value from a list of any number of expressions.

```text
GREATEST(value [, value2 ] ... )
LEAST(value [, value2 ] ... )
```

The expressions must all be convertible to a common data type, which will be the type of the result. Null values in the list are ignored. The result will be null only if all the expressions evaluate to null.

!!! Note
    The `GREATEST` and `LEAST` are not in the SQL standard, but are a common extension.
