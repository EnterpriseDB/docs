<div id="comparison_operators" class="registered_link"></div>

The usual comparison operators are shown in the following table:

| Operator | Description              |
| -------- | ------------------------ |
| `<`      | Less than                |
| `>`      | Greater than             |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal to    |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal to |
| `=`      | Equal                    |
| `<>`     | Not equal                |
| `!=`     | Not equal                |

Comparison operators are available for all data types where this makes sense. All comparison operators are binary operators that return values of type `BOOLEAN;` expressions like `1 < 2 < 3` are not valid (because there is no `<` operator to compare a Boolean value with `3`).

In addition to the comparison operators, the special `BETWEEN` construct is available.

 `a BETWEEN x AND y`

is equivalent to

 `a >= x AND a <= y`

Similarly,

 `a NOT BETWEEN x AND y`

is equivalent to

 `a < x OR a > y`

There is no difference between the two respective forms apart from the CPU cycles required to rewrite the first one into the second one internally.

To check whether a value is or is not null, use the constructs

 `expression IS NULL`

 `expression IS NOT NULL`

Do not write `expression = NULL` because `NULL` is not "equal to" `NULL`. (The null value represents an unknown value, and it is not known whether two unknown values are equal.) This behavior conforms to the SQL standard.

Some applications may expect that `expression = NULL` returns true if `expression` evaluates to the null value. It is highly recommended that these applications be modified to comply with the SQL standard.
