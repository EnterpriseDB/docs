The following sections describe the subset of the Advanced Server SQL language compatible with Oracle databases. The following SQL syntax, data types, and functions work in both EDB Postgres Advanced Server and Oracle.

The Advanced Server documentation set includes syntax and commands for extended functionality (functionality that does not provide database compatibility for Oracle or support Oracle-styled applications) that is not included in this guide.

This section is organized into the following sections:

-   General discussion of Advanced Server SQL syntax and language elements
-   Data types
-   Built-in functions
