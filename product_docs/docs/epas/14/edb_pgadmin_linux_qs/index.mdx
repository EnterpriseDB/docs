pgAdmin 4 is the leading Open Source management tool for Postgres databases. EDB pgAdmin 4 is distributed by EDB along with EDB Postgres Advanced Server databases. It is designed to meet the needs of both novice and experienced Postgres users alike, providing a powerful graphical interface that simplifies the creation, maintenance and use of database objects.

You can install `EDB pgAdmin 4` for your Advanced Server databases using yum package manager for RHEL/CentOS 7.x or 8.x platforms.

**Installing EDB pgAdmin 4 on a Linux Host**

You can use the following steps to use the yum package manager to install EDB pgAdmin4:

**Create a Repository Configuration File**

To create a repository configuration file, you must have the credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

<https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf>.

To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

```text
yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d.` After creating the `edb.repo` file, use the following command to replace the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` placeholders in the baseurl specification with the username and password of a registered EDB user:

```text
sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
```

!!! Note
    If you have `edb.repo` already configured then you can skip this step and go to the next step.

**Install EPEL Repository**

For CentOS 7.x use the following command:

```text
yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
```

!!! Note
    To install EPEL repository on CentOS/RHEL 7.x and 8.x see the platform specific steps at [EDB Website](https://repos.enterprisedb.com/).

**Install EDB pgAdmin 4**

After creating the repository configuration file and adding a username and password to the `edb.repo` file, you can install `edb-pgadmin4`. To install `edb-pgadmin4`, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

```text
yum install edb-pgadmin4*
```

!!! Note
     This command will install following packages:

     `edb-pgadmin4`

     `edb-pgadmin4-desktop-common`

     `edb-pgadmin4-desktop-gnome`

     `edb-pgadmin4-docs`

     `edb-pgadmin4-web`
