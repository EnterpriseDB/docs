EDB has enhanced ECPG (the PostgreSQL pre-compiler) to create ECPGPlus. ECPGPlus is a Pro\*C-compatible version of the PostgreSQL C pre-compiler. ECPGPlus translates a program that combines C code and embedded SQL statements into an equivalent C program. As it performs the translation, ECPGPlus verifies that the syntax of each SQL construct is correct.

The following diagram charts the path of a program containing embedded SQL statements as it is compiled into an executable:

![Compilation of a program containing embedded SQL statements](images/ecpg_path.png)

Compilation of a program containing embedded SQL statements

To produce an executable from a C program that contains embedded SQL statements, pass the program (`my_program.pgc` in the diagram above) to the ECPGPlus pre-compiler. ECPGPlus translates each SQL statement in `my_program.pgc` into C code that calls the `ecpglib` API, and produces a C program (`my_program.c`). Then, pass the C program to a C compiler; the C compiler generates an object file (`my_program.o`). Finally, pass the object file (`my_program.o`), as well as the `ecpglib` library file, and any other required libraries to the linker, which in turn produces the executable (`my_program`).

While the ECPGPlus preprocessor validates the *syntax* of each SQL statement, it cannot validate the *semantics*. For example, the preprocessor will confirm that an `INSERT` statement is syntactically correct, but it cannot confirm that the table mentioned in the `INSERT` statement actually exists.

## Behind the scenes

A client application contains a mix of C code and SQL code comprised of the following elements:

-   C preprocessor directives
-   C declarations (variables, types, functions, ...)
-   C definitions (variables, types, functions, ...)
-   SQL preprocessor directives
-   SQL statements

For example:

```text
1 #include <stdio.h>
2 EXEC SQL INCLUDE sqlca;
3
4 extern void printInt(char *label, int val);
5 extern void printStr(char *label, char *val);
6 extern void printFloat(char *label, float val);
7
8 void displayCustomer(int custNumber)
9 {
10  EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
11    VARCHAR custName[50];
12    float custBalance;
13    int custID = custNumber;
14  EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;
15
16  EXEC SQL SELECT name, balance
17    INTO :custName, :custBalance
18    FROM customer
19    WHERE id = :custID;
20
21  printInt("ID", custID);
22  printStr("Name", custName);
23  printFloat("Balance", custBalance);
24 }
```

In the above code fragment:

-   Line 1 specifies a directive to the C preprocessor.

    C preprocessor directives may be interpreted or ignored; the option is controlled by a command line option (`-C PROC`) entered when you invoke ECPGPlus. In either case, ECPGPlus copies each C preprocessor directive to the output file (4) without change; any C preprocessor directive found in the source file will appear in the output file.

-   Line 2 specifies a directive to the SQL preprocessor.

    SQL preprocessor directives are interpreted by the ECPGPlus preprocessor, and are not copied to the output file.

-   Lines 4 through 6 contain C declarations.

    C declarations are copied to the output file without change, except that each `VARCHAR` declaration is translated into an equivalent `struct` declaration.

-   Lines 10 through 14 contain an embedded-SQL declaration section.  

    C variables that you refer to within SQL code are known as `host  variables`. If you invoke the ECPGPlus preprocessor in Pro\*C mode (`-C PROC`), you may refer to *any* C variable within a SQL statement; otherwise you must declare each host variable within a `BEGIN/END DECLARATION SECTION` pair.

-   Lines 16 through 19 contain a SQL statement.

    SQL statements are translated into calls to the ECPGPlus run-time library.

-   Lines 21 through 23 contain C code.

    C code is copied to the output file without change.

Any SQL statement must be prefixed with `EXEC SQL` and extends to the next (unquoted) semicolon. For example:

```text
printf(“Updating employee salaries\n”);

EXEC SQL UPDATE emp SET sal = sal * 1.25;
EXEC SQL COMMIT;

printf(“Employee salaries updated\n”);
```

When the preprocessor encounters the code fragment shown above, it passes the C code (the first line and the last line) to the output file without translation and converts each `EXEC SQL` statement into a call to an `ecpglib` function. The result would appear similar to the following:

```text
printf("Updating employee salaries\n");

{
  ECPGdo( __LINE__, 0, 1, NULL, 0, ECPGst_normal,
         "update emp set sal = sal * 1.25",
         ECPGt_EOIT, ECPGt_EORT);
}

{
  ECPGtrans(__LINE__, NULL, "commit");
}

printf(“Employee salaries updated\n”);
```

## Installation and configuration

On Windows, ECPGPlus is installed by the Advanced Server installation wizard as part of the `Database Server` component. On Linux, install with the `edb-asxx-server-devel` RPM package where `xx` is the Advanced Server version number. By default, the executable is located in:

On Windows:

```text
C:\Program Files\edb\as14\bin
```

On Linux:

```text
/usr/edb/as14/bin
```

When invoking the ECPGPlus compiler, the executable must be in your search path (`%PATH%` on Windows, `$PATH` on Linux). For example, the following commands set the search path to include the directory that holds the ECPGPlus executable file `ecpg`.

On Windows:

```text
set EDB_PATH=C:\Program Files\edb\as14\bin
set PATH=%EDB_PATH%;%PATH%
```

On Linux:

```text
export EDB_PATH==/usr/edb/as14/bin
export PATH=$EDB_PATH:$PATH
```

## Constructing a makefile

A `makefile` contains a set of instructions that tell the `make` utility how to transform a program written in C (that contains embedded SQL) into a C program. To try the examples in this guide, you will need:

-   a C compiler (and linker)
-   the `make` utility
-   ECPGPlus preprocessor and library
-   a `makefile` that contains instructions for ECPGPlus

The following code is an example of a `makefile` for the samples included in this guide. To use the sample code, save it in a file named `makefile` in the directory that contains the source code file.

```text
INCLUDES = -I$(shell pg_config --includedir)
LIBPATH = -L $(shell pg_config --libdir)
CFLAGS += $(INCLUDES) -g
LDFLAGS += -g
LDLIBS += $(LIBPATH) -lecpg -lpq

.SUFFIXES: .pgc,.pc

.pgc.c:
     ecpg -c $(INCLUDES) $?

.pc.c:
     ecpg -C PROC -c $(INCLUDES) $?
```

The first two lines use the `pg_config` program to locate the necessary header files and library directories:

```text
INCLUDES = -I$(shell pg_config --includedir)
LIBPATH = -L $(shell pg_config --libdir)
```

The `pg_config` program is shipped with Advanced Server.

`make` knows that it should use the `CFLAGS` variable when running the C compiler and `LDFLAGS` and `LDLIBS` when invoking the linker. ECPG programs must be linked against the ECPG run-time library (`-lecpg`) and the libpq library (`-lpq`)

```text
CFLAGS += $(INCLUDES) -g
LDFLAGS += -g
LDLIBS += $(LIBPATH) -lecpg -lpq
```

The sample `makefile` instructs make how to translate a `.pgc` or a `.pc` file into a C program. Two lines in the `makefile` specify the mode in which the source file will be compiled. The first compile option is:

```text
.pgc.c:
      ecpg -c $(INCLUDES) $?
```

The first option tells `make` how to transform a file that ends in `.pgc` (presumably, an ECPG source file) into a file that ends in `.c` (a C program), using community ECPG (without the ECPGPlus enhancements). It invokes the ECPG pre-compiler with the `-c` flag (instructing the compiler to convert SQL code into C), using the value of the `INCLUDES` variable and the name of the `.pgc` file.

```text
.pc.c:
    ecpg -C PROC -c $(INCLUDES) $?
```

The second option tells `make` how to transform a file that ends in `.pg` (an ECPG source file) into a file that ends in `.c` (a C program), using the ECPGPlus extensions. It invokes the ECPG pre-compiler with the `-c` flag (instructing the compiler to convert SQL code into C), as well as the `-C PROC` flag (instructing the compiler to use ECPGPlus in Pro\*C-compatibility mode), using the value of the `INCLUDES` variable and the name of the `.pgc` file.

When you run `make`, pass the name of the ECPG source code file you wish to compile. For example, to compile an ECPG source code file named `customer_list.pgc`, use the command:

```text
make customer_list
```

The `make` utility consults the `makefile` (located in the current directory), discovers that the `makefile` contains a rule that will compile `customer_list.pgc` into a C program (`customer_list.c`), and then uses the rules built into `make` to compile `customer_list.c` into an executable program.

## ECPGPlus command line options

In the sample `makefile` shown above, `make` includes the `-C` option when invoking ECPGPlus to specify that ECPGPlus should be invoked in Pro\*C compatible mode.

If you include the `-C` `PROC` keywords on the command line, in addition to the ECPG syntax, you may use Pro\*C command line syntax; for example:

```text
$ ecpg -C PROC INCLUDE=/usr/edb/as14/include acct_update.c
```

To display a complete list of the other ECPGPlus options available, navigate to the ECPGPlus installation directory, and enter:

```text
./ecpg --help
```

The command line options are:

!!! Note
    If you do not specify an output file name when invoking ECPGPlus, the output file name is created by stripping off the `.pgc` filename extension, and appending `.c` to the file name.
