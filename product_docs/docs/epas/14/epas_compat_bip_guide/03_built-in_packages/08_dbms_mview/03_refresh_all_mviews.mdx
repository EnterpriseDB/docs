title: "REFRESH_ALL_MVIEWS"
---

Use the `REFRESH_ALL_MVIEWS` procedure to refresh any materialized views that have not been refreshed since the table or view on which the view depends has been modified. The signature is:

```text
REFRESH_ALL_MVIEWS(
  <number_of_failures> OUT BINARY_INTEGER,
  <method> IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL,
  <rollback_seg> IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL,
  <refresh_after_errors> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  <atomic_refresh> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE);
```

## Parameters

`number_of_failures`

 `number_of_failures` is a `BINARY_INTEGER` that specifies the number of failures that occurred during the refresh operation.

`method`

 `method` is a `VARCHAR2` value that specifies the refresh method that will be applied to the specified view (or views). The only supported method is `C;` this performs a complete refresh of the view.

`rollback_seg`

 `rollback_seg` is accepted for compatibility and ignored. The default is `NULL`.

`refresh_after_errors`

 `refresh_after_errors` is accepted for compatibility and ignored. The default is `FALSE`.

`atomic_refresh`

 `atomic_refresh` is accepted for compatibility and ignored. The default is `TRUE`.

## Examples

The following example performs a `COMPLETE` refresh on all materialized views:

```text
DECLARE
  errors INTEGER;
BEGIN
  DBMS_MVIEW.REFRESH_ALL_MVIEWS(errors, method => 'C');
END;
```

Upon completion, `errors` contains the number of failures.
