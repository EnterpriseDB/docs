title: "SUBMIT"
---

The `SUBMIT` procedure creates a job definition and stores it in the database. A job consists of a job identifier, the stored procedure to be executed, when the job is to be first run, and a date function that calculates the next date/time the job is to be run.

```text
SUBMIT(<job> OUT BINARY_INTEGER, <what> VARCHAR2
  [, <next_date> DATE [, <interval> VARCHAR2 [, <no_parse> BOOLEAN ]]])
```

## Parameters

`job`

 Identifier assigned to the job.

`what`

 Name of the stored procedure to be executed by the job.

`next_date`

 Date/time when the job is to be run next. The default is `SYSDATE`.

`interval`

 Date function that when evaluated, provides the next date/time the job is to run. If `interval` is set to null, then the job is run only once. Null is the default.

`no_parse`

 If set to `TRUE`, do not syntax-check the stored procedure upon job creation – check only when the job first executes. If set to `FALSE`, check the procedure upon job creation. The default is `FALSE`.

!!! Note 
    The `no_parse` option is not supported in this implementation of `SUBMIT()`. It is included for compatibility only.

## Examples

The following example creates a job using stored procedure, `job_proc`. The job will execute immediately and run once a day thereafter as set by the `interval` parameter, `SYSDATE + 1`.

```text
DECLARE
    jobid INTEGER;
BEGIN
    DBMS_JOB.SUBMIT(jobid,'job_proc;',SYSDATE,
        'SYSDATE + 1');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('jobid: ' || jobid);
END;

jobid: 104
```

The job immediately executes procedure, `job_proc`, populating table, `jobrun`, with a row:

```text
SELECT * FROM jobrun;

            runtime
-------------------------------------
 job_proc run at 2007-12-11 11:43:25
(1 row)
```
