The `BROKEN` procedure sets the state of a job to either broken or not broken. A broken job cannot be executed except by using the `RUN` procedure.

```text
BROKEN(<job> BINARY_INTEGER, <broken> BOOLEAN [, <next_date> DATE ])
```

## Parameters

`job`

 Identifier of the job to be set as broken or not broken.

`broken`

 If set to `TRUE` the job’s state is set to broken. If set to `FALSE` the job’s state is set to not broken. Broken jobs cannot be run except by using the `RUN` procedure.

`next_date`

 Date/time when the job is to be run. The default is `SYSDATE`.

## Examples

Set the state of a job with job identifier 104 to broken:

```text
BEGIN
    DBMS_JOB.BROKEN(104,true);
END;
```

Change the state back to not broken:

```text
BEGIN
    DBMS_JOB.BROKEN(104,false);
END;
```
