Use the `DROP_JOB` procedure to `DROP` a job, `DROP` any arguments that belong to the job, and eliminate any future job executions. The signature of the procedure is:

```text
DROP_JOB(
  <job_name> IN VARCHAR2,
  <force> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  <defer> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  <commit_semantics> IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT 'STOP_ON_FIRST_ERROR')
```

## Parameters

`job_name`

 `job_name` specifies the name of the job that is being dropped.

`force`

 `force` is accepted for compatibility, and ignored.

`defer`

 `defer` is accepted for compatibility, and ignored.

`commit_semantics`

 `commit_semantics` instructs the server how to handle an error encountered while dropping a program or job. By default, `commit_semantics` is set to `STOP_ON_FIRST_ERROR`, instructing the server to stop when it encounters an error.

 The `TRANSACTIONAL` and `ABSORB_ERRORS` keywords are accepted for compatibility, and ignored.

## Example

The following call to `DROP_JOB` drops a job named `update_log`:

```text
DBMS_SCHEDULER.DROP_JOB('update_log');
```
