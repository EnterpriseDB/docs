title: "RUN_JOB"
---

Use the `RUN_JOB` procedure to execute a job immediately. The signature of the `RUN_JOB` procedure is:

```text
RUN_JOB(
  <job_name> IN VARCHAR2,
  <use_current_session> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE
```

## Parameters

`job_name`

 `job_name` specifies the name of the job that will execute.

`use_current_session`

 By default, the job will execute in the current session. If specified, `use_current_session` must be set to `TRUE` ; if `use_current_session` is set to `FALSE`, Advanced Server will return an error.

## Example

The following call to `RUN_JOB` executes a job named `update_log`:

```text
DBMS_SCHEDULER.RUN_JOB('update_log', TRUE);
```

Passing a value of `TRUE` as the second argument instructs the server to invoke the job in the current session.
