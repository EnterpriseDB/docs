<div id="dbms_scheduler_disable" class="registered_link"></div>

Use the `DISABLE` procedure to disable a program or a job. The signature of the `DISABLE` procedure is:

```text
DISABLE(
  <name> IN VARCHAR2,
  <force> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  <commit_semantics> IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT 'STOP_ON_FIRST_ERROR')
```

## Parameters

`name`

 `name` specifies the name of the program or job that is being disabled.

`force`

 `force` is accepted for compatibility, and ignored.

`commit_semantics`

 `commit_semantics` instructs the server how to handle an error encountered while disabling a program or job. By default, `commit_semantics` is set to `STOP_ON_FIRST_ERROR`, instructing the server to stop when it encounters an error. Any programs or jobs that were successfully disabled prior to the error will be committed to disk.

 The `TRANSACTIONAL` and `ABSORB_ERRORS` keywords are accepted for compatibility, and ignored.

## Example

The following call to the `DISABLE` procedure disables a program named `update_emp`:

```text
DBMS_SCHEDULER.DISABLE('update_emp');
```
