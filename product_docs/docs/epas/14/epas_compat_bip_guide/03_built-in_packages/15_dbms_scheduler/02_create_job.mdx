title: "CREATE_JOB"
---

Use the `CREATE_JOB` procedure to create a job. The procedure comes in two forms; the first form of the procedure specifies a schedule within the job definition, as well as a job action that will be invoked when the job executes:

```text
CREATE_JOB(
  <job_name> IN VARCHAR2,
  <job_type> IN VARCHAR2,
  <job_action> IN VARCHAR2,
  <number_of_arguments> IN PLS_INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
  <start_date> IN TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NULL,
  <repeat_interval> IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL,
  <end_date> IN TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NULL,
  <job_class> IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT 'DEFAULT_JOB_CLASS',
  <enabled> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  <auto_drop> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  <comments> IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL)
```

The second form uses a job schedule to specify the schedule on which the job will execute, and specifies the name of a program that will execute when the job runs:

```text
CREATE_JOB(
  <job_name> IN VARCHAR2,
  <program_name> IN VARCHAR2,
  <schedule_name> IN VARCHAR2,
  <job_class> IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT 'DEFAULT_JOB_CLASS',
  <enabled> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  <auto_drop> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
  <comments> IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL)
```

## Parameters

`job_name`

 `job_name` specifies the optionally schema-qualified name of the job being created.

`job_type`

 `job_type` specifies the type of job. The current implementation of `CREATE_JOB` supports a job type of `PLSQL_BLOCK` or `STORED_PROCEDURE`.

`job_action`

-   If `job_type` is `PLSQL_BLOCK`, `job_action` specifies the content of the PL/SQL block that will be invoked when the job executes. The block must be terminated with a semi-colon (;).

-   If `job_type` is `STORED_PROCEDURE`, `job_action` specifies the optionally schema-qualified name of the procedure.

`number_of_arguments`

 `number_of_arguments` is an `INTEGER` value that specifies the number of arguments expected by the job. The default is `0`.

`start_date`

 `start_date` is a `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` value that specifies the first time that the job is scheduled to execute. The default value is `NULL`, indicating that the job should be scheduled to execute when the job is enabled.

`repeat_interval`

 `repeat_interval` is a `VARCHAR2` value that specifies how often the job will repeat. If a `repeat_interval` is not specified, the job will execute only once. The default value is `NULL`.

`end_date`

 `end_date` is a `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` value that specifies a time after which the job will no longer execute. If a date is specified, the `end_date` must be after `start_date`. The default value is `NULL`.

 Please note that if an `end_date` is not specified and a `repeat_interval` is specified, the job will repeat indefinitely until it is disabled.

`program_name`

 `program_name` is the name of a program that will be executed by the job.

`schedule_name`

 `schedule_name` is the name of the schedule associated with the job.

`job_class`

 `job_class` is accepted for compatibility and ignored.

`enabled`

 `enabled` is a `BOOLEAN` value that specifies if the job is enabled when created. By default, a job is created in a disabled state, with `enabled` set to `FALSE`. To enable a job, specify a value of `TRUE` when creating the job, or enable the job with the `DBMS_SCHEDULER.ENABLE` procedure.

`auto_drop`

 The `auto_drop` parameter is accepted for compatibility and is ignored. By default, a job's status will be changed to `DISABLED` after the time specified in `end_date`.

`comments`

 Use the `comments` parameter to specify a comment about the job.

## Example

The following example demonstrates a call to the `CREATE_JOB` procedure:

```text
EXEC
  DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_JOB (
    job_name        => 'update_log',
    job_type        => 'PLSQL_BLOCK',
    job_action      => 'BEGIN INSERT INTO my_log VALUES(current_timestamp);
                        END;',
    start_date      => '01-JUN-15 09:00:00.000000',
    repeat_interval => 'FREQ=DAILY;BYDAY=MON,TUE,WED,THU,FRI;BYHOUR=17;',
    end_date        => NULL,
    enabled         => TRUE,
    comments        => 'This job adds a row to the my_log table.');
```

The code fragment creates a job named `update_log` that executes each weeknight at 5:00. The job executes a PL/SQL block that inserts the current timestamp into a logfile (`my_log`). Since no `end_date` is specified, the job will execute until it is disabled by the `DBMS_SCHEDULER.DISABLE` procedure.
