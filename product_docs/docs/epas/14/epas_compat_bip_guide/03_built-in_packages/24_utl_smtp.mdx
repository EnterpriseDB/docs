Advanced Server's implementation of `UTL_SMTP` is a partial implementation when compared to Oracle's version. Only those functions and procedures listed in the table above are supported.

The following table lists the public variables available in the `UTL_SMTP` package.

| Public Variables | Data Type | Value | Description                        |
| ---------------- | --------- | ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| `connection`     | `RECORD`  |       | Description of an SMTP connection. |
| `reply`          | `RECORD`  |       | SMTP reply line.                   |

## CONNECTION

The `CONNECTION` record type provides a description of an SMTP connection.

```text
TYPE connection IS RECORD (
    host            VARCHAR2(255),
    port            PLS_INTEGER,
    tx_timeout      PLS_INTEGER
);
```

<div id="reply_replies" class="registered_link"></div>

## REPLY/REPLIES

The `REPLY` record type provides a description of an SMTP reply line. `REPLIES` is a table of multiple SMTP reply lines.

```text
TYPE reply IS RECORD (
    code            INTEGER,
    text            VARCHAR2(508)
);
TYPE replies IS TABLE OF reply INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;
```

## CLOSE_DATA

The `CLOSE_DATA` procedure terminates an e-mail message by sending the following sequence:

`<CR><LF>.<CR><LF>`

This is a single period at the beginning of a line.

```text
CLOSE_DATA(<c> IN OUT CONNECTION)
```

### Parameters

`c`

 The SMTP connection to be closed.

## COMMAND

The `COMMAND` procedure provides the capability to execute an SMTP command. If you are expecting multiple reply lines, use `COMMAND_REPLIES`.

```text
<reply> REPLY COMMAND(<c> IN OUT CONNECTION, <cmd> VARCHAR2
   [, <arg> VARCHAR2 ])

COMMAND(<c> IN OUT CONNECTION, <cmd> VARCHAR2 [, <arg> VARCHAR2 ])
```

### Parameters

`c`

 The SMTP connection to which the command is to be sent.

`cmd`

 The SMTP command to be processed.

`arg`

 An argument to the SMTP command. The default is null.

`reply`

 SMTP reply to the command. If SMTP returns multiple replies, only the last one is returned in `reply`.

 See [Reply/Replies](#replyreplies) for a description of `REPLY` and `REPLIES`.

## COMMAND_REPLIES

The `COMMAND_REPLIES` function processes an SMTP command that returns multiple reply lines. Use `COMMAND` if only a single reply line is expected.

```text
<replies> REPLIES COMMAND(<c> IN OUT CONNECTION, <cmd> VARCHAR2
   [, <arg> VARCHAR2 ])
```

### Parameters

`c`

 The SMTP connection to which the command is to be sent.

`cmd`

 The SMTP command to be processed.

`arg`

 An argument to the SMTP command. The default is null.

`replies`

 SMTP reply lines to the command. See [Reply/Replies](#replyreplies) for a description of `REPLY` and `REPLIES`.

## DATA

The `DATA` procedure provides the capability to specify the body of the e-mail message. The message is terminated with a `<CR><LF>.<CR><LF>` sequence.

```text
DATA(<c> IN OUT CONNECTION, <body> VARCHAR2)
```

### Parameters

`c`

 The SMTP connection to which the command is to be sent.

`body`

 Body of the e-mail message to be sent.

## EHLO

The `EHLO` procedure performs initial handshaking with the SMTP server after establishing the connection. The `EHLO` procedure allows the client to identify itself to the SMTP server according to RFC 821. RFC 1869 specifies the format of the information returned in the server’s reply. The `HELO` procedure performs the equivalent functionality, but returns less information about the server.

```text
EHLO(<c> IN OUT CONNECTION, <domain> VARCHAR2)
```

### Parameters

`c`

 The connection to the SMTP server over which to perform handshaking.

`domain`

 Domain name of the sending host.

## HELO

The `HELO` procedure performs initial handshaking with the SMTP server after establishing the connection. The `HELO` procedure allows the client to identify itself to the SMTP server according to RFC 821. The `EHLO` procedure performs the equivalent functionality, but returns more information about the server.

```text
HELO(<c> IN OUT, <domain> VARCHAR2)
```

### Parameters

`c`

 The connection to the SMTP server over which to perform handshaking.

`domain`

 Domain name of the sending host.

## HELP

The `HELP` function provides the capability to send the `HELP` command to the SMTP server.

```text
<replies> REPLIES HELP(<c> IN OUT CONNECTION [, <command> VARCHAR2 ])
```

### Parameters

`c`

 The SMTP connection to which the command is to be sent.

`command`

 Command on which help is requested.

`replies`

 SMTP reply lines to the command. See [Reply/Replies](#replyreplies) for a description of `REPLY` and `REPLIES`.

## MAIL

The `MAIL` procedure initiates a mail transaction.

```text
MAIL(<c> IN OUT CONNECTION, <sender> VARCHAR2 [, <parameters> VARCHAR2 ])
```

### Parameters

`c`

 Connection to SMTP server on which to start a mail transaction.

`sender`

 The sender’s e-mail address.

`parameters`

 Mail command parameters in the format, `key=value` as defined in RFC 1869.

## NOOP

The `NOOP` function/procedure sends the null command to the SMTP server. The `NOOP` has no effect upon the server except to obtain a successful response.

```text
<reply> REPLY NOOP(<c> IN OUT CONNECTION)

NOOP(<c> IN OUT CONNECTION)
```

### Parameters

`c`

 The SMTP connection on which to send the command.

`reply`

 SMTP reply to the command. If SMTP returns multiple replies, only the last one is returned in `reply`. See [Reply/Replies](#replyreplies) for a description of `REPLY` and `REPLIES`.

## OPEN_CONNECTION

The `OPEN_CONNECTION` functions open a connection to an SMTP server.

```text
<c> CONNECTION OPEN_CONNECTION(<host> VARCHAR2 [, <port>
PLS_INTEGER [, <tx_timeout> PLS_INTEGER DEFAULT NULL]])
```

### Parameters

`host`

 Name of the SMTP server.

`port`

 Port number on which the SMTP server is listening. The default is 25.

`tx_timeout`

 Time out value in seconds. Do not wait is indicated by specifying 0. Wait indefinitely is indicated by setting timeout to null. The default is null.

`c`

 Connection handle returned by the SMTP server.

## OPEN_DATA

The `OPEN_DATA` procedure sends the `DATA` command to the SMTP server.

```text
OPEN_DATA(<c> IN OUT CONNECTION)
```

### Parameters

`c`

 SMTP connection on which to send the command.

## QUIT

The `QUIT` procedure closes the session with an SMTP server.

```text
QUIT(<c> IN OUT CONNECTION)
```

### Parameters

`c`

 SMTP connection to be terminated.

## RCPT

The `RCPT` procedure provides the e-mail address of the recipient. To schedule multiple recipients, invoke `RCPT` multiple times.

```text
RCPT(<c> IN OUT CONNECTION, <recipient> VARCHAR2 [, <parameters> VARCHAR2 ])
```

### Parameters

`c`

 Connection to SMTP server on which to add a recipient.

`recipient`

 The recipient’s e-mail address.

`parameters`

 Mail command parameters in the format, key=value as defined in RFC 1869.

## RSET

The `RSET` procedure provides the capability to terminate the current mail transaction.

The `WRITE_DATA` procedure provides the capability to add `VARCHAR2` data to an e-mail message. The `WRITE_DATA` procedure may be repetitively called to add data.

```text
WRITE_DATA(<c> IN OUT CONNECTION, <data> VARCHAR2)
```

### Parameters

`c`

 The SMTP connection on which to add data.

`data`

 Data to be added to the e-mail message. The data must conform to the RFC 822 specification.

## Comprehensive example

The following procedure constructs and sends a text e-mail message using the `UTL_SMTP` package.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE send_mail (
    p_sender        VARCHAR2,
    p_recipient     VARCHAR2,
    p_subj          VARCHAR2,
    p_msg           VARCHAR2,
    p_mailhost      VARCHAR2
)
IS
    v_conn          UTL_SMTP.CONNECTION;
    v_crlf          CONSTANT VARCHAR2(2) := CHR(13) || CHR(10);
    v_port          CONSTANT PLS_INTEGER := 25;
BEGIN
    v_conn := UTL_SMTP.OPEN_CONNECTION(p_mailhost,v_port);
    UTL_SMTP.HELO(v_conn,p_mailhost);
    UTL_SMTP.MAIL(v_conn,p_sender);
    UTL_SMTP.RCPT(v_conn,p_recipient);
    UTL_SMTP.DATA(v_conn, SUBSTR(
        'Date: ' || TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,
        'Dy, DD Mon YYYY HH24:MI:SS') || v_crlf
        || 'From: ' || p_sender || v_crlf
        || 'To: ' || p_recipient || v_crlf
        || 'Subject: ' || p_subj || v_crlf
        || p_msg
        , 1, 32767));
    UTL_SMTP.QUIT(v_conn);
END;

EXEC send_mail('asmith@enterprisedb.com','pjones@enterprisedb.com','Holiday
Party','Are you planning to attend?','smtp.enterprisedb.com');
```

The following example uses the `OPEN_DATA, WRITE_DATA`, and `CLOSE_DATA` procedures instead of the `DATA` procedure.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE send_mail_2 (
    p_sender        VARCHAR2,
    p_recipient     VARCHAR2,
    p_subj          VARCHAR2,
    p_msg           VARCHAR2,
    p_mailhost      VARCHAR2
)
IS
    v_conn          UTL_SMTP.CONNECTION;
    v_crlf          CONSTANT VARCHAR2(2) := CHR(13) || CHR(10);
    v_port          CONSTANT PLS_INTEGER := 25;
BEGIN
    v_conn := UTL_SMTP.OPEN_CONNECTION(p_mailhost,v_port);
    UTL_SMTP.HELO(v_conn,p_mailhost);
    UTL_SMTP.MAIL(v_conn,p_sender);
    UTL_SMTP.RCPT(v_conn,p_recipient);
    UTL_SMTP.OPEN_DATA(v_conn);
    UTL_SMTP.WRITE_DATA(v_conn,'From: ' || p_sender || v_crlf);
    UTL_SMTP.WRITE_DATA(v_conn,'To: ' || p_recipient || v_crlf);
    UTL_SMTP.WRITE_DATA(v_conn,'Subject: ' || p_subj || v_crlf);
    UTL_SMTP.WRITE_DATA(v_conn,v_crlf || p_msg);
    UTL_SMTP.CLOSE_DATA(v_conn);
    UTL_SMTP.QUIT(v_conn);
END;

EXEC send_mail_2('asmith@enterprisedb.com','pjones@enterprisedb.com','Holiday
Party','Are you planning to attend?','smtp.enterprisedb.com');
```
