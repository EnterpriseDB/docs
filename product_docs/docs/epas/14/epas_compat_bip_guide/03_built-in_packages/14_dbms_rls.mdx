Advanced Server's implementation of `DBMS_RLS` is a partial implementation when compared to Oracle's version. Only those functions and procedures listed in the table above are supported.

*Virtual Private Database* is a type of fine-grained access control using security policies. *Fine-grained access control* in Virtual Private Database means that access to data can be controlled down to specific rows as defined by the security policy.

The rules that encode a security policy are defined in a *policy function*, which is an SPL function with certain input parameters and return value. The *security policy* is the named association of the policy function to a particular database object, typically a table.

!!! Note
    In Advanced Server, the policy function can be written in any language supported by Advanced Server such as SQL, PL/pgSQL and SPL.

!!! Note
    The database objects currently supported by Advanced Server Virtual Private Database are tables. Policies cannot be applied to views or synonyms.

The advantages of using Virtual Private Database are the following:

-   Provides a fine-grained level of security. Database object level privileges given by the `GRANT` command determine access privileges to the entire instance of a database object, while Virtual Private Database provides access control for the individual rows of a database object instance.
-   A different security policy can be applied depending upon the type of SQL command (`INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE`, or `SELECT`).
-   The security policy can vary dynamically for each applicable SQL command affecting the database object depending upon factors such as the session user of the application accessing the database object.
-   Invocation of the security policy is transparent to all applications that access the database object and thus, individual applications do not have to be modified to apply the security policy.
-   Once a security policy is enabled, it is not possible for any application (including new applications) to circumvent the security policy except by the system privilege noted by the following.
-   Even superusers cannot circumvent the security policy except by the system privilege noted by the following.

!!! Note
    The only way security policies can be circumvented is if the `EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY` system privilege has been granted to a user. The `EXEMPT ACCESS POLICY` privilege should be granted with extreme care as a user with this privilege is exempted from all policies in the database.

The `DBMS_RLS` package provides procedures to create policies, remove policies, enable policies, and disable policies.

The process for implementing Virtual Private Database is as follows:

-   Create a policy function. The function must have two input parameters of type `VARCHAR2`. The first input parameter is for the schema containing the database object to which the policy is to apply and the second input parameter is for the name of that database object. The function must have a `VARCHAR2` return type. The function must return a string in the form of a `WHERE` clause predicate. This predicate is dynamically appended as an `AND` condition to the SQL command that acts upon the database object. Thus, rows that do not satisfy the policy function predicate are filtered out from the SQL command result set.
-   Use the `ADD_POLICY` procedure to define a new policy, which is the association of a policy function with a database object. With the `ADD_POLICY` procedure, you can also specify the types of SQL commands (`INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE`, or `SELECT`) to which the policy is to apply, whether or not to enable the policy at the time of its creation, and if the policy should apply to newly inserted rows or the modified image of updated rows.
-   Use the `ENABLE_POLICY` procedure to disable or enable an existing policy.
-   Use the `DROP_POLICY` procedure to remove an existing policy. The `DROP_POLICY` procedure does not drop the policy function or the associated database object.

Once policies are created, they can be viewed in the catalog views, compatible with Oracle databases: `ALL_POLICIES, DBA_POLICIES`, or `USER_POLICIES`. The supported compatible views are listed in the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Catalog Views Guide*, available at the EDB website at:

[https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/](/epas/latest/epas_compat_cat_views/)

The `SYS_CONTEXT` function is often used with `DBMS_RLS`. The signature is:

```text
SYS_CONTEXT(<namespace>, <attribute>)
```

Where:

 `namespace` is a `VARCHAR2`; the only accepted value is `USERENV`. Any other value will return `NULL`.

 `attribute` is a `VARCHAR2`. `attribute` may be:

| attribute Value  | Equivalent Value              |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `SESSION_USER`   | `pg_catalog.session_user`     |
| `CURRENT_USER`   | `pg_catalog.current_user`     |
| `CURRENT_SCHEMA` | `pg_catalog.current_schema`   |
| `HOST`           | `pg_catalog.inet_host`        |
| `IP_ADDRESS`     | `pg_catalog.inet_client_addr` |
| `SERVER_HOST`    | `pg_catalog.inet_server_addr` |

!!! Note
    The examples used to illustrate the `DBMS_RLS` package are based on a modified copy of the sample `emp` table provided with Advanced Server along with a role named `salesmgr` that is granted all privileges on the table. You can create the modified copy of the `emp` table named `vpemp` and the `salesmgr` role as shown by the following:

```text
CREATE TABLE public.vpemp AS SELECT empno, ename, job, sal, comm, deptno
FROM emp;
ALTER TABLE vpemp ADD authid VARCHAR2(12);
UPDATE vpemp SET authid = 'researchmgr' WHERE deptno = 20;
UPDATE vpemp SET authid = 'salesmgr' WHERE deptno = 30;
SELECT * FROM vpemp;

empno  | ename  |    job    |   sal   |  comm   | deptno |   authid

  7654 | MARTIN | SALESMAN  | 1250.00 | 1400.00 |     30 | salesmgr
  7698 | BLAKE  | MANAGER   | 2850.00 |         |     30 | salesmgr
  7844 | TURNER | SALESMAN  | 1500.00 |    0.00 |     30 | salesmgr
  7900 | JAMES  | CLERK     |  950.00 |         |     30 | salesmgr
(14 rows)

CREATE ROLE salesmgr WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
GRANT ALL ON vpemp TO salesmgr;
```

## ADD_POLICY

The `ADD_POLICY` procedure creates a new policy by associating a policy function with a database object.

You must be a superuser to execute this procedure.

```text
ADD_POLICY(<object_schema> VARCHAR2, <object_name> VARCHAR2,
  <policy_name> VARCHAR2, <function_schema> VARCHAR2,
  <policy_function> VARCHAR2
  [, <statement_types> VARCHAR2
  [, <update_check> BOOLEAN
  [, <enable> BOOLEAN
  [, <static_policy> BOOLEAN
  [, <policy_type> INTEGER
  [, <long_predicate> BOOLEAN
  [, <sec_relevant_cols> VARCHAR2
  [, <sec_relevant_cols_opt> INTEGER ]]]]]]]])
```

### Parameters

`object_schema`

 Name of the schema containing the database object to which the policy is to be applied.

`object_name`

 Name of the database object to which the policy is to be applied. A given database object may have more than one policy applied to it.

`policy_name`

 Name assigned to the policy. The combination of database object (identified by `object_schema` and `object_name`) and policy name must be unique within the database.

`function_schema`

 Name of the schema containing the policy function.

 !!! Note
     The policy function may belong to a package in which case `function_schema` must contain the name of the schema in which the package is defined.

`policy_function`

 Name of the SPL function that defines the rules of the security policy. The same function may be specified in more than one policy.

 !!! Note
     The policy function may belong to a package in which case `policy_function` must also contain the package name in dot notation (that is, `package_name.function_name`).

`statement_types`

 Comma-separated list of SQL commands to which the policy applies. Valid SQL commands are `INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE`, and `SELECT`. The default is `INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE,SELECT`.

 !!! Note
    Advanced Server accepts `INDEX` as a statement type, but it is ignored. Policies are not applied to index operations in Advanced Server.

`update_check`

 Applies to `INSERT` and `UPDATE` SQL commands only.

-   When set to `TRUE`, the policy is applied to newly inserted rows and to the modified image of updated rows. If any of the new or modified rows do not qualify according to the policy function predicate, then the `INSERT` or `UPDATE` command throws an exception and no rows are inserted or modified by the `INSERT` or `UPDATE` command.

-   When set to `FALSE`, the policy is not applied to newly inserted rows or the modified image of updated rows. Thus, a newly inserted row may not appear in the result set of a subsequent SQL command that invokes the same policy. Similarly, rows which qualified according to the policy prior to an `UPDATE` command may not appear in the result set of a subsequent SQL command that invokes the same policy.

-   The default is `FALSE`.

`enable`

 When set to `TRUE`, the policy is enabled and applied to the SQL commands given by the `statement_types` parameter. When set to `FALSE` the policy is disabled and not applied to any SQL commands. The policy can be enabled using the `ENABLE_POLICY` procedure. The default is `TRUE`.

`static_policy`

 In Oracle, when set to `TRUE`, the policy is *static*, which means the policy function is evaluated once per database object the first time it is invoked by a policy on that database object. The resulting policy function predicate string is saved in memory and reused for all invocations of that policy on that database object while the database server instance is running.

-   When set to `FALSE`, the policy is *dynamic*, which means the policy function is re-evaluated and the policy function predicate string regenerated for all invocations of the policy.

-   The default is `FALSE`.

    !!! Note
        In Oracle 10g, the `policy_type` parameter was introduced, which is intended to replace the `static_policy` parameter. In Oracle, if the `policy_type` parameter is not set to its default value of `NULL`, the `policy_type` parameter setting overrides the `static_policy` setting.

    !!! Note
        The setting of `static_policy` is ignored by Advanced Server. Advanced Server implements only the dynamic policy, regardless of the setting of the `static_policy` parameter.

`policy_type`

 In Oracle, determines when the policy function is re-evaluated, and hence, if and when the predicate string returned by the policy function changes. The default is `NULL`.

 !!! Note 
    The setting of this parameter is ignored by Advanced Server. Advanced Server always assumes a dynamic policy.

`long_predicate`

 In Oracle, allows predicates up to 32K bytes if set to `TRUE`, otherwise predicates are limited to 4000 bytes. The default is `FALSE`.

 !!! Note 
    The setting of this parameter is ignored by Advanced Server. An Advanced Server policy function can return a predicate of unlimited length for all practical purposes.

`sec_relevant_cols`

 Comma-separated list of columns of `object_name`. Provides *column-level Virtual Private Database* for the listed columns. The policy is enforced if any of the listed columns are referenced in a SQL command of a type listed in `statement_types`. The policy is not enforced if no such columns are referenced.

 The default is `NULL`, which has the same effect as if all of the database object’s columns were included in `sec_relevant_cols`.

`sec_relevant_cols_opt`

 In Oracle, if `sec_relevant_cols_opt` is set to `DBMS_RLS.ALL_ROWS (INTEGER` constant of value 1), then the columns listed in `sec_relevant_cols` return `NULL` on all rows where the applied policy predicate is false. (If `sec_relevant_cols_opt` is not set to `DBMS_RLS.ALL_ROWS`, these rows would not be returned at all in the result set.) The default is `NULL`.

 !!! Note
     Advanced Server does not support the `DBMS_RLS.ALL_ROWS` functionality. Advanced Server throws an error if `sec_relevant_cols_opt` is set to `DBMS_RLS.ALL_ROWS (INTEGER` value of 1).

### Examples

This example uses the following policy function:

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION verify_session_user (
    p_schema        VARCHAR2,
    p_object        VARCHAR2
)
RETURN VARCHAR2
IS
BEGIN
    RETURN 'authid = SYS_CONTEXT(''USERENV'', ''SESSION_USER'')';
END;
```

This function generates the predicate `authid = SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV', 'SESSION_USER')`, which is added to the `WHERE` clause of any SQL command of the type specified in the `ADD_POLICY` procedure.

This limits the effect of the SQL command to those rows where the content of the `authid` column is the same as the session user.

!!! Note
    This example uses the `SYS_CONTEXT` function to return the login user name. In Oracle the `SYS_CONTEXT` function is used to return attributes of an *application context*. The first parameter of the `SYS_CONTEXT` function is the name of an application context while the second parameter is the name of an attribute set within the application context. `USERENV` is a special built-in namespace that describes the current session. Advanced Server does not support application contexts, but only this specific usage of the `SYS_CONTEXT` function.

The following anonymous block calls the `ADD_POLICY` procedure to create a policy named `secure_update` to be applied to the `vpemp` table using function `verify_session_user` whenever an `INSERT, UPDATE`, or `DELETE` SQL command is given referencing the `vpemp` table.

```text
DECLARE
    v_object_schema         VARCHAR2(30) := 'public';
    v_object_name           VARCHAR2(30) := 'vpemp';
    v_policy_name           VARCHAR2(30) := 'secure_update';
    v_function_schema       VARCHAR2(30) := 'enterprisedb';
    v_policy_function       VARCHAR2(30) := 'verify_session_user';
    v_statement_types       VARCHAR2(30) := 'INSERT,UPDATE,DELETE';
    v_update_check          BOOLEAN      := TRUE;
    v_enable                BOOLEAN      := TRUE;
BEGIN
    DBMS_RLS.ADD_POLICY(
        v_object_schema,
        v_object_name,
        v_policy_name,
        v_function_schema,
        v_policy_function,
        v_statement_types,
        v_update_check,
        v_enable
    );
END;
```

After successful creation of the policy, a terminal session is started by user `salesmgr`. The following query shows the content of the `vpemp` table:

```text
edb=# \c edb salesmgr
Password for user salesmgr:
You are now connected to database "edb" as user "salesmgr".
edb=> SELECT * FROM vpemp;
 empno | ename  |    job    |   sal   |  comm   | deptno |   authid
-------+--------+-----------+---------+---------+--------+-------------
  7782 | CLARK  | MANAGER   | 2450.00 |         |     10 |
  7839 | KING   | PRESIDENT | 5000.00 |         |     10 |
  7934 | MILLER | CLERK     | 1300.00 |         |     10 |
  7369 | SMITH  | CLERK     |  800.00 |         |     20 | researchmgr

  7902 | FORD   | ANALYST   | 3000.00 |         |     20 | researchmgr
  7499 | ALLEN  | SALESMAN  | 1600.00 |  300.00 |     30 | salesmgr
  7521 | WARD   | SALESMAN  | 1250.00 |  500.00 |     30 | salesmgr
  7654 | MARTIN | SALESMAN  | 1250.00 | 1400.00 |     30 | salesmgr
  7698 | BLAKE  | MANAGER   | 2850.00 |         |     30 | salesmgr
  7844 | TURNER | SALESMAN  | 1500.00 |    0.00 |     30 | salesmgr
  7900 | JAMES  | CLERK     |  950.00 |         |     30 | salesmgr
(14 rows)
```

An unqualified `UPDATE` command (no `WHERE` clause) is issued by the `salesmgr` user:

```text
edb=> UPDATE vpemp SET comm = sal * .75;
UPDATE 6
```

Instead of updating all rows in the table, the policy restricts the effect of the update to only those rows where the `authid` column contains the value `salesmgr` as specified by the policy function predicate `authid = SYS_CONTEXT('USERENV', 'SESSION_USER')`.

The following query shows that the `comm` column has been changed only for those rows where `authid` contains `salesmgr`. All other rows are unchanged.

```text
edb=> SELECT * FROM vpemp;
 empno | ename  |    job    |   sal   |  comm   | deptno |   authid
-------+--------+-----------+---------+---------+--------+-------------
  7782 | CLARK  | MANAGER   | 2450.00 |         |     10 |
  7839 | KING   | PRESIDENT | 5000.00 |         |     10 |
  7934 | MILLER | CLERK     | 1300.00 |         |     10 |
  7369 | SMITH  | CLERK     |  800.00 |         |     20 | researchmgr
  7566 | JONES  | MANAGER   | 2975.00 |         |     20 | researchmgr
  7788 | SCOTT  | ANALYST   | 3000.00 |         |     20 | researchmgr
  7876 | ADAMS  | CLERK     | 1100.00 |         |     20 | researchmgr
  7902 | FORD   | ANALYST   | 3000.00 |         |     20 | researchmgr
  7499 | ALLEN  | SALESMAN  | 1600.00 | 1200.00 |     30 | salesmgr
  7521 | WARD   | SALESMAN  | 1250.00 |  937.50 |     30 | salesmgr
  7654 | MARTIN | SALESMAN  | 1250.00 |  937.50 |     30 | salesmgr
  7698 | BLAKE  | MANAGER   | 2850.00 | 2137.50 |     30 | salesmgr
  7844 | TURNER | SALESMAN  | 1500.00 | 1125.00 |     30 | salesmgr
  7900 | JAMES  | CLERK     |  950.00 |  712.50 |     30 | salesmgr
(14 rows)
```

Furthermore, since the `update_check` parameter was set to `TRUE` in the `ADD_POLICY` procedure, the following `INSERT` command throws an exception since the value given for the `authid` column, `researchmgr`, does not match the session user, which is `salesmgr`, and hence, fails the policy.

```text
edb=> INSERT INTO vpemp VALUES (9001,'SMITH','ANALYST',3200.00,NULL,20,
'researchmgr');
ERROR:  policy with check option violation
DETAIL:  Policy predicate was evaluated to FALSE with the updated values
```

If `update_check` was set to `FALSE`, the preceding `INSERT` command would have succeeded.

The following example illustrates the use of the `sec_relevant_cols` parameter to apply a policy only when certain columns are referenced in the SQL command. The following policy function is used for this example, which selects rows where the employee salary is less than `2000`.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sal_lt_2000 (
    p_schema        VARCHAR2,
    p_object        VARCHAR2
)
RETURN VARCHAR2
IS
BEGIN
    RETURN 'sal < 2000';
END
```

The policy is created so that it is enforced only if a `SELECT` command includes columns `sal` or `comm`:

```text
DECLARE
    v_object_schema         VARCHAR2(30) := 'public';
    v_object_name           VARCHAR2(30) := 'vpemp';
    v_policy_name           VARCHAR2(30) := 'secure_salary';
    v_function_schema       VARCHAR2(30) := 'enterprisedb';
    v_policy_function       VARCHAR2(30) := 'sal_lt_2000';
    v_statement_types       VARCHAR2(30) := 'SELECT';
    v_sec_relevant_cols     VARCHAR2(30) := 'sal,comm';
BEGIN
    DBMS_RLS.ADD_POLICY(
        v_object_schema,
        v_object_name,
        v_policy_name,
        v_function_schema,
        v_policy_function,
        v_statement_types,
        sec_relevant_cols => v_sec_relevant_cols
    );
END;
```

If a query does not reference columns `sal` or `comm`, then the policy is not applied. The following query returns all 14 rows of table `vpemp`:

```text
edb=# SELECT empno, ename, job, deptno, authid FROM vpemp;
 empno | ename  |    job    | deptno |   authid

## DROP_POLICY

The `DROP_POLICY` procedure deletes an existing policy. The policy function and database object associated with the policy are not deleted by the `DROP_POLICY` procedure.

You must be a superuser to execute this procedure.

```text
DROP_POLICY(<object_schema> VARCHAR2, <object_name> VARCHAR2,
  <policy_name> VARCHAR2)
```

### Parameters

`object_schema`

 Name of the schema containing the database object to which the policy applies.

`object_name`

 Name of the database object to which the policy applies.

`policy_name`

 Name of the policy to be deleted.

### Examples

The following example deletes policy `secure_update` on table `public.vpemp`:

```text
DECLARE
    v_object_schema         VARCHAR2(30) := 'public';
    v_object_name           VARCHAR2(30) := 'vpemp';
    v_policy_name           VARCHAR2(30) := 'secure_update';
BEGIN
    DBMS_RLS.DROP_POLICY(
        v_object_schema,
        v_object_name,
        v_policy_name
    );
END;
```

## ENABLE_POLICY

The `ENABLE_POLICY` procedure enables or disables an existing policy on the specified database object.

You must be a superuser to execute this procedure.

```text
ENABLE_POLICY(<object_schema> VARCHAR2, <object_name> VARCHAR2,
  <policy_name> VARCHAR2, <enable> BOOLEAN)
```

### Parameters

`object_schema`

 Name of the schema containing the database object to which the policy applies.

`object_name`

 Name of the database object to which the policy applies.

`policy_name`

 Name of the policy to be enabled or disabled.

`enable`

 When set to `TRUE`, the policy is enabled. When set to `FALSE`, the policy is disabled.

### Examples

The following example disables policy `secure_update` on table `public.vpemp`:

```text
DECLARE
    v_object_schema         VARCHAR2(30) := 'public';
    v_object_name           VARCHAR2(30) := 'vpemp';
    v_policy_name           VARCHAR2(30) := 'secure_update';
    v_enable                BOOLEAN := FALSE;
BEGIN
    DBMS_RLS.ENABLE_POLICY(
        v_object_schema,
        v_object_name,
        v_policy_name,
        v_enable
    );
END;
