The `DBMS_PIPE` package provides the capability to send messages through a pipe within or between sessions connected to the same database cluster.

The procedures and functions available in the `DBMS_PIPE` package are listed in the following table:

| Function/procedure                                     | Return type | Description                                                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CREATE_PIPE(pipename [, maxpipesize ] [, private ])`  | `INTEGER`   | Explicitly create a private pipe if `private` is “true” (the default) or a public pipe if `private` is “false”. |
| `NEXT_ITEM_TYPE`                                       | `INTEGER`   | Determine the data type of the next item in a received message.                                                 |
| `PACK_MESSAGE(item)`                                   | n/a         | Place `item` in the session’s local message buffer.                                                             |
| `PURGE(pipename)`                                      | n/a         | Remove unreceived messages from the specified pipe.                                                             |
| `RECEIVE_MESSAGE(pipename [, timeout ])`               | `INTEGER`   | Get a message from a specified pipe.                                                                            |
| `REMOVE_PIPE(pipename)`                                | `INTEGER`   | Delete an explicitly created pipe.                                                                              |
| `RESET_BUFFER`                                         | n/a         | Reset the local message buffer.                                                                                 |
| `SEND_MESSAGE(pipename [, timeout ] [, maxpipesize ])` | `INTEGER`   | Send a message on a pipe.                                                                                       |
| `UNIQUE_SESSION_NAME`                                  | `VARCHAR2`  | Obtain a unique session name.                                                                                   |
| `UNPACK_MESSAGE(item OUT)`                             | n/a         | Retrieve the next data item from a message into a type-compatible variable, `item`.                             |

Pipes are categorized as implicit or explicit. An *implicit pipe* is created if a reference is made to a pipe name that was not previously created by the `CREATE_PIPE` function. For example, if the `SEND_MESSAGE` function is executed using a non-existent pipe name, a new implicit pipe is created with that name. An *explicit pipe* is created using the `CREATE_PIPE` function whereby the first parameter specifies the pipe name for the new pipe.

Pipes are also categorized as private or public. A *private pipe* can only be accessed by the user who created the pipe. Even a superuser cannot access a private pipe that was created by another user. A *public pipe* can be accessed by any user who has access to the `DBMS_PIPE` package.

A public pipe can only be created by using the `CREATE_PIPE` function with the third parameter set to `FALSE`. The `CREATE_PIPE` function can be used to create a private pipe by setting the third parameter to `TRUE` or by omitting the third parameter. All implicit pipes are private.

The individual data items or “lines” of a message are first built-in a *local message buffer*, unique to the current session. The `PACK_MESSAGE` procedure builds the message in the session’s local message buffer. The `SEND_MESSAGE` function is then used to send the message through the pipe.

Receipt of a message involves the reverse operation. The `RECEIVE_MESSAGE` function is used to get a message from the specified pipe. The message is written to the session’s local message buffer. The `UNPACK_MESSAGE` procedure is then used to transfer the message data items from the message buffer to program variables. If a pipe contains multiple messages, `RECEIVE_MESSAGE` gets the messages in *FIFO* (first-in-first-out) order.

Each session maintains separate message buffers for messages created with the `PACK_MESSAGE` procedure and messages retrieved by the `RECEIVE_MESSAGE` function. Thus messages can be both built and received in the same session. However, if consecutive `RECEIVE_MESSAGE` calls are made, only the message from the last `RECEIVE_MESSAGE` call will be preserved in the local message buffer.
