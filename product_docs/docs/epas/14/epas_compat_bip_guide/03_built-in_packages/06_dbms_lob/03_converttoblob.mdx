title: "CONVERTTOBLOB"
---

The `CONVERTTOBLOB` procedure provides the capability to convert character data to binary.

```text
CONVERTTOBLOB(<dest_lob> IN OUT BLOB, <src_clob> CLOB,
  <amount> INTEGER, <dest_offset> IN OUT INTEGER,
  <src_offset> IN OUT INTEGER, <blob_csid> NUMBER,
  <lang_context> IN OUT INTEGER, <warning> OUT INTEGER)
```

**Parameters**

`dest_lob`

 `BLOB` large object locator to which the character data is to be converted.

`src_clob`

 `CLOB` large object locator of the character data to be converted.

`amount`

 Number of characters of `src_clob` to be converted.

`dest_offset IN`

 Position in bytes in the destination `BLOB` where writing of the source `CLOB` should begin. The first byte is offset 1.

`dest_offset OUT`

 Position in bytes in the destination `BLOB` after the write operation completes. The first byte is offset 1.

`src_offset IN`

 Position in characters in the source `CLOB` where conversion to the destination `BLOB` should begin. The first character is offset 1.

`src_offset OUT`

 Position in characters in the source `CLOB` after the conversion operation completes. The first character is offset 1.

`blob_csid`

 Character set ID of the converted, destination `BLOB`.

`lang_context IN`

 Language context for the conversion. The default value of 0 is typically used for this setting.

`lang_context OUT`

 Language context after the conversion completes.

`warning`

 0 if the conversion was successful, 1 if an inconvertible character was encountered.
