title: "INSTR"
---

The `INSTR` function returns the location of the nth occurrence of a given pattern within a large object.

```text
<position> INTEGER INSTR(<lob_loc> { BLOB | CLOB },
   <pattern> { RAW | VARCHAR2 } [, <offset> INTEGER [, <nth> INTEGER ]])
```

## Parameters

`lob_loc`

 Large object locator of the large object in which to search for pattern.

`pattern`

 Pattern of bytes or characters to match against the large object, `lob. pattern` must be `RAW` if `lob_loc` is a `BLOB`. pattern must be `VARCHAR2` if `lob_loc` is a `CLOB`.

`offset`

 Position within `lob_loc` to start search for `pattern`. The first byte/character is position 1. The default is 1.

`nth`

 Search for `pattern`, `nth` number of times starting at the position given by `offset`. The default is 1.

`position`

 Position within the large object where `pattern` appears the nth time specified by `nth` starting from the position given by `offset`.
