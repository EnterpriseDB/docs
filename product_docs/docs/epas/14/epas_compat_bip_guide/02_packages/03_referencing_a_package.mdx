To reference the types, items and subprograms that are declared within a package specification, we use the dot notation. For example:

`package_name.type_name`

`package_name.item_name`

`package_name.subprogram_name`

To invoke a function from the `emp_admin` package specification, we will execute the following SQL command.

```text
SELECT emp_admin.get_dept_name(10) FROM DUAL;
```

Here we are invoking the `get_dept_name` function declared within the package `emp_admin`. We are passing the department number as an argument to the function, which will return the name of the department. Here the value returned should be `ACCOUNTING`, which corresponds to department number `10`.
