Unless otherwise noted, the commands and paths noted in the following section assume that you have performed an installation with the interactive installer.

## Starting and stopping EDB Postgres Advanced Server and supporting components

A service is a program that runs in the background and requires no user interaction (in fact, a service provides no user interface); a service can be configured to start at boot time, or manually on demand. Services are best controlled using the platform-specific operating system service control utility. Many of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server supporting components are services.

The following table lists the names of the services that control EDB Postgres Advanced Server and services that control EDB Postgres Advanced Server supporting components:

| EDB Postgres Advanced Server component name | Windows service name                |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server   | edb-as-14                                        |
| pgAgent                        | EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14 Scheduling Agent |
| PgBouncer                      | edb-pgbouncer-1.14                               |
| Slony                          | edb-slony-replication-14                         |

You can use the command line or the Windows Services applet to control EDB Postgres Advanced Server's database server and the services of EDB Postgres Advanced Server's supporting components on a Windows host.
