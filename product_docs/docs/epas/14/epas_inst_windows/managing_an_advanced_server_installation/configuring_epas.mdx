You can easily update parameters that determine the behavior of EDB Postgres Advanced Server and supporting components by modifying the following configuration files:

-   The `postgresql.conf` file determines the initial values of EDB Postgres Advanced Server configuration parameters.
-   The `pg_hba.conf` file specifies your preferences for network authentication and authorization.
-   The `pg_ident.conf` file maps operating system identities (user names) to EDB Postgres Advanced Server identities (roles) when using `ident`-based authentication.

For more information about Modifying the postgresql.conf file and Modifying the pg_hba.conf file, see [Setting parameters](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/epas_guide/03_database_administration/01_configuration_parameters/01_setting_new_parameters).

You can use your editor of choice to open a configuration file, or on Windows navigate through the `EDB Postgres` menu to open a file.

## Setting EDB Postgres Advanced Server environment variables

The graphical installer provides a script that simplifies the task of setting environment variables for Windows users. The script sets the environment variables for your current shell session; when your shell session ends, the environment variables are destroyed. You may wish to invoke `pgplus_env.bat` from your system-wide shell startup script, so that environment variables are automatically defined for each shell session.

The `pgplus_env` script is created during the EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation process and reflects the choices made during installation. To invoke the script, open a command line and enter:

```text
C:\Program Files\edb\as14\pgplus_env.bat
```

As the `pgplus_env.bat` script executes, it sets the following environment variables:

```text
PATH="C:\Program Files\edb\as14\bin";%PATH%
EDBHOME=C:\Program Files\edb\as14
PGDATA=C:\Program Files\edb\as14\data
PGDATABASE=edb
REM @SET PGUSER=enterprisedb
PGPORT=5444
PGLOCALEDIR=C:\Program Files\edb\as14\share\locale
```

If you have used an installer created by EDB to install PostgreSQL, the `pg_env` script performs the same function:

```text
C:\Progra~1\PostgreSQL\14\pg_env.bat
```

As the `pg_env.bat` script executes on PostgreSQL, it sets the following environment variables:

```text
PATH="C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\bin";%PATH%
PGDATA=C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\data
PGDATABASE=postgres
PGUSER=postgres
PGPORT=5432
PGLOCALEDIR=C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\share\locale
```

## Connecting to EDB Postgres Advanced Server with edb-psql

`edb-psql` is a command line client application that allows you to execute SQL commands and view the results. To open the `edb-psql` client, the client must be in your search path. The executable resides in the `bin` directory, under your EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation.

Use the following command and options to start the `edb-psql` client:

```text
psql -d edb -U enterprisedb
```

![Connecting to the server](../images/connecting_to_server.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 2: Connecting to the server </div>

Where:

`-d` specifies the database to which `edb-psql` will connect.

`-U` specifies the identity of the database user that will be used for the session.

If you have performed an installation with the interactive installer, you can access the `edb-psql` client by selecting `EDB-PSQL` from the `EDB Postgres` menu. When the client opens, provide connection information for your session.

`edb-psql` is a symbolic link to a binary called `psql`, a modified version of the PostgreSQL community `psql`, with added support for Advanced Server features. For more information about using the command line client, see the PostgreSQL Core Documentation at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html>

## Connecting to EDB Postgres Advanced Server with the pgAdmin 4 client

pgAdmin 4 provides an interactive graphical interface that you can use to manage your database and database objects. Easy-to-use dialogs and online help simplify tasks such as object creation, role management, and granting or revoking privileges. The tabbed browser panel provides quick access to information about the object currently selected in the pgAdmin tree control.

The client is distributed with the graphical installer. To open pgAdmin, select pgAdmin4 from the `EDB Postgres` menu. The client opens in your default browser.

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 1: The pgAdmin 4 client Dashboard </div>

To connect to the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database server, expand the `Servers` node of the `Browser` tree control, and right click on the `EDB Postgres Advanced Server` node. When the context menu opens, select `Connect Server`. The `Connect to Server` dialog opens.

Provide the password associated with the database superuser in the `Password` field, and click `OK` to connect.

When the client connects, you can use the `Browser` tree control to retrieve information about existing database objects, or to create new objects. For more information about using the pgAdmin client, use the `Help` drop-down menu to access the online help files.
