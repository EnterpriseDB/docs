title: "Setting Advanced Server Environment Variables"

<div id="setting_advanced_server_environment_variables" class="registered_link"></div>

The graphical installer provides a script that simplifies the task of setting environment variables for Windows users. The script sets the environment variables for your current shell session; when your shell session ends, the environment variables are destroyed. You may wish to invoke `pgplus_env.bat` from your system-wide shell startup script, so that environment variables are automatically defined for each shell session.

The `pgplus_env` script is created during the Advanced Server installation process and reflects the choices made during installation. To invoke the script, open a command line and enter:

```text
C:\Program Files\edb\as14\pgplus_env.bat
```

As the `pgplus_env.bat` script executes, it sets the following environment variables:

```text
PATH="C:\Program Files\edb\as14\bin";%PATH%
EDBHOME=C:\Program Files\edb\as14
PGDATA=C:\Program Files\edb\as14\data
PGDATABASE=edb
REM @SET PGUSER=enterprisedb
PGPORT=5444
PGLOCALEDIR=C:\Program Files\edb\as14\share\locale
```

If you have used an installer created by EDB to install PostgreSQL, the `pg_env` script performs the same function:

```text
C:\Progra~1\PostgreSQL\14\pg_env.bat
```

As the `pg_env.bat` script executes on PostgreSQL, it sets the following environment variables:

```text
PATH="C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\bin";%PATH%
PGDATA=C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\data
PGDATABASE=postgres
PGUSER=postgres
PGPORT=5432
PGLOCALEDIR=C:\Program Files\PostgreSQL\14\share\locale
```
