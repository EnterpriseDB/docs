## Difficulty displaying Java-based applications

If you encounter difficulty displaying Java-based server features (controls or text not being displayed correctly, or blank windows), upgrading to the latest `libxcb-xlib` libraries should correct the problem on most distributions. Please visit the following link for other possible work-arounds:

## - -mode unattended authentication errors

Authentication errors from component modules during unattended installations may indicate that the specified values of `--servicepassword` or `--superpassword` may be incorrect.

## Errors during an Advanced Server installation

If you encounter an error during the installation process, exit the installation, and ensure that your version of Windows is up-to-date. After applying any outstanding operating system updates, re-invoke the Advanced Server installer.

## The installation fails to complete due to existing data directory contents

If an installation fails to complete due to existing content in the data directory, the server will write an error message to the server logs:

`A data directory is neither empty, or a recognisable data directory`.

If you encounter a similar message, you should confirm that the data directory is empty; the presence of files (including the system-generated `lost+found` folder) will prevent the installation from completing. Either remove the files from the data directory, or specify a different location for the data directory before re-invoking the installer to complete the installation.
