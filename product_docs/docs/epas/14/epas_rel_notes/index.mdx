With this Beta 1 release of EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14, EnterpriseDB continues to lead as the only worldwide company to deliver innovative and low-cost, open-source-derived database solutions with commercial quality, ease of use, compatibility, scalability, and performance for small or large-scale enterprises.

EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14 Beta 1 is built on open-source PostgreSQL 14 Beta 2, which introduces a myriad of enhancements that enable databases to scale up and scale out in more efficient ways. PostgreSQL 14 has features such as indexing enhancements, performance improvements, and modules such as `pg_amcheck` and `pg_surgery` that help DBAs during data corruption. PostgreSQL 14 is a level up in SQL syntaxes, data types, and has a multitude of other new features and capabilities.

EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14 Beta 1 adds a number of new features, including:

-   Access to create and last DDL time for objects.
-   Implementation of `SUBPARTITION TEMPLATE`.
-   Enhancements in the `CONNECT_BY` feature.

## EDB Postgres Advanced Server (Advanced Server) v14 Features

The major highlights of this release are :

-   Access to create and last DDL time for objects.
    
    This feature allows a user to track an object when it is created and last modified. Users can now view the created and last DDL time through respective redwood compatible views.
-  Implementation of `SUBPARTITION TEMPLATE`.

   With the `SUBPARTITION TEMPLATE` clause, you can provide the subpartition descriptor to create subpartitions for each table partition. Specify the `TEMPLATE` once, and it gets applied to every partition automatically.
-  Access the partition by `PARTITION (<partname>)` or subpartition by `SUBPARTITION (<subpartname>)` clause.

   Advanced Server allows access to the particular partition using the `PARTITION(<partname>)` clause and subpartition using the `SUBPARTITION(<subpartname>)` clause for `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, and `DELETE` queries.
-  Advanced Server has enhanced the `CONNECT_BY` feature and supports:
   -  Use of multiple `PRIOR` expressions.
   -  Use `AND/OR` with multiple conditions to allow any combination of Unary, Binary, or Prior expressions.
   -  Use of Unary expressions.
   -  Make `PRIOR` optional with `CONNECT BY` query.
   -  Enhance the function to detect the cycle to work with multiple `PRIOR` expressions.
   -  Support for `CONNECT_BY_ISCYCLE` and `NOCYCLE`.
   -  Support `PRIOR` in the target list.
-  Add support for object-level auditing.
  
   Object Auditing allows selective auditing of objects for specific DML statements such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` in the `edb_audit_statement` GUC, including or excluding certain groups. Object Auditing allows users to either include `(@)` or exclude `(-)` particular statement type for a relation. Currently, this feature supports `{SELECT | UPDATE | DELETE | INSERT}@groupname`, statement type for a group.
-  Audit Log Archiver.

   A new parameter `edb_audit_archiver` is introduced, which helps DBA to control the space consumed by the audit log directory and manage the audit log files. The `edb_audit_archiver` parameter helps in compressing the old audit log files by specifying the compression command and executing the command before removing the old audit log files.
 
-  Add support for `USERENV()`.

   This function provides user environment and session-related details.
 
-  Add Redwood compatible bitwise `AND` and `OR` functions and aggregates.
 
   Unlike existing bitwise functions and aggregates, these also support bitwise operation on a numeric data type for the Redwood compatibility. In addition, added bitwise '&' and '|' operators for the numeric data type.
-  Support for an alias on the table name in an `INSERT` statement.

   Advanced Server supports `ALIAS` for accessing a partition or subpartition with `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements to qualify the table columns. For Example: `INSERT INTO table_name t (t.col1) VALUES (10);`
 
-  Provide an option to audit the `SET` commands.

   This feature provides an option in `edb_audit_statement` to log the `SET` commands. To enable this user needs to modify the `log_statement` GUC.
 
-  Enhance `DBMS_SQL` to be compatible with Oracle.

   Enhanced `DBMS_SQL` function accepts `NUMBER` instead of `INTEGER` so that both `INTEGER` to `NUMBER` functions can accept both `NUMBER` and `INTEGER` type values. Since these functions are compatible with both `NUMBER` and `INTEGER`, we need to restrict the input range within the `INTEGER`'s limit.
-  Create `ROWID` columns with `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA`.

   When the remote table has a rowid column, then the foreign table that gets created as part of the `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA` used to skip the rowid column for a foreign table. This feature supports rowids columns to be created for the foreign table.
 
-  Advanced Server now uses a global sequence for the `ROWID`s.

   Now, `ROWID` is unique across the database, which allows using `ROWID`s on the partitioned table. 
 
-  Enhance `NVL2` to use `ANYCOMPATIBLE` pseudo-type.

   This feature allows the `NVL2` function to support considerably more argument-type combinations than before. For example, the `NVL2` version can match a call with one `INTEGER` and rest `BIGINT` arguments; the `INTEGER` is automatically promoted to `BIGINT`. With the previous `ANYELEMENT` version, the user had to cast the `INTEGER` explicitly.

-  Improved Oracle compatibility syntax, which allows users to migrate to EDB Postgres Advanced Server without applying the syntax changes during migration.

   `ENABLE` keyword is supported for the query to get accepted and generate the same result as Oracle (a default index created for the constraint).
 
   When a user runs a query with the `USING INDEX ENABLE` construct, the query is accepted and generates the same result as Oracle.
 
   When a user tries to create a sequence with a too high upper boundary, Advanced Server applies the upper boundary and logs a warning message.
 
   When a user creates a sequence specifying the `NOORDER` keyword, the keyword is considered a `NOOP` keyword. A warning message is logged stating that the `NOORDER` keyword has no beneficial effect in EDB Postgres Advanced and is ignored. 
 
   `NOCYCLE` keyword is now accepted and implemented as the (already existing) `NOCYCLE` keyword.
-   With the `\h` command, the user can see the syntax on a psql prompt. Extended `\h` support to work with EDB Postgres Advanced Server objects.
 
-   Added tab-completion support for EDB Postgres Advanced Server syntaxes.
