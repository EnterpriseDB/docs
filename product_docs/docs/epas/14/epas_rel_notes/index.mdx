| Upstream Merge | EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14.1.0 is built on open-source PostgreSQL 14.1, which introduces a myriad of enhancements that enable databases to scale up and scale out in more efficient ways. See the [PostgreSQL 14 Release Notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/14/release-14.html) for more information. See also [PostgreSQL 14 Open Items](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/PostgreSQL_14_Open_Items).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Feature        | Store creation and last DDL time for all SQL objects:  Allows a user to track an object when it is created and last modified. Users can now view the created and last DDL time through respective Redwood-compatible views.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Feature        | Implementation of `SUBPARTITION TEMPLATE`: With the `SUBPARTITION TEMPLATE` clause, you can provide the subpartition descriptor to create subpartitions for each table partition. Specify the `TEMPLATE` once, and it gets applied to every partition automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Feature        | Access to a partition by `PARTITION (<partname>)` or subpartition by `SUBPARTITION (<subpartname>)` clause: Allows access to the particular partition using the `PARTITION(<partname>)` clause and subpartition using the `SUBPARTITION(<subpartname>)` clause for `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, and `DELETE` queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Feature        | Support for object-level auditing: Allows selective auditing of objects for specific DML statements such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` in the `edb_audit_statement` GUC, including or excluding certain groups. Allows users to either include `(@)` or exclude `(-)` particular statement type for a relation. Currently supports the `{SELECT | UPDATE | DELETE | INSERT}@groupname` statement type for a group. For more information see [Object Auditing](../epas_guide/03_database_administration/05_edb_audit_logging/09_object_auditing/).                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Feature        | Audit Log Archiver: A new parameter `edb_audit_archiver` helps a DBA to control the space consumed by the audit log directory and manage the audit log files. The `edb_audit_archiver` parameter helps in compressing the old audit log files by specifying the compression command and executing the command before removing the old audit log files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Feature        | Support for `USERENV()`: Provides user environment and session-related details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Feature        | Redwood-compatible bitwise `AND` and `OR` functions and aggregates:   Unlike existing bitwise functions and aggregates, these also support bitwise operation on a numeric data type for Redwood compatibility. In addition, there is support for bitwise '&' and '|' operators for the numeric data type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| Feature        | Support for an alias on the table name in an `INSERT` statement: You can use `ALIAS` to access a partition or subpartition with `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements to qualify the table columns. For example, `INSERT INTO table_name t (t.col1) VALUES (10);`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| Feature        | Option to audit the `SET` commands: There is a new option in `edb_audit_statement` to log the `SET` commands. To enable this you need to modify the `log_statement` GUC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Feature        | `DBMS_SQL` compatible with Oracle: The enhanced `DBMS_SQL` function accepts `NUMBER` instead of `INTEGER` so that both `INTEGER` to `NUMBER` functions can accept both `NUMBER` and `INTEGER` type values. Since these functions are compatible with both `NUMBER` and `INTEGER`, EDB Postgres Advanced Server restricts the input range within the `INTEGER`'s limit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Feature        | Create `ROWID` columns with `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA`: When the remote table has a `rowid` column, the foreign table that gets created as part of the `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA` previously skipped the `rowid` column for a foreign table. Allows `rowids` columns to be created for the foreign table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Feature        | Global sequence for the `ROWID`s: `ROWID` is now unique across the database, which allows using `ROWID`s on the partitioned table.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Feature        | `NVL2` uses `ANYCOMPATIBLE` pseudo-type: Allows the `NVL2` function to support considerably more argument-type combinations. For example, the `NVL2` version can match a call with one `INTEGER` and multiple `BIGINT` arguments and the `INTEGER` is automatically promoted to `BIGINT`. With the previous `ANYELEMENT` version, you had to cast the `INTEGER` explicitly.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Feature        | The `\h` command now displays the syntax on a psql prompt for EDB Postgres Advanced Server objects.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| Feature        | Improved Oracle compatibility syntax:<br />-    Migrate from Oracle without applying syntax changes for `ENABLE`.<br />-  Migrate from Oracle without applying syntax changes for `USING INDEX ENABLE`.<br />-    Migrate from Oracle without applying syntax changes for `NOCYCLE`.<br />-    Migrate from Oracle without applying syntax changes for a sequence with a too high upper boundary. Now EDB Postgres Advanced Server applies the upper boundary and logs a warning message.<br />-    Migrate from Oracle without applying syntax changes for a sequence specifying the `NOORDER` keyword. The keyword is considered a `NOOP` keyword. A warning message is logged stating that the `NOORDER` keyword has no beneficial effect in EDB Postgres Advanced Server and is ignored.   |
| Enhancement    | `CONNECT_BY` feature enhancements:<br />-    Allow the use of multiple PRIOR expressions.<br />-    Use AND/OR with multiple conditions to allow any combination of Unary, Binary or Prior expressions.<br />-    Use of Unary expressions.<br />-    Make PRIOR optional with CONNECT BY query.<br />-    Enhance the function to detect the cycle, so that it can work with multiple PRIOR expressions.<br />-    Support PRIOR in the target list.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
