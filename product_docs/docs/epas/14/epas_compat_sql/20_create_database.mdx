## Name

`CREATE DATABASE` -- create a new database.

## Synopsis

```text
CREATE DATABASE <name>
```

## Description

`CREATE DATABASE` creates a new database.

To create a database, you must be a superuser or have the special `CREATEDB` privilege. Normally, the creator becomes the owner of the new database. Non-superusers with `CREATEDB` privilege can only create databases owned by them.

The new database is created by cloning the standard system database `template1`.

## Parameters

`name`

 The name of the database to be created.

## Notes

`CREATE DATABASE` cannot be executed inside a transaction block.

Errors along the line of “could not initialize database directory” are most likely related to insufficient permissions on the data directory, a full disk, or other file system problems.

## Examples

To create a new database:

```text
CREATE DATABASE employees;
```
