**Name**

`CREATE DATABASE` -- create a new database.

**Synopsis**

```text
CREATE DATABASE <name>
```

**Description**

`CREATE DATABASE` creates a new database.

To create a database, you must be a superuser or have the special `CREATEDB` privilege. Normally, the creator becomes the owner of the new database. Non-superusers with `CREATEDB` privilege can only create databases owned by them.

The new database will be created by cloning the standard system database `template1`.

**Parameters**

`name`

 The name of the database to be created.

**Notes**

`CREATE DATABASE` cannot be executed inside a transaction block.

Errors along the line of “could not initialize database directory” are most likely related to insufficient permissions on the data directory, a full disk, or other file system problems.

**Examples**

To create a new database:

```text
CREATE DATABASE employees;
```
