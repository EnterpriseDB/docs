Advanced Server includes extra syntax (not offered by Oracle) with the `CREATE QUEUE SQL` command. This syntax can be used in association with `DBMS_AQADM`.

**Name**

`CREATE QUEUE` -- create a queue.

**Synopsis**

Use `CREATE QUEUE` to define a new queue:

```text
CREATE QUEUE <name> QUEUE TABLE <queue_table_name> [ ( { <option_name option_value>} [, ... ] ) ]
```

where `option_name` and the corresponding `option_value` can be:

```text
TYPE [normal_queue | exception_queue]
RETRIES [INTEGER]
RETRYDELAY [DOUBLE PRECISION]
RETENTION [DOUBLE PRECISION]
```

**Description**

The `CREATE QUEUE` command allows a database superuser or any user with the system-defined `aq_administrator_role` privilege to create a new queue in the current database.

If the name of the queue is schema-qualified, the queue is created in the specified schema. If a schema is not included in the `CREATE QUEUE` command, the queue is created in the current schema. A queue may only be created in the schema in which the queue table resides. The name of the queue must be unique from the name of any other queue in the same schema.

Use `DROP QUEUE` to remove a queue.

**Parameters**

`name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the queue to be created.

`queue_table_name`

 The name of the queue table with which this queue is associated.

`option_name option_value`

 The name of any options that will be associated with the new queue, and the corresponding value for the option. If the call to `CREATE QUEUE` includes duplicate option names, the server will return an error. The following values are accepted:

-   `TYPE`: Specify `normal_queue` to indicate that the queue is a normal queue, or `exception_queue` to indicate that the queue is an exception queue. An exception queue will only accept dequeue operations.
-   `RETRIES`: An `INTEGER` value that specifies the maximum number of attempts to remove a message from a queue.                                                       
-   `RETRYDELAY`: A `DOUBLE PRECISION` value that specifies the number of seconds after a `ROLLBACK` that the server will wait before retrying a message.                                                            
-   `RETENTION`: A `DOUBLE PRECISION` value that specifies the number of seconds that a message will be saved in the queue table after dequeueing.                                                                  

**Examples**

The following command creates a queue named `work_order` that is associated with a queue table named `work_order_table`:

```text
CREATE QUEUE work_order QUEUE TABLE work_order_table (RETRIES 5, RETRYDELAY 2);
```

The server will allow 5 attempts to remove a message from the queue, and enforce a retry delay of 2 seconds between attempts.
