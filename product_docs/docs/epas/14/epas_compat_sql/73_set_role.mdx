**Name**

`SET ROLE` -- set the current user identifier of the current session.

**Synopsis**

```text
SET ROLE { rolename | NONE }
```

**Description**

This command sets the current user identifier of the current SQL session context to be `rolename`. After `SET ROLE`, permissions checking for SQL commands is carried out as though the named role is the one that had logged in originally.

The specified `rolename` must be a role that the current session user is a member of. If the session user is a superuser, any role can be selected.

`NONE` resets the current user identifier to be the current session user identifier. These forms may be executed by any user.

**Notes**

You can use this command, to either add privileges or restrict one's privileges. If the session user role has the `INHERITS` attribute, then it automatically has all the privileges of every role that it could `SET ROLE` to; in this case `SET ROLE` effectively drops all the privileges assigned directly to the session user and to the other roles it is a member of, leaving only the privileges available to the named role. If the session user role has the `NOINHERITS` attribute, `SET ROLE` drops the privileges assigned directly to the session user and instead acquires the privileges available to the named role. When a superuser chooses to `SET ROLE` to a non-superuser role, she loses her superuser privileges.

**Examples**

User `mary` takes on the identity of role `admins`:

```text
SET ROLE admins;
```

User `mary` reverts back to her own identity:

```text
SET ROLE NONE;
```
