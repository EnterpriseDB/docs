## Name

`DROP SYNONYM` -- remove a synonym.

## Synopsis

```text
DROP [PUBLIC] SYNONYM [<schema>.]<syn_name>
```

## Description

`DROP SYNONYM` deletes existing synonyms. To execute this command you must be a superuser or the owner of the synonym, and have `USAGE` privileges on the schema in which the synonym resides.

## Parameters

`syn_name`

 `syn_name` is the name of the synonym. A synonym name must be unique within a schema.

`schema`

 `schema` specifies the name of the schema that the synonym resides in.

Like any other object that can be schema-qualified, you may have two synonyms with the same name in your search path. To disambiguate the name of the synonym that you are dropping, include a schema name. Unless a synonym is schema qualified in the `DROP SYNONYM` command, EDB Postgres Advanced Server deletes the first instance of the synonym it finds in your search path.

You can optionally include the `PUBLIC` clause to drop a synonym that resides in the `public` schema. The `DROP PUBLIC SYNONYM` command, compatible with Oracle databases, drops a synonym that resides in the `public` schema:

```text
DROP PUBLIC SYNONYM syn_name;
```

The following example drops the synonym, `personnel`:

```text
DROP SYNONYM personnel;
```
