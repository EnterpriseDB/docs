## Name

`ALTER TRIGGER` -- change the definition of a trigger.

## Synopsis

Advanced Server supports three variations of the `ALTER TRIGGER` command. Use the first variation to change the name of a given trigger without changing the trigger definition.

```text
ALTER TRIGGER <name> ON <table_name> RENAME TO <new_name>
```

Use the second variation of the `ALTER TRIGGER` command if the trigger is dependent on an extension; if the extension is dropped the trigger will automatically be dropped as well.

```text
ALTER TRIGGER <name> ON <table_name> DEPENDS ON EXTENSION <extension_name>
```

Use the third variation of the `ALTER TRIGGER` command to change the ownership of a trigger's object.

```text
ALTER TRIGGER <name> ON <table_name> AUTHORIZATION <rolespec>
```

For information about using non-compatible implementations of the `ALTER TRIGGER` command that are supported by Advanced Server, see the PostgreSQL core documentation at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertrigger.html>

## Description

`ALTER TRIGGER` changes the properties of existing trigger. You must own the table on which the trigger acts to be allowed to change its properties.

To alter an owner of the trigger's implicit object you can use the `ALTER TRIGGER ...ON AUTHORIZATION` command. You must have the privilege to execute `ALTER TRIGGER ...ON AUTHORIZATION` command to assign the trigger's implicit object ownership to a user after authorization.

## Parameters

`name`

 The name of the trigger to be altered.

`table_name`

 The name of a table on which trigger acts.

`rolespec`

 The `rolespec` determines an owner of trigger objects.

## Examples

The following example includes user `bob` and `carol` as superusers. The user `bob` owns a table `emp` and user `carol` owns a trigger named `emp_sal_trig`, which is created on table `emp`:

```text
SELECT relname, relowner::regrole FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'emp';
 relname | relowner
---------+----------
 emp     | bob
(1 row)
```

```text
SELECT proname, proowner::regrole FROM pg_proc WHERE oid = (SELECT tgfoid
FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'emp_sal_trig') ORDER BY oid;
 proname           | proowner
-------------------+----------
 emp_sal_trig_emp  | carol
(1 row)
```

To alter the ownership of table `emp` from user `bob` to a new owner `edb`:

```text
ALTER TABLE emp OWNER TO edb;
ALTER TABLE

SELECT relname, relowner::regrole FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'emp';
 relname | relowner
---------+----------
 emp     | edb
(1 row)
```

The table ownership is changed from user `bob` to an owner `edb` but the trigger ownership of `emp_sal_trig` is not altered and owned by user `carol`. Now alter the trigger `emp_sal_trig` on table `emp` and grant authorization to an owner `edb`:

```text
ALTER TRIGGER emp_sal_trig ON emp AUTHORIZATION edb;
ALTER TRIGGER

SELECT proname, proowner::regrole FROM pg_proc WHERE oid = (SELECT tgfoid
FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'emp_sal_trig') ORDER BY oid;
 proname          | proowner
------------------+----------
 emp_sal_trig_emp | edb
(1 row)
```

The trigger ownership `emp_sal_trig` on table `emp` is altered and granted to an owner `edb`.
