title: "pg_upgrade Troubleshooting"
---

The troubleshooting tips in this section address problems you may encounter when using `pg_upgrade`.

## Upgrade Error - There seems to be a postmaster servicing the cluster

If `pg_upgrade` reports that a postmaster is servicing the cluster, please stop all Advanced Server services and try the upgrade again.

## Upgrade Error - fe_sendauth: no password supplied

If `pg_upgrade` reports an authentication error that references a missing password, please modify the `pg_hba.conf` files in the old and new cluster to enable `trust` authentication, or configure the system to use a `pgpass.conf` file.

## Upgrade Error - New cluster is not empty; exiting

If `pg_upgrade` reports that the new cluster is not empty, please empty the new cluster. The target cluster may not contain any user-defined databases.

## Upgrade Error - Failed to load library

If the original Advanced Server cluster included libraries that are not included in the Advanced Server 14 cluster, `pg_upgrade` will alert you to the missing component during the consistency check by writing an entry to the `loadable_libraries.txt` file in the directory from which you invoked `pg_upgrade`. Generally, for missing libraries that are not part of a major component upgrade, perform the following steps:

1.  Restart the Advanced Server service.

    Use StackBuilder Plus to download and install the missing module. Then:

2.  Stop the Advanced Server service.

3.  Resume the upgrade process: invoke `pg_upgrade` to perform consistency checking.

4.  When you have resolved any remaining problems noted in the consistency checks, invoke `pg_upgrade` to perform the data migration from the old cluster to the new cluster.
