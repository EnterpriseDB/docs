Unless otherwise noted, the commands and paths noted in the following section assume that you have performed an installation using the native packages.

## Starting and Stopping EDB Postgres Advanced Server and Supporting Components

A service is a program that runs in the background and requires no user interaction (in fact, a service provides no user interface); a service can be configured to start at boot time, or manually on demand. Services are best controlled using the platform-specific operating system service control utility. Many of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server supporting components are services.

The following table lists the names of the services that control EDB Postgres Advanced Server and services that control EDB Postgres Advanced Server supporting components:

| EDB Postgres Advanced Server Component Name | Linux Service Name       | Debian Service Name                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server                | edb-as-14                | edb-as@14-main                          |
| pgAgent                        | edb-pgagent-14           | edb-as14-pgagent                        |
| PgBouncer                      | edb-pgbouncer-1.14       | edb-pgbouncer114                        |
| pgPool-II                      | edb-pgpool-4.1           | edb-pgpool41                            |
| Slony                          | edb-slony-replication-14 | edb-as14-slony-replication              |
| EFM                            | edb-efm-4.0              | edb-efm-4.0                             |

You can use the Linux command line to control EDB Postgres Advanced Server's database server and the services of EDB Postgres Advanced Server's supporting components. The commands that control the EDB Postgres Advanced Server service on a Linux platform are host specific.

### Controlling a Service on RHEL/CentOS 7.x or RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8.x

If your installation of EDB Postgres Advanced Server resides on version 7.x | 8.x of RHEL and CentOS, you must use the `systemctl` command to control the EDB Postgres Advanced Server service and supporting components.

The `systemctl` command must be in your search path and must be invoked with superuser privileges. To use the command, open a command line, and enter:

```text
systemctl <action> <service_name>
```

Where:

`service_name` specifies the name of the service.

`action` specifies the action taken by the service command. Specify:

-   `start` to start the service.
-   `stop` to stop the service.
-   `restart` to stop and then start the service.
-   `status` to discover the current status of the service.

### Controlling a Service on Debian 9.x | 10.x or Ubuntu 18.04 | 20.04

If your installation of EDB Postgres Advanced Server resides on version 9.x of Debian or 18.04 | 20.04 of Ubuntu, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following commands (using bundled scripts) to manage the service. Use the following commands to:

-   Discover the current status of a service:

    ```text
    /usr/edb/as14/bin/epas_ctlcluster 14 main status
    ```

-   Stop a service:

    ```text
    /usr/edb/as14/bin/epas_ctlcluster 14 main stop
    ```

-   Restart a service:

    ```text
    /usr/edb/as14/bin/epas_ctlcluster 14 main restart
    ```

-   Reload a service:

    ```text
    /usr/edb/as14/bin/epas_ctlcluster 14 main reload
    ```

-   Control the component services:

    ```text
    systemctl restart edb-as@14-main
    ```

### Using pg_ctl to Control EDB Postgres Advanced Server

You can use the `pg_ctl` utility to control an EDB Postgres Advanced Server service from the command line on any platform. `pg_ctl` allows you to start, stop, or restart the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database server, reload the configuration parameters, or display the status of a running server. To invoke the utility, assume the identity of the cluster owner, navigate into the home directory of EDB Postgres Advanced Server, and issue the command:

```text
./bin/pg_ctl -D <data_directory> <action>
```

`data_directory` is the location of the data controlled by the EDB Postgres Advanced Server cluster.

`action` specifies the action taken by the `pg_ctl` utility. Specify:

-   `start` to start the service.
-   `stop` to stop the service.
-   `restart` to stop and then start the service.
-   `reload` sends the server a `SIGHUP` signal, reloading configuration parameters
-   `status` to discover the current status of the service.

For more information about using the `pg_ctl` utility, or the command line options available, see the official PostgreSQL Core Documentation available at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-pg-ctl.html>

**Choosing Between pg_ctl and the service Command**

You can use the `pg_ctl` utility to manage the status of an EDB Postgres Advanced Server cluster, but it is important to note that `pg_ctl` does not alert the operating system service controller to changes in the status of a server, so it is beneficial to use the `service` command whenever possible.

### Configuring Component Services to AutoStart at System Reboot

After installing, configuring, and starting the services of EDB Postgres Advanced Server supporting components on a Linux system, you must manually configure your system to autostart the service when your system reboots. To configure a service to autostart on a Linux system, open a command line, assume superuser privileges, and enter the following command.

On a Redhat-compatible Linux system, enter:

```text
/sbin/chkconfig <service_name> on
```

Where `service_name` specifies the name of the service.

## Connecting to EDB Postgres Advanced Server with edb-psql

`edb-psql` is a command line client application that allows you to execute SQL commands and view the results. To open the `edb-psql` client, the client must be in your search path. The executable resides in the `bin` directory, under your EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation.

Use the following command and options to start the `edb-psql` client:

```text
psql -d edb -U enterprisedb
```

Where:

`-d` specifies the database to which `edb-psql` will connect.

`-U` specifies the identity of the database user that will be used for the session.

`edb-psql` is a symbolic link to PostgreSQL community `psql`. For more information about using the command line client, see the PostgreSQL Core Documentation at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html>
