# Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14 on RHEL 7 x86_64

This topic describes how to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server and includes steps for getting started with your cluster and creating a database.

There are three steps to completing an installation:

- Setting up the repository
- Installing the package
- Performing the initial configuration.

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

To log in as a superuser:

```sh
sudo su -
```

## Setting up the Repository

1. To register with EDB to receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request)

1. Set up the EDB repository:

   ```sh
   yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
   ```

   This creates the /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo configuration file.

1. Replace `'USERNAME:PASSWORD'` below with your username and password available from your
   [EDB account](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user) in the edb.repo file:

   ```sh
   sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
   ```

1. Install EPEL repository and refresh the cache:

   ```sh
   yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
   yum makecache
   ```

### Enable the optional, extras, and HA repositories since EPEL packages may depend on packages from these repositories

```sh
subscription-manager repos --enable "rhel-*-optional-rpms" --enable "rhel-*-extras-rpms"  --enable "rhel-ha-for-rhel-*-server-rpms"
```

## Installing the Package

```sh
yum -y install edb-as14-server
```

## Initial Configuration

1. Initialize the database cluster:

   ```sh
   PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS="-E UTF-8" /usr/edb/as14/bin/edb-as-14-setup initdb
   ```

1. Start the database cluster:

   ```sh
   systemctl start edb-as-14
   ```

## Connecting to Your Database cluster

This section helps you through getting started with your cluster including logging in, ensuring the installation and initial configuration was successful, connecting to your cluster, and creating the user password.

1. Connect to the database server using psql command line client:

   ```sh
   psql edb
   ```

   See [Managing Your Cluster > Connecting to Your Cluster], for more information including how to use pgAdmin4 to connect to your cluster using its graphical interface.

1. Then, assign a password to the database superuser `enterprisedb`:

   ```sh
   ALTER ROLE enterprisedb IDENTIFIED BY password;
   ```

## Creating a Database

This section steps you through creating and adding data to a simple database.

1. Create a database (named hr):

   ```sh
   CREATE DATABASE hr;
   ```

1. Connect to the new database and create a table (named dept):

   ```sh
   \c hr
   CREATE TABLE public.dept (deptno numeric(2) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT dept_pk
   PRIMARY KEY, dname varchar(14) CONSTRAINT dept_dname_uq UNIQUE, loc
   varchar(13));
   ```

1. Add data to the table:

   ```sh
   INSERT INTO dept VALUES (10,'ACCOUNTING','NEW YORK');
   INSERT into dept VALUES (20,'RESEARCH','DALLAS');
   ```

1. You can use simple SQL commands to query the database and retrieve information about the data you have added to the table:

   ```sh
   SELECT * FROM dept;
   deptno |   dname    |   loc
   --------+------------+----------
   10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
   20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
   (2 rows)
   ```
