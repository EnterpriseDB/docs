# Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14 on CentOS 8 x86_64

This topic describes how to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server and includes steps for getting started with your cluster and creating a database.

There are three steps to completing an installation:

- Setting up the repository
- Installing the package
- Performing the initial configuration.

For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

To log in as a superuser:

```sh
sudo su -
```

## Setting up the Repository

1. To register with EDB to receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request)

1. Set up the EDB repository:

   ```sh
   dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
   ```

   This creates the /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo configuration file.

1. Replace `'USERNAME:PASSWORD'` below with your username and password available from your
   [EDB account](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user) in the edb.repo file:

   ```sh
   sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
   ```

1. Install EPEL repository and refresh the cache:

   ```sh
   dnf -y install epel-release
   dnf makecache
   ```

1. Enable the powertools repository since EPEL packages may depend on packages from it:

   ```sh
   dnf config-manager --set-enabled powertools
   ```

1. Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:

   ```sh
   dnf -qy module disable postgresql
   ```

## Installing the Package

```sh
dnf -y install edb-as14-server
```

Installing the server package creates an operating system user named `enterprisedb`. The user is assigned a user ID (UID) and a group ID (GID) of `26`. The user has no default password. Use the `passwd` command to assign a password for the user. The default shell for the user is `bash` and the user's home directory is `/var/lib/edb/as14`.

## Initial Configuration

1. Initialize the database cluster:

   ```sh
   PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS="-E UTF-8" /usr/edb/as14/bin/edb-as-14-setup initdb
   ```

1. Start the database cluster:

   ```sh
   systemctl start edb-as-14
   ```

## Connecting to Your Database cluster

This section helps you through getting started with your cluster including logging in, ensuring the installation and initial configuration was successful, connecting to your cluster, and creating the user password.

1. To ensure the installation and initial configuration was successful, check the status of your cluster:

   ```sh
   /usr/edb/as14/bin/pg_ctl status -D /var/lib/edb/as14/data
   ```

   See [Managing Cluster > Managing Services] for more information.

1. Connect to the database server using psql command line client:

   ```sh
   psql edb
   ```

   See [Managing Your Cluster > Connecting to Your Cluster], for more information including how to use pgAdmin4 to connect to your cluster using its graphical interface.

1. Then, assign a password to the database superuser `enterprisedb`:

   ```sh
   ALTER ROLE enterprisedb IDENTIFIED BY password;
   ```

## Creating a Database

This section steps you through creating and adding data to a simple database.

1. Create a database (named hr):

   ```sh
   CREATE DATABASE hr;
   ```

1. Connect to the new database and create a table (named dept):

   ```sh
   \c hr
   CREATE TABLE public.dept (deptno numeric(2) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT dept_pk
   PRIMARY KEY, dname varchar(14) CONSTRAINT dept_dname_uq UNIQUE, loc
   varchar(13));
   ```

1. Add data to the table:

   ```sh
   INSERT INTO dept VALUES (10,'ACCOUNTING','NEW YORK');
   INSERT into dept VALUES (20,'RESEARCH','DALLAS');
   ```

1. You can use simple SQL commands to query the database and retrieve information about the data you have added to the table:

   ```sh
   SELECT * FROM dept;
   deptno |   dname    |   loc
   --------+------------+----------
   10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
   20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
   (2 rows)
   ```
