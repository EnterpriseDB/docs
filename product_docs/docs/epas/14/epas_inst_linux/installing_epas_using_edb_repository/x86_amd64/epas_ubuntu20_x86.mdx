title: Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server on Ubuntu 20.04 x86_64
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there. This page also provides installation information.

## Install the package

```shell
apt-get install edb-as<xx>-server
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of the EDB Postgres Advanced server you are installing.

To install an individual component:

```shell
apt-get install <package_name>
```

Where `package_name` can be any of the available packages from the [available package list](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux/install_details/rpm_packages/).

## Initial configuration

This section steps you through getting started with your cluster including logging in, ensuring the installation was successful, connecting to your cluster, and creating the user password.

```shell

# To work in your cluster, login as the enterprisedb user
su - enterprisedb

# Connect to the database server using the psql command line client
psql edb

# Assign a password to the database superuser the enterprisedb
ALTER ROLE enterprisedb IDENTIFIED BY password;

# Create a database (named hr)
CREATE DATABASE hr;

# Connect to the new database and create a table (named dept)
\c hr
CREATE TABLE public.dept (deptno numeric(2) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT dept_pk
PRIMARY KEY, dname varchar(14) CONSTRAINT dept_dname_uq UNIQUE, loc
varchar(13));

# Add data to the table
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (10,'ACCOUNTING','NEW YORK');
INSERT into dept VALUES (20,'RESEARCH','DALLAS');

# You can use simple SQL commands to query the database and retrieve
# information about the data you have added to the table
SELECT * FROM dept;
__OUTPUT__
deptno  |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
10      | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
20      | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
(2 rows)
```
