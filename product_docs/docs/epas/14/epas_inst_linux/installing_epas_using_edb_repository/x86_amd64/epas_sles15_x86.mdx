navTitle: SLES 15
title: Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server on SLES 15 x86_64
---

Before you begin the installation process, log in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

## Set up the repository

Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step. If you do need to set up the repository, you must register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

```shell
# Install the repository configuration and enter your EDB repository
# credentials when prompted
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access
# to SUSE repositories
zypper install SUSEConnect

# Register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
# Replace 'REGISTRATION_CODE' and 'EMAIL' with your SUSE
# registration information
SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'

# Activate the required SUSE module
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.3/x86_64

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh
```

## Install the package

```shell
zypper -n install edb-as<xx>-server
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of the EDB Postgres Advanced server you are installing.

To install an individual component:

```shell
zypper install <package_name>
```

Where `package_name` can be any of the available packages from the [available package list](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux/install_details/rpm_packages/).

## Initial configuration

This section steps you through getting started with your cluster including logging in, ensuring the installation and initial configuration was successful, connecting to your cluster, and creating the user password.

```shell
# Initialize the database cluster
PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS="-E UTF-8" /usr/edb/as14/bin/edb-as-14-setup initdb

# Start the database cluster
systemctl start edb-as-14
# To work in your cluster, login as the enterprisedb user
su - enterprisedb

# Connect to the database server using the psql command line client
psql edb

# Assign a password to the database superuser the enterprisedb
ALTER ROLE enterprisedb IDENTIFIED BY password;

# Create a database (named hr)
CREATE DATABASE hr;

# Connect to the new database and create a table (named dept)
\c hr
CREATE TABLE public.dept (deptno numeric(2) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT dept_pk
PRIMARY KEY, dname varchar(14) CONSTRAINT dept_dname_uq UNIQUE, loc
varchar(13));

# Add data to the table
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (10,'ACCOUNTING','NEW YORK');
INSERT into dept VALUES (20,'RESEARCH','DALLAS');

# You can use simple SQL commands to query the database and retrieve
# information about the data you have added to the table
SELECT * FROM dept;
__OUTPUT__
deptno  |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
10      | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
20      | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
(2 rows)
```
