To reference the types, items, and subprograms that are declared in a package specification, use the dot notation. For example:

`package_name.type_name`

`package_name.item_name`

`package_name.subprogram_name`

To invoke a function from the `emp_admin` package specification, execute the following SQL command:

```text
SELECT emp_admin.get_dept_name(10) FROM DUAL;
```

This example invokes the `get_dept_name` function declared in the package `emp_admin`. It passes the department number as an argument to the function, which returns the name of the department. The value returned is `ACCOUNTING`, which corresponds to department number `10`.
