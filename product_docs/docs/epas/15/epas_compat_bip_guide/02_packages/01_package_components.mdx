Packages consist of two main components:

-   The package specification, which is the public interface. You can reference these elements outside the package. Declare all database objects that are a part of a package in the specification.
-   Th package body, which contains the actual implementation of all the database objects declared in the package specification.

  The package body implements the specifications in the package specification. It contains implementation details and private declarations that are invisible to the application. You can debug, enhance, or replace a package body without changing the specifications. Similarly, you can change the body without recompiling the calling programs because the implementation details are invisible to the application.

## Package specification syntax

The package specification defines the user interface for a package (the API). The specification lists the functions, procedures, types, exceptions, and cursors that are visible to a user of the package.

The syntax used to define the interface for a package is:

```sql
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] PACKAGE <package_name>
  [ <authorization_clause> ]
  { IS | AS }
  [ <declaration>; ] ...
  [ <procedure_or_function_declaration> ] ...
END [ <package_name> ] ;
```

Where `authorization_clause` :=

```sql
{ AUTHID DEFINER } | { AUTHID CURRENT_USER }
```

Where `procedure_or_function_declaration` :=

```text
procedure_declaration | function_declaration
```

Where `procedure_declaration` :=

```sql
PROCEDURE proc_name [ argument_list ];
[ restriction_pragma; ]
```

Where `function_declaration` :=

```sql
FUNCTION func_name [ argument_list ]
  RETURN rettype [ DETERMINISTIC ];
[ restriction_pragma; ]
```

Where `argument_list` :=

```text
( argument_declaration [, ...] )
```

Where `argument_declaration` :=

```text
argname [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] argtype [ DEFAULT value ]
```

Where `restriction_pragma` :=

```sql
PRAGMA RESTRICT_REFERENCES(name, restrictions)
```

Where `restrictions` :=

```text
restriction [, ... ]
```

### Parameters

`package_name`

 `package_name` is an identifier assigned to the package. Each package must have a unique name in the schema.

`AUTHID DEFINER`

 If you omit the `AUTHID` clause or specify `AUTHID DEFINER`, the privileges of the package owner are used to determine access privileges to database objects.

`AUTHID CURRENT_USER`

 If you specify `AUTHID CURRENT_USER`, the privileges of the current user executing a program in the package are used to determine access privileges.

`declaration`

 `declaration` is an identifier of a public variable. You can access a public variable from outside the package using the syntax `package_name.variable`. There can be zero, one, or more public variables. Public variable definitions must come before procedure or function declarations.

 `declaration` can be any of the following:

-   Variable declaration
-   Record declaration
-   Collection declaration
-   `REF CURSOR` and cursor variable declaration
-   `TYPE` definitions for records, ollections, and `REF CURSOR`
-   Exception
-   Object variable declaration

`proc_name`

 The name of a public procedure.

`argname`

 The name of an argument. The argument is referenced by this name in the function or procedure body.

`IN` | `IN OUT` | `OUT`

 The argument mode. `IN` (the default) declares the argument for input only. `IN OUT` allows the argument to receive a value as well as return a value. `OUT` specifies the argument is for output only.

`argtype`

 The data types of an argument. An argument type can be a base data type, a copy of the type of an existing column using `%TYPE`, or a user-defined type such as a nested table or an object type. Don't specify a length for any base type. For example, specify `VARCHAR2`, not `VARCHAR2(10)`.

 Reference the type of a column by writing `tablename.columnname %TYPE`. Using this nomenclature can sometimes help make a procedure independent from changes to the definition of a table.

`DEFAULT value`

 The `DEFAULT` clause supplies a default value for an input argument if you don't supply one in the invocation. You can't specify `DEFAULT` for arguments with modes `IN OUT` or `OUT`.

`func_name`

 The name of a public function.

`rettype`

 The return data type.

`DETERMINISTIC`

 `DETERMINISTIC` is a synonym for `IMMUTABLE`. A `DETERMINISTIC` function can't modify the database and always reaches the same result when given the same argument values. It doesn't do database lookups or otherwise use information not directly present in its argument list. If you include this clause, any call of the function with all-constant arguments can be immediately replaced with the function value.

`restriction`

 The following keywords are accepted for compatibility and ignored:

 `RNDS`

 `RNPS`

 `TRUST`

 `WNDS`

 `WNPS`

## Package body syntax

Package implementation details reside in the package body. The package body can contain objects that aren't visible to the package user. EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports the following syntax for the package body:

```sql
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] PACKAGE BODY <package_name>
  { IS | AS }
  [ <private_declaration>; ] ...
  [ <procedure_or_function_definition> ] ...
  [ <package_initializer> ]
END [ <package_name> ] ;
```

Where `procedure_or_function_definition` :=

```text
procedure_definition | function_definition
```

Where `procedure_definition` :=

```sql
PROCEDURE proc_name[ argument_list ]
  [ options_list ]
  { IS | AS }
    procedure_body
  END [ proc_name ] ;
```

Where `procedure_body` :=

```sql
[ PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION; ]
[ declaration; ] [, ...]
BEGIN
  statement; [...]
[ EXCEPTION
   { WHEN exception [OR exception] [...]] THEN statement; }
   [...]
]
```

Where `function_definition` :=

```sql
FUNCTION func_name [ argument_list ]
  RETURN rettype [ DETERMINISTIC ]
  [ options_list ]
  { IS | AS }
    function_body
  END [ func_name ] ;
```

Where `function_body` :=

```sql
[ PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION; ]
[ declaration; ] [, ...]
BEGIN
  statement; [...]
[ EXCEPTION
  { WHEN exception [ OR exception ] [...] THEN statement; }
  [...]
]
```

Where `argument_list` :=

```text
( argument_declaration [, ...] )
```

Where `argument_declaration` :=

```text
argname [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] argtype [ DEFAULT value ]
```

Where `options_list` :=

```text
option [ ... ]
```

Where `option` :=

```sql
STRICT
LEAKPROOF
PARALLEL { UNSAFE | RESTRICTED | SAFE }
COST execution_cost
ROWS result_rows
SET config_param { TO value | = value | FROM CURRENT }
```

Where `package_initializer` :=

```sql
BEGIN
 statement; [...]
END;
```

### Parameters

`package_name`

 `package_name` is the name of the package for which this is the package body. An package specification with this name must already exist.

`private_declaration`

 `private_declaration` is an identifier of a private variable that any procedure or function can access in the package. There can be zero, one, or more private variables. `private_declaration` can be any of the following:

-   Variable declaration
-   Record declaration
-   Collection declaration
-   `REF CURSOR` and cursor variable declaration
-   `TYPE` definitions for records, collections, and `REF CURSORs`
-   Exception
-   Object variable declaration

`proc_name`

 The name of the procedure being created.

`PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION`

 `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` is the directive that sets the procedure as an autonomous transaction.

`declaration`

 A variable, type, `REF CURSOR`, or subprogram declaration. If you include subprogram declarations, declare them after all other variable, type, and `REF CURSOR` declarations.

`statement`

 An SPL program statement. A `DECLARE - BEGIN - END` block is considered an SPL statement unto itself. Thus, the function body can contain nested blocks.

`exception`

 An exception condition name such as `NO_DATA_FOUND, OTHERS`.

`func_name`

 The name of the function being created.

`rettype`

 The return data type, which can be any of the types listed for `argtype`. As for `argtype`, don't specify a length for `rettype`.

`DETERMINISTIC`

 Include `DETERMINISTIC` to specify for the function to always return the same result when given the same argument values. A `DETERMINISTIC` function must not modify the database.

 !!! Note
   The `DETERMINISTIC` keyword is equivalent to the PostgreSQL `IMMUTABLE` option.

 !!!Note
  If `DETERMINISTIC` is specified for a public function in the package body, you must also specify it for the function declaration in the package specification. For private functions, there's no function declaration in the package specification.

`PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION`

 `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` is the directive that sets the function as an autonomous transaction.

`argname`

 The name of a formal argument. The argument is referenced by this name in the procedure body.

`IN` | `IN OUT` | `OUT`

 The argument mode. `IN` (the default) declares the argument for input only. `IN OUT` allows the argument to receive a value as well as return a value. `OUT` specifies the argument is for output only.

`argtype`

 The data types of an argument. An argument type can be a base data type, a copy of the type of an existing column using `%TYPE`, or a user-defined type such as a nested table or an object type. Don't specify a length for any base type. For example, specify `VARCHAR2`, not `VARCHAR2(10)`.

 Reference the type of a column by writing `tablename.columnname%TYPE`. Using this nomenclature can sometimes help make a procedure independent from changes to the definition of a table.

`DEFAULT value`

 The `DEFAULT` clause supplies a default value for an input argument if you don't supply one in the procedure call. Don't specify `DEFAULT` for arguments with modes `IN OUT` or `OUT`.

The following options aren't compatible with Oracle databases. They're extensions to Oracle package syntax provided only by EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

`STRICT`

 The `STRICT` keyword specifies for the function not to execute if called with a `NULL` argument. Instead the function returns `NULL`.

`LEAKPROOF`

 The `LEAKPROOF` keyword specifies for the function not to reveal any information about arguments other than through a return value.

`PARALLEL { UNSAFE | RESTRICTED | SAFE }`

 The `PARALLEL` clause enables the use of parallel sequential scans (parallel mode). A parallel sequential scan uses multiple workers to scan a relation in parallel during a query in contrast to a serial sequential scan.

 When set to `UNSAFE`, the procedure or function can't be executed in parallel mode. The presence of such a procedure or function forces a serial execution plan. This is the default setting if you omit the `PARALLEL` clause.

 When set to `RESTRICTED`, the procedure or function can be executed in parallel mode, but the execution is restricted to the parallel group leader. If the qualification for any particular relation has anything that is parallel restricted, that relation won't be chosen for parallelism.

 When set to `SAFE`, the procedure or function can be executed in parallel mode without restriction.

`execution_cost`

 `execution_cost` specifies a positive number giving the estimated execution cost for the function, in units of `cpu_operator_cost`. If the function returns a set, this is the cost per returned row. The default is `0.0025`.

`result_rows`

 `result_rows` is the estimated number of rows for the query planner to expect the function to return. The default is `1000`.

`SET`

 Use the `SET` clause to specify a parameter value for the duration of the function:

 `config_param` specifies the parameter name.

 `value` specifies the parameter value.

 `FROM CURRENT` guarantees that the parameter value is restored when the function ends.

`package_initializer`

 The statements in the `package_initializer` are executed once per user session when the package is first referenced.

!!! Note
    The `STRICT`, `LEAKPROOF`, `PARALLEL`, `COST`, `ROWS` and `SET` keywords provide extended functionality for EDB Postgres Advanced Server. Oracle doesn't support them.
