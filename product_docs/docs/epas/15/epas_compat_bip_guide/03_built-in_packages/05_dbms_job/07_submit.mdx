title: "SUBMIT"
---

The `SUBMIT` procedure creates a job definition and stores it in the database. A job consists of:
-  A job identifier
-  The stored procedure to execute
-  When to first run the job
-  A date function that calculates the next date/time for the job to run

```sql
SUBMIT(<job> OUT BINARY_INTEGER, <what> VARCHAR2
  [, <next_date> DATE [, <interval> VARCHAR2 [, <no_parse> BOOLEAN ]]])
```

## Parameters

`job`

 Identifier assigned to the job.

`what`

 Name of the stored procedure for the job to execute.

`next_date`

 Date/time to run the job next. The default is `SYSDATE`.

`interval`

 Date function that, when evaluated, provides the next date/time for the job to run. If `interval` is set to null, then the job runs only once. Null is the default.

`no_parse`

 If set to `TRUE`, don't syntax-check the stored procedure upon job creation. Check only when the job first executes. If set to `FALSE`, check the procedure upon job creation. The default is `FALSE`.

!!! Note 
    The `no_parse` option isn't supported in this implementation of `SUBMIT()`. It's included only for compatibility.

## Examples

This example creates a job using the stored procedure `job_proc`. The job executes immediately and runs once a day after that, as set by the `interval` parameter, `SYSDATE + 1`.

```sql
DECLARE
    jobid INTEGER;
BEGIN
    DBMS_JOB.SUBMIT(jobid,'job_proc;',SYSDATE,
        'SYSDATE + 1');
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('jobid: ' || jobid);
END;

jobid: 104
```

The job immediately executes the procedure `job_proc`, populating the table `jobrun` with a row:

```sql
SELECT * FROM jobrun;
__OUTPUT__
            runtime
-------------------------------------
 job_proc run at 2007-12-11 11:43:25
(1 row)
```
