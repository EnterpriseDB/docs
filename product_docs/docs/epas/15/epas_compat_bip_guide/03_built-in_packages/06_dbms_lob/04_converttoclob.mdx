title: "CONVERTTOCLOB"
---

The `CONVERTTOCLOB` procedure converts binary data to character.

```text
CONVERTTOCLOB(<dest_lob> IN OUT CLOB, <src_blob> BLOB,
  <amount> INTEGER, <dest_offset> IN OUT INTEGER,
  <src_offset> IN OUT INTEGER, <blob_csid> NUMBER,
  <lang_context> IN OUT INTEGER, <warning> OUT INTEGER)
```

## Parameters

`dest_lob`

 `CLOB` large object locator to which to convert the binary data.

`src_blob`

 `BLOB` large object locator of the binary data to convert.

`amount`

 Number of bytes of `src_blob` to convert.

`dest_offset IN`

 Position in characters in the destination `CLOB` where you want to begin writing the source `BLOB`. The first character is offset 1.

`dest_offset OUT`

 Position in characters in the destination `CLOB` after the write operation completes. The first character is offset 1.

`src_offset IN`

 Position in bytes in the source `BLOB` where you want the conversion to the destination `CLOB` to begin. The first byte is offset 1.

`src_offset OUT`

 Position in bytes in the source `BLOB` after the conversion operation completes. The first byte is offset 1.

`blob_csid`

 Character set ID of the converted destination `CLOB`.

`lang_context IN`

 Language context for the conversion. The default value of `0` is typically used for this setting.

`lang_context OUT`

 Language context after the conversion completes.

`warning`

 `0` if the conversion was successful, `1` if a character can't be converted.
