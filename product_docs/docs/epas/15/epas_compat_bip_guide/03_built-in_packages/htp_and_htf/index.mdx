title: HTP and HTF
---

The hypertext procedures (HTP) and hypertext functions (HTF) Oracle packages generate HTML tags. Each HTP has a corresponding HTF. They generate the same HTML tags and use the same parameters, but their syntaxes differ. For example, `htp.address` and `htf.address` both generate the `<ADDRESS>` and `</ADDRESS>` tags and use the same parameters. However, they have different syntaxes: 

```
htp.address (
   cvalue         in       varchar2
   cnowrap        in       varchar2   DEFAULT NULL
   cclear         in       varchar2   DEFAULT NULL
   cattributes    in       varchar2   DEFAULT NULL);
```
```
htf.address (cvalue, cnowrap, cclear, cattributes) return varchar2;
```
