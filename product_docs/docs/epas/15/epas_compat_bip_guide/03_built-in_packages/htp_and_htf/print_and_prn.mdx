title: PRINT and PRN
---

`htp.print` generates the specified parameter as a string terminated with the `\n` newline character. The `\n` character is different from `<BR>`. 
`htp.prn` generates the specified parameter as a string. Unlike `print`, the string isn't terminated with the `\n` newline character. 

!!! Note
    `PRINT` and `PRN` operate only as HTPs.

## Syntax

```
HTP.PRINT (cbuf IN VARCHAR2);
HTP.PRINT (dbuf IN DATE);
HTP.PRINT (nbuf IN NUMBER);

HTP.PRN (cbuf IN VARCHAR2);
HTP.PRN (dbuf IN DATE);
HTP.PRN (nbuf IN NUMBER);
```

## Parameters
