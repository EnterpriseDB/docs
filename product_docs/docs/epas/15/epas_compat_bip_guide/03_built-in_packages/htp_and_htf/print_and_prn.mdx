title: PRINT and PRN
---

`htp.print` generates the specified parameter as a string terminated with the `\n` newline character. The `\n` character is different from `<BR>`. 
`htp.prn` generates the specified parameter as a string. Unlike `print`, the string isn't terminated with the `\n` newline character. 

!!! Note
    `PRINT` and `PRN` operate only as HTPs.

## Syntax

The following is the syntax for HTP:

```
htp.print (cbuf in varchar2);
htp.print (dbuf in date);
htp.print (nbuf in number);

htp.prn (cbuf in varchar2);
htp.prn (dbuf in date);
htp.prn (nbuf in number);
```

## Parameters

| Parameter | Purpose |
| --------- | -------- |
| cbuf, dbuf, and nbuf | The string to generate |
