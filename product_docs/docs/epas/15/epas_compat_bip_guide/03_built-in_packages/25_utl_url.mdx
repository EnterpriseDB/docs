The `UTL_URL` package provides a way to escape illegal and reserved characters in a URL.

| Function/procedure                                | Return type | Description                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ESCAPE(url, escape_reserved_chars, url_charset)` | `VARCHAR2`  | Use the `ESCAPE` function to escape any illegal and reserved characters in a URL. |
| `UNESCAPE(url, url_charset)`                      | `VARCHAR2`  | Use the `UNESCAPE` function to convert a URL to its original form.                  |

The `UTL_URL` package returns the `BAD_URL` exception if the call to a function includes a URL formed incorrectly.

## ESCAPE

Use the `ESCAPE` function to escape illegal and reserved characters in a URL. The signature is:

```text
ESCAPE(<url> VARCHAR2, <escape_reserved_chars> BOOLEAN,
<url_charset> VARCHAR2)
```

Reserved characters are replaced with a percent sign followed by the two-digit hex code of the ASCII value for the escaped character.

### Parameters

`url`

 `url` specifies the Uniform Resource Locator that `UTL_URL` escapes.

`escape_reserved_chars`

 `escape_reserved_chars` is a Boolean value that instructs the `ESCAPE` function to escape reserved characters as well as illegal characters:

-   If `escaped_reserved_chars` is `FALSE`, `ESCAPE` escapes only the illegal characters in the specified URL.
-   If `escape_reserved_chars` is `TRUE`, `ESCAPE` escapes both the illegal characters and the reserved characters in the specified URL.

    By default, `escape_reserved_chars` is `FALSE`.

    In a URL, legal characters are:

    | Uppercase A through Z | Lowercase a through z | 0 through 9           |
    | --------------------- | --------------------- | --------------------- |
    | asterisk (\*)         | exclamation point (!) | hyphen (-)            |
    | left parenthesis (()  | period (.)            | right parenthesis ()) |
    | single-quote (')      | tilde (~)             | underscore (\_)       |

    Some characters are legal in some parts of a URL while illegal in others. To review comprehensive rules about illegal characters, refer to RFC 2396. Some examples of characters that are considered illegal in any part of a URL are:

    | Illegal character     | Escape sequence |
    | --------------------- | --------------- |
    | a blank space ( )     | `%20`           |
    | curly braces ({ or }) | `%7b` and `%7d` |
    | hash mark (#)         | `%23`           |

    The `ESCAPE` function treats the following characters as reserved and escapes them if `escape_reserved_chars` is set to `TRUE`:

    | Reserved character | Escape sequence |
    | ------------------ | --------------- |
    | ampersand (&)      | `%5C`           |
    | at sign (@)        | `%25`           |
    | colon (:)          | `%3a`           |
    | comma (,)          | `%2c`           |
    | dollar sign ($)    | `%24`           |
    | equal sign (=)     | `%3d`           |
    | plus sign (+)      | `%2b`           |
    | question mark (?)  | `%3f`           |
    | semi-colon (;)     | `%3b`           |
    | slash (/)          | `%2f`           |

`url_charset`

 `url_charset` specifies a character set to which to convert a given character before escaping it. If `url_charset` is `NULL`, the character isn't converted. The default value of `url_charset` is `ISO-8859-1`.

### Examples

This anonymous block uses the `ESCAPE` function to escape the blank spaces in the URL:

```text
DECLARE
  result varchar2(400);
BEGIN
 result := UTL_URL.ESCAPE('http://www.example.com/Using the ESCAPE
function.html');
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(result);
END;
```

The resulting escaped URL is:

```text
http://www.example.com/Using%20the%20ESCAPE%20function.html
```

Suppose you include a value of `TRUE` for the `escape_reserved_chars` parameter when invoking the function:

```text
DECLARE
  result varchar2(400);
BEGIN
 result := UTL_URL.ESCAPE('http://www.example.com/Using the ESCAPE
function.html', TRUE);
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(result);
END;
```

The `ESCAPE` function escapes the reserved characters as well as the illegal characters in the URL:

```text
http%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com%2FUsing%20the%20ESCAPE%20function.html
```

## UNESCAPE

The `UNESCAPE` function removes escape characters added to an URL by the `ESCAPE` function, converting the URL to its original form.

The signature is:

```text
UNESCAPE(<url> VARCHAR2, <url_charset> VARCHAR2)
```

### Parameters

`url`

 `url` specifies the Uniform Resource Locator that `UTL_URL` unescapes.

`url_charset`

 After unescaping a character, the character is assumed to be in `url_charset` encoding and is converted from that encoding to database encoding before being returned. If `url_charset` is `NULL`, the character isn't converted. The default value of `url_charset` is `ISO-8859-1`.

### Examples

This anonymous block uses the `ESCAPE` function to escape the blank spaces in the URL:

```text
DECLARE
  result varchar2(400);
BEGIN
 result := 
UTL_URL.UNESCAPE('http://www.example.com/Using%20the%20UNESCAPE%20function.html');
  DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(result);
END;
```

The resulting (unescaped) URL is:

```text
http://www.example.com/Using the UNESCAPE function.html
```
