Index Advisor doesn't require configuration to generate recommendations that are available only for the rest of the current session. To store the results of multiple sessions, you must create the `index_advisor_log` table, where EDB Postgres Advanced Server stores Index Advisor recommendations. To create the `index_advisor_log` table, create the extension `index_advisor`.

When selecting a storage schema for the Index Advisor table, function, and view, keep in mind that all users that invoke Index Advisor and query the result set must have USAGE privileges on the schema. The schema must be in the search path of all users that are interacting with Index Advisor.

## Storing the results of multiple sessions

1.  Place the selected schema at the start of your `search_path` parameter. For example, suppose your search path is currently:

    ```text
    search_path=public, accounting
    ```

    If you want to create the Index Advisor objects in a schema named `advisor`, use the command:

    ```sql
    SET search_path = advisor, public, accounting;
    ```

2.  Create the `index_advisor` extension, which creates the database objects. Connect to the database as the database superuser using psql, and enter the command:

    ```sql
    # running as the database superuser using psql
    create extension index_advisor ;
    ```

    !!! Note
        If you're using Index Advisor in an earlier version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server and upgrading to version 15, then use this command to create the index_advisor extension:

        ```sql
        # running as the database superuser using psql
        create extension index_advisor version 1.1;
        ```

        This command creates the extension and links any of the old database objects to it.
    
3.  Grant privileges on the `index_advisor_log` table to all Index Advisor users. This step isn't necessary if the Index Advisor user is a superuser or the owner of these database objects.

    -   Grant `SELECT` and `INSERT` privileges on the `index_advisor_log` table to allow a user to invoke Index Advisor.
    -   Grant `DELETE` privileges on the `index_advisor_log` table to allow the specified user to delete the table contents.
    -   Grant `SELECT` privilege on the `index_recommendations` view.


## Example

This example shows creating Index Advisor database objects in a schema named `ia`. The schema is accessible to an Index Advisor user with user name `ia_user`.

```sql
# running as a enterprisedb user 
edb-psql -d edb -U enterprisedb

# running commands inside psql
CREATE SCHEMA ia;
SET search_path TO ia;
CREATE EXTENSION index_advisor;
GRANT USAGE ON SCHEMA ia TO ia_user;
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, DELETE ON index_advisor_log TO ia_user;
GRANT SELECT ON index_recommendations TO ia_user;
```

While using Index Advisor, the specified schema `(ia)` must be included in the `ia_user` `search_path` parameter.
