Index Advisor doesn't consider Index Only scans. It does consider Index scans when making recommendations.

Index Advisor ignores any computations found in the `WHERE` clause. Effectively, the index field in the recommendations isn't any kind of expression. The field is a simple column name.

Index Advisor doesn't consider inheritance when recommending hypothetical indexes. If a query references a parent table, Index Advisor doesn't make any index recommendations on child tables.

Suppose you're restoring a `pg_dump` backup file that includes the `index_advisor_log` table or any tables for which indexing recommendations were made and stored in the `index_advisor_log` table. Changes in object identifiers (OIDs) can result in "broken links" between the `index_advisor_log` table and the restored tables referenced by rows in the `index_advisor_log` table.

If you need to display the recommendations made prior to the backup, you can replace the old OIDs in the `reloid` column of the `index_advisor_log` table with the new OIDs of the referenced tables using the SQL `UPDATE` statement:

```sql
UPDATE index_advisor_log SET reloid = new_oid WHERE reloid = old_oid;
```
