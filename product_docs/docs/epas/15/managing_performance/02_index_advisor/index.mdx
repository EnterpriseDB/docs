The Index Advisor utility helps determine the columns to index to improve performance in a given workload. Index Advisor considers B-tree (single-column or composite) index types. It doesn't identify other index types, that is, GIN, GiST, and Hash, that might improve performance. Index Advisor extension is installed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server, where you can configure and use it.
