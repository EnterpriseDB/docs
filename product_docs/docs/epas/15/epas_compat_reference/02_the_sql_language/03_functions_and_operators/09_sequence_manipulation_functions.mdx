Sequence objects, which are also called sequence generators or sequences, are special single-row tables created with the `CREATE SEQUENCE` command. You usually use a sequence to generate unique identifiers for rows of a table. The sequence functions provide simple, multiuser-safe methods for obtaining successive sequence values from sequence objects.

```sql
sequence.NEXTVAL
sequence.CURRVAL
```

`sequence` is the identifier assigned to the sequence in the `CREATE SEQUENCE` command. 

`NEXTVAL`

 Advance the sequence object to its next value and return that value. This is done atomically: even if multiple sessions execute `NEXTVAL` concurrently, each safely receives a distinct sequence value.

`CURRVAL`

 Return the value most recently obtained by `NEXTVAL` for this sequence in the current session. An error is reported if `NEXTVAL` was never called for this sequence in this session. Because this is returning a session-local value, it gives a predictable answer whether or not other sessions executed `NEXTVAL` since the current session did.

If a sequence object was created with default parameters, `NEXTVAL` calls on it return successive values beginning with 1. Use special parameters in the `CREATE SEQUENCE` command for other behaviors.

!!! important
   To avoid blocking of concurrent transactions that obtain numbers from the same sequence, a `NEXTVAL` operation is never rolled back. After a value is fetched it is considered used, even if the transaction that did the `NEXTVAL` later aborts. This means that aborted transactions can leave unused "holes" in the sequence of assigned values.
