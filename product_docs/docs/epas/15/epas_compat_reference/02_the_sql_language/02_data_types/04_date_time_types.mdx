The following discussion of the date/time types assumes that the configuration parameter `edb_redwood_date` is set to `TRUE` whenever a table is created or altered.

EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports the date/time types shown in the table.

| Name                             | Storage size | Description                  | Low value        | High value      | Resolution                |
| -------------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------- | --------------- | ------------------------- |
| `DATE`                           | 8 bytes      | Date and time                | 4713 BC          | 5874897 AD      | 1 second                  |
| `INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND [(p)]`   | 12 bytes     | Period of time               | -178000000 years | 178000000 years | 1 microsecond / 14 digits |
| `INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH`         | 12 bytes     | Period of time               | -178000000 years | 178000000 years | 1 microsecond / 14 digits |
| `TIMESTAMP [(p)]`                | 8 bytes      | Date and time                | 4713 BC          | 5874897 AD      | 1 microsecond             |
| `TIMESTAMP [(p)] WITH TIME ZONE` | 8 bytes      | Date and time with time zone | 4713 BC          | 5874897 AD      | 1 microsecond             |

When `DATE` appears as the data type of a column in the data definition language (DDL) commands `CREATE TABLE` or `ALTER TABLE`, it's translated to `TIMESTAMP` at the time the table definition is stored in the database. Thus, a time component is also stored in the column along with the date.

`DATE` can appear as a data type of:

-  A variable in an SPL declaration section 
-  The data type of a formal parameter in an SPL procedure or an SPL function
-  The return type of an SPL function 

In these cases, it's always translated to `TIMESTAMP` and thus can handle a time component if present.

`TIMESTAMP` accepts an optional precision value `p` that specifies the number of fractional digits retained in the seconds field. The allowed range of `p` is from 0 to 6. The default is `6`.

When `TIMESTAMP` values are stored as double-precision floating-point numbers (the default), the effective limit of precision might be less than 6. `TIMESTAMP` values are stored as seconds before or after midnight 2000-01-01. Microsecond precision is achieved for dates within a few years of 2000-01-01, but the precision degrades for dates further away. When `TIMESTAMP` values are stored as 8-byte integers (a compile-time option), microsecond precision is available over the full range of values. However, 8-byte integer timestamps have a more limited range of dates than shown in the table: from 4713 BC up to 294276 AD.

`TIMESTAMP (p) WITH TIME ZONE` is similar to `TIMESTAMP (p)` but includes the time zone as well.

## INTERVAL types

`INTERVAL` values specify a period of time. Values of `INTERVAL` type are composed of fields that describe the value of the data. The following table lists the fields allowed in an `INTERVAL` type.

| Field name | INTERVAL values allowed                                             |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `YEAR`     | Integer value (positive or negative)                                |
| `MONTH`    | 0 through 11                                                        |
| `DAY`      | Integer value (positive or negative)                                |
| `HOUR`     | 0 through 23                                                        |
| `MINUTE`   | 0 through 59                                                        |
| `SECOND`   | 0 through 59.9(p) where 9(p) is the precision of fractional seconds |

The fields must be presented in descending order, from `YEARS` to `MONTHS` and from `DAYS` to `HOURS`, `MINUTES`, and then `SECONDS`.

EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports two `INTERVAL` types compatible with Oracle databases.

The first variation supported by EDB Postgres Advanced Server is `INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND [(p)]`. `INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND [(p)]` stores a time interval in days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

 `p` specifies the precision of the `second` field.

EDB Postgres Advanced Server interprets this value as as 1 day, 2 hours, 34 minutes, 5 seconds and 678 thousandths of a second:

 `INTERVAL '1 2:34:5.678' DAY TO SECOND(3)`

EDB Postgres Advanced Server interprets this value as 1 day and 23 hours:

 `INTERVAL '1 23' DAY TO HOUR`

EDB Postgres Advanced Server interprets this value as 2 hours and 34 minutes:

 `INTERVAL '2:34' HOUR TO MINUTE`

EDB Postgres Advanced Server interprets this value as 2 hours, 34 minutes, 56 seconds and 13 thousandths of a second. The fractional second is rounded up to 13 because of the specified precision.

 `INTERVAL '2:34:56.129' HOUR TO SECOND(2)`

The second variation supported by EDB Postgres Advanced Server that's compatible with Oracle databases is `INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH`. This variation stores a time interval in years and months.

EDB Postgres Advanced Server interprets this value as 12 years and 3 months:

 `INTERVAL '12-3' YEAR TO MONTH`

EDB Postgres Advanced Server interprets this value as 12 years and 3 months:

 `INTERVAL '456' YEAR(2)`

EDB Postgres Advanced Server interprets this value as 25 years:

 `INTERVAL '300' MONTH`


## Date/time input

Date and time input is accepted in ISO 8601 SQL-compatible format, the Oracle default `dd-MON-yy` format, as well as a number of other formats provided that there's no ambiguity as to which component is the year, month, and day. However, we strongly recommend using the `TO_DATE` function to avoid ambiguities.

Enclose any date or time literal input in single quotes, like text strings. The following SQL standard syntax is also accepted:

```text
type 'value'
```

`type` is either `DATE` or `TIMESTAMP`.

`value` is a date/time text string.

### Dates

The following block shows some possible input formats for dates, all of which equate to January 8, 1999:

```text
Example
January 8, 1999
1999-01-08
1999-Jan-08
Jan-08-1999
08-Jan-1999
08-Jan-99
Jan-08-99
19990108
990108
```

You can assign the date values to a `DATE` or `TIMESTAMP` column or variable. The hour, minute, and seconds fields is set to zero if you don't append the date value with a time value.

### Times

Some examples of the time component of a date or time stamp are shown in the table.

| Example        | Description                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `04:05:06.789` | ISO 8601                                   |
| `04:05:06`     | ISO 8601                                   |
| `04:05`        | ISO 8601                                   |
| `040506`       | ISO 8601                                   |
| `04:05 AM`     | Same as 04:05; AM does not affect value    |
| `04:05 PM`     | Same as 16:05; input hour must be &lt;= 12 |

### Time stamps

Valid input for time stamps consists of a concatenation of a date and a time. You can format the date portion of the time according to any of the examples shown in [Dates](#dates). The time portion of the time stamp can be formatted according to any of examples shown in the table in [Times](#times).

This example shows a time stamp that follows the Oracle default format:

 `08-JAN-99 04:05:06`

This example shows a time stamp that follows the ISO 8601 standard:

 `1999-01-08 04:05:06`

## Date/time output

The default output format of the date/time types is either:

-  (`dd-MON-yy`), referred to as the *Redwood date style*, compatible with Oracle databases 
-  (`yyyy-mm-dd`) referred to as the ISO 8601 format

The format you use depends on the application interface to the database. Applications that use JDBC, such as SQL Interactive, always present the date in ISO 8601 form. Other applications such as PSQL present the date in Redwood form.

The following table shows examples of the output formats for the two styles: Redwood and ISO 8601.

| Description           | Example               |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| Redwood style         | `31-DEC-05 07:37:16`  |
| ISO 8601/SQL standard | `1997-12-17 07:37:16` |

## Internals

EDB Postgres Advanced Server uses Julian dates for all date/time calculations. Julian dates correctly predict or calculate any date after 4713 BC based on the assumption that the length of the year is 365.2425 days.
