<div id="comments" class="registered_link"></div>

A comment is an arbitrary sequence of characters beginning with double dashes and extending to the end of the line, for example:

`-- This is a standard SQL comment`

Alternatively, you can use C-style block comments:

```text
/* multiline comment
* block
*/
```

The comment begins with /\* and extends to the matching occurrence of \*/.
