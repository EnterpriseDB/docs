EDB\*Loader is a high-performance bulk data loader that provides an interface compatible with Oracle databases for EDB Postgres Advanced Server. The EDB\*Loader command line utility loads data from an input source, typically a file, into one or more tables using a subset of the parameters offered by Oracle SQL\*Loader.

EDB\*Loader features include:

-   Support for the Oracle SQL\*Loader data loading methods (conventional path load, direct path load, and parallel direct path load)
-   Syntax for control file directives compatible with Oracle SQL\*Loader
-   Input data with delimiter-separated or fixed-width fields
-   Bad file for collecting rejected records
-   Loading of multiple target tables
-   Discard file for collecting records that don't meet the selection criteria of any target table
-   Log file for recording the EDB\*Loader session and any error messages
-   Data loading from standard input and remote loading, particularly useful for large data sources on remote hosts

!!! Note
    The following are important version compatibility restrictions between the EDB\*Loader client and the database server.

    -   When you invoke the EDB\*Loader program (called `edbldr`), you pass in parameters and directive information to the database server. We strongly recommend that you use the version 14 EDB\*Loader client (the edbldr program supplied with EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14) to load data only into version 14 of the database server. In general, use the same version for the EDB\*Loader client and database server.

    -   Using EDB\*Loader with connection poolers such as PgPool-II and PgBouncer isn't supported. EDB\*Loader must connect directly to EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 14. Alternatively, the following are some of the commands you can use for loading data through connection poolers:

        ```shell
        psql \copy
        jdbc copyIn
        psycopg2 copy_from
        ```

<div id="data_loading_methods" class="registered_link"></div>

## Data loading methods

As with Oracle SQL\*Loader, EDB\*Loader supports three data loading methods:

-   Conventional path load
-   Direct path load
-   Parallel direct path load

Conventional path load is the default method used by EDB\*Loader. Use basic insert processing to add rows to the table.

The advantage of a conventional path load is that table constraints and database objects defined on the table are enforced during a conventional path load. Table constraints and database objects include primary keys, not null constraints, check constraints, unique indexes, foreign key constraints, triggers, and so on. 

One exception is that the EDB Postgres Advanced Server rules defined on the table aren't enforced. EDB\*Loader can load tables on which rules are defined. However, the rules aren't executed. As a consequence, you can't load partitioned tables implemented using rules with EDB\*Loader.

!!! Note
    Create EDB Postgres Advanced Server rules using the `CREATE RULE` command. EDB Postgres Advanced Server rules aren't the same database objects as rules and rule sets used in Oracle.

EDB\*Loader also supports direct path loads. A direct path load is faster than a conventional path load but requires removing most types of constraints and triggers from the table. For more information, see [Direct path load](#direct-path-load).

EDB\*Loader supports parallel direct path loads. A parallel direct path load provides even greater performance improvement by permitting multiple EDB\*Loader sessions to run simultaneously to load a single table. For more information, see [Parallel direct path load](#parallel-direct-path-load).

<div id="general_usage" class="registered_link"></div>

## General usage

EDB\*Loader can load data files with either delimiter-separated or fixed-width fields in single-byte or multibyte character sets. The delimiter can be a string consisting of one or more single-byte or multibyte characters. Data file encoding and the database encoding can differ. Character set conversion of the data file to the database encoding is supported.

Each EDB\*Loader session runs as a single, independent transaction. If an error occurs during the EDB\*Loader session that aborts the transaction, all changes made during the session are rolled back.

Generally, formatting errors in the data file don't result in an aborted transaction. Instead, the badly formatted records are written to a text file called the *bad file*. The reason for the error is recorded in the *log file*.

Records causing database integrity errors result in an aborted transaction and rollback. As with formatting errors, the record causing the error is written to the bad file and the reason is recorded in the log file.

!!! Note
    EDB\*Loader differs from Oracle SQL\*Loader in that a database integrity error results in a rollback in EDB\*Loader. In Oracle SQL\*Loader, only the record causing the error is rejected. Records that were previously inserted into the table are retained, and loading continues after the rejected record.

The following are examples of types of formatting errors that don't abort the transaction:

-   Attempt to load non-numeric value into a numeric column
-   Numeric value too large for a numeric column
-   Character value too long for the maximum length of a character column
-   Attempt to load improperly formatted date value into a date column

The following are examples of types of database errors that abort the transaction and result in the rollback of all changes made in the EDB\*Loader session:

-   Violating a unique constraint such as a primary key or unique index
-   Violating a referential integrity constraint
-   Violating a check constraint
-   Error thrown by a trigger fired as a result of inserting rows

<div id="building_the_edb_loader_control_file" class="registered_link"></div>

## Building the EDB\*Loader control file

When you invoke EDB\*Loader, the list of arguments provided must include the name of a control file. The control file includes the instructions that EDB\*Loader uses to load the tables from the input data file. The control file includes information such as:

-   The name of the input data file containing the data to load
-   The name of the tables to load from the data file
-   Names of the columns in the tables and their corresponding field placement in the data file
-   Specification of whether the data file uses a delimiter string to separate the fields or if the fields occupy fixed column positions
-   Optional selection criteria to choose the records from the data file to load into a given table
-   The name of the file that collects illegally formatted records
-   The name of the discard file that collects records that don't meet the selection criteria of any table

The syntax for the EDB\*Loader control file is:

```sql
[ OPTIONS (<param=value> [, <param=value> ] ...) ]
LOAD DATA
  [ CHARACTERSET <charset> ]
  [ INFILE '{ <data_file> | <stdin> }' ]
  [ BADFILE '<bad_file>' ]
  [ DISCARDFILE '<discard_file>' ]
  [ { DISCARDMAX | DISCARDS } <max_discard_recs> ]
[ INSERT | APPEND | REPLACE | TRUNCATE ]
[ PRESERVE BLANKS ]
{ INTO TABLE <target_table>
  [ WHEN <field_condition> [ AND <field_condition> ] ...]
  [ FIELDS TERMINATED BY '<termstring>'
    [ OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '<enclstring>' ] ]
  [ RECORDS DELIMITED BY '<delimstring>' ]
  [ TRAILING NULLCOLS ]
   (<field_def> [, <field_def> ] ...)
} ...
```

Where `field_def` defines a field in the specified `data_file`. The field describes the location, data format, or value of the data to insert into `column_name` of `target_table`. The syntax of `field_def` is:

```sql
<column_name> {
  CONSTANT <val> |
  FILLER [ POSITION (<start:end>) ] [ <fieldtype> ] |
  BOUNDFILLER [ POSITION (<start:end>) ] [ <fieldtype> ] |
  [ POSITION (<start:end>) ] [ <fieldtype> ]
  [ NULLIF <field_condition> [ AND <field_condition> ] ...]
  [ PRESERVE BLANKS ] [ "<expr>" ]
}
```

Where `fieldtype` is one of:

```sql
CHAR [(<length>)] | DATE [(<length>)] | TIMESTAMP [(<length>)] [ "<datemask>" ] | 
INTEGER EXTERNAL [(<length>)] |
FLOAT EXTERNAL [(<length>)] | DECIMAL EXTERNAL [(<length>)] |
ZONED EXTERNAL [(<length>)] | ZONED [(<precision> [,<scale>])]
```

### Description

The specification of `data_file`, `bad_file`, and `discard_file` can include the full directory path or a relative directory path to the file name. If the file name is specified alone or with a relative directory path, the file is then assumed to exist, in the case of `data_file`, relative to the current working directory from which you invoke `edbldr. In the case of `bad_file` or `discard_file`, it's created.

You can include references to environment variables in the EDB\*Loader control file when referring to a directory path or file name. Environment variable references are formatted differently on Windows systems than on Linux systems:

-   On Linux, the format is `$ENV_VARIABLE` or `${ENV_VARIABLE}`.
-   On Windows, the format is `%ENV_VARIABLE%`.

Where `ENV_VARIABLE` is the environment variable that's set to the directory path or file name.

Set the `EDBLDR_ENV_STYLE` environment variable to interpret environment variable references as Windows-styled references or Linux-styled references regardless of the operating system on which EDB\*Loader resides. You can use this environment variable to create portable control files for EDB\*Loader.

-   On a Windows system, set `EDBLDR_ENV_STYLE` to `linux` or `unix` to recognize Linux-style references in the control file.
-   On a Linux system, set `EDBLDR_ENV_STYLE` to `windows` to recognize Windows-style references in the control file.

The operating system account `enterprisedb` must have read permission on the directory and file specified by `data_file`.

The operating system account enterprisedb must have write permission on the directories where `bad_file` and `discard_file` are written.

!!! Note
    The file names for `data_file`, `bad_file`, and `discard_file` must have extensions `.dat`, `.bad`, and `.dsc`, respectively. If the provided file name doesn't have an extension, EDB\*Loader assumes the actual file name includes the appropriate extension.

Suppose an EDB\*Loader session results in data format errors, the `BADFILE` clause isn't specified, and the BAD parameter isn't given on the command line when `edbldr` is invoked. In this case, a bad file is created with the name `control_file_base.bad` in the directory from which `edbldr` is invoked. `control_file_base` is the base name of the control file used in the `edbldr` session.

If all of the following conditions are true, the discard file isn't created even if the EDB\*Loader session results in discarded records:

-   The `DISCARDFILE` clause for specifying the discard file isn't included in the control file.
-   The `DISCARD` parameter for specifying the discard file isn't included on the command line.
-   The `DISCARDMAX` clause for specifying the maximum number of discarded records isn't included in the control file.
-   The `DISCARDS` clause for specifying the maximum number of discarded records isn't included in the control file.
-   The `DISCARDMAX` parameter for specifying the maximum number of discarded records isn't included on the command line.

Suppose you don't specify the `DISCARDFILE` clause and the `DISCARD` parameter for explicitly specifying the discard file name, but you do specify `DISCARDMAX` or `DISCARDS`. In this case, the EDB\*Loader session creates a discard file using the data file name with an extension of `.dsc`.

!!! Note
    The keywords `DISCARD` and `DISCARDS` differ. `DISCARD` is an EDB\*Loader command line parameter used to specify the discard file name (see [General usage](#general-usage)). `DISCARDS` is a clause of the `LOAD DATA` directive that can appear only in the control file. Keywords `DISCARDS` and `DISCARDMAX` provide the same functionality of specifying the maximum number of discarded records allowed before terminating the EDB\*Loader session. Records loaded into the database before terminating the EDB\*Loader session due to exceeding the `DISCARDS` or `DISCARDMAX` settings are kept in the database. They aren't rolled back.

Specifying one of `INSERT`, `APPEND`, `REPLACE`, or `TRUNCATE` establishes the default action for adding rows to target tables. The default action is `INSERT`.

If you specify the `FIELDS TERMINATED BY` clause, then you can't specify the `POSITION (start:end)` clause for any `field_def`. Alternatively, if you don't specify the `FIELDS TERMINATED BY` clause, then every `field_def` must contain the `POSITION (start:end)` clause, the `fieldtype(length)` clause, or the `CONSTANT` clause.

### Parameters

`OPTIONS param=value`

 Use the `OPTIONS` clause to specify `param=value` pairs that represent an EDB\*Loader directive. If you specify a parameter in the `OPTIONS` clause and on the command line when `edbldr` is invoked, the command line setting takes effect.

 Specify one or more of the following parameter/value pairs:

-   `DIRECT= { FALSE | TRUE }`

    With `DIRECT` set to `TRUE`, EDB\*Loader performs a direct path load instead of a conventional path load. The default value of `DIRECT` is `FALSE`.

    Don't set `DIRECT=true` when loading the data into a replicated table. If you're using EDB\*Loader to load data into a replicated table and set `DIRECT=true`, indexes might omit rows that are in a table or can potentially contain references to rows that were deleted. Direct inserts to load data into replicated tables aren't supported.

    For information on direct path loads see, [Direct path load](#direct-path-load).

-   `ERRORS=error_count`

    `error_count` specifies the number of errors permitted before aborting the EDB\*Loader session. The default is `50`.

-   `FREEZE= { FALSE | TRUE }`

    Set `FREEZE` to `TRUE` to copy the data with the rows `frozen`. A tuple guaranteed to be visible to all current and future transactions is marked as frozen to prevent transaction ID wraparound. For more information about frozen tuples, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/routine-vacuuming.html).

    You must specify a data-loading type of `TRUNCATE` in the control file when using the `FREEZE` option. `FREEZE` isn't supported for direct loading.

    By default, `FREEZE` is `FALSE`.

-   `PARALLEL= { FALSE | TRUE }`

    Set `PARALLEL` to `TRUE` to indicate that this EDB\*Loader session is one of a number of concurrent EDB\*Loader sessions participating in a parallel direct path load. The default value of `PARALLEL` is `FALSE`.

    When `PARALLEL` is `TRUE`, you must also set the `DIRECT` parameter to `TRUE`. For more information about parallel direct path loads, see [Parallel direct path load](#parallel-direct-path-load).

-   `ROWS=n`

    `n` specifies the number of rows that EDB\*Loader commits before loading the next set of `n` rows.

    If EDB\*Loader encounters an invalid row during a load in which the `ROWS` parameter is specified, those rows committed prior to encountering the error remain in the destination table.

-   `SKIP=skip_count`

    `skip_count` specifies the number of records at the beginning of the input data file to skip before loading begins. The default is `0`.

-   `SKIP_INDEX_MAINTENANCE={ FALSE | TRUE }`

    If `SKIP_INDEX_MAINTENANCE` is `TRUE`, index maintenance isn't performed as part of a direct path load, and indexes on the loaded table are marked as invalid. The default value of `SKIP_INDEX_MAINTENANCE` is `FALSE`.

    !!! Note
        During a parallel direct path load, target table indexes aren't updated. They are marked as invalid after the load is complete.

    You can use the `REINDEX` command to rebuild an index. For more information about the `REINDEX` command, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-reindex.html).

`charset`

 Use the `CHARACTERSET` clause to identify the character set encoding of `data_file`, where `charset` is the character set name. This clause is required if the data file encoding differs from the control file encoding. The control file encoding must always be in the encoding of the client where `edbldr` is invoked.

 Examples of `charset` settings are `UTF8`, `SQL_ASCII`, and `SJIS`.

 For more information about client-to-database character-set conversion, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/multibyte.html).

`data_file`

 File containing the data to load into `target_table`. Each record in the data file corresponds to a row to insert into `target_table`.

 If you don't include an extension in the file name, EDB\*Loader assumes the file has an extension of `.dat`, for example, `mydatafile.dat`.

 !!! Note
    If you specify the `DATA` parameter on the command line when invoking `edbldr`, the file given by the command line `DATA` parameter is used instead.

 If you omit the `INFILE` clause and the command line `DATA` parameter, then the data file name is assumed to be the same as the control file name but with the extension `.dat`.

`stdin`

 Specify `stdin` (all lowercase letters) if you want to use standard input to pipe the data to load directly to EDB\*Loader. This technique is useful for data sources generating a large number of records to load.

`bad_file`

 A file that receives `data_file` records that can't load due to errors. The bad file is generated for collecting rejected or bad records.

 For EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 12 and later, a bad file is generated only if there are any bad or rejected records. However, if an existing bad file has the same name and location, and no bad records are generated after invoking a new version of `edbldr`, the existing bad file remains intact.

 If you don't include an extension in the file name, EDB\*Loader assumes the file has an extension of `.bad`, for example, `mybadfile.bad`.

 !!! Note
    If you specify the `BAD` parameter on the command line when invoking `edbldr`, the file given with the command line `BAD` parameter is used instead.

`discard_file`

 File that receives input data records that aren't loaded into any table. This input data records are discarded because none of the selection criteria are met for tables with the `WHEN` clause and there are no tables without a `WHEN` clause. All records meet the selection criteria of a table without a `WHEN` clause.

 If you don't include an extension with the file name, EDB\*Loader assumes the file has an extension of `.dsc`, for example, `mydiscardfile.dsc`.

 !!! Note
    If you specify the `DISCARD` parameter on the command line when invoking `edbldr`, the file given with the command line `DISCARD` parameter is used instead.

`{ DISCARDMAX | DISCARDS } max_discard_recs`

 Maximum number of discarded records that the input data records can encounter before terminating the EDB\*Loader session. You can use either keyword `DISCARDMAX` or `DISCARDS` preceding the integer value specified by `max_discard_recs`.

 For example, if `max_discard_recs` is `0`, then the EDB\*Loader session is terminated when a first discarded record is encountered. If `max_discard_recs` is `1`, then the EDB\*Loader session is terminated when a second discarded record is encountered.

 When the EDB\*Loader session is terminated due to exceeding `max_discard_recs`, prior input data records that were loaded into the database are retained. They aren't rolled back.

`INSERT | APPEND | REPLACE | TRUNCATE`

 Specifies how to load data into the target tables. Specifying one of `INSERT`, `APPEND`, `REPLACE`, or `TRUNCATE` establishes the default action for all tables, overriding the default of `INSERT`.

-   `INSERT`

    Data is loaded into an empty table. EDB\*Loader throws an exception and doesn't load any data if the table isn't initially empty.

    !!! Note
        If the table contains rows, you must use the `TRUNCATE` command to empty the table before invoking EDB\*Loader. EDB\*Loader throws an exception if you use the `DELETE` command to empty the table instead of the `TRUNCATE` command. Oracle SQL\*Loader allows you to empty the table by using either the `DELETE` or `TRUNCATE` command.

-   `APPEND`

    Data is added to any existing rows in the table. The table also can be empty initially.

-   `REPLACE`

    The `REPLACE` keyword and `TRUNCATE` keywords are functionally identical. The table is truncated by EDB\*Loader before loading the new data.

    !!! Note
        Delete triggers on the table aren't fired as a result of the `REPLACE` operation.

-   `TRUNCATE`

    The table is truncated by EDB\*Loader before loading the new data. Delete triggers on the table aren't fired as a result of the `TRUNCATE` operation.

`PRESERVE BLANKS`

 The `PRESERVE BLANKS` option works only with the `OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY` clause. It retains leading and trailing whitespaces for both delimited and predetermined size fields. 
 
 In case of `NO PRESERVE BLANKS`, if the fields are delimited, then only leading whitespaces are omitted. If any trailing whitespaces are present, they are left intact. In the case of predetermined-sized fields with `NO PRESERVE BLANKS`, the trailing whitespaces are omitted. Any leading whitespaces are left intact. 

 !!! Note
    If you don't explicitly provide `PRESERVE BLANKS` or `NO PRESERVE BLANKS`, then the behavior defaults to `NO PRESERVE BLANKS`. This option doesn't work for ideographic whitespaces. 
 
`target_table`

 Name of the table into which to load data. The table name can be schema-qualified (for example, `enterprisedb.emp`). The specified target can't be a view.

`field_condition`

 Conditional clause taking the following form:

```text
[ ( ] { (start:end) | column_name } { = | != | <> } 'val' [ ) ]
```

 This conditional clause is used for the `WHEN` clause, which is part of the `INTO TABLE target_table` clause. It's also used for the `NULLIF` clause, which is part of the field definition denoted as `field_def` in the syntax diagram.

 `start` and `end` are positive integers specifying the column positions in `data_file` that mark the beginning and end of a field to compare with the constant `val`. The first character in each record begins with a `start` value of `1`.

 `column_name` specifies the name assigned to a field definition of the data file as defined by `field_def` in the syntax diagram.

 Using (`start`:`end`) or `column_name` defines the portion of the record in `data_file` to compare with the value specified by `val` to evaluate as either true or false.

 All characters used in the `field_condition` text (particularly in the `val` string) must be valid in the database encoding. For performing data conversion, EDB\*Loader first converts the characters in `val` string to the database encoding and then to the data file encoding.

 In the `WHEN field_condition [ AND field_condition ]` clause, if all such conditions evaluate to `TRUE` for a given record, then EDB\*Loader attempts to insert that record into `target_table`. If the insert operation fails, the record is written to `bad_file`.

 Suppose, for a given record, that none of the `WHEN` clauses evaluate to `TRUE` for all `INTO TABLE` clauses. The record is written to `discard_file` if a discard file was specified for the EDB\*Loader session.

 See the description of the `NULLIF` clause in this parameters list for the effect of `field_condition` on this clause.

`termstring`

 String of one or more characters that separates each field in `data_file`. The characters can be single byte or multibyte. However, they must be valid in the database encoding. Two consecutive appearances of `termstring` with no intervening character results in the corresponding column being set to null.

`enclstring`

 String of one or more characters used to enclose a field value in `data_file`. The characters can be single byte or multibyte, However, they must be valid in the database encoding. Use `enclstring` on fields where `termstring` appears as part of the data.

`delimstring`

 String of one or more characters that separates each record in `data_file`. The characters can be single byte or multibyte. However, they must be valid in the database encoding. Two consecutive appearances of `delimstring` with no intervening character results in no corresponding row being loaded into the table. You must also terminate the last record (that is, the end of the data file) with the `delimstring` characters. Otherwise, the final record isn't loaded into the table.

 !!! Note
    The `RECORDS DELIMITED BY 'delimstring'` clause isn't compatible with Oracle databases.

`TRAILING NULLCOLS`

 If you specify `TRAILING NULLCOLS`, then the columns in the column list for which there's no data in `data_file` for a given record are set to null when the row is inserted. This option applies only to one or more consecutive columns at the end of the column list.

 If fields are omitted at the end of a record and you don't specify `TRAILING NULLCOLS`, EDB\*Loader assumes the record contains formatting errors and writes it to the bad file.

`column_name`

 Name of a column in `target_table` into which to insert a field value defined by `field_def`. If the field definition includes the `FILLER` or `BOUNDFILLER` clause, then `column_name` isn't required as the name of a column in the table. It can be any identifier name since the `FILLER` and `BOUNDFILLER` clauses prevent loading the field data into a table column.

`CONSTANT val`

 Specifies a constant that's type-compatible with the column data type to which it's assigned in a field definition. You can use single or double quotes around `val`. If `val` contains white space, then you must use quotation marks around it.

 The use of the `CONSTANT` clause determines the value to assign to a column in each inserted row. No other clause can appear in the same field definition.

 If you use the `TERMINATED BY` clause to delimit the fields in `data_file`, there must be no delimited field in `data_file` corresponding to any field definition with a `CONSTANT` clause. In other words, EDB\*Loader assumes there's no field in `data_file` for any field definition with a `CONSTANT` clause.

`FILLER`

 Specifies not to load the data in the field defined by the field definition into the associated column if the identifier of the field definition is an actual column name in the table. In this case, the column is set to null. Use of the `FILLER` or `BOUNDFILLER` clause is the only circumstance in which you don't have to identify the field definition with an actual column name.

 Unlike the `BOUNDFILLER` clause, you can't reference an identifier defined with the `FILLER` clause in a SQL expression. See the discussion of the `expr` parameter.

`BOUNDFILLER`

 Specifies not to load the data in the field defined by the field definition into the associated column if the identifier of the field definition is an actual column name in the table. In this case, the column is set to null. Use of the `FILLER` or `BOUNDFILLER` clause is the only circumstance in which you don't have to identify the field definition with an actual column name.

 Unlike the `FILLER` clause, a SQL expression can reference an identifier defined with the `BOUNDFILLER` clause. See the discussion of the `expr` parameter.

`POSITION (start:end)`

 Defines the location of the field in a record in a fixed-width field data file. `start` and `end` are positive integers. The first character in the record has a start value of `1`.

```sql
CHAR [(<length>)] | DATE [(<length>)] | TIMESTAMP [(<length>)] [ "<datemask>" ] | 
INTEGER EXTERNAL [(<length>)] |
FLOAT EXTERNAL [(<length>)] | DECIMAL EXTERNAL [(<length>)] |
ZONED EXTERNAL [(<length>)] | ZONED [(<precision>[,<scale>])]
```

 Field type that describes the format of the data field in `data_file`.

 !!! Note 
    Specifying a field type is optional for descriptive purposes and has no effect on whether EDB\*Loader successfully inserts the data in the field into the table column. Successful loading depends on the compatibility of the column data type and the field value. For example, a column with data type `NUMBER(7,2)` successfully accepts a field containing `2600`. However, if the field contains a value such as `26XX`, the insertion fails, and the record is written to `bad_file`.

`ZONED` data is not human readable. `ZONED` data is stored in an internal format where each digit is encoded in a separate nibble/nybble/4-bit field. In each `ZONED` value, the last byte contains a single digit in the high-order 4 bits and the sign in the low-order 4 bits.

`length`

 Specifies the length of the value to load into the associated column.

 If you specify the `POSITION` (`start`:`end`) clause with a `fieldtype(length)` clause, then the ending position of the field is overridden by the specified `length` value. That is, the length of the value to load into the column is determined by the `length` value beginning at the `start` position and not by the `end` position of the `POSITION` (`start`:`end`) clause. Thus, the value to load into the column might be shorter than the field defined by `POSITION` (`start`:`end`). Or, it might go beyond the end position, depending on the specified `length` size.

 If you specify the `FIELDS TERMINATED BY 'termstring'` clause as part of the `INTO TABLE` clause, and a field definition contains the `fieldtype(length)` clause, then a record is accepted. However, the specified `length` values must be greater than or equal to the field lengths as determined by the `termstring` characters enclosing all such fields of the record. If the specified `length` value is less than a field length as determined by the enclosing `termstring` characters for any such field, then the record is rejected.

 If you don't specify the `FIELDS TERMINATED BY 'termstring'` clause, and you don't include the `POSITION` (`start`:`end`) clause with a field containing the `fieldtype(length)` clause, then the starting position of this field begins with the next character following the ending position of the preceding field. The ending position of the preceding field is either:

 -  The end of its `length` value if the preceding field contains the `fieldtype(length)` clause
 -  Its `end` parameter if the field contains the `POSITION` (`start`:`end`) clause without the `fieldtype(length)` clause

`precision`

 Use `precision` to specify the length of the `ZONED` value.

 If the `precision` value specified for `ZONED` conflicts with the length calculated by the server based on information provided with the `POSITION` clause, EDB\*Loader uses the value specified for `precision`.

`scale`

 Specifies the number of digits to the right of the decimal point in a `ZONED` value.

`datemask`

 Specifies the ordering and abbreviation of the day, month, and year components of a date field.

 !!! Note
    If you specify the `DATE` or `TIMESTAMP` field type with a SQL expression for the column, then you must specify `datemask` after `DATE` or `TIMESTAMP` and before the SQL expression. See the discussion of the `expr` parameter.

 When using the `TIMESTAMP` field datatype, if you specify `time_stamp timestamp "yyyymmddhh24miss"`, the `datemask` is converted to the SQL expression. However, in the case of `time_stamp timestamp "select to_timestamp(:time_stamp, 'yyyymmddhh24miss')"`, EDB\*Loader can't differentiate between datemask and the SQL expression. It treats the third field (SQL expression in the example) as datemask and prepares the SQL expression, which isn't valid. Where:
 
-   `first field` specifies the column name. 
-   `second field` specifies the datatype.
-   `third field` specifies the datemask.

If you want to provide an SQL expression, then a workaround is to specify the datemask and SQL expression using the `TO_CHAR` function as:
 
 ```sql
 time_stamp timestamp "yyyymmddhh24miss" "to_char(to_timestamp(:time_stamp, 'yyyymmddhh24miss'), 'yyyymmddhh24miss')"
 ```

`NULLIF field_condition [ AND field_condition ] ...`

 See the description of `field_condition` in this parameter list for the syntax of `field_condition`.

 If all field conditions evaluate to `TRUE`, then the column identified by `column_name` in the field definition is set to null. If any field condition evaluates to `FALSE`, then the column is set to the appropriate value as normally occurs according to the field definition.

`PRESERVE BLANKS`

 The `PRESERVE BLANKS` option works only with the `OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY` clause and retains leading and trailing whitespaces for both delimited and predetermined size fields. 
 
 In case of `NO PRESERVE BLANKS`, if the fields are delimited, then only leading whitespaces are omitted. If any trailing whitespaces are present, they are left intact. In the case of predetermined-sized fields with `NO PRESERVE BLANKS`, the trailing whitespaces are omitted, and any leading whitespaces are left intact. 

 !!! Note
    If you don't provide `PRESERVE BLANKS` or `NO PRESERVE BLANKS`, then the behavior defaults to `NO PRESERVE BLANKS`. This option doesn't work for ideographic whitespaces. 
 
`expr`

 A SQL expression returning a scalar value that's type-compatible with the column data type to which it's assigned in a field definition. Use double quotes around `expr`. `expr` can contain a reference to any column in the field list except for fields with the `FILLER` clause. Prefix the column name using a colon (`:`).

 `expr` can also consist of a SQL `SELECT` statement. If you use a `SELECT` statement:

-   Enclose the `SELECT` statement in parentheses, that is, `(SELECT ...)`.
-   The select list must consist of one expression following the `SELECT` keyword.
-   The result set must not return more than one row. If no rows are returned, then the returned value of the resulting expression is null.

    The following is the syntax for a `SELECT` statement:

    ```sql
    "(SELECT <expr> [ FROM <table_list> [ WHERE <condition> ] ])"
    ```

    !!! Note
        Omitting the `FROM table_list` clause isn't compatible with Oracle databases. If you don't need to specify any tables, using the `FROM DUAL` clause is compatible with Oracle databases.

## EDB\* Loader control file examples

The following are some examples of control files and their corresponding data files.

### Delimiter-separated field data file

This control file uses a delimiter-separated data file that appends rows to the `emp` table. The `APPEND` clause is used to allow inserting additional rows into the `emp` table.


```sql
LOAD DATA
  INFILE 'emp.dat'
    BADFILE 'emp.bad'
  APPEND
  INTO TABLE emp
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
    TRAILING NULLCOLS
  (
    empno,
    ename,
    job,
    mgr,
    hiredate,
    sal,
    deptno,
    comm
  )
```

The following is the corresponding delimiter-separated data file:

```sql
9101,ROGERS,CLERK,7902,17-DEC-10,1980.00,20
9102,PETERSON,SALESMAN,7698,20-DEC-10,2600.00,30,2300.00
9103,WARREN,SALESMAN,7698,22-DEC-10,5250.00,30,2500.00
9104,"JONES, JR.",MANAGER,7839,02-APR-09,7975.00,20
```

The use of the `TRAILING NULLCOLS` clause allows you to omit the last field supplying the `comm` column from the first and last records. The `comm` column is set to null for the rows inserted from these records.

Double quotation marks surround the value `JONES, JR.` in the last record since the comma delimiter character is part of the field value.

This query displays the rows added to the table after the EDB\*Loader session:

```sql
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno > 9100;
__OUTPUT__
 empno| ename     | job     | mgr|   hiredate        | sal   | comm   |deptno
------+-----------+---------+----+-------------------+-------+--------+------
  9101| ROGERS    | CLERK   |7902| 17-DEC-10 00:00:00|1980.00|        |  20
  9102| PETERSON  | SALESMAN|7698| 20-DEC-10 00:00:00|2600.00| 2300.00|  30
  9103| WARREN    | SALESMAN|7698| 22-DEC-10 00:00:00|5250.00| 2500.00|  30
  9104| JONES, JR.| MANAGER |7839| 02-APR-09 00:00:00|7975.00|        |  20
(4 rows)
```

### Fixed-width field data file

This control file loads the same rows into the `emp` table. It uses a data file containing fixed-width fields. The `FIELDS TERMINATED BY` and `OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY` clauses are absent. Instead, each field includes the `POSITION` clause.

```sql
LOAD DATA
  INFILE 'emp_fixed.dat'
    BADFILE 'emp_fixed.bad'
  APPEND
  INTO TABLE emp
    TRAILING NULLCOLS
  (
    empno POSITION (1:4),
    ename POSITION (5:14),
    job POSITION (15:23),
    mgr POSITION (24:27),
    hiredate POSITION (28:38),
    sal POSITION (39:46),
    deptno POSITION (47:48),
    comm POSITION (49:56)
  )
```

The following is the corresponding data file containing fixed-width fields:

```sql
9101ROGERS    CLERK    790217-DEC-10    1980.0020
9102PETERSON  SALESMAN 769820-DEC-10    2600.0030 2300.00
9103WARREN    SALESMAN 769822-DEC-10    5250.0030 2500.00
9104JONES, JR.MANAGER  783902-APR-09    7975.0020
```

### Single physical record data file – RECORDS DELIMITED BY clause

This control file loads the same rows into the `emp` table but uses a data file with one physical record. Terminate each record loaded as a row in the table using a semicolon (`;`). The `RECORDS DELIMITED BY` clause specifies this value.

```sql
LOAD DATA
  INFILE 'emp_recdelim.dat'
    BADFILE 'emp_recdelim.bad'
  APPEND
  INTO TABLE emp
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
    RECORDS DELIMITED BY ';'
    TRAILING NULLCOLS
  (
    empno,
    ename,
    job,
    mgr,
    hiredate,
    sal,
    deptno,
    comm
  )
```

The following is the corresponding data file. The content is a single physical record in the data file. The record delimiter character is included following the last record, that is, at the end of the file.

```sql
9101,ROGERS,CLERK,7902,17-DEC-10,1980.00,20,;9102,PETERSON,SALESMAN,7698,20-DEC-10,
2600.00,30,2300.00;9103,WARREN,SALESMAN,7698,22-DEC-10,5250.00,30,2500.00;9104,"JONES, 
JR.",MANAGER,7839,02-APR-09,7975.00,20,;
```

### FILLER clause

This control file uses the `FILLER` clause in the data fields for the `sal` and `comm` columns. EDB\*Loader ignores the values in these fields and sets the corresponding columns to null.

```sql
LOAD DATA
  INFILE       'emp_fixed.dat'
    BADFILE    'emp_fixed.bad'
  APPEND
  INTO TABLE emp
    TRAILING NULLCOLS
  (
    empno       POSITION (1:4),
    ename       POSITION (5:14),
    job         POSITION (15:23),
    mgr         POSITION (24:27),
    hiredate    POSITION (28:38),
    sal         FILLER POSITION (39:46),
    deptno      POSITION (47:48),
    comm        FILLER POSITION (49:56)
  )
```

Using the same fixed-width data file as in the prior fixed-width field example, the resulting rows in the table appear as follows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno > 9100;
__OUTPUT__
 empno| ename     | job     | mgr|   hiredate        | sal   | comm   |deptno
------+-----------+---------+----+-------------------+-------+--------+------
  9101| ROGERS    | CLERK   |7902| 17-DEC-10 00:00:00|       |        |  20
  9102| PETERSON  | SALESMAN|7698| 20-DEC-10 00:00:00|       |        |  30
  9103| WARREN    | SALESMAN|7698| 22-DEC-10 00:00:00|       |        |  30
  9104| JONES, JR.| MANAGER |7839| 02-APR-09 00:00:00|       |        |  20
(4 rows)
```

### BOUNDFILLER clause

This control file uses the `BOUNDFILLER` clause in the data fields for the `job` and `mgr` columns. EDB\*Loader ignores the values in these fields and sets the corresponding columns to null in the same manner as the `FILLER` clause. However, unlike columns with the `FILLER` clause, you can use columns with the `BOUNDFILLER` clause in an expression, as shown for column `jobdesc`.

```sql
LOAD DATA
  INFILE    'emp.dat'
    BADFILE 'emp.bad'
  APPEND
  INTO TABLE empjob
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
    TRAILING NULLCOLS
  (
    empno,
    ename,
    job          BOUNDFILLER,
    mgr          BOUNDFILLER,
    hiredate     FILLER,
    sal          FILLER,
    deptno       FILLER,
    comm         FILLER,
    jobdesc      ":job || ' for manager ' || :mgr"
  )
```

The following is the delimiter-separated data file used in this example:

```sql
9101,ROGERS,CLERK,7902,17-DEC-10,1980.00,20
9102,PETERSON,SALESMAN,7698,20-DEC-10,2600.00,30,2300.00
9103,WARREN,SALESMAN,7698,22-DEC-10,5250.00,30,2500.00
9104,"JONES, JR.",MANAGER,7839,02-APR-09,7975.00,20
```

The following table is loaded using the preceding control file and data file:

```sql
CREATE TABLE empjob (
    empno               NUMBER(4) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT empjob_pk PRIMARY KEY,
    ename               VARCHAR2(10),
    job                 VARCHAR2(9),
    mgr                 NUMBER(4),
    jobdesc             VARCHAR2(25)
);
```

The resulting rows in the table appear as follows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM empjob;
__OUTPUT__
 empno |    ename   | job | mgr |         jobdesc
-------+------------+-----+-----+---------------------------
 9101  | ROGERS     |     |     | CLERK for manager 7902
 9102  | PETERSON   |     |     | SALESMAN for manager 7698
 9103  | WARREN     |     |     | SALESMAN for manager 7698
 9104  | JONES, JR. |     |     | MANAGER for manager 7839
(4 rows)
```

### Field types with length specification

This control file contains the field type clauses with the length specification:

```sql
LOAD DATA
  INFILE 'emp_fixed.dat'
    BADFILE 'emp_fixed.bad'
  APPEND
  INTO TABLE emp
    TRAILING NULLCOLS
  (
    empno       CHAR(4),
    ename       CHAR(10),
    job         POSITION (15:23) CHAR(9),
    mgr         INTEGER EXTERNAL(4),
    hiredate    DATE(11) "DD-MON-YY",
    sal         DECIMAL EXTERNAL(8),
    deptno      POSITION (47:48),
    comm        POSITION (49:56) DECIMAL EXTERNAL(8)
  )
```

!!! Note
    You can use the `POSITION` clause and the `fieldtype(length)` clause individually or in combination as long as each field definition contains at least one of the two clauses.

The following is the corresponding data file containing fixed-width fields:

```sql
9101ROGERS     CLERK      790217-DEC-10  1980.0020
9102PETERSON   SALESMAN   769820-DEC-10  2600.0030  2300.00
9103WARREN     SALESMAN   769822-DEC-10  5250.0030  2500.00
9104JONES, JR. MANAGER    783902-APR-09  7975.0020
```

The resulting rows in the table appear as follows:

```sql
SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno > 9100;
__OUTPUT__
 empno| ename     | job     | mgr|   hiredate        | sal   | comm   |deptno
------+-----------+---------+----+-------------------+-------+--------+------
  9101| ROGERS    | CLERK   |7902| 17-DEC-10 00:00:00|1980.00|        |  20
  9102| PETERSON  | SALESMAN|7698| 20-DEC-10 00:00:00|2600.00| 2300.00|  30
  9103| WARREN    | SALESMAN|7698| 22-DEC-10 00:00:00|5250.00| 2500.00|  30
  9104| JONES, JR.| MANAGER |7839| 02-APR-09 00:00:00|7975.00|        |  20
(4 rows)
```

### NULLIF clause

This example uses the `NULLIF` clause on the `sal` column to set it to null for employees of job `MANAGER`. It also uses the clause on the `comm` column to set it to null if the employee isn't a `SALESMAN` and isn't in department `30`. In other words, a `comm` value is accepted if the employee is a `SALESMAN` or is a member of department `30`.

The following is the control file:

```sql
LOAD DATA
  INFILE    'emp_fixed_2.dat'
    BADFILE 'emp_fixed_2.bad'
  APPEND
  INTO TABLE emp
    TRAILING NULLCOLS
  (
    empno       POSITION (1:4),
    ename       POSITION (5:14),
    job         POSITION (15:23),
    mgr         POSITION (24:27),
    hiredate    POSITION (28:38),
    sal         POSITION (39:46) NULLIF job = 'MANAGER',
    deptno      POSITION (47:48),
    comm        POSITION (49:56) NULLIF job <> 'SALESMAN' AND deptno <> '30'
  )
```

The following is the corresponding data file:

```sql
9101ROGERS       CLERK        790217-DEC-10     1980.0020
9102PETERSON     SALESMAN     769820-DEC-10     2600.0030     2300.00
9103WARREN       SALESMAN     769822-DEC-10     5250.0030     2500.00
9104JONES, JR.   MANAGER      783902-APR-09     7975.0020
9105ARNOLDS      CLERK        778213-SEP-10     3750.0030     800.00
9106JACKSON      ANALYST      756603-JAN-11     4500.0040     2000.00
9107MAXWELL      SALESMAN     769820-DEC-10     2600.0010     1600.00
```

The resulting rows in the table appear as follows:

```sql
SELECT empno, ename, job, NVL(TO_CHAR(sal),'--null--') "sal",
  NVL(TO_CHAR(comm),'--null--') "comm", deptno FROM emp WHERE empno > 9100;
__OUTPUT__
 empno |   ename    |    job   |   sal    |   comm   | deptno
-------+------------+----------+----------+----------+-------
  9101 | ROGERS     | CLERK    | 1980.00  | --null-- |   20
  9102 | PETERSON   | SALESMAN | 2600.00  | 2300.00  |   30
  9103 | WARREN     | SALESMAN | 5250.00  | 2500.00  |   30
  9104 | JONES, JR. | MANAGER  | --null-- | --null-- |   20
  9105 | ARNOLDS    | CLERK    | 3750.00  |  800.00  |   30
  9106 | JACKSON    | ANALYST  | 4500.00  | --null-- |   40
  9107 | MAXWELL    | SALESMAN | 2600.00  | 1600.00  |   10
(7 rows)
```

!!! Note
    The `sal` column for employee `JONES, JR.` is null since the job is `MANAGER`.

The `comm` values from the data file for employees `PETERSON`, `WARREN`, `ARNOLDS`, and `MAXWELL` are all loaded into the `comm` column of the `emp` table since these employees are either `SALESMAN` or members of department `30`.

The `comm` value of `2000.00` in the data file for employee `JACKSON` is ignored, and the `comm` column of the `emp` table is set to null. This employee isn't a `SALESMAN` or a member of department `30`.

### SELECT statement in a field expression

This example uses a `SELECT` statement in the expression of the field definition to return the value to load into the column:

```sql
LOAD DATA
  INFILE    'emp_fixed.dat'
    BADFILE 'emp_fixed.bad'
  APPEND
  INTO TABLE emp
    TRAILING NULLCOLS
  (
    empno       POSITION (1:4),
    ename       POSITION (5:14),
    job         POSITION (15:23) "(SELECT dname FROM dept WHERE deptno = :deptno)",
    mgr         POSITION (24:27),
    hiredate    POSITION (28:38),
    sal         POSITION (39:46),
    deptno      POSITION (47:48),
    comm        POSITION (49:56)
  )
```

The following is the content of the `dept` table used in the `SELECT` statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM dept;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |    dname   |   loc
---------+------------+---------
   10   | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
   20   | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
   30   | SALES      | CHICAGO
   40   | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
(4 rows)
```

The following is the corresponding data file:

```sql

The resulting rows in the table appear as follows:

```sql

(4 rows)
```

!!! Note
    The `job` column contains the value from the `dname` column of the `dept` table returned by the `SELECT` statement instead of the job name from the data file.

### Multiple INTO TABLE clauses

This example uses multiple `INTO TABLE` clauses. For this example, two empty tables are created with the same data definition as the `emp` table. The following `CREATE TABLE` commands create these two empty tables, without inserting rows from the original `emp` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE emp_research AS SELECT * FROM emp WHERE deptno = 99;
CREATE TABLE emp_sales AS SELECT * FROM emp WHERE deptno = 99;
```

This control file contains two `INTO TABLE` clauses. Without an `APPEND` clause, it uses the default operation of `INSERT`. For this operation, the tables `emp_research` and `emp_sales` must be empty.

```sql
LOAD DATA
  INFILE        'emp_multitbl.dat'
    BADFILE     'emp_multitbl.bad'
    DISCARDFILE 'emp_multitbl.dsc'
  INTO TABLE emp_research
    WHEN (47:48) = '20'
    TRAILING NULLCOLS
  (
    empno      POSITION (1:4),
    ename      POSITION (5:14),
    job        POSITION (15:23),
    mgr        POSITION (24:27),
    hiredate   POSITION (28:38),
    sal        POSITION (39:46),
    deptno     CONSTANT '20',
    comm       POSITION (49:56)
  )
  INTO TABLE emp_sales
    WHEN (47:48) = '30'
    TRAILING NULLCOLS
  (
    empno     POSITION (1:4),
    ename     POSITION (5:14),
    job       POSITION (15:23),
    mgr       POSITION (24:27),
    hiredate  POSITION (28:38),
    sal       POSITION (39:46),
    deptno    CONSTANT '30',
    comm      POSITION (49:56) "ROUND(:comm + (:sal * .25), 0)"
  )
```

The `WHEN` clauses specify that when the field designated by columns 47 through 48 contains `20`, the record is inserted into the `emp_research` table. When that same field contains `30`, the record is inserted into the `emp_sales` table. If neither condition is true, the record is written to the discard file `emp_multitbl.dsc`.

The `CONSTANT` clause is given for column `deptno`, so the specified constant value is inserted into `deptno` for each record. When the `CONSTANT` clause is used, it must be the only clause in the field definition other than the column name to which the constant value is assigned.

Column `comm` of the `emp_sales` table is assigned a SQL expression. Expressions can reference column names by prefixing the column name with a colon character (`:`).

The following is the corresponding data file:

```sql
9101ROGERS     CLERK     790217-DEC-10   1980.0020

9103WARREN     SALESMAN  769822-DEC-10   5250.0030  2500.00
9104JONES, JR. MANAGER   783902-APR-09   7975.0020

9106JACKSON    ANALYST   756603-JAN-11   4500.0040
```

The records for employees `ARNOLDS` and `JACKSON` contain `10` and `40` in columns 47 through 48, which don't satisfy any of the `WHEN` clauses. EDB\*Loader writes these two records to the discard file, `emp_multitbl.dsc`, with the following content:

```sql
9105ARNOLDS   CLERK     778213-SEP-10   3750.0010
9106JACKSON   ANALYST   756603-JAN-11   4500.0040
```

The following are the rows loaded into the `emp_research` and `emp_sales` tables:

```sql
SELECT * FROM emp_research;
__OUTPUT__

<div id="invoking_edb_loader" class="registered_link"></div>

## Invoking EDB\*Loader

You can run EDB\*Loader as superuser or as a normal user. Use the following command to invoke EDB\*Loader from the command line:

```sql
edbldr [ -d <dbname> ] [ -p <port> ] [ -h <host> ]
[ USERID={ <username/password> | <username>/ | <username> | / } ]
[ { -c | connstr= } <CONNECTION_STRING> ]
  CONTROL=<control_file>
[ DATA=<data_file> ]
[ BAD=<bad_file>]
[ DISCARD=<discard_file> ]
[ DISCARDMAX=<max_discard_recs> ]
[ HANDLE_CONFLICTS={ FALSE | TRUE } ]
[ LOG=<log_file> ]
[ PARFILE=<param_file> ]
[ DIRECT={ FALSE | TRUE } ]
[ FREEZE={ FALSE | TRUE } ]
[ ERRORS=<error_count> ]
[ PARALLEL={ FALSE | TRUE } ]
[ ROWS=<n> ]
[ SKIP=<skip_count> ]
[ SKIP_INDEX_MAINTENANCE={ FALSE | TRUE } ]
[ edb_resource_group=<group_name> ]
```

### Description

If you omit the `-d` option, the `-p` option, or the `-h` option, the defaults for the database, port, and host are determined by the same rules as other EDB Postgres Advanced Server utility programs, such as `edb-psql`.

You can specify parameters listed in the syntax diagram in a *parameter file*. Exeptions include the `-d` option, `-p` option, `-h` option, and the `PARFILE` parameter. Specify the parameter file on the command line when you invoke `edbldr` using `PARFILE=param_file`. You can specify some parameters in the `OPTIONS` clause in the control file. For more information on the control file, see [Building the EDB\*Loader control file](#building-the-edbloader-control-file).

You can include the full directory path or a relative directory path to the file name when specifying `control_file`, `data_file`, `bad_file`, `discard_file`, `log_file`, and `param_file`. If you specify the file name alone or with a relative directory path, the file is assumed to exist in the case of `control_file`, `data_file`, or `param_file` relative to the current working directory from which `edbldr` is invoked. In the case of `bad_file`, `discard_file`, or `log_file`, the file is created.

!!! Note
    The control file must exist in the character set encoding of the client where `edbldr` is invoked. If the client is in an encoding different from the database encoding, then you must set the `PGCLIENTENCODING` environment variable on the client to the client’s encoding prior to invoking `edbldr`. This technique ensures character set conversion between the client and the database server is done correctly.

The operating system account used to invoke `edbldr` must have read permission on the directories and files specified by `control_file`, `data_file`, and `param_file`.

The operating system account `enterprisedb` must have write permission on the directories where `bad_file`, `discard_file`, and `log_file` are  written.

!!! Note
    The file names for `control_file`, `data_file`, `bad_file`, `discard_file`, and `log_file` must include the extensions `.ctl`, `.dat`, `.bad`, `.dsc`, and `.log`, respectively. If the provided file name doesn't contain an extension, EDB\*Loader assumes the actual file name includes the appropriate extension.

### Parameters

`dbname`

 Name of the database containing the tables to load.

`port`

 Port number on which the database server is accepting connections.

`host`

 IP address of the host on which the database server is running.

`USERID={ username/password | username/ | username | / }`

 EDB\*Loader connects to the database with `username`. `username` must be a superuser or a username with required privilges. `password` is the password for `username`.

 If you omit the `USERID` parameter, EDB\*Loader prompts for `username` and `password`. If you specify `USERID=username/`, then EDB\*Loader either:
 -  Uses the password file specified by environment variable `PGPASSFILE` if `PGPASSFILE` is set
 -  Uses the `.pgpass` password file (`pgpass.conf` on Windows systems) if `PGPASSFILE` isn't set 
 
 If you specify `USERID=username`, then EDB\*Loader prompts for `password`. If you specify `USERID=/`, the connection is attempted using the operating system account as the user name.

 !!! Note
  EDB\*Loader ignores the EDB Postgres Advanced Server connection environment variables `PGUSER` and `PGPASSWORD`. See the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html) for information on the `PGPASSFILE` environment variable and the password file.

`-c CONNECTION_STRING`

`connstr=CONNECTION_STRING`

 The `-c` or `connstr=` option allows you to specify all the connection parameters supported by libpq. With this option, you can also specify SSL connection parameters or other connection parameters supported by libpq. If you provide connection options such as `-d`, `-h`, `-p` or `userid=dbuser/dbpass` separately, they might override the values provided by the `-c` or `connstr=` option.

`CONTROL=control_file`

 `control_file` specifies the name of the control file containing EDB\*Loader directives. If you don't specify a file extension, an extension of `.ctl` is assumed.

 For more information on the control file, see [Building the EDB\*Loader control file](#building-the-edbloader-control-file).

`DATA=data_file`

 `data_file` specifies the name of the file containing the data to load into the target table. If you don't specify a file extension, an extension of `.dat` is assumed. Specifying a `data_file` on the command line overrides the `INFILE` clause specified in the control file.

 For more information about `data_file`, see [Building the EDB\*Loader control file](#building-the-edbloader-control-file).

`BAD=bad_file`

 `bad_file` specifies the name of a file that receives input data records that can't be loaded due to errors. Specifying a `bad_file` on the command line overrides any `BADFILE` clause specified in the control file.

 For more information about `bad_file`, see [Building the EDB\*Loader control file](#building-the-edbloader-control-file).

`DISCARD=discard_file`

 `discard_file` is the name of the file that receives input data records that don't meet any table’s selection criteria. Specifying a `discard_file` on the command line overrides the `DISCARDFILE` clause in the control file.

 For more information about `discard_file`, see [Building the EDB\*Loader control file](#building-the-edbloader-control-file).

`DISCARDMAX=max_discard_recs`

 `max_discard_recs` is the maximum number of discarded records that can be encountered from the input data records before terminating the EDB\*Loader session. Specifying `max_discard_recs` on the command line overrides the `DISCARDMAX` or `DISCARDS` clause in the control file.

 For more information about `max_discard_recs`, see [Building the EDB\*Loader control file](#building-the-edbloader-control-file).

`HANDLE_CONFLICTS={ FALSE | TRUE }`

 If any record insertion fails due to a unique constraint violation, EDB\*Loader aborts the entire operation. You can instruct EDB\*Loader to instead move the duplicate record to the `BAD` file and continue processing by setting `HANDLE_CONFLICTS` to `TRUE`. This behavior applies only if indexes are present. By default, `HANDLE_CONFLICTS` is set to `FALSE`.

 Setting `HANDLE_CONFLICTS` to `TRUE` isn't supported with direct path loading. If you set this parameter to `TRUE` when direct path loading, EDB\*Loader throws an error.

`LOG=log_file`

 `log_file` specifies the name of the file in which EDB\*Loader records the results of the EDB\*Loader session.

 If you omit the `LOG` parameter, EDB\*Loader creates a log file with the name `control_file_base.log` in the directory from which `edbldr` is invoked. `control_file_base` is the base name of the control file used in the EDB\*Loader session. The operating system account `enterprisedb` must have write permission on the directory where the log file is written.

`PARFILE=param_file`

 `param_file` specifies the name of the file that contains command line parameters for the EDB\*Loader session. You can specify command line parameters listed in this section in `param_file` instead of on the command line. Exceptions are the `-d`, `-p`, and `-h` options, and the `PARFILE` parameter.

 Any parameter given in `param_file` overrides the same parameter supplied on the command line before the `PARFILE` option. Any parameter given on the command line that appears after the `PARFILE` option overrides the same parameter given in `param_file`.

 !!! Note
  Unlike other EDB\*Loader files, there's no default file name or extension assumed for `param_file`. However, by Oracle SQL\*Loader convention, `.par` is typically used as an extension. It isn't required.

`DIRECT= { FALSE | TRUE }`

 If `DIRECT` is set to `TRUE` EDB\*Loader performs a direct path load instead of a conventional path load. The default value of `DIRECT` is `FALSE`.

 Don't set `DIRECT=true` when loading the data into a replicated table. If you're using EDB\*Loader to load data into a replicated table and set `DIRECT=true`, indexes might omit rows that are in a table or might contain references to rows that were deleted. EnterpriseDB doesn't support direct inserts to load data into replicated tables.

 For information about direct path loads, see [Direct path load](#direct-path-load).

`FREEZE= { FALSE | TRUE }`

 Set `FREEZE` to `TRUE` to copy the data with the rows `frozen`. A tuple guaranteed to be visible to all current and future transactions is marked as frozen to prevent transaction ID wraparound. For more information about frozen tuples, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/routine-vacuuming.html).

 You must specify a data-loading type of `TRUNCATE` in the control file when using the `FREEZE` option. `FREEZE` isn't supported for direct loading.

 By default, `FREEZE` is `FALSE`.

`ERRORS=error_count`

 `error_count` specifies the number of errors permitted before aborting the EDB\*Loader session. The default is `50`.

`PARALLEL= { FALSE | TRUE }`

 Set `PARALLEL` to `TRUE` to indicate that this EDB\*Loader session is one of a number of concurrent EDB\*Loader sessions participating in a parallel direct path load. The default value of `PARALLEL` is `FALSE`.

 When `PARALLEL` is `TRUE`, the `DIRECT` parameter must also be set to `TRUE`.

 For more information about parallel direct path loads, see [Parallel direct path load](#parallel-direct-path-load).

`ROWS=n`

 `n` specifies the number of rows that EDB\*Loader commits before loading the next set of `n` rows.

`SKIP=skip_count`

 Number of records at the beginning of the input data file to skip before loading begins. The default is `0`.

`SKIP_INDEX_MAINTENANCE= { FALSE | TRUE }`

 If set to `TRUE`, index maintenance isn't performed as part of a direct path load, and indexes on the loaded table are marked as invalid. The default value of `SKIP_INDEX_MAINTENANCE` is `FALSE`.

 During a parallel direct path load, target table indexes aren't updated. They are marked as invalid after the load is complete.

 You can use the `REINDEX` command to rebuild an index. For more information about the `REINDEX` command, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-reindex.htm).

`edb_resource_group=group_name`

 `group_name` specifies the name of an EDB Resource Manager resource group to which to assign the EDB\*Loader session.

 Any default resource group that was assigned to the session is overridden by the resource group given by the `edb_resource_group` parameter specified on the `edbldr` command line. An example of such a group is a database user running the EDB\*Loader session who was assigned a default resource group with the `ALTER ROLE ... SET` `edb_resource_group` command.

### Examples

This example invokes EDB\*Loader using a control file named `emp.ctl` to load a table in database `edb`. The file is located in the current working directory.

```shell
$ /usr/edb/as14/bin/edbldr -d edb USERID=enterprisedb/password
CONTROL=emp.ctl
EDB*Loader: Copyright (c) 2007-2021, EnterpriseDB Corporation.

Successfully loaded (4) records
```

In this example, EDB\*Loader prompts for the user name and password since they are omitted from the command line. In addition, the files for the bad file and log file are specified with the `BAD` and `LOG` command line parameters.

```shell
$ /usr/edb/as14/bin/edbldr -d edb CONTROL=emp.ctl BAD=/tmp/emp.bad
LOG=/tmp/emp.log
Enter the user name : enterprisedb
Enter the password :
EDB*Loader: Copyright (c) 2007-2021, EnterpriseDB Corporation.

Successfully loaded (4) records
```

This example runs EDB\*Loader using a parameter file located in the current working directory. The `SKIP` and `ERRORS` parameter default values are specified in the parameter file in addition the `CONTROL`, `BAD`, and `LOG` files. The parameter file, `emp.par`, contains the following:

```ini
CONTROL=emp.ctl
BAD=/tmp/emp.bad
LOG=/tmp/emp.log
SKIP=1
ERRORS=10
```

Invoke EDB\*Loader with the parameter file:

```shell
$ /usr/edb/as14/bin/edbldr -d edb PARFILE=emp.par
Enter the user name : enterprisedb
Enter the password :
EDB*Loader: Copyright (c) 2007-2021, EnterpriseDB Corporation.

Successfully loaded (3) records
```

This example invokes EDB\*Loader using a `connstr=` option that uses the `emp.ctl` control file located in the current working directory to load a table in a database named `edb`:

```shell
$ /usr/edb/as14/bin/edbldr connstr=\"sslmode=verify-ca sslcompression=0
host=127.0.0.1 dbname=edb port=5444 user=enterprisedb\" CONTROL=emp.ctl
EDB*Loader: Copyright (c) 2007-2021, EnterpriseDB Corporation.

Successfully loaded (4) records
```

In the following example EDB\*Loader is invoked using a normal user. For this example, one empty table `bar` is created and a normal user `bob` is created. The `bob` user is granted all privileges on the table `bar`. The following CREATE TABLE command creates the empty table, the CREATE USER command creates the user and the GRANT command gives required privileges to `bob` user on the `bar` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE bar(i int); 
CREATE USER bob identified by '123';
GRANT ALL on bar TO bob;
```

The control file and data file:

```shell
## Control file
EDBAS/ - (master) $ cat /tmp/edbldr.ctl 
LOAD DATA INFILE '/tmp/edbldr.dat'
truncate into table bar
(
i position(1:1)
)

## Data file
EDBAS/ - (master) $ cat /tmp/edbldr.dat 
1
2
3
5
```

Invoke the EDB*Loader:

```shell
EDBAS/ - (master) $ /usr/edb/as15/bin/edbldr -d edb userid=bob/123 control=/tmp/edbldr.ctl
EDB*Loader: Copyright (c) 2007-2022, EnterpriseDB Corporation.

Successfully loaded (4) records
```

<div id="exit_codes" class="registered_link"></div>

### Exit codes

When EDB\*Loader exits, it returns one of the following codes:

| Exit code | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `0`       | Indicates that all rows loaded successfully.                                                                                                                                |
| `1`       | Indicates that EDB\*Loader encountered command line or syntax errors or aborted the load operation due to an unrecoverable error.                                          |
| `2`       | Indicates that the load completed, but some (or all) rows were rejected or discarded.                                                                                       |
| `3`       | Indicates that EDB\*Loader encountered fatal errors (such as OS errors). This class of errors is equivalent to the `FATAL` or `PANIC` severity levels of PostgreSQL errors. |

<div id="direct_path_load" class="registered_link"></div>

## Direct path load

During a direct path load, EDB\*Loader writes the data directly to the database pages, which is then synchronized to disk. The insert processing associated with a conventional path load is bypassed, resulting in a performance improvement.

Bypassing insert processing reduces the types of constraints on the target table. The following types of constraints are permitted on the target table of a direct path load:

-   Primary key
-   Not null constraints
-   Indexes (unique or non-unique)

The following are restrictions on the target table of a direct path load:

-   Triggers aren't permitted.
-   Check constraints aren't permitted.
-   Foreign key constraints on the target table referencing another table aren't permitted.
-   Foreign key constraints on other tables referencing the target table aren't permitted.
-   You must not partition the table.
-   Rules can exist on the target table, but they aren't executed.

!!! Note
    Currently, a direct path load in EDB\*Loader is more restrictive than in Oracle SQL\*Loader. The preceding restrictions don't apply to Oracle SQL\*Loader in most cases. The following restrictions apply to a control file used in a direct path load:

    -   Multiple table loads aren't supported. You can specify only one `INTO TABLE` clause in the control file.
    -   You can't use SQL expressions in the data field definitions of the `INTO TABLE` clause.
    -   The `FREEZE` option isn't supported for direct path loading.

To run a direct path load, add the `DIRECT=TRUE` option:

```shell
$ /usr/edb/as14/bin/edbldr -d edb USERID=enterprisedb/password
CONTROL=emp.ctl DIRECT=TRUE
EDB*Loader: Copyright (c) 2007-2021, EnterpriseDB Corporation.

Successfully loaded (4) records
```

<div id="parallel_direct_path_load" class="registered_link"></div>

## Parallel direct path load

You can further improve the performance of a direct path load by distributing the loading process over two or more sessions running concurrently. Each session runs a direct path load into the same table.

Since the same table is loaded from multiple sessions, the input records to load into the table must be divided among several data files. This way, each EDB\*Loader session uses its own data file, and the same record isn't loaded into the table more than once.

The target table of a parallel direct path load is under the same restrictions as a direct path load run in a single session.

The following are the restrictions on the target table of a direct path load:

-   Triggers aren't permitted.
-   Check constraints aren't permitted.
-   Foreign key constraints on the target table referencing another table aren't permitted.
-   Foreign key constraints on other tables referencing the target table aren't permitted.
-   You must not partition the table.
-   Rules can exist on the target table, but they aren't executed.

In addition, you must specify the `APPEND` clause in the control file used by each EDB\*Loader session.

To run a parallel direct path load, run EDB\*Loader in a separate session for each participant of the parallel direct path load. You must include the `DIRECT=TRUE` and `PARALLEL=TRUE` parameters when invoking each such EDB\*Loader session.

Each EDB\*Loader session runs as an independent transaction. Aborting and rolling back changes of one of the parallel sessions doesn't affect the loading done by the other parallel sessions.

!!! Note
    In a parallel direct path load, each EDB\*Loader session reserves a fixed number of blocks in the target table using turns. Some of the blocks in the last allocated chunk might not be used, and those blocks remain uninitialized. A later use of the `VACUUM` command on the target table might show warnings about these uninitialized blocks, such as the following:

```text
WARNING: relation "emp" page 98264 is uninitialized --- fixing

WARNING: relation "emp" page 98265 is uninitialized --- fixing

WARNING: relation "emp" page 98266 is uninitialized --- fixing
```

This behavior is expected and doesn't indicate data corruption.

Indexes on the target table aren't updated during a parallel direct path load. They are therefore marked as invalid after the load is complete. You must use the `REINDEX` command to rebuild the indexes.

This example shows the use of a parallel direct path load on the `emp` table.

!!! Note
    If you attempt a parallel direct path load on the sample `emp` table provided with EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you must first remove the triggers and constraints referencing the `emp` table. In addition, the primary key column, `empno`, was expanded from `NUMBER(4)` to `NUMBER` in this example to allow for inserting more rows.

This is the control file used in the first session:

```sql
LOAD DATA
  INFILE    '/home/user/loader/emp_parallel_1.dat'
  APPEND
  INTO TABLE emp
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
    TRAILING NULLCOLS
  (
    empno,
    ename,
    job,
    mgr,
    hiredate,
    sal,
    deptno,
    comm
  )
```

You must specify the `APPEND` clause in the control file for a parallel direct path load.

This example invokes EDB\*Loader in the first session. You must specify the `DIRECT=TRUE` and `PARALLEL=TRUE` parameters.

```shell
$ /usr/edb/as14/bin/edbldr -d edb USERID=enterprisedb/password
CONTROL=emp_parallel_1.ctl DIRECT=TRUE PARALLEL=TRUE
WARNING: index maintenance will be skipped with PARALLEL load
EDB*Loader: Copyright (c) 2007-2021, EnterpriseDB Corporation.
```

The control file used for the second session appears as follows. It's the same as the one used in the first session, but it uses a different data file.

```sql
LOAD DATA
  INFILE '/home/user/loader/emp_parallel_2.dat'
  APPEND
  INTO TABLE emp
    FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' OPTIONALLY ENCLOSED BY '"'
    TRAILING NULLCOLS
  (
    empno,
    ename,
    job,
    mgr,
    hiredate,
    sal,
    deptno,
    comm
  )
```

This control file is used in a second session:

```shell
$ /usr/edb/as14/bin/edbldr -d edb USERID=enterprisedb/password
CONTROL=emp_parallel_2.ctl DIRECT=TRUE PARALLEL=TRUE
WARNING: index maintenance will be skipped with PARALLEL load
EDB*Loader: Copyright (c) 2007-2021, EnterpriseDB Corporation.
```

EDB\*Loader displays the following message in each session when the load operation completes:

```text
Successfully loaded (10000) records
```

This query shows that the index on the emp table was marked `INVALID`:

```sql
SELECT index_name, status FROM user_indexes WHERE table_name = 'EMP';
__OUTPUT__
  index_name | status
-------------+---------
   EMP_PK    | INVALID
 (1 row)
```

!!! Note
    `user_indexes` is the view of indexes compatible with Oracle databases owned by the current user.

Queries on the `emp` table don't use the index unless you rebuild it using the `REINDEX` command:

```sql
REINDEX INDEX emp_pk;
```

A later query on `user_indexes` shows that the index is now marked as `VALID`:

```sql
SELECT index_name, status FROM user_indexes WHERE table_name = 'EMP';
__OUTPUT__
  index_name | status
-------------+--------
   EMP_PK    | VALID
 (1 row)
```

## Remote loading

EDB\*Loader supports a feature called *remote loading*. In remote loading, the database containing the table to load is running on a database server on a host different from the one where EDB\*Loader is invoked with the input data source.

This feature is useful if you have a large amount of data to load, and you don't want to create a large data file on the host running the database server.

In addition, you can use the standard input feature to pipe the data from the data source, such as another program or script, directly to EDB\*Loader. EDB\*Loader then loads the table in the remote database. This feature bypasses having to create a data file on disk for EDB\*Loader.

Performing remote loading along with using standard input requires the following:

-   The `edbldr` program must be installed on the client host on which to invoke it with the data source for the EDB\*Loader session.
-   The control file must contain the clause `INFILE 'stdin'` so you can pipe the data directly into EDB\*Loader’s standard input. For information on the `INFILE` clause and the EDB\*Loader control file, see [Building the EDB\*Loader control file](#building-the-edbloader-control-file).
-   All files used by EDB\*Loader, such as the control file, bad file, discard file, and log file, must reside on or be created on the client host on which `edbldr` is invoked.
-   When invoking EDB\*Loader, use the `-h` option to specify the IP address of the remote database server. For more information, see [Invoking EDB\*Loader](#invoking-edbloader).
-   Use the operating system pipe operator (`|`) or input redirection operator (`<`) to supply the input data to EDB\*Loader.

This example loads a database running on a database server at `192.168.1.14` using data piped from a source named `datasource`:

```shell
datasource | ./edbldr -d edb -h 192.168.1.14 USERID=enterprisedb/password
CONTROL=remote.ctl
```

This example also shows how you can use standard input:

```shell
./edbldr -d edb -h 192.168.1.14 USERID=enterprisedb/password
CONTROL=remote.ctl < datasource
```

## Updating a table with a conventional path load

You can use EDB\*Loader with a conventional path load to update the rows in a table, merging new data with the existing data. When you invoke EDB\*Loader to perform an update, the server searches the table for an existing row with a matching primary key:

-   If the server locates a row with a matching key, it replaces the existing row with the new row.
-   If the server doesn't locate a row with a matching key, it adds the new row to the table.

To use EDB\*Loader to update a table, the table must have a primary key. You can't use EDB\*Loader to update a partitioned table.

To perform `UPDATE`, use the same steps as when performing a conventional path load:

1.  Create a data file that contains the rows you want to update or insert.
2.  Define a control file that uses the `INFILE` keyword to specify the name of the data file. For information about building the EDB\*Loader control file, see [Building the EDB\*Loader control file](#building-the-edbloader-control-file).
3.  Invoke EDB\*Loader, specifying the database name, connection information, and the name of the control file. For information about invoking EDB\*Loader, see [Invoking EDB\*Loader](#invoking-edbloader).

This example uses the `emp` table that's distributed with the EDB Postgres Advanced Server sample data. By default, the table contains:

```sql
edb=# select * from emp;
__OUTPUT__
empno|ename |   job   |  mgr |       hiredate     |   sal    | comm  | deptno

```

This control file (`emp_update.ctl`) specifies the fields in the table in a comma-delimited list. The control file performs an `UPDATE` on the `emp` table.

```sql
LOAD DATA
  INFILE 'emp_update.dat'
  BADFILE 'emp_update.bad'
  DISCARDFILE 'emp_update.dsc'
UPDATE INTO TABLE emp
FIELDS TERMINATED BY ","
(empno, ename, job, mgr, hiredate, sal, comm, deptno)
```

The data that's being updated or inserted is saved in the `emp_update.dat` file. `emp_update.dat` contains:

```sql
7521,WARD,MANAGER,7839,22-FEB-81 00:00:00,3000.00,0.00,30

Invoke EDB\*Loader, specifying the name of the database (`edb`), the name of a database user (and their associated password) and the name of the control file (`emp_update.ctl`):

```shell
edbldr -d edb userid=user_name/password control=emp_update.ctl
```

After performing the update, the `emp` table contains:

```sql
