While minor upgrades between versions are fairly simple and require only installing new executables, past major version upgrades were both expensive and time consuming. `pg_upgrade` eases migration between any version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server (version 9.0 or later) and any later release of EDB Postgres Advanced Server that's supported on the same platform.

Without `pg_upgrade`, to migrate from an earlier version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server to the newest version:

1.  Export all of your data using `pg_dump`. 
1.  Install the new release. 
1.  Run `initdb` to create a new cluster. 
1.  Import your old data.

!!! Note
    `pg_upgrade` can reduce both the amount of time and the disk space required for many major-version upgrades.

The `pg_upgrade` utility performs an in-place transfer of existing data between EDB Postgres Advanced Server and any later version.

Several factors determine if an in-place upgrade is practical:

-   The on-disk representation of user-defined tables must not change between the original version and the upgraded version.
-   The on-disk representation of data types must not change between the original version and the upgraded version.
-   To upgrade between major versions of EDB Postgres Advanced Server with `pg_upgrade`, both versions must share a common binary representation for each data type. Therefore, you can't use `pg_upgrade` to migrate from a 32-bit to a 64-bit Linux platform.

Before performing a version upgrade, `pg_upgrade` verifies that the old cluster and the new cluster are compatible.

If the upgrade involves a change in the on-disk representation of database objects or data, or if it involves a change in the binary representation of data types, `pg_upgrade` can't perform the upgrade. To upgrade, you have to `pg_dump` the old data and then import that data to the new cluster.

The `pg_upgrade` executable is distributed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server and is installed as part of the Database Server component. You don't need to further install or configure it.
