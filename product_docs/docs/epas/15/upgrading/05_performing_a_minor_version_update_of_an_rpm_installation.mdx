If you used an RPM package to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server or its supporting components, you can use `yum` to perform a minor version upgrade to a more recent version. To review a list of the package updates that are available for your system, open a command line, assume root privileges, and enter the command:

```shell
yum check-update <package_name>
```

Where `package_name` is the search term for which you want to search for updates. You can include wildcard values in the search term. To use `yum update` to install an updated package, use the command:

```shell
yum update <package_name>
```

Where `package_name` is the name of the package you want to update. Include wildcard values in the update command to update multiple related packages with a single command. For example, use the following command to update all packages whose names include the expression `edb`:

```shell
yum update edb*
```

!!! Note
    The `yum update` command performs an update only between minor releases. To update between major releases, use `pg_upgrade`.

For more information about using `yum` commands and options, enter `yum --help` at the command line.

!!! If edb_sqlpatch result gives below message, it is necessary to execute edb_sqlpatch for system catalog.
    Here is an output example:
    ```shell
    * database edb
    0 patches were previously applied to this database.
    58 patches need to be applied to this database.
    ```
    In this case , you need to execute this post rpm update:
    ```shell
    edb_sqlpatch -af
    ```
For more information about using `edb_sqlpatch` commands and options, please see [edb_sqlpatch](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/tools/edb_sqlpatch/#overview) page.
