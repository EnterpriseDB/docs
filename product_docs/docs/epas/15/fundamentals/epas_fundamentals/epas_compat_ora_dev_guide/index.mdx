EDB Postgres Advanced Server makes Postgres look, feel, and operate more like Oracle, so when you migrate, there is less code to rewrite, and you can be up and running quickly. The Oracle compatibility features allow you to run many applications written for Oracle in EDB Postgres Advanced Server with minimal to no changes. 

EDB Postgres Advanced Server provides Oracle compatible:
- [Stored procedure language (SPL)](/epas/latest/application_programming/epas_compat_spl/) when creating database server-side application logic for stored procedures, functions, triggers, and packages   
- [Data types that are compatible with Oracle databases](/epas/latest/reference/sql_reference/02_the_sql_language/02_data_types/)
- [SQL statements](/epas/latest/reference/sql_reference/02_the_sql_language/01_sql_syntax/) that are compatible with Oracle SQL
- [System and built-in functions](/epas/latest/reference/sql_reference/02_the_sql_language/03_functions_and_operators/) for use in SQL statements and procedural logic
- [System catalog views](/epas/latest/reference/oracle_compatibility_reference/epas_compat_cat_views/)  that are compatible with Oracle’s data dictionary
- [Additional compatibility with Oracle MERGE](/epas/latest/reference/oracle_compatibility_reference/epas_compat_sql/65a_merge.mdx).
