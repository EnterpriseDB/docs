EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) is a stand-alone proprietary database server that adds extended functionality to the open-source PostgreSQL database. 

EPAS is designed to provide enterprise capabilities on top of the features present in community Postgres. These capabilities:

- [help database administrators to maintain and operate EPAS databases](../../database_administration)
- [include enhanced SQL functionality and other features that add flexibility and convenience](../../application_programming/15_enhanced_sql_and_other_misc_features/)
- [extend Postgres security with features designed to limit unauthorized access](../../epas_security_guide)
- [assist with performance monitoring and analysis](../../managing_performance)
- [include multiple features designed to increase application programmer productivity](../../application_programming)
- [advanced replication support (version 14 and higher)](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/). 

EPAS also has a significant amount of [Oracle compatibility features](../../working_with_oracle_data) which facilitate Oracle to Postgres migrations. 

EPAS includes extended functionality that provides compatibility for syntax supported by Oracle applications, as well as compatible procedural logic, data types, system catalog views and other features that enable EDBâ€™s Oracle compatible connectors, EDB\*Plus, EDB\*Loader and many other tools and functionality. 

Major versions of EPAS are released yearly in line with the major version release of PostgreSQL. EPAS is normally released one to two months after PostgreSQL major version releases. 

EPAS is supported on [Linux x86-64](../../installing/linux_x86_64/), Linux on [IBM Power](../../installing/linux_ppc64le/) and [Windows x86-64](../../installing/windows/).
