The term *EDB Postgres Advanced Server* is used to refer to EDB Postgres Advanced Server. The term *Postgres* is used to generically refer to both PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server. When a distinction needs to be made between these two database systems, the specific names&mdash;PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server&mdash;are used.

The installation directory path of the PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server products is referred to as *POSTGRES_INSTALL_HOME*.

-   For PostgreSQL Linux installations, the default is `/opt/PostgreSQL/x.x` for version 10 and earlier. For later versions, use the PostgreSQL community packages.
-   For EDB Postgres Advanced Server Linux installations performed using the interactive installer for version 10 and earlier, the default is `/opt/edb/asx.x`.
-   For EDB Postgres Advanced Server Linux installations performed using an RPM package, the default is `/usr/edb/asxx`.
-   For EDB Postgres Advanced Server Windows installations, the default is `C:\Program Files\edb\asxx`. The product version number is represented by `x.x` or by `xx` for version 10 and later.
