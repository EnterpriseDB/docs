<div id="the_rownum_pseudo_column" class="registered_link"></div>

`ROWNUM` is a pseudo-column that's assigned an incremental, unique integer value for each row based on the order the rows were retrieved from a query. Therefore, the first row retrieved has `ROWNUM` of `1`, the second row has `ROWNUM` of `2`, and so on.

You can use this feature to limit the number of rows retrieved by a query, as shown in the following example:

```sql
SELECT empno, ename, job FROM emp WHERE ROWNUM < 5;
__OUTPUT__
 empno | ename |   job
-------+-------+----------
 7369  | SMITH | CLERK
 7499  | ALLEN | SALESMAN
 7521  | WARD  | SALESMAN
 7566  | JONES | MANAGER
(4 rows)
```

The `ROWNUM` value is assigned to each row before any sorting of the result set takes place. Thus, the result set is returned in the order given by the `ORDER BY` clause. However the `ROWNUM` values might not be in ascending order, as shown in the following example:

```sql
SELECT ROWNUM, empno, ename, job FROM emp WHERE ROWNUM < 5 ORDER BY ename;
__OUTPUT__
 rownum | empno | ename |   job
--------+-------+-------+----------
      2 |  7499 | ALLEN | SALESMAN
      4 |  7566 | JONES | MANAGER
      1 |  7369 | SMITH | CLERK
      3 |  7521 | WARD  | SALESMAN
(4 rows)
```

The following example shows how you can add a sequence number to every row in the `jobhist` table. First add a column named `seqno` to the table. Then set `seqno` to `ROWNUM` in the `UPDATE` command.

```sql
ALTER TABLE jobhist ADD seqno NUMBER(3);
UPDATE jobhist SET seqno = ROWNUM;
```

The following `SELECT` command shows the new `seqno` values:

```sql
SELECT seqno, empno, TO_CHAR(startdate,'DD-MON-YY') AS start, job FROM
jobhist;
__OUTPUT__
seqno  | empno |   start   |    job
