EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports SQL language that's compatible with Oracle syntax as well as syntax and commands for extended functionality. Extended functionality doesn't provide database compatibility for Oracle or support Oracle-styled applications.

[SQL reference](../../../reference/sql_reference/) provides detailed information about:

-   [Compatible SQL syntax and language elements](../../../reference/sql_reference/01_sql_syntax/)
-   [Data types](../../../reference/sql_reference/02_data_types/)
-   [Functions and operators for the built-in data types](../../../reference/sql_reference/03_functions_and_operators/)
