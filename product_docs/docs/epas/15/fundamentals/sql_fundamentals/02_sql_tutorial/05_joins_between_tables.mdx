<div id="joins_between_tables" class="registered_link"></div>

Queries can access multiple tables at once or access the same table in such a way that multiple rows of the table are processed at the same time. A query that accesses multiple rows of the same or different tables at one time is called a *join* query. 

## Executing a join query 

For example, suppose you want to list all the employee records together with the name and location of the associated department. To do that, you need to compare the `deptno` column of each row of the `emp` table with the `deptno` column of all rows in the `dept` table. Then select the pairs of rows where these values match. You can accomplish this using the following query:

```sql
SELECT emp.ename, emp.sal, dept.deptno, dept.dname, dept.loc FROM emp, dept
WHERE emp.deptno = dept.deptno;
__OUTPUT__
 ename  |   sal   | deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+---------+--------+------------+----------

 SCOTT  | 3000.00 |     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
 JONES  | 2975.00 |     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
 SMITH  |  800.00 |     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
 ADAMS  | 1100.00 |     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
 FORD   | 3000.00 |     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
 WARD   | 1250.00 |     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
 TURNER | 1500.00 |     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
 ALLEN  | 1600.00 |     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
 BLAKE  | 2850.00 |     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
 MARTIN | 1250.00 |     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
 JAMES  |  950.00 |     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
(14 rows)
```

Observe two things about the result set:

-   There's no result row for department 40. That's because there's no matching entry in the `emp` table for department 40, so the join ignores the unmatched rows in the `dept` table. The code that follows shows how to fix this.
-   It's more desirable to list the output columns qualified by table name rather than using \* or leaving out the qualification as follows:

```sql
SELECT ename, sal, dept.deptno, dname, loc FROM emp, dept WHERE emp.deptno =
dept.deptno;
```

Since all the columns had different names (except for `deptno`, which therefore must be qualified), the parser found the table they belong to. However, it's best practice to fully qualify column names in join queries.

You can also write this kind of join queries in this alternative form:

```sql
SELECT emp.ename, emp.sal, dept.deptno, dept.dname, dept.loc FROM emp INNER
JOIN dept ON emp.deptno = dept.deptno;
```

This syntax is not as commonly used, but we show it here to help you understand the following topics.

## Executing an outer join 

In all the above results for joins, no employees were returned that belonged to department 40. As a consequence, the record for department 40 never appears. Next, resolve how to get the department 40 record in the results despite the fact that there are no matching employees. The query must scan the `dept` table and, for each row, find the matching `emp` row. If no matching row is found, we want to substitute some “empty” values for the `emp` table’s columns. This kind of query is called an *outer join*. (The joins you have seen so far are *inner joins*.) The command looks like this:

```sql
SELECT emp.ename, emp.sal, dept.deptno, dept.dname, dept.loc FROM dept LEFT
OUTER JOIN emp ON emp.deptno = dept.deptno;
__OUTPUT__
 ename  |   sal   | deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+---------+--------+------------+----------

 ALLEN  | 1600.00 |     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
 BLAKE  | 2850.00 |     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
 MARTIN | 1250.00 |     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
 JAMES  |  950.00 |     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO

(15 rows)
```

This query is called a *left outer join*. The table mentioned on the left of the join operator has each of its rows in the output at least once. The table on the right has only those rows output that match some row of the left table. When a left-table row is selected for which there is no right-table match, empty (`NULL`) values are substituted for the right-table columns.

An alternative syntax for an outer join is to use the outer join operator, “(+)”, in the join condition in the `WHERE` clause. The outer join operator is placed after the column name of the table for which you substitute null values for unmatched rows. So for all the rows in the `dept` table that have no matching rows in the `emp` table, EDB Postgres Advanced Server returns null for any select list expressions containing columns of `emp`. Hence you can rewrite the earlier example as:

```sql
SELECT emp.ename, emp.sal, dept.deptno, dept.dname, dept.loc FROM dept, emp
WHERE emp.deptno(+) = dept.deptno;
__OUTPUT__
 ename  |   sal   | deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+---------+--------+------------+----------

        |         |     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
(15 rows)
```

## Executing a self join 

You can also join a table against itself, which is called a *self join*. As an example, suppose you want to find the name of each employee and the name of that employee’s manager. You need to compare the `mgr` column of each `emp` row to the `empno` column of all other `emp` rows.

```sql
SELECT e1.ename || ' works for ' || e2.ename AS "Employees and their
Managers" FROM emp e1, emp e2 WHERE e1.mgr = e2.empno;
__OUTPUT__
 Employees and their Managers
------------------------------
 FORD works for JONES
 SCOTT works for JONES
 WARD works for BLAKE
 TURNER works for BLAKE
 MARTIN works for BLAKE
 JAMES works for BLAKE
 ALLEN works for BLAKE
 MILLER works for CLARK
 ADAMS works for SCOTT
 CLARK works for KING
 BLAKE works for KING
 JONES works for KING
 SMITH works for FORD
(13 rows)
```

Here, the `emp` table was relabeled as `e1` to represent the employee row in the select list and in the join condition. It was also relabeled as `e2` to represent the matching employee row acting as manager in the select list and in the join condition. You can use these kinds of aliases in other queries to save some typing. For example:

```sql
SELECT e.ename, e.mgr, d.deptno, d.dname, d.loc FROM emp e, dept d WHERE
e.deptno = d.deptno;
__OUTPUT__
 ename  | mgr  | deptno |   dname    |   loc

This style of abbreviating is used often.
