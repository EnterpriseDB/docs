## Description

`CREATE TABLE` creates an empty table in the current database. The user who creates the table owns the table.

If you provide a schema name, then the table is created in the specified schema. Otherwise it's created in the current schema. Temporary tables exist in a special schema, so you can't provide a schema name when creating a temporary table. The table name must differ from the name of any table, sequence, index, or view in the same schema.

`CREATE TABLE` also creates a data type that represents the composite type corresponding to one row of the table. Therefore, tables can't have the same name as any existing data type in the same schema.

The `PARALLEL` clause sets the degree of parallelism for a table. If you don't specify the `PARALLEL` clause, the server determines a value based on the relation size.

The `NOPARALLEL` clause resets the parallelism for default execution, and `reloptions` shows the `parallel_workers` parameter as `0`.

A table can't have more than 1600 columns. In practice, the effective limit is lower because of tuple-length constraints.

The optional constraint clauses specify constraints or tests that new or updated rows must satisfy for an insert or update operation to succeed. A constraint is a SQL object that helps define the set of valid values in the table in various ways.

You can define table constraints and column constraints. A column constraint is part of a column definition. A table constraint definition isn't tied to a particular column, and it can encompass more than one column. You can also write every column constraint as a table constraint. A column constraint is a notational convenience only if the constraint affects only one column.

!!! Note
    EDB Postgres Advanced Server allows you to create rowids on a foreign table by specifying either the `WITH (ROWIDS)` or `WITH (ROWIDS=true)` option in the `CREATE FOREIGN TABLE` syntax. Specifying the `WITH (ROWIDS)` or `WITH (ROWIDS=true)` option adds a rowid column to a foreign table. For information about `CREATE FOREIGN TABLE`, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createforeigntable.html).

## Parameters

`GLOBAL TEMPORARY`

 Creates the table as a temporary table. Temporary tables are dropped at the end of a session or, optionally, at the end of the current transaction. (See the `ON COMMIT` parameter.) Existing permanent tables with the same name aren't visible to the current session while the temporary table exists unless you reference them with schema-qualified names. In addition, temporary tables aren't visible outside the session in which you created them. This aspect of global temporary tables isn't compatible with Oracle databases. Any indexes created on a temporary table are also temporary.

`UNLOGGED`

 Creates the table as an unlogged table. The data written to unlogged tables isn't written to the write-ahead log (WAL), making them faster than an ordinary table. Indexes created on an unlogged table are unlogged. The contents of an unlogged table aren't replicated to a standby server. The unlogged table is not crash-safe. It's truncated after a crash or shutdown.

`table_name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table to create.

`column_name`

 The name of a column to create in the new table.

`data_type`

 The data type of the column. This can include array specifiers. For more information on the data types included with EDB Postgres Advanced Server, see [Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers: Reference](/epas/latest/epas_compat_reference/02_the_sql_language/02_data_types/).

`DEFAULT default_expr`

 The `DEFAULT` clause assigns a default data value for the column whose column definition it appears in. The value is any variable-free expression. Subqueries and cross references to other columns in the current table aren't allowed. The data type of the default expression must match the data type of the column.

 The default expression is used in any insert operation that doesn't specify a value for the column. If you don't specify a default for a column, then the default is `null`.

`CONSTRAINT constraint_name`

 An optional name for a column or table constraint. If you don't specify one, the system generates a name.

`NOT NULL`

 The column can't contain null values.

`NULL`

 The column can contain null values. This is the default.

 This clause is available only for compatibility with nonstandard SQL databases. We don't recommend using it in new applications.

`UNIQUE` &mdash; Column constraint.

`UNIQUE (column_name [, ...] )` &mdash; Table constraint.

 The `UNIQUE` constraint specifies that a group of one or more distinct columns of a table can contain only unique values. The behavior of the unique table constraint is the same as that for column constraints. However, the unique table constraint can span multiple columns.

 For the purpose of a unique constraint, null values aren't considered equal.

 Each unique table constraint must name a set of columns that's different from the set of columns named by any other unique or primary key constraint defined for the table. Otherwise it's the same constraint listed twice.

`PRIMARY KEY` &mdash; Column constraint.

`PRIMARY KEY ( column_name [, ...] )` &mdash; Table constraint.

 The primary key constraint specifies that any columns of a table can contain only unique, non-duplicated, non-null values. Technically, `PRIMARY KEY` is a combination of `UNIQUE` and `NOT NULL`. However, identifying a set of columns as primary key also provides metadata about the design of the schema. A primary key implies that other tables might rely on this set of columns as a unique identifier for rows.

 You can specify only one primary key for a table, whether as a column constraint or a table constraint.

 Use the primary key constraint to name a set of columns that's different from other sets of columns named by any unique constraint defined for the same table.

`CHECK (expression)`

 The `CHECK` clause specifies an expression producing a Boolean result that new or updated rows must satisfy for an insert or update operation to succeed. Expressions evaluating to `TRUE` or “unknown” succeed. If any row of an insert or update operation produces a `FALSE` result, an error exception is raised and the insert or update doesn't alter the database. A check constraint specified as a column constraint must reference only that column’s value. An expression appearing in a table constraint can reference multiple columns.

 Currently, `CHECK` expressions can't contain subqueries or refer to variables other than columns of the current row.

`REFERENCES` reftable \[ `( refcolumn`) ] \[ `ON DELETE action` ] &mdash; Column constraint.  

`FOREIGN KEY ( column [, ...] ) REFERENCES reftable [ ( refcolumn  [, ...] ) ] [ ON DELETE action ]` &mdash; Table constraint.

 These clauses specify a foreign-key constraint, which requires that a group of columns of the new table must contain only values that match values in the referenced columns of some row of the referenced table. If you omit `refcolumn`, the primary key of the `reftable` is used. The referenced columns must be the columns of a unique or primary key constraint in the referenced table.

 In addition, when the data in the referenced columns changes, certain actions are performed on the data in this table’s columns. The `ON DELETE` clause specifies the action to perform when a referenced row in the referenced table is being deleted. You can't defer referential actions even if the constraint is deferrable. Here are the following possible actions for each clause:

-   `CASCADE`

    Delete any rows referencing the deleted row, or update the value of the referencing column to the new value of the referenced column.

-   `SET NULL`

    Set the referencing columns to `NULL`.

    If the referenced columns change frequently, we recommend adding an index to the foreign key column so that referential actions associated with the foreign key column are performed more efficiently.

`DEFERRABLE`

`NOT DEFERRABLE`

 This parameter controls whether you can defer the constraint. A constraint that isn't deferrable is checked immediately after every command. You can postpone checking constraints that are deferrable until the end of the transaction using the `SET CONSTRAINTS` command. `NOT DEFERRABLE` is the default. Only foreign key constraints currently accept this clause. All other constraint types aren't deferrable.

`INITIALLY IMMEDIATE`

`INITIALLY DEFERRED`

 If a constraint is deferrable, this clause specifies the default time to check the constraint. If the constraint is `INITIALLY IMMEDIATE`, it's checked after each statement. This is the default. If the constraint is `INITIALLY DEFERRED`, it's checked only at the end of the transaction. You can alter the constraint check time with the `SET CONSTRAINTS` command.

`WITH ( ROWIDS [= value ] )`

 The `ROWIDS` option for a table includes `value` equals to `TRUE/ON/1` or `FALSE/OFF/0`. When set to `TRUE/ON/1`, a `ROWID` column is created in the new table. `ROWID` is an auto-incrementing value based on a sequence that starts with `1` and assigned to each row of a table. The default value is always `TRUE`.

 By default, a unique index is created on a `ROWID` column. The `ALTER` and `DROP` operations are restricted on a `ROWID` column.

`ON COMMIT`

 You can control the behavior of temporary tables at the end of a transaction block using `ON COMMIT`. The options are:

-   `PRESERVE ROWS`

    No special action is taken at the ends of transactions. This is the default behavior. This aspect isn't compatible with Oracle databases. The Oracle default is `DELETE ROWS`.

-   `DELETE ROWS`

    All rows in the temporary table are deleted at the end of each transaction block. Essentially, an automatic `TRUNCATE` is done at each commit.

`TABLESPACE tablespace`

 The `tablespace` is the name of the tablespace where the new table is created. If not specified, `default tablespace` is used or the database’s default tablespace if `default_tablespace` is an empty string.

`USING INDEX [ create_index_statement ] TABLESPACE tablespace`

 This clause allows selection of the tablespace in which the index associated with a `UNIQUE` or `PRIMARY KEY` constraint is created. If not specified, `default tablespace` is used, or the database’s default tablespace if `default_tablespace` is an empty string.

 If you specify the `create_index_statement` option, the database server creates an index enabling unique or primary key constraints. The columns specified in the constraint and the columns of an index must be the same, but their order of appearance might differ.

`PARALLEL`

 Include the `PARALLEL` clause to specify the degree of parallelism for the table. Set the `parallel_workers` parameter equal to the degree of parallelism to perform a parallel scan of a table. Alternatively, if you specify `PARALLEL` but don't include a degree of parallelism, an index uses default parallelism.

`NOPARALLEL`

 Specify `NOPARALLEL` for default execution.

`integer`

 The `integer` indicates the degree of parallelism, which is a number of `parallel_workers` used in the parallel operation to perform a parallel scan on a table.

## Notes

EDB Postgres Advanced Server creates an index for each unique constraint and primary key constraint to enforce the uniqueness. Thus, you don't need to create an explicit index for primary key columns. For more information, see [`CREATE INDEX`](/#create_index).

## Examples

Create table `dept` and table `emp`:

```text
CREATE TABLE dept (
    deptno          NUMBER(2) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT dept_pk PRIMARY KEY,
    dname           VARCHAR2(14),
    loc             VARCHAR2(13)
);
CREATE TABLE emp (
    empno           NUMBER(4) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT emp_pk PRIMARY KEY,
    ename           VARCHAR2(10),
    job             VARCHAR2(9),
    mgr             NUMBER(4),
    hiredate        DATE,
    sal             NUMBER(7,2),
    comm            NUMBER(7,2),
    deptno          NUMBER(2) CONSTRAINT emp_ref_dept_fk
                        REFERENCES dept(deptno)
);
```

Define a unique table constraint for the table `dept`. You can define unique table constraints on one or more columns of the table.

```text
CREATE TABLE dept (
    deptno          NUMBER(2) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT dept_pk PRIMARY KEY,
    dname           VARCHAR2(14) CONSTRAINT dept_dname_uq UNIQUE,
    loc             VARCHAR2(13)
);
```

Define a check column constraint:

```text
CREATE TABLE emp (
    empno           NUMBER(4) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT emp_pk PRIMARY KEY,
    ename           VARCHAR2(10),
    job             VARCHAR2(9),
    mgr             NUMBER(4),
    hiredate        DATE,
    sal             NUMBER(7,2) CONSTRAINT emp_sal_ck CHECK (sal > 0),
    comm            NUMBER(7,2),
    deptno          NUMBER(2) CONSTRAINT emp_ref_dept_fk
                        REFERENCES dept(deptno)
);
```

Define a check table constraint:

```text
CREATE TABLE emp (
    empno           NUMBER(4) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT emp_pk PRIMARY KEY,
    ename           VARCHAR2(10),
    job             VARCHAR2(9),
    mgr             NUMBER(4),
    hiredate        DATE,
    sal             NUMBER(7,2),
    comm            NUMBER(7,2),
    deptno          NUMBER(2) CONSTRAINT emp_ref_dept_fk
                        REFERENCES dept(deptno),
    CONSTRAINT new_emp_ck CHECK (ename IS NOT NULL AND empno > 7000)
);
```

Define a primary key table constraint for the table `jobhist`. You can define primary key table constraints on one or more columns of the table.

```text
CREATE TABLE jobhist (
    empno           NUMBER(4) NOT NULL,
    startdate       DATE NOT NULL,
    enddate         DATE,
    job             VARCHAR2(9),
    sal             NUMBER(7,2),
    comm            NUMBER(7,2),
    deptno          NUMBER(2),
    chgdesc         VARCHAR2(80),
    CONSTRAINT jobhist_pk PRIMARY KEY (empno, startdate)
);
```

This example assigns a literal constant default value for the column `job` and makes the default value of `hiredate` the date when the row is inserted.

```text
CREATE TABLE emp (
    empno           NUMBER(4) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT emp_pk PRIMARY KEY,
    ename           VARCHAR2(10),
    job             VARCHAR2(9) DEFAULT 'SALESMAN',
    mgr             NUMBER(4),
    hiredate        DATE DEFAULT SYSDATE,
    sal             NUMBER(7,2),
    comm            NUMBER(7,2),
    deptno          NUMBER(2) CONSTRAINT emp_ref_dept_fk
                        REFERENCES dept(deptno)
);
```

Create table `dept` in tablespace `diskvol1`:

```text
CREATE TABLE dept (
    deptno          NUMBER(2) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT dept_pk PRIMARY KEY,
    dname           VARCHAR2(14),
    loc             VARCHAR2(13)
) TABLESPACE diskvol1;
```

This `PARALLEL` example creates a table `sales` and sets a degree of parallelism to 6:

```text
CREATE TABLE sales (deptno number) PARALLEL 6 WITH (FILLFACTOR=66);
```

This `NOPARALLEL` example creates a table `sales_order` and sets a degree of parallelism to 0:

```text
CREATE TABLE sales_order (deptno number) NOPARALLEL WITH (FILLFACTOR=66);
```

This example creates a table named `dept`. The definition creates a unique key on the `dname` column. The constraint `dept_dname_uq` identifies the `dname` column as a unique key. The preceding statement includes the `USING_INDEX` clause, which explicitly creates an index on a table `dept` with the index statement enabling the unique constraint.

```text
CREATE TABLE dept (
    deptno          NUMBER(2) NOT NULL,
    dname           VARCHAR2(14),
    loc             VARCHAR2(13),
    CONSTRAINT dept_dname_uq UNIQUE(dname)
       USING INDEX (CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_dept_dname_uq ON dept(dname))
);
```

This example creates a table named `emp`. The definition creates a primary key on the `ename` column. The `emp_ename_pk` constraint identifies the `ename` column as a primary key of the `emp` table. The preceding statement includes the `USING_INDEX` clause, which explicitly creates an index on a table `emp` with the index statement enabling the primary constraint.

```text
CREATE TABLE emp (
    empno           NUMBER(4) NOT NULL,
    ename           VARCHAR2(10),
    job             VARCHAR2(9),
    sal             NUMBER(7,2),
    deptno          NUMBER(2),
    CONSTRAINT emp_ename_pk PRIMARY KEY (ename)
        USING INDEX (CREATE INDEX idx_emp_ename_pk ON emp (ename))
);
```
