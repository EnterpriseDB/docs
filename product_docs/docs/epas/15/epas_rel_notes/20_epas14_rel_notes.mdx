| Feature        | Oracle compatibility  | Added the `SUBPARTITION TEMPLATE` clause, so that there is no need to specify the subpartition descriptor or each partition. Specify the `TEMPLATE` once and it gets applied to every partition automatically.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Feature        | Oracle compatibility  | Enabled access to a partition by `PARTITION (<partname>)` or subpartition by `SUBPARTITION (<subpartname>)` clause, which allows the use of such clauses for `SELECT`, `UPDATE`, `INSERT`, and `DELETE` queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Feature        | Oracle compatibility  | Added support for `USERENV()`, a function providing user environment and session related details.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Feature        | Oracle compatibility  | Added support for bitwise `AND` and `OR` functions and aggregates operation on a numeric data type and added bitwise `&` and `\` operators for the numeric data types.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Feature        | Oracle compatibility  | Added support for the  `NOCYCLE` and `ENABLE` keywords.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Feature        | Oracle compatibility  | Generalized `CONNECT_BY` syntax support:<br />-    Allow the use of multiple `PRIOR` expressions.<br />-    Use `AND/OR` with multiple conditions to allow any combination of Unary, Binary or Prior expressions.<br />-    Use of Unary expressions.<br />-    Make `PRIOR` optional with `CONNECT BY` query.<br />-    Enhance the function to detect the cycle, so that it can work with multiple `PRIOR` expressions.<br />-    Support `PRIOR` in the target list. |
| Feature        | Oracle compatibility  | Enhanced `NVL2` to use `ANYCOMPATIBLE` pseudo-type.  Allows the `NVL2` function to support considerably more argument-type combinations. For example, the `NVL2` version can match a call with one `INTEGER` and multiple `BIGINT` arguments and the `INTEGER` is automatically promoted to `BIGINT`. With the previous `ANYELEMENT` version, you had to cast the `INTEGER` explicitly.                                                                                 |
| Feature        | Oracle compatibility  | Added traceability for when an object is created and last modified by a DDL operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Feature        | Oracle compatibility  | When a user tries to create a sequence with an upper boundary out of range, a warning message is logged.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Feature        | Oracle compatibility  | When a user creates a sequence specifying the `NOORDER` keyword, the keyword is considered a `NOOP` keyword and a warning message is logged which states that specifying the `NOORDER` keyword has no beneficial effect in EDB Postgres Advanced and is ignored.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Feature        | Oracle compatibility  | Trailing zeros with `TO_CHAR(numeric)` are removed to be more compatible with Oracle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| Feature        | Oracle compatibility  | Added support for using an alias on table names in `INSERT` statements for accessing a partition or subpartition with `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` statements, so that the alias can be used to qualify the table columns.   For example, `INSERT INTO table_name t (t.col1) VALUES (10);`                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Feature        | Oracle compatibility  | Enhanced `DBMS_SQL` package functions to accept `NUMBER` instead of `INTEGER` so that both `INTEGER` to `NUMBER` functions can accept both `NUMBER` and `INTEGER` type values. Since these functions are compatible with both `NUMBER` and `INTEGER`, EDB Postgres Advanced Server restricts the input range within the `INTEGER`'s limit.                                                                                                                              |
| Feature        | Security              | Added support for selective auditing of objects for specific DML statements such as `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` and to specify either include `(@)` or exclude `(-)` particular statement type for a relation. For more information see [Object Auditing](../epas_guide/03_database_administration/05_edb_audit_logging/09_object_auditing/).                                                                                                             |
| Feature        | Security              | Added capability to control the space consumed by the audit log directory and to manage the audit log files, which can be configured through a new `edb_audit_archiver` configuration parameter. The `edb_audit_archiver` parameter helps in compressing the old audit log files by specifying the compression command and executing the command before removing the old audit log files.                                                                               |
| Feature        | Security              | Provided an option to audit the `SET` commands. To enable this you need to modify the `log_statement` GUC.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Feature        | General functionality | Enabled creation of `ROWID` columns with `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| Feature        | General functionality | Began using global sequences for `ROWID` so that they are unique across the database and can be used on the partitioned tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Feature        | General functionality | Allowed dynamic partition creation to non-owner insert queries.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Feature        | General functionality | Extended `\h` support to work with EDB Postgres Advanced Server objects so that users can see the syntax on a `psql` prompt.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Feature        | General functionality | Added tab-completion support for EDB Postgres Advanced Server syntaxes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
