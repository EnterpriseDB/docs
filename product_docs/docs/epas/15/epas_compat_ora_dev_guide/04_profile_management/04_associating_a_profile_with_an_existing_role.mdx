<div id="associating_a_profile_with_an_existing_role" class="registered_link"></div>

After creating a profile, you can use the `ALTER USER... PROFILE` or `ALTER ROLE... PROFILE` command to associate the profile with a role. The command syntax related to profile management functionality is:

```text
ALTER USER|ROLE <name> [[WITH] option[â€¦]
```

where `option` can be the following compatible clauses:

```text
   PROFILE <profile_name>
| ACCOUNT {LOCK|UNLOCK}
| PASSWORD EXPIRE [AT '<timestamp>']
```

Or, `option` can be the following noncompatible clauses:

```text
| PASSWORD SET AT '<timestamp>'
| LOCK TIME '<timestamp>'
| STORE PRIOR PASSWORD {'<password>' '<timestamp>} [, ...]
```

For information about the administrative clauses of the `ALTER USER` or `ALTER ROLE` command that are supported by EDB Postgres Advanced Server, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-commands.html).

Only a database superuser can use the `ALTER USER|ROLE` clauses that enforce profile management. The clauses enforce the following behaviors:

-   Include the `PROFILE` clause and a `profile_name` to associate a predefined profile with a role or to change the predefined profile associated with a user.

-   Include the `ACCOUNT` clause and the `LOCK` or `UNLOCK` keyword to place the user account in a locked or unlocked state.

-   Include the `LOCK TIME 'timestamp'` clause and a date/time value to lock the role at the specified time and unlock the role at the time indicated by the `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` parameter of the profile assigned to this role. If `LOCK TIME` is used with the `ACCOUNT LOCK` clause, only a database superuser can unlock the role with the `ACCOUNT UNLOCK` clause.

-   Include the `PASSWORD EXPIRE` clause with the `AT 'timestamp'` keywords to specify a date/time when the password associated with the role expires. If you omit the `AT 'timestamp'` keywords, the password expires immediately.

-   Include the `PASSWORD SET AT 'timestamp'` keywords to set the password modification date to the time specified.

-   Include the `STORE PRIOR PASSWORD {'password' 'timestamp} [, ...]` clause to modify the password history, adding the new password and the time the password was set.

Each login role can have only one profile. To discover the profile that's currently associated with a login role, query the `profile` column of the `DBA_USERS` view.

## Parameters

`name`

  The name of the role with which to associate the specified profile.

`password`

  The password associated with the role.

`profile_name`

  The name of the profile to associate with the role.

`timestamp`

  The date and time at which to enforce the clause. When specifying a value for `timestamp`, enclose the value in single quotes.

## Examples

This command uses the `ALTER USER... PROFILE` command to associate a profile named `acctg` with a user named `john`:

```text
ALTER USER john PROFILE acctg_profile;
```

The following command uses the `ALTER ROLE... PROFILE` command to associate a profile named `acctg` with a user named `john`:

```text
ALTER ROLE john PROFILE acctg_profile;
```
