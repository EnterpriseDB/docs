<div id="dropping_a_profile" class="registered_link"></div>

Use the `DROP PROFILE` command to drop a profile. The syntax is:

```sql
DROP PROFILE [IF EXISTS] <profile_name> [CASCADE|RESTRICT];
```

Include the `IF EXISTS` clause to instruct the server not to throw an error if the specified profile doesn't exist. The server issues a notice if the profile doesn't exist.

Include the optional `CASCADE` clause to reassign any users that are currently associated with the profile to the `default` profile and then drop the profile. Include the optional `RESTRICT` clause to instruct the server not to drop any profile that's associated with a role. This is the default behavior.

## Parameters

`profile_name`

The name of the profile being dropped.

## Examples

This example drops a profile named `acctg_profile`:

```sql
DROP PROFILE acctg_profile CASCADE;
```

The command first reassociates any roles associated with the `acctg_profile` profile with the `default` profile and then drops the `acctg_profile` profile.

The following example drops a profile named `acctg_profile`:

```sql
DROP PROFILE acctg_profile RESTRICT;
```

The `RESTRICT` clause in the command instructs the server not to drop `acctg_profile` if any roles are associated with the profile.
