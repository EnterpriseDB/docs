EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports SQL language that's compatible with Oracle syntax as well as syntax and commands for extended functionality. Extended functionality doesn't provide database compatibility for Oracle or support Oracle-styled applications.

[Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers SQL](/epas/latest/epas_compat_ora_dev_guide) provides detailed information about:

-   Compatible SQL syntax and language elements
-   Data types
-   Supported SQL command syntax
