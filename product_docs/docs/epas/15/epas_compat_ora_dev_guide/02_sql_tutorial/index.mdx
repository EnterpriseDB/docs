EDB Postgres Advanced Server is a *relational database management system* (RDBMS). That means it's a system for managing data stored in *relations*. A relation is essentially a mathematical term for a *table*. The notion of storing data in tables is so commonplace today that it might seem obvious, but there are a number of other ways of organizing databases. Files and directories on Unix-like operating systems form an example of a hierarchical database. A more modern development is the object-oriented database.

Each table is a named collection of *rows*. Each row of a given table has the same set of named *columns*, and each column is of a specific *data type*. Whereas columns have a fixed order in each row, it's important to remember that SQL doesn't guarantee the order of the rows in the table in any way (although you can explicitly sort them for display).

Tables are grouped into *databases*, and a collection of databases managed by a single EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance constitutes a database *cluster*.
