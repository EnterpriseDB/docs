<div id="specifying_a_join_order" class="registered_link"></div>

Include the `ORDERED` directive to instruct the query optimizer to join tables in the order in which they're listed in the `FROM` clause. If you don't include the `ORDERED` keyword, the query optimizer chooses the order in which to join the tables.

For example, the following command allows the optimizer to choose the order in which to join the tables listed in the `FROM` clause:

```sql
SELECT e.ename, d.dname, h.startdate
  FROM emp e, dept d, jobhist h
  WHERE d.deptno = e.deptno
  AND h.empno = e.empno;
```

The following command instructs the optimizer to join the tables in the order specified:

```sql
SELECT /*+ ORDERED */ e.ename, d.dname, h.startdate
  FROM emp e, dept d, jobhist h
  WHERE d.deptno = e.deptno
  AND h.empno = e.empno;
```

In the `ORDERED` version of the command, EDB Postgres Advanced Server first joins `emp e` with `dept d` before joining the results with `jobhist h`. Without the `ORDERED` directive, the query optimizer selects the join order.

!!! Note
    The `ORDERED` directive doesn't work for Oracle-style outer joins (joins that contain a + sign).
