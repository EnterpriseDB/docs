<div id="enabling_audit_logging" class="registered_link"></div>

You can configure EDB Postgres Advanced Server to log all connections, disconnections, DDL statements, DCL statements, DML statements, and any statements resulting in an error.

-  Enable auditing by setting the `edb_audit` parameter to `xml` or `csv`.
-  Set the file rotation day when the new file is created by setting the parameter `edb_audit_rotation_day` to the desired value.
-  To audit all connections, set the parameter `edb_audit_connect` to `all`.
-  To audit all disconnections, set the parameter `edb_audit_disconnect` to `all`.
-  To audit DDL, DCL, DML and other statements, set the parameter `edb_audit_statement` according to the instructions in [Selecting SQL statements to audit](02_selecting_sql_statements_to_audit/#selecting_sql_statements_to_audit).

Setting the `edb_audit_statement` parameter in the configuration file affects the entire database cluster.

You can further refine the type of statements that are audited. The type is controlled by the `edb_audit_statement` parameter according to the database in use as well as the database role running the session:

-   You can set the `edb_audit_statement` parameter as an attribute of a specified database with the `ALTER DATABASE dbname SET edb_audit_statement` command. This setting overrides the `edb_audit_statement` parameter in the configuration file for statements executed when connected to database `dbname`.
-   You can set the `edb_audit_statement` parameter as an attribute of a specified role with the `ALTER ROLE rolename SET edb_audit_statement` command. This setting overrides the `edb_audit_statement` parameter in the configuration file as well as any setting assigned to the database by the `ALTER DATABASE` command when the specified role is running the current session.
-   You can set the `edb_audit_statement` parameter as an attribute of a specified role when using a specified database with the `ALTER ROLE rolename IN DATABASE dbname SET edb_audit_statement` command. This setting overrides the `edb_audit_statement` parameter in the configuration file. It also overrides any setting assigned to the database by the `ALTER DATABASE` command and as any setting assigned to the role with the `ALTER ROLE` command without the `IN DATABASE` clause.

## Examples

The following are examples of this technique.

The database cluster is established with `edb_audit_statement` set to `all` as shown in its `postgresql.conf` file:

```ini
logging_collector = 'on'
edb_audit_statement = 'all'     # Statement type to be audited:
                                # none, dml, insert, update, delete, truncate,
                                # select, error, rollback, ddl, create, drop,
                                # alter, grant, revoke, set, all
                                # {select | update | delete | insert}@groupname
```

A database and role are established with the following settings for the `edb_audit_statement` parameter:

-   Database `auditdb` with `ddl`, `insert`, `update`, and `delete`
-   Role `admin` with `select`, `truncate`, and `set`
-   Role `admin` in database `auditdb` with `create table`, `insert`, and `update`

The following shows creating and altering the database and role:

```sql
$ psql edb enterprisedb
Password for user enterprisedb:
psql.bin (14.0.0)
Type "help" for help.

edb=# SHOW edb_audit_statement;
__OUTPUT__
 edb_audit_statement
---------------------
 all
(1 row)
```
```sql
edb=# CREATE DATABASE auditdb;
CREATE DATABASE
edb=# ALTER DATABASE auditdb SET edb_audit_statement TO 'ddl, insert, update, delete';
ALTER DATABASE
edb=# CREATE ROLE admin WITH LOGIN SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'password';
CREATE ROLE
edb=# ALTER ROLE admin SET edb_audit_statement TO 'select, truncate';
ALTER ROLE
edb=# ALTER ROLE admin IN DATABASE auditdb SET edb_audit_statement TO 'create table, insert, update';
ALTER ROLE
```

The following shows the changes made and the resulting audit log file for three cases.

### Case 1: Changes made in database `auditdb` by role `enterprisedb`

Only `ddl`, `insert`, `update`, and `delete` statements are audited:

```sql
$ psql auditdb enterprisedb
Password for user enterprisedb:
psql.bin (14.0.0)
Type "help" for help.

auditdb=# SHOW edb_audit_statement;
__OUTPUT__
     edb_audit_statement
-----------------------------
 ddl, insert, update, delete
(1 row)
```
```sql
auditdb=# CREATE TABLE audit_tbl (f1 INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, f2 TEXT);
CREATE TABLE
auditdb=# INSERT INTO audit_tbl VALUES (1, 'Row 1');
INSERT 0 1
auditdb=# UPDATE audit_tbl SET f2 = 'Row A' WHERE f1 = 1;
UPDATE 1
auditdb=# SELECT * FROM audit_tbl;                  <== Should not be audited
__OUTPUT__
 f1 |  f2
----+-------
  1 | Row A
(1 row)
```
```sql
auditdb=# TRUNCATE audit_tbl;                       <== Should not be audited
TRUNCATE TABLE
```

The following audit log file shows entries only for the `CREATE TABLE`, `INSERT INTO audit_tbl`, and `UPDATE audit_tbl` statements. The `SELECT * FROM audit_tbl` and `TRUNCATE audit_tbl` statements weren't audited. (Each audit log entry was split and displays across multiple lines. A blank line was inserted between the audit log entries for visual clarity.)

```

### Case 2: Changes made in database `edb` by role `admin`

Only `select`, `truncate`, and `set` statements are audited:

```sql
$ psql edb admin
Password for user admin:
psql.bin (14.0.0)
Type "help" for help.

edb=# SHOW edb_audit_statement;
__OUTPUT__
 edb_audit_statement
-----------------------
 select, truncate, set
(1 row)
```
```sql
edb=# SET default_with_rowids TO TRUE;
SET

edb=# CREATE TABLE edb_tbl (f1 INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, f2 TEXT); <== Should not be audited
CREATE TABLE
edb=# INSERT INTO edb_tbl VALUES (1, 'Row 1');                <== Should not be audited
INSERT 0 1
edb=# SELECT * FROM edb_tbl;
__OUTPUT__
 f1 |  f2
----+-------
  1 | Row 1
(1 row)
```
```sql
edb=# TRUNCATE edb_tbl;
TRUNCATE TABLE
```

Continuation of the audit log file now appears as follows. The last two entries representing the second case show only the `SET default_with_rowids TO TRUE`, `SELECT * FROM edb_tbl`, and `TRUNCATE edb_tbl` statements. The `CREATE TABLE edb_tbl` and `INSERT INTO edb_tbl` statements weren't audited.

```

### Case 3: Changes made in database `auditdb` by role `admin` 

Only `create table`, `insert`, and `update` statements are audited:

```sql
$ psql auditdb admin
Password for user admin:
psql.bin (14.0.0)
Type "help" for help.

auditdb=# SHOW edb_audit_statement;
__OUTPUT__
     edb_audit_statement
------------------------------
 create table, insert, update
(1 row)
```
```sql
auditdb=# CREATE TABLE audit_tbl_2 (f1 INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, f2 TEXT);
CREATE TABLE
auditdb=# INSERT INTO audit_tbl_2 VALUES (1, 'Row 1');
INSERT 0 1
auditdb=# SELECT * FROM audit_tbl_2;                <== Should not be audited
__OUTPUT__
 f1 |  f2
----+-------
  1 | Row 1
(1 row)
```
```sql
auditdb=# TRUNCATE audit_tbl_2;                     <== Should not be audited
TRUNCATE TABLE
```

Continuation of the audit log file now appears as follows. The next-to-last two entries representing the third case show only `CREATE TABLE audit_tbl_2` and `INSERT INTO audit_tbl_2` statements. The `SELECT * FROM audit_tbl_2` and `TRUNCATE audit_tbl_2` statements weren't audited.
