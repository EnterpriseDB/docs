EDB enhanced ECPG (the PostgreSQL precompiler) to create ECPGPlus. ECPGPlus allows you to include Pro\*C-compatible embedded SQL commands in C applications when connected to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server database. When you use ECPGPlus to compile an application, the SQL code syntax is checked and translated into C.

ECPGPlus supports:

-   Oracle Dynamic SQL – Method 4 (ODS-M4)
-   Pro\*C-compatible anonymous blocks
-   A `CALL` statement compatible with Oracle databases

As part of ECPGPlus's Pro\*C compatibility, you don't need to include the `BEGIN DECLARE SECTION` and `END DECLARE SECTION` directives.

## PostgreSQL compatibility

While most ECPGPlus statements work with community PostgreSQL, the `CALL` statement and the `EXECUTE…END EXEC` statement work only when the client application is connected to EDB Postgres Advanced Server.
