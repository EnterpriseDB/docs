ECPGPlus provides two methods to detect and handle errors in embedded SQL code. A client application can:

-   Examine the `sqlca` data structure for error messages and supply customized error handling for your client application.
-   Include `EXEC SQL WHENEVER` directives to instruct the ECPGPlus compiler to add error-handling code.

## Error handling with sqlca

`sqlca` (SQL communications area) is a global variable used by `ecpglib` to communicate information from the server to the client application. After executing a SQL statement such as an `INSERT` or `SELECT` statement, you can inspect the contents of `sqlca` to determine if the statement completed successfully or if the statement failed.

`sqlca` has the following structure:

```text
struct
{
    char sqlcaid[8];
    long sqlabc;
    long sqlcode;
    struct
    {
        int sqlerrml;
        char sqlerrmc[SQLERRMC_LEN];
    } sqlerrm;
    char sqlerrp[8];
    long sqlerrd[6];
    char sqlwarn[8];
    char sqlstate[5];

} sqlca;
```

Use the following directive to implement `sqlca` functionality:

```text
EXEC SQL INCLUDE sqlca;
```

If you include the `ecpg` directive, you don't need to `#include` the `sqlca.h` file in the client application's header declaration.

The EDB Postgres Advanced Server `sqlca` structure contains the following members:

-  `sqlcaid` &mdash; Contains the string: `"SQLCA"`.

-  `sqlabc` &mdash; `sqlabc` contains the size of the `sqlca` structure.

-  `sqlcode` &mdash; The `sqlcode` member was deprecated with SQL 92. EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports `sqlcode` for backward compatibility. Use the `sqlstate` member when writing new code.

    `sqlcode` is an integer value. A positive `sqlcode` value indicates that the client application encountered a harmless processing condition. A negative value indicates a warning or error.

    If a statement processes without error, `sqlcode` contains a value of `0`. If the client application encounters an error or warning during a statement's execution, `sqlcode` contains the last code returned.

    The SQL standard defines only a positive value of 100, which indicates that the most recent SQL statement processed returned or affected no rows. Since the SQL standard doesn't define other `sqlcode` values, be aware that the values assigned to each condition can vary from database to database.

`sqlerrm` is a structure embedded in `sqlca`, composed of two members:

-  `sqlerrml` &mdash; Contains the length of the error message currently stored in `sqlerrmc`.

-  `sqlerrmc` &mdash; Contains the null-terminated message text associated with the code stored in `sqlstate`. If a message exceeds 149 characters, `ecpglib` truncates the error message.

-  `sqlerrp` &mdash; Contains the string `"NOT SET"`.

`sqlerrd` is an array that contains six elements:

-   `sqlerrd[1]` &mdash; Contains the OID of the processed row (if applicable).

-   `sqlerrd[2]` &mdash; Contains the number of processed or returned rows.

-   `sqlerrd[0]`, `sqlerrd[3]`, `sqlerrd[4]` and `sqlerrd[5]` are unused.

`sqlwarn` is an array that contains 8 characters:

-   `sqlwarn[0]` &mdash; Contains a value of `'W'` if any other element in `sqlwarn` is set to `'W'`.

-   `sqlwarn[1]` &mdash; Contains a value of `'W'` if a data value was truncated when it was stored in a host variable.

-   `sqlwarn[2]` &mdash; Contains a value of `'W'` if the client application encounters a nonfatal warning.

-   `sqlwarn[3]`, `sqlwarn[4]`, `sqlwarn[5]`, `sqlwarn[6]`, and `sqlwarn[7]` are unused.

`sqlstate` is a five-character array that contains a SQL-compliant status code after the execution of a statement from the client application. If a statement processes without error, `sqlstate` contains a value of `00000`. `sqlstate` isn't a null-terminated string.

`sqlstate` codes are assigned in a hierarchical scheme:

-   The first two characters of `sqlstate` indicate the general class of the condition.
-   The last three characters of `sqlstate` indicate a specific status within the class.

If the client application encounters multiple errors (or warnings) during an SQL statement's execution, `sqlstate` contains the last code returned.

The following table lists the `sqlstate` and `sqlcode` values, as well as the symbolic name and error description for the related condition.

## EXEC SQL WHENEVER

Use the `EXEC SQL WHENEVER` directive to implement simple error handling for client applications compiled with ECPGPlus. The syntax of the directive is:

```text
EXEC SQL WHENEVER <condition> <action>;
```

This directive instructs the ECPG compiler to insert error-handling code into your program.

The code instructs the client application to perform a specified action if the client application detects a given condition. The *condition* can be one of the following:

`SQLERROR`

 A `SQLERROR` condition exists when `sqlca.sqlcode` is less than zero.

`SQLWARNING`

 A `SQLWARNING` condition exists when `sqlca.sqlwarn[0]` contains a `'W'`.

`NOT FOUND`

 A `NOT FOUND` condition exists when `sqlca.sqlcode` is `ECPG_NOT_FOUND` (when a query returns no data).

You can specify that the client application perform one of the following *actions* if it encounters one of the previous conditions:

`CONTINUE`

 Specify `CONTINUE` to instruct the client application to continue processing, ignoring the current `condition`. `CONTINUE` is the default action.

`DO CONTINUE`

 An action of `DO CONTINUE` generates a `CONTINUE` statement in the emitted C code. If it encounters the condition, it skips the rest of the code in the loop and continues with the next iteration. You can use it only in a loop.

`GOTO label` or `GO TO label`

 Use a C `goto` statement to jump to the specified `label`.

`SQLPRINT`

 Print an error message to `stderr` (standard error), using the `sqlprint()` function. The `sqlprint()` function prints `sql error` followed by the contents of `sqlca.sqlerrm.sqlerrmc`.

`STOP`

 Call `exit(1)` to signal an error and terminate the program.

`DO BREAK`

 Execute the C `break` statement. Use this action in loops or `switch` statements.

`CALL name(args)` or `DO name(args)`

 Invoke the C function specified by the name `parameter`, using the parameters specified in the `args` parameter.

## Example

The following code fragment prints a message if the client application encounters a warning and aborts the application if it encounters an error:

```text
EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLWARNING SQLPRINT;
EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR STOP;
```

!!! Note
    The ECPGPlus compiler processes your program from top to bottom, even though the client application might not execute from top to bottom. The compiler directive is applied to each line in order and remains in effect until the compiler encounters another directive. If the control of the flow in your program isn't top to bottom, consider adding error-handling directives to any parts of the program that might be missed during compiling.
