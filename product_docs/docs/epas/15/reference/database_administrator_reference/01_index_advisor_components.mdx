The Index Advisor shared library interacts with the query planner to make indexing recommendations. 

On Windows, the EDB Postgres Advanced Server installer creates the shared library in the `libdir` subdirectory of your EDB Postgres Advanced Server home directory. The shared library is:

`index_advisor.dll`

For Linux, install the `edb-asxx-server-indexadvisor` RPM package, where `xx` is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version number. The shared library is:

`index_advisor.so`

Only a superuser can load libraries in the `libdir` directory. A database administrator can allow a non-superuser to use Index Advisor by manually copying the Index Advisor file from the `libdir` directory into the `libdir/plugins` directory under your EDB Postgres Advanced Server home directory. Only allow a trusted non-superuser to have access to the plugin. This is an unsafe practice in a production environment.

The installer also creates the Index Advisor utility program and setup script:

`pg_advise_index`

 A utility program that reads a user-supplied input file containing SQL queries and produces a text file containing `CREATE INDEX` statements. You can use these statements to create the indexes recommended by the Index Advisor. The `pg_advise_index` program is located in the `bin` subdirectory of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server home directory.

!!! Note
    `pg_advise_index` asks the backend process to load the index_advisor plugin first from `$libdir/plugins`. If not found, then it writes the error in the server log file and attempts to load from `$libdir`.

`index_advisor_log`

 Index Advisor logs indexing recommendations in the `index_advisor_log` table. If Index Advisor doesn't find the `index_advisor_log` table in the user's search path, it stores any indexing recommendations in a temporary table of the same name. The temporary table exists only for rest of the current session.

`show_index_recommendations()`

 A PL/pgSQL function that interprets and displays the recommendations made during a specific Index Advisor session, as identified by its backend process ID.

`index_recommendations`

 Index Advisor creates the `index_recommendations` view based on information stored in the `index_advisor_log` table during a query analysis. The view produces output in the same format as the `show_index_recommendations()` function but contains Index Advisor recommendations for all stored sessions. The result set returned by the `show_index_recommendations()` function is limited to a specified session.
