Use the following configuration parameters to control database auditing. See [Summary of configuration parameters](/epas/latest/reference/database_administrator_reference/02_summary_of_configuration_parameters/) to determine if a change to the configuration parameter:

- Takes effect immediately 
- Requires reloading the configuration
- Requires restarting the database server

`edb_audit`

 Enables or disables database auditing. The values `xml` or `csv` enable database auditing. These values represent the file format in which to capture auditing information. `none` disables database auditing and is the default.

!!! Note
    Set the `logging_collector` parameter to `on` to enable the `edb_audit` parameter.

`edb_audit_archiver` 

 Enables or disables database audit archiving.

`edb_audit_archiver_timeout` 

 Enforces a timeout in seconds when a database attempts to archive a log file. The valid range is 30 seconds to one day.

`edb_audit_archiver_filename_prefix`

 Specifies the file name of an audit log file that needs to be archived. The file name must align with the `edb_audit_filename` parameter. The default value for `edb_audit_archiver_filename_prefix` is `audit-`. The audit files with `edb_audit_archiver_filename_prefix` in the `edb_audit_directory` are eligible for compression and expiration.

`edb_audit_archiver_compress_time_limit`

 Specifies the time in seconds after which audit logs are eligible for compression. The possible values are: 
 
 - `0` &mdash; Compression starts as soon as the log file isn't a current file. 
 - `-1` &mdash; Compression of the log file on a timely basis doesn't occur.

`edb_audit_archiver_compress_size_limit`

Specifies a file size threshold, in megabytes, after which audit logs are eligible for compression. If you have multiple audit logs whose combined size exceeds the threshold, the individual files are eligible for compression even though the size of each individual audit log may not meet the threshold. 
 
If the parameter is set to `-1`, compression of the log file on a size basis doesn't occur. 

`edb_audit_archiver_compress_command`

 Specifies the command to execute compression of the audit log files. The default value for `edb_audit_archiver_compress_command` is `gzip %p`. The `gzip` provides a standard method of compressing files. The `%p` in the string is replaced with the path name of the file to archive.

`edb_audit_archiver_compress_suffix`

 Specifies the file name of an already compressed log file. The file name must align with `edb_audit_archiver_compress_command`. The default file name is `.gz`.

`edb_audit_archiver_expire_time_limit`

 Specifies the time, in seconds, after which audit logs are eligible to expire. The possible values to set this parameter are: 
 
 - `0` &mdash; Expiration starts as soon as the log file isn't a current file. 
 - `-1` &mdash; Expiration of the log file on a timely basis doesn't occur.

`edb_audit_archiver_expire_size_limit` 

 Specifies a file size threshold in megabytes, after which audit logs are eligible to expire. If you have multiple audit logs whose combined size exceeds the threshold, the individual files are eligible for expiration even though the size of each individual audit log may not meet the threshold.
 
 If the parameter is set to `-1`, expiration of a log file on the size basis doesn't occur. 

`edb_audit_archiver_expire_command`

 Specifies the command to execute on an expired audit log file before removal.

`edb_audit_archiver_sort_file`

 Identifies the oldest log file to sort alphabetically or based on `mtime`. `mtime` indicates sorting of files based on file modification time. `alphabetic` indicates sorting of files alphabetically based on the file name.

`edb_audit_directory`

 Specifies the directory where the log files are created. The path of the directory can be relative to the data folder or absolute. The default is the `PGDATA/edb_audit` directory.

`edb_audit_filename`

 Specifies the file name of the audit file where the auditing information are stored. The default file name is `audit-%Y%m%d_%H%M%S`. The escape sequences `%Y`, `%m`, and so on are replaced by the appropriate current values according to the system date and time.

`edb_audit_rotation_day`

 Specifies the day of the week on which to rotate the audit files. Valid values are `sun`, `mon`, `tue`, `wed`, `thu`, `fri`, `sat`, `every`, and `none`. To disable rotation, set the value to `none`. To rotate the file every day, set the `edb_audit_rotation_day` value to `every`. To rotate the file on a specific day of the week, set the value to the desired day of the week. `every` is the default value.

`edb_audit_rotation_size`

 Specifies a file size threshold, in megabytes, when file rotation is forced to occur. The default value is 0 MB. If the parameter is commented out or set to 0, rotation of the file on a size basis doesn't occur.

`edb_audit_rotation_seconds`

 Specifies the rotation time in seconds to create a log file. To disable this feature, set this parameter to `0`, which is the default.

`edb_audit_connect`

 Enables auditing of database connection attempts by users. To disable auditing of all connection attempts, set `edb_audit_connect` to `none`. To audit all connection attempts, set the value to `all`. To audit all failed connection attempts, set the value to `failed`, which is the default. 

`edb_audit_disconnect`

 Enables auditing of database disconnections by connected users. To enable auditing of disconnections, set the value to `all`. To disable, set the value to `none`, which is the default.

`edb_audit_statement`

 Specifies auditing of different categories of SQL statements. You can specify various combinations of the following values: `none`, `dml`, `insert`, `update`, `delete`, `truncate`, `select`, `error`, `rollback`, `ddl`, `create`, `drop`, `alter`, `grant`, `revoke`, `set`, `all`, and `{ select | update | delete | insert }@groupname`. The default is `ddl` and `error`. See [Selecting SQL statements to audit](/epas/latest/epas_security_guide/05_edb_audit_logging/02_selecting_sql_statements_to_audit/) for information about setting this parameter.

`edb_audit_tag`

 Specifies a string value to include in the audit log file for each entry as a tracking tag.

`edb_log_every_bulk_value`

 Bulk processing logs the resulting statements into both the EDB Postgres Advanced Server log file and the EDB Audit log file. However, logging every statement in bulk processing is costly. You can control this with the `edb_log_every_bulk_value` configuration parameter. When set to `true`, every statement in bulk processing is logged. During bulk execution, when `edb_log_every_bulk_value` is set to `false`, a log message is recorded once per bulk processing along with the number of rows processed. In addition, the duration is emitted once per bulk processing. Default is `false`.

`edb_audit_destination`

 Specifies whether to record the audit log information in the directory as given by the `edb_audit_directory` parameter or to the directory and file managed by the `syslog` process. Set to `file` to use the directory specified by `edb_audit_directory`, which is the default setting.

 Set to `syslog` to use the syslog process and its location as configured in the `/etc/syslog.conf` file. The `syslog` setting is valid for EDB Postgres Advanced Server running on a Linux host and isn't supported on Windows systems. 
 
 !!! Note
    In recent Linux versions, syslog was replaced with `rsyslog`, and the configuration file is in `/etc/rsyslog.conf`.

!!! Note
    EDB Postgres Advanced Server allows administrative users associated with administrative privileges to audit statements by any user, group, or role. By auditing specific users, you can minimize the number of audit records generated. For information, see the examples under [Selecting SQL statements to audit](/epas/latest/epas_security_guide/05_edb_audit_logging/02_selecting_sql_statements_to_audit/).
