<div id="summary_of_configuration_parameters" class="registered_link"></div>

This summary table list all EDB Postgres Advanced Server configuration parameters along with a number of key attributes of the parameters.

These attributes are described by the following columns of the summary table:

-   Parameter. Configuration parameter name and a brief description of the configuration parameter. Parameters for use only with EPAS are denoted by (EPAS only).

-   Scope. Scope of effect of the configuration parameter setting:

    -  `Cluster` &mdash; Setting affects the entire database cluster, that is, all databases managed by the database server instance.
    -  `Database` &mdash; Setting can vary by database and is established when the database is created. Applies to a small number of parameters related to locale settings.
    -  `Session` &mdash; Setting can vary down to the granularity of individual sessions.

    In other words, different settings can be made for the following entities in which the latter settings in this list override prior ones: 
    
    -  The entire database cluster 
    -  Specific databases in the database cluster
    -  Specific roles
    -  Specific roles when connected to specific databases
    -  A specific session

-   In effect. When a changed parameter setting takes effect:

    -  `Preset` &mdash; Established when the EDB Postgres Advanced Server product is built or a particular database is created. This is a read-only parameter and can't be changed.
    -  `Restart` &mdash; You must restart the database server.
    -  `Reload` &mdash; You must reload configuration file or restart the database server.
    -  `Immediately` &mdash; Immediately effective in a session if the `PGOPTIONS` environment variable or the `SET` command is used to change the setting in the current session. Effective in new sessions if `ALTER DATABASE`, `ALTER ROLE`, or `ALTER ROLE IN DATABASE` commands are used to change the setting.

-   Used by. Type of operating system account or database role that must be used to put the parameter setting into effect.

    -  `EPAS account` &mdash; The EDB Postgres Advanced Server service account (`enterprisedb` for an installation compatible with Oracle databases, `postgres` for a PostgreSQL compatible mode installation).
    -  `Superuser` &mdash; Database role with superuser privileges.
    -  `User` &mdash; Any database role with permissions on the affected database object, that is, the database or role to alter with the `ALTER` command.
    -  `n/a` &mdash; No user can change the parameter setting.

!!! Note
    Some parameters can never be altered. These are designated as **Note: For internal use only** in the description.
