In Oracle, when a runtime error occurs in a SQL command, all the updates on the database caused by that single command are rolled back. This is called *statement level transaction isolation*. For example, if a single `UPDATE` command successfully updates five rows but an attempt to update a sixth row results in an exception, the updates to all six rows made by this `UPDATE` command are rolled back. The effects of prior SQL commands that weren't yet committed or rolled back are pending until a `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` command is executed.

In PostgreSQL, if an exception occurs while executing a SQL command, all the updates on the database since the start of the transaction are rolled back. In addition, the transaction is left in an aborted state, and either a `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` command must be issued before another transaction can start.

If `edb_stmt_level_tx` is set to `TRUE`, then an exception doesn't automatically roll back prior uncommitted database updates, emulating the Oracle behavior. If `edb_stmt_level_tx` is set to `FALSE`, then an exception rolls back uncommitted database updates.

!!! Note
    Use `edb_stmt_level_tx` set to `TRUE` only when necessary, as this setting can have a negative performance impact.

The following example run in PSQL shows that when `edb_stmt_level_tx` is `FALSE`, the abort of the second `INSERT` command also rolls back the first `INSERT` command. In PSQL, the command `\set AUTOCOMMIT off` must be issued, otherwise every statement commits automatically, which defeats the purpose of showing the effect of `edb_stmt_level_tx`.

```sql
\set AUTOCOMMIT off
SET edb_stmt_level_tx TO off;

INSERT INTO emp (empno,ename,deptno) VALUES (9001, 'JONES', 40);
INSERT INTO emp (empno,ename,deptno) VALUES (9002, 'JONES', 00);
ERROR:  insert or update on table "emp" violates foreign key constraint
"emp_ref_dept_fk"
DETAIL:  Key (deptno)=(0) is not present in table "dept".

COMMIT;
SELECT empno, ename, deptno FROM emp WHERE empno > 9000;
__OUTPUT__
empno  | ename | deptno
-------+-------+--------
(0 rows)
```

In the following example, with `edb_stmt_level_tx` set to `TRUE`, the first `INSERT` command wasn't rolled back after the error on the second `INSERT` command. At this point, the first `INSERT` command can either be committed or rolled back.

```sql
\set AUTOCOMMIT off
SET edb_stmt_level_tx TO on;

INSERT INTO emp (empno,ename,deptno) VALUES (9001, 'JONES', 40);
INSERT INTO emp (empno,ename,deptno) VALUES (9002, 'JONES', 00);
ERROR:  insert or update on table "emp" violates foreign key constraint
"emp_ref_dept_fk"
DETAIL:  Key (deptno)=(0) is not present in table "dept".

SELECT empno, ename, deptno FROM emp WHERE empno > 9000;
__OUTPUT__
empno  | ename | deptno
-------+-------+--------
9001   | JONES |     40
(1 row)

COMMIT;
```

You can issue a `ROLLBACK` command instead of the `COMMIT` command. In that case, the insertion of employee number `9001` is rolled back as well.
