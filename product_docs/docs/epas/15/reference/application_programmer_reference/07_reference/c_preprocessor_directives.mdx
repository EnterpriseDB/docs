title: "C-preprocessor directives"
---

The ECPGPlus C-preprocessor enforces two behaviors that depend on the mode in which you invoke ECPGPlus:

-   `PROC` mode
-   Non-`PROC` mode

## Compiling in PROC mode

In `PROC` mode, ECPGPlus allows you to:

-   Declare host variables outside of an `EXEC SQL BEGIN/END DECLARE SECTION`.
-   Use any C variable as a host variable as long as its data type is compatible with ECPG.

When you invoke ECPGPlus in `PROC` mode (by including the `-C PROC` keywords), the ECPG compiler honors the following C-preprocessor directives:

```c
#include
#if expression
#ifdef symbolName
#ifndef symbolName
#else
#elif expression
#endif
#define symbolName expansion
#define symbolName([macro arguments]) expansion
#undef symbolName
#defined(symbolName)
```

Preprocessor directives are used to affect or direct the code that's received by the compiler. For example, consider the following code sample:

```c
#if HAVE_LONG_LONG == 1
#define BALANCE_TYPE long long
#else
#define BALANCE_TYPE double
#endif
...
BALANCE_TYPE customerBalance;
```

Suppose you invoke ECPGPlus with the following command-line arguments:

```shell
ecpg –C PROC –DHAVE_LONG_LONG=1
```

ECPGPlus copies the entire fragment, without change, to the output file. It sends only the following tokens to the ECPG parser:

```shell
long long customerBalance;
```

On the other hand, suppose you invoke ECPGPlus with the following command-line arguments:

```shell
ecpg –C PROC –DHAVE_LONG_LONG=0
```

The ECPG parser receives the following tokens:

```shell
double customerBalance;
```

If your code uses preprocessor directives to filter the code that's sent to the compiler, the complete code is retained in the original code, while the ECPG parser sees only the processed token stream.

You can also use compatible syntax when executing the following preprocessor directives with an `EXEC` directive:

```sql
EXEC ORACLE DEFINE
EXEC ORACLE UNDEF
EXEC ORACLE INCLUDE
EXEC ORACLE IFDEF
EXEC ORACLE IFNDEF
EXEC ORACLE ELIF
EXEC ORACLE ELSE
EXEC ORACLE ENDIF
EXEC ORACLE OPTION
```

For example, suppose your code includes the following:

```sql
EXEC ORACLE IFDEF HAVE_LONG_LONG;
#define BALANCE_TYPE long long
EXEC ORACLE ENDIF;
BALANCE_TYPE customerBalance;
```

You invoke ECPGPlus with the following command-line arguments:

```shell
ecpg –C PROC DEFINE=HAVE_LONG_LONG=1
```

ECPGPlus sends the following tokens to the output file and the ECPG parser:

```c
long long customerBalance;
```

!!! Note
    The `EXEC ORACLE` preprocessor directives work only if you specify `-C PROC` on the ECPG command line.

## Using the SELECT_ERROR precompiler option

When using ECPGPlus in compatible mode, you can use the `SELECT_ERROR` precompiler option to tell your program how to handle result sets that contain more rows than the host variable can accommodate. The syntax is:

```ini
SELECT_ERROR={YES|NO}
```

The default value is `YES`. A `SELECT` statement returns an error message if the result set exceeds the capacity of the host variable. Specify `NO` to suppress error messages when a `SELECT` statement returns more rows than a host variable can accommodate.

Use `SELECT_ERROR` with the `EXEC ORACLE OPTION` directive.

## Compiling in non-PROC mode

If you don't include the `-C PROC` command-line option:

-   C preprocessor directives are copied to the output file without change.
-   You must declare the type and name of each C variable that you intend to use as a host variable in an `EXEC SQL BEGIN/END DECLARE` section.

When invoked in non-`PROC` mode, ECPG implements the behavior described in the PostgreSQL core documentation.
