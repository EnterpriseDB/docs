An ECPGPlus application must deal with two sets of data types: SQL data types (such as `SMALLINT`, `DOUBLE PRECISION`, and `CHARACTER VARYING`) and C data types (like `short`, `double`, and `varchar[n]`). When an application fetches data from the server, ECPGPlus maps each SQL data type to the type of the C variable into which the data is returned.

In general, ECPGPlus can convert most SQL server types into similar C types, but not all combinations are valid. For example, ECPGPlus tries to convert a SQL character value into a C integer value, but the conversion might fail at execution time if the SQL character value contains non-numeric characters. 

The reverse is also true. When an application sends a value to the server, ECPGPlus tries to convert the C data type into the required SQL type. Again, the conversion might fail at execution time if the C value can't be converted into the required SQL type.

ECPGPlus can convert any SQL type into C character values (`char[n]` or `varchar[n]`). Although it's safe to convert any SQL type to or from `char[n]` or `varchar[n]`, it's often convenient to use more natural C types such as `int`, `double`, or `float`.

The supported C data types are:

-   `short`
-   `int`
-   `unsigned int`
-   `long long int`
-   `float`
-   `double`
-   `char[n+1]`
-   `varchar[n+1]`
-   `bool`
-   Any equivalent created by a `typedef`

In addition to the numeric and character types supported by C, the `pgtypeslib` runtime library offers custom data types, as well as functions to operate on those types, for dealing with date/time and exact numeric values:

-   `timestamp`
-   `interval`
-   `date`
-   `decimal`
-   `numeric`

To use a data type supplied by `pgtypeslib`, you must `#include` the proper header file.
