<div id="the_sql_language" class="registered_link"></div>

A subset of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server SQL language is compatible with Oracle databases. These SQL syntaxes, data types, and functions work in both EDB Postgres Advanced Server and Oracle.

!!! Note
    The EDB Postgres Advanced Server also includes syntax and commands for extended functionality (functionality that doesn't provide database compatibility for Oracle or support Oracle-styled applications) that aren't included here.
