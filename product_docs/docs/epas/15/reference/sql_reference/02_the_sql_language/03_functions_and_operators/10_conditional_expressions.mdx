SQL-compliant conditional expressions are available in EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

## CASE

The SQL `CASE` expression is a generic conditional expression, similar to if/else statements in other languages:

```sql
CASE WHEN condition THEN result
   [ WHEN ... ]
   [ ELSE result ]
END
```

You can use `CASE` clauses wherever an expression is valid. `condition` is an expression that returns a `BOOLEAN` result. If the result is `TRUE`, then the value of the `CASE` expression is the `result` that follows the condition. If the result is `FALSE`, any subsequent `WHEN` clauses are searched in the same manner. If `no WHEN condition` is `TRUE`, then the value of the `CASE` expression is the `result` in the `ELSE` clause. If the `ELSE` clause is omitted and no condition matches, the result is `NULL`.

For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM test;
__OUTPUT__
 a
---
 1
 2
 3
(3 rows)
```
```sql
SELECT a,
    CASE WHEN a=1 THEN 'one'
         WHEN a=2 THEN 'two'
         ELSE 'other'
    END
FROM test;
__OUTPUT__
 a | case
---+-------
 1 | one
 2 | two
 3 | other
(3 rows)
```

The data types of all the `result` expressions must be convertible to a single output type.

The following simple `CASE` expression is a specialized variant of the general form:

```sql
CASE expression
    WHEN value THEN result
  [ WHEN ... ]
  [ ELSE result ]
END
```

The `expression` is computed and compared to all the `value` specifications in the `WHEN` clauses until one is found that is equal. If no match is found, the `result` in the `ELSE` clause (or a null value) is returned.

This same example can be written using the simple `CASE` syntax:

```sql
SELECT a,
    CASE a WHEN 1 THEN 'one'
           WHEN 2 THEN 'two'
           ELSE 'other'
    END
FROM test;
__OUTPUT__
 a | case
---+-------
 1 | one
 2 | two
 3 | other
(3 rows)
```

A `CASE` expression doesn't evaluate any subexpressions that aren't needed to determine the result. For example, this is a possible way of avoiding a division-by-zero failure:

```sql
SELECT ... WHERE CASE WHEN x <> 0 THEN y/x > 1.5 ELSE false END;
```

## COALESCE

The `COALESCE` function returns the first of its arguments that isn't null. Null is returned only if all arguments are null.

```sql
COALESCE(value [, value2 ] ... )
```

It's often used to substitute a default value for null values when data is retrieved for display or further computation. For example:

```sql
SELECT COALESCE(description, short_description, '(none)') ...
```

Like a `CASE` expression, `COALESCE` doesn't evaluate arguments that aren't needed to determine the result. Arguments to the right of the first non-null argument aren't evaluated. This SQL-standard function provides capabilities similar to `NVL` and `IFNULL`, which are used in some other database systems.

## NULLIF

The `NULLIF` function returns a null value if `value1` and `value2` are equal. Otherwise it returns `value1`.

```sql
NULLIF(value1, value2)
```

You can use this to perform the inverse operation of the `COALESCE` example:

```sql
SELECT NULLIF(value1, '(none)') ...
```

If `value1` is (none), return a null. Otherwise return `value1`.

## NVL

The `NVL` function returns the first of its arguments that isn't null. `NVL` evaluates the first expression. If that expression evaluates to `NULL`, `NVL` returns the second expression.

```sql
NVL(expr1, expr2)
```

The return type is the same as the argument types. All arguments must have the same data type or be coercible to a common type. `NVL` returns `NULL` if all arguments are `NULL`. `''` is considered as unknown, and if the arguments data type aren't coercible to the common data type, then `NVL` throws an error.

### Examples

This example computes a bonus for noncommissioned employees. If an employee is a commissioned employee, this expression returns the employee's commission. If the employee isn't a commissioned employee, that is, their commission is `NULL`, this expression returns a bonus that's 10% of their salary.

```text
bonus = NVL(emp.commission, emp.salary * .10)
```

In this example, the type of `1` is numeric and the type of `''` is considered as unknown. Therefore PostgreSQL decides that the common type is numeric. It tries to interpret the empty string as a numeric value, which produces the indicated error:

```sql
edb=# select nvl('',1);
ERROR:  invalid input syntax for type numeric: ""
```

In this example, if `33` is type casted to double precision, it converts to double precision and returns the value as double precision. If `33` is type casted to numeric, it converts to numeric and returns the value as numeric.

```sql
edb=# select NVL(33::double precision,0), pg_typeof(NVL(33::double precision,0)), pg_typeof(NVL(33::numeric,0));
__OUTPUT__
 nvl |    pg_typeof     | pg_typeof
-----+------------------+-----------
  33 | double precision | numeric
(1 row)
```

## NVL2

`NVL2` evaluates an expression and returns either the second or third expression, depending on the value of the first expression. If the first expression isn't `NULL`, `NVL2` returns the value in `expr2`. If the first expression is `NULL`, `NVL2` returns the value in `expr3`.

```sql
NVL2(expr1, expr2, expr3)
```

The return type is the same as the argument types. All arguments must have the same data type or be coercible to a common type.

This example computes a bonus for commissioned employees. If a given employee is a commissioned employee, this expression returns an amount equal to 110% of their commission. If the employee isn't a commissioned employee, that is, their commission is `NULL`, this expression returns `0`.

```sql
bonus = NVL2(emp.commission, emp.commission * 1.1, 0)
```

## GREATEST and LEAST

The `GREATEST` and `LEAST` functions select the largest or smallest value from a list of any number of expressions.

```sql
GREATEST(value [, value2 ] ... )
LEAST(value [, value2 ] ... )
```

All of the expressions must be convertible to a common data type, which becomes the type of the result. Null values in the list are ignored. The result is null only if all the expressions evaluate to null.

!!! Note
    The `GREATEST` and `LEAST` aren't in the SQL standard but are a common extension.
