Where `n` is a positive integer, these types can store strings up to `n` characters in length. An attempt to assign a value that exceeds the length of `n` results in an error, unless the excess characters are all spaces. In this case, the string is truncated to the maximum length.

## Overview

The storage requirement for data of these types is the actual string plus 1 byte if the string is less than 127 bytes or 4 bytes if the string is 127 bytes or greater. In the case of `CHAR`, the padding also requires storage. Long strings are compressed by the system automatically, so the physical requirement on disk might be less. Long values are stored in background tables so they don't interfere with rapid access to the shorter column values.

The database character set determines the character set used to store textual values.

`CHAR`

 If you don't specify a value for `n`, `n` defaults to `1`. If the string to assign is shorter than `n`, values of type `CHAR` are space-padded to the specified width (`n`) and are stored and displayed that way.

 Padding spaces are treated as semantically insignificant. That is, trailing spaces are disregarded when comparing two values of type `CHAR`, and they are removed when converting a `CHAR` value to one of the other string types.

 If you explicitly cast an over-length value to a `CHAR(n)` type, the value is truncated to `n` characters without raising an error (as specified by the SQL standard).

```sql
VARCHAR, VARCHAR2, NVARCHAR and NVARCHAR2
```

 If the string to assign is shorter than `n`, values of type `VARCHAR`, `VARCHAR2`, `NVARCHAR`, and `NVARCHAR2` store the shorter string without padding.

!!! Note
The trailing spaces are semantically significant in `VARCHAR` values.

 If you explicitly cast a value to a `VARCHAR` type, an over-length value is truncated to `n` characters without raising an error (as specified by the SQL standard).

`CLOB`

 You can store a large character string in a `CLOB` type. `CLOB` is semantically equivalent to `VARCHAR2` except no length limit is specified. Generally, use a `CLOB` type if you don't know the maximum string length.

 The longest possible character string that you can store in a `CLOB` type is about 1 GB.

!!!Note 
   The `CLOB` data type is actually a `DOMAIN` based on the PostgreSQL `TEXT` data type. For information on a `DOMAIN`, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createdomain.html).

 Thus, use of the `CLOB` type is limited by what can be done for `TEXT`, such as a maximum size of approximately 1 GB.

 For larger amounts of data, instead of using the `CLOB` data type, use the PostgreSQL *large objects* feature that relies on the `pg_largeobject` system catalog. For information on large objects, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/largeobjects.html).
