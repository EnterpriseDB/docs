The `WRITE` procedure writes data into a large object. Any existing data in the large object at the specified offset for the given length is overwritten by data given in the buffer.

```sql
WRITE(<lob_loc> IN OUT { BLOB | CLOB },
  <amount> BINARY_INTEGER,
  <offset> INTEGER, <buffer> { RAW | VARCHAR2 })
```

## Parameters

`lob_loc`

 Large object locator of the large object to write.

`amount`

 The number of bytes/characters in `buffer` to write to the large object.

`offset`

 The offset in bytes/characters from the beginning of the large object (origin is 1) for the write operation to begin.

`buffer`

 Contains data to write to the large object. If `lob_loc` is a `BLOB`, then `buffer` must be `RAW`. If `lob_loc` is a `CLOB`, then `buffer` must be `VARCHAR2`.
