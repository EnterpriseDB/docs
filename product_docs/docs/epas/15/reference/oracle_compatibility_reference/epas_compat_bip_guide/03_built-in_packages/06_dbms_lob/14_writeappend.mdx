The `WRITEAPPEND` procedure adds data to the end of a large object.

```sql
WRITEAPPEND(<lob_loc> IN OUT { BLOB | CLOB },
  <amount> BINARY_INTEGER, <buffer> { RAW | VARCHAR2 })
```

## Parameters

`lob_loc`

 Large object locator of the large object to which you want to append the data.

`amount`

 Number of bytes/characters from `buffer` to append to the large object.

`buffer`

 Data to append to the large object. If `lob_loc` is a `BLOB`, then `buffer` must be `RAW`. If `lob_loc` is a `CLOB`, then `buffer` must be `VARCHAR2`.
