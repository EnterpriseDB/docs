Use the `DROP_QUEUE` procedure to delete a queue. The signature is:

```sql
DROP_QUEUE(
  <queue_name>  IN VARCHAR2,
  <auto_commit> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE)
```

## Parameters

`queue_name`

 The name of the queue that you want to drop.

`auto_commit`

 `auto_commit` is accepted for compatibility but is ignored.

## Example

The following anonymous block drops the queue named `work_order`:

```sql
BEGIN
DBMS_AQADM.DROP_QUEUE(queue_name => 'work_order');
END;
```
