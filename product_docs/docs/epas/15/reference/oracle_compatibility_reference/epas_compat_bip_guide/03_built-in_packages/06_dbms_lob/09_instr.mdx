The `INSTR` function returns the location of the nth occurrence of a given pattern in a large object.

```sql
<position> INTEGER INSTR(<lob_loc> { BLOB | CLOB },
   <pattern> { RAW | VARCHAR2 } [, <offset> INTEGER [, <nth> INTEGER ]])
```

## Parameters

`lob_loc`

 Large object locator of the large object in which to search for `pattern`.

`pattern`

 Pattern of bytes or characters to match against the large object, `lob`. `pattern` must be `RAW` if `lob_loc` is a `BLOB`. `pattern` must be `VARCHAR2` if `lob_loc` is a `CLOB`.

`offset`

 Position in `lob_loc` to start search for `pattern`. The first byte/character is position 1. The default is 1.

`nth`

 Search for `pattern`, `nth` number of times starting at the position given by `offset`. The default is 1.

`position`

 Position in the large object where `pattern` appears the `nth` time, starting from the position given by `offset`.
