The `READ` procedure reads a portion of a large object into a buffer.

```sql
READ(<lob_loc> { BLOB | CLOB }, <amount> IN OUT BINARY_INTEGER,
  <offset> INTEGER, <buffer> OUT { RAW | VARCHAR2 })
```

## Parameters

`lob_loc`

 Large object locator of the large object to read.

`amount IN`

 Number of bytes/characters to read.

`amount OUT`

 Number of bytes/characters read. If there's no more data to read, then `amount` returns `0` and a `DATA_NOT_FOUND` exception is thrown.

`offset`

 Position to begin reading. The first byte/character is position 1.

`buffer`

 Variable to receive the large object. If `lob_loc` is a `BLOB`, then `buffer` must be `RAW`. If `lob_loc` is a `CLOB`, then `buffer` must be `VARCHAR2`.
