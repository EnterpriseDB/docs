The `COMPARE` procedure performs an exact byte-by-byte comparison of two large objects for a given length at given offsets. The large objects being compared must be the same data type.

```sql
<status> INTEGER COMPARE(<lob_1> { BLOB | CLOB },
   <lob_2> { BLOB | CLOB }
   [, <amount> INTEGER [, <offset_1> INTEGER [, <offset_2> INTEGER ]]])
```

## Parameters

`lob_1`

 Large object locator of the first large object to compare. Must be the same data type as `lob_2`.

`lob_2`

 Large object locator of the second large object to compare. Must be the same data type as `lob_1`.

`amount`

 If the data type of the large objects is `BLOB`, then the comparison is made for `amount` bytes. If the data type of the large objects is `CLOB`, then the comparison is made for `amount` characters. The default is the maximum size of a large object.

`offset_1`

 Position in the first large object to begin the comparison. The first byte/character is offset 1. The default is 1.

`offset_2`

 Position in the second large object to begin the comparison. The first byte/character is offset 1. The default is 1.

`status`

 Zero if both large objects are exactly the same for the specified length for the specified offsets. Nonzero if the objects aren't the same. `NULL` if `amount`, `offset_1`, or `offset_2` are less than zero.
