Use the `DROP_SCHEDULE` procedure to drop a schedule. The signature is:

```sql
DROP_SCHEDULE(
  <schedule_name> IN VARCHAR2,
  <force> IN BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE)
```

## Parameters

`schedule_name`

 `schedule_name` specifies the name of the schedule that's being dropped.

`force`

 `force` specifies the behavior of the server if the specified schedule is referenced by any job:

  -   Specify `FALSE` to return an error if the specified schedule is referenced by a job. This is the default behavior.
  -   Specify `TRUE` to disable to any jobs that use the specified schedule before dropping the schedule. Any running jobs are allowed to complete before the schedule is dropped.

## Example

The following call to `DROP_SCHEDULE` drops a schedule named `weeknights_at_5`:

```sql
DBMS_SCHEDULER.DROP_SCHEDULE('weeknights_at_5', TRUE);
```

The server disables any jobs that use the schedule before dropping the schedule.
