## Name

`DROP DIRECTORY` &mdash; Remove a directory alias for a file system directory path.

## Synopsis

```sql
DROP DIRECTORY <name>
```

## Description

`DROP DIRECTORY` drops an existing alias for a file system directory path that was created with the `CREATE DIRECTORY` command. To execute this command, you must be a superuser.

When you delete a directory alias, the corresponding physical file system directory isn't affected. To delete the file system directory, use operating system commands.

## Parameters

`name`

 The name of a directory alias to remove.

## Examples

Remove the directory alias `empdir`:

```sql
DROP DIRECTORY empdir;
```
