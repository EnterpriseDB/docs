<div id="alter_queue" class="registered_link"></div>

EDB Postgres Advanced Server includes an extra syntax not offered by Oracle with the `ALTER QUEUE SQL` command. You can use this syntax with the `DBMS_AQADM` package.

## Name

`ALTER QUEUE` &mdash; Allows a superuser or a user with the `aq_administrator_role` privilege to modify the attributes of a queue.

## Synopsis

This command is available in four forms. 

## Parameters for the first form

The first form of this command changes the name of a queue:

```sql
ALTER QUEUE <queue_name> RENAME TO <new_name>
```

`queue_name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing queue.

`RENAME TO`

 To rename the queue, include the `RENAME TO` clause and a new name for the queue.

`new_name`

 New name for the queue.


## Parameters for the second form

The second form of the `ALTER QUEUE` command modifies the attributes of the queue:

```sql
ALTER QUEUE <queue_name> SET [ ( { <option_name option_value> ) } [,SET <option_name> ] ]
```

`queue_name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing queue.

 Include the `SET` clause and `option_name/option_value` pairs to modify the attributes of the queue.

`option_name option_value`

 The name of an option to associate with the new queue and the corresponding value of the option. If you provide duplicate option names, the server returns an error.

-   If `option_name` is `retries`, provide an integer that represents the number of times to attempt a dequeue.
-   If `option_name` is `retrydelay`, provide a double-precision value that represents the delay in seconds.
-   If `option_name` is `retention`, provide a double-precision value that represents the retention time in seconds.

## Parameters for the third form

Use the third form of the `ALTER QUEUE` command to enable or disable enqueuing or dequeuing on a queue:

```sql
ALTER QUEUE <queue_name> ACCESS { START | STOP } [ FOR { enqueue | dequeue } ] [ NOWAIT ]
```

`queue_name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing queue.

`ACCESS`

 Include the `ACCESS` keyword to enable or disable enqueuing or dequeuing on a queue.

`START | STOP`

 Use the `START` and `STOP` keywords to indicate the desired state of the queue.

`FOR enqueue|dequeue`

 Use the `FOR` clause to indicate if you are specifying the state of enqueueing or dequeueing activity on the specified queue.

`NOWAIT`

 Include the `NOWAIT` keyword to specify for the server not to wait for the completion of outstanding transactions before changing the state of the queue. You can use the `NOWAIT` keyword only when specifying an `ACCESS` value of `STOP`. The server returns an error if `NOWAIT` is specified with an `ACCESS` value of `START`.

## Parameters for the fourth form

Use the fourth form to `ADD` or `DROP` callback details for a queue.

```sql
ALTER QUEUE <queue_name> { ADD | DROP } CALL TO <location_name> [ WITH <callback_option> ]
```

`queue_name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing queue.

`ADD | DROP`

 Include the `ADD` or `DROP` keywords to enable add or remove callback details for a queue.

`location_name`

 Specifies the name of the callback procedure.

`callback_option`

 Can be `context`. Specify a `RAW` value when including this clause.

## Examples

This example changes the name of a queue from `work_queue_east` to `work_order`:

```sql
ALTER QUEUE work_queue_east RENAME TO work_order;
```

This example modifies a queue named `work_order`. It sets the number of retries to 100, the delay between retries to 2 seconds, and the length of time that the queue retains dequeued messages to 10 seconds:

```sql
ALTER QUEUE work_order SET (retries 100, retrydelay 2, retention 10);
```

These commands enable enqueueing and dequeueing in a queue named `work_order`:

```sql
ALTER QUEUE work_order ACCESS START;
ALTER QUEUE work_order ACCESS START FOR enqueue;
ALTER QUEUE work_order ACCESS START FOR dequeue;
```

These commands disable enqueueing and dequeueing in a queue named `work_order`:

```sql
ALTER QUEUE work_order ACCESS STOP NOWAIT;
ALTER QUEUE work_order ACCESS STOP FOR enqueue;
ALTER QUEUE work_order ACCESS STOP FOR dequeue;
```
