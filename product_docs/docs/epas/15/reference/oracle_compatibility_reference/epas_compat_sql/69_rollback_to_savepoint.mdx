## Name

`ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` &mdash; Roll back to a savepoint.

## Synopsis

```sql
ROLLBACK [ WORK ] TO [ SAVEPOINT ] <savepoint_name>
```

## Description

Roll back all commands that were executed after the savepoint was set. The savepoint remains valid and you can roll back to it again if you need to.

`ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` destroys all savepoints that were established after the named savepoint.

## Parameters

`savepoint_name`

 The savepoint to which to roll back.

## Notes

Specifying a savepoint name that wasn't established is an error.

`ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT` isn't supported in SPL programs.

## Examples

Undo the effects of the commands executed from the point when savepoint `depts` was established:

```sql
\set AUTOCOMMIT off
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50, 'HR', 'NEW YORK');
SAVEPOINT depts;
INSERT INTO emp (empno, ename, deptno) VALUES (9001, 'JONES', 50);
INSERT INTO emp (empno, ename, deptno) VALUES (9002, 'ALICE', 50);
ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT depts;
```
