## Name

`CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` &mdash; Define a new materialized view.

## Synopsis

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW <name>
   [<build_clause>][<create_mv_refresh>] AS subquery

      Where <build_clause> is:

      BUILD {IMMEDIATE | DEFERRED}

      Where <create_mv_refresh> is:

      REFRESH [COMPLETE] [ON DEMAND]
```

## Description

`CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` defines a view of a query that isn't updated each time the view is referenced in a query. By default, the view is populated when the view is created. You can include the `BUILD DEFERRED` keywords to delay populating the view.

A materialized view can be schema-qualified. If you specify a schema name when invoking the `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` command, the view is created in the specified schema. The view name must be different from the name of any other view, table, sequence, or index in the same schema.

## Parameters

`name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a view to create.

`subquery`

 A `SELECT` statement that specifies the contents of the view.

`build_clause`

 Include a `build_clause` to specify when to populate the view. Specify `BUILD IMMEDIATE` or `BUILD DEFERRED`:

-   `BUILD IMMEDIATE` (the default) populates the view immediately. 
-   `BUILD DEFERRED` populates the view later, during a `REFRESH` operation.

`create_mv_refresh`

 Include the `create_mv_refresh` clause to specify when to update the contents of a materialized view. The clause contains the `REFRESH` keyword followed by optional `COMPLETE` and `ON DEMAND` keywords, where:

-   `COMPLETE` discards the current content and reloads the materialized view by executing the view's defining query when refreshing the materialized view.

-   `ON DEMAND` (the default) refreshes the materialized view on demand by calling the `DBMS_MVIEW` package or by calling the Postgres `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` statement.

## Notes

Materialized views are read-only. The server doesn't allow an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` on a view.

Permissions of the view owner determine access to tables referenced in the view. The user of a view must have permissions to call all functions the view uses.

For more information about the Postgres `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` command, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-refreshmaterializedview.html).

## Examples

This statement creates a materialized view named `dept_30`:

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW dept_30 BUILD IMMEDIATE AS SELECT * FROM emp WHERE deptno = 30;
```

The view contains information retrieved from the `emp` table about any employee that works in department `30`.
