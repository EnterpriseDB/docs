<div id="drop_queue_table" class="registered_link"></div>

EDB Postgres Advanced Server includes syntax not offered by Oracle with the `DROP QUEUE TABLE SQL` command. You can use this syntax with `DBMS_AQADM`.

## Name

`DROP QUEUE TABLE` &mdash; Drop a queue table.

## Synopsis

Use `DROP QUEUE TABLE` to delete a queue table:

```sql
DROP QUEUE TABLE [ IF EXISTS ] <name> [, ...]
[CASCADE | RESTRICT]
```

## Description

`DROP QUEUE TABLE` allows a superuser or a user with the `aq_administrator_role` privilege to delete a queue table.

## Parameters

`name`

 The name (possibly schema-qualified) of the queue table to delete.

`IF EXISTS`

 Include the `IF EXISTS` clause if you don't want to return an error if the queue table doesn't exist. Instead, issue a notice.

`CASCADE`

 Include the `CASCADE` keyword to delete objects that depend on the queue table.

`RESTRICT`

 Include the `RESTRICT` keyword to prevent deleting the queue table if any objects depend on it. This is the default.

## Examples

This example deletes a queue table named `work_order_table` and any objects that depend on it:

```sql
DROP QUEUE TABLE work_order_table CASCADE;
```
