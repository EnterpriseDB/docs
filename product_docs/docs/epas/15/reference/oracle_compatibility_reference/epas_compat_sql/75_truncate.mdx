## Name

`TRUNCATE` &mdash; Empty a table.

## Synopsis

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE <name> [DROP STORAGE]
```

## Description

`TRUNCATE` removes all rows from a table. It has the same effect as an unqualified `DELETE`. However, since it doesn't scan the table, it's faster. `TRUNCATE` is most useful on large tables.

The `DROP STORAGE` clause is accepted for compatibility but is ignored.

## Parameters

`name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of the table to truncate.

## Notes

You can't use `TRUNCATE` if there are foreign-key references to the table from other tables. Checking validity in such cases requires table scans, which `TRUNCATE` aims to avoid.

`TRUNCATE` doesn't run any user-defined `ON DELETE` triggers for the table.

## Examples

This command truncates a table named `accounts`:

```sql
TRUNCATE TABLE accounts;
```
