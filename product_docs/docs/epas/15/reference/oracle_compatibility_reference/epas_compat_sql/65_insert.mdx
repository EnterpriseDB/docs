## Name

`INSERT` &mdash; Create rows in a table.

## Synopsis

```sql
INSERT INTO <table>[@<dblink> | [ AS ] <alias> ] [ ( <column> [, ...] ) ]
  { VALUES ( { <expression> | DEFAULT } [, ...] )
    [ RETURNING <return_expression> [, ...]
        { INTO { <record> | <variable> [, ...] }
        | BULK COLLECT INTO <collection> [, ...] } ]
  | <query> }
```

## Description

`INSERT` allows you to insert new rows into a table. You can insert a single row or several rows as a result of a query.

You can list the columns in the target list in any order. Each column not present in the target list is inserted using a default value, either its declared default value or null.

If the expression for each column doesn't have the correct data type, type conversion is attempted.

You can specify the `RETURNING INTO { record | variable [, ...] }` clause only when the `INSERT` command is used in an SPL program and only when the `VALUES` clause is used.

You can specify the `RETURNING BULK COLLECT INTO collection [, ...]` clause only if the `INSERT` command is used in an SPL program. If you specify more than one `collection` as the target of the `BULK COLLECT INTO` clause, then each `collection` must consist of a single, scalar field. That is, `collection` can't be a record. The `return_expression` evaluated for each inserted row becomes an element in `collection`, starting with the first element. Any existing rows in `collection` are deleted. If the result set is empty, then `collection` is empty.

You need `INSERT` privilege to a table to insert into it. If you use the `query` clause to insert rows from a query, you also need `SELECT` privilege on any table used in the query.

## Parameters

`table`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing table.

`alias`

 A substitute name, which is an alias for the table, view, materialized view, or a subquery to reference in a statement during query execution.

`dblink`

 Database link name identifying a remote database. See [`CREATE DATABASE LINK`](21_create_public_database_link) for information on database links.

`column`

 The name of a column in `table`.

`expression`

 An expression or value to assign to `column`.

`DEFAULT`

 This column is filled with its default value.

`query`

 A query (`SELECT` statement) that supplies the rows to insert. See [`SELECT`](71_select) for a description of the syntax.

`return_expression`

 An expression that can include one or more columns from `table`. If you specify a column name from `table` in `return_expression`, the value substituted for the column when `return_expression` is evaluated is determined as follows:

  -   If the column specified in `return_expression` is assigned a value in the `INSERT` command, then the assigned value is used in the evaluation of `return_expression`.

  -   If the column specified in `return_expression` isn't assigned a value in the `INSERT` command, and there's no default value for the column in the table’s column definition, then null is used in the evaluation of `return_expression`.

  -   If the column specified in `return_expression` isn't assigned a value in the `INSERT` command, and there's a default value for the column in the table’s column definition, then the default value is used in the evaluation of `return_expression`.

`record`

 A record whose field to assign the evaluated `return_expression`. The first `return_expression` is assigned to the first field in `record`, the second `return_expression` is assigned to the second field in `record`, and so on. The number of fields in `record` must exactly match the number of expressions, and the fields must be type-compatible with their assigned expressions.

`variable`

 A variable to which to assign the evaluated `return_expression`. If you specify more than one `return_expression` and `variable`, the first `return_expression` is assigned to the first `variable`, the second `return_expression` is assigned to the second `variable`, and so on. The number of variables specified following the `INTO` keyword must exactly match the number of expressions following the `RETURNING` keyword. The variables must be type-compatible with their assigned expressions.

`collection`

 A collection in which an element is created from the evaluated `return_expression`. There can be either: 
 
 -  A single collection, which can be a collection of a single field or a collection of a record type. 
 -  More than one collection, in which case each collection must consist of a single field. 
 
 The number of return expressions must match in number and order the number of fields in all specified collections. Each corresponding `return_expression` and `collection` field must be type-compatible.

## Examples

Insert a single row into table `emp`:

```sql
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (8021,'JOHN','SALESMAN',7698,'22-FEB-07',1250,500,30);
```

This example omits the column `comm`, which means it uses the default value of null:

```sql
INSERT INTO emp (empno, ename, job, mgr, hiredate, sal, deptno)
    VALUES (8022,'PETERS','CLERK',7698,'03-DEC-06',950,30);
```

This example uses the `DEFAULT` clause for the `hiredate` and `comm` columns rather than specifying a value:

```sql
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (8023,'FORD','ANALYST',7566,NULL,3000,NULL,20);
```

This example creates a table for the department names and then inserts into the table by selecting from the `dname` column of the `dept` table:

```sql
CREATE TABLE deptnames (
    deptname        VARCHAR2(14)
);
INSERT INTO deptnames SELECT dname FROM dept;
```

This example creates an alias `enm` for the table `emp` and inserts rows into a table:

```sql
INSERT INTO emp AS enm (enm.empno, enm.ename, enm.job, enm.mgr, enm.hiredate, enm.sal, enm.deptno)
  VALUES (7499, 'SMITH', 'ANALYST', 7902, '03-DEC-06', 2500, 20);
```
