## Name

`ALTER TRIGGER` &mdash; Change the definition of a trigger.

## Synopsis

EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports three variations of the `ALTER TRIGGER` command. Use the first variation to change the name of a given trigger without changing the trigger definition:

```sql
ALTER TRIGGER <name> ON <table_name> RENAME TO <new_name>
```

Use the second variation of the `ALTER TRIGGER` command if the trigger depends on an extension. If the extension is dropped, the trigger is dropped as well.

```sql
ALTER TRIGGER <name> ON <table_name> DEPENDS ON EXTENSION <extension_name>
```

Use the third variation of the `ALTER TRIGGER` command to change the ownership of a trigger's object:

```sql
ALTER TRIGGER <name> ON <table_name> AUTHORIZATION <rolespec>
```

For information about using non-compatible implementations of the `ALTER TRIGGER` command that are supported by EDB Postgres Advanced Server, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertrigger.html).

## Description

`ALTER TRIGGER` changes the properties of an existing trigger. You must own the table the trigger acts on to change its properties.

To alter an owner of the trigger's implicit object, you can use the `ALTER TRIGGER ...ON AUTHORIZATION` command. You must have the privilege to execute `ALTER TRIGGER ...ON AUTHORIZATION` command to assign the trigger's implicit object ownership to a user after authorization.

## Parameters

`name`

 The name of the trigger to alter.

`table_name`

 The name of a table on which trigger acts.

`rolespec`

 Determines an owner of trigger objects.

## Examples

This example includes the users `bob` and `carol` as superusers. The user `bob` owns a table `emp`. The user `carol` owns a trigger named `emp_sal_trig`, which is created on table `emp`:

```sql
SELECT relname, relowner::regrole FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'emp';
__OUTPUT__
 relname | relowner
---------+----------
 emp     | bob
(1 row)
```

```sql
SELECT proname, proowner::regrole FROM pg_proc WHERE oid = (SELECT tgfoid
FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'emp_sal_trig') ORDER BY oid;
__OUTPUT__
 proname           | proowner
-------------------+----------
 emp_sal_trig_emp  | carol
(1 row)
```

To alter the ownership of table `emp` from user `bob` to a new owner `edb`:

```sql
ALTER TABLE emp OWNER TO edb;
ALTER TABLE

SELECT relname, relowner::regrole FROM pg_class WHERE relname = 'emp';
__OUTPUT__
 relname | relowner
---------+----------
 emp     | edb
(1 row)
```

The table ownership is changed from the user `bob` to an owner `edb`, but the trigger ownership of `emp_sal_trig` isn't altered and is owned by user `carol`. Alter the trigger `emp_sal_trig` on table `emp`, and grant authorization to an owner `edb`:

```sql
ALTER TRIGGER emp_sal_trig ON emp AUTHORIZATION edb;
ALTER TRIGGER

SELECT proname, proowner::regrole FROM pg_proc WHERE oid = (SELECT tgfoid
FROM pg_trigger WHERE tgname = 'emp_sal_trig') ORDER BY oid;
__OUTPUT__
 proname          | proowner
------------------+----------
 emp_sal_trig_emp | edb
(1 row)
```

The trigger ownership `emp_sal_trig` on table `emp` is altered and granted to an owner `edb`.
