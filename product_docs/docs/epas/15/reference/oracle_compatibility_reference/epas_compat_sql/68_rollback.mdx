## Name

`ROLLBACK` &mdash; Abort the current transaction.

## Synopsis

```sql
ROLLBACK [ WORK ]
```

## Description

`ROLLBACK` rolls back the current transaction and discards all the updates made by the transaction.

## Parameters

`WORK`

 Optional keyword that has no effect.

## Notes

Use `COMMIT` to successfully terminate a transaction.

Issuing `ROLLBACK` when not inside a transaction does no harm.

!!! Note
    Executing a `ROLLBACK` in a plpgsql procedure throws an error if there's an Oracle-style SPL procedure on the runtime stack.

## Examples

Abort all changes:

```sql
ROLLBACK;
```
