## Name

`ALTER DIRECTORY` &mdash; Change the owner of a directory created using the [CREATE DIRECTORY](22_create_directory/#create_directory) command.

## Synopsis

```sql
ALTER DIRECTORY <name> OWNER TO <rolename>
```

## Description

The `ALTER DIRECTORY ...OWNER TO` command changes the owner of a directory. You must have the superuser privilege to execute this command. The new owner of the directory must also have the superuser privilege.

## Parameters

`name`

 The name of the directory to alter.

`rolename`

 The name of an owner of the directory.

## Examples

These examples change ownership. `bob` and `carol` are superusers. `bob` is a current owner of the directory `EMPDIR`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM all_directories where directory_name = 'EMPDIR' order
by 1,2,3;
__OUTPUT__
 owner | directory_name | directory_path
-------+----------------+----------------
 bob   | EMPDIR         | /path
(1 row)
```

To change the ownership of directory `EMPDIR` to `carol`:

```sql
ALTER DIRECTORY EMPDIR OWNER TO carol;
ALTER DIRECTORY

SELECT * FROM all_directories where directory_name = 'EMPDIR' order by
1,2,3;
__OUTPUT__
 owner | directory_name | directory_path
-------+----------------+----------------
 carol | EMPDIR         | /path
(1 row)
```
