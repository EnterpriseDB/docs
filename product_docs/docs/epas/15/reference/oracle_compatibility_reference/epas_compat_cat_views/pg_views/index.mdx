System catalog views are present in PostgreSQL. They may have extra information when accessed in EDB Postgres Advanced Server. The [`PG_USER`](pg_user) view is an example of a system catalog view that provides additional information specific to EDB Postgres Advanced Server.         

For the complete list of the System Catalogs see [PostgreSQL System Catalogs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalogs.html).
