Catalog views provide information about database objects. There are two catagories of catalog views:

- Oracle catalog views provide information about database objects in a manner compatible with the Oracle data dictionary views.

- System catalog views are present in PostgreSQL and may have extra information when accessed in EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

The topics in this section describe the features related to the catalog views support provided by EDB Postgres Advanced Server.
