Catalog views provide information about database objects. There are two catagories of catalog views:

- Oracle catalog views provide information about database objects in a manner compatible with the Oracle data dictionary views.

- System catalog views are present in PostgreSQL and may have extra information when accessed in EDB Postgres Advanced Server.
