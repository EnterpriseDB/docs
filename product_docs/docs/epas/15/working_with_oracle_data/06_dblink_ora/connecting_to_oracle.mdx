To enable Oracle connectivity, download Oracle's freely available OCI drivers from [their website](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/database-technologies/instant-client/overview/index.html).

## Creating a symbolic link 

For Linux, if the Oracle instant client that you downloaded doesn't include the `libclntsh.so` library, you must create a symbolic link named `libclntsh.so` that points to the downloaded version. Navigate to the instant client directory and execute the following command:

```shell
ln -s libclntsh.so.<version> libclntsh.so
```

Where `version` is the version number of the `libclntsh.so` library. For example:

```shell
ln -s libclntsh.so.12.1 libclntsh.so
```
## Setting the environment variable

Before creating a link to an Oracle server, you must direct EDB Postgres Advanced Server to the correct Oracle home directory. Set the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable on Linux or `PATH` on Windows to the `lib` directory of the Oracle client installation directory.

## Setting the oracle_home configuration parameter

Alternatively, you can set the value of the `oracle_home` configuration parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file. The value specified in the `oracle_home` configuration parameter overrides the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` environment variable in Linux and `PATH` environment variable in Windows.

!!! Note
    The `oracle_home` configuration parameter provides the correct path to the Oracle client, that is, the `OCI` library.

To set the `oracle_home` configuration parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file, edit the file and add the following line:

```ini
oracle_home = 'lib_directory'
```

In place of `<lib_directory>`, substitute the name of the `oracle_home` path to the Oracle client installation directory that contains `libclntsh.so` in Linux and `oci.dll` in Windows.

## Restarting the server

After setting the `oracle_home` configuration parameter, you must restart the server for the changes to take effect. Restart the server:

-   On Linux, using the `systemctl` command or `pg_ctl` services.

-   On Windows, from the Windows Services console.
