<div id="using_embedded_sql" class="registered_link"></div>

These two examples show how to use embedded SQL with EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

## Example: A simple query

The first code sample shows how to execute a `SELECT` statement that returns a single row, storing the results in a group of host variables. After declaring host variables, it connects to the `edb` sample database using a hard-coded role name and the associated password and queries the `emp` table. The query returns the values into the declared host variables. After checking the value of the `NULL` indicator variable, it prints a simple result set onscreen and closes the connection.

```c
/************************************************************
 * print_emp.pgc
 *
 */
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
  EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
    int v_empno;
    char v_ename[40];
    double v_sal;
    double v_comm;
    short v_comm_ind;
  EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

  EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR sqlprint;

  EXEC SQL CONNECT TO edb
    USER 'alice' IDENTIFIED BY '1safepwd';

  EXEC SQL
     SELECT
      empno, ename, sal, comm
     INTO
      :v_empno, :v_ename, :v_sal, :v_comm INDICATOR:v_comm_ind
     FROM
      emp
    WHERE
      empno = 7369;

  if (v_comm_ind)
    printf("empno(%d), ename(%s), sal(%.2f) comm(NULL)\n",
            v_empno, v_ename, v_sal);
  else
    printf("empno(%d), ename(%s), sal(%.2f) comm(%.2f)\n",
            v_empno, v_ename, v_sal, v_comm);
  EXEC SQL DISCONNECT;
}
/***********************************************************\*
```

The code sample begins by including the prototypes and type definitions for the C `stdio` library and then declares the `main` function:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
```

Next, the application declares a set of host variables used to interact with the database server:

```c
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
  int v_empno;
  char v_ename[40];
  double v_sal;
  double v_comm;
  short v_comm_ind;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;
```

If you plan to precompile the code in `PROC` mode, you can omit the `BEGIN DECLAREâ€¦END DECLARE` section. For more information about declaring host variables, see [Declaring host variables](#declaring-host-variables).

The data type associated with each variable in the declaration section is a C data type. Data passed between the server and the client application must share a compatible data type. For more information about data types, see the [Supported C data types](/epas/latest/reference/application_programmer_reference/07_reference/).

The next statement tells the server how to handle an error:

```sql
EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR sqlprint;
```

If the client application encounters an error in the SQL code, the server prints an error message to `stderr` (standard error), using the `sqlprint()` function supplied with `ecpglib`. The next `EXEC SQL` statement establishes a connection with EDB Postgres Advanced Server:

```sql
EXEC SQL CONNECT TO edb
  USER 'alice' IDENTIFIED BY '1safepwd';
```

In this example, the client application connects to the `edb` database using a role named alice with a password of `1safepwd`.

The code then performs a query against the `emp` table:

```sql
EXEC SQL
   SELECT
     empno, ename, sal, comm
   INTO
     :v_empno, :v_ename, :v_sal, :v_comm INDICATOR :v_comm_ind
   FROM
     emp
  WHERE
     empno = 7369;
```

The query returns information about employee number 7369.

The `SELECT` statement uses an `INTO` clause to assign the retrieved values (from the `empno`, `ename`, `sal`, and `comm` columns) into the `:v_empno`, `:v_ename`, `:v_sal`, and `:v_comm` host variables (and the `:v_comm_ind` null indicator). The first value retrieved is assigned to the first variable listed in the `INTO` clause, the second value is assigned to the second variable, and so on.

The `comm` column contains the commission values earned by an employee and can potentially contain a `NULL` value. The statement includes the `INDICATOR` keyword and a host variable to hold a null indicator.

The code checks the null indicator and displays the appropriate results:

```C
if (v_comm_ind)
  printf("empno(%d), ename(%s), sal(%.2f) comm(NULL)\n",
          v_empno, v_ename, v_sal);
else
  printf("empno(%d), ename(%s), sal(%.2f) comm(%.2f)\n",
          v_empno, v_ename, v_sal, v_comm);
```

If the null indicator is `0` (that is, `false`), the `comm` column contains a meaningful value, and the `printf` function displays the commission. If the null indicator contains a non-zero value, `comm` is `NULL`, and `printf` displays a value of `NULL`. A host variable (other than a null indicator) contains no meaningful value if you fetch a `NULL` into that host variable. You must use null indicators to identify any value that might be `NULL`.

The final statement in the code sample closes the connection to the server:

```sql
EXEC SQL DISCONNECT;
}
```

### Using indicator variables

The previous example included an *indicator variable* that identifies any row in which the value of the `comm` column (when returned by the server) was `NULL`. An indicator variable is an extra host variable that denotes if the content of the preceding variable is `NULL` or truncated. The indicator variable is populated when the contents of a row are stored. An indicator variable can contain the following values:

| Indicator value                               | Denotes                                                                          |
| --------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| If an indicator variable is less than `0`.    | The value returned by the server was `NULL`.                                     |
| If an indicator variable is equal to `0`.     | The value returned by the server was not `NULL`, and was not truncated.          |
| If an indicator variable is greater than `0`. | The value returned by the server was truncated when stored in the host variable. |

When including an indicator variable in an `INTO` clause, you don't need to include the optional `INDICATOR` keyword.

You can omit an indicator variable if you're certain that a query never returns a `NULL` value into the corresponding host variable. If you omit an indicator variable and a query returns a `NULL` value, `ecpglib` raises a runtime error.

### Declaring host variables

You can use a *host variable* in a SQL statement at any point that a value can appear in that statement. A host variable is a C variable that you can use to pass data values from the client application to the server and return data from the server to the client application. A host variable can be:

-   An array
-   A `typedef`
-   A pointer
-   A `struct`
-   Any scalar C data type

The code fragments that follow show using host variables in code compiled in `PROC` mode and in non-`PROC` mode. The SQL statement adds a row to the `dept` table, inserting the values returned by the variables `v_deptno`, `v_dname`, and `v_loc` into the `deptno` column, the `dname` column, and the `loc` column, respectively.

If you're compiling in `PROC` mode, you can omit the `EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION` and `EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION` directives. `PROC` mode permits you to use C function parameters as host variables:

```c
void addDept(int v_deptno, char v_dname, char v_loc)
{
  EXEC SQL INSERT INTO dept VALUES( :v_deptno, :v_dname, :v_loc);
}
```

If you aren't compiling in `PROC` mode, you must wrap embedded variable declarations with the `EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION` and the `EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION` directives:

```c
void addDept(int v_deptno, char v_dname, char v_loc)
{
  EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
    int v_deptno_copy = v_deptno;
    char v_dname_copy[14+1] = v_dname;
    char v_loc_copy[13+1] = v_loc;
  EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

  EXEC SQL INSERT INTO dept VALUES( :v_deptno, :v_dname, :v_loc);
}
```

You can also include the `INTO` clause in a `SELECT` statement to use the host variables to retrieve information:

```sql
EXEC SQL SELECT deptno, dname, loc
  INTO :v_deptno, :v_dname, v_loc FROM dept;
```

Each column returned by the `SELECT` statement must have a type-compatible target variable in the `INTO` clause. This is a simple example that retrieves a single row. To retrieve more than one row, you must define a cursor, as shown in the next example.

## Example: Using a cursor to process a result set

The code sample that follows shows using a cursor to process a result set. Four basic steps are involved in creating and using a cursor:

1.  Use the `DECLARE CURSOR` statement to define a cursor.
2.  Use the `OPEN CURSOR` statement to open the cursor.
3.  Use the `FETCH` statement to retrieve data from a cursor.
4.  Use the `CLOSE CURSOR` statement to close the cursor.

After declaring host variables, the example connects to the `edb` database using a user-supplied role name and password and queries the `emp` table. The query returns the values into a cursor named `employees`. The code sample then opens the cursor and loops through the result set a row at a time, printing the result set. When the sample detects the end of the result set, it closes the connection.

```c
/************************************************************
 * print_emps.pgc
 *
 */
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
    char *username = argv[1];
    char *password = argv[2];
    int v_empno;
    char v_ename[40];
    double v_sal;
    double v_comm;
    short v_comm_ind;
  EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;

  EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR sqlprint;

  EXEC SQL CONNECT TO edb USER :username IDENTIFIED BY :password;

  EXEC SQL DECLARE employees CURSOR FOR
    SELECT
      empno, ename, sal, commÂ 
    FROMÂ 
      emp;

  EXEC SQL OPEN employees;

  EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND DO break;

  for (;;)
  {
    EXEC SQL FETCH NEXT FROM employeesÂ 
      INTO
       :v_empno, :v_ename, :v_sal, :v_comm INDICATOR :v_comm_ind;

    if (v_comm_ind)
      printf("empno(%d), ename(%s), sal(%.2f) comm(NULL)\n",
              v_empno, v_ename, v_sal);
    else
      printf("empno(%d), ename(%s), sal(%.2f) comm(%.2f)\n",
              v_empno, v_ename, v_sal, v_comm);
  }
  EXEC SQL CLOSE employees;
  EXEC SQL DISCONNECT;
}
/************************************************************
```

The code sample begins by including the prototypes and type definitions for the C `stdio` library and then declares the `main` function:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
```

Next, the application declares a set of host variables used to interact with the database server:

```sql
EXEC SQL BEGIN DECLARE SECTION;
  char *username = argv[1];
  char *password = argv[2];
  int v_empno;
  char v_ename[40];
  double v_sal;
  double v_comm;
  short v_comm_ind;
EXEC SQL END DECLARE SECTION;
```

`argv[]` is an array that contains the command line arguments entered when the user runs the client application. `argv[1]` contains the first command line argument (in this case, a `username`), and `argv[2]` contains the second command line argument (a `password`). The example omits the error-checking code you would normally include a real-world application. The declaration initializes the values of `username` and `password`, setting them to the values entered when the user invoked the client application.

You might think that you can refer to `argv[1]` and `argv[2]` in a SQL statement instead of creating a separate copy of each variable. However, that doesn't work. All host variables must be declared in a `BEGIN/END DECLARE SECTION`, unless you're compiling in `PROC` mode. Since `argv` is a function *parameter* (not an automatic variable), you can't declare it in a `BEGIN/END DECLARE SECTION`. If you're compiling in `PROC` mode, you can refer to any C variable in a SQL statement.

The next statement tells the server to respond to an SQL error by printing the text of the error message returned by ECPGPlus or the database server:

```sql
EXEC SQL WHENEVER SQLERROR sqlprint;
```

Then, the client application establishes a connection with EDB Postgres Advanced Server:

```sql
EXEC SQL CONNECT TO edb USER :username IDENTIFIED BY :password;
```

The `CONNECT` statement creates a connection to the `edb` database, using the values found in the `:username` and `:password` host variables to authenticate the application to the server when connecting.

The next statement declares a cursor named `employees`:

```sql
EXEC SQL DECLARE employees CURSOR FOR
  SELECT
    empno, ename, sal, commÂ 
  FROMÂ 
    emp;
```

`employees` contains the result set of a `SELECT` statement on the `emp` table. The query returns employee information from the following columns: `empno`, `ename`, `sal`, and `comm`. Notice that when you declare a cursor, you don't include an `INTO` clause. Instead, you specify the target variables (or descriptors) when you `FETCH` from the cursor.

Before fetching rows from the cursor, the client application must `OPEN` the cursor:

```sql
EXEC SQL OPEN employees;
```

In the subsequent `FETCH` section, the client application loops through the contents of the cursor. The client application includes a `WHENEVER` statement that instructs the server to `break` (that is, terminate the loop) when it reaches the end of the cursor:

```sql
EXEC SQL WHENEVER NOT FOUND DO break;
```

The client application then uses a `FETCH` statement to retrieve each row from the cursor `INTO` the previously declared host variables:

```c
for (;;)
{
  EXEC SQL FETCH NEXT FROM employees
    INTO
     :v_empno, :v_ename, :v_sal, :v_comm INDICATOR :v_comm_ind;
```

The `FETCH` statement uses an `INTO` clause to assign the retrieved values into the `:v_empno`, `:v_ename`, `:v_sal`, and `:v_comm` host variables (and the `:v_comm_ind` null indicator). The first value in the cursor is assigned to the first variable listed in the `INTO` clause, the second value is assigned to the second variable, and so on.

The `FETCH` statement also includes the `INDICATOR` keyword and a host variable to hold a null indicator. If the `comm` column for the retrieved record contains a `NULL` value, `v_comm_ind` is set to a non-zero value, indicating that the column is `NULL`.

The code then checks the null indicator and displays the appropriate results:

```c
if (v_comm_ind)
  printf("empno(%d), ename(%s), sal(%.2f) comm(NULL)\n",
          v_empno, v_ename, v_sal);
else
  printf("empno(%d), ename(%s), sal(%.2f) comm(%.2f)\n",
          v_empno, v_ename, v_sal, v_comm);
}
```

If the null indicator is `0` (that is, `false`), `v_comm` contains a meaningful value, and the `printf` function displays the commission. If the null indicator contains a non-zero value, `comm` is `NULL`, and `printf` displays the string `'NULL'`. A host variable (other than a null indicator) contains no meaningful value if you fetch a `NULL` into that host variable. You must use null indicators for any value which may be `NULL`.

The final statements in the code sample close the cursor `(employees)` and the connection to the server:

```sql
EXEC SQL CLOSE employees;
EXEC SQL DISCONNECT;
```
