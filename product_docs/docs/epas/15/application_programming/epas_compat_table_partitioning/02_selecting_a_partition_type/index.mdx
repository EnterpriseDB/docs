When you create a partitioned table, you specify `LIST`, `RANGE`, or `HASH` partitioning rules. The partitioning rules provide a set of constraints that define the data that's stored in each partition. As you add rows to the partitioned table, the server uses the partitioning rules to decide which partition contains each row.

EDB Postgres Advanced Server can also use the partitioning rules to enforce partition pruning, which improves performance when responding to user queries. When selecting a partitioning type and partitioning keys for a table, consider how the data that's stored in a table is queried, and include often-queried columns in the partitioning rules.

## List partitioning

When you create a list-partitioned table, you specify a single partitioning key column. When adding a row to the table, the server compares the key values specified in the partitioning rule to the corresponding column in the row. If the column value matches a value in the partitioning rule, the row is stored in the partition named in the rule.

!!! Note
    List partitioning doesn't support multi-column list partitioning.

## Range partitioning

When you create a range-partitioned table, you specify one or more partitioning key columns. When you add a row to the table, the server compares the value of the partitioning keys to the corresponding columns in a table entry. If the column values satisfy the conditions specified in the partitioning rule, the row is stored in the partition named in the rule.

## Hash partitioning

When you create a hash-partitioned table, you specify one or more partitioning key columns. Data is divided into approximately equal-sized partitions among the specified partitions. When you add a row to a hash-partitioned table, the server computes a hash value for the data in the specified columns and stores the row in a partition according to the hash value.

!!! Note
    When upgrading EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you must rebuild each hash-partitioned table on the upgraded version server.

## Subpartitioning

Subpartitioning breaks a partitioned table into smaller subsets. You must store all subsets in the same database server cluster. A table is typically subpartitioned by a different set of columns. It can have a different subpartitioning type from the parent partition. If you subpartition one partition, then each partition has at least one subpartition.

If you subpartition a table, no data is stored in any of the partition tables. Instead, the data is stored in the corresponding subpartitions.
