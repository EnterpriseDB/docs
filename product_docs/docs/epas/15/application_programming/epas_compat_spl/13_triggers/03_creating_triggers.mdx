The `CREATE TRIGGER` command defines and names a trigger that's stored in the database.

## Name

`CREATE TRIGGER` &mdash; Define a simple trigger.

## Synopsis

```sql
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] TRIGGER <name>
  { BEFORE | AFTER | INSTEAD OF }
  { INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE | TRUNCATE }
      [ OR { INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE | TRUNCATE } ] [, ...]
    ON <table>
  [ REFERENCING { OLD AS <old> | NEW AS <new> } ...]
  [ FOR EACH ROW ]
  [ WHEN <condition> ]
  [ DECLARE
      [ PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION; ]
      <declaration>; [, ...] ]
    BEGIN
      <statement>; [, ...]
  [ EXCEPTION
    { WHEN <exception> [ OR <exception> ] [...] THEN
        <statement>; [, ...] } [, ...]
  ]
    END
```

## Name

`CREATE TRIGGER` &mdash; Define a compound trigger.

## Synopsis

```sql
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] TRIGGER <name>
  FOR { INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE | TRUNCATE }
        [ OR { INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE | TRUNCATE } ] [, ...]
           ON <table>
       [ REFERENCING { OLD AS <old> | NEW AS <new>. } ...]
       [ WHEN <condition> ]
       COMPOUND TRIGGER
       [ <private_declaration>; ] ...
       [ <procedure_or_function_definition> ] ...
       <compound_trigger_definition>
         END
```

Where `private_declaration` is an identifier of a private variable that can be accessed by any procedure or function. There can be zero, one, or more private variables. `private_declaration` can be any of the following:

-   Variable declaration
-   Record declaration
-   Collection declaration
-   `REF CURSOR` and cursor variable declaration
-   `TYPE` definitions for records, collections, and `REF CURSOR`
-   Exception
-   Object variable declaration

Where `procedure_or_function_definition :=`

`procedure_definition | function_definition`

Where `procedure_definition :=`

```sql
PROCEDURE proc_name[ argument_list ]
  [ options_list ]
  { IS | AS }
    procedure_body
  END [ proc_name ] ;
```

Where `procedure_body :=`

```sql
[ <declaration>; ] [, ...]
BEGIN
  <statement>; [...]
[ EXCEPTION
   { WHEN <exception> [OR <exception>] [...]] THEN <statement>; }
   [...]
]
```

Where `function_definition :=`

```sql
FUNCTION func_name [ argument_list ]
  RETURN rettype [ DETERMINISTIC ]
  [ options_list ]
  { IS | AS }
    function_body
  END [ func_name ] ;
```

Where `function_body :=`

```sql
[ <declaration>; ] [, ...]
BEGIN
  <statement>; [...]
[ EXCEPTION
  { WHEN <exception> [ OR <exception> ] [...] THEN <statement>; }
  [...]
]
```

Where `compound_trigger_definition` is:

```sql
{ compound_trigger_event } { IS | AS }
  compound_trigger_body
END [ compound_trigger_event ] [ ... ]
```

Where `compound_trigger_event:=`

```sql
[ BEFORE STATEMENT | BEFORE EACH ROW | AFTER EACH ROW | AFTER STATEMENT  | INSTEAD OF EACH ROW ]
```

Where `compound_trigger_body:=`

```sql
[ <declaration>; ] [, ...]
BEGIN
  <statement>; [...]
[ EXCEPTION
   { WHEN <exception> [OR <exception>] [...] THEN <statement>; }
   [...]
]
```

## Description

`CREATE TRIGGER` defines a new trigger. `CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER` creates a new trigger or replaces an existing definition.

If you're using the `CREATE TRIGGER` keywords to create a trigger, the name of the new trigger must not match any existing trigger defined on the same table. New triggers are created in the same schema as the table on which the triggering event is defined.

If you're updating the definition of an existing trigger, use the `CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER` keywords.

When you use syntax compatible with Oracle databases to create a trigger, the trigger runs as a `SECURITY DEFINER` function.

## Parameters

`name`

 The name of the trigger to create.

`BEFORE | AFTER`

 Determines whether the trigger is fired before or after the triggering event.

`INSTEAD OF`

 Trigger that modifies an updatable view. The trigger executes to update the underlying tables appropriately. The `INSTEAD OF` trigger executes for each row of the view that's updated or modified.

`INSERT | UPDATE | DELETE | TRUNCATE`

 Defines the triggering event.

`table`

 The name of the table or view on which the triggering event occurs.

`condition`

 A Boolean expression that determines if the trigger actually executes. If `condition` evaluates to `TRUE`, the trigger fires.

-   If the simple trigger definition includes the `FOR EACH ROW` keywords, the `WHEN` clause can refer to columns of the old or new row values by writing `OLD.column_name` or `NEW.column_name` respectively. `INSERT` triggers can't refer to `OLD`, and `DELETE` triggers can't refer to `NEW`.

-   If the compound trigger definition includes a statement-level trigger having a `WHEN` clause, then the trigger executes without evaluating the expression in the `WHEN` clause. Similarly, if a compound trigger definition includes a row-level trigger having a `WHEN` clause, then the trigger executes if the expression evaluates to `TRUE`.

-   If the trigger includes the `INSTEAD OF` keywords, it can't include a `WHEN` clause. A `WHEN` clause can't contain subqueries.

`REFERENCING { OLD AS old | NEW AS new } ...`

 `REFERENCING` clause to reference old rows and new rows but restricted in that `old` can be replaced only by an identifier named `old` or any equivalent that's saved in all lowercase. Examples include `REFERENCING OLD AS old`, `REFERENCING OLD AS OLD`, or `REFERENCING OLD AS "old"`. Also, `new` can be replaced only by an identifier named `new` or any equivalent that's saved in all lowercase. Examples include `REFERENCING NEW AS new`, `REFERENCING NEW AS NEW`, or `REFERENCING NEW AS "new"`.

 You can specify one or both phrases `OLD AS old` and `NEW AS new` in the `REFERENCING` clause, such as `REFERENCING NEW AS New OLD AS Old`. This clause isn't compatible with Oracle databases in that you can't use identifiers other than `old` or `new`.

`FOR EACH ROW`

 Determines whether to fire the trigger once for every row affected by the triggering event or once per SQL statement. If specified, the trigger is fired once for every affected row (row-level trigger). Otherwise the trigger is a statement-level trigger.

`PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION`

 `PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` is the directive that sets the trigger as an autonomous transaction.

`declaration`

 A variable, type, `REF CURSOR`, or subprogram declaration. If subprogram declarations are included, you must declare them after all other variable, type, and `REF CURSOR` declarations.

`statement`

 An SPL program statement. A `DECLARE - BEGIN - END` block is considered an SPL statement. Thus, the trigger body can contain nested blocks.

`exception`

 An exception condition name such as `NO_DATA_FOUND`.
