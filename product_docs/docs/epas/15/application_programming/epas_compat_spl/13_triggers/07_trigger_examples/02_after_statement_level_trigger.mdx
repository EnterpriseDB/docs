<div id="after_statement_level_trigger" class="registered_link"></div>

This example shows an after statement-level trigger. When an insert, update, or delete operation occurs on the `emp` table, a row is added to the `empauditlog` table recording the date, user, and action.

```sql
CREATE TABLE empauditlog (
    audit_date      DATE,
    audit_user      VARCHAR2(20),
    audit_desc      VARCHAR2(20)
);
CREATE OR REPLACE TRIGGER emp_audit_trig
    AFTER INSERT OR UPDATE OR DELETE ON emp
DECLARE
    v_action        VARCHAR2(20);
BEGIN
    IF INSERTING THEN
        v_action := 'Added employee(s)';
    ELSIF UPDATING THEN
        v_action := 'Updated employee(s)';
    ELSIF DELETING THEN
        v_action := 'Deleted employee(s)';
    END IF;
    INSERT INTO empauditlog VALUES (SYSDATE, USER,
        v_action);
END;
```

In the following sequence of commands, two rows are inserted into the `emp` table using two `INSERT` commands. One `UPDATE` command updates the `sal` and `comm` columns of both rows. Then, one `DELETE` command deletes both rows.

```sql
INSERT INTO emp VALUES (9001,'SMITH','ANALYST',7782,SYSDATE,NULL,NULL,10);

INSERT INTO emp VALUES (9002,'JONES','CLERK',7782,SYSDATE,NULL,NULL,10);

UPDATE emp SET sal = 4000.00, comm = 1200.00 WHERE empno IN (9001, 9002);

DELETE FROM emp WHERE empno IN (9001, 9002);

SELECT TO_CHAR(AUDIT_DATE,'DD-MON-YY HH24:MI:SS') AS "AUDIT DATE",
    audit_user, audit_desc FROM empauditlog ORDER BY 1 ASC;
__OUTPUT__
AUDIT DATE         AUDIT_USER           AUDIT_DESC
------------------ -------------------- --------------------
31-MAR-05 14:59:48 SYSTEM               Added employee(s)
31-MAR-05 15:00:07 SYSTEM               Added employee(s)
31-MAR-05 15:00:19 SYSTEM               Updated employee(s)
31-MAR-05 15:00:34 SYSTEM               Deleted employee(s)
```

The contents of the `empauditlog` table show how many times the trigger was fired: 

-  Once each for the two inserts
-  Once for the update (even though two rows were changed)
-  Once for the deletion (even though two rows were deleted)
