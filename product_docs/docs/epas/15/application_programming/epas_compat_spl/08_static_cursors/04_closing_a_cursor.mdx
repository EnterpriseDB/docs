Once all the desired rows are retrieved from the cursor result set, close the cursor. After you close the cursor, you can no longer access the result set. 

The `CLOSE` statement appears as follows:

```sql
CLOSE <name>;
```

`name` is the identifier of a cursor that's currently open. After you close a cursor, don't close it again. However, after you close the cursor, you can use the `OPEN` statement again on the closed cursor and rebuild the query result set. After that, the `FETCH` statement can then retrieve the rows of the new result set.

This example uses the `CLOSE` statement:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    v_emp_rec       emp%ROWTYPE;
    CURSOR emp_cur_1 IS SELECT * FROM emp;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_1;
    FETCH emp_cur_1 INTO v_emp_rec;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee Number: ' || v_emp_rec.empno);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee Name  : ' || v_emp_rec.ename);
    CLOSE emp_cur_1;
END;
```

This procedure produces the following output. Employee number `7369, SMITH` is the first row of the result set.

```sql
EXEC cursor_example;
__OUTPUT__
Employee Number: 7369
Employee Name  : SMITH
```
