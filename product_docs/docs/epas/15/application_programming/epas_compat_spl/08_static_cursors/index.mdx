<div id="static_cursors" class="registered_link"></div>

Rather than executing a whole query at once, you can set up a *cursor* that encapsulates the query and then read the query result set one row at a time. This approach allows you to create SPL program logic that retrieves a row from the result set, does some processing on the data in that row, and then retrieves the next row and repeats the process.

Cursors are most often used in the context of a `FOR` or `WHILE` loop. Include a conditional test in the SPL logic that detects when the end of the result set was reached so the program can exit the loop.
