<div id="object_type_body_syntax" class="registered_link"></div>

The following is the syntax of the object type body:

```sql
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] TYPE BODY <name>
  { IS | AS }
  <method_spec> [...]
  [<constructor>] [...]
END;
```

Where `method_spec` is `subprogram_spec`, and `subprogram_spec` is the following:

```sql
{ MEMBER | STATIC }
{ PROCEDURE <proc_name>
    [ ( [  SELF [ IN | IN OUT ] <name> ]
        [, <parm1> [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] <datatype1>
                 [ DEFAULT <value1> ] ]
        [, <parm2> [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] <datatype2>
                 [ DEFAULT <value2> ]
        ] ...)
    ]
{ IS | AS }
  [ PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION; ]
  [ <declarations> ]
  BEGIN
    <statement>; ...
[ EXCEPTION
    WHEN ... THEN
      <statement>; ...]
  END;
|
  FUNCTION <func_name>
    [ ( [  SELF [ IN | IN OUT ] <name> ]
        [, <parm1> [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] <datatype1>
                 [ DEFAULT <value1> ] ]
        [, <parm2> [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] <datatype2>
                 [ DEFAULT <value2> ]
        ] ...)
    ]
  RETURN <return_type>
{ IS | AS }
  [ PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION; ]
  [ <declarations> ]
  BEGIN
    <statement>; ...
[ EXCEPTION
    WHEN ... THEN
      <statement>; ...]
  END;
```

Where `constructor` is:

```sql
CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION <func_name>
  [ ( [ <parm1> [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] <datatype1>
               [ DEFAULT <value1> ] ]
      [, <parm2> [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] <datatype2>
               [ DEFAULT <value2> ]
      ] ...)
  ]
RETURN <return_type>;
{ IS | AS }
[ <declarations> ]
BEGIN
  <statement>; ...
[ EXCEPTION
  WHEN ... THEN
    <statement>; ...]
END;
```

Where:

`name` is an identifier (optionally schema-qualified) assigned to the object type.

`method_spec` denotes the implementation of an instantiable method that was specified in the `CREATE TYPE` command.

If `INSTANTIABLE` was specified or omitted in `method_spec` of the `CREATE TYPE` command, then there must be a `method_spec` for this method in the `CREATE TYPE BODY` command.

If `NOT INSTANTIABLE` was specified in `method_spec` of the `CREATE TYPE` command, then there must be no `method_spec` for this method in the `CREATE TYPE BODY` command.

`subprogram_spec` denotes the specification of a procedure or function and begins with the specification of either `MEMBER` or `STATIC`. The same qualifier must be used as specified in `subprogram_spec` of the `CREATE TYPE` command.

`proc_name` is an identifier of a procedure specified in the `CREATE TYPE` command. The parameter declarations have the same meaning as described for the `CREATE TYPE` command. They must be specified in the `CREATE TYPE BODY` command in the same manner as in the `CREATE TYPE` command.

Include the `CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION` keyword and function definition to define a constructor function.

`func_name` is an identifier of a function specified in the `CREATE TYPE` command. The parameter declarations have the same meaning as described for the `CREATE TYPE` command and must be specified in the `CREATE TYPE BODY` command in the same manner as in the `CREATE TYPE` command. `return_type` is the data type of the value the function returns and must match the `return_type` given in the `CREATE TYPE` command.

`PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION` is the directive that sets the procedure or function as an autonomous transaction.

`declarations` are variable, cursor, type, or subprogram declarations. If subprogram declarations are included, they must be declared after all other variable, cursor, and type declarations.

`statement` is an SPL program statement.
