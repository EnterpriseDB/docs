<div id="dropping_an_object_type" class="registered_link"></div>

The syntax for deleting an object type is as follows:

```sql
DROP TYPE <objtype>;
```

Where `objtype` is the identifier of the object type to drop. If the definition of `objtype` contains attributes that are themselves object types or collection types, you must drop these nested object types or collection types last.

If an object type body is defined for the object type, the `DROP TYPE` command deletes the object-type body as well as the object-type specification. To re-create the complete object type, you must reissue both the `CREATE TYPE` and `CREATE TYPE BODY` commands.

This example drops the `emp_obj_typ` and the `addr_obj_typ` object types. You must drop `emp_obj_typ` first since it contains `addr_obj_typ` in its definition as an attribute.

```sql
DROP TYPE emp_obj_typ;
DROP TYPE addr_obj_typ;
```

The syntax for deleting an object type body but not the object type specification is:

```sql
DROP TYPE BODY <objtype>;
```

You can re-create the object type body by issuing the `CREATE TYPE BODY` command.

This example drops only the object type body of the `dept_obj_typ`:

```sql
DROP TYPE BODY dept_obj_typ;
```
