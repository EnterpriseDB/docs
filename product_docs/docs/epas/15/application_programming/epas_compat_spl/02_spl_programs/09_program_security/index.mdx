<div id="program_security" class="registered_link"></div>

You can control the security over whether a user can execute an SPL program. You can also control the database objects an SPL program can access for any given user executing the program. These are controlled by the following:

-   Privilege to execute a program
-   Privileges granted on the database objects (including other SPL programs) that a program attempts to access
-   Whether the program is defined with definer’s rights or invoker’s rights
