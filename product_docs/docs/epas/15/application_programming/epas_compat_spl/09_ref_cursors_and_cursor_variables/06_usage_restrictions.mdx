<div id="usage_restrictions" class="registered_link"></div>

The following are restrictions on cursor variable usage:

-   You can't use comparison operators to test cursor variables for equality, inequality, null, or not null.
-   You can't assign null to a cursor variable.
-   You can't store the value of a cursor variable in a database column.
-   Static cursors and cursor variables aren't interchangeable. For example, you can't use a static cursor in an `OPEN FOR` statement.

The table shows the permitted parameter modes for a cursor variable used as a procedure or function parameter. This use depends on the operations on the cursor variable in the procedure or function.

| Operation | IN    | IN OUT | OUT  |
| --------- | ----- | ------ | ---- |
| `OPEN`    | `No`  | `Yes`  | `No` |
| `FETCH`   | `Yes` | `Yes`  | `No` |
| `CLOSE`   | `Yes` | `Yes`  | `No` |

For example, if a procedure performs all three operations&mdash;`OPEN FOR`, `FETCH`, and `CLOSE`&mdash;on a cursor variable declared as the procedure’s formal parameter, then that parameter must be declared with `IN OUT` mode.
