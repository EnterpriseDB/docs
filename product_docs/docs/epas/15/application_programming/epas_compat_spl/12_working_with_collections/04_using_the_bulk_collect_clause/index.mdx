SQL commands that return a result set consisting of a large number of rows might not operate efficiently. This is due to the constant context switching to transfer the entire result set that occurs between the database server and the client. 

You can mitigate this inefficiency by using a collection to gather the entire result set in memory, which the client can then access. You use the `BULK COLLECT` clause to specify the aggregation of the result set into a collection.

You can use the `BULK COLLECT` clause with the `SELECT INTO`, `FETCH INTO`, and `EXECUTE IMMEDIATE` commands. You can also use it with the `RETURNING INTO` clause of the `DELETE`, `INSERT`, and `UPDATE` commands.
