EDB Postgres Advanced Server's stored procedural language (SPL) is a highly productive, procedural programming language for writing custom procedures, functions, triggers, and packages for EDB Postgres Advanced Server. It provides:

-   Full procedural programming functionality to complement the SQL language
-   A single, common language to create stored procedures, functions, triggers, and packages for the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database
-   A seamless development and testing environment
-   The use of reusable code
-   Ease of use

For reference information about the SPL program types, programming statements, control structures, collection types, and collection methods, see [Stored procedural language (SPL) reference](/epas/latest/reference/application_programmer_reference/stored_procedural_language_reference/).
