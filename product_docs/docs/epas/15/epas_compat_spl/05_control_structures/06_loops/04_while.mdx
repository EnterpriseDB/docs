```sql
WHILE <expression> LOOP
    <statements>
END LOOP;
```

The `WHILE` statement repeats a sequence of statements when the condition expression evaluates to `TRUE`. The condition is checked just before each entry to the loop body.

This example uses the `WHILE` statement instead of the `EXIT` statement to determine when to exit the loop:

!!! Note
    The conditional expression used to determine when to exit the loop differs when using `WHILE` versus `EXIT`. The `EXIT` statement terminates the loop when its conditional expression is true. The `WHILE` statement terminates the loop or never begins it when its conditional expression is false.

```sql
DECLARE
    v_counter       NUMBER(2);
BEGIN
    v_counter := 1;
    WHILE v_counter <= 10 LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Iteration # ' || v_counter);
        v_counter := v_counter + 1;
    END LOOP;
END;
```

The following is the output from this example:

```sql
__OUTPUT__
Iteration # 1
Iteration # 2
Iteration # 3
Iteration # 4
Iteration # 5
Iteration # 6
Iteration # 7
Iteration # 8
Iteration # 9
Iteration # 10
```
