```sql
FOR <name> IN [REVERSE] <expression .. expression> LOOP
    <statements>
END LOOP;
```

This form of `FOR` creates a loop that iterates over a range of integer values. The variable `name` is of type `INTEGER` and exists only inside the loop. The two expressions giving the loop range are evaluated once when entering the loop. The iteration step is +1. 

`name` begins with the value of `expression` to the left of `..` and terminates when `name` exceeds the value of `expression` to the right of `..`. Thus the two expressions take on the roles `start-value.. end-value`.

The optional `REVERSE` clause specifies for the loop to iterate in reverse order. The first time through the loop, `name` is set to the value of the right-most `expression`. The loop terminates when the `name` is less than the left-most `expression`.

This example uses a `FOR` loop that iterates from 1 to 10:

```sql
BEGIN
    FOR i IN 1 .. 10 LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Iteration # ' || i);
    END LOOP;
END;
```

The following is the output after using the `FOR` statement:

```sql
__OUTPUT__
Iteration # 1
Iteration # 2
Iteration # 3
Iteration # 4
Iteration # 5
Iteration # 6
Iteration # 7
Iteration # 8
Iteration # 9
Iteration # 10
```

If the start value is greater than the end value, the loop body doesn't execute. No error occurs, as shown by the following example:

```sql
BEGIN
    FOR i IN 10 .. 1 LOOP
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Iteration # ' || i);
    END LOOP;
END;
```

This example has no output as the loop body never executes.

!!! Note
    SPL also supports cursor `FOR` loops. See [Cursor FOR loop](../../08_static_cursors/07_cursor_for_loop/#cursor_for_loop).
