<div id="exception_handling" class="registered_link"></div>

By default, any error occurring in an SPL program stops the program from executing. You can trap errors and recover from them by using a `BEGIN` block with an `EXCEPTION` section. The syntax is an extension of the normal syntax for a `BEGIN` block:

```sql
[ DECLARE
    <declarations> ]
  BEGIN
    <statements>
  EXCEPTION
    WHEN <condition> [ OR <condition> ]... THEN
      <handler_statements>
  [ WHEN <condition> [ OR <condition> ]... THEN
      <handler_statements> ]...
END;
```

If no error occurs, this form of block executes all the statements, and then control passes to the next statement after `END`. If an error occurs in the statements, further processing of the statements is abandoned, and control passes to the `EXCEPTION` list. The list is searched for the first condition matching the error. If a match is found, the corresponding `handler_statements` are executed, and then control passes to the next statement after `END`. If no match is found, the error propagates out as though the `EXCEPTION` clause wasn't there. You can catch the error by an enclosing block with `EXCEPTION`. If there is no enclosing block, it aborts the subprogram.

The special condition named `OTHERS` matches every error type. Condition names aren't case sensitive.

If a new error occurs in the selected `handler_statements`, this `EXCEPTION` clause can't catch it, but it is propagated out. A surrounding `EXCEPTION` clause might catch it.

The following table lists the condition names that you can use.

| Condition name            | Description                                                                                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CASE_NOT_FOUND`          | The application encountered a situation where none of the cases in `CASE` statement evaluates to `TRUE` and there is no `ELSE` condition. |
| `COLLECTION_IS_NULL`      | The application attempted to invoke a collection method on a null collection, such as an uninitialized nested table.                       |
| `CURSOR_ALREADY_OPEN`     | The application attempted to open a cursor that's already open.                                                                          |
| `DUP_VAL_ON_INDEX`        | The application attempted to store a duplicate value that currently exists in a constrained column.                                   |
| `INVALID_CURSOR`          | The application attempted to access an unopened cursor.                                                                                   |
| `INVALID_NUMBER`          | The application encountered a data exception equivalent to SQLSTATE class code 22. `INVALID_NUMBER` is an alias for `VALUE_ERROR`.      |
| `NO_DATA_FOUND`           | No rows satisfy the selection criteria.                                                                                                       |
| `OTHERS`                  | The application encountered an exception that wasn't caught by a prior condition in the exception section.                           |
| `SUBSCRIPT_BEYOND_COUNT`  | The application attempted to reference a subscript of a nested table or varray beyond its initialized or extended size.                   |
| `SUBSCRIPT_OUTSIDE_LIMIT` | The application attempted to reference a subscript or extend a varray beyond its maximum size limit.                                      |
| `TOO_MANY_ROWS`           | The application encountered more than one row that satisfies the selection criteria where only one row is allowed to be returned.       |
| `VALUE_ERROR`             | The application encountered a data exception equivalent to SQLSTATE class code 22. `VALUE_ERROR` is an alias for `INVALID_NUMBER`.      |
| `ZERO_DIVIDE`             | The application tried to divide by zero.                                                                                                  |
| `User-defined Exception`  | See [User-defined exceptions](08_user_defined_exceptions/#user_defined_exceptions).                                                           |

!!! Note
    Condition names `INVALID_NUMBER` and `VALUE_ERROR` aren't compatible with Oracle databases for which these condition names are used for exceptions that result only from a failed conversion of a string to a numeric literal. In addition, for Oracle databases, an `INVALID_NUMBER` exception applies only to SQL statements, while a `VALUE_ERROR` exception applies only to procedural statements.
