You can use the `DELETE` command available in the SQL language in SPL programs.

You can use an expression in the SPL language wherever an expression is allowed in the SQL `DELETE` command. Thus, you can use SPL variables and parameters to supply values to the delete operation.

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE emp_delete (
    p_empno         IN emp.empno%TYPE
)
IS
BEGIN
    DELETE FROM emp WHERE empno = p_empno;

    IF SQL%FOUND THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Deleted Employee # : ' || p_empno);
    ELSE
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee # ' || p_empno || ' not found');
    END IF;
END;
```

The `SQL%FOUND` conditional expression returns `TRUE` if a row is deleted, `FALSE` otherwise. See [Obtaining the result status](08_obtaining_the_result_status/#obtaining_the_result_status) for a discussion of `SQL%FOUND` and other similar expressions.

This example deletes an employee using this procedure:

```text
EXEC emp_delete(9503);

Deleted Employee # : 9503

SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno = 9503;

 empno | ename | job | mgr | hiredate | sal | comm | deptno
-------+-------+-----+-----+----------+-----+------+--------
(0 rows)
```

!!! Note
    You can include the `DELETE` command in a `FORALL` statement. A `FORALL` statement allows a single `DELETE` command to delete multiple rows from values supplied in one or more collections. See [Using the FORALL statement](../12_working_with_collections/03_using_the_forall_statement/#using_the_forall_statement) for more information.
