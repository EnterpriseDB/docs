title: "Opening a cursor"
---

<div id="opening_a_cursor" class="registered_link"></div>

Before you can use a cursor to retrieve rows, you must open it using the `OPEN` statement.

```text
OPEN <name>;
```

`name` is the identifier of a cursor that was previously declared in the declaration section of the SPL program. Don't execute the `OPEN` statement on a cursor that is already open.

This examples shows an `OPEN` statement with its corresponding cursor declaration:

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    CURSOR emp_cur_3 IS SELECT empno, ename FROM emp WHERE deptno = 10
        ORDER BY empno;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_3;
        ...
END;
```
