Once a cursor is open, you can retrieve rows from the cursorâ€™s result set by using the `FETCH` statement.

```sql
FETCH <name> INTO { <record> | <variable> [, <variable_2> ]... };
```

Where:

`name` is the identifier of a previously opened cursor. 

`record` is the identifier of a previously defined record (for example, using `table%ROWTYPE`). 

`variable, variable_2...` are SPL variables that receive the field data from the fetched row. The fields in `record` or `variable, variable_2...` must match in number and order the fields returned in the `SELECT` list of the query given in the cursor declaration. The data types of the fields in the `SELECT` list must match or be implicitly convertible to the data types of the fields in `record` or the data types of `variable, variable_2...`

!!! Note
    A variation of `FETCH INTO` using the `BULK COLLECT` clause can return multiple rows at a time into a collection. See [Using the BULK COLLECT clause](../12_working_with_collections/04_using_the_bulk_collect_clause/#using_the_bulk_collect_clause) for more information on using the `BULK COLLECT` clause with the `FETCH INTO` statement.

The following shows the `FETCH` statement:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    v_empno         NUMBER(4);
    v_ename         VARCHAR2(10);
    CURSOR emp_cur_3 IS SELECT empno, ename FROM emp WHERE deptno = 10
        ORDER BY empno;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_3;
    FETCH emp_cur_3 INTO v_empno, v_ename;
        ...
END;
```

Instead of explicitly declaring the data type of a target variable, you can use `%TYPE` instead. In this way, if the data type of the database column changes, the target variable declaration in the SPL program doesn't have to change. `%TYPE` picks up the new data type of the specified column.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    v_empno         emp.empno%TYPE;
    v_ename         emp.ename%TYPE;
    CURSOR emp_cur_3 IS SELECT empno, ename FROM emp WHERE deptno = 10
        ORDER BY empno;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_3;
    FETCH emp_cur_3 INTO v_empno, v_ename;
        ...
END;
```

If all the columns in a table are retrieved in the order defined in the table, you can use `%ROWTYPE` to define a record into which the `FETCH` statement places the retrieved data. You can then access each field in the record using dot notation:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE cursor_example
IS
    v_emp_rec       emp%ROWTYPE;
    CURSOR emp_cur_1 IS SELECT * FROM emp;
BEGIN
    OPEN emp_cur_1;
    FETCH emp_cur_1 INTO v_emp_rec;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee Number: ' || v_emp_rec.empno);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee Name  : ' || v_emp_rec.ename);
        ...
END;
```
