An SPL program (function, procedure, or package) can begin execution only if any of the following are true:

-   The current user is a superuser.
-   The current user was granted `EXECUTE` privilege on the SPL program.
-   The current user inherits `EXECUTE` privilege on the SPL program by virtue of being a member of a group that has this privilege.
-   `EXECUTE` privilege was granted to the `PUBLIC` group.

Whenever an SPL program is created in EDB Postgres Advanced Server, `EXECUTE` privilege is granted to the `PUBLIC` group by default. Therefore, any user can immediately execute the program.

You can remove this default privilege by using the `REVOKE EXECUTE` command. For example:

```text
REVOKE EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE list_emp FROM PUBLIC;
```

You can then grant explicit `EXECUTE` privilege on the program to individual users or groups.

```text
GRANT EXECUTE ON PROCEDURE list_emp TO john;
```

Now, user `john` can execute the `list_emp` program. Other users who don't meet any of the required conditions can't.

Once a program begins to execute, the next aspect of security is the privilege checks that occur if the program attempts to perform an action on any database object including:

-   Reading or modifying table or view data
-   Creating, modifying, or deleting a database object such as a table, view, index, or sequence
-   Obtaining the current or next value from a sequence
-   Calling another program (function, procedure, or package)

Each such action can be protected by privileges on the database object either allowed or disallowed for the user.

It's possible for a database to have more than one object of the same type with the same name, but each such object belongs to a different schema in the database. If this is the case, which object is being referenced by an SPL program? For more information, see [Database object name resolution](02_database_object_name_resolution).
