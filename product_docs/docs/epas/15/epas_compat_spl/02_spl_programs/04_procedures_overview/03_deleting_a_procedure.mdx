You can delete a procedure from the database using the `DROP PROCEDURE` command.

```text
DROP PROCEDURE [ IF EXISTS ] <name> [ (<parameters>) ]
    [ CASCADE | RESTRICT ];
```

Where `name` is the name of the procedure to drop.

!!! Note
    -   The specification of the parameter list is required in EDB Postgres Advanced Server under certain circumstances such as in an overloaded procedure. Oracle requires that you always omit the parameter list.

    -   Using `IF EXISTS`, `CASCADE`, or `RESTRICT` isn't compatible with Oracle databases. See [Database Compatibility: SQL](../../../epas_compat_sql/50_drop_procedure) for information on these options.

This example drops the procedure `simple_procedure`:

```text
DROP PROCEDURE simple_procedure;
```
