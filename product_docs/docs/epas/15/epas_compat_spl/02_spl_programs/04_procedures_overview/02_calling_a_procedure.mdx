<div id="calling_a_procedure" class="registered_link"></div>

You can invoke a procedure from another SPL program by specifying the procedure name followed by any parameters and a semicolon:

```text
<name> [ ([ <parameters> ]) ];
```

Where:

`name` is the identifier of the procedure.

`parameters` is a list of parameters.

!!! Note
    -   If there are no parameters to pass, you can call the procedure with an empty parameter list, or you can omit the parentheses.

    -   The syntax for calling a procedure is the same as in the preceding syntax diagram when executing it with the `EXEC` command in PSQL or EDB\*Plus. See [Database Compatibility: SQL](../../../epas_compat_sql/63_exec) for information about the `EXEC` command.

This example calls the procedure from an anonymous block:

```text
BEGIN
   simple_procedure;
END;

That's all folks!
```

!!! Note
    Each application has its own way of calling a procedure. For example, a Java application uses the application programming interface JDBC.
