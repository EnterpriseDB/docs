<div id="object_types_and_objects" class="registered_link"></div>

You can use object-oriented programming techniques in SPL. Object-oriented programming as seen in programming languages such as Java and C++ centers on the concept of *objects*. An object represents a real-world entity such as a person, place, or thing. The generic description or definition of a particular object such as a person, for example, is called an *object type*. Specific people such as “Joe” or “Sally” are said to be *objects of object type* person. They are also known as *instances* of the object type person or, simply, person objects.

!!! Note
    -   The terms “database objects” and “objects” are different from the terms "object type" and "object" used in object-oriented programming. Database objects are the entities that can be created in a database, such as tables, views, indexes, and users. In the context of object-oriented program, object type and object refer to specific data structures supported by the SPL programming language to implement object-oriented concepts.

    -   In Oracle, the term *abstract data type* (ADT) describes object types in PL/SQL. The SPL implementation of object types is intended to be compatible with Oracle abstract data types.

    -   EDB Postgres Advanced Server hasn't yet implemented support for some features of object-oriented programming languages.
