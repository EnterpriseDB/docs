Generally, you must declare all variables used in a block in the declaration section of the block. A variable declaration consists of a name that's assigned to the variable and its data type. Optionally, you can initialize the variable to a default value in the variable declaration.

The general syntax of a variable declaration is:

```sql
<name> <type> [ { := | DEFAULT } { <expression> | NULL } ];
```

`name` is an identifier assigned to the variable.

`type` is the data type assigned to the variable.

`[ := expression ]`, if given, specifies the initial value assigned to the variable when the block is entered. If the clause isn't given then the variable is initialized to the SQL `NULL` value.

The default value is evaluated every time the block is entered. So, for example, assigning `SYSDATE` to a variable of type `DATE` causes the variable to have the time of the current invocation, not the time when the procedure or function was precompiled.

This procedure shows some variable declarations that use defaults consisting of string and numeric expressions:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE dept_salary_rpt (
    p_deptno        NUMBER
)
IS
    todays_date     DATE := SYSDATE;
    rpt_title       VARCHAR2(60) := 'Report For Department # ' || p_deptno
                             || ' on ' || todays_date;
    base_sal        INTEGER := 35525;
    base_comm_rate  NUMBER := 1.33333;
    base_annual     NUMBER := ROUND(base_sal * base_comm_rate, 2);
BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(rpt_title);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Base Annual Salary: ' || base_annual);
END;
```

The following output of the procedure shows that default values in the variable declarations are assigned to the variables:

```sql
EXEC dept_salary_rpt(20);
__OUTPUT__
Report For Department # 20 on 10-JUL-07 16:44:45
Base Annual Salary: 47366.55
```
