<div id="user_defined_record_types_and_record_variables" class="registered_link"></div>

You can declare records based on a table definition using the `%ROWTYPE` attribute, as shown in [Using %ROWTYPE in record declarations](03_using__row_type_in_record_declarations). You can also define a new record structure that isn't tied to a particular table definition.

You use the `TYPE IS RECORD` statement to create the definition of a record type. A *record type* is a definition of a record made up of one or more identifiers and their corresponding data types. You can't use a record type by itself to manipulate data.

The syntax for a `TYPE IS RECORD` statement is:

```text
TYPE <rec_type> IS RECORD ( <fields> )
```

Where `fields` is a comma-separated list of one or more field definitions of the following form:

```text
<field_name> <data_type> [NOT NULL][{:= | DEFAULT} <default_value>]
```

Where:

-  `rec_type` is an identifier assigned to the record type.
-  `field_name` is the identifier assigned to the field of the record type.
-  `data_type` specifies the data type of `field_name`.
-  The `DEFAULT` clause assigns a default data value for the corresponding field. The data type of the default expression must match the data type of the column. If you don't specify a default, then the default is `NULL`.

A *record variable* or *record* is an instance of a record type. A record is declared from a record type. The properties of the record such as its field names and types are inherited from the record type.

The following is the syntax for a record declaration:

```text
<record> <rectype>
```

`record` is an identifier assigned to the record variable. `rectype` is the identifier of a previously defined record type. Once declared, you can't then use a record to hold data.

Use dot notation to reference the fields in the record:

```text
<record>.<field>
```

`record` is a previously declared record variable and `field` is the identifier of a field belonging to the record type from which `record` is defined.

This `emp_sal_query` procedure uses a user-defined record type and record variable:

```text
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE emp_sal_query (
    p_empno         IN emp.empno%TYPE
)
IS
    TYPE emp_typ IS RECORD (
        ename       emp.ename%TYPE,
        job         emp.job%TYPE,
        hiredate    emp.hiredate%TYPE,
        sal         emp.sal%TYPE,
        deptno      emp.deptno%TYPE
    );
    r_emp           emp_typ;
    v_avgsal        emp.sal%TYPE;
BEGIN
    SELECT ename, job, hiredate, sal, deptno
        INTO r_emp.ename, r_emp.job, r_emp.hiredate, r_emp.sal, r_emp.deptno
        FROM emp WHERE empno = p_empno;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee # : ' || p_empno);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Name       : ' || r_emp.ename);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Job        : ' || r_emp.job);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Hire Date  : ' || r_emp.hiredate);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Salary     : ' || r_emp.sal);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Dept #     : ' || r_emp.deptno);

    SELECT AVG(sal) INTO v_avgsal
        FROM emp WHERE deptno = r_emp.deptno;
    IF r_emp.sal > v_avgsal THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee''s salary is more than the '
            || 'department average of ' || v_avgsal);
    ELSE
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Employee''s salary does not exceed the '
            || 'department average of ' || v_avgsal);
    END IF;
END;
```

Instead of specifying data type names, you can use the `%TYPE` attribute for the field data types in the record type definition.

The following is the output from executing this stored procedure:

```text
EXEC emp_sal_query(7698);

Employee # : 7698
Name       : BLAKE
Job        : MANAGER
Hire Date  : 01-MAY-81 00:00:00
Salary     : 2850.00
Dept #     : 30
Employee's salary is more than the department average of 1566.67
```
