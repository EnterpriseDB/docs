You can use the EDB Postgres Advanced Server interactive installer to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on Windows. The interactive installer is available from [Downloads page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/advanced-downloads) on the EDB website.

You can invoke the graphical installer in different installation modes to perform an EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation:

-   For information about using the graphical installer, see [Performing a Graphical Installation on Windows](performing_a_graphical_installation_on_windows/#performing_a_graphical_installation_on_windows).
-   For information about performing an unattended installation, see [Performing an Unattended Installation](invoking_the_graphical_installer_from_the_command_line/performing_an_unattended_installation/#performing_an_unattended_installation).
-   For information about performing an installation with limited privileges, see [Performing an Installation with Limited Privileges](invoking_the_graphical_installer_from_the_command_line/performing_an_installation_with_limited_privileges/#performing_an_installation_with_limited_privileges).
-   For information about the command line options you can include when invoking the installer, see [Reference - Command Line Options](invoking_the_graphical_installer_from_the_command_line/reference_command_line_options/#reference_command_line_options).

During the installation, the graphical installer copies a number of temporary files to the location specified by the `TEMP` environment variable. You can optionally specify an alternate location for the temporary files by modifying the value of the `TEMP` environment variable on the command line:

```text
SET TEMP=temp_file_location
```

Where `temp_file_location` specifies the alternate location for the temporary files and must match the permissions with the `TEMP` environment variable.

!!! Note
    If you are invoking the installer to perform a system upgrade, the installer preserves the configuration options specified during the previous installation.

## Setting cluster preferences during a graphical installation

During an installation, the graphical installer invokes the PostgreSQL `initdb` utility to initialize a cluster. If you are using the graphical installer, you can use the `INITDBOPTS` environment variable to specify your `initdb` preferences. Before invoking the graphical installer, set the value of `INITDBOPTS` at the command line, specifying one or more cluster options. For example:

```text
SET INITDBOPTS= -k -E=UTF-8
```

If you specify values in `INITDBOPTS` that are also provided by the installer (such as the `â€“D` option, which specifies the installation directory), the value specified in the graphical installer supersedes the value if specified in `INITDBOPTS`.

For more information about using `initdb` cluster configuration options, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-initdb.html). In addition to the cluster configuration options documented in the PostgreSQL core documentation, EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports the following `initdb` options:

`--no-redwood-compat`

`--no-redwood-compat` instructs the server to create the cluster in PostgreSQL mode. When the cluster is created in PostgreSQL mode, the name of the database superuser is `postgres` and the name of the default database is `postgres`. A small subset of Advanced Server features compatible with Oracle databases are available with this mode. However, we recommend using Advanced Server in redwood compatibility mode to have access to all its Oracle compatibility features.

`--redwood-like`

`--redwood-like` instructs the server to use an escape character (an empty string ('')) following the `LIKE` (or PostgreSQL compatible `ILIKE`) operator in a SQL statement that is compatible with Oracle syntax.

`--icu-short-form`

`--icu-short-form` creates a cluster that uses a default ICU (International Components for Unicode) collation for all databases in the cluster. For more information about Unicode collations, see [Basic Unicode collation algorithm concepts](../../../tools_utilities_and_components/application_developer_tools/06_unicode_collation_algorithm).
