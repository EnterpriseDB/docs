!!! Note
    After uninstalling EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the cluster data files remain intact, and the service user persists. You can manually remove the cluster `data` and service user from the system.

## Uninstalling on RHEL/OL/AlmaLinux/Rocky Linux

You can use variations of the `rpm`, `yum`, or `dnf` command to remove installed packages. Removing a package doesn't damage the EDB Postgres Advanced Server `data` directory.

Include the `-e` option when invoking the `rpm` command to remove an installed package:

```text
rpm -e <package_name>
```

Where `package_name` is the name of the package that you want to remove.

You can use the `yum remove` or `dnf remove` command to remove a package installed by `yum` or `dnf`. To remove a package, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter the appropriate command.

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum remove <package_name>
    ```

-   On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8:

    ```text
    dnf remove <package_name>
    ```

Where `package_name` is the name of the package that you want to remove.

`yum` and `rpm` don't remove a package that's required by another package. If you attempt to remove a package that satisfies a package dependency, `yum` or `rpm` provides a warning.

!!! Note
    In RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8, removing a package also removes all its dependencies that aren't required by other packages. To override this default behavior of RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8, disable the `clean_requirements_on_remove` parameter in the `/etc/yum.conf` file.

To uninstall EDB Postgres Advanced Server and its dependent packages, use the appropriate command.

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum remove edb-as15-server*
    ```

-   On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8:

    ```text
    dnf remove edb-as15-server*
    ```

## Uninstalling on Debian or Ubuntu

-   To uninstall EDB Postgres Advanced Server, invoke the following command. The configuration files and data directory remains intact.

    ```text
    apt-get remove edb-as15-server*
    ```

-   To uninstall EDB Postgres Advanced Server, configuration files, and data directory, invoke the following command:

    ```text
    apt-get purge edb-as15-server*
    ```
