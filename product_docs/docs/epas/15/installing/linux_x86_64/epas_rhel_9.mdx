## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Set up the EDB repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

  To determine if your repository exists, enter this command:

  `dnf repolist | grep enterprisedb`

  If no output is generated, the repository isn't installed.

  To set up the EDB repository:

  1. Go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).

  1. Select the button that provides access to the EDB repo.

  1. Select the platform and software that you want to download.

- Install the EPEL repository

  ```shell
  sudo dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-9.noarch.rpm
  ```

- If you are also installing PostGIS, enable additional repositories to resolve dependencies:
  ```shell
  ARCH=$( /bin/arch ) subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for-rhel-9-${ARCH}-rpms"
  ```
  !!!note
  If you are using a public cloud RHEL image, `subscription manager` may not be enabled and enabling it may incur unnecessary charges. Equivalent packages may be available under a different name such as `codeready-builder-for-rhel-9-rhui-rpms`. Consult the documentation for the RHEL image you are using to determine how to install `codeready-builder`.

## Install the package

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-as<xx>-server
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of the EDB Postgres Advanced server you are installing. For example, if you are installing version 15, the package name would be `edb-as15-server`.

To install an individual component:

```shell
sudo dnf -y install <package_name>
```

Where `package_name` can be any of the available packages from the [available package list](/epas/15/installing/linux_install_details/rpm_packages/).

Installing the server package creates an operating system user named enterprisedb. The user is assigned a user ID (UID) and a group ID (GID). The user has no default password. Use the `passwd` command to assign a password for the user. The default shell for the user is `bash` and the user's home directory is `/var/lib/edb/as15`.

## Initial configuration

This section steps you through getting started with your cluster including logging in, ensuring the installation and initial configuration was successful, connecting to your cluster, and creating the user password.

First you need to initialize and start the database cluster. The `edb-as-15-setup` script creates a cluster in Oracle-compatible mode with the `edb` sample database in the cluster. To create a cluster in Postgres mode, see [Initializing the cluster in Postgres mode](../linux_install_details/managing_an_advanced_server_installation/#initializing-the-cluster-in-postgres-mode).

```shell
sudo PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS="-E UTF-8" /usr/edb/as15/bin/edb-as-15-setup initdb

sudo systemctl start edb-as-15
```

To work in your cluster, login as the enterprisedb user. Connect to the database server using the psql command line client (although you can use a client of your choice with the appropriate connection string).

```shell
sudo su - enterprisedb

psql edb
```

The server runs with the `peer` or `ident` permission by default. You can change the authentication method by modifying the `pg_hba.conf` file.

Before changing the authentication method, assign a password to the database superuser, enterprisedb. For more information on changing the authentication, see [modifying the pg_hba.conf file](../../database_administration/01_configuration_parameters/01_setting_new_parameters/#modifying-the-pg_hbaconf-file).

```sql
ALTER ROLE enterprisedb IDENTIFIED BY password;
```

## Experiment

Now you are ready to create and connect to a database, create a table, insert data in a table, and view the data from the table.

First let's create a database to hold human resource information named `hr` using psql.

```sql
# running in psql
CREATE DATABASE hr;
__OUTPUT__
CREATE DATABASE
```

Connect to the `hr` database inside psql.

```
\c hr
__OUTPUT__
psql (15.2.0, server 15.2.0)
You are now connected to database "hr" as user "enterprisedb".
```

Create columns to hold department numbers, unique department names, and locations.

```
CREATE TABLE public.dept (deptno numeric(2) NOT NULL CONSTRAINT dept_pk
PRIMARY KEY, dname varchar(14) CONSTRAINT dept_dname_uq UNIQUE, loc
varchar(13));
__OUTPUT__
CREATE TABLE
```

Insert values into the `dept` table.

```
INSERT INTO dept VALUES (10,'ACCOUNTING','NEW YORK');
__OUTPUT__
INSERT 0 1
```

```
INSERT into dept VALUES (20,'RESEARCH','DALLAS');
__OUTPUT__
INSERT 0 1
```

View what is in the table by selecting the values from the table.

```
SELECT * FROM dept;
__OUTPUT__
deptno  |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
10      | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
20      | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
(2 rows)
```
