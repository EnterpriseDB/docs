You can create a local repository to act as a host for the EDB Postgres Advanced Server native packages if the server on which you want to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server or supporting components can't directly access the EDB repository. This is a high-level listing of the steps required. Modify the process for your network.

To create and use a local repository, you must:

-   Use `yum` or `dnf` to install the `epel-release`, `yum-utils`, and `createrepo` packages.

    On RHEL or CentOS 7.x:

    ```bash
    yum install epel-release
    yum install yum-utils
    yum install createrepo
    ```

    On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8.x:

    ```bash
    dnf install epel-release
    dnf install yum-utils
    dnf install createrepo
    ```

-   Create a directory in which to store the repository:

    ```text
    mkdir /srv/repos
    ```

-   Copy the RPM installation packages to your local repository. You can download the individual packages or use a tarball to populate the repository. The packages are available from the EDB repository at <https://repos.enterprisedb.com/>.

-   Sync the RPM packages, and create the repository.

    ```text
    reposync -r edbas15 -p /srv/repos
    createrepo /srv/repos
    ```

-   Install your preferred webserver on the host that acts as your local repository, and ensure that the repository directory is accessible to the other servers on your network.

-   On each isolated database server, configure `yum` or `dnf` to pull updates from the mirrored repository on your local network. For example, you might create a repository configuration file called `/etc/yum.repos.d/edb-repo` with connection information that specifies:

    ```text
    [edbas15]
    name=EnterprisEDB Postgres Advanced Server 15
    baseurl=https://yum.your_domain.com/edbas15
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0
    ```

After specifying the location and connection information for your local repository, you can use `yum` or `dnf` commands to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server and its supporting components on the isolated servers. For example:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as15-server
    ```

-   On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install edb-as15-server
    ```
