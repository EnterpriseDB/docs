Unless otherwise noted, the commands and paths in these instructions assume that you performed an installation using the native packages.

## Starting and stopping services

A service is a program that runs in the background and doesn't require user interaction. A service provides no user interface. You can configure a service to start at boot time or manually on demand. Services are best controlled using the platform-specific operating system service control utility. Many of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server supporting components are services.

The following table lists the names of the services that control EDB Postgres Advanced Server and services that control EDB Postgres Advanced Server supporting components.

| EDB Postgres Advanced Server component name | Linux service Name       | Debian service name                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server   | edb-as-15                | edb-as@15-main                          |
| pgAgent                        | edb-pgagent-15           | edb-as15-pgagent                        |
| PgBouncer                      | edb-pgbouncer-1.15       | edb-pgbouncer115                        |
| pgPool-II                      | edb-pgpool-4.1           | edb-pgpool41                            |
| Slony                          | edb-slony-replication-15 | edb-as15-slony-replication              |
| EFM                            | edb-efm-4.0              | edb-efm-4.0                             |

You can use the Linux command line to control EDB Postgres Advanced Server's database server and the services of EDB Postgres Advanced Server's supporting components. The commands that control the EDB Postgres Advanced Server service on a Linux platform are host specific.

### Controlling a service on RHEL/CentOS 7.x or RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8.x

If your installation of EDB Postgres Advanced Server resides on version 7.x | 8.x of RHEL and CentOS, you must use the `systemctl` command to control the EDB Postgres Advanced Server service and supporting components.

The `systemctl` command must be in your search path and you must invoke it with superuser privileges. To use the command, open a command line, and enter:

```text
systemctl <action> <service_name>
```

Where:

`service_name` specifies the name of the service.

`action` specifies the action taken by the service command. Specify:

-   `start` to start the service.
-   `stop` to stop the service.
-   `restart` to stop and then start the service.
-   `status` to discover the current status of the service.

### Controlling a service on Debian 10.x or Ubuntu 18.04 | 20.04

If your installation of EDB Postgres Advanced Server resides on version 18.04 | 20.04 of Ubuntu, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following commands (using bundled scripts) to manage the service. Use the following commands to:

-   Discover the current status of a service:

    ```text
    /usr/edb/as15/bin/epas_ctlcluster 15 main status
    ```

-   Stop a service:

    ```text
    /usr/edb/as15/bin/epas_ctlcluster 15 main stop
    ```

-   Restart a service:

    ```text
    /usr/edb/as15/bin/epas_ctlcluster 15 main restart
    ```

-   Reload a service:

    ```text
    /usr/edb/as15/bin/epas_ctlcluster 15 main reload
    ```

-   Control the component services:

    ```text
    systemctl restart edb-as@15-main
    ```

### Using pg_ctl to control EDB Postgres Advanced Server

You can use the `pg_ctl` utility to control an EDB Postgres Advanced Server service from the command line on any platform. `pg_ctl` allows you to:

-  Start, stop, or restart the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database server
-  Reload the configuration parameters
-  Display the status of a running server 

To invoke the utility, assume the identity of the cluster owner. In the home directory of EDB Postgres Advanced Server, issue the command:

```text
./bin/pg_ctl -D <data_directory> <action>
```

`data_directory` is the location of the data controlled by the EDB Postgres Advanced Server cluster.

`action` specifies the action taken by the `pg_ctl` utility. Specify:

-   `start` to start the service.
-   `stop` to stop the service.
-   `restart` to stop and then start the service.
-   `reload` to send the server a `SIGHUP` signal, reloading configuration parameters
-   `status` to discover the current status of the service.

For more information about using the `pg_ctl` utility or the command line options available, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-pg-ctl.html).

#### Choosing between pg_ctl and the service command

You can use the `pg_ctl` utility to manage the status of an EDB Postgres Advanced Server cluster. However, it's important to note that `pg_ctl` doesn't alert the operating system service controller to changes in the status of a server. We recommend using the `service` command when possible.

### Configuring component services to autostart at system reboot

After installing, configuring, and starting the services of EDB Postgres Advanced Server supporting components on a Linux system, you must manually configure your system to autostart the service when your system restarts. To configure a service to autostart on a Linux system, open a command line, assume superuser privileges, and enter the command.

On a Redhat-compatible Linux system, enter:

```text
/sbin/chkconfig <service_name> on
```

Where `service_name` specifies the name of the service.

## Connecting to EDB Postgres Advanced Server with edb-psql

`edb-psql` is a command line client application that allows you to execute SQL commands and view the results. To open the `edb-psql` client, the client must be in your search path. The executable resides in the `bin` directory under your EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation.

Use the following command and options to start the `edb-psql` client:

```text
psql -d edb -U enterprisedb
```

Where:

`-d` specifies the database to which `edb-psql` connects.

`-U` specifies the identity of the database user to use for the session.

`edb-psql` is a symbolic link to a binary called `psql`, a modified version of the PostgreSQL community `psql`, with added support for EDB Postgres Advanced Server features. For more information about using the command line client, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-psql.html).

### Managing authentication on a Debian or Ubuntu host

By default, the server is running with the peer or md5 permission on a Debian or Ubuntu host. You can change the authentication method by modifying the `pg_hba.conf` file, located under `/etc/edb-as/15/main/`.

For more information about modifying the `pg_hba.conf` file, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

## Configuring a package installation

The packages that install the database server component create a unit file on version 7.x or 8.x hosts and service startup scripts.

### Creating a database cluster and starting the service

The PostgreSQL `initdb` command creates a database cluster. When installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server with an RPM package, the `initdb` executable is in `/usr/edb/asx.x/bin`. After installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you must manually configure the service and invoke `initdb` to create your cluster. When invoking `initdb`, you can:

-   Specify environment options on the command line.
-   Include the `systemd` service manager on RHEL/CentOS 7.x or RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8.x and use a service configuration file to configure the environment.

For more information, see the [`initdb` documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-initdb.html).

After specifying any options in the service configuration file, you can create the database cluster and start the service. The steps are platform specific.

#### On RHEL/CentOS 7.x or RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8.x

To invoke `initdb` on a RHEL/CentOS 7.x or Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8.x system with the options specified in the service configuration file, assume the identity of the operating system superuser:

```text
su - root
```

To initialize a cluster with the non-default values, you can use the `PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS` environment variable. You can initialize the cluster using the `edb-as-15-setup` script under `EPAS_Home/bin`.

To invoke `initdb`, export the `PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS` environment variable:

```text
PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS="-E UTF-8" /usr/edb/as15/bin/edb-as-15-setup initdb
```

After creating the cluster, use `systemctl` to start, stop, or restart the service:

```text
systemctl { start | stop | restart } edb-as-15
```

#### On Debian 10.x or Ubuntu 18.04 | 20.04

You can initialize multiple clusters using the bundled scripts. To create a new cluster, assume `root` privileges, and invoke the bundled script:

```text
/usr/bin/epas_createcluster 15 main2
```

To start a new cluster:

```text
/usr/bin/epas_ctlcluster 15 main2 start  
```

To list all the available clusters:

```text
/usr/bin/epas_lsclusters
```

!!! Note
    The data directory is created under `/var/lib/edb-as/15/main2`, and the configuration directory is created under `/etc/edb-as/15/main/`.


## Specifying cluster options with INITDBOPTS

You can use the `INITDBOPTS` variable to specify your cluster configuration preferences. By default, the `INITDBOPTS` variable is commented out in the service configuration file. Unless you modify it, when you run the service startup script, the new cluster is created in a mode compatible with Oracle databases. Clusters created in this mode contain a database named `edb` and have a database superuser named `enterprisedb`.

### Initializing the cluster in Oracle mode

If you initialize the database using Oracle compatibility mode, the installation includes:

-   Data dictionary views compatible with Oracle databases.
-   Oracle data type conversions.
-   Date values displayed in a format compatible with Oracle syntax.
-   Support for Oracle-styled concatenation rules. If you concatenate a string value with a `NULL` value, the returned value is the value of the string.
-   Support for the following Oracle built-in packages.

| Package          | Functionality compatible with Oracle databases                                                                                                                               |

### Initializing the cluster in Postgres mode

Clusters created in PostgreSQL mode don't include compatibility features. To create a new cluster in PostgreSQL mode, remove the pound sign (#) in front of the `INITDBOPTS` variable, enabling the `"--no-redwood-compat"` option. Clusters created in PostgreSQL mode contain a database named `postgres` and have a database superuser named `postgres`.

You can also specify multiple `initdb` options. For example, the following statement creates a database cluster without compatibility features for Oracle. The cluster contains a database named `postgres` that's owned by a user named `alice`. The cluster uses `UTF-8` encoding.

```text
INITDBOPTS="--no-redwood-compat -U alice --locale=en_US.UTF-8"
```

If you initialize the database using `"--no-redwood-compat"` mode, the installation includes the following package:

| Package            | Functionality noncompatible with Oracle databases                                                               |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `dbms_aqadm`       | Provides supporting procedures for Advanced Queueing functionality.                                              |
| `dbms_aq`          | Provides message queueing and processing for EDB Postgres Advanced Server.                                                    |
| `edb_bulkload`     | Provides direct/conventional data loading capability when loading huge amount of data into a database.           |
| `edb_gen`          | Provides miscellaneous packages to run built-in packages.                                                        |
| `edb_objects`      | Provides Oracle-compatible objects such as packages and procedures.                                             |
| `waitstates`       | Provides monitor session blocking.                                                                               |
| `edb_dblink_libpq` | Provides link to foreign databases via libpq.                                                                    |
| `edb_dblink_oci`   | Provides link to foreign databases via OCI.                                                                      |
| `snap_tables`      | Creates tables to hold wait information. Included with DRITA scripts.                                            |
| `snap_functions`   | Creates functions to return a list of snap ids and the time the snapshot was taken. Included with DRITA scripts. |
| `sys_stats`        | Provides OS performance statistics.                                                                              |

In addition to the cluster configuration options documented in the PostgreSQL core documentation, EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports the following `initdb` options:

`--no-redwood-compat`

Include the `--no-redwood-compat` keywords to create the cluster in PostgreSQL mode. When the cluster is created in PostgreSQL mode, the name of the database superuser is `postgres`, and the name of the default database is `postgres`. The few EDB Postgres Advanced Server features compatible with Oracle databases are available with this mode. However, we recommend using the EDB Postgres Advanced Server in redwood compatibility mode to use all its features.

`--redwood-like`

Include the `--redwood-like` keywords to use an escape character, that is, an empty string (''), following the `LIKE` (or PostgreSQL-compatible `ILIKE`) operator in a SQL statement that's compatible with Oracle syntax.

`--icu-short-form`

Include the `--icu-short-form` keywords to create a cluster that uses a default International Components for Unicode (ICU) collation for all databases in the cluster. For more information about Unicode collations, see [Unicode collation algorithm](../../epas_guide/03_database_administration/06_unicode_collation_algorithm/).

For more information about using `initdb` and the available cluster configuration options, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-initdb.html).

You can also view online help for `initdb` by assuming superuser privileges and entering:

```text
/path_to_initdb_installation_directory/initdb --help
```

Where `path_to_initdb_installation_directory` specifies the location of the `initdb` binary file.

On a RHEL/CentOS 7.x or RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8.x host, the unit file is named `edb-as-15.service` and resides in `/usr/lib/systemd/system`. The unit file contains references to the location of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server `data` directory. Avoid making any modifications directly to the unit file because they might be overwritten during package upgrades.

By default, data files reside under `/var/lib/edb/as15/data` directory. To use a data directory that resides in a non-default location:

-   Create a copy of the unit file under the `/etc` directory:

    ```text
    cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-15.service /etc/systemd/system/
    ```

-   After copying the unit file to the new location, create the service file `/etc/systemd/system/edb-as-15.service`.

-   Update the following values with new location of data directory in the `/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-15.service` file:

    ```text
    Environment=PGDATA=/var/lib/edb/as15/data
    PIDFile=/var/lib/edb/as15/data/postmaster.pid
    ```

-   Delete the content of the `/etc/systemd/system/edb-as-15.service` file except the following line:

    ```text
    .include /lib/systemd/system/edb-as-15.service
    ```

-   Run the following command to initialize the cluster at the new location:

    ```text
    PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS="-E UTF-8" /usr/edb/as15/bin/edb-as-15-setup initdb
    ```

-   Use the following command to reload `systemd`, updating the modified service scripts:

    ```text
    systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

-   Start the EDB Postgres Advanced Server service with the following command:

    ```text
    systemctl start edb-as-15
    ```

### Configuring SELinux policy to change the data directory location on RHEL/CentOS 7.x or RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8.x

By default, the data files reside under the `/var/lib/edb/as15/data` directory. To change the default data directory location depending on individual environment preferences, you must configure the SELinux policy:

-   Stop the server:

    ```text
    systemctl stop edb-as-15
    ```

-   Check the status of SELinux using the `getenforce` or `sestatus` command:

    ```text
    # getenforce
    Enforcing

    # sestatus
    SELinux status:                 enabled
    SELinuxfs mount:                /sys/fs/selinux
    SELinux root directory:         /etc/selinux
    Loaded policy name:             targeted
    Current mode:                   enforcing
    Mode from config file:          enforcing
    Policy MLS status:              enabled
    Policy deny_unknown status:     allowed
    Max kernel policy version:      31
    ```

-   View the SELinux context of the default database location:

    ```text
    ls -lZ /var/lib/edb/as15/data
    drwx------. enterprisedb enterprisedb unconfined_u:object_r:var_lib_t:s0 log
    ```

-   Create a new directory for a new location of the database:

    ```text
    mkdir /opt/edb
    ```

-   Move the data directory to `/opt/edb`:

    ```text
    mv /var/lib/edb/as15/data /opt/edb/
    ```

-   Create a file `edb-as-15.service` under `/etc/systemd/system` to include the location of a new data directory:

    ```text
    .include /lib/systemd/system/edb-as-15.service
    [Service]
    Environment=PGDATA=/opt/edb/data
    PIDFile=/opt/edb/data/postmaster.pid
    ```

-   Use the `semanage` utility to set the context mapping for `/opt/edb/`. The mapping is written to `/etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file.contexts.local` file.

    ```text
    semanage fcontext --add --equal /var/lib/edb/as15/data /opt/edb
    ```

-   Apply the context mapping using the `restorecon` utility:

    ```text
    restorecon -rv /opt/edb/
    ```

-   Reload `systemd` to modify the service script :

    ```text
    systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

-   With the `/opt/edb` location labeled correctly with the context, start the service:

    ```text
    systemctl start edb-as-15
    ```

## Starting multiple postmasters with different clusters

You can configure EDB Postgres Advanced Server to use multiple postmasters, each with its own database cluster. The steps required are version specific to the Linux host.

### On RHEL/CentOS 7.x or RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8.x

The `edb-as15-server-core` RPM for version 7.x | 8.x contains a unit file that starts the EDB Postgres Advanced Server instance. The file allows you to start multiple services, with unique `data` directories and monitor different ports. You need to have `root` access to invoke or modify the script.

This example creates an EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation with two instances. The secondary instance is named `secondary`.

-   Make a copy of the default file with the new name. As noted at the top of the file, all modifications must reside under `/etc`. You must pick a name that isn't already used in `/etc/systemd/system`.

    ```text
    cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-15.service /etc/systemd/system/secondary-edb-as-15.service
    ```

-   Edit the file, changing `PGDATA` to point to the new `data` directory that you'll create the cluster against.

-   Create the target `PGDATA` with user `enterprisedb`.

-   Run `initdb`, specifying the setup script:

    ```text
    /usr/edb/as15/bin/edb-as-15-setup initdb secondary-edb-as-15
    ```

-   Edit the `postgresql.conf` file for the new instance, specifying the port, the IP address, TCP/IP settings, and so on.

-   Make sure that the new cluster runs after a reboot:

    ```text
    systemctl enable secondary-edb-as-15
    ```

-   Start the second cluster:

    ```text
    systemctl start secondary-edb-as-15
    ```
