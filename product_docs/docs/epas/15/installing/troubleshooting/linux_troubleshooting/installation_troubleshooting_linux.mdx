### Difficulty displaying Java-based applications

If you encounter difficulty displaying Java-based server features (controls or text not being displayed correctly, or blank windows), upgrading to the latest `libxcb-xlib` libraries should correct the problem on most distributions. See the [Java bug database](http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6532373) for other possible workarounds.

### The installation fails to complete eue to existing data directory contents

If an installation fails to complete due to an existing content in the data directory, the server writes an error message to the server logs:

`A data directory is neither empty, or a recognisable data directory.`

If you encounter a similar message, you should confirm that the data directory is empty; the presence of files (including the system-generated `lost+found` folder) prevents the installation from completing. Either remove the files from the data directory, or specify a different location for the data directory before re-invoking the installer to complete the installation.

### Difficulty installing the EPEL release package

If you encounter difficulty when installing the `EPEL` release package, you can use the following command to install the `epel-release` package on RHEL/CentOS 7.x and RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8.x:

```text
yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
```

You might need to enable the `[extras]` repository definition in the `CentOS-Base.repo` file (located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`). If `yum` cannot access a repository that contains `epel-release`, an error message appears:

```text
No package epel available.
Error: Nothing to do
```

If you receive this error, you can download the `EPEL` rpm package, and install it manually. To manually install `EPEL`, download the rpm package, assume superuser privileges, navigate into the directory that contains the package, and install `EPEL` with the command:

```text
yum -y install epel-release

dnf -y install epel-release
```
