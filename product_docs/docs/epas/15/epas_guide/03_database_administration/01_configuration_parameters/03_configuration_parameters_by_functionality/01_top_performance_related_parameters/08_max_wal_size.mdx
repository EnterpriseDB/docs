`max_wal_size` specifies the maximum size for the WAL to reach between automatic WAL checkpoints. This is a soft limit. WAL size can exceed `max_wal_size` under special circumstances, such as when under a heavy load, with a failing archive_command, or with a high `wal_keep_segments` setting.

Increasing this parameter can increase the amount of time needed for crash recovery. You can set this parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.
