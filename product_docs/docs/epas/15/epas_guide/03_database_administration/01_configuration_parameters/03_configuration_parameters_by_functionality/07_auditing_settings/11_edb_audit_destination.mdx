Specifies whether to record the audit log information in the directory as given by the `edb_audit_directory` parameter or to the directory and file managed by the `syslog` process. Set to `file` to use the directory specified by `edb_audit_directory`.

Set to `syslog` to use the syslog process and its location as configured in the `/etc/syslog.conf` file. The `syslog` setting is valid only for EDB Postgres Advanced Server running on a Linux host. It isn't supported on Windows systems.

!!! Note
    In recent Linux versions, `syslog` was replaced with `rsyslog`, and the configuration file is in `/etc/rsyslog.conf`.
