If WAL disk usage stays below the value specified by `min_wal_size`, old WAL files are recycled for future use at a checkpoint rather than removed. This feature ensures that enough WAL space is reserved to handle spikes in WAL usage, like when running large batch jobs. You can set this parameter in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.
