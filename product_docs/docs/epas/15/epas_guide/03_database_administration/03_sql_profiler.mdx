Inefficient SQL code is a leading cause of database performance problems. The challenge for database administrators and developers is locating and then optimizing this code in large, complex systems.

SQL Profiler helps you locate and optimize poorly running SQL code.

Specific features and benefits of SQL Profiler include:

-   On-demand traces. You can capture SQL traces at any time by manually setting up your parameters and starting the trace.
-   Scheduled traces. If the current time isn't convenient, you can also specify your trace parameters and schedule them to run later.
-   Save traces. Execute your traces and save them for later review.
-   Trace filters. Selectively filter SQL captures by database and by user, or capture every SQL statement sent by all users against all databases.
-   Trace output analyzer. A graphical table lets you quickly sort and filter queries by duration or statement. A graphical or text-based `EXPLAIN` plan lays out your query paths and joins.
-   Index Advisor integration. After you find your slow queries and optimize them, you can also let Index Advisor recommend the creation of underlying table indices to further improve performance.

## Installing and enabling the SQL Profiler extension

See [Installing the SQL Profiler extension](/pem/latest/profiling_workloads/installing_sql_profiler/).

## Upgrading to the extension


If you are upgrading from v4.0 (or an earlier version) of SQL Profiler, where the functions where created by loading the SQL file included in a plugin, first migrate to the extension and later update to 4.1:

```
edb=# CREATE EXTENSION sql_profiler VERSION '4.0';

CREATE EXTENSION

edb=# ALTER EXTENSION sql_profiler UPDATE TO '4.1';

ALTER EXTENSION

edb=#
```
