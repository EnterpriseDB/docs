## Hard limits

The following table describes various hard limits of PostgreSQL. However, practical limits such as performance limitations or available disk space might apply before absolute hard limits are reached.

| Item                     | Upper limit                                                           | Comment                                                                |

!!! Note
    -   The maximum number of columns for a table is further reduced as the tuple being stored must fit in a single 8192-byte heap page. For example, excluding the tuple header, a tuple made up of 1600 `int` columns consumes 6400 bytes and can be stored in a heap page. But a tuple of 1600 `bigint` columns consumes 12800 bytes and therefore doesn't fit inside a heap page. Variable-length fields of types such as `text`, `varchar`, and `char` can have their values stored out of line in the table's `TOAST` table when the values are large enough to require it. Only an 18-byte pointer must remain inside the tuple in the table's heap. For shorter length variable-length fields, either a 4-byte or 1-byte field header is used, and the value is stored inside the heap tuple.

    -   Columns that were dropped from the table also contribute to the maximum column limit. Moreover, although the dropped column values for newly created tuples are internally marked as null in the tuple's null bitmap, the null bitmap also occupies space.
