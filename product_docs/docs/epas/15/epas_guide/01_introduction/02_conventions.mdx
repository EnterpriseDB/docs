Some of this information might apply interchangeably to the PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server database systems. The term *EDB Postgres Advanced Server* is used to refer to EDB Postgres Advanced Server. The term *Postgres* is used to generically refer to both PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server. When a distinction needs to be made between these two database systems, the specific names&mdash;PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server&mdash;are used.

The installation directory path of the PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server products is referred to as *POSTGRES_INSTALL_HOME*.
