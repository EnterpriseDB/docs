We package and support a number of open source components to manage your connections to your EDB Postgres Advanced Server database server. These EDB components are enhanced versions of the corresponding PostgreSQL components and are intended to support additional EDB Postgres Advanced Server capabilities.  

The EDB components for managing your database connections include:

- [EDB PgBouncer](/pgbouncer/latest/) &mdash; a lightweight connection pooling utility for Postgres installations

- [EDB Pgpool-II](/pgpool/latest/) &mdash; acts as middleware between client applications and a Postgres database server
