We package and support a number of open source components to connect your Postgres database server to external data sources. These EDB components are enhanced versions of the corresponding PostgreSQL components and are intended to support additional EDB Postgres Advanced Server capabilities. 

The EDB components to connect external data sources include:

  - [EDB Hadoop Foreign Data Wrapper](/hadoop_data_adapter/latest/) &mdash;  accesses data that resides on a Hadoop file system from a Postgres database server

  - [MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper](/mongo_data_adapter/latest/) &mdash;  accesses data that resides on a MongoDB database from a Postgres database server

  - [MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper](/mysql_data_adapter/latest/) &mdash;  accesses data that resides on a MySQL database from a Postgres database server
