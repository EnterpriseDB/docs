**Parameter type:** Integer

**Default value:** 16MB

**Range:** 1024kB to 2097151kB

**Minimum scope of effect:** Per session

**When value changes take effect:** Immediate

**Required authorization to activate:** Session user

Specifies the maximum amount of memory used by maintenance operations such as `VACUUM`, `CREATE INDEX`, and `ALTER TABLE ADD FOREIGN KEY`. It defaults to 16MB. Since a database session can execute only one of these operations at a time, and an installation normally doesn't have many of them running concurrently, it's safe to set this value significantly larger than `work_mem`. Larger settings might improve performance for vacuuming and for restoring database dumps.

When autovacuum runs, you can allocate up to `autovacuum_max_workers` times, so be careful not to set the default value too high.

A good rule of thumb is to set this to about 5% of system memory but not more than about 512MB. Larger values don't necessarily improve performance.
