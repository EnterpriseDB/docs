Specifies the target of checkpoint completion as a fraction of total time between checkpoints. This parameter spreads out the checkpoint writes while the system starts working toward the next checkpoint.

The default of 0.5 aims to finish the checkpoint writes when 50% of the next checkpoint is ready. A value of 0.9 aims to finish the checkpoint writes when 90% of the next checkpoint is done. This value throttles the checkpoint writes over a larger amount of time and avoids spikes of performance bottlenecking.
