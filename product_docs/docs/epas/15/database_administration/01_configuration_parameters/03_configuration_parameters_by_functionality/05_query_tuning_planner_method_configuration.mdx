**Required authorization to activate:** Session user

Allows the query planner to *early prune* partitioned tables. Early pruning means that the query planner can "prune" (that is, ignore) partitions that aren't searched in a query before generating query plans. This setting helps improve performance because it prevents generating query plans of partitions that aren't searched.

Conversely, *late pruning* means that the query planner prunes partitions after generating query plans for each partition. The `constraint_exclusion` configuration parameter controls late pruning.

The ability to early prune depends on the nature of the query in the `WHERE` clause. You can use early pruning in only simple queries with constraints like `WHERE column = literal`, for example, `WHERE deptno = 10`.

Don't use early pruning for more complex queries such as `WHERE column = expression`, for example, `WHERE deptno = 10 + 5`.

This parameter is deprecated from version 15 and later. Use `enable_partition_pruning` instead.
