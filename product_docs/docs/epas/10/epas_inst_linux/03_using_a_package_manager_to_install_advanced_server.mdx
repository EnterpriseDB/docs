You can use the `dnf` or `yum` package manager to install Advanced Server or Advanced Server supporting components. `dnf` or `yum` will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but requires access to the Advanced Server repositories. If your system does not have access to a repository via the Internet, you can use RPM to install an individual package or create a local repository, but you may be required to manually satisfy package dependencies.

You must have credentials for the EnterpriseDB repository to install Advanced Server; to submit a request for credentials, visit:

<https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf>

For a list of the RPM installers and Debian packages available from EnterpriseDB for Advanced Server and supporting components, see [Advanced Server RPM Packages](#advanced-server-rpm-packages).

Installing the server package creates a database superuser named `enterprisedb`. The user is assigned a user ID (UID) and a group ID (GID) of `26`. The user has no default password; use the `passwd` command to assign a password for the user. The default shell for the user is `bash`, and the user's home directory is `/var/lib/edb/as10`.

By default, Advanced Server logging is configured to write files to the `log` subdirectory of the `data` directory, rotating the files each day and retaining one week of log entries. You can customize the logging behavior of the server by modifying the `postgresql.conf` file. For more information about `Modifying the postgresql.conf File`, see the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server Guide* available at:

https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs

The RPM installers place Advanced Server components in the directories listed in the table below:

## Installation Pre-requisites

Before using an RPM package to install Advanced Server on a Linux host, you must:

**Install Linux-specific Software**

You must install `xterm, konsole`, or `gnome-terminal` before executing any console-based program installed by EnterpriseDB installers.

**Install Migration Toolkit or EDB\*Plus Installation Prerequisites (Optional)**

Before using an RPM to install Migration Toolkit or EDB\*Plus, you must first install Java version 1.7 or later for Migration Toolkit and Java version 1.8 or later for EDB\*Plus. On a Linux system, you can use the `dnf` or `yum` package manager to install Java. Open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    # yum -y install java
    ```

-   On RHEL or CentOS 8:

    ```text
    # dnf -y install java
    ```

Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation.

**Request Credentials to the EnterpriseDB Repository**

Before installing the repository configuration file, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/user/login>

After receiving your repository credentials you can:

-   Create the repository configuration file.
-   Modify the file, providing your user name and password.
-   Install Advanced Server.

### Installing Advanced Server on a CentOS Host

You can use an RPM package to install Advanced Server on a CentOS host.

-   To install the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke one of the following platform specific commands:

    On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

    On CentOS 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

-   Replace the `USERNAME:PASSWORD` variable in the following command with the username and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user:

    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

-   Before installing Advanced Server, you must install the `epel-release` package:

    On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    # yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

    On CentOS 8:

    ```text
    # dnf -y install epel-release
    ```

-   For CentOS 8, enable the PowerTools repository to satisfy package dependencies:

    ```text
    dnf config-manager --set-enabled PowerTools
    ```

    On CentOS 8, disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:

    ```text
    dnf -qy module disable postgresql
    ```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d.` 

After saving your changes to the configuration file, you can use `yum install` or `dnf install` command to install Advanced Server. For example, to install the server and its core components, use the command:

-   On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as10-server
    ```

-   On CentOS 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install edb-as10-server
    ```

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, `yum` may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter a `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

After installing Advanced Server, you must configure the installation. For more information, see [Configuring a Package Installation](#configuring-a-package-installation).

!!! Note
    During the installation, `yum` may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

### Installing Advanced Server on a RHEL Host

You can use an RPM package to install Advanced Server on a RHEL host (RHEL 8, 8.3 and onwards). 

-   To install the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke one of the following platform specific commands:

    On RHEL 7:

### Updating an RPM Installation

If you have an existing Advanced Server RPM installation, you can use `yum` or `dnf` to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the `edb.repo` file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum upgrade edb-repo
    ```

-   On RHEL or CentOS 8:

    ```text
    dnf upgrade edb-repo
    ```

`yum` or `dnf` will update the `edb.repo` file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your `edb.repo` file. Then, you can use `yum` or `dnf` to upgrade all packages whose names include the expression `edb`:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum upgrade edb*
    ```

-   On RHEL or CentOS 8:

    ```text
    dnf upgrade edb*
    ```

!!! Note
    The `yum upgrade` or `dnf upgrade` command will only perform an update between minor releases; to update between major releases, you must use `pg_upgrade`.

For more information about using yum commands and options, enter `yum --help` on your command line.

For more information about using `dnf` commands and options, visit:

<https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/quick-docs/dnf/>


## Installing Advanced Server on a SLES Host

You must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository to install Advanced Server on a SLES host. To request credentials for the repository, visit:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request>

You can use the zypper package manager to install Advanced Server or Advanced Server supporting components on an SLES host. zypper will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but some components require access to specific repositories that are not hosted at EnterpriseDB.

To add Advanced Server or supporting components, use the following commands to add EnterpriseDB repository configuration files to your SLES host:

 ```text
 zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas10-sles.repo
 zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas-sles-tools.repo
 zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/epas-sles-dependencies.repo
 ```

Each command creates a repository configuration file in the `/etc/zypp/repos.d` directory. The files are named:

- `edbas10suse.repo`
- `edbasdependencies.repo`
- `edbastools.repo`

After creating the repository configuration files, use the `zypper refresh` command to refresh the metadata on your SLES host to include the EnterpriseDB repositories.

 ```text
 /etc/zypp/repos.d # zypper refresh
 ```

When prompted for a `User Name` and `Password`, provide your connection credentials for the EnterpriseDB repository. If you need credentials, contact EnterpriseDB at:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/general-inquiry-form>

**Before installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server or supporting components, you must:**

-  Install the SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories using the following command:

   ```text
   zypper install SUSEConnect
   ```

-  Add SUSE Package Hub extension and sle-sdk extension to the SLES host using the following commands:

   ```text
   SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12/x86_64
   SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12/x86_64
   ```

For detailed information about registering a SUSE host, visit:

<https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=7016626>

To add Advanced Server, use the following command to add EnterpriseDB repository configuration files to your SLES host:

```text
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo
```

A repository configuration file is created named `edb.repo` in the `/etc/zypp/repos.d` directory.

After creating the repository configuration files, use the `zypper refresh` command to refresh the metadata on your SLES host to include the EnterpriseDB repositories.

To install Advanced Server:

```text
zypper -n install edb-as10-server
```

The following sections provide information about the specific repositories that are not hosted by EnterpriseDB, but that provide software that satisfies dependencies for each listed component. Please note that after adding repository access, you should use the `zypper refresh` command to process the repository content.

**Java Components:**

Please note that only OpenJDK (version 1.8) is supported on SLES hosts of Java components. Before using an RPM package to add Advanced Server or a supporting component that requires Java, use zypper to add supporting repository locations to your system. Use the commands:

```text
zypper addrepo http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/Java:/Factory/SLE_12_SP2/Java:Factory.repo
zypper refresh
```

Then, to install the server and its core components, invoke the command:

```text
zypper install edb-as10
```

**Slony:**

If you are using a package to add Slony to a SLES host, please note that you must add access to the Perl repository:

For SLES 12 SP2:

## Uninstalling Advanced Server on a SLES Host:

To uninstall Advanced Server, assume the identity of a root user and invoke the following command:

```text
zypper remove edb-as10-server
```

## Installing Advanced Server on a Debian or Ubuntu Host

To install Advanced Server on a Debian or Ubuntu host, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, visit:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request>

The following steps will walk you through using the EnterpriseDB apt repository to install a debian package. When using the commands, replace the `username` and `password` with the credentials provided by EnterpriseDB.

-   Assume superuser privileges:

    ```text
    sudo su –
    ```

-   Configure the EnterpriseDB repository and replace the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` variable in the following command:

    On Debian 9:

    ```text
    sudo su -c 'echo "deb https://USERNAME:PASSWORD@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
    ```

    On Ubuntu 18:

    a.  Set up the EnterpriseDB repository:

    ```text
    sudo su -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
    ```

    b.  Substitute your EnterpriseDB credentials for the `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` variable in the following command:

    ```text
    sudo su -c 'echo "machine apt.enterprisedb.com login <USERNAME> password <PASSWORD>" > /etc/apt/auth.conf.d/edb.conf'
    ```

-   Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

    ```text
    apt-get -y install apt-transport-https
    ```

-   Add the EDB signing key:

    ```text
    wget -q -O - https://apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key  | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

-   Update the repository metadata:

    ```text
    apt-get update
    ```

-   Install Debian package:

    ```text
    apt-get –y install edb-as10-server
    ```

!!! Note
     The OpenJDK version 10 is supported on a Debian or Ubuntu host of Java components. Before using a debian package to add Advanced Server or a supporting component such as MTK or EDB\*Plus that requires Java, make sure to install Java version 8 on your system to support EDB Java-based components.

The Debian package manager places Advanced Server and supporting components in the directories listed in the following table:

| Component                        | Location                                                                                |

## Configuring a Package Installation

The packages that install the database server component create a unit file (on version 7.x or 8.x hosts) and service startup scripts.

### Creating a Database Cluster and Starting the Service

The PostgreSQL `initdb` command creates a database cluster. After installing Advanced Server, you must manually configure the service and invoke `initdb` to create your cluster. When invoking `initdb`, you can:

-   Specify environment options on the command line.
-   Include the `systemd` service manager on RHEL or CentOS 7.x | 8.x and use a service configuration file to configure the environment.

To review the `initdb` documentation, visit:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/app-initdb.html>

After specifying any options in the service configuration file, you can create the database cluster and start the service; these steps are platform specific.

**On RHEL or CentOS 7.x | 8.x**

To invoke `initdb` on a RHEL or CentOS 7.x | 8.x system, with the options specified in the service configuration file, assume the identity of the operating system superuser:

```text
su - root
```

To initialize a cluster with the non-default values, you can use the `PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS` environment variable by invoking the `edb-as-10-setup` cluster initialization script that resides under `EPAS_Home/bin`.

To invoke `initdb` export the `PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS` environment variable with the following command:

```text
PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS="-E UTF-8" /usr/edb/as10/bin/edb-as-10-setup initdb
```

After creating the cluster, use `systemctl` to start, stop, or restart the service:

```text
systemctl { start | stop | restart } edb-as-10
```

**On Debian 9.x or Ubuntu 18.04**

You can initialize multiple clusters using the bundled scripts. To create a new cluster, assume `root` privileges, and invoke the bundled script:

```text
/usr/bin/epas_createcluster 10 main2
```

To start a new cluster, use the following command:

```text
/usr/bin/epas_ctlcluster 10 main2 start  
```

To list all the available clusters, use the following command:

```text
/usr/bin/epas_lsclusters
```

!!! Note
    The data directory is created under `/var/lib/edb-as/10/main2` and configuration directory is created under `/etc/edb-as/10/main/`.

<div id="specifying_cluster_options_with_initdbopts" class="registered_link"></div>

#### Specifying Cluster Options with INITDBOPTS

You can use the `INITDBOPTS` variable to specify your cluster configuration preferences. By default, the `INITDBOPTS` variable is commented out in the service configuration file; unless modified, when you run the service startup script, the new cluster will be created in a mode compatible with Oracle databases. Clusters created in this mode will contain a database named `edb`, and have a database superuser named `enterprisedb`.

To create a new cluster in PostgreSQL mode, remove the pound sign (#) in front of the `INITDBOPTS` variable, enabling the `"---no-redwood-compat"-` option. Clusters created in PostgreSQL mode will contain a database named `postgres`, and have a database superuser named `postgres`.

You may also specify multiple `initdb` options. For example, the following statement:

```text
INITDBOPTS="--no-redwood-compat -U alice --locale=en_US.UTF-8"
```

Creates a database cluster (without compatibility features for Oracle) that contains a database named `postgres` that is owned by a user named `alice`; the cluster uses `UTF-8` encoding.

In addition to the cluster configuration options documented in the PostgreSQL core documentation, Advanced Server supports the following `initdb` options:

`--no-redwood-compat`

 Include the `--no-redwood-compat` keywords to instruct the server to create the cluster in PostgreSQL mode. When the cluster is created in PostgreSQL mode, the name of the database superuser will be `postgres`, the name of the default database will be `postgres`, and Advanced Server’s features compatible with Oracle databases will not be available to the cluster.

`--redwood-like`

 Include the `--redwood-like` keywords to instruct the server to use an escape character (an empty string ('')) following the `LIKE` (or PostgreSQL-compatible `ILIKE`) operator in a SQL statement that is compatible with Oracle syntax.

`--icu-short-form`

 Include the `--icu-short-form` keywords to create a cluster that uses a default ICU (International Components for Unicode) collation for all databases in the cluster. For more information about Unicode collations, refer to the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server Guide* available at:

[https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs](/epas/latest/)

For more information about using `initdb`, and the available cluster configuration options, see the PostgreSQL Core Documentation available at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/app-initdb.html>

You can also view online help for `initdb` by assuming superuser privileges and entering:

```text
/path_to_initdb_installation_directory/initdb --help
```

Where `path_to_initdb_installation_directory` specifies the location of the `initdb` binary file.

### Modifying the Data Directory Location on CentOS or Redhat 7.x | 8.x

On a CentOS or RedHat version 7.x | 8.x host, the unit file is named `edb-as-10.service` and resides in `/usr/lib/systemd/system`. The unit file contains references to the location of the Advanced Server `data` directory. You should avoid making any modifications directly to the unit file because it may be overwritten during package upgrades.

By default, data files reside under `/var/lib/edb/as10/data` directory. To use a data directory that resides in a non-default location, perform the following steps:

-   Create a copy of the unit file under the `/etc` directory:

    ```text
    cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-10.service /etc/systemd/system/
    ```

-   After copying the unit file to the new location, modify the service file `/etc/systemd/system/edb-as-10.service` with your editor of choice, correcting any required paths.

-   Use the following command to reload `systemd`, updating the modified service scripts:

    ```text
    systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

-   Start the Advanced Server service with the following command:

    ```text
    systemctl start edb-as-10
    ```

## Starting Multiple Postmasters with Different Clusters

You can configure Advanced Server to use multiple postmasters, each with its own database cluster. The steps required are version specific to the Linux host.

**On RHEL or CentOS 7.x | 8.x**

The `edb-as10-server-core` RPM for version 7.x | 8.x contains a unit file that starts the Advanced Server instance. The file allows you to start multiple services, with unique `data` directories and that monitor different ports. You must have `root` access to invoke or modify the script.

The example that follows creates an Advanced Server installation with two instances; the secondary instance is named `secondary`:

-   Make a copy of the default file with the new name. As noted at the top of the file, all modifications must reside under `/etc`. You must pick a name that is not already used in `/etc/systemd/system`.

    ```text
    cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-10.service /etc/systemd/system/secondary-edb-as-10.service
    ```

-   Edit the file, changing `PGDATA` to point to the new `data` directory that you will create the cluster against.

-   Create the target `PGDATA` with user `enterprisedb`.

-   Run `initdb`, specifying the setup script:

    ```text
    /usr/edb/as10/bin/edb-as-10-setup initdb secondary-edb-as-10
    ```

-   Edit the `postgresql.conf` file for the new instance, specifying the port, the IP address, TCP/IP settings, etc.

-   Make sure that new cluster runs after a reboot:

    ```text
    systemctl enable secondary-edb-as-10
    ```

-   Start the second cluster with the following command:

    ```text
    systemctl start secondary-edb-as-10
    ```

## Creating an Advanced Server Repository on an Isolated Network

You can create a local repository to act as a host for the Advanced Server RPM packages if the server on which you wish to install Advanced Server (or supporting components) cannot directly access the EnterpriseDB repository. Please note that this is a high-level listing of the steps requires; you will need to modify the process for your individual network.

To create and use a local repository, you must:

-   Use `yum` or `dnf` to install the `epel-release`, `yum-utils`, and `createrepo` packages.

    On RHEL or CentOS 7.x:

    ```bash
    yum install epel-release
    yum install yum-utils
    yum install createrepo
    ```

    On RHEL or CentOS 8.x:

    ```bash
    dnf install epel-release
    dnf install yum-utils
    dnf install createrepo
    ```

-   Create a directory in which to store the repository:

    ```text
    mkdir /srv/repos
    ```

-   Copy the RPM installation packages to your local repository. You can download the individual packages or use a tarball to populate the repository. The packages are available from the EnterpriseDB repository at <https://repos.enterprisedb.com/>.

-   Sync the RPM packages and create the repository.

    ```text
    reposync -r edbas10-p /srv/repos
    createrepo /srv/repos
    ```

-   Install your preferred webserver on the host that will act as your local repository, and ensure that the repository directory is accessible to the other servers on your network.

-   On each isolated database server, configure `yum` or `dnf` to pull updates from the mirrored repository on your local network. For example, you might create a repository configuration file called `/etc/yum.repos.d/edb-repo` with connection information that specifies:

    ```text
    [edbas10]
    name=EnterpriseDB Advanced Server 10
    baseurl=https://yum.your_domain.com/edbas10
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0
    ```

After specifying the location and connection information for your local repository, you can use `yum` or `dnf` commands to install Advanced Server and its supporting components on the isolated servers. For example:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as10-server
    ```

-   On RHEL or CentOS 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install edb-as10-server
    ```
