You can use the `yum` package manager to install Advanced Server or Advanced Server supporting components. `yum` will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but requires access to the Advanced Server repositories. If your system does not have access to a repository via the Internet, you can use RPM to install an individual package or create a local repository, but you may be required to manually satisfy package dependencies.

For a list of the RPM installers available from EnterpriseDB for Advanced Server and supporting components, see [Advanced Server RPM Packages](#advanced-server-rpm-packages).

Installing the server package creates a database superuser named `enterprisedb`. The user is assigned a user ID (UID) and a group ID (GID) of `26`. The user has no default password; use the `passwd` command to assign a password for the user. The default shell for the user is `bash`, and the user's home directory is `/var/lib/edb/as10`.

By default, Advanced Server logging is configured to write files to the `log` subdirectory of the `data` directory, rotating the files each day and retaining one week of log entries. You can customize the logging behavior of the server by modifying the `postgresql.conf` file. For more information about `Modifying the postgresql.conf File`, see the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server Guide* available at:

https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs

The RPM installers place Advanced Server components in the directories listed in the table below:

| Component                         | Location                                   |

## Installation Pre-requisites

Before using an RPM package to install Advanced Server on a Linux host, you must:

**Linux-specific Software Requirements**

You must install `xterm`, `konsole`, or `gnome-terminal` before executing any console-based program installed by the Advanced Server installer. Without a console program, you will not be able to access Advanced Server configuration files through menu selections.

Before invoking the StackBuilder Plus utility, you must install the `redhat-lsb` package. To install the package, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

```text
yum install redhat-lsb
```

**Install Migration Toolkit or EDB\*Plus Installation Prerequisites**

On a Linux system, you can use the `yum` package manager to install Java. Open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

```text
yum install java
```

Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation.

**SELinux Permissions**

Before invoking the installer on a system that is running SELinux, you must set SELinux to `permissive` mode. 

The following example works on Redhat Enterprise Linux, Fedora Core or CentOS distributions. Use comparable commands that are compatible with your Linux distribution to set SELinux to `permissive` mode during installation and return it to `enforcing` mode when installation is complete.

Before installing Advanced Server, set SELinux to `permissive` mode with the command:

```text
setenforce Permissive
```

When the installation is complete, return SELinux to `enforcing` mode with the command:

```text
setenforce Enforcing
```

**Request Credentials to the EnterpriseDB Repository**

Before installing the repository configuration file, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/user/login>

After receiving your repository credentials you can:

-   Create the repository configuration file.
-   Modify the file, providing your user name and password.
-   Install Advanced Server.

## Graphical Installation Prerequisites

**User Privileges**

Before invoking the installer on a Linux system, you must have superuser privileges to perform an Advanced Server installation.  

### Installing Advanced Server on a CentOS Host

You can use an RPM package to install Advanced Server on a CentOS host.

-   To install the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following platform specific command:

    On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

-   Replace the `USERNAME:PASSWORD` variable in the following command with the username and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user:

    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

-   Before installing Advanced Server, you must install the `epel-release` package:

    On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d.` 

After saving your changes to the configuration file, you can use `yum install` command to install Advanced Server. For example, to install the server and its core components, use the command:

-   On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as10-server
    ```

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, `yum` may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter a `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

After installing Advanced Server, you must configure the installation. For more information, see [Configuring a Package Installation](#configuring-a-package-installation).

### Updating an RPM Installation

If you have an existing Advanced Server RPM installation, you can use `yum` to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the `edb.repo` file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum upgrade edb-repo
    ```

`yum` will update the `edb.repo` file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your `edb.repo` file. Then, you can use `yum` to upgrade all packages whose names include the expression `edb`:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum upgrade edb*
    ```

!!! Note
    The `yum upgrade` command will only perform an update between minor releases; to update between major releases, you must use `pg_upgrade`.

<div id="configuring_a_package_installation" class="registered_link"></div>

## Configuring a Package Installation

The packages that install the database server component create a unit file on version 7.x host and service startup scripts.

The PostgreSQL `initdb` command creates a database cluster. After installing Advanced Server, you must manually configure the service and invoke `initdb` to create your cluster. When invoking `initdb`, you can:

-   Specify environment options on the command line.
-   Include the `systemd` service manager on RHEL or CentOS 7.x and use a service configuration file to configure the environment.

### Creating a Database Cluster and Starting the Service

After specifying any options in the service configuration file, you can create the database cluster and start the service; these steps are platform specific.

**On RHEL or CentOS 7.x**

To invoke `initdb` on a RHEL or CentOS 7.x system, with the options specified in the service configuration file, assume the identity of the operating system superuser:

```text
su - root
```

Then, invoke `initdb`:

```text
/usr/edb/as10/bin/edb-as-10-setup initdb
```

After creating the cluster, use `systemctl` to start, stop, or restart the service:

```text
systemctl { start | stop | restart } edb-as-10
```

<div id="specifying_cluster_options_with_initdbopts" class="registered_link"></div>

#### Specifying Cluster Options with INITDBOPTS

You can use the `INITDBOPTS` variable to specify your cluster configuration preferences. By default, the `INITDBOPTS` variable is commented out in the service configuration file; unless modified, when you run the service startup script, the new cluster will be created in a mode compatible with Oracle databases. Clusters created in this mode will contain a database named `edb`, and have a database superuser named `enterprisedb`.

To create a new cluster in PostgreSQL mode, remove the pound sign (#) in front of the `INITDBOPTS` variable, enabling the `"---no-redwood-compat"-` option. Clusters created in PostgreSQL mode will contain a database named `postgres`, and have a database superuser named `postgres`.

You may also specify multiple `initdb` options. For example, the following statement:

```text
INITDBOPTS="--no-redwood-compat -U alice --locale=en_US.UTF-8"
```

Creates a database cluster (without compatibility features for Oracle) that contains a database named `postgres` that is owned by a user named `alice`; the cluster uses `UTF-8` encoding.

In addition to the cluster configuration options documented in the PostgreSQL core documentation, Advanced Server supports the following `initdb` options:

`--no-redwood-compat`

 Include the `--no-redwood-compat` keywords to instruct the server to create the cluster in PostgreSQL mode. When the cluster is created in PostgreSQL mode, the name of the database superuser will be `postgres`, the name of the default database will be `postgres`, and Advanced Server’s features compatible with Oracle databases will not be available to the cluster.

`--redwood-like`

 Include the `--redwood-like` keywords to instruct the server to use an escape character (an empty string ('')) following the `LIKE` (or PostgreSQL-compatible `ILIKE`) operator in a SQL statement that is compatible with Oracle syntax.

`--icu-short-form`

 Include the `--icu-short-form` keywords to create a cluster that uses a default ICU (International Components for Unicode) collation for all databases in the cluster. For more information about Unicode collations, refer to the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server Guide* available at:

[https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs](/epas/10/)

For more information about using `initdb`, and the available cluster configuration options, see the PostgreSQL Core Documentation available at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/app-initdb.html>

You can also view online help for `initdb` by assuming superuser privileges and entering:

```text
/path_to_initdb_installation_directory/initdb --help
```

Where `path_to_initdb_installation_directory` specifies the location of the `initdb` binary file.

### Modifying the Data Directory Location on CentOS or Redhat 7.x 

On a CentOS or RedHat version 7.x host, the unit file is named `edb-as-10.service` and resides in `/usr/lib/systemd/system`. The unit file contains references to the location of the Advanced Server `data` directory. You should avoid making any modifications directly to the unit file because it may be overwritten during package upgrades.

By default, data files reside under `/var/lib/edb/as10/data` directory. To use a data directory that resides in a non-default location, perform the following steps:

-   Create a copy of the unit file under the `/etc` directory:

    ```text
    cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-10.service /etc/systemd/system/
    ```

-   After copying the unit file to the new location, modify the service file `/etc/systemd/system/edb-as-10.service` with your editor of choice, correcting any required paths.

-   Use the following command to reload `systemd`, updating the modified service scripts:

    ```text
    systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

-   Start the Advanced Server service with the following command:

    ```text
    systemctl start edb-as-10
    ```

## Starting Multiple Postmasters with Different Clusters

You can configure Advanced Server to use multiple postmasters, each with its own database cluster. The steps required are version specific to the Linux host.

**On RHEL or CentOS 7.x**

The `edb-as10-server-core` RPM for version 7.x contains a unit file that starts the Advanced Server instance. The file allows you to start multiple services, with unique `data` directories and that monitor different ports. You must have `root` access to invoke or modify the script.

The example that follows creates an Advanced Server installation with two instances; the secondary instance is named `secondary`:

-   Make a copy of the default file with the new name. As noted at the top of the file, all modifications must reside under `/etc`. You must pick a name that is not already used in `/etc/systemd/system`.

    ```text
    cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-10.service /etc/systemd/system/secondary-edb-as-10.service
    ```

-   Edit the file, changing `PGDATA` to point to the new `data` directory that you will create the cluster against.

-   Create the target `PGDATA` with user `enterprisedb`.

-   Run `initdb`, specifying the setup script:

    ```text
    /usr/edb/as10/bin/edb-as-10-setup initdb secondary-edb-as-10
    ```

-   Edit the `postgresql.conf` file for the new instance, specifying the port, the IP address, TCP/IP settings, etc.

-   Make sure that new cluster runs after a reboot:

    ```text
    systemctl enable secondary-edb-as-10
    ```

-   Start the second cluster with the following command:

    ```text
    systemctl start secondary-edb-as-10
    ```

## Creating an Advanced Server Repository on an Isolated Network

You can create a local repository to act as a host for the Advanced Server RPM packages if the server on which you wish to install Advanced Server (or supporting components) cannot directly access the EnterpriseDB repository. Please note that this is a high-level listing of the steps requires; you will need to modify the process for your individual network.

To create and use a local repository, you must:

-   Use `yum` to install the `epel-release`, `yum-utils`, and `createrepo` packages.

    On RHEL or CentOS 7.x:

    ```bash
    yum install epel-release
    yum install yum-utils
    yum install createrepo
    ```

-   Create a directory in which to store the repository:

    ```text
    mkdir /srv/repos
    ```

-   Copy the RPM installation packages to your local repository. You can download the individual packages or use a tarball to populate the repository. The packages are available from the EnterpriseDB repository at <https://repos.enterprisedb.com/>.

-   Sync the RPM packages and create the repository.

    ```text
    reposync -r edbas10 -p /srv/repos
    createrepo /srv/repos
    ```

-   Install your preferred webserver on the host that will act as your local repository, and ensure that the repository directory is accessible to the other servers on your network. For example, you might install `lighttpd`:

    ```text
    yum install lighttpd
    ```

-   If you are using `lighttpd`, you must provide a configuration file that identifies the location of the repository on your local network. For example, the configuration file might contain:

    ```text
    $HTTP["host"] == "yum.domain.com"{
      server.document-root = "/srv/repos"
      server.errorlog="/var/log/lighttpd/yum_error.log"
      accesslog.filename ="/var/log/lighttpd/yum_access.log"}
    ```  

    For detailed information about installing, configuring and using `lighttpd`, visit the official project site at <http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/1/wiki/Docs>.

-   On each isolated database server, configure `yum` to pull updates from the mirrored repository on your local network. For example, you might create a repository configuration file called `/etc/yum.repos.d/edb-repo` with connection information that specifies:

    ```text
    [edbas10]
    name=EnterpriseDB Advanced Server 10
    baseurl=https://yum.domain.com/edbas10
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0
    ```

After specifying the location and connection information for your local repository, you can use `yum` command to install Advanced Server and its supporting components on the isolated servers. For example:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as10-server
    ```

<https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/CreateLocalRepos>


## Using the Graphical Installer on a Linux System

During the installation, the graphical installer copies a number of temporary files to the `/tmp` directory on Linux. If invoking the installer from the command line, you can set the value of the variable on the command line by using the following command:

```text
export TEMP=temp_file_location
```

Where `temp_file_location` specifies the alternate location for the temporary files. 

!!! Note
    If you are invoking the installer to perform a system upgrade, the installer will preserve the configuration options specified during the previous installation.

**Setting Cluster Preferences during a Graphical Installation**

During an installation, the graphical installer invokes the PostgreSQL `initdb` utility to initialize a cluster. If you are using the graphical installer, you can use the `INITDBOPTS` environment variable to specify your `initdb` preferences. Before invoking the graphical installer, set the value of `INITDBOPTS` at the command line, specifying one or more cluster options. For example, on Linux use an `export` statement to set the value:

```text
export INITDBOPTS="-k -E=UTF-8" 
```

On Linux, enclose the options in double-quotes ("). 

### Performing a Graphical Installation

A graphical installation wizard provides a quick and easy way to install Advanced Server. As the `Setup` wizard’s easy-to-follow dialogs lead you through the installation process, specify information about your system, your system usage, and the modules that will best complement your installation of Advanced Server. When you have completed the dialogs, the installer performs an installation based on the selections made during the setup process.

When the Advanced Server installation finishes, you will be offered the option to invoke EDB Postgres StackBuilder Plus. StackBuilder Plus provides an easy-to-use graphical interface that can update installed products, or download and add any omitted modules (and the resulting dependencies) after your Advanced Server setup and installation completes.
