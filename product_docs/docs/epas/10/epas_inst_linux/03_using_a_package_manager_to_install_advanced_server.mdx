You can use the `yum` package manager to install Advanced Server or Advanced Server supporting components. `yum` will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but requires access to the Advanced Server repositories. If your system does not have access to a repository via the Internet, you can use RPM to install an individual package or create a local repository, but you may be required to manually satisfy package dependencies.

For a list of the RPM installers available from EnterpriseDB for Advanced Server and supporting components, see [Advanced Server RPM Packages](#advanced-server-rpm-packages).

Installing the server package creates a database superuser named `enterprisedb`. The user is assigned a user ID (UID) and a group ID (GID) of `26`. The user has no default password; use the `passwd` command to assign a password for the user. The default shell for the user is `bash`, and the user's home directory is `/var/lib/edb/as10`.

By default, Advanced Server logging is configured to write files to the `log` subdirectory of the `data` directory, rotating the files each day and retaining one week of log entries. You can customize the logging behavior of the server by modifying the `postgresql.conf` file. For more information about `Modifying the postgresql.conf File`, see the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server Guide* available at:

https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs

The RPM installers place Advanced Server components in the directories listed in the table below:

| Component                         | Location                                   |

## Installation Pre-requisites

Before using an RPM package to install Advanced Server on a Linux host, you must:

**Install Linux-specific Software Requirements**

You must install `xterm`, `konsole`, or `gnome-terminal` before executing any console-based program installed by the Advanced Server installer. Without a console program, you will not be able to access Advanced Server configuration files through menu selections.

Before invoking the StackBuilder Plus utility, you must install the `redhat-lsb` package. To install the package, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

```text
yum install redhat-lsb
```

**Migration Toolkit or EDB\*Plus Installation Prerequisites**

On a Linux system, you can use the `yum` package manager to install Java. Open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter:

```text
yum install java
```

Follow the onscreen instructions to complete the installation.

**SELinux Permissions**

Before invoking the installer on a system that is running SELinux, you must set SELinux to `permissive` mode. 

The following example works on Redhat Enterprise Linux, Fedora Core or CentOS distributions. Use comparable commands that are compatible with your Linux distribution to set SELinux to `permissive` mode during installation and return it to `enforcing` mode when installation is complete.

Before installing Advanced Server, set SELinux to `permissive` mode with the command:

```text
setenforce Permissive
```

When the installation is complete, return SELinux to `enforcing` mode with the command:

```text
setenforce Enforcing
```

**Request Credentials to the EnterpriseDB Repository**

Before installing the repository configuration file, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/user/login>

After receiving your repository credentials you can:

-   Create the repository configuration file.
-   Modify the file, providing your user name and password.
-   Install Advanced Server.

!!! Note
    Before invoking the installer on a Linux system, you must have superuser privileges to perform an Advanced Server installation.  

### Installing Advanced Server on a CentOS Host

You can use an RPM package to install Advanced Server on a CentOS host.

-   To install the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following platform specific command:

    On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

-   Replace the `USERNAME:PASSWORD` variable in the following command with the username and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user:

    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

-   Before installing Advanced Server, you must install the `epel-release` package:

    On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d.` 

After saving your changes to the configuration file, you can use `yum install` command to install Advanced Server. For example, to install the server and its core components, use the command:

-   On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as10-server
    ```

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, `yum` may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter a `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

After installing Advanced Server, you must configure the installation. For more information, see [Configuring a Package Installation](#configuring-a-package-installation).

!!! Note
    During the installation, `yum` may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

### Updating an RPM Installation

If you have an existing Advanced Server RPM installation, you can use `yum` to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the `edb.repo` file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum upgrade edb-repo
    ```

`yum` will update the `edb.repo` file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your `edb.repo` file. Then, you can use `yum` to upgrade all packages whose names include the expression `edb`:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum upgrade edb*
    ```

!!! Note
    The `yum upgrade` command will only perform an update between minor releases; to update between major releases, you must use `pg_upgrade`.

<div id="configuring_a_package_installation" class="registered_link"></div>

## Configuring a Package Installation

The packages that install the database server component create a unit file on version 7.x host and service startup scripts.

The PostgreSQL `initdb` command creates a database cluster. After installing Advanced Server, you must manually configure the service and invoke `initdb` to create your cluster. When invoking `initdb`, you can:

-   Specify environment options on the command line.
-   Include the `systemd` service manager on RHEL or CentOS 7.x and use a service configuration file to configure the environment.

### Creating a Database Cluster and Starting the Service

After specifying any options in the service configuration file, you can create the database cluster and start the service; these steps are platform specific.

**On RHEL or CentOS 7.x**

To invoke `initdb` on a RHEL or CentOS 7.x system, with the options specified in the service configuration file, assume the identity of the operating system superuser:

```text
su - root
```

Then, invoke `initdb`:

```text
/usr/edb/as10/bin/edb-as-10-setup initdb
```

After creating the cluster, use `systemctl` to start, stop, or restart the service:

```text
systemctl { start | stop | restart } edb-as-10
```

<div id="specifying_cluster_options_with_initdbopts" class="registered_link"></div>

#### Specifying Cluster Options with INITDBOPTS

You can use the `INITDBOPTS` variable to specify your cluster configuration preferences. By default, the `INITDBOPTS` variable is commented out in the service configuration file; unless modified, when you run the service startup script, the new cluster will be created in a mode compatible with Oracle databases. Clusters created in this mode will contain a database named `edb`, and have a database superuser named `enterprisedb`.

To create a new cluster in PostgreSQL mode, remove the pound sign (#) in front of the `INITDBOPTS` variable, enabling the `"---no-redwood-compat"-` option. Clusters created in PostgreSQL mode will contain a database named `postgres`, and have a database superuser named `postgres`.

You may also specify multiple `initdb` options. For example, the following statement:

```text
INITDBOPTS="--no-redwood-compat -U alice --locale=en_US.UTF-8"
```

Creates a database cluster (without compatibility features for Oracle) that contains a database named `postgres` that is owned by a user named `alice`; the cluster uses `UTF-8` encoding.

In addition to the cluster configuration options documented in the PostgreSQL core documentation, Advanced Server supports the following `initdb` options:

`--no-redwood-compat`

 Include the `--no-redwood-compat` keywords to instruct the server to create the cluster in PostgreSQL mode. When the cluster is created in PostgreSQL mode, the name of the database superuser will be `postgres`, the name of the default database will be `postgres`, and Advanced Server’s features compatible with Oracle databases will not be available to the cluster.

`--redwood-like`

 Include the `--redwood-like` keywords to instruct the server to use an escape character (an empty string ('')) following the `LIKE` (or PostgreSQL-compatible `ILIKE`) operator in a SQL statement that is compatible with Oracle syntax.

`--icu-short-form`

 Include the `--icu-short-form` keywords to create a cluster that uses a default ICU (International Components for Unicode) collation for all databases in the cluster. For more information about Unicode collations, refer to the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server Guide* available at:

[https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs](/epas/10/)

For more information about using `initdb`, and the available cluster configuration options, see the PostgreSQL Core Documentation available at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/app-initdb.html>

You can also view online help for `initdb` by assuming superuser privileges and entering:

```text
/path_to_initdb_installation_directory/initdb --help
```

Where `path_to_initdb_installation_directory` specifies the location of the `initdb` binary file.

### Modifying the Data Directory Location on CentOS or Redhat 7.x 

On a CentOS or RedHat version 7.x host, the unit file is named `edb-as-10.service` and resides in `/usr/lib/systemd/system`. The unit file contains references to the location of the Advanced Server `data` directory. You should avoid making any modifications directly to the unit file because it may be overwritten during package upgrades.

By default, data files reside under `/var/lib/edb/as10/data` directory. To use a data directory that resides in a non-default location, perform the following steps:

-   Create a copy of the unit file under the `/etc` directory:

    ```text
    cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-10.service /etc/systemd/system/
    ```

-   After copying the unit file to the new location, modify the service file `/etc/systemd/system/edb-as-10.service` with your editor of choice, correcting any required paths.

-   Use the following command to reload `systemd`, updating the modified service scripts:

    ```text
    systemctl daemon-reload
    ```

-   Start the Advanced Server service with the following command:

    ```text
    systemctl start edb-as-10
    ```

## Starting Multiple Postmasters with Different Clusters

You can configure Advanced Server to use multiple postmasters, each with its own database cluster. The steps required are version specific to the Linux host.

**On RHEL or CentOS 7.x**

The `edb-as10-server-core` RPM for version 7.x contains a unit file that starts the Advanced Server instance. The file allows you to start multiple services, with unique `data` directories and that monitor different ports. You must have `root` access to invoke or modify the script.

The example that follows creates an Advanced Server installation with two instances; the secondary instance is named `secondary`:

-   Make a copy of the default file with the new name. As noted at the top of the file, all modifications must reside under `/etc`. You must pick a name that is not already used in `/etc/systemd/system`.

    ```text
    cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-10.service /etc/systemd/system/secondary-edb-as-10.service
    ```

-   Edit the file, changing `PGDATA` to point to the new `data` directory that you will create the cluster against.

-   Create the target `PGDATA` with user `enterprisedb`.

-   Run `initdb`, specifying the setup script:

    ```text
    /usr/edb/as10/bin/edb-as-10-setup initdb secondary-edb-as-10
    ```

-   Edit the `postgresql.conf` file for the new instance, specifying the port, the IP address, TCP/IP settings, etc.

-   Make sure that new cluster runs after a reboot:

    ```text
    systemctl enable secondary-edb-as-10
    ```

-   Start the second cluster with the following command:

    ```text
    systemctl start secondary-edb-as-10
    ```

## Creating an Advanced Server Repository on an Isolated Network

You can create a local repository to act as a host for the Advanced Server RPM packages if the server on which you wish to install Advanced Server (or supporting components) cannot directly access the EnterpriseDB repository. Please note that this is a high-level listing of the steps requires; you will need to modify the process for your individual network.

To create and use a local repository, you must:

-   Use `yum` to install the `epel-release`, `yum-utils`, and `createrepo` packages.

    On RHEL or CentOS 7.x:

    ```bash
    yum install epel-release
    yum install yum-utils
    yum install createrepo
    ```

-   Create a directory in which to store the repository:

    ```text
    mkdir /srv/repos
    ```

-   Copy the RPM installation packages to your local repository. You can download the individual packages or use a tarball to populate the repository. The packages are available from the EnterpriseDB repository at <https://repos.enterprisedb.com/>.

-   Sync the RPM packages and create the repository.

    ```text
    reposync -r edbas10 -p /srv/repos
    createrepo /srv/repos
    ```

-   Install your preferred webserver on the host that will act as your local repository, and ensure that the repository directory is accessible to the other servers on your network. For example, you might install `lighttpd`:

    ```text
    yum install lighttpd
    ```

-   If you are using `lighttpd`, you must provide a configuration file that identifies the location of the repository on your local network. For example, the configuration file might contain:

    ```text
    $HTTP["host"] == "yum.domain.com"{
      server.document-root = "/srv/repos"
      server.errorlog="/var/log/lighttpd/yum_error.log"
      accesslog.filename ="/var/log/lighttpd/yum_access.log"}
    ```  

    For detailed information about installing, configuring and using `lighttpd`, visit the official project site at <http://redmine.lighttpd.net/projects/1/wiki/Docs>.

-   On each isolated database server, configure `yum` to pull updates from the mirrored repository on your local network. For example, you might create a repository configuration file called `/etc/yum.repos.d/edb-repo` with connection information that specifies:

    ```text
    [edbas10]
    name=EnterpriseDB Advanced Server 10
    baseurl=http://yum.domain.com/edbas10
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=0
    ```

After specifying the location and connection information for your local repository, you can use `yum` command to install Advanced Server and its supporting components on the isolated servers. For example:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as10-server
    ```

For more information about creating a local `yum` repository, visit:

<https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/CreateLocalRepos>


## Using the Graphical Installer on a Linux System

During the installation, the graphical installer copies a number of temporary files to the `/tmp` directory on Linux. If invoking the installer from the command line, you can set the value of the variable on the command line by using the following command:

```text
export TEMP=temp_file_location
```

Where `temp_file_location` specifies the alternate location for the temporary files. 

!!! Note
    If you are invoking the installer to perform a system upgrade, the installer will preserve the configuration options specified during the previous installation.

**Setting Cluster Preferences during a Graphical Installation**

During an installation, the graphical installer invokes the PostgreSQL `initdb` utility to initialize a cluster. If you are using the graphical installer, you can use the `INITDBOPTS` environment variable to specify your `initdb` preferences. Before invoking the graphical installer, set the value of `INITDBOPTS` at the command line, specifying one or more cluster options. For example, on Linux use an `export` statement to set the value:

```text
export INITDBOPTS="-k -E=UTF-8" 
```

On Linux, enclose the options in double-quotes ("). 

For more information about using `initdb` cluster configuration options, see the PostgreSQL Core Documentation available at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/app-initdb.html>

### Performing a Graphical Installation

A graphical installation wizard provides a quick and easy way to install Advanced Server. As the `Setup` wizard’s easy-to-follow dialogs lead you through the installation process, specify information about your system, your system usage, and the modules that will best complement your installation of Advanced Server. When you have completed the dialogs, the installer performs an installation based on the selections made during the setup process.

To use the graphical installation wizard, you must have superuser privileges. To invoke the `Setup` wizard, open a `Terminal` window, navigate to the directory that contains the Advanced Server installer, and enter the command:

```text
./edb-as10-server-10.x.x.x-linux-x64.run
```

When the `Language Selection` popup opens, select an installation language and click `OK` to continue to the `Setup` window.

See [Using StackBuilder Plus](#using-stackbuilder-plus) for more information about StackBuilder Plus.

**Command Line Tools**

The `Command Line Tools` option installs command line tools and supporting client libraries including:

-   libpq
-   psql
-   EDB\*Loader
-   ecpgPlus
-   pg_basebackup, pg_dump, and pg_restore
-   pg_bench and more.

!!! Note
    The `Command Line Tools` are required if you are installing Advanced Server or pgAdmin 4.

After selecting the components you wish to install, click `Next` to open the `Additional Directories` window.

![The Additional Directories window](images/additional_directories.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 6: The Additional Directories window </div>

Use the fields in the `Additional Directories` window to specify locations for the Advanced Server `Data Directory` and `Write-Ahead Log (WAL) Directory`.

The default `Data Directory` is `/opt/edb/as10/data`. You can use the file selector icon to specify an alternate location.

The default location of the Advanced Server `Write-Ahead Log (WAL) Directory` is `opt/edb/as10/data/pg_wal`. Accept the default location, or specify an alternate location with the file selector icon.

Advanced Server uses write-ahead logs to promote transaction safety and speed transaction processing; when you make a change to a table, the change is stored in shared memory and a record of the change is written to the write-ahead log. When you perform a `COMMIT`, Advanced Server writes contents of the write-ahead log to disk.

Accept the default file locations, or use the `File Browser` icon to select an alternate location; click `Next` to continue to the `Advanced Server Dialect` window.

This is not a comprehensive list of the compatibility features for Oracle included when Advanced Server is installed in `Compatible with Oracle` mode; for more information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Built-in Package Guide* available from the EnterpriseDB website at:

[https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs](/epas/10/epas_compat_bip_guide/)

If you choose to install in `Compatible with Oracle` mode, the Advanced Server superuser name is `enterprisedb`.

**Compatible with PostgreSQL**

If you select `Compatible with PostgreSQL`, Advanced Server will exhibit compatibility with PostgreSQL version 10. If you choose to install in `Compatible with PostgreSQL` mode, the default Advanced Server superuser name is `postgres`.

For detailed information about PostgreSQL functionality, visit the official PostgreSQL website at:

<http://www.postgresql.org>

After specifying a configuration mode, click `Next` to continue to the `Password` window.

![The Password window](images/password_window.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 8: The Password window </div>


Advanced Server uses the password specified on the `Password` window for the database superuser. The specified password must conform to any security policies existing on the Advanced Server host.

After you enter a password in the `Password` field, confirm the password in the `Retype Password` field, and click `Next` to continue.

The `Additional Configuration` window opens.

![The Additional Configuration window](images/additional_configuration.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 9: The Additional Configuration window </div>


Use the fields on the `Additional Configuration` window to specify installation details:

-   Use the `Port` field to specify the port number that Advanced Server should listen to for connection requests from client applications. The default is `5444`.
-   If the `Locale` field is set to `[Default locale]`, Advanced Server uses the system locale as the working locale. Use the drop-down listbox next to `Locale` to specify an alternate locale for Advanced Server.
-   By default, the `Setup` wizard installs corresponding sample data for the server dialect specified by the compatibility mode `(Oracle` or `PostgreSQL)`. Clear the check box next to `Install sample tables and procedures` if you do not wish to have sample data installed.

After verifying the information on the `Additional Configuration` window, click `Next` to open the `Dynatune Dynamic Tuning: Server Utilization` window.

The graphical `Setup` wizard facilitates performance tuning via the Dynatune Dynamic Tuning feature. Dynatune functionality allows Advanced Server to make optimal usage of the system resources available on the host machine on which it is installed.

![The Dynatune Dynamic Tuning: Server Utilization window](images/dynatune_dynamic_tuning_server_utilization.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 10: The Dynatune Dynamic Tuning: Server Utilization window </div>


The `edb_dynatune` configuration parameter determines how Advanced Server allocates system resources. Use the radio buttons on the `Server Utilization` window to set the initial value of the `edb_dynatune` configuration parameter:

-   Select `Development` to set the value of `edb_dynatune` to `33`. A low value dedicates the least amount of the host machine’s resources to the database server. This is a good choice for a development machine.
-   Select `General Purpose` to set the value of `edb_dynatune` to `66`. A mid-range value dedicates a moderate amount of system resources to the database server. This would be a good setting for an application server with a fixed number of applications running on the same host as Advanced Server.
-   Select `Dedicated` to set the value of `edb_dynatune` to `100`. A high value dedicates most of the system resources to the database server. This is a good choice for a dedicated server host.

After the installation is complete, you can adjust the value of `edb_dynatune` by editing the `postgresql.conf` file, located in the `data` directory of your Advanced Server installation. After editing the `postgresql.conf` file, you must restart the server for your changes to take effect.

Select the appropriate setting for your system, and click `Next` to continue to the `Dynatune Dynamic Tuning: Workload Profile` window.

![The Dynatune Dynamic Tuning: Workload Profile window](images/dynatune_dynamic_tuning_workload_profile.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 11: The Dynatune Dynamic Tuning: Workload Profile window </div>


Use the radio buttons on the `Workload Profile` window to specify the initial value of the `edb_dynatune_profile` configuration parameter. The `edb_dynatune_profile` parameter controls performance-tuning aspects based on the type of work that the server performs.

-   Select `Transaction Processing (OLTP systems)` to specify an `edb_dynatune_profile` value of `oltp`. Recommended when Advanced Server is supporting heavy online transaction processing.
-   Select `General Purpose (OLTP and reporting workloads)` to specify an `edb_dynatune_profile` value of `mixed`. Recommended for servers that provide a mix of transaction processing and data reporting.
-   Select `Reporting (Complex queries or OLAP workloads)` to specify an `edb_dynatune_profile` value of `reporting`. Recommended for database servers used for heavy data reporting.

After the installation is complete, you can adjust the value of `edb_dynatune_profile` by editing the `postgresql.conf` file, located in the `data` directory of your Advanced Server installation. After editing the `postgresql.conf` file, you must restart the server for your changes to take effect.

For more information about `edb_dynatune` and other performance-related topics, see the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server Guide* available from the EnterpriseDB website at:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs>

Click `Next` to continue. The `Update Notification Service` window opens.

![The Update Notification Service window](images/update_notification_service.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 12: The Update Notification Service window </div>


When enabled, the update notification service notifies you of any new updates and security patches available for your installation of Advanced Server.

By default, Advanced Server is configured to start the service when the system boots; clear the `Install Update Notification Service` check box, or accept the default, and click `Next` to continue.

The `Pre Installation Summary` opens.

![The Pre Installation Summary](images/pre_installation_summary.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 13: The Pre Installation Summary </div>


The `Pre Installation Summary` provides an overview of the options specified during the `Setup` process. Review the options before clicking `Next`; click `Back` to navigate back through the dialogs and update any options.

The `Ready to Install` window confirms that the installer has the information it needs about your configuration preferences to install Advanced Server. Click `Next` to continue.

![The Ready to Install window](images/ready_to_install.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 14: The Ready to Install window </div>


![Installing Advanced Server](images/installing_advanced_server.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 15: Installing Advanced Server </div>


As each supporting module is unpacked and installed, the module’s installation is confirmed with a progress bar.

Before the `Setup` wizard completes the Advanced Server installation, it offers to `Launch StackBuilder Plus at exit?`

![The Setup wizard offers to Launch StackBuilder Plus at exit](images/setup_wizard.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 16: The Setup wizard offers to Launch StackBuilder Plus at exit </div>


You can clear the `StackBuilder Plus` check box and click `Finish` to complete the Advanced Server installation, or accept the default and proceed to StackBuilder Plus.

EDB Postgres StackBuilder Plus is included with the installation of Advanced Server and its core supporting components. StackBuilder Plus is a graphical tool that can update installed products, or download and add supporting modules (and the resulting dependencies) after your Advanced Server setup and installation completes. See [Using StackBuilder Plus](#using-stackbuilder-plus) for more information about StackBuilder Plus.

### Invoking the Installer from the Command Line

The command line options of the Advanced Server installer offer functionality in situations where a graphical installation may not work because of limited resources or privileges. You can:

-  Include the `--mode unattended` option when invoking the installer to perform an installation without user input.
-  Include the `--mode text` option when invoking the installer to perform an installation from the command line.
-  Invoke the installer with the `--extract-only` option to perform a minimal installation when you don’t hold the privileges required to perform a complete installation.

Not all command line options are suitable for all platforms. For a complete reference guide to the command line options, see *Reference Command Line Options*.

If you are invoking the installer from the command line to perform a system upgrade, the installer will ignore command line options, and preserve the configuration of the previous installation.

### Performing a Text Mode Installation

To specify that the installer should run in text mode, include the `--mode text` command line option when invoking the installer. Text-mode installations are useful if you need to install on a remote server using ssh tunneling (and have access to a minimal amount of bandwidth), or if you do not have access to a graphical interface.

In text mode, the installer uses a series of command line questions to establish the configuration parameters. Text-mode installations are valid only on Linux systems.

You must assume superuser privileges before performing a text-mode installation. To perform a text-mode installation on a Linux system, navigate to the directory that contains the installation binary file and enter:

```text
./edb-as10-server-10.x.x.x-linux-x64.run --mode text
```

At any point during the installation process, you can press `Ctrl-C` to abort the installation.

The text mode installer welcomes you to the `Setup Wizard`, and introduces the `License Agreement`. Use the `Enter` key to page through the license agreement:

```text
Welcome to the EDB Postgres Advanced Server Setup Wizard.
----------------------------------------------------------
Please read the following License Agreement. You must
accept the terms of this agreement before continuing with
the installation.
Press [Enter] to continue:
```

Press `Enter` to continue reviewing the license agreement. After displaying the license, the installer prompts you to accept the license:

```text
Do you accept this license? [y/n]:
```

After reading the license agreement, enter `y` to accept the agreement and proceed with the installation. Enter `n` if you do not accept the license agreement; this will abort the installation. Press `Enter` to proceed.

Next, the installer will prompt you for the `User Authentication` information associated with your EnterpriseDB user account. This installation requires a registration with EnterpriseDB. If you do not have an account, create one on <https://www.enterprisedb.com/user-login-registration>.

When prompted, enter the email address of a registered account, and then the corresponding password: 

```text
Email []:
Password :
```

By default, Advanced Server is installed in `/opt/edb/as10`. Enter an alternate location, or press `Enter` to accept the default and continue to the component selection portion of the installation process.

Next, the installer prompts you individually for each component that is to be installed with Advanced Server. Select the components you want to install.

Enter `Y` or press `Enter` to accept the default value of `yes` after each component that you wish to include with the installation. Enter `n` to omit a component from the installation.

```text
EDB Postgres Advanced Server [Y/n] :
pgAdmin 4 [Y/n] :
StackBuilder Plus [Y/n] :
Command Line Tools [Y/n] :
```

The Advanced Server components are:

**EDB Postgres Advanced Server**

Press `Y` or `enter` after the EDB Postgres Advanced Server option to install Advanced Server 10.

**pgAdmin 4**

pgAdmin 4 provides a powerful graphical interface for database management and monitoring.

**StackBuilder Plus**

The StackBuilder Plus utility is a graphical tool that can update installed products, or download and add supporting modules (and the resulting dependencies) after your Advanced Server setup and installation completes. 

**Command Line Tools**

The `Command Line Tools` option installs command line tools and supporting client libraries including:

-   libpq
-   psql
-   EDB\*Loader
-   ecpgPlus
-   pg_basebackup, pg_dump, and pg_restore
-   pg_bench and more.

!!! Note
    The `Command Line Tools` are required if you are installing Advanced Server or pgAdmin 4.

After selecting components for installation, confirm that the list is correct by entering `Y`; enter `n` to iterate through the list of components a second time.

Next, the installer prompts you to specify the location of the `Additional Directories` required by Advanced Server. The default data directory is `/opt/edb/as10/data`. You can specify an alternate location, or press `Enter` to accept the default and continue.

```text
Please select a directory under which to store your data.
Data Directory [/opt/edb/as10/data]: 
```

The default location of the Advanced Server `Write-Ahead Log (WAL) Directory` is `/opt/edb/as10/data/pg_wal`. Press `Enter` to accept the default location and continue, or specify an alternate location.

```text
Please select a directory under which to store your WriteAhead Logs.
Write-Ahead Log (WAL) Directory [/opt/edb/as10/data/pg_wal]:
```

Advanced Server uses write-ahead logs to help ensure transaction safety and speed transaction processing; when you make a change to a table, the change is stored in shared memory and a record of the change is written to the write-ahead log. When you `COMMIT` a transaction, Advance Server writes contents of the write-ahead log to disk.

Next, the installer prompts you to select an `Advanced Server Dialect`.

```text
EDB Postgres Advanced Server can be configured in one of two "Dialects" - 1) Compatible with Oracle or 2) Compatible with Postgres.

If you select Compatible with Oracle, Advanced Server will be configured with appropriate data type conversions, time and date formats, Oracle-styled operators, dictionary views and more. This makes it easier to migrate or write new applications that are more compatible with the Oracle database.

If you select Compatible with Postgres, Advanced Server will be configured with standard PostgeSQL data types, time/date formats and operators.

Advanced Server Dialect
[1] Compatible with Oracle
[2] Compatible with PostgreSQL
Please choose an option [1] :
```

The configuration mode specifies the server dialect with which Advanced Server will be compatible; you can choose between `Compatible with Oracle` and `Compatible with PostgreSQL` installation modes.

**Compatible with Oracle**

If you select `Compatible with Oracle`, the installation will include the following features:

-   Data dictionary views that is compatible with Oracle databases.
-   Date values displayed in a format compatible with Oracle syntax.
-   Support for Oracle-styled concatenation rules (if you concatenate a string value with a `NULL` value, the returned value is the value of the string).
-   Schemas (`dbo` and `sys`) compatible with Oracle databases added to the `SEARCH_PATH`.
-   Support for the following Oracle built-in packages:

| Package          | Functionality compatible with Oracle Databases                                                                                                                               |

This is not a comprehensive list of the compatibility features for Oracle included when Advanced Server is installed in `Compatible with Oracle` mode; for more information, see the *Database Compatibility for Oracle Developers Built-in Package Guide* available from the EnterpriseDB website at:

[https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs](/epas/10/epas_compat_bip_guide/)

If you choose to install in `Compatible with Oracle` mode, the Advanced Server superuser name is `enterprisedb`.

**Compatible with PostgreSQL**

If you select `Compatible with PostgreSQL`, Advanced Server will exhibit compatibility with PostgreSQL version 10. If you choose to install in `Compatible with PostgreSQL` mode, the default Advanced Server superuser name is `postgres`.

For detailed information about PostgreSQL functionality, visit the official PostgreSQL website at:

<http://www.postgresql.org>

Press `Enter` to accept the default configuration mode `(Compatible with Oracle)` and continue; enter `2` and press `Enter` to install in `Compatible with PostgreSQL` mode. 

Next, the installer prompts you for a database superuser password.

```text
Please provide a password for the database superuser (enterprisedb). A locked Unix user account (enterprisedb) will be created if not present.

Password :

Retype Password :
```

Advanced Server uses the password specified for the database superuser. The password must conform to any security policies existing on the Advanced Server host.

After entering a password in the `Password` field, confirm the password and press `Enter` to continue. The installer prompts you for `Additional Configuration` information.

When prompted, enter the `Port` that the Advanced Server service will monitor for connections. By default, Advanced Server chooses the first available port after port number `5444`.

Specify a `Locale` by entering a locale number from the list shown. Accept the `Default locale` value to instruct the installer to use the system locale as the server locale.

```text
Select the locale to be used by the new database cluster.

Locale
[1] [Default locale]
[2] C
[3] POSIX
Please choose an option [1] :
```

When prompted, enter `Y` (or press `Enter` to accept the default value) to install the sample tables and procedures for the database dialect specified by the compatibility mode (Oracle or PostgreSQL).

Dynatune functionality allows Advanced Server to make optimal usage of the system resources available on the host machine. To facilitate performance tuning through Dynatune, the installer prompts you first for `Server Utilization` information.

```text
Dynatune Dynamic Tuning: Server Utilization

Please select the type of server to determine the amount of system resources that may be utilized:

[1] Development (e.g. a developer's laptop)
[2] General Purpose (e.g. a web or application server)
[3] Dedicated (a server running only EDB Postgres)
Please choose an option [2] : 
```

The `edb_dynatune` configuration parameter determines how Advanced Server allocates system resources. Your selection will establish the initial value of `edb_dynatune`.

-   Select `Development` to set the value of `edb_dynatune` to `33`. A low value dedicates the least amount of the host machine’s resources to the database server. This is a good choice for a development machine.
-   Select `General Purpose` to set the value of `edb_dynatune` to `66`. A mid-range value dedicates a moderate amount of system resources to the database server. This would be a good setting for an application server with a fixed number of applications running on the same host as Advanced Server.
-   Select `Dedicated` to set the value of `edb_dynatune` to `100`. A high value dedicates most of the system resources to the database server. This is a good choice for a dedicated server host.

Enter a value of `1`, `2`, or `3`, or accept the default value of `2` (to indicate that the server will be used for `General Purpose` processing) and press `Enter` to continue.

Next, the Advanced Server installer prompts for information about the type of workload the system will be processing.

```text
Dynatune Dynamic Tuning:
Workload Profile

Please select the type of workload this server will be used for:

[1] Transaction Processing (OLTP systems)
[2] General Purpose (OLTP and reporting workloads)
[3] Reporting (Complex queries or OLAP workloads)
Please choose an option [1] : 
```

The installer uses the `Workload Profile` to establish the initial value of the `edb_dynatune_profile` configuration parameter. The `edb_dynatune_profile` parameter controls performance-tuning aspects based on the type of work that the server performs.

-   Enter `1` to indicate `Transaction Processing (OLTP systems)` and set the value of `edb_dynatune_profile` to `oltp`. Recommended when Advanced Server is supporting heavy online transaction processing workloads.
-   Enter `2` to indicate `General Purpose (OLTP and reporting workloads)` and set the value of `edb_dynatune_profile` to `mixed`. Recommended for servers that provide a mix of transaction processing and data reporting.
-   Enter `3` to indicate `Reporting (Complex queries or OLAP workloads)` and set the value of `edb_dynatune_profile` to `reporting`. Recommended for database servers used for heavy data reporting.

After choosing a `Workload Profile`, press `Enter` to continue.

After the installation is complete, you can adjust the values of `edb_dynatune` and `edb_dynatune_profile` by editing the `postgresql.conf` file, located in the `data` directory of your Advanced Server installation. After editing the `postgresql.conf` file, you must restart the server for your changes to take effect.

For more information about `edb_dynatune` and other performance-related topics, see the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server Guide* available from the EnterpriseDB website at:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs>

If enabled, the Update Notification Service notifies you of any available updates and security patches for your installation of Advanced Server.

```text
Update Notification Service
Update Notification Service [Y/n]: 
```

By default, the installer specifies that Advanced Server should enable the notification service when the system boots; specify `n` to disable the notification service, or accept the default, and press `Enter` to continue to the `Pre Installation Summary`.

```text
Pre Installation Summary

Following settings will be used for installation:

Installation Directory: /opt/edb/as10

########################################
```

The installer informs you when the installation is complete.

### Performing  an Unattended Installation

To specify that the installer should run without user interaction, include the `--mode unattended` command line option. In unattended mode, the installer uses one of the following sources for configuration parameters:

-   command line options (specified when invoking the installer)
-   parameters specified in an option file
-   Advanced Server installation defaults

You can embed the non-interactive Advanced Server installer within another application installer; during the installation process, a progress bar allows the user to view the progression of the installation.

You must have superuser privileges to install Advanced Server using the `--mode unattended` option on a Linux system. If you are using the `--mode unattended` option to install Advanced Server with another installer, the calling installer must be invoked with superuser privileges.

To install in unattended mode, navigate to the directory that contains the Advanced Server installer and enter:

```text
./edb-as10-server-10.x.x-x-linux-x64.run --mode unattended
--superpassword database_superuser_password --webusername
edb_user_name@email.com --webpassword edb_user_password
```

The `--superpassword` option specifies a password for the database superuser. If you omit the option, the database superuser password defaults to `enterprisedb`. The default password can be easily guessed by a potential intruder; be sure to provide a stronger password with the `--superpassword` option.

You must include the `--webusername` and `--webpassword` options to specify the identity of a registered EnterpriseDB user. There is no charge to register for an EnterpriseDB user account; if you do not have an account, you can create one at:

<http://www.enterprisedb.com/user-login-registration>

You can control configuration parameters for Advanced Server by specifying options at the command line, or by including the parameters (in option=value pairs) in a configuration file. A sample configuration file might include:

```text
mode=unattended
prefix=/opt/edb/as10
datadir=/opt/edb/as10/data
serverport=5444
webusername=edb_user_name@email.com
webpassword=edb_user_password
```

Then, when you invoke the installer, include the `--optionfile` parameter, and the complete path to the configuration parameter file.

```text
./edb-as10-server-10.x.x-x-linux-x64.run --optionfile
/$HOME/config_param
```

### Performing an Installation with Limited Privileges

To perform an abbreviated installation of Advanced Server without access to root or administrative privileges, invoke the installer from the command line and include the `--extract-only` option. Invoking the installer with the `--extract-only` option extracts the binary files in an unaltered form, allowing you to experiment with a minimal installation of Advanced Server.

If you invoke the installer with the `--extract-only` options, you can either manually create a cluster and start the service, or run the installation script. To manually create the cluster, you must:

-   Initialize the cluster
-   Configure the cluster
-   Start and stop the service with pg_ctl

For more information about the `initdb` and `pg_ctl` commands, see the PostgreSQL Core Documentation at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/app-initdb.html>

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/app-pg-ctl.html>

If you include the `--extract-only` option when you invoke the installer, the installer steps through a shortened form of the `Setup` wizard. During the brief installation process, the installer generates an installation script that can be later used to complete a more complete installation. To invoke the installation script, you must have superuser privileges on Linux.

The installation script:

-   Initializes the database cluster if the cluster is empty.
-   Configures the server to start at boot-time.
-   Establishes initial values for Dynatune (dynamic tuning) variables.

The scripted Advanced Server installation does not create menu shortcuts or access to EDB Postgres StackBuilder Plus, and no modifications are made to registry files.

To perform a limited installation and generate an installation script, download and unpack the Advanced Server installer. Navigate into the directory that contains the installer, and invoke the installer with the command:

```text
./edb-as10-server-10.x.x-x-linux-x64.run --extract-only yes
```

A dialog opens, prompting you to choose an installation language. Select a language for the installation and click `OK` to continue. The `Setup` Wizard opens.

![The Ready to Install window](images/ready_to_install.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 21: The Ready to Install window </div>

Click `Next` to proceed with the Advanced Server installation. During the installation, progress bars and popups mark the installation progress. The installer notifies you when the installation is complete.

![The Setup wizard offers to Launch StackBuilder Plus at exit](images/setup_wizard.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 22: The Advanced Server installation is complete </div>

After completing the minimal installation, you can execute a script to initialize a cluster and start the service. The script is (by default) located in the following directories:

```text
/opt/edb
```

To execute the installation script, open a command line and assume superuser or administrative privileges. Navigate to the directory that contains the script, and execute the command:

```text
./runAsRoot.sh
```

The installation script executes at the command line, prompting you for installation configuration information. The default configuration value is displayed in square braces immediately before each prompt; update the default value or press `Enter` to accept the default value and continue.

**Example**

The following dialog is an example of a scripted installation on a Linux system. The actual installation dialog will vary by platform and reflect the options specified during the installation.

```text
======================
INSTALLATION DIRECTORY
======================
Please enter the installation directory [ /opt/edb ] :
```

The installation directory is the directory where Advanced Server is installed.

```text
==============
DATA DIRECTORY
==============
NOTE: If data directory exists and postgresql.conf file exists in that directory, we will not initialize the cluster.

Please enter the data directory path: [ /opt/edb/as10/data ] :
```

The data directory is the directory where Advanced Server data is stored.

```text
=============
WAL DIRECTORY
=============
Please enter the Write-Ahead Log (WAL) directory path:
 [ /opt/edb/as10/data/pg_wal ] :
``` 

The WAL directory is where the write-ahead log will be written.

```text
=============
DATABASE MODE
=============
Please enter database mode: [ oracle ] :
```

Database mode specifies the database dialect with which the Advanced Server installation is compatible. The optional values are `oracle` or `postgresql`.

**Compatible with Oracle**

Specify `oracle` mode to include the following functionality:

-   Data dictionary views that is compatible with Oracle databases.
-   Date values displayed in a format compatible with Oracle syntax.
-   Support for Oracle-styled concatenation rules (if you concatenate a string value with a `NULL` value, the returned value is the value of the string).
-   Schemas (`dbo` and `sys`) compatible with Oracle databases added to the `SEARCH_PATH`.
-   Support for the following Oracle built-in packages.

If you choose to install in `Compatible with Oracle` mode, the Advanced Server superuser name is `enterprisedb`.

**Compatible with PostgreSQL**

Specify `postgresql` to install Advanced Server with complete compatibility with Postgres version 10. If you choose to install in `Compatible with PostgreSQL` mode, the default Advanced Server superuser name is `postgres`.

```text
====
PORT

Please re-type password for the super-user(enterprisedb): [ ] :
```

Specify and confirm a password for the database superuser. By default, the database superuser is named `enterprisedb`. 

```text
==================
SERVER UTILIZATION
==================
Please enter the server utilization: [ 66 ] :
```

Specify a value between `1` and `100`.

The server utilization value is used as an initial value for the `edb_dynatune` configuration parameter. `edb_dynatune` determines how Advanced Server allocates system resources.

-   A low value dedicates the least amount of the host machine’s resources to the database server; a low value is a good choice for a development machine.
-   A mid-range value dedicates a moderate amount of system resources to the database server. A mid-range value is a good setting for an application server with a fixed number of applications running on the same host as Advanced Server.
-   A high value dedicates most of the system resources to the database server. This is a good choice for a dedicated server host.

After the installation is complete, you can adjust the value of `edb_dynatune` by editing the `postgresql.conf` file, located in the `data` directory of your Advanced Server installation. After editing the `postgresql.conf` file, you must restart the server for the changes to take effect.

```text
================
WORKLOAD PROFILE
================
Please enter the workload profile: [ oltp ] :
```

The workload profile value is used as an initial value for the `edb_dynatune_profile` configuration parameter. `edb_dynatune_profile` controls performance-tuning based on the type of work that the server performs.

-   Specify `oltp` if the server will be supporting heavy online transaction workloads.
-   Specify `mixed` if the server will provide a mix of transaction processing and data reporting.
-   Specify `reporting` if the database server will be used for heavy data reporting.

After the installation is complete, you can adjust the value of `edb_dynatune_profile` by editing the `postgresql.conf` file, located in the `data` directory of your Advanced Server installation, and restarting the server.

Before continuing with the installation, the installer displays the selected options and initializes the database cluster in preparation for the installation of individual components. When the installer has prepared the system for the installation, the installation begins. Before installing a component, the installer prompts you to select modules for installation. With each component, onscreen warnings may alert you to unresolved dependencies.

*Please note that the available components are different for each platform, and the prompts that follow may vary.*

The installer saves the specified configuration values in the following file:

```text
'/opt/edb/.rar_options_xxxxx'
```

After continued processing, the Advanced Server installation is complete.

### Reference - Command Line Options

You can optionally include the following parameters for an Advanced Server installation on the command line, or in a configuration file when invoking the Advanced Server installer.

`--create_samples { yes | no }`

Use the `--create_samples` option to specify whether the installer should create the sample tables and procedures for the database dialect specified with the `--databasemode` parameter. The default is `yes`.

`--databasemode { oracle | postgresql }`

Use the `--databasemode` parameter to specify a database dialect. The default is `oracle`.

`--datadir data_directory`

Use the `--datadir` parameter to specify a location for the cluster's data directory. `data_directory` is the name of the directory; include the complete path to the desired directory.

`--debuglevel { 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 }`

Use the `--debuglevel` parameter to set the level of detail written to the `debug_log` file (see `--debugtrace`). Higher values produce more detail in a longer trace file. The default is `2`.

`--debugtrace debug_log`

Use the `--debugtrace` parameter to troubleshoot installation problems. `debug_log` is the name of the file that contains troubleshooting details.

`--disable-components component_list`

Use the `--disable-components` parameter to specify a list of Advanced Server components to exclude from the installation. By default, `component_list` contains '' (the empty string). `component_list` is a comma-separated list containing one or more of the following components:

`dbserver`

EDB Postgres Advanced Server 10.

`pgadmin4`

The EDB Postgres pgAdmin 4 provides a powerful graphical interface for database management and monitoring.

`--enable-components component_list`

Although this option is listed when you run the installer with the `--help` option, the `--enable-components` parameter has absolutely no effect on which components are installed. All components will be installed regardless of what is specified in `component_list`. In order to install only specific selected components, you must use the `--disable-components` parameter previously described in this section to list the components you do not want to install.

`--extract-only { yes | no }`

Include the `--extract-only` parameter to indicate that the installer should extract the Advanced Server binaries without performing a complete installation. Superuser privileges are not required for the `--extract-only` option. The default value is `no`.

`--help`

Include the `--help` parameter to view a list of the optional parameters.

`--installer-language { en | ja | zh_CN | zh_TW | ko }`

Use the `--installer-language` parameter to specify an installation language for Advanced Server. The default is `en`.

`en` specifies English.

`ja` specifies Japanese

`zh_CN` specifies Chinese Simplified.

`zh_TW` specifies Traditional Chinese.

`ko` specifies Korean.

`--locale locale`

Specifies the locale for the Advanced Server cluster. By default, the installer will use to the locale detected by `initdb`.

`--mode {qt | gtk | text | unattended}`

Use the `--mode` parameter to specify an installation mode. The following modes are supported:

-  `qt` - Specify `qt` to tell the installer to use the Qt graphical toolkit
-  `gtk` - Specify `gtk` to tell the installer to use the GTK graphical toolkit.
-  `text` - Specify text to perform a text mode installation in a console window. This is a Linux-only option.
-  `unattended` - Specify `unattended` to specify that the installer should perform an installation that requires no user input during the installation process.

`--optionfile config_file`

Use the `--optionfile` parameter to specify the name of a file that contains the installation configuration parameters. `config_file` must specify the complete path to the configuration parameter file.

`--prefix installation_dir/as10.x`

Use the `--prefix` parameter to specify an installation directory for Advanced Server. The installer will append a version-specific sub-directory (that is, `as10`) to the specified directory. The default installation directory is:

```text
/opt/edb/as10
```

`--productkey product_key`

Use the `--productkey` parameter to specify a value for the product key. The `--productkey` parameter is only required when the specified system locale is Japanese, Chinese, or Korean.

`--serverport port_number`

Use the `--serverport` parameter to specify a listener port number for Advanced Server.

If you are installing Advanced Server in unattended mode, and do not specify a value using the `--serverport` parameter, the installer will use port `5444`, or the first available port after port `5444` as the default listener port.

`--server_utilization {33 | 66 | 100}`

Use the `--server_utilization` parameter to specify a value for the `edb_dynatune` configuration parameter. The `edb_dynatune` configuration parameter determines how Advanced Server allocates system resources.

-   A value of `33` is appropriate for a system used for development. A low value dedicates the least amount of the host machine’s resources to the database server.
-   A value of `66` is appropriate for an application server with a fixed number of applications. A mid-range value dedicates a moderate amount of system resources to the database server. The default value is 66.
-   A value of `100` is appropriate for a host machine that is dedicated to running Advanced Server. A high value dedicates most of the system resources to the database server.

When the installation is complete, you can adjust the value of `edb_dynatune` by editing the `postgresql.conf` file, located in the `data` directory of your Advanced Server installation. After editing the `postgresql.conf` file, you must restart the server for the changes to take effect.

`--serviceaccount user_account_name`

Use the `--serviceaccount` parameter to specify the name of the user account that owns the server process.

-   If `--databasemode` is set to `oracle` (the default), the default value of `--serviceaccount` is `enterprisedb`.
-   If `--databasemode` is `postgresql`, the default value of `--serviceaccount` is set to `postgres`.

Please note that for security reasons, the `--serviceaccount` parameter must specify the name of an account that does not hold superuser privileges.

`--servicename service_name`

Use the `--servicename` parameter to specify the name of the Advanced Server service. The default is `edb-as-10`.

`--superaccount super_user_name`

Use the `--superaccount` parameter to specify the user name of the database superuser.

-   If `--databasemode` is set to `oracle` (the default), the default value of `--superaccount` is `enterprisedb`.
-   If `--databasemode` is set to `postgresql`, the default value of `--superaccount` is set to `postgres`.

`--superpassword superuser_password`

Use `--superpassword` to specify the database superuser password. If you are installing in non-interactive mode, `--superpassword` defaults to `enterprisedb`.

`--unattendedmodeui { none | minimal | minimalWithDialogs }`

Use the `--unattendedmodeui` parameter to specify installer behavior during an unattended installation.

Include `--unattendedmodeui none` to specify that the installer should not display progress bars during the Advanced Server installation.

Include `--unattendedmodeui minimal` to specify that the installer should display progress bars during the installation process. This is the default behavior.

Include `--unattendedmodeui minimalWithDialogs` to specify that the installer should display progress bars and report any errors encountered during the installation process (in additional dialogs).

`--version`

Include the `--version` parameter to retrieve version information about the installer:

`EDB Postgres Advanced Server EDB Postgres Advanced Server 10 --- Built on 2018-03-15 00:04:00 IB: 15.11.1-201511121057`

`--webusername {registered_username}`

You must specify the name of a registered user and password when performing an installation of EDB Postgres Advanced Server 10. Use the `--webusername` parameter to specify the name of the registered EnterpriseDB user that is performing the installation.

`registered_username` must be an email address.

`--webpassword {associated_password}`

Use the `--webpassword` parameter to specify the password associated with the registered EnterpriseDB user that is performing the installation.

`--workload_profile {oltp | mixed | reporting}`

Use the `--workload_profile` parameter to specify an initial value for the `edb_dynatune_profile` configuration parameter. `edb_dynatune_profile` controls aspects of performance-tuning based on the type of work that the server performs.

-   Specify `oltp` if the Advanced Server installation will be used to support heavy online transaction processing workloads.
-   The default value is `oltp`.
-   Specify `mixed` if Advanced Server will provide a mix of transaction processing and data reporting.
-   Specify `reporting` if Advanced Server will be used for heavy data reporting.

After the installation is complete, you can adjust the value of `edb_dynatune_profile` by editing the `postgresql.conf` file, located in the `data` directory of your Advanced Server installation. After editing the `postgresql.conf` file, you must restart the server for the changes to take effect.

For more information about `edb_dynatune` and other performance-related topics, see the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server Guide* available at:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs>

`--xlogdir directory_name`

Use the `--xlogdir` parameter to specify a location for the write-ahead log. The default value is `/opt/edb/as10/data/pg_wal`.

## Using StackBuilder Plus

The StackBuilder Plus utility provides a graphical interface that simplifies the process of updating, downloading, and installing modules that complement your Advanced Server installation. When you install a module with StackBuilder Plus, StackBuilder Plus automatically resolves any software dependencies.

You must install the `redhat-lsb` package before invoking StackBuilder Plus. 

You can invoke StackBuilder Plus at any time after the installation has completed by selecting the `StackBuilder Plus` menu option from the `EDB Postgres --> Advanced Server 10` menu. Enter your system password (if prompted), and the StackBuilder Plus welcome window opens.

![The StackBuilder Plus welcome window](images/stackbuilder_plus_welcome.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 23: The StackBuilder Plus welcome window </div>


Use the drop-down listbox on the welcome window to select your Advanced Server installation.

StackBuilder Plus requires Internet access; if your installation of Advanced Server resides behind a firewall (with restricted Internet access), StackBuilder Plus can download program installers through a proxy server. The module provider determines if the module can be accessed through an HTTP proxy or an FTP proxy; currently, all updates are transferred via an HTTP proxy and the FTP proxy information is not used.

If the selected Advanced Server installation has restricted Internet access, use the `Proxy Servers` on the `Welcome` window to open the `Proxy servers` dialog.

![The Proxy Servers dialog](images/proxy_servers.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 24: The Proxy Servers dialog </div>


Enter the IP address and port number of the proxy server in the `HTTP proxy` on the `Proxy Servers` dialog. Currently, all StackBuilder Plus modules are distributed via HTTP proxy (FTP proxy information is ignored). Click `OK` to continue.

![The StackBuilder Plus module selection window](images/stackbuilder_plus_module_selection.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 25: The StackBuilder Plus module selection window </div>


The tree control on the StackBuilder Plus module selection window displays a node for each module category.

Expand a module, and highlight a component name in the tree control to review a detailed description of the component. To add one or more components to the installation or to upgrade a component, check the box to the left of a module name and click `Next`. A window opens, requesting your EnterpriseDB registration information.

![User Authentication](images/user_auth.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 26: The User Authenication window </div>

Before downloading and installing modules and updates with StackBuilder Plus, you must enter the user information associated with your EnterpriseDB account. If you do not have an EnterpriseDB user account, click the link provided to open a web browser, and enter your user information.

Enter the email address of a registered account in the `Email` field, and the corresponding password in the `Password` field, and click `Next` to continue. 

StackBuilder Plus confirms the packages selected.

![A summary window displays a list of selected packages](images/summary_window_displaying_selected_packages.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 27: A summary window displays a list of selected packages </div>

By default, the selected package installers are downloaded to `/root`.

Use the browse icon (...) to the right of the `Download directory` field to open a file selector, and choose an alternate location to store the downloaded installers. Click `Next` to connect to the server and download the required installation files.

When the download completes, a window opens that confirms the installation files have been downloaded and are ready for installation.

![Confirmation that the download process is complete](images/download_complete.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 28: Confirmation that the download process is complete </div>


You can check the box next to `Skip Installation`, and select `Next` to exit StackBuilder Plus without installing the downloaded files, or leave the box unchecked and click `Next` to start the installation process.

Each downloaded installer has different requirements. As the installers execute, they may prompt you to confirm acceptance of license agreements, to enter passwords, and provide configuration information.

During the installation process, you may be prompted by one (or more) of the installers to restart your system. Select `No` or `Restart Later` until all installations are completed. When the last installation has completed, reboot the system to apply all of the updates.

You may occasionally encounter packages that don’t install successfully. If a package fails to install, StackBuilder Plus will alert you to the installation error with a popup dialog, and write a message to the log file at `/root`.

![StackBuilder Plus confirms the completed installation](images/stackbuilder_plus_completed_installation.png)

<div style="text-align: center"> Fig. 29: StackBuilder Plus confirms the completed installation </div>


When the installation is complete, StackBuilder Plus will alert you to the success or failure of the installations of the requested packages. If you were prompted by an installer to restart your computer, reboot now.

## Connecting to Advanced Server with the pgAdmin 4 Client

pgAdmin 4 provides an interactive graphical interface that you can use to manage your database and database objects.
