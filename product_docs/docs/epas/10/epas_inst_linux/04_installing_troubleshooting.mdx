**Difficulty Displaying Java-based Applications**

If you encounter difficulty displaying Java-based server features (controls or text not being displayed correctly, or blank windows), upgrading to the latest `libxcb-xlib` libraries should correct the problem on most distributions. Please visit the following link for other possible work-arounds:

**Applications Fail to Launch During an Advanced Server Installation**

If applications fail to launch (such as StackBuilder Plus or your web browser) during the installation process on a Linux system, verify that the `xdg-open` program is on your system. If `xdg-open` is missing, install the `xdg-utils` package.

If you are using the GNOME desktop, load the root profile before running the Advanced Server installation script. To load the root profile, issue the command, `su - root` instead of `su root` before installing Advanced Server.

**Configuration File Editors Close Spontaneously**

If you are using a gnome console, a bug in the gnome shell may cause configuration file editors accessed via the Expert Configuration menu (under the Advanced Server Application menu) to close spontaneously. To correct this error, open a terminal window and enter:

```text
dconf write /org/gnome/settings-daemon/plugins/cursor/active
false
```

Please note that each time you reboot your system, you must invoke the command, resetting the value. 

**The Installation Fails to Complete Due to Existing data Directory Contents**

If an installation fails to complete due to an existing content in the data directory, the server will write an error message to the server logs:

`A data directory is neither empty, or a recognisable data directory.`

If you encounter a similar message, you should confirm that the data directory is empty; the presence of files (including the system-generated `lost+found` folder) will prevent the installation from completing. Either remove the files from the data directory, or specify a different location for the data directory before re-invoking the installer to complete the installation.

**Difficulty Installing the EPEL Release Package**

If you encounter difficulty when installing the `EPEL` release package, you can use the following command to install the `epel-release` package on RHEL or CentOS 7.x:

```text
yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
```

Please note that you may need to enable the `[extras]` repository definition in the `CentOS-Base.repo` file (located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`). If `yum` cannot access a repository that contains `epel-release`, you will get an error message:

```text
No package epel available.
Error: Nothing to do
```

If you receive this error, you can download the `EPEL` rpm package, and install it manually. To manually install `EPEL`, download the rpm package, assume superuser privileges, navigate into the directory that contains the package, and install `EPEL` with the command:

```text
yum -y install epel-release
```
