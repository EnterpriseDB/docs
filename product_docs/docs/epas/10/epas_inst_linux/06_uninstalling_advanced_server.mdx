Note that after uninstalling Advanced Server, the cluster data files remain intact and the service user persists. You may manually remove the cluster `data` and service user from the system.

## Uninstalling an RPM Package

You can use variations of the `rpm` or `yum` command to remove installed packages. Note that removing a package does not damage the Advanced Server `data` directory.

Include the `-e` option when invoking the `rpm` command to remove an installed package; the command syntax is:

```text
rpm -e <package_name>
```

Where `package_name` is the name of the package that you would like to remove.

You can use the `yum remove` command to remove a package installed by `yum`. To remove a package, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter the command:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum remove <package_name>
    ```

Where `package_name` is the name of the package that you would like to remove.

`yum` and RPM will not remove a package that is required by another package. If you attempt to remove a package that satisfies a package dependency, `yum` or RPM will provide a warning.

To uninstall Advanced Server and its dependent packages; use the following command:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum remove edb-as10-server*
    ```

## Using Advanced Server Uninstallers at the Command Line

The Advanced Server interactive installer creates an uninstaller that you can use to remove Advanced Server or components bundled with the installer (pgAdmin 4, StackBuilder Plus, or the command line tools). If you uninstall an Advanced Server component, the remainder of the Advanced Server installation will remain intact.

The uninstaller is created in `/opt/edb/as10`. To open the uninstaller, assume superuser privileges, navigate into the directory that contains the uninstaller, and enter:

```text
./uninstall-edb-as10-server
```
