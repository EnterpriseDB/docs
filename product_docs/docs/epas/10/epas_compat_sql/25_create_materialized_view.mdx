**Name**

`CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` -- define a new materialized view.

**Synopsis**

```text
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW <name>
   [<build_clause>][<create_mv_refresh>] AS subquery

      Where <build_clause> is:

      BUILD {IMMEDIATE | DEFERRED}

      Where <create_mv_refresh> is:

      REFRESH [COMPLETE] [ON DEMAND]
```

**Description**

`CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` defines a view of a query that is not updated each time the view is referenced in a query. By default, the view is populated when the view is created; you can include the `BUILD DEFERRED` keywords to delay the population of the view.

A materialized view may be schema-qualified; if you specify a schema name when invoking the `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` command, the view will be created in the specified schema. The view name must be distinct from the name of any other view, table, sequence, or index in the same schema.

**Parameters**

`name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of a view to be created.

`subquery`

 A `SELECT` statement that specifies the contents of the view. Refer to `SELECT` for more information about valid queries.

`build_clause`

 Include a `build_clause` to specify when the view should be populated. Specify `BUILD IMMEDIATE`, or `BUILD DEFERRED`:

-   `BUILD IMMEDIATE` instructs the server to populate the view immediately. This is the default behavior.
-   `BUILD DEFERRED` instructs the server to populate the view at a later time (during a `REFRESH` operation).

`create_mv_refresh`

 Include the `create_mv_refresh` clause to specify when the contents of a materialized view should be updated. The clause contains the `REFRESH` keyword followed by `COMPLETE` and/or `ON DEMAND`, where:

-   `COMPLETE` instructs the server to discard the current content and reload the materialized view by executing the view's defining query when the materialized view is refreshed.

-   `ON DEMAND` instructs the server to refresh the materialized view on demand by calling the `DBMS_MVIEW` package or by calling the Postgres `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` statement. This is the default behavior.

**Notes**

Materialized views are read only - the server will not allow an `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE` on a view.

Access to tables referenced in the view is determined by permissions of the view owner; the user of a view must have permissions to call all functions used by the view.

For more information about the Postgres `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW` command, see the PostgreSQL Core Documentation available at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/sql-refreshmaterializedview.html>

**Examples**

The following statement creates a materialized view named `dept_30`:

```text
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW dept_30 BUILD IMMEDIATE AS SELECT * FROM emp WHERE deptno = 30;
```

The view contains information retrieved from the `emp` table about any employee that works in department `30`.
