**Name**

`DROP FUNCTION` -- remove a function.

**Synopsis**

```text
DROP FUNCTION <name>
  [ ([ [ <argmode> ] [ <argname> ] <argtype> ] [, ...]) ]
```

**Description**

`DROP FUNCTION` removes the definition of an existing function. To execute this command you must be a superuser or the owner of the function. All input (`IN`, `IN OUT`) argument data types to the function must be specified if there is at least one input argument. (This requirement is not compatible with Oracle databases. In Oracle, only the function name is specified. Advanced Server allows overloading of function names, so the function signature given by the input argument data types is required in the Advanced Server `DROP FUNCTION` command.)

**Parameters**

`name`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing function.

`argmode`

 The mode of an argument: `IN`, `IN OUT`, or `OUT`. If omitted, the default is `IN`. Note that `DROP FUNCTION` does not actually pay any attention to `OUT` arguments, since only the input arguments are needed to determine the function’s identity. So it is sufficient to list only the `IN` and `IN OUT` arguments. (Specification of `argmode` is not compatible with Oracle databases and applies only to Advanced Server.)

`argname`

 The name of an argument. Note that `DROP FUNCTION` does not actually pay any attention to argument names, since only the argument data types are needed to determine the function’s identity. (Specification of `argname` is not compatible with Oracle databases and applies only to Advanced Server.)

`argtype`

 The data type of an argument of the function. (Specification of `argtype` is not compatible with Oracle databases and applies only to Advanced Server.)

**Examples**

The following command removes the `emp_comp` function.

```text
DROP FUNCTION emp_comp(NUMBER, NUMBER);
```
