**Name**

`ALTER USER|ROLE`

**Synopsis**

```text
ALTER USER|ROLE <name> [[WITH] option[…]
```

where `option` can be the following compatible clauses:

```text
  PROFILE <profile_name>
| ACCOUNT {LOCK|UNLOCK}
| PASSWORD EXPIRE [AT '<timestamp>']
```

or `option` can be the following non-compatible clauses:

```text
| PASSWORD SET AT '<timestamp>'
| LOCK TIME '<timestamp>'
| STORE PRIOR PASSWORD {'<password>' '<timestamp>} [, ...]
```

For information about the administrative clauses of the `ALTER USER` or `ALTER ROLE` command that are supported by Advanced Server, see the PostgreSQL core documentation available at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/sql-commands.html>

Only a database superuser can use the `ALTER USER|ROLE` clauses that enforce profile management. The clauses enforce the following behaviors:

-   Include the `PROFILE` clause and a `profile_name` to associate a pre-defined profile with a role, or to change which pre-defined profile is associated with a user.

-   Include the `ACCOUNT` clause and the `LOCK` or `UNLOCK` keyword to specify that the user account should be placed in a locked or unlocked state.

-   Include the `LOCK TIME` `'timestamp'` clause and a date/time value to lock the role at the specified time, and unlock the role at the time indicated by the `PASSWORD_LOCK_TIME` parameter of the profile assigned to this role. If `LOCK TIME` is used with the `ACCOUNT LOCK` clause, the role can only be unlocked by a database superuser with the `ACCOUNT UNLOCK` clause.

-   Include the `PASSWORD EXPIRE` clause with the `AT 'timestamp'` keywords to specify a date/time when the password associated with the role will expire. If you omit the `AT 'timestamp'` keywords, the password will expire immediately.

-   Include the `PASSWORD SET AT 'timestamp'` keywords to set the password modification date to the time specified.

-   Include the `STORE PRIOR PASSWORD {'password' 'timestamp} [, ...]` clause to modify the password history, adding the new password and the time the password was set.

Each login role may only have one profile. To discover the profile that is currently associated with a login role, query the `profile` column of the `DBA_USERS` view.

**Parameters**

`name`

 The name of the role with which the specified profile will be associated.

`password`

 The password associated with the role.

`profile_name`

 The name of the profile that will be associated with the role.

`timestamp`

 The date and time at which the clause will be enforced. When specifying a value for `timestamp`, enclose the value in single-quotes.

**Notes**

For information about the Postgres-compatible clauses of the `ALTER USER` or `ALTER ROLE` command, see the PostgreSQL core documentation available at:

<https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/static/sql-alterrole.html>

**Examples**

The following command uses the `ALTER USER… PROFILE` command to associate a profile named `acctg` with a user named `john`:

```text
ALTER USER john PROFILE acctg_profile;
```

The following command uses the `ALTER ROLE… PROFILE` command to associate a profile named `acctg` with a user named `john`:

```text
ALTER ROLE john PROFILE acctg_profile;
```
