<div id="commit" class="registered_link"></div>

The `COMMIT` command makes all database updates made during the current transaction permanent, and ends the current transaction.

```
COMMIT [ WORK ];
```

The `COMMIT` command may be used within anonymous blocks, stored procedures, or functions. Within an SPL program, it may appear in the executable section and/or the exception section.

In the following example, the third `INSERT` command in the anonymous block results in an error. The effect of the first two `INSERT` commands are retained as shown by the first `SELECT` command. Even after issuing a `ROLLBACK` command, the two rows remain in the table as shown by the second `SELECT` command verifying that they were indeed committed.

!!! Note
    The `edb_stmt_level_tx` configuration parameter shown in the example below can be set for the entire database using the `ALTER DATABASE` command, or it can be set for the entire database server by changing it in the `postgresql.conf` file.

```text
\set AUTOCOMMIT off
SET edb_stmt_level_tx TO on;

BEGIN
    INSERT INTO dept VALUES (50, 'FINANCE', 'DALLAS');
    INSERT INTO dept VALUES (60, 'MARKETING', 'CHICAGO');
    COMMIT;
    INSERT INTO dept VALUES (70, 'HUMAN RESOURCES', 'CHICAGO');

    WHEN OTHERS THEN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('SQLERRM: ' || SQLERRM);
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('SQLCODE: ' || SQLCODE);
END;
