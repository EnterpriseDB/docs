Collections can be used to more efficiently process DML commands by passing all the values to be used for repetitive execution of a `DELETE, INSERT`, or `UPDATE` command in one pass to the database server rather than re-iteratively invoking the DML command with new values. The DML command to be processed in such a manner is specified with the `FORALL` statement. In addition, one or more collections are given in the DML command where different values are to be substituted each time the command is executed.

```text
FORALL <index> IN <lower_bound> .. <upper_bound>
  { <insert_stmt> | <update_stmt> | <delete_stmt> };
```

`index` is the position in the collection given in the `insert_stmt, update_stmt`, or `delete_stmt` DML command that iterates from the integer value given as `lower_bound` up to and including `upper_bound.`

If an exception occurs during any iteration of the `FORALL` statement, all updates that occurred since the start of the execution of the `FORALL` statement are automatically rolled back. This behavior is not compatible with Oracle databases. Oracle allows explicit use of the `COMMIT` or `ROLLBACK` commands to control whether or not to commit or roll back updates that occurred prior to the exception.

The `FORALL` statement creates a loop – each iteration of the loop increments the `index` variable (you typically use the `index` within the loop to select a member of a collection). The number of iterations is controlled by the `lower_bound .. upper_bound` clause. The loop is executes once for each integer between the `lower_bound` and `upper_bound` (inclusive) and the index is incremented by one for each iteration. For example:

`FORALL i IN 2 .. 5`

Creates a loop that executes four times – in the first iteration, the `index (i)` is set to the value `2`; in the second iteration, the index is set to the value `3`, and so on. The loop executes for the value `5` and then terminates.

The following example creates a table `(emp_copy)` that is an empty copy of the `emp` table. The example declares a type `(emp_tbl)` that is an array where each element in the array is of composite type, composed of the column definitions used to create the table, `emp`. The example also creates an index on the `emp_tbl` type.

`t_emp` is an associative array, of type `emp_tbl`. The `SELECT` statement uses the `BULK COLLECT INTO` command to populate the `t_emp` array. After the `t_emp` array is populated, the `FORALL` statement iterates through the values `(i)` in the `t_emp` array index and inserts a row for each record into `emp_copy`.

```text
CREATE TABLE emp_copy(LIKE emp);

DECLARE

    TYPE emp_tbl IS TABLE OF emp%ROWTYPE INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;

    t_emp emp_tbl;

BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM emp BULK COLLECT INTO t_emp;

    FORALL i IN t_emp.FIRST .. t_emp.LAST
     INSERT INTO emp_copy VALUES t_emp(i);

END;
```

The following example uses a `FORALL` statement to update the salary of three employees:

```text
DECLARE
    TYPE empno_tbl  IS TABLE OF emp.empno%TYPE INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;
    TYPE sal_tbl    IS TABLE OF emp.ename%TYPE INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;
    t_empno         EMPNO_TBL;
    t_sal           SAL_TBL;
BEGIN
    t_empno(1)  := 9001;
    t_sal(1)    := 3350.00;
    t_empno(2)  := 9002;
    t_sal(2)    := 2000.00;
    t_empno(3)  := 9003;
    t_sal(3)    := 4100.00;
    FORALL i IN t_empno.FIRST..t_empno.LAST
        UPDATE emp SET sal = t_sal(i) WHERE empno = t_empno(i);
END;

SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno > 9000;

 empno | ename  |   job   | mgr | hiredate |   sal   | comm | deptno
-------+--------+---------+-----+----------+---------+------+--------
  9001 | JONES  | ANALYST |     |          | 3350.00 |      |     40
  9002 | LARSEN | CLERK   |     |          | 2000.00 |      |     40
  9003 | WILSON | MANAGER |     |          | 4100.00 |      |     40
(3 rows)
```

The following example deletes three employees in a `FORALL` statement:

```text
DECLARE
    TYPE empno_tbl  IS TABLE OF emp.empno%TYPE INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;
    t_empno         EMPNO_TBL;
BEGIN
    t_empno(1)  := 9001;
    t_empno(2)  := 9002;
    t_empno(3)  := 9003;
    FORALL i IN t_empno.FIRST..t_empno.LAST
        DELETE FROM emp WHERE empno = t_empno(i);
END;

SELECT * FROM emp WHERE empno > 9000;

 empno | ename | job | mgr | hiredate | sal | comm | deptno
-------+-------+-----+-----+----------+-----+------+--------
(0 rows)
```
