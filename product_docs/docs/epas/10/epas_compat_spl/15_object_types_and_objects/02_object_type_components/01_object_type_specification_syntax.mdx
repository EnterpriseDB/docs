The following is the syntax of the object type specification:

```text
CREATE [ OR REPLACE ] TYPE <name>
  [ AUTHID { DEFINER | CURRENT_USER } ]
  { IS | AS } OBJECT
( { <attribute> { <datatype> | <objtype> | <collecttype> } }
    [, ...]
  [ <method_spec> ] [, ...]
  [ <constructor> ] [, ...]
) [ [ NOT ] { FINAL | INSTANTIABLE } ] ...;
```

where `method_spec` is the following:

```text
[ [ NOT ] { FINAL | INSTANTIABLE } ] ...
[ OVERRIDING ]
  <subprogram_spec>
```

where `subprogram_spec` is the following:

```text
{ MEMBER | STATIC }
{ PROCEDURE <proc_name>
    [ ( [  SELF [ IN | IN OUT ] <name> ]
        [, <parm1> [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] <datatype1>
                   [ DEFAULT <value1> ] ]
        [, <parm2> [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] <datatype2>
                   [ DEFAULT <value2> ]
        ] ...)
    ]
|
  FUNCTION <func_name>
    [ ( [  SELF [ IN | IN OUT ] <name> ]
        [, <parm1> [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] <datatype1>
                   [ DEFAULT <value1> ] ]
        [, <parm2> [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] <datatype2>
                   [ DEFAULT <value2> ]
        ] ...)
    ]
  RETURN <return_type>
}
```

where `constructor` is the following:

```text
CONSTRUCTOR <func_name>
  [ ( [  SELF [ IN | IN OUT ] <name> ]
      [, <parm1> [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] <datatype1>
                 [ DEFAULT <value1> ] ]
      [, <parm2> [ IN | IN OUT | OUT ] <datatype2>
                 [ DEFAULT <value2> ]
      ] ...)
  ]
RETURN self AS RESULT
```

!!! Note
    -   The `OR REPLACE` option cannot be currently used to add, delete, or modify the attributes of an existing object type. Use the `DROP TYPE` command to first delete the existing object type. The `OR REPLACE` option can be used to add, delete, or modify the methods in an existing object type.

    -   The PostgreSQL form of the `ALTER TYPE ALTER ATTRIBUTE` command can be used to change the data type of an attribute in an existing object type. However, the `ALTER TYPE` command cannot add or delete attributes in the object type.

`name` is an identifier (optionally schema-qualified) assigned to the object type.

If the `AUTHID` clause is omitted or `DEFINER` is specified, the rights of the object type owner are used to determine access privileges to database objects. If `CURRENT_USER` is specified, the rights of the current user executing a method in the object are used to determine access privileges.

`attribute` is an identifier assigned to an attribute of the object type.

`datatype` is a base data type.

`objtype` is a previously defined object type.

`collecttype` is a previously defined collection type.

Following the closing parenthesis of the `CREATE TYPE` definition, `[ NOT ] FINAL` specifies whether or not a subtype can be derived from this object type. `FINAL`, which is the default, means that no subtypes can be derived from this object type. Specify `NOT FINAL` if you want to allow subtypes to be defined under this object type.

!!! Note
    Even though the specification of `NOT FINAL` is accepted in the `CREATE TYPE` command, SPL does not currently support the creation of subtypes.

Following the closing parenthesis of the `CREATE TYPE` definition, `[ NOT ] INSTANTIABLE` specifies whether or not an object instance can be created of this object type. `INSTANTIABLE`, which is the default, means that an instance of this object type can be created. Specify `NOT INSTANTIABLE` if this object type is to be used only as a parent “template” from which other specialized subtypes are to be defined. If `NOT INSTANTIABLE` is specified, then `NOT FINAL` must be specified as well. If any method in the object type contains the `NOT INSTANTIABLE` qualifier, then the object type, itself, must be defined with `NOT INSTANTIABLE` and `NOT FINAL`.

!!! Note
    Even though the specification of `NOT INSTANTIABLE` is accepted in the `CREATE TYPE` command, SPL does not currently support the creation of subtypes.

`method_spec` denotes the specification of a member method or static method.

Prior to the definition of a method, `[ NOT ] FINAL` specifies whether or not the method can be overridden in a subtype. `NOT FINAL` is the default meaning the method can be overridden in a subtype.

Prior to the definition of a method specify `OVERRIDING` if the method overrides an identically named method in a supertype. The overriding method must have the same number of identically named method parameters with the same data types and parameter modes, in the same order, and the same return type (if the method is a function) as defined in the supertype.

Prior to the definition of a method, `[ NOT ] INSTANTIABLE` specifies whether or not the object type definition provides an implementation for the method. If `INSTANTIABLE` is specified, then the `CREATE TYPE BODY` command for the object type must specify the implementation of the method. If `NOT INSTANTIABLE` is specified, then the `CREATE TYPE BODY` command for the object type must not contain the implementation of the method. In this latter case, it is assumed a subtype contains the implementation of the method, overriding the method in this object type. If there are any `NOT INSTANTIABLE` methods in the object type, then the object type definition itself, must specify `NOT INSTANTIABLE` and `NOT FINAL` following the closing parenthesis of the object type specification. The default is `INSTANTIABLE`.

`subprogram_spec` denotes the specification of a procedure or function and begins with the specification of either `MEMBER` or `STATIC`. A member subprogram must be invoked with respect to a particular object instance while a static subprogram is not invoked with respect to any object instance.

`proc_name` is an identifier of a procedure. If the `SELF` parameter is specified, `name` is the object type name given in the `CREATE TYPE` command. If specified, `parm1, parm2, …` are the formal parameters of the procedure. `datatype1, datatype2, …` are the data types of `parm1, parm2, …` respectively. `IN, IN OUT`, and `OUT` are the possible parameter modes for each formal parameter. If none are specified, the default is `IN`. `value1, value2, …` are default values that may be specified for `IN` parameters.

Include the `CONSTRUCTOR` keyword and function definition to define a constructor function.

`func_name` is an identifier of a function. If the `SELF` parameter is specified, `name` is the object type name given in the `CREATE TYPE` command. If specified, `parm1, parm2, …` are the formal parameters of the function. `datatype1, datatype2, …` are the data types of `parm1, parm2, …` respectively. `IN, IN OUT`, and `OUT` are the possible parameter modes for each formal parameter. If none are specified, the default is `IN`. `value1, value2, …` are default values that may be specified for `IN` parameters. `return_type` is the data type of the value the function returns.

The following points should be noted about an object type specification:

-   There must be at least one attribute defined in the object type.

-   There may be none, one, or more methods defined in the object type.

-   For each member method there is an implicit, built-in parameter named `SELF`, whose data type is that of the object type being defined.

    `SELF` refers to the object instance that is currently invoking the method. `SELF` can be explicitly declared as an `IN` or `IN OUT` parameter in the parameter list (for example as `MEMBER FUNCTION (SELF IN OUT object_type ...)).`

    If `SELF` is explicitly declared, `SELF` must be the first parameter in the parameter list. If `SELF` is not explicitly declared, its parameter mode defaults to `IN OUT` for member procedures and `IN` for member functions.

-   A static method cannot be overridden (`OVERRIDING` and `STATIC` cannot be specified together in `method_spec`).

-   A static method must be instantiable (`NOT INSTANTIABLE` and `STATIC` cannot be specified together in `method_spec`).
