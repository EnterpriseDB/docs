title: "Deleting a Function"

---

<div id="deleting_a_function" class="registered_link"></div>

A function can be deleted from the database using the `DROP FUNCTION` command.

```text
DROP FUNCTION <name> [ (parameters) ];
```

Where `name` is the name of the function to be dropped.

!!! Note
    The specification of the parameter list is required in Advanced Server under certain circumstances. Oracle requires that the parameter list always be omitted.

The previously created function is dropped in this example:

```text
DROP FUNCTION simple_function;
```
