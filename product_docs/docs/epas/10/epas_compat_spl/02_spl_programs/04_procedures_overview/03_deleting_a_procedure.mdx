<div id="deleting_a_procedure" class="registered_link"></div>

A procedure can be deleted from the database using the `DROP PROCEDURE` command.

```text
DROP PROCEDURE <name>;
```

Where `name` is the name of the procedure to be dropped.

The previously created procedure is dropped in this example:

```text
DROP PROCEDURE simple_procedure;
```
