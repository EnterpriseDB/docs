`psql` is a command line client application that allows you to execute SQL commands and view the results. To open the `psql` client, the client must be in your search path. The executable resides in the `bin` directory, under your Advanced Server installation.

Use the following command and options to start the `psql` client:

```text
psql -d edb -U enterprisedb
```

Where:

`-d` specifies the database to which `psql` will connect.

`-U` specifies the identity of the database user that will be used for the session.

If you have performed an installation with the interactive installer, you can access the `psql` client by selecting `EDB-PSQL` from the `EDB Postgres` menu. When the client opens, provide connection information for your session.

For more information about using the command line client, see the PostgreSQL Core Documentation at:
