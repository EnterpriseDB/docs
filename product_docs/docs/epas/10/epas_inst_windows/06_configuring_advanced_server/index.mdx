You can easily update parameters that determine the behavior of Advanced Server and supporting components by modifying the following configuration files:

-   The `postgresql.conf` file determines the initial values of Advanced Server configuration parameters.
-   The `pg_hba.conf` file specifies your preferences for network authentication and authorization.
-   The `pg_ident.conf` file maps operating system identities (user names) to Advanced Server identities (roles) when using `ident`-based authentication.

For more information about Modifying the postgresql.conf file and Modifying the pg_hba.conf file, see the *EDB Postgres Advanced Server Guide* available from the EDB website at:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs>

You can use your editor of choice to open a configuration file, or navigate through a menu to open the file. On a Windows system, a link to each configuration file is available on the `Apps` menu.
