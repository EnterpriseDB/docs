<div id="command_summary" class="registered_link"></div>

The following sections contains a summary of EDB\*Plus commands.

## ACCEPT

The `ACCEPT` command displays a prompt and waits for the user’s keyboard input. The value input by the user is placed in the specified variable.

```text
ACC[EPT ] variable
```

The following example creates a new variable named `my_name`, accepts a value of John Smith, then displays the value using the `DEFINE` command.

```text
SQL> ACCEPT my_name
Enter value for my_name: John Smith
SQL> DEFINE my_name
DEFINE MY_NAME = "John Smith"
```

## APPEND

`APPEND` is a line editor command that appends the given text to the end of the current line in the SQL buffer.

```text
A[PPEND ] text
```

In the following example, a `SELECT` command is built-in the SQL buffer using the `APPEND` command. Note that two spaces are placed between the `APPEND` command and the `WHERE` clause in order to separate `dept` and `WHERE` by one space in the SQL buffer.

```text
SQL> APPEND SELECT * FROM dept
SQL> LIST
  1 SELECT * FROM dept
SQL> APPEND WHERE deptno = 10
SQL> LIST
  1 SELECT * FROM dept WHERE deptno = 10
```

## CHANGE

`CHANGE` is a line editor command performs a search-and-replace on the current line in the SQL buffer.

```text
C[HANGE ] FROM [ TO ]
```

If `TO/` is specified, the first occurrence of text `FROM` in the current line is changed to text `TO`. If `TO/` is omitted, the first occurrence of text `FROM` in the current line is deleted.

The following sequence of commands makes line 3 the current line, then changes the department number in the `WHERE` clause from 20 to 30.

```text
SQL> LIST
  1  SELECT empno, ename, job, sal, comm
  2  FROM emp
  3  WHERE deptno = 20
  4* ORDER BY empno
SQL> 3
  3* WHERE deptno = 20
SQL> CHANGE /20/30/
  3* WHERE deptno = 30
SQL> LIST
  1  SELECT empno, ename, job, sal, comm
  2  FROM emp
  3  WHERE deptno = 30
  4* ORDER BY empno
```

## CLEAR

The `CLEAR` command removes the contents of the SQL buffer, deletes all column definitions set with the `COLUMN` command, or clears the screen.

```text
CL[EAR ] [ BUFF[ER ] | SQL | COL[UMNS ] | SCR[EEN ] ]
```

`BUFFER | SQL`

 Clears the SQL buffer.

`COLUMNS`

 Removes column definitions.

`SCREEN`

 Clears the screen. This is the default if no options are specified.

## COLUMN

The `COLUMN` command controls output formatting. The formatting attributes set by using the `COLUMN` command remain in effect only for the duration of the current session.

```text
COL[UMN ]
  [ column
    { CLE[AR ] |
      { FOR[MAT ] spec |
        HEA[DING ] text |
        { OFF | ON }
      } [...]
    }
  ]
```

If the `COLUMN` command is specified with no subsequent options, formatting options for current columns in effect for the session are displayed.

If the `COLUMN` command is followed by a column name, then the column name may be followed by one of the following:

1.  No other options
2.  `CLEAR`
3.  Any combination of `FORMAT`, `HEADING`, and one of `OFF` or `ON`

`column`

 Name of a column in a table to which subsequent column formatting options are to apply. If no other options follow `column`, then the current column formatting options if any, of `column` are displayed.

`CLEAR`

 The `CLEAR` option reverts all formatting options back to their defaults for `column`. If the `CLEAR` option is specified, it must be the only option specified.

`spec`

 Format specification to be applied to `column`. For character columns, `spec` takes the following format:

`n`

 `n` is a positive integer that specifies the column width in characters within which to display the data. Data in excess of `n` will wrap around with the specified column width.

 For numeric columns, `spec` is comprised of the following elements.

| Element | Description                                |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `$`     | Display a leading dollar sign.             |
| `,`     | Display a comma in the indicated position. |
| `.`     | Marks the location of the decimal point.   |
| `0`     | Display leading zeros.                     |
| `9`     | Number of significant digits to display.   |

 If loss of significant digits occurs due to overflow of the format, then all #’s are displayed.

`text`

 Text to be used for the column heading of `column`.

`OFF | ON`

 If `OFF` is specified, formatting options are reverted back to their defaults, but are still available within the session. If `ON` is specified, the formatting options specified by previous `COLUMN` commands for `column` within the session are re-activated.

The following example shows the effect of changing the display width of the `job` column.

```text
SQL> SET PAGESIZE 9999
SQL> COLUMN job FORMAT A5
SQL> COLUMN job
COLUMN   JOB  ON
FORMAT   A5
wrapped
SQL> SELECT empno, ename, job FROM emp;

## CONNECT

Change the database connection to a different user and/or connect to a different database. There must be no white space between any of the parameters following the `CONNECT` command.

```text
CON[NECT] <username>[/<password>][@{<connectstring> | <variable> } ]
```

Where:

 `username` is a database username with which to connect to the database.

 `password` is the password associated with the specified `username`. If a `password` is not provided, but a password is required for authentication, a search is made for a password file, first in the home directory of the Linux operating system account invoking EDB\*Plus (or in the `%APPDATA%\postgresql\` directory for Windows) and then at the location specified by the `PGPASSFILE` environment variable. The password file is `.pgpass` on Linux hosts and `pgpass.conf` on Windows hosts. The following is an example on a Windows host:

```text
C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Roaming\postgresql\pgpass.conf
```

 If a password file cannot be located, or it does not have an entry matching the EDB\*Plus connection parameters, then EDB\*Plus will prompt for the password. For more information about password files, see the PostgreSQL core documentation at:

 <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/libpq-pgpass.html>

!!! Note
    When a password is not required, EDB\*Plus does not prompt for a password such as when the `trust` authentication method is specified in the `pg_hba.conf` file. 
     
For more information about the `pg_hba.conf` file and authentication methods, see the PostgreSQL core documentation at <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html>

 `connectstring` is the database connection string. See [Using EDB\*Plus](04_using_edb_plus/#using_edb_plus) for further information on the database connection string.

 `variable` is a variable defined in the `login.sql` file that contains a database connection string. The `login.sql` file can be found in the `edbplus` subdirectory of the Advanced Server home directory.

In the following example, the database connection is changed to database `edb` on the localhost at port `5445` with username `smith`.

```text
SQL> CONNECT smith/mypassword@localhost:5445/edb
Disconnected from EnterpriseDB Database.
Connected to EnterpriseDB 10.0.1 (localhost:5445/edb) AS smith
```

From within the session shown above, the connection is changed to username `enterprisedb`. Also note that the host defaults to the localhost, the port defaults to `5444` (which is not the same as the port previously used), and the database defaults to `edb`.

```text
SQL> CONNECT enterprisedb/password
Disconnected from EnterpriseDB Database.
Connected to EnterpriseDB 10.0.1 (localhost:5444/edb) AS enterprisedb
```

## DEFINE

The `DEFINE` command creates or replaces the value of a *user variable* (also called a *substitution variable*).

```text
DEF[INE ] [ variable [ = text ] ]
```

If the `DEFINE` command is given without any parameters, all current variables and their values are displayed.

If `DEFINE variable` is given, only `variable` is displayed with its value.

`DEFINE variable = text` assigns `text` to `variable.text` may be optionally enclosed within single or double quotation marks. Quotation marks must be used if `text` contains space characters.

The following example defines two variables, `dept` and `name`.

```text
SQL> DEFINE dept = 20
SQL> DEFINE name = 'John Smith'
SQL> DEFINE
DEFINE EDB = "localhost:5445/edb"
DEFINE DEPT = "20"
DEFINE NAME = "John Smith"
```

!!! Note
    The variable `EDB` is read from the `login.sql` file located in the `edbplus` subdirectory of the Advanced Server home directory.

## DEL

`DEL` is a line editor command that deletes one or more lines from the SQL buffer.

```text
DEL [ n | n m | n * | n L[AST ] | * | * n | * L[AST ] | L[AST ] ]
```

The parameters specify which lines are to be deleted from the SQL buffer. Two parameters specify the start and end of a range of lines to be deleted. If the `DEL` command is given with no parameters, the current line is deleted.

`n`

 n is an integer representing the `n`th line

`n m`

 `n` and `m` are integers where `m` is greater than `n` representing the `n`th through the `m`th lines

`*`

 Current line

`LAST`

 Last line

In the following example, the fifth and sixth lines containing columns `sal` and `comm`, respectively, are deleted from the `SELECT` command in the SQL buffer.

```text
SQL> LIST
  1  SELECT
  2    empno
  3   ,ename
  4   ,job
  5   ,sal
  6   ,comm
  7   ,deptno
  8* FROM emp
SQL> DEL 5 6
SQL> LIST
  1  SELECT
  2    empno
  3   ,ename
  4   ,job
  5   ,deptno
  6* FROM emp
```

## DESCRIBE

The `DESCRIBE` command displays:

-   A list of columns, column data types, and column lengths for a table or view
-   A list of parameters for a procedure or function
-   A list of procedures and functions and their respective parameters for a package

The `DESCRIBE` command will also display the structure of the database object referred to by a synonym. The syntax is:

```text
DESC[RIBE] [ schema.]object
```

`schema`

 Name of the schema containing the object to be described.

`object`

 Name of the table, view, procedure, function, or package to be displayed, or the synonym of an object.

## DISCONNECT

The `DISCONNECT` command closes the current database connection, but does not terminate EDB\*Plus.

```text
DISC[ONNECT ]
```

## EDIT

The `EDIT` command invokes an external editor to edit the contents of an operating system file or the SQL buffer.

```text
ED[IT ] [ filename[.ext ] ]
```

`filename[.ext ]`

 `filename` is the name of the file to open with an external editor. `ext` is the filename extension. If the filename extension is `sql`, then the `.sql` extension may be omitted when specifying `filename`. `EDIT` always assumes a `.sql` extension on filenames that are specified with no extension. If the filename parameter is omitted from the `EDIT` command, the contents of the SQL buffer are brought into the editor.

## EXECUTE

The `EXECUTE` command executes an SPL procedure from EDB\*Plus.

```text
EXEC[UTE ] spl_procedure [ ([ parameters ]) ]
```

`spl_procedure`

 The name of the SPL procedure to be executed.

`parameters`

 Comma-delimited list of parameters. If there are no parameters, then a pair of empty parentheses may optionally be specified.

## EXIT

The `EXIT` command terminates the EDB\*Plus session and returns control to the operating system. `QUIT` is a synonym for `EXIT`. Specifying no parameters is equivalent to `EXIT SUCCESS COMMIT`.

```text
{ EXIT | QUIT }
[ SUCCESS | FAILURE | WARNING | value | variable ]
[ COMMIT | ROLLBACK ]SUCCESS | FAILURE |WARNING]
```

Returns an operating system dependent return code indicating successful operation, failure, or warning for `SUCCESS, FAILURE`, and `WARNING`, respectively. The default is `SUCCESS`.

`value`

 An integer value that is returned as the return code.

`variable`

 A variable created with the `DEFINE` command whose value is returned as the return code.

`COMMIT | ROLLBACK`

 If `COMMIT` is specified, uncommitted updates are committed upon exit. If `ROLLBACK` is specified, uncommitted updates are rolled back upon exit. The default is `COMMIT`.

## GET

The `GET` command loads the contents of the given file to the SQL buffer.

```text
GET filename[.ext ] [ LIS[T ] | NOL[IST ] ]
```

`filename[.ext ]`

 `filename` is the name of the file to load into the SQL buffer. `ext` is the filename extension. If the filename extension is `sql`, then the `.sql` extension may be omitted when specifying `filename`. `GET` always assumes a `.sql` extension on filenames that are specified with no extension.

`LIST | NOLIST`

 If `LIST` is specified, the content of the SQL buffer is displayed after the file is loaded. If `NOLIST` is specified, no listing is displayed. The default is `LIST`.

## HELP

The `HELP` command obtains an index of topics or help on a specific topic. The question mark `(?)` is synonymous with specifying `HELP`.

```text
{ HELP | ? } { INDEX | topic }
```

`INDEX`

 Displays an index of available topics.

`topic`

 The name of a specific topic – e.g., an EDB\*Plus command, for which help is desired.

## HOST

The `HOST` command executes an operating system command from EDB\*Plus.

```text
HO[ST ] [os_command]
```

`os_command`

 The operating system command to be executed. If you do not provide an operating system command, EDB\*Plus pauses execution and opens a new shell prompt. When the shell exits, EDB\*Plus resumes execution.

## INPUT

The `INPUT` line editor command adds a line of text to the SQL buffer after the current line.

```text
I[NPUT ] text
```

The following sequence of `INPUT` commands constructs a `SELECT` command.

```text
SQL> INPUT SELECT empno, ename, job, sal, comm
SQL> INPUT FROM emp
SQL> INPUT WHERE deptno = 20
SQL> INPUT ORDER BY empno
SQL> LIST
  1 SELECT empno, ename, job, sal, comm
  2 FROM emp
  3 WHERE deptno = 20
  4* ORDER BY empno
```

## LIST

`LIST` is a line editor command that displays the contents of the SQL buffer.

```text
L[IST] [ n | n m | n * | n L[AST] | * | * n | * L[AST] | L[AST] ]
```

The buffer does not include a history of the EDB\*Plus commands.

`n`

 `n` represents the buffer line number.

`n m`

 `n m` displays a list of lines between `n` and `m`.

`n *`

 `n *` displays a list of lines that range between line `n` and the current line.

`n L[AST]`

 `n L[AST]` displays a list of lines that range from line `n` through the last line in the buffer.

`*`

 `*` displays the current line.

`* n`

 `* n` displays a list of lines that range from the current line through line `n`.

`* L[AST]`

 `* L[AST]` displays a list of lines that range from the current line through the last line.

`L[AST]`

 `L[AST]` displays the last line.

## PASSWORD

Use the `PASSWORD` command to change your database password.

```text
PASSW[ORD] [user_name]
```

You must have sufficient privileges to use the `PASSWORD` command to change another user's password. The following example demonstrates using the `PASSWORD` command to change the password for a user named `acctg`:

```text
SQL> PASSWORD acctg
Changing password for acctg
    New password:
    New password again:
Password successfully changed.
```

## PAUSE

The `PAUSE` command displays a message, and waits for the user to press `ENTER`.

```text
PAU[SE]  [optional_text]
```

`optional_text` specifies the text that will be displayed to the user. If the `optional_text` is omitted, Advanced Server will display two blank lines. If you double quote the `optional_text` string, the quotes will be included in the output.

## PROMPT

The `PROMPT` command displays a message to the user before continuing.

```text
PRO[MPT] [message_text]
```

`message_text` specifies the text displayed to the user. Double quote the string to include quotes in the output.

## QUIT

The `QUIT` command terminates the session and returns control to the operating system. `QUIT` is a synonym for `EXIT`.

```text
QUIT

[SUCCESS | FAILURE | WARNING | value | sub_variable]

[COMMIT | ROLLBACK]
```

The default value is `QUIT SUCCESS COMMIT`.

## REMARK

Use `REMARK` to include comments in a script.

```text
REM[ARK] [optional_text]
```

You may also use the following convention to include a comment:

```text
/*
 *  This is an example of a three line comment.
 */
```

## SAVE

Use the `SAVE` command to write the SQL Buffer to an operating system file.

```text
SAV[E] file_name
[CRE[ATE] | REP[LACE] | APP[END]]
```

`file_name`

 `file_name` specifies the name of the file (including the path) where the buffer contents are written. If you do not provide a file extension, `.sql` is appended to the end of the file name.

`CREATE`

 Include the `CREATE` keyword to create a new file. A new file is created *only* if a file with the specified name does not already exist. This is the default.

`REPLACE`

 Include the `REPLACE` keyword to specify that Advanced Server should overwrite an existing file.

`APPEND`

 Include the `APPEND` keyword to specify that Advanced Server should append the contents of the SQL buffer to the end of the specified file.

The following example saves the contents of the SQL buffer to a file named `example.sql`, located in the `temp` directory:

```text
SQL> SAVE C:\example.sql CREATE
File "example.sql" written.
```

## SET

Use the `SET` command to specify a value for a session level variable that controls EDB\*Plus behavior. The following forms of the `SET` command are valid:

**SET AUTOCOMMIT**

Use the `SET AUTOCOMMIT` command to specify commit behavior for Advanced Server transactions.

```text
SET AUTO[COMMIT]

{ON | OFF | IMMEDIATE | statement_count}
```

Please note that EDB\*Plus always automatically commits DDL statements.

`ON`

 Specify `ON` to turn `AUTOCOMMIT` behavior on.

`OFF`

 Specify `OFF` to turn `AUTOCOMMIT` behavior off.

`IMMEDIATE`

 `IMMEDIATE` has the same effect as `ON`.

`statement_count`

 Include a value for `statement_count` to instruct EDB\*Plus to issue a commit after the specified count of successful SQL statements.

**SET COLUMN SEPARATOR**

Use the `SET COLUMN SEPARATOR` command to specify the text that Advanced Server displays between columns.

```text
SET COLSEP column_separator
```

The default value of `column_separator` is a single space.

**SET ECHO**

Use the `SET ECHO` command to specify if SQL and EDB\*Plus script statements should be displayed onscreen as they are executed.

```text
SET ECHO {ON | OFF}
```

The default value is `OFF`.

**SET FEEDBACK**

The `SET FEEDBACK` command controls the display of interactive information after a SQL statement executes.

```text
SET FEED[BACK] {ON | OFF | row_threshold}
```

`row_threshold`

 Specify an integer value for `row_threshold`. Setting `row_threshold` to `0` is same as setting `FEEDBACK` to `OFF`. Setting `row_threshold` equal `1` effectively sets `FEEDBACK` to `ON`.

**SET FLUSH**

Use the `SET FLUSH` command to control display buffering.

```text
SET FLU[SH] {ON | OFF}
```

Set `FLUSH` to `OFF` to enable display buffering. If you enable buffering, messages bound for the screen may not appear until the script completes. Please note that setting `FLUSH` to `OFF` will offer better performance.

Set `FLUSH` to `ON` to disable display buffering. If you disable buffering, messages bound for the screen appear immediately.

**SET HEADING**

Use the `SET HEADING` variable to specify if Advanced Server should display column headings for `SELECT` statements.

```text
SET HEA[DING] {ON | OFF}
```

**SET HEAD SEPARATOR**

The `SET HEADSEP` command sets the new heading separator character used by the `COLUMN HEADING` command. The default is `'|'`.

```text
SET HEADS[EP]
```

**SET LINESIZE**

Use the `SET LINESIZE` command to specify the width of a line in characters.

```text
SET LIN[ESIZE] width_of_line
```

`width_of_line`

 The default value of `width_of_line` is `132`.

**SET NEWPAGE**

Use the `SET NEWPAGE` command to specify how many blank lines are printed after a page break.

```text
SET NEWP[AGE] lines_per_page
```

`lines_per_page`

 The default value of `lines_per_page` is `1`.

**SET NULL**

Use the `SET NULL` command to specify a string that is displayed to the user when a `NULL` column value is displayed in the output buffer.

```text
SET NULL null_string
```

**SET PAGESIZE**

Use the `SET PAGESIZE` command to specify the number of printed lines that fit on a page.

```text
SET PAGES[IZE] line_count
```

Use the `line_count` parameter to specify the number of lines per page.

**SET SQLCASE**

The `SET SQLCASE` command specifies if SQL statements transmitted to the server should be converted to upper or lower case.

```text
SET SQLC[ASE] {MIX[ED] | UP[PER] | LO[WER]}
```

`UPPER`

 Specify `UPPER` to convert the command text to uppercase.

`LOWER`

 Specify `LOWER` to convert the command text to lowercase.

`MIXED`

 Specify `MIXED` to leave the case of SQL commands unchanged. The default is `MIXED`.

**SET PAUSE**

The `SET PAUSE` command is most useful when included in a script; the command displays a prompt and waits for the user to press `Return`.

```text
SET PAU[SE] {ON | OFF}
```

If `SET PAUSE` is `ON`, the message `Hit ENTER to continue…` will be displayed before each command is executed.

**SET SPACE**

Use the `SET SPACE` command to specify the number of spaces to display between columns:

```text
SET SPACE number_of_spaces
```

**SET SQLPROMPT**

Use `SET SQLPROMPT` to set a value for a user-interactive prompt:

```text
SET SQLP[ROMPT] "prompt"
```

By default, `SQLPROMPT` is set to `"SQL> "`

**SET TERMOUT**

Use the `SET TERMOUT` command to specify if command output should be displayed onscreen.

```text
SET TERM[OUT] {ON | OFF}
```

**SET TIMING**

The `SET TIMING` command specifies if Advanced Server should display the execution time for each SQL statement after it is executed.

```text
SET TIMI[NG] {ON | OFF}
```

**SET TRIMSPOOL**

Use the `SET TRIMSPOOL` command to remove trailing spaces from each line in the output file specified by the `SPOOL` command.

```text
SET TRIMS[POOL] {ON | OFF}
```

The default value is `OFF`.

**SET VERIFY**

Specifies if both the old and new values of a SQL statement are displayed when a substitution variable is encountered.

```text
SET VER[IFY] { ON | OFF }
```

## SHOW

Use the `SHOW` command to display current parameter values.

```text
SHO[W] {ALL | parameter_name}
```

Display the current parameter settings by including the `ALL` keyword:

```Text
SQL> SHOW ALL
autocommit      OFF
colsep          " "
define          "&"
echo            OFF

```

Or display a specific parameter setting by including the `parameter_name` in the `SHOW` command:

```text
SQL> SHOW VERSION

## WHENEVER SQLERROR

The `WHENEVER SQLERROR` command provides error handling for SQL errors or PL/SQL block errors. The syntax is:

```text
WHENEVER SQLERROR
  {CONTINUE[COMMIT|ROLLBACK|NONE]
  |EXIT[SUCCESS|FAILURE|WARNING|n|sub_variable]
  [COMMIT|ROLLBACK]}
```

If Advanced Server encounters an error during the execution of a SQL command or PL/SQL block, EDB\*Plus performs the action specified in the `WHENEVER SQLERROR` command:

 Include the `CONTINUE` clause to instruct EDB\*Plus to perform the specified action before continuing.

 Include the `COMMIT` clause to instruct EDB\*Plus to `COMMIT` the current transaction before exiting or continuing.

 Include the `ROLLBACK` clause to instruct EDB\*Plus to `ROLLBACK` the current transaction before exiting or continuing.

 Include the `NONE` clause to instruct EDB\*Plus to continue without committing or rolling back the transaction.

 Include the `EXIT` clause to instruct EDB\*Plus to perform the specified action and exit if it encounters an error.

 Use the following options to specify a status code that EDB\*Plus will return before exiting:

```text
[SUCCESS|FAILURE|WARNING|n|sub_variable]
```

 Please note that EDB\*Plus supports substitution variables, but does not support bind variables.
