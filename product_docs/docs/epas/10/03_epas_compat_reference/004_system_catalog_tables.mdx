title: System Catalog Tables
---

The following system catalog tables contain definitions of database objects. The layout of the system tables is subject to change; if you are writing an application that depends on information stored in the system tables, it would be prudent to use an existing catalog view, or create a catalog view to isolate the application from changes to the system table.

## dual

dual is a single-row, single-column table that is provided for compatibility with Oracle databases only.

| Column | Type        | Modifiers | Description                      |
| ------ | ----------- | --------- | -------------------------------- |
| dummy  | VARCHAR2(1) |           | Provided for compatibility only. |

## edb\_dir

The edb\_dir table contains one row for each alias that points to a directory created with the create directory command. A directory is an alias for a pathname that allows a user limited access to the host file system.

You can use a directory to fence a user into a specific directory tree within the file system. For example, the UTL\_FILE package offers functions that permit a user to read and write files and directories in the host file system, but only allows access to paths that the database administrator has granted access to via a create directory command.

| Column   | Type        | Modifiers | Description                                                               |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| dirname  | "name"      | not null  | The name of the alias.                                                    |
| dirowner | oid         | not null  | The OID of the user that owns the alias.                                  |
| dirpath  | text        |           | The directory name to which access is granted.                            |
| diracl   | aclitem\[\] |           | The access control list that determines which users may access the alias. |

## edb\_password\_history

The edb\_password\_history table contains one row for each password change. The table is shared across all databases within a cluster.

| Column                | Type        | References     | Description                          |
| --------------------- | ----------- | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| passhistroleid        | oid         | pg\_authid.oid | The ID of a role.                    |
| passhistpassword      | text        |                | Role password in md5 encrypted form. |
| passhistpasswordsetat | timestamptz |                | The time the password was set.       |
