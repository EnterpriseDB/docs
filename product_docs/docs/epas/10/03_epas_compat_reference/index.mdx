Database Compatibility for Oracle means that an application runs in an Oracle environment as well as in the EDB Postgres Advanced Server (Advanced Server) environment with minimal or no changes to the application code.

This guide provides reference material about the compatibility features offered by Advanced Server:

-   SQL Language syntax support
-   Compatible Data Types
-   SQL Commands
-   Catalog Views
-   System Catalog Tables

Developing an application that is compatible with Oracle databases in the Advanced Server requires special attention to which features are used in the construction of the application. For example, developing a compatible application means selecting:

-   Data types to define the application’s database tables that are compatible with Oracle databases
-   SQL statements that are compatible with Oracle SQL
-   System and built-in functions for use in SQL statements and procedural logic that are compatible with Oracle databases
-   Stored Procedure Language (SPL) to create database server-side application logic for stored procedures, functions, triggers, and packages
-   System catalog views that are compatible with Oracle’s data dictionary

For detailed information about Advanced Server's compatibility features and extended functionality, please see the complete library of Advanced Server documentation, available at:

## What’s New

The following database compatibility for Oracle features have been added to Advanced Server 9.6 to create Advanced Server 10:

-   Advanced Server now supports usage of a composite type (created by the CREATE TYPE AS command) referenced by a field as its data type within a user-defined record type (declared with the TYPE IS RECORD statement). This record type containing a composite type can only be declared in a package specification or a package body. A composite type is not compatible with Oracle databases. However, composite types can generally be used within all SPL programs (functions, procedures, triggers, packages, etc.) as long as the composite type is not part of a record type (with the exception of packages). For more information on composite types, see Section <span class="underline">2.3.36</span>.

## Typographical Conventions Used in this Guide

Certain typographical conventions are used in this manual to clarify the meaning and usage of various commands, statements, programs, examples, etc. This section provides a summary of these conventions.

In the following descriptions a *term* refers to any word or group of words which may be language keywords, user-supplied values, literals, etc. A term’s exact meaning depends upon the context in which it is used.

-   *Italic font* introduces a new term, typically, in the sentence that defines it for the first time.
-   Fixed-width (mono-spaced) font is used for terms that must be given literally such as SQL commands, specific table and column names used in the examples, programming language keywords, etc. For example, SELECT \* FROM emp;
-   *Italic fixed-width font* is used for terms for which the user must substitute values in actual usage. For example, DELETE FROM *table_name*;
-   A vertical pipe | denotes a choice between the terms on either side of the pipe. A vertical pipe is used to separate two or more alternative terms within square brackets (optional choices) or braces (one mandatory choice).
-   Square brackets \[ ] denote that one or none of the enclosed term(s) may be substituted. For example, \[ a | b ], means choose one of “a” or “b” or neither of the two.
-   Braces {} denote that exactly one of the enclosed alternatives must be specified. For example, { a | b }, means exactly one of “a” or “b” must be specified.
-   Ellipses ... denote that the proceeding term may be repeated. For example, \[ a | b ] ... means that you may have the sequence, “b a a b a”.
