EnterpriseDB has enhanced ECPG (the PostgreSQL pre-compiler) to create ECPGPlus. ECPGPlus allows you to include Pro\*C compatible embedded SQL commands in C applications when connected to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server (Advanced Server) database. When you use ECPGPlus to compile an application, the SQL code is syntax-checked and translated into C.

ECPGPlus supports:
 - Oracle Dynamic SQL – Method 4 (ODS-M4).
 - Pro\*C compatible anonymous blocks.
 - A CALL statement compatible with Oracle databases.

As part of ECPGPlus's Pro\*C compatibility, you do not need to include the BEGIN DECLARE SECTION and END DECLARE SECTION directives.

***PostgreSQL Compatibility***

While most ECPGPlus statements will work with community PostgreSQL, the CALL statement, and the EXECUTE…END EXEC statement work only when the client application is connected to EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

## Typographical Conventions Used in this Guide

Certain typographical conventions are used in this manual to clarify the meaning and usage of various statements, statements, programs, examples, etc. This section provides a summary of these conventions.

In the following descriptions a *term* refers to any word or group of words that are language keywords, user-supplied values, literals, etc. A term’s exact meaning depends upon the context in which it is used.
 - *Italic font* introduces a new term, typically, in the sentence that defines it for the first time.
 - Fixed-width (mono-spaced) font is used for terms that must be given literally such as SQL statements, specific table and column names used in the examples, programming language keywords, etc. For example, SELECT \* FROM emp;
 - *Italic fixed-width font* is used for terms for which the user must substitute values in actual usage. For example, DELETE FROM *table\_name*;
 - A vertical pipe | denotes a choice between the terms on either side of the pipe. A vertical pipe is used to separate two or more alternative terms within square brackets (optional choices) or braces (one mandatory choice).
 - Square brackets \[ \] denote that one or none of the enclosed term(s) may be substituted. For example, \[ a | b \], means choose one of “a” or “b” or neither of the two.
 - Braces {} denote that exactly one of the enclosed alternatives must be specified. For example, { a | b }, means exactly one of “a” or “b” must be specified.
 - Ellipses ... denote that the proceeding term may be repeated. For example, \[ a | b \] ... means that you may have the sequence, “b a a b a”.
