title: Using the Procedural Languages
---


The Postgres procedural languages (PL/Perl, PL/Python, and PL/Java) are installed with by the Language Pack installer. You can also use an RPM package to add procedural language functionality to your Advanced Server installation. For more information about using an RPM package, please see the EDB Advanced Server Installation Guide, available at:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/product-documentation>

## PL/Perl

The PL/Perl procedural language allows you to use Perl functions in Postgres applications.

You must install PL/Perl in each database (or in a template database) before creating a PL/Perl function. Use the CREATE LANGUAGE command at the EDB-PSQL command line to install PL/Perl. Open the EDB-PSQL client, establish a connection to the database in which you wish to install PL/Perl, and enter the command:

CREATE LANGUAGE plperl;

The server confirms that the language is loaded with the response:

CREATE LANGUAGE;

You can now use a Postgres client application to access the features of the PL/Perl language. The following PL/Perl example creates a function named perl\_max that returns the larger of two integer values:

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION perl\_max (integer, integer) RETURNS integer AS
$$
if ($\_\[0\] \> $\_\[1\])
{ return $\_\[0\]; }
return $\_\[1\];
$$ LANGUAGE plperl;

Pass two values when calling the function:

SELECT perl\_max(1, 2);

The server returns:

perl\_max
\---------
2
(1 row)

For more information about using the Perl procedural language, consult the official Postgres documentation available at:

[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/plperl.html](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/plperl.html)

## PL/Python

The PL/Python procedural language allows you to create and execute functions written in Python within Postgres applications. The version of PL/Python used by Advanced Server and PostgreSQL is untrusted (plpython3u); it offers no restrictions on users to prevent potential security risks.

Install PL/Python in each database (or in a template database) before creating a PL/Python function. You can use the CREATE LANGUAGE command at the EDB-PSQL command line to install PL/Python. Use EDB-PSQL to connect to the database in which you wish to install PL/Python, and enter the command:

CREATE LANGUAGE plpython3u;

The server confirms that the language is loaded with the response:

CREATE LANGUAGE

After installing PL/Python in your database, you can use the features of the PL/Python language.

Please note: The indentation shown in the following example must be included as you enter the sample function in EDB-PSQL. The following PL/Python example creates a function named pymax that returns the larger of two integer values:

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pymax (a integer, b integer) RETURNS integer AS
$$
if a \> b:
return a
return b
$$ LANGUAGE plpython3u;

When calling the pymax function, pass two values as shown below:

SELECT pymax(12, 3);

The server returns:

pymax
\-------
12
(1 row)

For more information about using the Python procedural language, consult the official PostgreSQL documentation available at:

## PL/Tcl

The PL/Tcl procedural language allows you to use Tcl/Tk functions in applications.

You must install PL/Tcl in each database (or in a template database) before creating a PL/Tcl function. Use the CREATE LANGUAGE command at the EDB-PSQL command line to install PL/Tcl. Use the psql client to connect to the database in which you wish to install PL/Tcl, and enter the command:

CREATE LANGUAGE pltcl;

After creating the pltcl language, you can use the features of the PL/Tcl language from within your Postgres server.

The following PL/Tcl example creates a function named tcl\_max that returns the larger of two integer values:

CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION tcl\_max(integer, integer) RETURNS integer AS $$
if {\[argisnull 1\]} {
if {\[argisnull 2\]} { return\_null }
return $2
}
if {\[argisnull 2\]} { return $1 }
if {$1 \> $2} {return $1}
return $2
$$ LANGUAGE pltcl;

Pass two values when calling the function:

SELECT tcl\_max(1, 2);

The server returns:

tcl\_max
\--------
2
(1 row)

For more information about using the Tcl procedural language, consult the official Postgres documentation available at:
