The graphical installer is available from the EnterpriseDB website or via StackBuilder Plus.

## Invoking the Graphical Installer

On Windows, assume Administrator privileges, and double-click the installer icon; if prompted, provide the password associated with the Administrator account.

On a Linux host, assume superuser privileges, disable SELinux (if applicable), navigate into the directory in which the installer resides, and invoke the installer with the command:

> ./edb-languagepack-*version*.run

Where *version* identifies version and platform-specific installer information.

The installer Welcome window opens (see Figure 2.1).

*Figure 2.2 – The Language Pack Welcome window.*

The Ready to Install window (see Figure 2.2) displays the Language Pack installation directory:

> On Linux 32 or 64: /opt/edb/languagepack-10/
>
> On Windows 32: C:\\edb\\languagepack-10\\i386
>
> On Windows 64: C:\\edb\\languagepack-10\\x64
>
> On OSX: /Library/edb/languagepack-10

You cannot modify the installation directory. Click Next to continue.

The installer will inform you that the Language Pack installation has completed (see Figure 2.4); click Finish to exit the installer.

## Installing Language Pack with StackBuilder Plus

You can use StackBuilder Plus to download and invoke the Language Pack graphical installer. To open StackBuilder Plus, select the StackBuilder Plus menu item from the version-specific EDB Postgres sub-menu.

*Figure 2.5 – The StackBuilder Plus Welcome window.*

Select your server from the drop-down menu on the StackBuilder Plus Welcome window (see Figure 2.5) and click Next to continue.

Expand the Add-ons, tools and utilities node of the Categories tree control, and check the box to the left of EDB Language Pack; click Next to continue.

When prompted, provide your EnterpriseDB account credentials; if you have not registered for an account, use the provided link to register. StackBuilder Plus will confirm your package selection before downloading the installer. When the download completes, StackBuilder Plus will offer to invoke the installer for you, or to skip the installation until a more convenient time.

For details about using the graphical installer, see Section <span class="underline">2.1</span>.

## **Configuring Language Pack on an Advanced Server Host**

***Configuring Language Pack on Linux***

On Linux, the installer places the languages in:

> /opt/edb/languagepack-10/

If you install Language Pack before Advanced Server, the Advanced Server installer will detect the Language Pack installation, and set the paths in the plLanguages.config file for you.

If you are invoking the Advanced Server installer using the --extract-only option, or if you install Language Pack after installing Advanced Server, you must manually configure the installation. The Language Pack configuration file is named:

> /opt/edb/as10/etc/sysconfig/plLanguages.config

If you are installing Language Pack on a system that already hosts an Advanced Server installation, use your editor of choice to modify the plLanguages.config, changing the entries to include the locations of each language:

> EDB_PERL_VERSION=5.24
> EDB_PYTHON_VERSION=3.4
> EDB_TCL_VERSION=8.6
>
> EDB_PERL_PATH=/opt/edb/languagepack-10/Perl-5.24 EDB_PYTHON_PATH=/opt/edb/languagepack-10/Python-3.4 EDB_TCL_PATH=/opt/edb/languagepack-10/Tcl-8.6

After modifying the plLanguages.config file, restart the server for the changes to take effect.

***Configuring Language Pack on Windows***

On Windows, the Language Pack installer places the languages in:

> C:\\edb\\languagepack-10\\x64

After installing Language Pack, you must set the following variables:

> set PYTHONHOME=C:\\edb\\languagepack-10\\x64\\Python-3.4

Use the following commands to add Python, Perl and Tcl to your search path:

> set PATH= C:\\edb\\LanguagePack-10\\x64\\Python-3.4\\bin:
> C:\\edb\\LanguagePack-10\\x64\\Perl-5.24\\bin:
> C:\\edb\\LanguagePack-10\\x64\\Tcl-8.6\\bin:%PATH%

After setting the system-specific steps required to configure Language Pack on Windows, restart the Advanced Server database server.

## **Configuring Language Pack on a PostgreSQL Host**

After installing Language Pack on a PostgreSQL host, you must

**Configuring Language Pack on Linux:**

To simplify setting the value of PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH, you can create environment variables that identify the installation location:

> PERLHOME=/opt/edb/languagepack-10/Perl-5.24
> PYTHONHOME=/opt/edb/languagepack-10/Python-3.4
> TCLHOME=/opt/edb/languagepack-10/Tcl-8.6

Then, instruct the Python interpreter where to find Python:

> export PYTHONHOME

You can use the same environment variables when setting the value of PATH:

> export PATH=$PYTHONHOME/bin:$PERLHOME/bin:$TCLHOME/bin:$PATH
> export PATH=/opt/edb/languagepack-10/Python-3.4/bin:

Lastly, use the variables to tell Linux where to find the shared libraries:

> export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=
> $PYTHONHOME/lib:
> $PERLHOME/lib/CORE:
> $TCLHOME/lib:
> $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

**Configuring Language Pack on Windows**

***On 32-bit Windows:***

If you are using 32-bit Windows, you must tell the Python interpreter where to find Python:

> set PYTHONHOME=C:\\edb\\languagepack-10\\i386\\Python-3.4

Then, set the path to the Language Pack installation:

> SET PATH=C:\\edb\\languagepack-10\\i386\\Python-3.4;
> C:\\edb\\languagepack-10\\i386\\Perl-5.24\\bin;
> C:\\edb\\languagepack-10\\i386\\Tcl-8.6\\bin;%PATH%

***On 64-bit Windows:***

After installing Language Pack, you must tell the Python interpreter where to find Python:

set PYTHONHOME=C:\\edb\\languagepack-10\\x64\\Python-3.3

Then, use the following commands to add Language Pack to your search path:

set PATH= C:\\edb\\LanguagePack-10\\x64\\Python-3.3\\bin: C:\\edb\\LanguagePack-10\\x64\\Perl-5.20\\bin: C:\\edb\\LanguagePack-10\\x64\\Tcl-8.5\\bin:%PATH%

After setting the system-specific steps required to configure Language Pack on Windows, restart the database server.

**Configuring Language Pack on OSX**

To simplify setting the value of PATH or LD_LIBRARY_PATH, you can create environment variables that identify the installation location:

> PERLHOME=/Library/edb/languagepack-10/Perl-5.24 PYTHONHOME=/Library/edb/languagepack-10/Python-3.4 TCLHOME=/Library/edb/languagepack-10/Tcl-8.6

Then, instruct the Python interpreter where to find Python:

> export PYTHONHOME

You can use the same environment variables when setting the value of PATH:

> export PATH=$PYTHONHOME/bin:
> $PERLHOME/bin:
> $TCLHOME/bin:$PATH

Lastly, use the variables to tell Linux where to find the shared libraries:

> export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PYTHONHOME/lib:
> $PERLHOME/lib/CORE:$TCLHOME/lib:
> $DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
