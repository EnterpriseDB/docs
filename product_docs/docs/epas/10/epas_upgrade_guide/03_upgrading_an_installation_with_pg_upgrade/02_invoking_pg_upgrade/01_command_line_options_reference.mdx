`pg_upgrade` accepts the following command line options; each option is available in a long form or a short form:

`-b path_to_old_bin_directory`  
`--old-bindir path_to_old_bin_directory`

Use the `-b` or `--old-bindir` keyword to specify the location of the old cluster's executable directory.

`-B path_to_new_bin_directory`  
`--new-bindir path_to_new_bin_directory`

Use the `-B` or `--new-bindir` keyword to specify the location of the new cluster's executable directory.

`-c`  
`--check`

Include the `-c` or `--check` keyword to specify that `pg_upgrade` should perform a consistency check on the old and new cluster without performing a version upgrade.

`-d path_to_old_data_directory`  
`--old-datadir path_to_old_data_directory`

Use the `-d` or `--old-datadir` keyword to specify the location of the old cluster's `data` directory.

`-D path_to_new_data_directory`  
`--new-datadir path_to_new_data_directory`

Use the `-D` or `--new-datadir` keyword to specify the location of the new cluster's `data` directory.

Data that is stored in user-defined tablespaces is not copied to the new cluster; it stays in the same location in the file system, but is copied into a subdirectory whose name reflects the version number of the new cluster. To manually relocate files that are stored in a tablespace after upgrading, you must move the files to the new location and update the symbolic links (located in the `pg_tblspc` directory under your cluster's `data` directory) to point to the files.

`-j`  
`--jobs`

Include the `-j` or `--jobs` keyword to specify the number of simultaneous processes or threads to use during the upgrade.

`-k`  
`--link`

Include the `-k` or `--link` keyword to create a hard link from the new cluster to the old cluster. See [Linking versus Copying](../01_performing_an_upgrade/01_linking_versus_copying/#linking_versus_copying) for more information about using a symbolic link.

`-o options`  
`--old-options options`

Use the `-o` or `--old-options` keyword to specify options that will be passed to the old `postgres` command. Enclose options in single or double quotes to ensure that they are passed as a group.

`-O options`  
`--new-options options`

Use the `-O` or `--new-options` keyword to specify options to be passed to the new `postgres` command. Enclose options in single or double quotes to ensure that they are passed as a group.

`-p old_port_number`  
`--old-port old_port_number`

Include the `-p` or `--old-port` keyword to specify the port number of the Advanced Server installation that you are upgrading.

`-P new_port_number`  
`--new-port new_port_number`

Include the `-P` or `--new-port` keyword to specify the port number of the new Advanced Server installation.

!!! Note
    If the original Advanced Server installation is using port number `5444` when you invoke the Advanced Server 10 installer, the installer will recommend using listener port `5445` for the new installation of Advanced Server.

`-r`  
`--retain`

During the upgrade process, `pg_upgrade` creates four append-only log files; when the upgrade is completed, `pg_upgrade` deletes these files. Include the `-r` or `--retain` option to specify that the server should retain the `pg_upgrade` log files.

`-U user_name`  
`--username user_name`

Include the `-U` or `--username` keyword to specify the name of the Advanced Server database superuser. The same superuser must exist in both clusters.

`-v`  
`--verbose`

Include the `-v` or `--verbose` keyword to enable verbose output during the upgrade process.

`-V`  
`--version`

Use the `-V` or `--version` keyword to display version information for `pg_upgrade`.

`-?`  
`-h`  
`--help`

Use `-?, -h,` or `--help` options to display `pg_upgrade` help information.
