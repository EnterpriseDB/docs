The following features have been changed in EDB Postgres Advanced Server 9.6 to create Advanced Server 10:

-   Advanced Server now includes the following enhancements for EDB Audit Logging: 1) Separate auditing for each DDL type allows the specification of individual DDL commands (`CREATE`, `ALTER`, or `DROP`) with or without their object types (for example, `TABLE`, `VIEW`, `SEQUENCE`, etc.) for which audit logging is to occur. This refines the types of SQL statements recorded in the audit log file. 2) Separate auditing for each DML type allows the specification of individual DML commands (`INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `TRUNCATE`) for which audit logging is to occur. This provides the same benefit as separate DDL auditing. 3) Statements to be audited can now be determined by: a) the database in which auditing is to occur, b) the role running the session, or c) the combination of the role and the database. This is accomplished by setting the `edb_audit_statement` configuration parameter with the `ALTER DATABASE`, `ALTER ROLE`, or `ALTER ROLE IN DATABASE`. 4) *Command tags* identify the SQL command that was executed, and thus aids in scanning the audit log to find entries related to certain SQL commands. 5) Addition of the `edb_audit_destination` parameter specifies whether audit logging is to be recorded in the default location under the database cluster or to be handled by the *syslog* process. For more information, see [EDB Audit Logging](../03_database_administration/05_edb_audit_logging/#edb_audit_logging).
-   Advanced Server now includes the `edb_log_every_bulk_value` configuration parameter, which affects both Advanced Server logging and EDB Audit Logging. Logging a single message for the entire bulk process is now the default option as opposed to logging every statement involved in bulk processing. For more information, see [Audit Logging Configuration Parameters](../03_database_administration/05_edb_audit_logging/01_audit_logging_configuration_parameters/#audit_logging_configuration_parameters).
-   Advanced Server now includes the *EDB Clone Schema* extension, which allows you to make a copy of a schema with its database objects from a given database, and to insert it into another database, or into the same database (with a different schema name). The cloning functionality can be run in both an online mode or a non-blocking, background job mode. Using a background job frees up access to your terminal while the cloning operation is in progress. Multiple background worker processes can be used for the cloning process to shorten the amount of time to complete the operation. For more information, see [EDB Clone Schema](../14_edb_clone_schema/#edb_clone_schema).
-   Advanced Server now provides the `pg_prewarm` module, which implements the `autoprewarm` background worker. The `autoprewarm` worker process automatically dumps shared buffers to disk before a shutdown. It then prewarms the shared buffers the next time the server is started, meaning it loads blocks from the disk back into the buffer pool. This shortens the warm up times after the server has been restarted. For more information, see [Top Performance Related Parameters](../03_database_administration/01_configuration_parameters/03_configuration_parameters_by_functionality/01_top_performance_related_parameters/16_pg_prewarm.autoprewarm/#pg_prewarm.autoprewarm).
-   Advanced Server now provides the `--wal-segsize` option for the `initdb` utility program. This provides the capability to specify the WAL segment file size when creating a database cluster instead of using the default size of 16 MB. For more information, see [Unicode Collation Algorithm](../03_database_administration/06_unicode_collation_algorithm/#customizable_wal_segment_file_size).
