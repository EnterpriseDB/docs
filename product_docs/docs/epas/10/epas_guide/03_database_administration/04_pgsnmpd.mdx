`pgsnmpd` is an SNMP agent that can return hierarchical information about the current state of Advanced Server on a Linux system. `pgsnmpd` is distributed and installed using the `edb-asxx-pgsnmpd` RPM package where `xx` is the Advanced Server version number. The `pgsnmpd` agent can operate as a stand-alone SNMP agent, as a pass-through sub-agent, or as an AgentX sub-agent.

After installing Advanced Server, you will need to update the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` variable. Use the command:

```text
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/edb/as11/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

This command does not persistently alter the value of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Consult the documentation for your distribution of Linux for information about persistently setting the value of `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

The examples that follow demonstrate the simplest usage of `pgsnmpd`, implementing read only access. `pgsnmpd` is based on the net-snmp library; for more information about net-snmp, visit:

<http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/>

## Configuring pgsnmpd

The `pgsnmpd` configuration file is named `snmpd.conf`. For information about the directives that you can specify in the configuration file, please review the `snmpd.conf` man page (`man snmpd.conf`).

You can create the configuration file by hand, or you can use the `snmpconf` perl script to create the configuration file. The perl script is distributed with net-snmp package.

net-snmp is an open-source package available from:

<http://www.net-snmp.org/>

To use the snmpconf configuration file wizard, download and install net-snmp. When the installation completes, open a command line and enter:

```text
snmpconf
```

When the configuration file wizard opens, it may prompt you to read in an existing configuration file. Enter `none` to generate a new configuration file (not based on a previously existing configuration file).

`snmpconf` is a menu-driven wizard. Select menu item `1: snmpd.conf` to start the configuration wizard. As you select each top-level menu option displayed by `snmpconf`, the wizard walks through a series of questions, prompting you for information required to build the configuration file. When you have provided information in each of the category relevant to your system, enter `Finished` to generate a configuration file named `snmpd.conf`. Copy the file to:

```text
/usr/edb/as11/share/
```

## Setting the Listener Address

By default, `pgsnmpd` listens on port `161`. If the listener port is already being used by another service, you may receive the following error:

```text
Error opening specified endpoint "udp:161".
```

You can specify an alternate listener port by adding the following line to your `snmpd.conf` file:

```text
agentaddress $host_address:2000
```

The example instructs `pgsnmpd` to listen on UDP port `2000`, where `$host_address` is the IP address of the server (e.g., `127.0.0.1`).


## Invoking pgsnmpd

Ensure that an instance of Advanced Server is up and running (`pgsnmpd` will connect to this server). Open a command line and assume superuser privileges, before invoking pgsnmpd with a command that takes the following form:

```text
POSTGRES_INSTALL_HOME/bin/pgsnmpd -b
  -c POSTGRES_INSTALL_HOME/share/snmpd.conf
  -C "user=enterprisedb dbname=edb password=safe_password
      port=5444"
```

Where `POSTGRES_INSTALL_HOME` specifies the Advanced Server installation directory.

Include the `-b` option to specify that `pgsnmpd` should run in the background.

Include the `-c` option, specifying the path and name of the `pgsnmpd` configuration file.

Include connection information for your installation of Advanced Server (in the form of a `libpq` connection string) after the `-C` option.

## Viewing pgsnmpd Help

Include the `--help` option when invoking the `pgsnmpd` utility to view other `pgsnmpd` command line options:

```text
pgsnmpd --help
  Version PGSQL-SNMP-Ver1.0
  usage: pgsnmpd [-s] [-b] [-c FILE ] [-x address ] [-g] [-C "Connect String"]
     -s : run as AgentX sub-agent of an existing snmpd process
     -b : run in the background
     -c : configuration file name
     -g : use syslog
     -C : libpq connection string
     -x : address:port of a network interface
     -V : display version strings
```

## Requesting Information from pgsnmpd

You can use `net-snmp` commands to query the `pgsnmpd` service. For example:

```text
snmpgetnext -v 2c -c public localhost .1.3.6.1.4.1.5432.1.4.2.1.1.0
```

In the above example:

`-v 2c` option instructs the `snmpgetnext` client to send the request in SNMP version 2c format.

`-c public` specifies the community name.

`localhost` indicates the host machine running the `pgsnmpd` server.

`.1.3.6.1.4.1.5432.1.4.2.1.1.0` is the identity of the requested object. To see a list of all databases, increment the last digit by one (e.g. .1.1, .1.2, .1.3 etc.).

The encodings required to query any given object are defined in the MIB (Management Information Base). An SNMP client can monitor a variety of servers; the server type determines the information exposed by a given server. Each SNMP server describes the exposed data in the form of a MIB (Management information base). By default, pgsnmpd searches for MIB's in the following locations:

```text
/usr/share/snmp/mibs

$HOME/.snmp/mibs
```
