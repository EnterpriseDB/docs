**Required Authorization to Activate:** EPAS service account

This parameter controls whether or not the database server should run `autoprewarm`, which is a background worker process that automatically dumps shared buffers to disk before a shutdown. It then `prewarms` the shared buffers the next time the server is started, meaning it loads blocks from the disk back into the buffer pool.

The advantage is that it shortens the warm up times after the server has been restarted by loading the data that has been dumped to disk before shutdown.

If `pg_prewarm.autoprewarm` is set to on, the `autoprewarm` worker is enabled. If the parameter is set to off, `autoprewarm` is disabled. The parameter is on by default.

Before `autoprewarm` can be used, you must add `$libdir/pg_prewarm` to the libraries listed in the `shared_preload_libraries` configuration parameter of the `postgresql.conf` file as shown by the following example:

```text
shared_preload_libraries = '$libdir/dbms_pipe,$libdir/edb_gen,$libdir/dbms_aq,$libdir/pg_prewarm'
```

After modifying the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter, restart the database server after which the `autoprewarm` background worker is launched immediately after the server has reached a consistent state.

The `autoprewarm` process will start loading blocks that were previously recorded in `$PGDATA/autoprewarm.blocks` until there is no free buffer space left in the buffer pool. In this manner, any new blocks that were loaded either by the recovery process or by the querying clients, are not replaced.

Once the `autoprewarm` process has finished loading buffers from disk, it will periodically dump shared buffers to disk at the interval specified by the `pg_prewarm.autoprewarm_interval` parameter. See the [pg_prewarm.autoprewarm_interval](17_pg_prewarm.autoprewarm_interval/#pg_prewarm_autoprewarm_interval) for information on the `autoprewarm` background worker. Upon the next server restart, the `autoprewarm` process will prewarm shared buffers with the blocks that were last dumped to disk.
