Sets the fillfactor for a table when the `FILLFACTOR` storage parameter is omitted from a `CREATE TABLE` command.

The fillfactor for a table is a percentage between 10 and 100. 100 (complete packing) is the default. When a smaller `fillfactor` is specified, `INSERT` operations pack table pages only to the indicated percentage; the remaining space on each page is reserved for updating rows on that page. This gives `UPDATE` a chance to place the updated copy of a row on the same page as the original, which is more efficient than placing it on a different page. For a table whose entries are never updated, complete packing is the best choice, but in heavily updated tables smaller fillfactors are appropriate.
