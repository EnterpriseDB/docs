If WAL disk usage stays below the value specified by `min_wal_size`, old WAL files are recycled for future use at a checkpoint, rather than removed. This ensures that enough WAL space is reserved to handle spikes in WAL usage (like when running large batch jobs). This parameter can only be set in the `postgresql.conf` file or on the server command line.
