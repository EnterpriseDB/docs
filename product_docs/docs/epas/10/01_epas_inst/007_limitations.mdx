title: Limitations
---

-   The pg_upgrade utility cannot upgrade a partitioned table if a foreign key refers to the partitioned table.
-   If you are upgrading from the version 9.4 server or a lower version of Advanced Server, and you use partitioned tables that include a SUBPARTITION BY clause, you must use pg_dump and pg_restore to upgrade an existing Advanced Server installation to a later version of Advanced Server. To upgrade, you must:

1.  Use pg_dump to preserve the content of the subpartitioned table.
2.  Drop the table from the Advanced Server 9.4 database or a lower version of Advanced Server database.
3.  Use pg_upgrade to upgrade the rest of the Advanced Server database to a more recent version.
4.  Use pg_restore to restore the subpartitioned table to the latest upgraded Advanced Server database.
