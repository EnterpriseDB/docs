title: Uninstalling Advanced Server
---


Note that after uninstalling Advanced Server, the cluster data files remain intact and the service user persists. You may manually remove the cluster data and service user from the system.

## Uninstalling an RPM Package

You can use variations of the rpm or yum command to remove installed packages. Note that removing a package does not damage the Advanced Server data directory.

Include the -e option when invoking the rpm command to remove an installed package; the command syntax is:

> rpm -e package\_name

Where *package\_name* is the name of the package that you would like to remove.

You can use the yum remove command to remove a package installed by yum. To remove a package, open a terminal window, assume superuser privileges, and enter the command:

> yum remove *package\_name*

Where *package\_name* is the name of the package that you would like to remove.

Note: yum and RPM will not remove a package that is required by another package. If you attempt to remove a package that satisfies a package dependency, yum or RPM will provide a warning.

## Using Advanced Server Uninstallers at the Command Line

The Advanced Server interactive installer creates an uninstaller that you can use to remove Advanced Server or components bundled with the installer (pgAdmin 4, StackBuilder Plus, or the command line tools). If you uninstall an Advanced Server component, the remainder of the Advanced Server installation will remain intact.

On Linux, the uninstaller is created in /opt/edb/as10. To open the uninstaller, assume superuser privileges, navigate into the directory that contains the uninstaller, and enter:

./uninstall-edb-as10-server

On Windows, the uninstaller is created in C:\\Program Files\\edb\\as10. To open the uninstaller, assume superuser privileges, navigate into the directory that contains the uninstaller, and enter:

uninstall-edb-as10-server.exe

The uninstaller opens as shown in Figure 8.1.

*Figure 8.3 – Acknowledge that dependent components are removed first.*

If you choose to remove components that are dependent on Advanced Server, those components will be removed first; click Yes to acknowledge that you wish to continue (see Figure 8.3).

When the uninstaller completes, a popup confirms that the data directory and service account have not been removed (see Figure 8.4).

When the uninstallation is complete, an Info dialog opens to confirm that Advanced Server (and/or its components) has been removed (see Figure 8.5).
