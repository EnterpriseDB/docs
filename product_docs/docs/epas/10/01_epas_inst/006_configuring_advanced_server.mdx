title: Configuring Advanced Server
---

Unless otherwise noted, the commands and paths noted in the following section assume that you have performed an installation with the interactive installer.

You can easily update parameters that determine the behavior of Advanced Server and supporting components by modifying the following configuration files:

-   The postgresql.conf file determines the initial values of Advanced Server configuration parameters.
-   The pg_hba.conf file specifies your preferences for network authentication and authorization.
-   The pg_ident.conf file maps operating system identities (user names) to Advanced Server identities (roles) when using ident-based authentication.

You can use your editor of choice to open a configuration file, or navigate through a menu to open the file:

-   On a Windows system, a link to each configuration file is available on the Apps menu.
-   To update configuration files in Linux, navigate through the EDB Postgres menu selection on the Applications menu to the Advanced Server 10 menu; use the Expert Configuration menu to select the configuration file that you would like to edit (see Figure 6.1).

## Modifying the postgresql.conf File

Configuration parameters in the postgresql.conf file specify server behavior with regards to auditing, authentication, encryption, and other behaviors. The postgresql.conf file resides in the data directory under your Advanced Server installation.

!\[image](./images/image55.png)

*Figure 6.2 - The postgresql.conf file.*

Parameters that are preceded by a pound sign (#) are set to their default value (as shown in the parameter setting). To change a parameter value, remove the pound sign and enter a new value. After setting or changing a parameter, you must either *reload* or *restart* the server for the new parameter value to take effect.

Within the postgresql.conf file, some parameters contain comments that indicate change requires restart (see Figure 6.2). To view a list of the parameters that require a server restart, execute the following query at the EDB-PSQL command line (see Figure 6.3):

SELECT name FROM pg_settings WHERE context = 'postmaster';

!\[image](./images/image56.png)

*Figure 6.3 - Configuration parameters that require a server restart.*

If you are changing a parameter that requires a server restart, see Section <span class="underline">5.1</span>, *Starting and Stopping Advanced Server* for information about restarting Advanced Server.

On a Linux system, you can reload the system configuration parameter values by navigating through the EDB Postgres menu to the Advanced Server 10 menu; then, navigate through the Expert Configuration menu, selecting Reload Configuration. Reloading the configuration parameters does not require Advanced Server users to log out of their current Advanced Server sessions.

On a Windows system, you will find the Reload Configuration menu selection on the Apps menu.

## Modifying the pg_hba.conf File

Entries in the pg_hba.conf file specify the authentication method or methods that the server will use when authenticating connecting clients. Before connecting to the server, you may be required to modify the authentication properties specified in the pg_hba.conf file.

When you invoke the initdb utility to create a cluster, initdb creates a pg_hba.conf file for that cluster that specifies the type of authentication required from connecting clients.

The default authentication configuration specified in the pg_hba.conf file is:

\# TYPE DATABASE USER ADDRESS METHOD

\# "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only

local all all md5

\# IPv4 local connections:

host all all 127.0.0.1/32 md5

\# IPv6 local connections:

host all all ::1/128 md5

\# Allow replication connections from localhost, by a user with the

\# replication privilege.

\#local replication enterprisedb md5

\#host replication enterprisedb 127.0.0.1/32 md5

\#host replication enterprisedb ::1/128 md5

Appropriate authetication methods provide protection and security. Please consult the PostgreSQL documentation for details about authentication options:

[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/auth-methods.html](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/auth-methods.html)

To modify the pg_hba.conf file, open the file with your choice of editor. After modifying the authentication settings in the pg_hba.conf file, use the services utility (Windows), or use the following command to restart the server and apply the changes:

On Linux 6.x:

service edb-as-10 restart

On Linux 7.x:

systemctl restart edb-as-10

For more information about modifying the pg_hba.conf file, see the PostgreSQL Core Documentation at:

## Setting Advanced Server Environment Variables

The graphical installers provide a script that simplifies the task of setting environment variables, allowing a user to more easily invoke client applications at the command line. The script sets the environment variables for your current shell session; when your shell session ends, the environment variables are destroyed. You may wish to invoke pgplus_env or pg_env from your system-wide shell startup script, so that environment variables are automatically defined for each shell session.

The pgplus_env script is created during the Advanced Server installation process and reflects the choices made during installation. To invoke the script, open a command line and enter:

On Linux:

source /opt/edb/as10/pgplus_env.sh

On Windows:

C:\\Program Files\\edb\\10AS\\pgplus_env.bat

As the pgplus_env.sh script executes (on Linux), it sets the following environment variables:

> export PATH=/opt/edb/as10/bin:$PATH

> export EDBHOME=/opt/edb/as10

> export PGDATA=/opt/edb/as10/data

> export PGDATABASE=edb

\# export PGUSER=enterprisedb

> export PGPORT=5444

> export PGLOCALEDIR=/opt/edb/as10/share/locale

As the pgplus_env.bat script executes (on Windows), it sets the following environment variables:

PATH="C:\\Program Files\\edb\\as10\\bin";%PATH%

EDBHOME=C:\\Program Files\\edb\\as10

PGDATA=C:\\Program Files\\edb\\as10\\data

PGDATABASE=edb

REM @SET PGUSER=enterprisedb

PGPORT=5444

PGLOCALEDIR=C:\\Program Files\\edb\\as10\\share\\locale

If you have used an installer created by EnterpriseDB to install PostgreSQL, the pg_env script performs the same function. To invoke the pg_env script, open a command line, and enter:

On Linux:

source /opt/PostgreSQL/10/pg_env.sh

On Windows:

C:\\Progra~1\\PostgreSQL\\10\\pg_env.bat

As the pg_env.sh script executes (on Linux), it sets the following environment variables:

PATH=/home/opt/PostgreSQL/10/bin:$PATH

PGDATA=/home/opt/PostgreSQL/10/data

PGDATABASE=postgres

PGUSER=postgres

PGPORT=5432

PGLOCALEDIR=/home/opt/PostgreSQL/10/share/locale

MANPATH=$MANPATH:/home/opt/PostgreSQL/10/share/man

As the pg_env.bat script executes (on Windows), it sets the following environment variables:

PATH="C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\10\\bin";%PATH%

PGDATA=C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\10\\data

PGDATABASE=postgres

PGUSER=postgres

PGPORT=5432

PGLOCALEDIR=C:\\Program Files\\PostgreSQL\\10\\share\\locale

## Connecting to Advanced Server with psql

psql is a command line client application that allows you to execute SQL commands and view the results. To open the edb-psql client, the client must be in your search path. The executable resides in the bin directory, under your Advanced Server installation.

On Linux:

/opt/edb/as10/bin/psql

On Windows:

C:\\Program Files\\edb\\as10\\bin\\psql

Use the following command and command options to start the psql client:

psql -d edb -U enterprisedb

!\[image](./images/image57.png)

*Figure 6.4 - Connecting to the server.*

Where:

\-d specifies the database to which psql will connect;

\-U specifies the identity of the database user that will be used for the session.

If you have performed an installation with the interactive installer, you can access the psql client through the Applications or Start menu. Navigate through the EDB Postgres menu to the Advanced Server 10 menu; then, navigate through the Run SQL Command Line menu, selecting EDB-PSQL. When the Terminal window opens, provide connection information for your session.

For more information about using the command line client, please refer to the PostgreSQL Core Documentation at:

[https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/app-psql.html](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.6/static/app-psql.html)

## **Connecting to Advanced Server with the pgAdmin 4 Client**

pgAdmin 4 provides an interactive graphical interface that you can use to manage your database and database objects. Easy-to-use dialogs and online help simplify tasks such as object creation, role management, and granting or revoking privileges. The tabbed browser panel provides quick access to information about the object currently selected in the pgAdmin tree control.

To open pgAdmin, use the Linux Applications or Windows Start menu to access the EDB Postgres menu; navigate through the Advanced Server 10 menu to select pgAdmin. The client opens as shown in Figure 6.5.

!\[image](./images/image58.png)

*Figure 6.5 – The pgAdmin 4 client.*

To connect to the Advanced Server database server, expand the server node of the Browser tree control, and right click on the EDB Postgres Advanced Server node. When the context menu opens, select Connect Server. The Connect to Server dialog opens (see Figure 6.6).

*Figure 6.6 – The pgAdmin 4 client.*

Provide the password associated with the database superuser in the Password field, and click OK to connect.

!\[image](./images/image60.png)

*Figure 6.7 – The pgAdmin client.*

When the client connects (see Figure 6.7), you can use the Browser tree control to retrieve information about existing database objects, or to create new objects. For more information about using the pgAdmin client, use the Help drop-down menu to access the online help files.
