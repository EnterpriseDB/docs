<div id="using_command_tags_to_filter_audit_logs" class="registered_link"></div>

Each entry in the log file contains a *command tag*, except for entries that display an error message. A command tag is the SQL command executed for that log entry. The command tag makes it possible to use tools later to scan the log file to find entries related to a SQL command.

This example is in XML form, formatted for easier review. The command tag is displayed as the `command_tag` attribute of the `event` element with values `CREATE ROLE`, `ALTER ROLE`, and `DROP ROLE`.

```xml
<event user="enterprisedb" database="edb" process_id="64234" remote_host=
"[local]"
       session_id="5ecbc7e6.faea" session_line_num="2" process_status="idle"
       session_start_time="2020-05-25 18:58:06 IST" log_time="2020-05-25
       18:58:21.147 IST"
       virtual_transaction_id="4/30" type="create" command_tag="CREATE ROLE"
       application_name="psql" backend_type="client backend">
           <error_severity>AUDIT</error_severity>
           <message>statement: CREATE ROLE newuser WITH LOGIN;</message>
</event>
<event user="enterprisedb" database="edb" process_id="64234" remote_host=

       session_id="5ecbc7e6.faea" session_line_num="3" process_status="idle"
       session_start_time="2020-05-25 18:58:06 IST" log_time="2020-05-25
       18:58:34.142 IST"
       virtual_transaction_id="4/31" type="error" sql_state_code="42601"
       application_name="psql" backend_type="client backend">
           <error_severity>ERROR</error_severity>
           <message>unrecognized role option &quot;super&quot;</message>
           <query>ALTER ROLE newuser WITH SUPER USER;</query>
           <query_pos>25</query_pos>
</event>
<event user="enterprisedb" database="edb" process_id="64234" remote_host=
"[local]"
       session_id="5ecbc7e6.faea" session_line_num="4" process_status="idle"
       session_start_time="2020-05-25 18:58:06 IST" log_time="2020-05-25
       18:58:44.680 IST"
       virtual_transaction_id="4/32" type="alter" command_tag="ALTER ROLE"
       application_name="psql" backend_type="client backend">
           <error_severity>AUDIT</error_severity>
           <message>statement: ALTER ROLE newuser WITH SUPERUSER;</message>
</event>
<event user="enterprisedb" database="edb" process_id="64234" remote_host=
"[local]"
       session_id="5ecbc7e6.faea" session_line_num="5" process_status="idle"
       session_start_time="2020-05-25 18:58:06 IST" log_time="2020-05-25
       18:58:58.173 IST"
       virtual_transaction_id="4/33" type="drop" command_tag="DROP ROLE"
       application_name="psql" backend_type="client backend">
           <error_severity>AUDIT</error_severity>
           <message>statement: DROP ROLE newuser;</message>
</event>
```

The following is the same example in CSV form. The command tag is the next-to-last column of each entry. In the listing, the column that appears empty (""), is the value of the `edb_audit_tag` parameter, if provided.

(Each audit log entry was split and displays across multiple lines. A blank line was inserted between the audit log entries for visual clarity.)
