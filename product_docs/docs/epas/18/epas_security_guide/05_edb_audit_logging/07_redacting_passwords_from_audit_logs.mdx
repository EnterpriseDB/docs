You can use the GUC parameter `edb_filter_log.redact_password_commands` under the `postgresql.conf` file to redact stored passwords in the log file. 

The syntax is:

```sql
{CREATE|ALTER} {USER|ROLE|GROUP} identifier 
   { [WITH] [ENCRYPTED] PASSWORD 'nonempty_string_literal' 
    | IDENTIFIED BY { 'nonempty_string_literal' 
    | bareword } } 
    [ REPLACE { 'nonempty_string_literal' | bareword } ]
```

To enable password redaction, you must first enable the parameter by modifying the `postgresql.conf` file. Add the following value to those specified in the `shared_preload_libraries` parameter:

```text
$libdir/edb_filter_log
```

Then, set `edb_filter_log.redact_password_commands` to `true`:

```ini
edb_filter_log.redact_password_commands = true
```

After modifying the `postgresql.conf` file, you must restart the server for the changes to take effect.

## Examples

When the following statement is logged by `log_statement`, the server redacts the password to `x`. For example, this command is added to the log file:

```sql
CREATE USER carol with login PASSWORD '1safepwd';
```

It appears as:

```text
2021-05-17 05:01:46.841 IST,"enterprisedb","edb",18415,"[local]",60a230f0.47ef,1,"idle",2021-05-17 05:01:36 IST,3/3,0,AUDIT,00000,"statement: CREATE USER carol with login PASSWORD 'x';",,,,,,,,,"psql","client backend","CREATE ROLE","","create"
```

When the following statement is logged by `log_statement`, the server identifies the new password, replace, and redact the password to `x`. For example, this command is added to the log file:
 
```sql
ALTER USER carol IDENTIFIED BY 'new_pass' REPLACE '1safepwd'; 
```

It appears as:

```text
2021-05-19 04:41:45.718 IST,"enterprisedb","edb",19354,"[local]",60a23a72.4b9a,1,"idle",2021-05-19 04:41:23 IST,3/3,0,AUDIT,00000,"statement: ALTER USER carol IDENTIFIED BY 'x' REPLACE 'x';",,,,,,,,,"psql","client backend","ALTER ROLE","","alter"
```

The statement that includes a password is logged. The server redacts the password text to `x`. When the statement is logged as context for some other message, the server omits the statement from the context.
