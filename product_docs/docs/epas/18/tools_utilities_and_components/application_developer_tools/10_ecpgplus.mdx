EDB has enhanced ECPG (the PostgreSQL precompiler) to create ECPGPlus. ECPGPlus allows you to include embedded SQL commands in C applications. When you use ECPGPlus to compile an application that contains embedded SQL commands, the SQL code is syntax checked and translated into C.

ECPGPlus supports Pro\*C-compatible syntax in C programs when connected to an EDB Postgres Advanced Server database. ECPGPlus supports:

-   Oracle Dynamic SQL – Method 4 (ODS-M4)
-   Pro\*C-compatible anonymous blocks
-   A `CALL` statement compatible with Oracle databases

As part of ECPGPlus' Pro\*C compatibility, you don't need to include the `BEGIN DECLARE SECTION` and `END DECLARE SECTION` directives.

See [ECPGPlus overview](../../application_programming/ecpgplus_guide/02_overview/) for details about installing and configuring the utility.
