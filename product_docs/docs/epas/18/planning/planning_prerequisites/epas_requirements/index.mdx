EDB Postgres Advanced Server has certain hardware and software requirements. PostgreSQL has some hard limits that are important to know about during your planning.

## Hardware requirements

The following installation requirements assume that you selected the default options during the installation process. The minimum hardware requirements to install and run EDB Postgres Advanced Server are:

-   1 GHz processor
-   2 GB of RAM
-   512 MB of HDD

Additional disk space is required for data or supporting components.

## Software requirements

### User privileges

To perform an EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation on a Linux system you need superuser, administrator, or sudo privileges.

To perform an EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation on a Windows system, you need administrator privileges. If you're installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server on a Windows system that's configured with **User Account Control** enabled, you can assume the privileges required to invoke the graphical installer. Right-click the name of the installer, and select **Run as administrator** from the context menu.

### Windows-specific software requirements

Apply the Windows operating system updates before invoking the installer. If the installer encounters errors during the installation process, exit the installation, and ensure that your Windows version is up to date. Then restart the installer.

See the [release notes](../../../epas_rel_notes) for the features added in EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17.


## Hard limits

The following table describes various hard limits of PostgreSQL. However, practical limits such as performance limitations or available disk space might apply before absolute hard limits are reached.

!!! Note
    -   The maximum number of columns for a table is further reduced as the tuple being stored must fit in a single 8192-byte heap page. For example, excluding the tuple header, a tuple made up of 1600 `int` columns consumes 6400 bytes and can be stored in a heap page. But a tuple of 1600 `bigint` columns consumes 12800 bytes and therefore doesn't fit inside a heap page. Variable-length fields of types such as `text`, `varchar`, and `char` can have their values stored out of line in the table's `TOAST` table when the values are large enough to require it. Only an 18-byte pointer must remain inside the tuple in the table's heap. For shorter length variable-length fields, either a 4-byte or 1-byte field header is used, and the value is stored inside the heap tuple.

    -   Columns that were dropped from the table also contribute to the maximum column limit. Moreover, although the dropped column values for newly created tuples are internally marked as null in the tuple's null bitmap, the null bitmap also occupies space.
