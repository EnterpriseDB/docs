You can use the pg_ctl utility to control an EDB Postgres Advanced Server service from the command line on any platform. pg_ctl allows you to start, stop, or restart the EDB Postgres Advanced Server database server, reload the configuration parameters, or display the status of a running server. To invoke the utility, assume the identity of the cluster owner, navigate into the home directory of EDB Postgres Advanced Server, and issue the command:

```text
./bin/pg_ctl -D <data_directory> <action>
```

Where:

`data_directory` is the location of the data controlled by the EDB Postgres Advanced Server cluster.

`action` specifies the action taken by the pg_ctl utility. Specify:

-   `start` to start the service.
-   `stop` to stop the service.
-   `restart` to stop and then start the service.
-   `reload` to send the server a `SIGHUP` signal, reloading configuration parameters.
-   `status` to discover the current status of the service.

For more information about using the pg_ctl utility or the command-line options available, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-pg-ctl.html).
