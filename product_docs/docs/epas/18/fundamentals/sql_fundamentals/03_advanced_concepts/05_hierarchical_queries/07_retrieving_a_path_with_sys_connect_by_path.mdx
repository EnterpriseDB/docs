`SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH` is a function that works in a hierarchical query to retrieve the column values of a specified column that occur between the current node and the root node. 

## Syntax 

The signature of the function is:

```sql
SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH (<column>, <delimiter>)
```

The function takes two arguments:

-  `column` is the name of a column that resides in a table specified in the hierarchical query that's calling the function.
-  `delimiter` is the `varchar` value that separates each entry in the specified column.

## Examples 

This example returns a list of employee names and their managers. If the manager has a manager, that name is appended to the result.

```sql
edb=# SELECT level, ename , SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH(ename, '/') managers
      FROM emp
      CONNECT BY PRIOR empno = mgr
      START WITH mgr IS NULL
      ORDER BY level, ename, managers;
__OUTPUT__
 level | ename  |        managers
-------+--------+-------------------------
     1 | KING   | /KING
     2 | BLAKE  | /KING/BLAKE
     2 | CLARK  | /KING/CLARK
     2 | JONES  | /KING/JONES
     3 | ALLEN  | /KING/BLAKE/ALLEN
     3 | FORD   | /KING/JONES/FORD
     3 | JAMES  | /KING/BLAKE/JAMES
     3 | MARTIN | /KING/BLAKE/MARTIN
     3 | MILLER | /KING/CLARK/MILLER
     3 | SCOTT  | /KING/JONES/SCOTT
     3 | TURNER | /KING/BLAKE/TURNER
     3 | WARD   | /KING/BLAKE/WARD
     4 | ADAMS  | /KING/JONES/SCOTT/ADAMS
     4 | SMITH  | /KING/JONES/FORD/SMITH
(14 rows)
```

In the result set:

-   The `level` column displays the number of levels that the query returned.
-   The `ename` column displays the employee name.
-   The `managers` column contains the hierarchical list of managers.

The EDB Postgres Advanced Server implementation of `SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH` doesn't support use of:

-   `SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH` inside `CONNECT_BY_PATH`
-   `SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH` inside `SYS_CONNECT_BY_PATH`
