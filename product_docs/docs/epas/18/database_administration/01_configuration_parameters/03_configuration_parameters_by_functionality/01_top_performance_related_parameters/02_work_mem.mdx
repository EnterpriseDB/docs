Specifies the amount of memory for internal sort operations and hash tables to use before writing to temporary disk files. 

For a complex query, several sort or hash operations might run in parallel. Each operation is allowed to use as much memory as this value specifies before it starts to write data into temporary files. Also, several running sessions might perform such operations concurrently. Therefore, the total memory used might be many times the value of `work_mem`. Keep this information in mind when choosing the value. 

Sort operations are used for `ORDER BY`, `DISTINCT`, and merge joins. Hash tables are used in hash joins, hash-based aggregation, and hash-based processing of `IN` subqueries.

Reasonable values are typically between 4MB and 64MB, depending on the size of your machine, how many concurrent connections you expect (determined by `max_connections`), and the complexity of your queries.
