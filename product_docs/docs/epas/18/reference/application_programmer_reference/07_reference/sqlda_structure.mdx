title: "The SQLDA structure"
---

Oracle Dynamic SQL method 4 uses the SQLDA data structure to hold the data and metadata for a dynamic SQL statement. A SQLDA structure can describe a set of input parameters corresponding to the parameter markers found in the text of a dynamic statement or the result set of a dynamic statement. 

## Layout

The layout of the SQLDA structure is:

```c
struct SQLDA
{
  int     N; /* Number of entries             */
  char  **V; /* Variables                 */
  int    *L; /* Variable lengths          */
  short  *T; /* Variable types            */
  short **I; /* Indicators                */
  int     F; /* Count of variables discovered by DESCRIBE */
  char  **S; /* Variable names            */
  short  *M; /* Variable name maximum lengths     */
  short  *C; /* Variable name actual lengths  */
  char  **X; /* Indicator names           */
  short  *Y; /* Indicator name maximum lengths */
  short  *Z; /* Indicator name actual lengths     */
};
```

## Parameters

`N - maximum number of entries`

 The `N` structure member contains the maximum number of entries that the SQLDA can describe. This member is populated by the `sqlald()` function when you allocate the SQLDA structure. Before using a descriptor in an `OPEN` or `FETCH` statement, you must set `N` to the actual number of values described.

`V - data values`

 The `V` structure member is a pointer to an array of data values.

-   For a `SELECT`-list descriptor, `V` points to an array of values returned by a `FETCH` statement. Each member in the array corresponds to a column in the result set.
-   For a bind descriptor, `V` points to an array of parameter values. You must populate the values in this array before opening a cursor that uses the descriptor.

Your application must allocate the space required to hold each value. See [displayResultSet](/epas/latest/application_programming/ecpgplus_guide/05_building_executing_dynamic_sql_statements/#executing_query_with_unknown_number_of_variables) for an example of how to allocate space for `SELECT`-list values.

`L - length of each data value`

 The `L` structure member is a pointer to an array of lengths. Each member of this array must indicate the amount of memory available in the corresponding member of the `V` array. For example, if `V[5]` points to a buffer large enough to hold a 20-byte NULL-terminated string, `L[5]` must contain the value 21 (20 bytes for the characters in the string plus 1 byte for the NULL-terminator). Your application must set each member of the `L` array.

`T - data types`

 The `T` structure member points to an array of data types, one for each column (or parameter) described by the descriptor.

-   For a bind descriptor, you must set each member of the `T` array to tell ECPGPlus the data type of each parameter.
-   For a `SELECT`-list descriptor, the `DESCRIBE SELECT LIST` statement sets each member of the `T` array to reflect the type of data found in the corresponding column.

You can change any member of the `T` array before executing a `FETCH` statement to force ECPGPlus to convert the corresponding value to a specific data type. For example, if the `DESCRIBE SELECT LIST` statement indicates that a given column is of type `DATE`, you can change the corresponding `T` member to request that the next `FETCH` statement return that value in the form of a NULL-terminated string. Each member of the `T` array is a numeric type code (see [Type Codes](type_codes.mdx) for a list of type codes). The type codes returned by a `DESCRIBE SELECT LIST` statement differ from those expected by a `FETCH` statement. After executing a `DESCRIBE SELECT LIST` statement, each member of `T` encodes a data type and a flag indicating whether the corresponding column is nullable. You can use the `sqlnul()` function to extract the type code and nullable flag from a member of the T array. The signature of the `sqlnul()` function is as follows:

```c
void sqlnul(unsigned short *valType,
            unsigned short *typeCode,
            int            *isNull)
```

For example, to find the type code and nullable flag for the third column of a descriptor named results, invoke `sqlnul()` as follows:

```c
sqlnul(&results->T[2], &typeCode, &isNull);
```

`I - indicator variables`

 The `I` structure member points to an array of indicator variables. This array is allocated for you when your application calls the `sqlald()` function to allocate the descriptor.

-   For a `SELECT`-list descriptor, each member of the `I` array indicates whether the corresponding column contains a NULL (non-zero) or non-NULL (zero) value.
-   For a bind parameter, your application must set each member of the `I` array to indicate whether the corresponding parameter value is NULL.

`F - number of entries`

 The `F` structure member indicates how many values are described by the descriptor. The `N` structure member indicates the maximum number of values that the descriptor can describe. `F` indicates the actual number of values. The value of the `F` member is set by ECPGPlus when you execute a `DESCRIBE` statement. `F` can be positive, negative, or zero.

-   For a `SELECT`-list descriptor, `F` contains a positive value if the number of columns in the result set is equal to or less than the maximum number of values permitted by the descriptor (as determined by the `N` structure member). It contains 0 if the statement isn't a `SELECT` statement. It contains a negative value if the query returns more columns than allowed by the `N` structure member.
-   For a bind descriptor, `F` contains a positive number if the number of parameters found in the statement is less than or equal to the maximum number of values permitted by the descriptor (as determined by the `N` structure member). It contains 0 if the statement contains no parameters markers. It contains a negative value if the statement contains more parameter markers than allowed by the `N` structure member.

If `F` contains a positive number (after executing a `DESCRIBE` statement), that number reflects the count of columns in the result set (for a `SELECT`-list descriptor) or the number of parameter markers found in the statement (for a bind descriptor). If `F` contains a negative value, you can compute the absolute value of `F` to discover how many values or parameter markers are required. For example, if `F` contains `-24` after describing a `SELECT` list, you know that the query returns 24 columns.

`S - column/parameter names`

 The `S` structure member points to an array of NULL-terminated strings.

-   For a `SELECT`-list descriptor, the `DESCRIBE SELECT LIST` statement sets each member of this array to the name of the corresponding column in the result set.
-   For a bind descriptor, the `DESCRIBE BIND VARIABLES` statement sets each member of this array to the name of the corresponding bind variable.

In this release, the name of each bind variable is determined by the left-to-right order of the parameter marker within the query. For example, the name of the first parameter is always `?0`, the name of the second parameter is always `?1`, and so on.

`M - maximum column/parameter name length`

 The `M` structure member points to an array of lengths. Each member in this array specifies the maximum length of the corresponding member of the `S` array (that is, `M[0]` specifies the maximum length of the column/parameter name found at `S[0]`). This array is populated by the `sqlald()` function.

`C - actual column/parameter name length`

 The `C` structure member points to an array of lengths. Each member in this array specifies the actual length of the corresponding member of the `S` array (that is, `C[0]` specifies the actual length of the column/parameter name found at `S[0]`).

 This array is populated by the `DESCRIBE` statement.

`X - indicator variable names`

 The `X` structure member points to an array of NULL-terminated strings. Each string represents the name of a NULL indicator for the corresponding value.

 This array isn't used by ECPGPlus but is provided for compatibility with Pro\*C applications.

`Y - maximum indicator name length`

 The `Y` structure member points to an array of lengths. Each member in this array specifies the maximum length of the corresponding member of the `X` array (that is, `Y[0]` specifies the maximum length of the indicator name found at `X[0]`).

 This array isn't used by ECPGPlus but is provided for compatibility with Pro\*C applications.

`Z - actual indicator name length`

 The `Z` structure member points to an array of lengths. Each member in this array specifies the actual length of the corresponding member of the `X` array (that is, `Z[0]` specifies the actual length of the indicator name found at `X[0]`).

 This array isn't used by ECPGPlus but is provided for compatibility with Pro\*C applications.
