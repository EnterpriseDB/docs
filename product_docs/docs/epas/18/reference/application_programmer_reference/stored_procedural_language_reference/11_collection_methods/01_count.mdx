<div id="count" class="registered_link"></div>

`COUNT` is a method that returns the number of elements in a collection. 

## Syntax 

The syntax for using `COUNT` is:

```sql
<collection>.COUNT
```

Where `collection` is the name of a collection.

For a varray, `COUNT` always equals `LAST`.

## Example

This example shows that an associative array can be sparsely populated, with gaps in the sequence of assigned elements. `COUNT` includes only the elements that were assigned a value.

```sql
DECLARE
    TYPE sparse_arr_typ IS TABLE OF NUMBER INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;
    sparse_arr      sparse_arr_typ;
BEGIN
    sparse_arr(-100)  := -100;
    sparse_arr(-10)   := -10;
    sparse_arr(0)     := 0;
    sparse_arr(10)    := 10;
    sparse_arr(100)   := 100;
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('COUNT: ' || sparse_arr.COUNT);
END;
```

The following output shows that there are five populated elements included in `COUNT`:

```sql
__OUTPUT__
COUNT: 5
```
