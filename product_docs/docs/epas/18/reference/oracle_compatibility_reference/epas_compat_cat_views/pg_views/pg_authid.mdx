The `PG_AUTHID` view provides information about database authorization identifiers (that is, roles). A role includes users and groups.

In addition to the information in the [PostgreSQL pg_authid description](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/catalog-pg-authid.html), EDB Postgres Advanced Server provides the following information.

## Viewing privileges

There are functions designed to check redwood specific privileges for a role. They are useful for verifying permissions within SQL commands or for troubleshooting access issues. For more information see, [functions to view redwood specific privileges](../../../sql_reference/03_functions_and_operators/redwood_specific_privs_functions.mdx).
