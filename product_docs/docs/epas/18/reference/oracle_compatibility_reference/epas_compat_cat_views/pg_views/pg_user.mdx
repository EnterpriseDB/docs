## View privileges

There are functions designed to check a user's privileges. They are useful for verifying permissions within system scripts or for troubleshooting access issues. For more information see, [functions to view redwood specific privileges](../../../sql_reference/03_functions_and_operators/redwood_specific_privs_functions.mdx).
