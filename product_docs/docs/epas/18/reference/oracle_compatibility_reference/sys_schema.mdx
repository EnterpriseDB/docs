description: Information about the SYS schema in EDB Postgres Advanced Server
---

The database utilizes an Oracle-compatible SYS schema containing standard system objects (functions, procedures, packages, views, etc.).

During a schema dump operation:

- System object definitions are excluded from the SYS schema.

- Permission changes for SYS objects are included.

- User-defined objects created within the SYS schema are included.
