EDB Postgres Advanced Server's implementation of `UTL_SMTP` is a partial implementation when compared to Oracle's version. Only the functions and procedures listed in the table are supported.

The following table lists the public variables available in the `UTL_SMTP` package.

| Public variables | Data type | Value | Description                        |
| ---------------- | --------- | ----- | ---------------------------------- |
| `connection`     | `RECORD`  |       | Description of an SMTP connection. |
| `reply`          | `RECORD`  |       | SMTP reply line.                   |

## CONNECTION

The `CONNECTION` record type provides a description of an SMTP connection.

```sql
TYPE connection IS RECORD(
   host            VARCHAR2(255),
   port            PLS_INTEGER,
   tx_timeout      PLS_INTEGER
);
```

<div id="reply_replies" class="registered_link"></div>

## REPLY/REPLIES

The `REPLY` record type provides a description of an SMTP reply line. `REPLIES` is a table of multiple SMTP reply lines.

```sql
TYPE reply IS RECORD(
   code  INTEGER,
   text  VARCHAR2(508)
); 

TYPE replies IS TABLE OF reply INDEX BY BINARY_INTEGER;
```

---

## AUTH

These subprograms send the AUTH command to authenticate with the SMTP server. The UTL_SMTP package automatically attempts the user's chosen authentication schemes in order, selecting the first one supported by the server.

```sql
# Procedure
AUTH(
   c         IN OUT  connection,
   username  VARCHAR2,
   password  VARCHAR2,
   schemes   VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NON_CLEARTEXT_PASSWORD_SCHEMES
);

# Function
AUTH(
   c          IN OUT connection,
   username   VARCHAR2,
   password   VARCHAR2,
   schemes    VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NON_CLEARTEXT_PASSWORD_SCHEMES
) RETURN reply;
```

### Parameters

`c`

 The SMTP connection to authenticate.

`username`

 The username for authentication.

`password`

 The password for authentication.

`schemes`

 The authentication schemes to attempt. The default is `NON_CLEARTEXT_PASSWORD_SCHEMES`. Allowed values are `ALL_SCHEMES` and `NON_CLEARTEXT_PASSWORD_SCHEMES`.

`reply`

 SMTP reply to the command. If SMTP returns multiple replies, only the last one is returned in `reply`.

 See [Reply/Replies](#replyreplies) for a description of `REPLY` and `REPLIES`.

!!! Note
    - `NON_CLEARTEXT_PASSWORD_SCHEMES` supports the CRAM-MD5 authentication schemes which do not transmit passwords in clear text over SMTP.
    These schemes are available for use even when the connection is not secured by SSL/TLS.
    Although these schemes avoid cleartext transmission, their overall security may still be compromised when used over an unsecured SMTP connection.

    - `ALL_SCHEMES` supports `PLAIN`, `LOGIN` and `CRAM-MD5` authentication schemes. The `PLAIN` and `LOGIN` schemes transmit passwords in clear text over SMTP and should only be used over a secure SSL/TLS connection.

---

## CLOSE_DATA

The `CLOSE_DATA` procedure terminates an email message by sending the following sequence:

`<CR><LF>.<CR><LF>`

This is a single period at the beginning of a line.

```sql
# Procedure

   c IN OUT CONNECTION
);

# Function
CLOSE_DATA(
    c IN OUT CONNECTION
) RETURN reply;
```

### Parameters

`c`

 SMTP reply to the command. If SMTP returns multiple replies, only the last one is returned in `reply`.

 See [Reply/Replies](#replyreplies) for a description of `REPLY` and `REPLIES`.

---

## COMMAND

The `COMMAND` subprograms executes an SMTP command. If you're expecting multiple reply lines, use `COMMAND_REPLIES`.

```sql
# Procedure
COMMAND( 
   c   IN OUT CONNECTION, 
   cmd VARCHAR2,
   arg VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL
); 

# Function
COMMAND( 
   c   IN OUT CONNECTION, 
   cmd VARCHAR2, 
   arg VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL
) RETURN reply;
```

### Parameters

 See [Reply/Replies](#replyreplies) for a description of `REPLY` and `REPLIES`.

---

## COMMAND_REPLIES

The `COMMAND_REPLIES` function processes an SMTP command that returns multiple reply lines. Use `COMMAND` if you expect only a single reply line.

```sql
COMMAND_REPLIES(
   c   IN OUT CONNECTION, 
   cmd VARCHAR2,
   arg VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL
) RETURN replies;
```

### Parameters

`c`

 The SMTP connection to which to send the command.

`cmd`

## EHLO

The `EHLO` subprograms performs initial handshaking with the SMTP server after establishing the connection. The `EHLO` procedure allows the client to identify itself to the SMTP server according to RFC 821. RFC 1869 specifies the format of the information returned in the server’s reply. The `HELO` procedure performs the equivalent functionality but returns less information about the server.

```sql
# Procedure
EHLO(
   c      IN OUT CONNECTION, 
   domain VARCHAR2
);

# Function
EHLO(
   c      IN OUT CONNECTION, 
   domain VARCHAR2
) RETURN replies;
```

### Parameters

`c`

 The connection to the SMTP server over which to perform handshaking.

`domain`

 Domain name of the sending host.

`replies`

 SMTP reply lines to the command. See [Reply/Replies](#replyreplies) for a description of `REPLY` and `REPLIES`.

---

## HELO

The `HELO` subprograms performs initial handshaking with the SMTP server after establishing the connection. The `HELO` procedure allows the client to identify itself to the SMTP server according to RFC 821. The `EHLO` procedure performs the equivalent functionality but returns more information about the server.

```sql
# Procedure
HELO(
   c      IN OUT CONNECTION, 
   domain VARCHAR2
);

# Function
HELO(
   c      IN OUT CONNECTION,

`reply`

 SMTP reply to the command. If SMTP returns multiple replies, only the last one is returned in `reply`.

 See [Reply/Replies](#replyreplies) for a description of `REPLY` and `REPLIES`.

---

## RSET

The `RSET` subprograms terminate the current mail transaction.

```sql
# Procedure
RSET(
   c IN OUT CONNECTION
);

# Function
RSET(
   c IN OUT CONNECTION
) RETURN reply;
```

### Parameters

`c`

 SMTP connection on which to cancel the mail transaction.

`reply`

 SMTP reply to the command. If SMTP returns multiple replies, only the last one is returned in `reply`.

 See [Reply/Replies](#replyreplies) for a description of `REPLY` and `REPLIES`.

---

## STARTTLS

These subprograms ensure a secure SMTP connection by sending the STARTTLS command to establish SSL/TLS encryption.

```sql
# Procedure
STARTTLS(
    c           IN OUT connection,
    secure_host VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL
);

# Function
STARTTLS(
   c            IN OUT connection,
   secure_host  VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL
) RETURN reply;
```

### Parameters

`c`

SMTP connection on which to send the command.

`secure_host`

The host name to be matched against the common name of the SMTP server’s SSL certificate. It can also be a domain name like "*.example.com". If NULL, the SMTP host name is used to connect.

`reply`

 SMTP reply to the command. If SMTP returns multiple replies, only the last one is returned in `reply`.

 See [Reply/Replies](#replyreplies) for a description of `REPLY` and `REPLIES`.

---

## VRFY

The `VRFY` function validates and verifies the recipient’s email address. If valid, the recipient’s full name and fully qualified mailbox are returned.

```sql
VRFY(
   c         IN OUT CONNECTION, 
   recipient VARCHAR2
) RETURN reply;
```

### Parameters

`c`

 The SMTP connection on which to verify the email address.

`recipient`

 The recipient’s email address to verify.

`reply`

 SMTP reply to the command. If SMTP returns multiple replies, only the last one is returned in `reply`. 

 See [Reply/Replies](#replyreplies) for a description of `REPLY` and `REPLIES`.

---

## WRITE_DATA

The `WRITE_DATA` procedure adds `VARCHAR2` data to an email message. You can call the `WRITE_DATA` procedure repeatedly to add data.

```sql
WRITE_DATA(
    c    IN OUT CONNECTION, 
    data VARCHAR2
);
```

### Parameters

`c`

 The SMTP connection on which to add data.

`data`

 Data to add to the email message. The data must conform to the RFC 822 specification.

---

## Comprehensive example

This procedure constructs and sends a text email message using the `UTL_SMTP` package.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE send_mail (
    p_sender        VARCHAR2,
    p_recipient     VARCHAR2,
    p_subj          VARCHAR2,
    p_msg           VARCHAR2,
    p_mailhost      VARCHAR2
)
IS
    v_conn          UTL_SMTP.CONNECTION;
    v_crlf          CONSTANT VARCHAR2(2) := CHR(13) || CHR(10);
    v_port          CONSTANT PLS_INTEGER := 25;
BEGIN
    v_conn := UTL_SMTP.OPEN_CONNECTION(p_mailhost,v_port);
    UTL_SMTP.HELO(v_conn,p_mailhost);
    UTL_SMTP.MAIL(v_conn,p_sender);
    UTL_SMTP.RCPT(v_conn,p_recipient);
    UTL_SMTP.DATA(v_conn, SUBSTR(
        'Date: ' || TO_CHAR(SYSDATE,
        'Dy, DD Mon YYYY HH24:MI:SS') || v_crlf
        || 'From: ' || p_sender || v_crlf
        || 'To: ' || p_recipient || v_crlf
        || 'Subject: ' || p_subj || v_crlf
        || p_msg
        , 1, 32767));
    UTL_SMTP.QUIT(v_conn);
END;

EXEC send_mail('asmith@enterprisedb.com','pjones@enterprisedb.com','Holiday
Party','Are you planning to attend?','smtp.enterprisedb.com');
```

This example uses the `OPEN_DATA`, `WRITE_DATA`, and `CLOSE_DATA` procedures instead of the `DATA` procedure. Also, it uses `AUTH` to authenticate to the server and `STARTTLS` to make the connection secure.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE send_mail_2 (
    p_sender        VARCHAR2,
    p_recipient     VARCHAR2,
    p_subj          VARCHAR2,
    p_msg           VARCHAR2,
    p_mailhost      VARCHAR2,
    p_ssl_cert_path	VARCHAR2,
    p_username		VARCHAR2,
    p_password		VARCHAR2
)
IS
    v_conn          UTL_SMTP.CONNECTION;
    v_crlf          CONSTANT VARCHAR2(2) := CHR(13) || CHR(10);
    v_port          CONSTANT PLS_INTEGER := 25;
BEGIN
    v_conn := UTL_SMTP.OPEN_CONNECTION(p_mailhost,v_port,ssl_cert_path => p_ssl_cert_path);
    UTL_SMTP.STARTTLS(v_conn);
    UTL_SMTP.HELO(v_conn,p_mailhost);
    UTL_SMTP.AUTH(v_conn,p_username,p_password,UTL_SMTP.NON_CLEARTEXT_PASSWORD_SCHEMES);
    UTL_SMTP.MAIL(v_conn,p_sender);
    UTL_SMTP.RCPT(v_conn,p_recipient);
    UTL_SMTP.OPEN_DATA(v_conn);
    UTL_SMTP.WRITE_DATA(v_conn,'From: ' || p_sender || v_crlf);
    UTL_SMTP.WRITE_DATA(v_conn,'To: ' || p_recipient || v_crlf);
    UTL_SMTP.WRITE_DATA(v_conn,'Subject: ' || p_subj || v_crlf);
    UTL_SMTP.WRITE_DATA(v_conn,v_crlf || p_msg);
    UTL_SMTP.CLOSE_DATA(v_conn);
    UTL_SMTP.QUIT(v_conn);
END;

EXEC send_mail_2('asmith@enterprisedb.com','pjones@enterprisedb.com','Holiday
Party','Are you planning to attend?','smtp.enterprisedb.com','/etc/ssl/certs/sendmail.pem','edb','edb');
```
