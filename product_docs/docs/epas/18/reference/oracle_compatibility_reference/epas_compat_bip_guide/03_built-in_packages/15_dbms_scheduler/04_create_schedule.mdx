Use the `CREATE_SCHEDULE` procedure to create a job schedule. The signature of the `CREATE_SCHEDULE` procedure is:

```sql
CREATE_SCHEDULE(
  <schedule_name> IN VARCHAR2,
  <start_date> IN TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NULL,
  <repeat_interval> IN VARCHAR2,
  <end_date> IN TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NULL,
  <comments> IN VARCHAR2 DEFAULT NULL)
```

## Parameters

`schedule_name`

 `schedule_name` specifies the name of the schedule.

`start_date`

 `start_date` is a `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` value that specifies the date and time that the schedule is eligible to execute. If you don't specify a `start_date`, the date that the job is enabled is used as the `start_date`. By default, `start_date` is `NULL`.

`repeat_interval`

 `repeat_interval` is a `VARCHAR2` value that specifies how often the job repeats. If you don't specify a `repeat_interval`, the job executes only once, on the date specified by `start_date`.

 !!! Note 
    You must provide a value for either `start_date` or `repeat_interval`. If both `start_date` and `repeat_interval` are `NULL`, the server returns an error.

`end_date`

 `end_date` is a `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE` value that specifies a time after which the schedule no longer executes. If you specify a date, the `end_date` must be after the `start_date`. The default value is `NULL`.

 !!! Note
     If you specify a `repeat_interval` and don't specify an `end_date`, the schedule repeats indefinitely until you disable it.

`comments`

 Use the `comments` parameter to specify a comment about the schedule. By default, this parameter is `NULL`.

## Example

This code fragment calls `CREATE_SCHEDULE` to create a schedule named `weeknights_at_5`:

```sql
EXEC
  DBMS_SCHEDULER.CREATE_SCHEDULE (
    schedule_name    => 'weeknights_at_5',
    start_date       => '01-JUN-13 09:00:00.000000',
    repeat_interval  => 'FREQ=DAILY;BYDAY=MON,TUE,WED,THU,FRI;BYHOUR=17;',
    comments         => 'This schedule executes each weeknight at 5:00');
```

The schedule executes each weeknight, at 5:00, effective after June 1, 2013. Since no `end_date` is specified, the schedule executes indefinitely until disabled with `DBMS_SCHEDULER.DISABLE`.
