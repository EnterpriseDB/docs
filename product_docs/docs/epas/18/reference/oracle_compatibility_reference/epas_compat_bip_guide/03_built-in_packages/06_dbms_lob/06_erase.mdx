The `ERASE` procedure erases a portion of a large object. To erase a large object means to replace the specified portion with zero-byte fillers for `BLOB` or with spaces for `CLOB`. The actual size of the large object isn't altered.

```sql
ERASE(<lob_loc> IN OUT { BLOB | CLOB }, <amount> IN OUT NUMBER
  [, <offset> NUMBER ])
```

## Parameters

`lob_loc`

 Large object locator of the large object to erase.

`amount IN`

 Number of bytes/characters to erase.

`amount OUT`

 Number of bytes/characters erased. This value can be smaller than the input value if the end of the large object is reached before `amount` bytes/characters are erased.

`offset`

 Position in the large object where erasing begins. The first byte/character is position 1. The default is 1.
