## Name

`ALTER USER` &mdash; Change a database user account.

## Synopsis

```sql
ALTER USER <role_name> IDENTIFIED BY <password> REPLACE <prev_password>
```

## Description

A role without the `CREATEROLE` privilege can use this command to change their own password. An unprivileged role must include the `REPLACE` clause and their previous password if `PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION` isn't `NULL` in their profile. When a non-superuser uses the `REPLACE` clause, the server compares the password provided to the existing password and raises an error if the passwords don't match.

A database superuser can use this command to change the password associated with any role. If a superuser includes the `REPLACE` clause, the clause is ignored. A non-matching value for the previous password doesn't throw an error.

If the role for which the password is being changed has the `SUPERUSER` attribute, then a superuser must issue this command. A role with the `CREATEROLE` attribute can use this command to change the password associated with a role that isn't a superuser.

## Parameters

`role_name`

 The name of the role whose password to alter.

`password`

 The role’s new password.

`prev_password`

 The role’s previous password.

## Examples

Change a user password:

```sql
ALTER USER john IDENTIFIED BY xyRP35z REPLACE 23PJ74a;
```
