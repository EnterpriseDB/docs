## Name

`COMMIT` &mdash; Commit the current transaction.

## Synopsis

```sql
COMMIT [ WORK ]
```

## Description

`COMMIT` commits the current transaction. All changes made by the transaction become visible to others and are guaranteed to be durable if a crash occurs.

## Parameters

`WORK`

 Optional keyword that has no effect.

## Notes

Use `ROLLBACK` to abort a transaction. Issuing `COMMIT` when not inside a transaction does no harm.

!!! Note
    Executing a `COMMIT` in a plpgsql procedure throws an error if there's an Oracle-style SPL procedure on the runtime stack.

## Examples

To commit the current transaction and make all changes permanent:

```sql
COMMIT;
```
