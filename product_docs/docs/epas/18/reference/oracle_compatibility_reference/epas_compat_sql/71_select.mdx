SELECT [ optimizer_hint ] [ ALL | DISTINCT | UNIQUE ]
  * | expression [ AS output_name ] [, ...]
  FROM from_item [, ...]
  [ WHERE condition ]
  [ [ START WITH start_expression ]
      CONNECT BY { PRIOR parent_expr = child_expr |
        child_expr = PRIOR parent_expr }
    [ ORDER SIBLINGS BY expression [ ASC | DESC ] [, ...] ] ]

```

Where `from_item` can be one of:

```sql
table_name[@dblink ] [ alias ]
( select ) alias
from_item [ NATURAL ] join_type from_item
  [ ON join_condition | USING ( join_column [, ...] ) ]
```

## Description

`SELECT` retrieves rows from one or more tables. The general processing of `SELECT` is as follows:

1.  All elements in the `FROM` list are computed. (Each element in the `FROM` list is a real or virtual table.) If you specify more than one element in the `FROM` list, they are cross joined. See [`FROM` clause](#from-clause).
2.  If you specify the `WHERE` clause, all rows that don't satisfy the condition are eliminated from the output. See [`WHERE` clause](#where-clause).
3.  If you specify the `GROUP BY` clause, the output is divided into groups of rows that match one or more values. The `HAVING` clause eliminates groups that don't satisfy the given condition. See [`GROUP BY` clause](#group-by-clause) and [`HAVING` clause](#having-clause).
4.  Using the operators `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, and `MINUS`, you can combine the output of more than one `SELECT` statement to form a single result set. The `UNION` operator returns all rows that are in one or both of the result sets. The `INTERSECT` operator returns all rows that are strictly in both result sets. The `MINUS` operator returns the rows that are in the first result set but not in the second. In all three cases, duplicate rows are eliminated. In the case of the `UNION` operator, if you specify `ALL`, then duplicates aren't eliminated. See [`UNION` clause](#union-clause), [`INTERSECT` clause](#intersect-clause), and [`MINUS` clause](#minus-clause).
5.  The actual output rows are computed using the `SELECT` output expressions for each selected row. See [`SELECT` list](#select-list).
6.  The `CONNECT BY` clause is used to select data that has a hierarchical relationship. Such data has a parent-child relationship between rows. See [`CONNECT BY` clause](#connect-by-clause).
7.  If you specify the `ORDER BY` clause, the returned rows are sorted in the specified order. Otherwise, the rows are returned in the order the system finds fastest to produce. See [`ORDER BY` clause](#order-by-clause).
8.  `DISTINCT | UNIQUE` eliminates duplicate rows from the result. `ALL` (the default) returns all candidate rows, including duplicates. See [`DISTINCT | UNIQUE` clause](#distinct--unique-clause).
9.  The `FOR UPDATE` clause causes the `SELECT` statement to lock the selected rows against concurrent updates. See [`FOR UPDATE` clause](#for-update-clause).

You must have `SELECT` privilege on a table to read its values. The use of `FOR UPDATE` requires `UPDATE` privilege as well.

## Parameters

`optimizer_hint`

 Comment-embedded hints to the optimizer for selecting an execution plan. See [Optimizer hints](../../../application_programming/optimizing_code/05_optimizer_hints/) for information about optimizer hints.

## FROM clause

The `FROM` clause specifies one or more source tables for a `SELECT` statement. The syntax is:

```sql
FROM source [, ...]
```

Where `source` can be one of following elements:

`table_name[@dblink ]`

 The name (optionally schema-qualified) of an existing table or view. `dblink` is a database link name identifying a remote database. See the [`CREATE DATABASE LINK`](21_create_public_database_link#create_public_database_link) command for information on database links.

`alias`

 A substitute name for the `FROM` item containing the alias. Use an alias for brevity or to eliminate ambiguity for self-joins where the same table is scanned multiple times. Providing an alias completely hides the name of the table or function. For example, given `FROM foo AS f`, the remainder of the `SELECT` must refer to this `FROM` item as `f`, not `foo`.

`select`

 A sub-`SELECT` can appear in the `FROM` clause. This acts as though its output were created as a temporary table for the duration of this single `SELECT` command. Surround the sub-`SELECT` with parentheses, and provide an alias for it.

`join_type`

 One of the following:

 `[ INNER ] JOIN`

 `LEFT [ OUTER ] JOIN`

 `RIGHT [ OUTER ] JOIN`

 `FULL [ OUTER ] JOIN`

 `CROSS JOIN`

 For the `INNER` and `OUTER` join types, you must specify a join condition, namely one of `NATURAL`, `ON join_condition`, or `USING (join_column [, ...] )`. For `CROSS JOIN`, you can't use any of these clauses.

 A `JOIN` clause combines two `FROM` items. Use parentheses to determine the order of nesting. Without parentheses, `JOINs` nest left-to-right. In any case `JOIN` binds more tightly than the commas separating `FROM` items.

 `CROSS JOIN` and `INNER JOIN` produce a simple Cartesian product, the same result that you get from listing the two items at the top level of `FROM` but restricted by any join condition. `CROSS JOIN` is equivalent to `INNER JOIN ON (TRUE)`, that is, no rows are removed by qualification. These join types are a notational convenience, since you can accomplish the same thing using `FROM` and `WHERE`.

 `LEFT OUTER JOIN` returns all rows in the qualified Cartesian product, that is, all combined rows that pass its join condition. It also returns one copy of each row in the left-hand table for which there was no right-hand row that passed the join condition. This left-hand row is extended to the full width of the joined table by inserting null values for the right-hand columns. Only the `JOIN` clause’s own condition is considered while deciding which rows have matches. Outer conditions are applied afterwards.

 Conversely, `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` returns all the joined rows plus one row for each unmatched right-hand row extended with nulls on the left. This is a notational convenience, since you can convert it to a `LEFT OUTER JOIN` by switching the left and right inputs.

 `FULL OUTER JOIN` returns all the joined rows, one row for each unmatched left-hand row extended with nulls on the right, and one row for each unmatched right-hand row extended with nulls on the left.

`ON join_condition`

 `join_condition` is an expression resulting in a value of type `BOOLEAN` (similar to a `WHERE` clause) that specifies the rows in a join that are considered to match.

`USING (join_column [, ...] )`

 A clause of the form `USING (a, b, ... )` is shorthand for `ON left_table.a = right_table.a AND left_table.b = right_table.b ....` Also, `USING` implies that only one of each pair of equivalent columns is included in the join output, not both.

`NATURAL`

 `NATURAL` is shorthand for a `USING` list that mentions all columns in the two tables that have the same names.

If you specify multiple sources, the result is the Cartesian product (cross join) of all the sources. Usually qualification conditions are added to restrict the returned rows to a small subset of the Cartesian product.

### Example

This example selects all of the entries from the `dept` table:

```sql
SELECT * FROM dept;
__OUTPUT__
deptno |  dname      |  loc
-------+-------------+-----------
    10 |  ACCOUNTING |  NEW YORK
    20 |  RESEARCH   |  DALLAS
    30 |  SALES      |  CHICAGO
    40 | OPERATIONS  |  BOSTON
 (4 rows)
```

## WHERE clause

The optional `WHERE` clause has the form:

```sql
WHERE condition
```

where `condition` is any expression that evaluates to a result of type `BOOLEAN`. Any row that doesn't satisfy this condition is eliminated from the output. A row satisfies the condition if it returns `TRUE` when the actual row values are substituted for any variable references.

### Example

This example joins the contents of the `emp` and `dept` tables. The value of the `deptno` column in the `emp` table is equal to the value of the `deptno` column in the `deptno` table.

```sql
SELECT d.deptno, d.dname, e.empno, e.ename, e.mgr, e.hiredate
    FROM emp e, dept d
    WHERE d.deptno = e.deptno;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |   dname    | empno | ename  | mgr  |      hiredate

     30 | SALES      |  7900 | JAMES  | 7698 | 03-DEC-81 00:00:00
(14 rows)
```

## GROUP BY clause

The optional `GROUP BY` clause has the form:

```sql
GROUP BY { expression | ROLLUP ( expr_list ) |
  CUBE ( expr_list ) | GROUPING SETS ( expr_list ) } [, ...]
```

`GROUP BY` condenses all selected rows that share the same values for the grouped expressions into a single row. `expression` can be an input column name or the name or ordinal number of an output column (`SELECT` list item). Or it can be an arbitrary expression formed from input-column values. In case of ambiguity, a `GROUP BY` name is interpreted as an input-column name rather than an output column name.

`ROLLUP`, `CUBE`, and `GROUPING SETS` are extensions to the `GROUP BY` clause for supporting multidimensional analysis.

Aggregate functions, if any are used, are computed across all rows making up each group, producing a separate value for each group. Without `GROUP BY`, an aggregate produces a single value computed across all the selected rows. When `GROUP BY` is present, it isn't valid for the `SELECT` list expressions to refer to ungrouped columns except in aggregate functions, since there is more than one possible value to return for an ungrouped column.

### Example

This example computes the sum of the `sal` column in the `emp` table, grouping the results by department number:

```sql
SELECT deptno, SUM(sal) AS total
    FROM emp
    GROUP BY deptno;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |  total
--------+----------
     10 |  8750.00
     20 | 10875.00
     30 |  9400.00
(3 rows)
```

## HAVING clause

The optional `HAVING` clause has the form:

```sql
HAVING condition
```

Where `condition` is the same as specified for the `WHERE` clause.

`HAVING` eliminates group rows that don't satisfy the specified condition. `HAVING` is different from `WHERE`. `WHERE` filters individual rows before applying `GROUP BY`, while `HAVING` filters group rows created by `GROUP BY`. Each column referenced in `condition` must unambiguously reference a grouping column, unless the reference appears in an aggregate function.

### Example

Sum the column `sal` of all employees, group the results by department number, and show those group totals that are less than 10000:

```sql
SELECT deptno, SUM(sal) AS total
    FROM emp
    GROUP BY deptno
    HAVING SUM(sal) < 10000;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |  total
--------+---------
     10 | 8750.00
     30 | 9400.00
(2 rows)
```

## SELECT List

The `SELECT` list (between the keywords `SELECT` and `FROM`) specifies expressions that form the output rows of the `SELECT` statement. The expressions can refer to columns computed in the `FROM` clause, and they usually do. Using the clause `AS output_name`, you can specify another name for an output column. This name is primarily used to label the column for display. You can also use it to refer to the column’s value in `ORDER BY` and `GROUP BY` clauses but not in the `WHERE` or `HAVING` clauses. In those clauses, you must write out the expression.

Instead of an expression, you can write \* in the output list as a shorthand for all the columns of the selected rows.

### Example

The `SELECT` list in this example specifies for the result set to include the `empno` column, the `ename` column, the `mgr` column, and the `hiredate` column:

```sql
SELECT empno, ename, mgr, hiredate FROM emp;
__OUTPUT__
 empno | ename  | mgr  |      hiredate
-------+--------+------+--------------------
  7934 | MILLER | 7782 | 23-JAN-82 00:00:00
  7782 | CLARK  | 7839 | 09-JUN-81 00:00:00
  7839 | KING   |      | 17-NOV-81 00:00:00
  7788 | SCOTT  | 7566 | 19-APR-87 00:00:00
  7566 | JONES  | 7839 | 02-APR-81 00:00:00
  7369 | SMITH  | 7902 | 17-DEC-80 00:00:00
  7876 | ADAMS  | 7788 | 23-MAY-87 00:00:00
  7902 | FORD   | 7566 | 03-DEC-81 00:00:00
  7521 | WARD   | 7698 | 22-FEB-81 00:00:00
  7844 | TURNER | 7698 | 08-SEP-81 00:00:00
  7499 | ALLEN  | 7698 | 20-FEB-81 00:00:00
  7698 | BLAKE  | 7839 | 01-MAY-81 00:00:00
  7654 | MARTIN | 7698 | 28-SEP-81 00:00:00
  7900 | JAMES  | 7698 | 03-DEC-81 00:00:00
(14 rows)
```

## UNION clause

The `UNION` clause has the form:

```sql
select_statement UNION [ ALL ] select_statement
```

Where `select_statement` is any `SELECT` statement without an `ORDER BY` or `FOR UPDATE` clause. You can attach `ORDER BY` to a sub-expression if you enclose it in parentheses. Without parentheses, these clauses apply to the result of the `UNION`, not to its right-hand input expression.

The `UNION` operator computes the set union of the rows returned by the involved `SELECT` statements. A row is in the set union of two result sets if it appears in at least one of the result sets. The two `SELECT` statements that represent the direct operands of the `UNION` must produce the same number of columns, and corresponding columns must have compatible data types.

The result of `UNION` doesn't contain any duplicate rows unless you specify the `ALL` option. `ALL` prevents eliminating duplicates.

Without parentheses, multiple `UNION` operators in the same `SELECT` statement are evaluated left to right.

Currently, you can't specify `FOR UPDATE` either for a `UNION` result or for any input of a `UNION`.

## INTERSECT clause

The `INTERSECT` clause has the form:

```sql
select_statement INTERSECT select_statement
```

Where `select_statement` is any `SELECT` statement without an `ORDER BY` or `FOR UPDATE` clause.

The `INTERSECT` operator computes the set intersection of the rows returned by the involved `SELECT` statements. A row is in the intersection of two result sets if it appears in both result sets.

The result of `INTERSECT` doesn't contain any duplicate rows.

Without parentheses, multiple `INTERSECT` operators in the same `SELECT` statement are evaluated left to right. `INTERSECT` binds more tightly than `UNION`. That is, `A UNION B INTERSECT C` is read as `A UNION (B INTERSECT C)`.

## MINUS clause

The `MINUS` clause has this general form:

```sql
select_statement MINUS select_statement
```

Where `select_statement` is any `SELECT` statement without an `ORDER BY` or `FOR UPDATE` clause.

The `MINUS` operator computes the set of rows that are in the result of the left `SELECT` statement but not in the result of the right one.

The result of `MINUS` doesn't contain any duplicate rows.

Without parentheses, multiple `MINUS` operators in the same `SELECT` statement are evaluated left to right. `MINUS` binds at the same level as `UNION`.

## CONNECT BY clause

The `CONNECT BY` clause determines the parent-child relationship of rows when performing a hierarchical query. It has the general form:

```sql
CONNECT BY { PRIOR parent_expr = child_expr |
  child_expr = PRIOR parent_expr }
```

Where `parent_expr` is evaluated on a candidate parent row. If `parent_expr = child_expr` results in `TRUE` for a row returned by the `FROM` clause, then this row is considered a child of the parent.

You can specify the following optional clauses with the `CONNECT BY` clause.

`START WITH start_expression`

 The rows returned by the `FROM` clause on which `start_expression` evaluates to `TRUE` become the root nodes of the hierarchy.

`ORDER SIBLINGS BY expression [ ASC | DESC ] [, ...]`

 Sibling rows of the hierarchy are ordered by `expression` in the result set.

!!! Note
    EDB Postgres Advanced Server doesn't support the use of `AND` or other operators in the `CONNECT BY` clause.

## ORDER BY clause

The optional `ORDER BY` clause has the form:

```sql
ORDER BY expression [ ASC | DESC ] [, ...]
```

Where `expression` can be the name or ordinal number of an output column (`SELECT` list item), or it can be an arbitrary expression formed from input-column values.

The `ORDER BY` clause sorts the result rows according to the specified expressions. If two rows are equal according to the left-most expression, they are compared according to the next expression, and so on. If they are equal according to all specified expressions, they are returned in an implementation-dependent order.

The ordinal number refers to the ordinal (left-to-right) position of the result column. This feature makes it possible to define an ordering on the basis of a column that doesn't have a unique name. This is never required because you can always assign a name to a result column using the `AS` clause.

You also can use arbitrary expressions in the `ORDER BY` clause, including columns that don't appear in the `SELECT` result list. Thus the following statement is valid:

```sql
SELECT ename FROM emp ORDER BY empno;
```

A limitation of this feature is that an `ORDER BY` clause applying to the result of a `UNION`, `INTERSECT`, or `MINUS` clause can specify only an output column name or number, not an expression.

If an `ORDER BY` expression is a simple name that matches both a result column name and an input column name, `ORDER BY` interprets it as the result column name. This behavior is the opposite of the choice that `GROUP BY` makes in the same situation. This inconsistency is compatible with the SQL standard.

Optionally, you can add the key word `ASC` (ascending) or `DESC` (descending) after any expression in the `ORDER BY` clause. `ASC` is the default.

The null value sorts higher than any other value. In other words, with ascending sort order, null values sort at the end. With descending sort order, null values sort at the beginning.

Character-string data is sorted according to the locale-specific collation order that was established when the database cluster was initialized.

!!! Note
    If you specify `SELECT DISTINCT` or if a `SELECT` statement includes the `SELECT DISTINCT ...ORDER BY` clause, then all the expressions in `ORDER BY` must be present in the select list of the `SELECT DISTINCT` query.

## Examples

These examples sort the individual results according to the contents of the second column (`dname`):

```sql
SELECT * FROM dept ORDER BY dname;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
(4 rows)
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM dept ORDER BY 2;
__OUTPUT__
 deptno |   dname    |   loc
--------+------------+----------
     10 | ACCOUNTING | NEW YORK
     40 | OPERATIONS | BOSTON
     20 | RESEARCH   | DALLAS
     30 | SALES      | CHICAGO
(4 rows)
```

This example uses the `SELECT DISTINCT ...ORDER BY` clause to fetch the `job` and `deptno` from table `emp`:

```sql
CREATE TABLE EMP(EMPNO NUMBER(4) NOT NULL,
ENAME VARCHAR2(10),
JOB VARCHAR2(9),
DEPTNO NUMBER(2));
```

```sql
INSERT INTO EMP VALUES (7369, 'SMITH', 'CLERK', 20);
INSERT 0 1
INSERT INTO EMP VALUES (7499, 'ALLEN', 'SALESMAN', 30);
INSERT 0 1
INSERT INTO EMP VALUES (7521, 'WARD', 'SALESMAN', 30);
INSERT 0 1
INSERT INTO EMP VALUES (7566, 'JONES', 'MANAGER', 20);
INSERT 0 1
```

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT e.job, e.deptno FROM emp e ORDER BY e.job, e.deptno;
__OUTPUT__
 job      | deptno
----------+--------
 CLERK    |     20
 MANAGER  |     20
 SALESMAN |     30
(3 rows)
```

## DISTINCT | UNIQUE clause

If a `SELECT` statement specifies `DISTINCT` or `UNIQUE`, all duplicate rows are removed from the result set. One row is kept from each group of duplicates. The `DISTINCT` or `UNIQUE` clauses are synonymous when used with a `SELECT` statement. The `ALL` keyword specifies the opposite, which is that all rows are kept (the default).

Error messages resulting from the improper use of a `SELECT` statement that includes the `DISTINCT` or `UNIQUE` keywords include both the `DISTINCT | UNIQUE` keywords:

```sql
psql: ERROR: FOR UPDATE is not allowed with DISTINCT/UNIQUE clause
```

## FOR UPDATE clause

The `FOR UPDATE` clause takes the form:

```sql
FOR UPDATE [WAIT n|NOWAIT|SKIP LOCKED]
```

`FOR UPDATE` causes the rows retrieved by the `SELECT` statement to be locked as though for update. This prevents a row from being modified or deleted by other transactions until the current transaction ends. Any transaction that attempts to `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `SELECT FOR UPDATE` a selected row is blocked until the current transaction ends. If an `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `SELECT FOR UPDATE` from another transaction has already locked a selected row or rows, `SELECT FOR UPDATE` waits for the first transaction to complete. It then locks and returns the updated row, or it returns no row if the row was deleted.

You can't use `FOR UPDATE` in contexts where you can't clearly identify returned rows with individual table rows, for example, with aggregation.

Use `FOR UPDATE` options to specify locking preferences:

-   Include the `WAIT n` keywords to specify the number of seconds or fractional seconds for the `SELECT` statement to wait for a row locked by another session. Use a decimal form to specify fractional seconds. For example, `WAIT 1.5` waits one and a half seconds. Specify up to four digits to the right of the decimal.
-   Include the `NOWAIT` keyword to report an error immediately if the current session can't lock a row.
-   Include `SKIP LOCKED` to lock rows, if possible, and skip rows that are already locked by another session.
