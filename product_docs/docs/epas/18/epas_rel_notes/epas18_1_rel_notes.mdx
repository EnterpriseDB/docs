| Upstream merge | Merged with community PostgreSQL 18.1. See the [PostgreSQL 18.1 Release Notes](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/release/18.1/) for more information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                 |
| Feature        | Added the `INACTIVE_ACCOUNT_TIME` option to password profiles. The new Automated Inactive Account Locking feature enhances database security by mitigating risks from dormant user accounts. It allows security administrators to configure a profile (for example, `INACTIVE_ACCOUNT_TIME 60`) that automatically locks accounts that haven't logged in for a predefined number of days. This prevents potential misuse of stale accounts, streamlining compliance and reducing the database's attack surface without requiring manual tracking.         |                 |
| Feature        | Added the ability to redact statements containing passwords in the server logs. To address unreliable password redaction, we are exploring a new approach that uses the post-parsing command tree instead of raw string analysis. This method would reliably match all password-changing commands (for example, `ALTER USER`) using a GUC like `edb_log_redact_password_statements`. While this prevents malicious code from bypassing redaction, it requires redacting the entire command string, which may hide other commands executed simultaneously. |                 |
| Feature        | Added the ability to obfuscate passwords in `postgres_fdw` user mappings. We've enhanced security for `postgres_fdw` by obfuscating passwords stored in `PG_USER_MAPPING`. This change ensures that passwords are no longer stored in plaintext within the catalog, even from other superusers, and aligns the security implementation with our existing OCI dblink standard.                                                                                                                                                                             |                 |
| Feature        | Added support for the Oracle-equivalent `NLSSORT()`. To enhance Oracle compatibility, we've implemented the `NLSSORT()` function transformation. This allows the system to correctly interpret Oracle's NLS parameters and translate them into a PostgreSQL `CollateClause`. This change ensures applications correctly perform collation-aware sorting based on locale rules, significantly improving migration fidelity.                                                                                                                                |                 |
| Enhancement    | Added support for Secure(TLS) and Authenticated(AUTH) email to `UTL_SMTP`. Database Administrators migrating from Oracle can now ensure secure email communications with the new `UTL_SMTP` support for `AUTH` and `STARTTLS`. This implementation allows for standard SMTP authentication and enables TLS/SSL encryption of email sessions, helping your applications maintain security policies and compliance.                                                                                                                                         |                 |
| Enhancement    | Added support to audit nested statements to edb_audit. We've enhanced database security by implementing nested statement audit logging. A new configuration parameter, `edb_audit_nested_statements`, allows administrators to capture statements executed within functions and procedures. This enhancement ensures complete audit trails, effectively preventing malicious users from bypassing security logs through hidden code execution.                                                                                                            |                 |
| Enhancement    | Enabled an `edb_audit_group` related option for system catalog tables. We've enhanced security by enabling the `edb_audit_group` relation option for system catalog tables. This allows users to apply fine-grained audit rules for critical system objects (like monitoring `SELECT` statements on sensitive tables). Enabling this option for catalog tables allows users to define highly specific tracking rules for critical system objects.                                                                                                         |                 |
| Enhancement    | Added support to audit `COPY` commands. We've enhanced `edb_audit` to include explicit support for logging the `COPY` statement option into `edb_audit_statement`. This critical update allows users to audit `COPY` commands to sensitive tables.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |                 |
| Enhancement    | Improved calendar-based scheduling in `DBMS_SCHEDULER`. We've significantly enhanced `DBMS_SCHEDULER` with new calendar-based scheduling features for greater precision and flexibility. This includes support for the `FREQ=SECONDLY` interval (for sub-minute jobs), the `INTERVAL` keyword, and negative `BYMONTHDAY` values (to schedule jobs based on the end of the month).                                                                                                                                                                         |                 |
| Enhancement    | Added Indicator Array support for both Oracle Dynamic SQL Method 4 and the ANSI Dynamic SQL Method 4 in ECPGPlus. This enhancement now allows developers to efficiently handle `NULL` values by using parallel arrays of indicator values alongside arrays of data values. This significantly enhances the flexibility and performance of data binding and transfer in applications that utilize embedded SQL.                                                                                                                                             |                 |
| Enhancement    | Improved `sqlcode` for `INSERT` statement in ECPGPlus. Now while using `MODE = -C PROC`, an `INSERT` statement returns `sqlcode = 0` upon successful execution, even if zero rows are inserted. This return code confirms that the statement is processed without error, even if zero rows are inserted.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |                 |
| Enhancement    | Improved `sqlcode` for `FETCH` statement in ECPGPlus. Now while using `MODE = -C PROC`, a `FETCH` statement returns `sqlcode = 100` when less number of rows are returned than requested rows. This return code signifies that the cursor has reached the end of the result set and no further data is available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |                 |
| Enhancement    | Added support for `ALTER [PUBLIC] DATABASE LINK` syntax. Database Administrators required a safe way to modify existing database link details without service disruption. We've introduced the `ALTER [PUBLIC] DATABASE LINK` command to simplify maintenance tasks. This new command allows for in-place updates, preventing the need to drop and recreate database links that have complex dependent objects, thereby enhancing stability and operational safety.                                                                                       |                 |
| Enhancement    | Added the ability for pg_dump to dump ACL changes for `SYS` schema objects. We've enhanced pg_dump to reliably capture ACL (permission) changes for both system and user-defined objects within the `SYS` schema. Since system objects are now pinned, this change ensures that custom permissions set on crucial system objects are fully preserved during dump and restore operations.                                                                                                                                                                  |                 |
| Change         | Replaced EDB Postgres Advanced Server-specific boolean columns in `pg_authid` with the integer bitmask. To simplify catalog management and support future extensions, several EDB Postgres Advanced Server-specific boolean privilege columns in `pg_authid` have been consolidated into a single integer bitmask column (`rolredwoodprivs`). This enhancement reduces column sprawl and improves extensibility, while new SQL functions, for example `has_priv-name_privilege()`, allow easy checking of user privileges.                                |                 |
| Bug&nbsp;fix   | Fixed column name casing issue to fetch `resultset` correctly from the remote server. We've enhanced `edb_dblink_oci` to utilize the `column_name` option in foreign table definitions when building remote queries. This allows users to map local column names to different column names on the remote table, addressing potential naming and case conflicts. The change ensures accurate data retrieval and improves interoperability between PostgreSQL and Oracle-compatible environments.                                                           |                 |
