<div id="automatic_list_partitioning" class="registered_link"></div>

Automatic list partitioning is an extension to `LIST` partitioning that allows a database to create a partition for any new distinct value of the list partitioning key. A new partition is created when data is inserted into the `LIST` partitioned table and the inserted value doesn't match any of the existing table partition. Use the `AUTOMATIC` clause to implement automatic list partitioning.

For example, consider a table named `sales` with a `sales_state` column that contains the existing partition values `CALIFORNIA` and `FLORIDA`. Each of the `sales_state` values increases with a rise in the statewise sales. A sale in a new state, for example, `INDIANA` and `OHIO`, requires creating new partitions. If you implement automatic list partitioning, the new partitions `INDIANA` and `OHIO` are automatically created, and data is entered into the `sales` table.

For information about automatic list partitioning syntax, see [CREATE TABLE...PARTITION BY](../../../reference/oracle_compatibility_reference/04_partitioning_commands_compatible_with_oracle_databases/01_create_table_partition_by/).

## Restrictions for automatic list partitioning

The following restrictions apply to the `AUTOMATIC` clause:

-   A table that enables automatic list partitioning can't have a `DEFAULT` partition.
-   Automatic list partitioning doesn't support multi-column list partitioning.
-   In composite partitioning, the automatic list partitioning can be useful as a primary partitioning mechanism but isn't supported at the subpartition level.
