Generally, you must declare all variables used in a block in the declaration section of the block. A variable declaration consists of a name that's assigned to the variable and its data type. Optionally, you can initialize the variable to a default value in the variable declaration.

## Syntax 

The general syntax of a variable declaration is:

```sql
<name> <type> [ { := | DEFAULT } { <expression> | NULL } ];
```

`name` is an identifier assigned to the variable.

`type` is the data type assigned to the variable.

`[ := expression ]`, if given, specifies the initial value assigned to the variable when the block is entered. If the clause isn't given then the variable is initialized to the SQL `NULL` value.

The default value is evaluated every time the block is entered. So, for example, assigning `SYSDATE` to a variable of type `DATE` causes the variable to have the time of the current invocation, not the time when the procedure or function was precompiled.

## Example: Variable declarations that use defaults

This procedure shows some variable declarations that use defaults consisting of string and numeric expressions:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE PROCEDURE dept_salary_rpt (
    p_deptno        NUMBER
)
IS
    todays_date     DATE := SYSDATE;
    rpt_title       VARCHAR2(60) := 'Report For Department # ' || p_deptno
                             || ' on ' || todays_date;
    base_sal        INTEGER := 35525;
    base_comm_rate  NUMBER := 1.33333;
    base_annual     NUMBER := ROUND(base_sal * base_comm_rate, 2);
BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(rpt_title);
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Base Annual Salary: ' || base_annual);
END;
```

The following output of the procedure shows that default values in the variable declarations are assigned to the variables:

```sql
EXEC dept_salary_rpt(20);
__OUTPUT__
Report For Department # 20 on 10-JUL-07 16:44:45
Base Annual Salary: 47366.55
```
