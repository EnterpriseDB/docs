<div id="using_forward_declarations" class="registered_link"></div>

When you want to invoke a subprogram, you must declare it in the hierarchy of blocks in the standalone program prior to where you invoke it. In other words, when scanning the SPL code from beginning to end, the subprogram declaration must appear before its invocation.

However, you can construct the SPL code so that the full declaration of the subprogram appears in the SPL code after the point in the code where it's invoked. (The full declaration includes its optional declaration section, its mandatory executable section, and optional exception section.) 

You can do this by inserting a *forward declaration* in the SPL code prior to its invocation. The forward declaration is the specification of a subprocedure or subfunction name, formal parameters, and return type if it's a subfunction.

You must specify the full subprogram consisting of the optional declaration section, the executable section, and the optional exception section in the same declaration section as the forward declaration. However it can appear following other subprogram declarations that invoke this subprogram with the forward declaration.

Typical use of a forward declaration is when two subprograms invoke each other:

```sql
DECLARE
    FUNCTION add_one (
        p_add       IN NUMBER
    ) RETURN NUMBER;
    FUNCTION test_max (
        p_test      IN NUMBER)
    RETURN NUMBER
    IS
    BEGIN
        IF p_test < 5 THEN
            RETURN add_one(p_test);
        END IF;
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT('Final value is ');
        RETURN p_test;
    END;
    FUNCTION add_one (
        p_add       IN NUMBER)
    RETURN NUMBER
    IS
    BEGIN
        DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE('Increase by 1');
        RETURN test_max(p_add + 1);
    END;
BEGIN
    DBMS_OUTPUT.PUT_LINE(test_max(3));
END;
```

Subfunction `test_max` invokes subfunction `add_one`, which also invokes subfunction `test_max`. A forward declaration is required for one of the subprograms, which is implemented for `add_one` at the beginning of the anonymous block declaration section.

The resulting output from the anonymous block is as follows:

```sql
__OUTPUT__
Increase by 1
Increase by 1
Final value is 5
```
