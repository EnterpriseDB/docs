## `pwr` configuration file

To reduce the number of command-line arguments needed when executing `pwr`, you can use a configuration file to specify options that always have the same value and whose values differ from the default.

During execution, `pwr` looks for an existing configuration file in `~/.pwr.conf` and `/etc/pwr.conf`, in that order, and uses the first one found.
However, if the `--config` option specifies a configuration file, that value overrides the default locations.

The installation package creates a template for the configuration file in `/etc/pwr.conf.templ`. We recommend copying this file to one of the
two places where `pwr` looks for a configuration file and editing the options in the template as necessary.

You can configure the following options.

### `input_dir`

Identifies an existing directory where the `edb_wait_states` contents of a Lasso report are located. This option is used mainly for `pwr report` execution (see [Using Postgres Workload Report](using)).

### `output_dir`

Specifies where to output reports. During execution, Postgres Workload Report tries to create the directory if it doesn't exist.

### `report_name`

Provides the name of the report files generated. Usually, you specify this option from the command line because different reports typically have different names.

### `log_file`

Provides the full path to the file where PWR writes the `stdout` and `stderr` logs.

### `log_level`

Specifies the logging level to use when running Postgres Workload Report. The following are valid values, listed from more verbose to less verbose: 

    `DEBUG`
    `INFO` (default if not specified)
    `WARNING`
    `ERROR`
    `CRITICAL`

See [the Python logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging-levels) documentation for more information about log levels.

### `log_format`

Provides the format of the log messages that are written to the log file. See [the Python logging](https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logrecord-attributes) documentation for more information on log formatting.

### `assets_dir`

Identifies the directory where you can find the Jinja templates used to format the HTML output and the CSS used for PDF output. Typically, the directory to use by default is `/usr/share/pwr/assets`, which contains the assets provided with the `edb-pwr` package.
