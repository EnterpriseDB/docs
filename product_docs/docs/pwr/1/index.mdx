Postgres Workload Report (PWR) is a Python-based tool used for building PostgreSQL workload reports in HTML, Markdown, DOCX, and PDF mode. These reports mimic the reports provided by the Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) reporting tool from Oracle.

Using a Postgres connection, you can execute Postgres Workload Report from any machine with access to the server for which you want a report. Postgres Workload Report uses Lasso for collecting data, so Lasso is a prerequisite. The `edb-pwr` package has an explicit dependency on `edb-lasso` being installed.

On the Postgres server, you must have `edb_wait_states` version 1.2 or later installed and loaded. You must also create the extension,
preferably on the main database, so the `edb_wait_states` functions are available for Postgres Workload Report to collect saved snapshot data.
