Postgres Workload Report is provided as a Python source distributed package for all supported operating systems. You can find it in the `enterprise` and `standard` repositories.

The following command installs Postgres Workload Report and, if necessary, also pulls the `edb-lasso` package from the repository and installs it:

```shell
