## Prerequisites

Postgres Workload Report can provide reports for Postgres servers only where the `edb_wait_states` extension, version 1.2 or later, is loaded. Furthermore, PWR can provide query wait reports only for intervals of time when the `edb_wait_states` extension was loaded on the server.

For more information, see [`edb_wait_states`](/pg_extensions/wait_states/).

## Source information for reports

After the `edb-pwr` and `edb-lasso` packages are installed on the machine, and the server has been running with the `edb_wait_states` extension loaded for a long enough period of time, you can use Postgres Workload Report to extract reports of wait states for the queries that were running during the interval of time specified.

Alternatively, Postgres Workload Report can generate reports from an existing Lasso report, assuming the report was executed on a server with `edb_wait_states` loaded. For this reason, Postgres Workload Report has a mandatory first argument, which can be either of the following:

- `execute` &mdash; Performs end-to-end execution. It calls `lasso` with appropriate options and uses the generated tarball report as the input to generate an HTML, Markdown, DOCX, or PDF report.
- `report` &mdash; Uses the directory for the stored `lasso` report contents as input for processing and generating the wait states report. Before you can use the `report` argument, a decompressed and untarred `lasso` report must already exist. 

## Example for the `execute` option

This example generates a report on query waits for the Postgres server `myserver` for the interval between January 10th at 9:00 and January 10th at 13:00. An incident happened around that time that must be investigated to provide a root cause. The main database on the server where `edb_wait_states` is installed is `my-oltp`.

To get the report in HTML format, use the following command:

```shell
pwr execute --host-name myserver --sampling-start '2024-01-10 09:00+00' \
    --sampling-end '2024-01-10 13:00+00' --html \
    --report-name 'Jan10_incident' my-oltp postgres 
```

Run `pwr execute -h` to get the full list of options available.

## Example for the `report` option

In some cases, you already have a Lasso report and want PWR to use the Lasso report as the source and build a report based on it. For these cases, the `pwr report` option is useful.

This example uses the same scenario already described but uses a Lasso report that was executed using the time boundaries in the previous example. Suppose that the Lasso report's name is `edb-lasso-Jan10-incident.tar.bz2` and is located in the home directory of the machine where `pwr report` will be executed.

The following commands generate an HTML report saved in `~/pwr_output/Jan10_incident.html`:

```shell
cd ~/
mkdir -p pwr_tmp/
tar jxf ../edb-lasso-Jan10-incident.tar.bz2 -C ~/pwr_tmp/ --strip-components=1
pwr report \
    --input-dir ~/pwr_tmp/postgresql/dbs/my-oltp/edb_wait_states/ \
    --html --output-dir ~/pwr_output/ --report-name 'Jan10_incident'
```

Run `pwr report -h` to get the full list of options available.
