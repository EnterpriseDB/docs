## Prerequisites

Postgres Workload Report can only provide reports for Postgres servers where the `edb_wait_states` extension, version 1.2 or later, is loaded. Furthermore, PWR can only provide query wait reports for intervals of time when the `edb_wait_states` extension was loaded on the server.

For more information, see [`edb_wait_states`](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pg_extensions/wait_states/).

## Source information for reports

After the `edb-pwr` and `edb-lasso` packages are installed on the machine, and the server has been running with the `edb_wait_states` extension loaded for a long enough period of time, you can use PWR to extract reports of wait states for the queries that were running during the interval of time specified.

Alternatively, PWR can generate reports from an existing Lasso report, assuming the report was executed on a server with `edb_wait_states` loaded. For this reason PWR has a mandatory first argument, which can be either of the following
two:

- `execute`
- `report`

The `execute` argument performs end-to-end execution, calling `lasso` with appropriate options and using the generated tarball report as the input
to generate an HTML, Markdown, DOCX, or PDF report.

To use the `report` argument, a decompressed and untarred `lasso` report must exist. The directory for storing `lasso`
report contents is used as input for processing and generating the wait states report.

## Example for the `execute` option

Consider the following example. We need a report on query waits for the Postgres server `myserver` (the main database on the server where
`edb_wait_states` is installed is `my-oltp`) for the interval between January 10th at 9:00 and January 10th at 13:00. An incident happened
around that time which must be investigated to provide a root cause.

To get such a report in HTML format we would use the following command:

```shell
pwr execute --host-name myserver --sampling-start '2024-01-10 09:00+00' \
    --sampling-end '2024-01-10 13:00+00' --html \
    --report-name 'Jan10_incident' my-oltp postgres 
```

We can run `pwr execute -h` to get the full output of options available.

## Example for the `report` option

In some cases you may already have a Lasso report and would like PWR to use the Lasso report as the source and build a report based on it. For these cases, the `pwr report` option is useful.

We can use the same example already described but using a Lasso report that has already been executed using the time boundaries shared above. Let's suppose that the Lasso report's name is `edb-lasso-Jan10-incident.tar.bz2` and it is located in the home directory of the machine where `pwr report` will be executed.

The following command executions generate an HTML report saved in
`~/pwr_output/Jan10_incident.html`:

```shell
cd ~/
mkdir -p pwr_tmp/
tar jxf ../edb-lasso-Jan10-incident.tar.bz2 -C ~/pwr_tmp/ --strip-components=1
pwr report \
    --input-dir ~/pwr_tmp/postgresql/dbs/my-oltp/edb_wait_states/ \
    --html --output-dir ~/pwr_output/ --report-name 'Jan10_incident'
```

We can run `pwr report -h` to get the full output for the options available.
