Postgres Workload Report (PWR) is a Python-based tool used for building PostgreSQL workload reports in HTML, Markdown, DOCX, and PDF mode, mimicking the reports provided by the Automatic Workload Repository (AWR) reporting tool from Oracle.

Using a Postgres connection, you can execute PWR from any machine with access to the server for which you want a report. PWR uses Lasso for collecting data, so Lasso is a prerequisite. The `edb-pwr` package has an explicit dependency on `edb-lasso` being installed.

On the Postgres server, you should have `edb_wait_states` version 1.2 or later installed and loaded. The extension also must be created,
preferably on the main database, so the `edb_wait_states` functions are available for PWR to collect saved snapshot data.
