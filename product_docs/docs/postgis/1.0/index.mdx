PostGIS is a PostgreSQL extension that allows you to store Geographic Information Systems (GIS) objects in an Advanced Server database. PostGIS includes functions for analyzing and processing GIS objects, and support for GiST-based R-Tree spatial indexes.

The complete documentation for PostGIS is added to your system during the installation, and is available online at the [PostGIS project site](http://postgis.net/documentation//).
