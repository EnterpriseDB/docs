## Uninstalling PostGIS on a Windows Host

The PostGIS graphical installer creates an uninstaller that you can use to remove PostGIS. The uninstaller is created in the installation directory that you have specified while installing PostGIS (default is `C:\Program Files\edb\as12`).

1.  Navigate into the directory that contains the uninstaller and assume superuser privileges. Open the uninstaller and click `Yes` to begin uninstalling PostGIS:
