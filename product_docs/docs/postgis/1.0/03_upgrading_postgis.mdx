This section outlines the process of upgrading PostGIS.

To upgrade between major versions, for example, to upgrade from 2.5.4 to 3.0.1, perform the following steps:

1.  Install PostGIS 3.0.1.

2.  To update extensions, connect to the database (where you have already added extensions) with the psql client application, and execute the following commands:
    
    ``` text
    edb=# alter extension postgis update TO “3.0.1”;
    WARNING:  unpackaging raster
    WARNING:  PostGIS Raster functionality has been unpackaged
    HINT:  type `SELECT postgis_extensions_upgrade(); to finish the upgrade. After upgrading, if you want to drop raster, run: DROP EXTENSION postgis_raster;
    ALTER EXTENSION
    edb=# SELECT postgis_extensions_upgrade();
    NOTICE:  Packaging extension postgis_raster
    NOTICE:  Updating extension postgis_topology from 2.5.4 to 3.0.1
    NOTICE:  Updating extension postgis_tiger_geocoder from 2.5.4 to 3.0.1
                        postgis_extensions_upgrade
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Upgrade completed, run SELECT postgis_full_version(); for details
