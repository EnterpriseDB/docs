This section walks you through the following upgrade examples:

- Example 1 - Explains how to Upgrade from PostGIS version 2.4.6 to PostGIS version 3.1.1 for EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 9.6.
- Example 2 - Explains how to upgrade from PostGIS version 2.4.6 for EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 9.6 to PostGIS version 3.1.1 for EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 13.

## Example 1

The following example walks you through the process of upgrading PostGIS version 2.4.6 to PostGIS version 3.1.1 for EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 9.6.

!!! Note
    
    It is assumed that you have created extensions for PostGIS version 2.4.6 already and EDB Advanced Sever 9.6 service is running.

1.  To upgrade PostGIS version 2.4.6 to PostGIS version 3.1.1 for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 9.6, assume the superprivilges and execute the following command:

    ```text
    yum upgrade edb-as96-postgis* -y
    ```

2. To update extensions, switch to an `enterprisedb` user, connect to the database (where you have already added extensions) with the psql client application, and execute the following commands:

    ```text
    edb=# alter extension postgis update to '3.1.1';
    WARNING: unpackaging raster
    WARNING: PostGIS Raster functionality has been unpackaged
    HINT: type `SELECT postgis_extensions_upgrade();` to finish the upgrade. After upgrading, if you want to drop raster, run: DROP EXTENSION postgis_raster;
    ALTER EXTENSION
    ```

    ```text
    edb=# alter extension address_standardizer update to '3.1.1';
    ALTER EXTENSION
    ```

    ```text
    edb=# SELECT postgis_extensions_upgrade();
    NOTICE: Updating extension postgis_sfcgal from 2.4.6 to 3.1.1
    NOTICE: Packaging extension postgis_raster
    NOTICE: Updating extension postgis_topology from 2.4.6 to 3.1.1
    NOTICE: Updating extension postgis_tiger_geocoder from 2.4.6 to 3.1.1
              postgis_extensions_upgrade           
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Upgrade completed, run SELECT postgis_full_version(); for details
    (1 row)
    ```

## Example 2

The following example walks you through the process of upgrading PostGIS version 2.4.6 for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 9.6 to PostGIS version 3.1.1 for EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 13:

!!! Note

    You can upgrade to the PostGIS latest version only for the PostgreSQL version greater than or equal to 9.6. 

1.  Navigate to the bin directory of EDB Advanced Server 9.6:

    ```text
    cd /usr/edb/as9.6/bin/
    ```

    !!! Note
    
        It is assumed that you have created extensions for PostGIS version 2.4.6 already and EDB Advanced Sever 9.6 service is running.

2.  To upgrade PostGIS version 2.4.6 to PostGIS version 3.1.1 for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 9.6, assume the superprivilges and execute the following command:

    ```text
    yum upgrade edb-as96-postgis*
    ```

3. To update extensions, switch to an `enterprisedb` user, connect to the database (where you have already added extensions) with the psql client application, and execute the following commands:

    !!! Note

        The `enterprisedb` user is the default user created when you install the EDB Postgres Advanced Server. If you have created a new user for your database, you can switch to that user.

    ```text
    su enterprisedb

    ./psql -d edb -p 5444
    ```

    ```text
    edb=# alter extension postgis update to '3.1.1';
    WARNING: unpackaging raster
    WARNING: PostGIS Raster functionality has been unpackaged
    HINT: type `SELECT postgis_extensions_upgrade();` to finish the upgrade. After upgrading, if you want to drop raster, run: DROP EXTENSION postgis_raster;
    ALTER EXTENSION
    ```

    ```text
    edb=# alter extension address_standardizer update to '3.1.1';
    ALTER EXTENSION
    ```

    ```text
    edb=# SELECT postgis_extensions_upgrade();
    NOTICE: Updating extension postgis_sfcgal from 2.4.6 to 3.1.1
    NOTICE: Packaging extension postgis_raster
    NOTICE: Updating extension postgis_topology from 2.4.6 to 3.1.1
    NOTICE: Updating extension postgis_tiger_geocoder from 2.4.6 to 3.1.1
              postgis_extensions_upgrade           
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Upgrade completed, run SELECT postgis_full_version(); for details
    (1 row)
    ```

4. Assume the superuser priviliges to stop the EDB Postgres Advanced Server 9.6 service:

    ```text
    systemctl stop edb-as-9.6
    ```

5.  Install the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 13:

    ```text
    yum install edb-as13-server -y
    ```

6.  Navigate to the bin directory of EDB Advanced Server 13 and initialize the cluster:

    ```text
    cd /usr/edb/as13/bin/

    ./edb-as-13-setup initdb
    ```

7. Install the PostGIS version 3.1.1 for EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 13.0:

    ```text
    yum install edb-as13-postgis3 -y
    ```

8. Switch to an `enterprisedb` user and create a `temp` folder:

    ```text
    su enterprisedb
    cd $(mktemp -d)
    ```

9.  Execute the following commands to check cluster compatibility and consistency, as well as to perform the upgrade.

    ```text
    bash-4.2$ /usr/edb/as13/bin/pg_upgrade -d /var/lib/edb/as9.6/data/ -D /var/lib/edb/as13/data/ -U enterprisedb -b /usr/edb/as9.6/bin/ -B /usr/edb/as13/bin/ -p 5444 -P 5445 -c

    Performing Consistency Checks
    -----------------------------
    Checking cluster versions ok
    Checking database user is the install user ok
    Checking database connection settings ok
    Checking for prepared transactions ok
    Checking for reg* data types in user tables ok
    Checking for contrib/isn with bigint-passing mismatch ok
    Checking for tables WITH OIDS ok
    Checking for invalid "sql_identifier" user columns ok
    Checking for invalid "unknown" user columns ok
    Checking for hash indexes ok
    Checking for presence of required libraries ok
    Checking database user is the install user ok
    Checking for prepared transactions ok
    Checking for new cluster tablespace directories ok

    Clusters are compatible
    ```

    ```text
    bash-4.2$ /usr/edb/as13/bin/pg_upgrade -d /var/lib/edb/as9.6/data/ -D /var/lib/edb/as13/data/ -U enterprisedb -b /usr/edb/as9.6/bin/ -B /usr/edb/as13/bin/ -p 5444 -P 5445 --link

    Performing Consistency Checks
    -----------------------------
    Checking cluster versions ok
    Checking database user is the install user ok
    Checking database connection settings ok
    Checking for prepared transactions ok
    Checking for reg* data types in user tables ok
    Checking for contrib/isn with bigint-passing mismatch ok
    Checking for tables WITH OIDS ok
    Checking for invalid "sql_identifier" user columns ok
    Checking for invalid "unknown" user columns ok
    Creating dump of global objects ok
    Creating dump of database schemas
    ok
    Checking for presence of required libraries ok
    Checking database user is the install user ok
    Checking for prepared transactions ok
    Checking for new cluster tablespace directories ok

    If pg_upgrade fails after this point, you must re-initdb the
    new cluster before continuing.

    Performing Upgrade
    Analyzing all rows in the new cluster ok
    Freezing all rows in the new cluster ok
    Deleting files from new pg_xact ok
    Copying old pg_clog to new server ok
    Setting next transaction ID and epoch for new cluster ok
    Deleting files from new pg_multixact/offsets ok
    Copying old pg_multixact/offsets to new server ok
    Deleting files from new pg_multixact/members ok
    Copying old pg_multixact/members to new server ok
    Setting next multixact ID and offset for new cluster ok
    Resetting WAL archives ok
    Setting frozenxid and minmxid counters in new cluster ok
    Restoring global objects in the new cluster ok
    Restoring database schemas in the new cluster
    ok
    Adding ".old" suffix to old global/pg_control ok

    If you want to start the old cluster, you will need to remove
    the ".old" suffix from /var/lib/edb/as9.6/data/global/pg_control.old.
    Because "link" mode was used, the old cluster cannot be safely
    started once the new cluster has been started.

    Linking user relation files
    ok
    Setting next OID for new cluster ok
    Sync data directory to disk ok
    Creating script to analyze new cluster ok
    Creating script to delete old cluster ok
    Checking for hash indexes ok

    Upgrade Complete
    Optimizer statistics are not transferred by pg_upgrade so,
    once you start the new server, consider running:
    ./analyze_new_cluster.sh

    Running this script will delete the old cluster's data files:
    ./delete_old_cluster.sh
     ```

10. Assume the superuser priviliges, navigate to the `bin` directory of EDB Postgres Advanced Server 13, and start the service:

    ```text
    cd /usr/edb/as13/bin/

    systemctl start edb-as-13
    
    systemctl status edb-as-13
    ```

11. To update extensions, switch to an `enterprisedb` user, connect to the database (where you have already added extensions) with the psql client application, and execute the following commands:

    ```text
    su enterprisedb
    ./psql -d edb -p 5444
    edb=# SELECT PostGIS_Extensions_Upgrade(); 
    NOTICE: Updating extension postgis 3.1.1
          postgis_extensions_upgrade           
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
    Upgrade completed, run SELECT postgis_full_version(); for details
    (1 row)
    ```
