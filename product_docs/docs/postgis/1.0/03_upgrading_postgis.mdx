You can upgrade PostGIS for the same Advanced Server branch as well as for the different Advanced server branch.

The following example walks you through upgrading PostGIS from 2.5.4 to 3.0.2 of the same Advanced Server branch 11:

1.  Install PostGIS 3.0.2.

2.  To update extensions, connect to the database (where you have already added extensions) with the psql client application, and execute the following commands:

    ```text
    edb=# alter extension postgis update TO “3.0.2”;
    WARNING:  unpackaging raster
    WARNING:  PostGIS Raster functionality has been unpackaged
    HINT:  type `SELECT postgis_extensions_upgrade(); to finish the upgrade. After upgrading, if you want to drop raster, run: DROP EXTENSION postgis_raster;
    ALTER EXTENSION
    edb=# SELECT postgis_extensions_upgrade();
    NOTICE:  Packaging extension postgis_raster
    NOTICE:  Updating extension postgis_topology from 2.5.4 to 3.0.2
    NOTICE:  Updating extension postgis_tiger_geocoder from 2.5.4 to 3.0.2
                        postgis_extensions_upgrade
    -------------------------------------------------------------------
     Upgrade completed, run SELECT postgis_full_version(); for details
    (1 row)
    ```

The following example walks you through upgrading PostGIS from 2.5.4 for Advanced server 11 to 3.0.2 for Advanced server 12:

1.  Stop the EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11 server service:

    ```text
    systemctl stop edb-as-11
    ```

2.  Assume the superuser privileges and install the EDB Postgres Advanced Server 12 server:

    ```text
    yum install edb-as12-server
    ```

3.  Navigate to the bin directory and initialize the cluster:

    ```text
    ./edb-as-12-setup initdb
    ```

4.  Change the `pg_hba.conf` file authentication setting to `trust` (these should be reversed after compatibility check). For more information about modifying the `pg_hba.conf` file, see the PostgreSQL core documentation available at [PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html).

    ```text
    vi /var/lib/edb/as12/data/pg_hba.conf
    ```

    ```text
    # "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only

    local   all    all                trust

    # IPv4 local connections:

    host    all    all  127.0.0.1/32  trust
    ```

5.  Install the PostGIS package:

    ```text
    yum install edb-as12-postgis-2.5.4
    ```

6.  Set appropriate permissions to the `/tmp` directory:

    ```text
    chmod 777 /tmp
    ```

7.  Change the current directory to `tmp` and switch to an `enterprisedb` user:

    ```text
    cd /tmp

    su enterprisedb
    ```

8.  Execute the following command to upgrade to EDB Postgres Advanced Server 12:

    ```text
    /usr/edb/as12/bin/pg_upgrade -d /var/lib/edb/as11/data/ -D /var/lib/edb/as12/data/ -U enterprisedb -b /usr/edb/as11/bin/ -B /usr/edb/as12/bin/ -p 5444 -P 5445 -c

    /usr/edb/as12/bin/pg_upgrade -d /var/lib/edb/as11/data/ -D /var/lib/edb/as12/data/ -U enterprisedb -b /usr/edb/as11/bin/ -B /usr/edb/as12/bin/ -p 5444 -P 5445 --link
    ```

9.  Execute the following command to upgrade to PostGIS 3.0.2 for Advanced Server version 12:

    ```text
    yum upgrade edb-as12-postgis* -y
    ```

10. To update extensions, connect to the database (where you have already added extensions) with the psql client application, and execute the following commands:

    ```text
    edb=# alter extension postgis update to '3.0.2';

    HINT: type `SELECT postgis_extensions_upgrade(); to finish the upgrade. After upgrading, if you want to drop raster, run: DROP EXTENSION postgis_raster;
