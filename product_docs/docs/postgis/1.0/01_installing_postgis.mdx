The following table lists the latest PostGIS versions and their corresponding Advanced Server versions. The PostGIS version required by your Advanced Server installation is version-specific, but the documented and supported functionality of each version is the same. The information in this guide applies to each version listed in the table below.

## Installing PostGIS on a CentOS/RHEL Host

You must install Advanced Server before installing PostGIS. For details about installing and configuring Advanced Server, see [the EDB Postgres Advanced Server Installation Guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/p/edb-postgres-advanced-server).

The following steps provide detailed information about adding a repository configuration file to your system and installing PostGIS from an RPM package.

Before creating the repository configuration file, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, [visit this page](https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/../../../../../../../../../../images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf).

1.  Use the following command to create the repository configuration file:

On CentOS/RHEL 7:

> 
> 
> ``` text
> yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
> ```

On CentOS/RHEL 8:

> 
> 
> ``` text
> dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
> ```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`, which resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

2.  Use your choice of editor to open the file. Ensure that the value of the enabled parameter is `1` and the `<username>` and `<password>` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification are replaced with the username and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.
    
    ``` text
    [edb]
    name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
    baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
    ```

3.  Save the configuration file and exit the editor.

4.  Before installing PostGIS on a CentOS/RHEL 8 machine, you need to enable the `PowerTools` repo with the following command:
    
    ``` text
    dnf config-manager --set-enabled PowerTools
    ```

5.  Install `PostGIS` with one of the following platform-specific command:

On CentOS/RHEL 7:

> 
> 
> ``` text
> yum install edb-as<xx>-postgis-<y.y.y>
> ```

Where *\<xx\>* is the Advanced Server version and *\<y.y.y\>* is the PostGIS version you want to install. For example, to install PostGIS 3.0.1 on Advanced Server 12, execute the following command:

> 
> 
> ``` text
> yum install edb-as12-postgis-3.0.1
> ```

On CentOS/RHEL 8:

> 
> 
> ``` text
> dnf install edb-as<xx>-postgis-<y.y.y>
> ```

Where *\<xx\>* is the Advanced Server version and *\<y.y.y\>* is the PostGIS version you want to install. For example, to install PostGIS 3.0.1 on Advanced Server 12, execute the following command:

> 
> 
> ``` text
> dnf install edb-as12-postgis-3.0.1
> ```

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y` and press `Return` to continue.

After installing PostGIS with a package manager, please note that you must manually create a template database and the required PostGIS extension.

## Installing PostGIS on a Debian/Ubuntu Host

You must install Advanced Server before installing PostGIS. For details about installing and configuring Advanced Server, see [the EDB Postgres Advanced Server Installation Guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/p/edb-postgres-advanced-server).

To install a package on a Debian or Ubuntu host, you must have credentials to access the EnterpriseDB repository. If you need EnterpriseDB credentials, [visit the EnterpriseDB website](https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/../../../../../../../../../../images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf).

The following steps will walk you through using the EnterpriseDB repository to install a DEB package. When using the commands, replace the `username` and `password` with the credentials provided by EnterpriseDB.

1.  Assume superuser privileges:
    
    > 
    > 
    > ``` text
    > sudo su â€“
    > ```

2.  Configure the EnterpriseDB repository:
    
    > 
    > 
    > ``` text
    > sh -c 'echo "deb https://<username>:<password>@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
    > ```

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:
    
    > 
    > 
    > ``` text
    > apt-get install apt-transport-https
    > ```

4.  Add the EDB signing key:
    
    > 
    > 
    > ``` text
    > wget -q -O - https://<username>:<password>@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add -
    > ```

5.  Update the repository metadata:
    
    > 
    > 
    > ``` text
    > apt-get update
    > ```

6.  Install DEB package:
    
    > 
    > 
    > ``` text
    > apt-get install edb-as<xx>-postgis-<y.y>
    > ```
    > 
    > Where *\<xx\>* is the Advanced Server version and *\<y.y\>* is the PostGIS version you want to install.
    > 
    > For example, to install the PostGIS 3.0.1 package for Advanced Server 12, execute the following command:
    > 
    > ``` text
    > apt-get install edb-as12-postgis-3.0
    > ```
