EDB PostGIS is a PostgreSQL extension that allows you to store Geographic Information Systems (GIS) objects in an Advanced Server database. It includes functions for analyzing and processing GIS objects and support for GiST-based R-Tree spatial indexes.

The complete documentation for PostGIS is added to your system during the installation and is available online at the [PostGIS project site](https://postgis.net/documentation/).

## What's New ##

This release contains a merge with upstream, which includes the following bug fixes:

- Improved handling of more complex compound coordinate systems.
- The SRID in TopoGeometry is fixed for empty geometry objects.
- Improved message when no zip code is provided for `postgis_tiger_geocoder`.
- Axis flips are now done for a CRS when `Lat` is set as the first column. In other cases, EPSG database order is used.
- Support recent Proj versions that have removed `pj_get_release`.
- The tolerance is now adjusted to improve geodetic calculations.
- Fix on improper conversion of negative geographic azimuth to positive.
- Allow DBSCAN cluster to form when recordset length equal to minPoints.
- Ensure bounding boxes are refreshed after coordinate transforms.
- Fix raster issues related to PostgreSQL 14 tablefunc changes.
- Update to support Tiger 2020.
- Change Proj cache lifetime to last as long as connection.

For more information, please refer to the [Upstream release notes](https://postgis.net/docs/manual-3.1/release_notes.html#idm41899).

!!! Note
    To upgrade from PostGIS version 2.5.4 (or lower) to 3.1.2, you must perform the following  actions:
     -  Since the return type of the raster functions have changed, you must drop and re-create the raster extension as part of the upgrade process. 
     - Before upgrading to version 3.1.2,  you must upgrade to 3.1.1 first as an intermediate step.
     - When the PostGIS data has a dependency on the raster functions, upgrading to PostGIS 3.1.2 requires dumping and reloading the data.

    See the [upgrade section](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgis/latest/03_upgrading_postgis/) for details.
