EDB PostGIS is a PostgreSQL extension that allows you to store Geographic Information Systems (GIS) objects in an Advanced Server database. It includes functions for analyzing and processing GIS objects and support for GiST-based R-Tree spatial indexes.

The complete documentation for PostGIS is added to your system during the installation and is available online at the [PostGIS project site](https://postgis.net/documentation/).
