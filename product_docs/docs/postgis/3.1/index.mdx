EDB PostGIS is a PostgreSQL extension that allows you to store geographic information systems (GIS) objects in an EDB Postgres Advanced Server database. It includes functions for analyzing and processing GIS objects and support for GiST-based R-Tree spatial indexes.

The complete documentation for PostGIS is added to your system during the installation and is available online at the [PostGIS project site](https://postgis.net/documentation/).
