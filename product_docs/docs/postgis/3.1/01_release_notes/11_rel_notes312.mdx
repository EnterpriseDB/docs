!!! Note
    To upgrade from PostGIS version 2.5.4 (or lower) to 3.1.2, you must perform the following  actions:
     -  Since the return type of the raster functions have changed, you must drop and re-create the raster extension as part of the upgrade process. 
     - Before upgrading to version 3.1.2,  you must upgrade to 3.1.1 first as an intermediate step.
     - When the PostGIS data has a dependency on the raster functions, upgrading to PostGIS 3.1.2 requires dumping and reloading the data.

    See the [upgrade section](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgis/latest/03_upgrading_postgis/) for details.
