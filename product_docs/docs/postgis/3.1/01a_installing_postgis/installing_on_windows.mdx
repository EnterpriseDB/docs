You must install Advanced Server before installing PostGIS. If you have used the graphical Setup wizard to install EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you can use StackBuilder Plus to add PostGIS to your installation. For details about using the graphical installer to install and configure Advanced Server, see the EDB Postgres Advanced Server Installation Guide for Windows.

!!! Note

    To install PostGIS version 3.1 on EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 10 on Windows, you need to upgrade it to the latest EDB Postgres Advanced Server minor version of 10.16.25 (or later), and then proceed with PostGIS 3.1 installation. 
    
1.  Open StackBuilder Plus and select your Advanced Server installation from the drop-down list on the `Welcome` window. Click `Next` to continue to the application selection page.
