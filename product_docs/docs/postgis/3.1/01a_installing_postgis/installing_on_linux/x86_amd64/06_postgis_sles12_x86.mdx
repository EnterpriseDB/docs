Perform the following steps to install PostGIS on an SLES Host using the Zypper package manager:

Zypper will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package but requires access to specific repositories not hosted at EDB.

1.  Assume superuser privileges.

    ```text
    sudo su -
    ```

2.  Use the following command to add the EDB repository to your SLES host:

    ```text
    zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo
    ```

3.  Invoke the following command to refresh the metadata:

    ```text
    zypper refresh
    ```

4.  Install `SUSEConnect` to register the host with SUSE to allow access to SUSE repositories:

    ```text
    zypper install SUSEConnect
    ```

5.  Register the host with SUSE to allow access to SUSE repositories and replace `'REGISTRATION_CODE'` and `'EMAIL'` with your SUSE registration information:

    ```text
    SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'
    SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.4/x86_64
    SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.4/x86_64
    ```
    
7.  Refresh the metadata:

    ```text
    zypper refresh
    ```

9.  Use the zypper utility to install PostGIS:

    ```text
    zypper -n install edb-as14f-postgis
    ```
