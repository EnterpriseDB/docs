Before creating the repository configuration file, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user).

Perform the following steps:

1.  To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges, and invoke the platform-specific command:

    On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

    On Rocky Linux 8 or AlmaLinux 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

2.  Replace the `USERNAME:PASSWORD` variable in the following command with the username and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user:

    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

3.  Before installing PostGIS, you need to install the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) release package:

    On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

    On Rocky Linux 8 or AlmaLinux 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install epel-release
    ```

4.  The following  steps are applicable only for Rocky Linux 8 or AlmaLinux 8 platform:

    a. Enable the PowerTools repository to satisfy package dependencies:

    ```text
    dnf config-manager --set-enabled PowerTools
    ```

    b. Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:

    ```text
    dnf -qy module disable postgresql
    ```

5.  Invoke the platform-specific command to install `PostGIS`:

    On CentOS 7, to install the latest version of PostGIS version for EDB Advanced Server version 13.0:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as13-postgis3
    ```

    On Rocky Linux 8 or AlmaLinux 8, to install the latest version of PostGIS version for EDB Advanced Server version 13.0:

    ```text
    dnf -y install edb-as13-postgis3
    ```

    On CentOS 7, to install the latest version of PostGIS for EDB Advanced Server versions older than 13.0:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as<xx>-postgis
    ```

    where &lt;xx> denotes the Advanced Server version older than 13.0.

    On CentOS 7, to install PostGIS older versions (for example PostGIS 3.0.2) for EDB Advanced Server version 13.0:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as13-postgis3-3.0.2
    ```

    On CentOS 7, to install older PostGIS versions for EDB Advanced Server versions older than 13.0:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as<xx>-postgis-<y.y.y>
    ```

    where &lt;xx> is the Advanced Server version older than 13.0 and &lt;y.y.y> is the older PostGIS version.
    
    For example, to install PostGIS 2.5.4 on Advanced Server 12:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as12-postgis-2.5.4
    ```

    When you install an RPM package signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y` and press `Return` to continue.

    !!! Note
        After installing PostGIS with a package manager, you must manually create a template database and the required PostGIS extension.
