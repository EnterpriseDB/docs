## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on the same host. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux).

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

## Install the package

```shell
# To install PostGIS 3.2 using EDB Postgres Advanced Server 13-14:
sudo apt-get -y install edb-as<xx>-postgis32

# To install PostGIS 3.2 using EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11-12:
sudo sudo apt-get -y install edb-as<xx>-postgis-3.2
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server. Replace `<xx>` with the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server you are using. For example, `edb-as14-postgis32`.
