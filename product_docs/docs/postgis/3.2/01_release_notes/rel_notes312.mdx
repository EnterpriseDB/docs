!!! Note
    To upgrade from PostGIS version 2.5.4 (or lower) to 3.1.2, you must perform the following actions:
     -  Since the return type of the raster functions have changed, you must drop and re-create the raster extension as part of the upgrade process. 
     - Before upgrading to version 3.1.2, you must upgrade to 3.1.1 first as an intermediate step.
     - When the PostGIS data has a dependency on the raster functions, upgrading to PostGIS 3.1.2 requires dumping and reloading the data.

    See the [upgrade section](../installing/upgrading/) for details.
