## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install Postgres on the same host. See:

  - [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/installing/)

  - [Installing PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Install the EPEL repository

  ```shell
  sudo dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
  ```

- Enable additional repositories to resolve dependencies:
  ```shell
  ARCH=$( /bin/arch ) subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"
  ```
  !!!note
  If you are using a public cloud RHEL image, `subscription manager` may not be enabled and enabling it may incur unnecessary charges. Equivalent packages may be available under a different name such as `codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-rhui-rpms`. Consult the documentation for the RHEL image you are using to determine how to install `codeready-builder`.

## Install the package

```shell
# To install PostGIS 3.2:
sudo dnf -y install edb-as<xx>-postgis32

# To install PostGIS 3.1 using EDB Postgres Advanced Server 13-15:
sudo dnf -y install edb-as<xx>-postgis3

# To install PostGIS 3.1 using EDB Postgres Advanced Server 11-12:
sudo dnf -y install edb-as<xx>-postgis
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server. Replace `<xx>` with the version of EDB Postgres Advanced Server you are using. For example, `edb-as15-postgis32`.
