title: "Migrating data"

## Migration creation and status

Source and target database schema are used to specify data to migrate along with
configurability for performance or, for example, for excluding source data.

EDB's cloud EDB Transporter components coordinate with customer-side CDCReader and CDCWriter to
execute change data capture (CDC) event streaming from source to target database. An initial
snapshot occurs followed by a transition to the streaming phase of CDC event production.

## Managing ongoing migrations

EDB can work with you and manage in-progress migrations to:
 - Exclude problematic source data
 - Pause and resume migrations
 - Optimize migration performance

You can configure and manage several independent migrations using the same CDCReader, CDCWriter,
and EDB-managed cloud EDB Transporter components.

## Migration completion and removal

To complete the migration, stop source database traffic and allow streaming migration
to transfer all CDC events. You can then stop EDB Transporter CDCReader and CDCWriter.
Target database integrity can be validated and application cutover to the target performed.

After confirming migration success, EDB decommissions all EDB Transporter cloud assets.
