The EDB Transporter migration lifecycle is as follows:
 - Ensure schema compatibility
 - Prepare source and target databases
 - Install and run customer-side EDB Transporter software
 - Share tables-to-migrate information with EDB staff (schema, table, and column name mapping between source and target)
 - EDB staff deploys cloud infrastructure (control components and a message bus)
 - EDB staff initiate and manage the data migration until completion
 - Integrity validation and post-migration checks are performed
 - Customer-side software can be stopped and removed
 - Cloud infrastructure is deprovisioned by EDB staff

Schema Compatibility
---

Oracle database sources must be assessed for schema compatibility using [EDB's Migration Portal](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_portal/latest/)
prior to starting the data migration process. Incompatible schemas will need to be addressed or excluded from the migration.
A limited number of Oracle data types and features are not supported by EDB Transporter.

Please see the [Debezium documentation](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/2.2/connectors/oracle.html#oracle-data-type-mappings) for detailed
comments on supported data types. Unsupported data types are briefly detailed below.

Unsupported Oracle Data Type
---
 - BFILE
 - LONG
 - LONG RAW
 - RAW
 - UROWID
 - User-defined types (REF, Varrays, Nested Tables)
 - ANY
 - XML
 - Spatial

EDB Transporter should not be used for replicating Oracle tables that contain blob, clob, or nclob columns and are expected to get UPDATE changes. Streaming UPDATE changes are currently not handled correctly.

Additionally, `BINARY_FLOAT` and `BINARY_DOUBLE` types in Oracle may contain `Nan`, `+INF`, and `-INF` values. These values are not supported by EDB Transporter.


Source and Target DB Preparation
---
See our guides on preparing [Oracle sources](preparing_oracle_source_databases/#preparing_oracle_sources),
[Postgres sources](preparing_postgres_source_databases/#preparing_postgres_sources), and [target databases](preparing_target_databases/#preparing_target_databases).

Installing and Configuring EDB Transporter Software
---
See our guide on [installing and configuring](installing_customer_side_software/#installing_customer_side_software) EDB Transporter software.
EDB staff manage cloud assets required for the migration such as Apache Kafka and other services offered by Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).

Migrating Data
---
Migration Creation and Status
----
Source and target database schema are used to specify data to migrate along with
configurabilty for performance or e.g. excluding source data.

Our cloud EDB Transporter components coordinate with customer-side CDCReader and CDCWriter to
execute Change-Data-Capture (CDC) event streaming from source to target database. An initial
snapshot occurs followed by a transition to the streaming phase of CDC event production.

Managing Ongoing Migrations
----
EDB can work with customers and manage in-progress migrations in order to:
 - Exclude problematic source data
 - Pause and resume migrations
 - Optimize migration performance

Several indepedent migrations can be configured and managed using the same CDCReader, CDCWriter,
and EDB-managed cloud EDB Transporter components.

Migration Completion and Removal
----
To complete the migration, source database traffic should be stopped and streaming migration
allowed to transfer all CDC events. EDB Transporter CDCReader and CDCWriter can then be stopped.
Target database integrity can be validated and application cutover to the target performed.

After confirming migration success EDB staff will decommission all EDB Transporter cloud assets.
