EDB Transporter is a cloud-first migration solution based on Debezium and Kafka. Change event data streaming enables secure, fault tolerant, and performant migrations to BigAnimal, on-premise EPAS/Postgres, or other cloud-hosted databases.

EDB BigAnimal targets are supported with optional VPC peering for reduced migration cost and improved performance.

See our [usage overview](usage_overview/#usage_overview) for more information.
