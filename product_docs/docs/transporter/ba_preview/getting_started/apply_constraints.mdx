title: "Applying constraints"
---

Before starting the migration with EDB Data Migration Service, you [prepared and imported the schema](prepare_schema). Now, re-apply the constraints that were not included in the schema and data migration.

## `PRIMARY KEY` and `UNIQUE` constraints

For `PRIMARY KEY` and `UNIQUE` constraints, you have already created the tables and constraints in the target Postgres database. This allowed EDB Data Migration Service to map them to the source objects and migrate data sucessfuly. You don't need do to anything else. 

The same applies to `NOT NULL` constraints if you included them in your schema import.

## `FOREIGN KEY`, `REFERENCES`, `CHECK`, `CASCADE` and `EXCLUDE` constraints

You can now re-apply the `FOREIGN KEY`, `REFERENCES`, `CHECK`, `CASCADE` and `EXCLUDE` constraints you excluded during the [schema preparation and import](prepare_schema).

## Ensuring data integrity

Rows in tables that do not have `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE` constraints were migrated with at-least-once delivery, therefore, it is possible that these rows are duplicate. 

Deduplication can be performed during integrity validation. For exmaple, you can use [EDB LiveCompare](/livecompare/latest/).
