## PG AI Migrations Powered By EDB Transporter

EDB Transporter offers a secure and fault-tolerant way to migrate database data to the PG AI platform. Using change data capture (CDC) and event streaming, source database row changes are replicated to the migration destination. Users are able to select a subset of their schemas' tables to migrate including support for schema, table, and column name remapping.

EDB Transporter is built on Apache Kafka and the open-source Debezium CDC platform.

Self-managed database sources required download and configuration of the EDB Transporter Reader.
