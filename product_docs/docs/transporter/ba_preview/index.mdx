## PG AI Migrations Powered by EDB Data Migration Service

EDB Data Migration Service offers a secure and fault-tolerant way to migrate database data to the PG AI platform. Using change data capture (CDC) and event streaming, source database row changes are replicated to the migration destination. You can select a subset of your schemas' tables to migrate including support for schema, table, and column name remapping.

EDB Data Migration Service is built on Apache Kafka and the open-source Debezium CDC platform.

To migrate self-managed database sources you must download and configure the EDB Data Migration Reader.
