description: Revise any unsupported Oracle data types and features.  
---

A limited number of Oracle data types and features aren't supported by EDB Data Migration Service.

See the [Debezium documentation](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/2.2/connectors/oracle.html#oracle-data-type-mappings) for detailed comments on supported data types. 

Unsupported Oracle data types include:

- BFILE
- LONG
- LONG RAW
- RAW
- UROWID
- User-defined types (REF, Varrays, Nested Tables)
- ANY
- XML
- Spatial

EDB Data Migration Service supports replicating Oracle tables that contain BLOB, CLOB, or NCLOB columns only if these also have the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint. If the tables don't have the `PRIMARY KEY` constraint, the streaming replication will only support INSERT operations.

`BINARY_FLOAT` and `BINARY_DOUBLE` types in Oracle that might contain `Nan`, `+INF`, and `-INF` values are not supported by EDB Data Migration Service.
