title: "Migrating Data"
---
### Migration Creation and Status
Source and target database schema are used to specify data to migrate along with
configurability for performance or e.g. excluding source data.

Our cloud EDB Transporter components coordinate with customer-side CDCReader and CDCWriter to
execute Change-Data-Capture (CDC) event streaming from source to target database. An initial
snapshot occurs followed by a transition to the streaming phase of CDC event production.

### Managing Ongoing Migrations
EDB can work with customers and manage in-progress migrations in order to:
 - Exclude problematic source data
 - Pause and resume migrations
 - Optimize migration performance

Several independent migrations can be configured and managed using the same CDCReader, CDCWriter,
and EDB-managed cloud EDB Transporter components.

### Migration Completion and Removal
To complete the migration, source database traffic should be stopped and streaming migration
allowed to transfer all CDC events. EDB Transporter CDCReader and CDCWriter can then be stopped.
Target database integrity can be validated and application cutover to the target performed.

After confirming migration success EDB staff will decommission all EDB Transporter cloud assets.
