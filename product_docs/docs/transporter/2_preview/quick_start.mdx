The EDB Transporter migration lifecycle is as follows:
 - Ensure schema compatibility
 - Prepare source and target databases
 - Install and run customer-side EDB Transporter software
 - Share tables-to-migrate information with EDB staff (schema, table, and column name mapping between source and target)
 - EDB staff deploys cloud infrastructure (control components and a message bus)
 - EDB staff initiate and manage the data migration until completion
 - Integrity validation and post-migration checks are performed
 - Customer-side software can be stopped and removed
 - Cloud infrastructure is deprovisioned by EDB staff


### Schema Compatibility

Oracle database sources must be assessed for schema compatibility using [EDB's Migration Portal](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_portal/latest/)
prior to starting the data migration process. Incompatible schemas will need to be addressed or excluded from the migration.

### Source and Target DB Preparation
See our guides on preparing [Oracle sources](preparing_db/preparing_oracle_source_databases/#preparing_oracle_sources),
[Postgres sources](preparing_db/preparing_postgres_source_databases/#preparing_postgres_sources), and [target databases](preparing_db/preparing_target_databases/#preparing_target_databases).

### Installing and Configuring EDB Transporter Software
See our guide on [installing and configuring](installing) EDB Transporter software.
EDB staff manage cloud assets required for the migration such as Apache Kafka and other services offered by Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).
