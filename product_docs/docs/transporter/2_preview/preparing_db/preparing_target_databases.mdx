Migration data is written to the target database over a normal JDBC connection. A database user with permissions to write to target tables must be available.

The target database schema must exist before you start the data migration.

EDB Transporter provides a fault-tolerant method for migrating change data capture (CDC) events to the target. If a CDC event doesn't match the target schema, CDCWriter stops writing data to the target until you resolve the schema mismatch.

Target tables must be empty. If a target table has rows, such as from testing, remove them, for example, with `TRUNCATE`.
