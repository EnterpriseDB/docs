Migration data is written to the target database over a normal JDBC connection. It's expected that a database user is available with permissions to write to target tables.

The target database schema must exist prior to starting the data migration.
EDB Transporter provides a fault-tolerant method for migrating Change-Data-Capture (CDC) events to the target. If a CDC event doesn't match the target schema CDCWriter will stop writing data to the target until the schema mismatched is resolved.

Target tables should be empty. If a target table has rows, such as from testing, these should be removed e.g. with `TRUNCATE`.
