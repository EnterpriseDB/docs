EDB Transporter offers you an effective way to migrate database data from one database to another. It does this by using the technique known as change data capture. This process catches changes in a source database’s rows being made by applications and streams them to a destination database, reshaping the data to the schema of the destination database in the process.

By streaming the changes from one database to another, the process avoids the traditional “big bang” of exporting, converting, and importing that came with traditional migration.

EDB Transporter is built on Kafka, a data-streaming technology, and Debezium, which uses that technology to move captured data between databases.

When the source or destination database is on premises or in a private cloud, then you need to install EDB Transporter’s CDCReader or CDCWriter. You and EDB’s team can then plan and start your migration.
