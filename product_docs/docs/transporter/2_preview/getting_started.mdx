Setting up an EDB Transporter migration consists of a number of steps.

### Planning
 - Ensure schema compatibility

Oracle database sources must be assessed for schema compatibility using [EDB's Migration Portal](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_portal/latest/)
prior to starting the data migration process. Incompatible schemas will need to be addressed or excluded from the migration.

### Preparing
 - Prepare source and target databases

Each source and the target databases need to be prepared for the migration. This involves enable archive log mode and supplemental logging on the Oracle Database and create a User.

See our guides on preparing [Oracle sources](preparing_db/preparing_oracle_source_databases/#preparing_oracle_sources),
[Postgres sources](preparing_db/preparing_postgres_source_databases/#preparing_postgres_sources), and [target databases](preparing_db/preparing_target_databases/#preparing_target_databases).

### Installing
 - Install and run customer-side EDB Transporter software

See our guide on [installing and configuring](installing) EDB Transporter software.
EDB staff manage cloud assets required for the migration such as Apache Kafka and other services offered by Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).

### Sharing Migration Information
 - Share tables-to-migrate information with EDB staff (schema, table, and column name mapping between source and target)

To be able to create the migration, EDB staff needs to know the schemas and tables that are needed to migrate to the target database.
If the table/column names will be different from the source, EDB staff also needs the mapping for each table/column to their new names.

Next steps are carried out by EDB Staff:

### Deploying Infrastructure
 - EDB staff deploys cloud infrastructure (control components and a message bus)

### Beginning Migration
 - EDB staff initiate and manage the data migration until completion

### Validating Migration
 - Integrity validation and post-migration checks are performed

### Post-Migration Steps
Your migration is now up and running and will last as long as required. Once your data is across, and if you plan to stop the migration once that is done
 - Customer-side software can be stopped and removed
 - Cloud infrastructure is deprovisioned by EDB staff
