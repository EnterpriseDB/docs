Setting up an EDB Transporter migration consists of a number of steps.

## Planning: Ensure schema compatibility

Assess Oracle database sources for schema compatibility using the [EDB Migration Portal](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/migration_portal/latest/) before starting the data migration process. Address incompatible schemas or exclude them from the migration.

## Preparing source and target databases

You need to prepare each source and the target databases needed for the migration. To prepare, enable archive log mode and supplemental logging on the Oracle database and create a user. For details, see:

-  [Preparing Oracle source databases](preparing_db/preparing_oracle_source_databases/#preparing_oracle_sources)
-  [Preparing Postgres source databases](preparing_db/preparing_postgres_source_databases/#preparing_postgres_sources)
-  [Preparing target databases](preparing_db/preparing_target_databases/#preparing_target_databases)

## Installing

Install and run customer-side EDB Transporter software. For details, see [Installing EDB Transporter software](installing).

EDB manages cloud assets required for the migration, such as Apache Kafka and other services offered by cloud service providers.

## Sharing migration information

Share tables-to-migrate information with EDB (schema, table, and column-name mapping between source and target).

To be able to create the migration, EDB needs to know the schemas and tables needed to migrate to the target database.

If the target table and column names are different from the source, EDB also needs the mapping for each table and column to its new name.

## EDB migration responsibilities

EDB performs the next steps: 

- Deploying infrastructure. EDB deploys cloud infrastructure, which includes control components and a message bus.

- Starting migration. EDB initiates and manages the data migration until complete.

- Validating migration. EDB performs integrity validation and post-migration checks.

## Post-migration steps

After these steps, your migration is up and running and will last as long as required. After your data is across,if you plan to then stop the migration:

 - You can stop and remove customer-side software.
 - EDB deprovisions cloud infrastructure.
