A limited number of Oracle data types and features aren't supported by EDB Transporter.

See the [Debezium documentation](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/2.2/connectors/oracle.html#oracle-data-type-mappings) for detailed comments on supported data types. 

Unsupported Oracle data types include:

- BFILE
- LONG
- LONG RAW
- RAW
- UROWID
- User-defined types (REF, Varrays, Nested Tables)
- ANY
- XML
- Spatial

Don't use EDB Transporter for replicating Oracle tables that contain blob, clob, or nclob columns and are expected to get UPDATE changes. Streaming UPDATE changes currently aren't handled correctly.

Also, `BINARY_FLOAT` and `BINARY_DOUBLE` types in Oracle might contain `Nan`, `+INF`, and `-INF` values. EDB Transporter doesn't support these values.
