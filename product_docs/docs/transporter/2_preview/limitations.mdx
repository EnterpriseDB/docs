Please see the [Debezium documentation](https://debezium.io/documentation/reference/2.2/connectors/oracle.html#oracle-data-type-mappings) for detailed
comments on supported data types. Unsupported data types are briefly detailed below.

 - User-defined types (REF, Varrays, Nested Tables)
 - ANY

EDB Transporter should not be used for replicating Oracle tables that contain blob, clob, or nclob columns and are expected to get UPDATE changes. Streaming UPDATE changes are currently not handled correctly.

Additionally, `BINARY_FLOAT` and `BINARY_DOUBLE` types in Oracle may contain `Nan`, `+INF`, and `-INF` values. These values are not supported by EDB Transporter.
