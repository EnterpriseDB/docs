title: "Upgrading"
---

Upgrades to CDCReader and CDCWriter are straightforward but involve a temporary halt to any data migration.
These components are designed to terminate and restart gracefully. 

To upgrade the software:

1. Stop the software you're upgrading (CDCReader or CDCWriter).

1. Install and start a new version of that software. 

Data migration resumes.

<!--Verify this last step doesn't require any action.-->

Incompatible upgrades are documented in the [release notes](rel_notes) and can be identified
by major version number increases.
