title: "Upgrading"
---

Upgrades to CDCReader and CDCWriter are straightforward but involve a temporary halt in any data migration.
These components are designed to crash and restart gracefully. To upgrade the software, CDCReader and/or CDCWriter
are stopped. A new version of CDCReader and CDCWriter are installed and started, and data migration resumes.

Incompatible upgrades are documented in the [release notes](../rel_notes) and can be identified
by major version number increases.
