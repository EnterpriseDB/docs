HARP Manager is a daemon that interacts with the local PostgreSQL/BDR node
and stores information about its state in the consensus layer. Manager
determines the node that currently holds leader status for a respective location
and enforces configuration (lag, CAMO lag, etc.) constraints to prevent
ineligible nodes from leader consideration.

Every Postgres node in the cluster must have an associated HARP Manager. 
Other nodes can exist, but they can't to participate as lead or 
shadow master roles or any other functionality that requires a HARP Manager.

!!! Important
    HARP Manager expects the be used to start and stop the database.  Stopping HARP Manager
    will stop the database.  Starting HARP Manager will start the database if it 
    isn't already started.  If another method is used to stop the database then 
    HARP Manager will try and restart it.

## How it works

Upon starting, HARP Manager uses `pg_ctl` to start Postgres if it isn't
already running. After this, it periodically checks the server as defined
by the `node.lease_refresh_interval` setting. HARP Manager collects various
bits of data about Postgres including:

* The node's current LSN.
* If Postgres is running and accepting connections. This particular data point
  is considered a lease that must be periodically renewed. If it expires, HARP
  Proxy removes the node from any existing routing.
* The current apply LSN position for all upstream BDR peer nodes.
* If CAMO is enabled:
    - Name of the CAMO partner
    - Peer CAMO state (`is_ready`)
    - CAMO queue received and applied LSN positions
* Node type, such as whether the node is BDR or regular Postgres.
* The node's current role, such as a read/write, physical streaming replica, 
  logical standby, and so on.
* BDR node state, which is `ACTIVE` except in limited cases.
* BDR Node ID for other metadata gathering.
* Other tracking values.

!!! Important 
    When naming BDR nodes in HARP, the BDR node name must match the node
    name represented in the `node.name` configuration attribute. This occurs in the bootstrap process.

The data collected here is fully available to other HARP Manager processes and
is used to evaluate lag, partner readiness, and other criteria that direct
switchover and failover behavior.

After updating the node metadata, HARP Manager either refreshes the lead 
master lease if it's already held by the local node or seeks to obtain the 
lease if it's expired. Since the current state of all nodes is known to all
other nodes, the node that was the previous lead master is given automatic
priority ranking if present. If not, all other nodes list themselves by
LSN lag, node priority, and other criteria, and the most qualified node seizes the lead master lease.

This procedure happens for every defined location where nodes are present. Thus 
for locations DC1 and DC2, there is a lead master node in each, with a 
separate lease and election process for both.

HARP Manager repeats these Postgres status checks, lease renewals, and 
elections repeatedly to ensure the cluster always has a lead master target for 
connections from HARP Proxy. 

## Configuration

HARP Manager expects the `dcs`, `cluster`, and `manager` configuration stanzas. 
The following is a functional example:

```yaml
cluster:
  name: mycluster

dcs:
  driver: etcd
  endpoints:
    - host1:2379
    - host2:2379
    - host3:2379

manager:
  name: node1
  postgres_bin_dir: /usr/lib/postgresql/13/bin
```

You can apply changes to the configuration file (default: `/etc/harp/config.yml`) by issuing `SIGHUP` to the running instance or by calling a
service-level reload.

See [Configuration](04_configuration) for further details.

## Usage

This is the basic usage for HARP Manager:

```bash
Usage of ./harp-manager:
  -f string
    	Optional path to config file (shorthand)
  --config string
    	Optional path to config file
```

There are no arguments to launch `harp-manager` as a forked daemon. 
This software is designed to be launched through systemd or in a container 
as a top-level process. This also means output is directed to STDOUT and STDERR
for capture and access through journald or an attached container terminal.

## Disabling and reenabling HARP Manager control of Postgres

You can temporarily pause HARP Manager control of Postgres. This 
results in a state where the daemon continues running but doesn't perform any 
operations that can affect existing behavior of the cluster. Reenabling 
management causes it to resume operation.

An example of temporarily disabling node management is:

```bash
harpctl unmanage node node1
```

See [harpctl command-line tool](08_harpctl) for more details.

Node management by HARP Manager is enabled by default.
