Beyond basic package installation and configuration, HARP requires
Postgres permissions to operate. These allow it to gather information about
Postgres or BDR as needed to maintain node status in the consensus
layer.

## Postgres permissions

Create the role specified in the `node.dsn` parameter in one
of the following ways:

* `CREATE USER ...`
* `CREATE ROLE ... WITH LOGIN`

This syntax ensures the role can log into the database to
gather diagnostic information.

Similarly, an entry must exist in `pg_hba.conf` for this role. You can do this in
many ways. As an example, consider a VPN subnet where all database hosts are
located somewhere in `10.10.*`. In such a case, the easiest approach is to add
a specific line:

```
# TYPE     DATABASE    USER         ADDRESS         METHOD
hostssl    all         harp_user    10.10.1.1/16    scram-sha-256
```

!!! Note
    In this case we've used the more modern `scram-sha-256` authentication
    rather than `md5`, which is now deprecated. We've also elected to require
    SSL authentication by specifying `hostssl`.

## BDR permissions

BDR nodes have metadata and views that are visible only when certain roles are
granted to the HARP-enabled user. In this case, the HARP user requires the
following:

```sql
GRANT bdr_monitor TO harp_user;
```

The `bdr_monitor` BDR role is meant for status monitoring tools to maintain
ongoing information on cluster operation, thus it is well-suited to HARP.

## BDR consensus permissions

When the `dcs.driver` configuration parameter is set to `bdr`, HARP 
uses BDR as the consensus layer. As such, it requires access to API 
methods that are currently available only to the `bdr_superuser` role. This 
means the HARP-enabled user requires the following:

```sql
GRANT bdr_superuser TO foobar;
```

Currently access to the BDR consensus model requires superuser equivalent
permission.

!!! Important
    BDR superusers *are not* Postgres superusers. The `bdr_superuser` role is
    merely granted elevated privileges in BDR, such as access to
    restricted functions, tables, views, and other objects.
