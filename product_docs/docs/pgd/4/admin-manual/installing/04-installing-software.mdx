## Installing the PGD software

With the repositories configured, you can now install the Postgres Distributed software. 
You must perform these steps on each host before proceeding to the next step.

* **Install the packages.**
  * Install the PGD packages, which include a server-specific BDR package and generic PGD CLI packages(`edb-bdr4-<postgresversion>` and `edb-pgd-cli`).


* **Ensure the Postgres database server was initialized and started.**
  * Use `systemctl status` to check the service is running.
  * If it isn't, initialize the database and start the service.


* **Configure the BDR extension.**
  * Add the BDR extension (`$libdir/bdr`) at the start of the `shared_preload_libraries` setting in `postgresql.conf`.
  * Set the `wal_level` GUC variable to `logical` in `postgresql.conf`.
  * Turn on commit timestamp tracking by setting `track_commit_timestamp` to `'on'` in `postgresql.conf`.
  * Raise the maximum worker processes to 16 or higher by setting `max_worker_processes` to `'16'` in `postgresql.conf`.<br/><br/>
  !!! Note The `max_worker_processes` value
  The `max_worker_processes` value is derived from the topology of the cluster, the number of peers, number of databases, and other factors. 
  To calculate the needed value, see [Postgres configuration/settings](/pgd/4/bdr/configuration/#postgresql-settings-for-bdr).
  The value of 16 was calculated for the size of cluster being deployed in this example and must be raised for larger clusters.
  !!!
  * Set a password on the EnterprisedDB/Postgres user.
  * Add rules to `pg_hba.conf` to allow nodes to connect to each other.
    * Ensure that these lines are present in `pg_hba.conf`:
    ```
    host all all all md5
    host replication all all md5
    ```
  * Add a `.pgpass` file to allow nodes to authenticate each other.
    * Configure a user with sufficient privileges to be able to log into the other nodes.
    * See [The Password File](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html) in the Postgres documentation for more on the `.pgpass` file. 


* **Restart the server.**
  * Verify the restarted server is running with the modified settings and that the BDR extension is available.


* **Create the replicated database.**
  * Log in to the server's default database (`edb` for EDB Postgres Advanced Server, `postgres` for EDB Postgres Extended Server and community Postgres).
  * Use `CREATE DATABASE bdrdb` to create the default PGD replicated database.
  * Log out and then log back in to `bdrdb`.
  * Use `CREATE EXTENSION bdr` to enable the BDR extension and PGD to run on that database.


The worked example that follows explores these steps in detail for EDB Postgres Advanced Server. 

If you're installing PGD with EDB Postgres Extended Server or community Postgres, the steps are similar, but details such as package names and paths are different. These differences are summarized in [Installing PGD for EDB Postgres Extended Server](#installing-pgd-for-edb-postgres-extended-server) and [Installing PGD for Postgresql](#installing-pgd-for-postgresql).

## Worked example

### Install the packages

The first step is to install the packages. For each Postgres package, there's an `edb-bdr4-<postgresversion>` package to go with it. 
For example, if you're installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server (epas) version 14, you install `edb-bdr4-epas14`. 

There are two other packages to also install: 

- `edb-pgd-cli` for the PGD command line tool

To install all of these packages on a RHEL or RHEL-compatible Linux, run:

```
sudo dnf -y install edb-bdr4-epas14 edb-pgd-cli
```

### Ensure the database is initialized and started

If it wasn't initialized and started by the database's package initialization (or you're repeating the process), you need to initialize and start the server.

To see if the server is running, you can check the service. The service name for EDB Advanced Server is `edb-as-14`, so run:

```
sudo systemctl status edb-as-14
```

If the server isn't running, the response is:

```
○ edb-as-14.service - EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14
     Loaded: loaded (/usr/lib/systemd/system/edb-as-16.service; disabled; preset: disabled)
     Active: inactive (dead)
```

The "Active: inactive (dead)" tells you that you need to initialize and start the server.

You need to know the path to the setup script for your particular Postgres flavor.

For EDB Postgres Advanced Server, this script can be found in `/usr/edb/as14/bin` as `edb-as-14-setup`. 
This command needs to be run with the `initdb` parameter, passing an option setting the database to use UTF-8:

```
sudo PGSETUP_INITDB_OPTIONS="-E UTF-8" /usr/edb/as14/bin/edb-as-14-setup initdb
```

Once the database is initialized, start it, which enables you to continue configuring the BDR extension"

```
sudo systemctl start edb-as-14
```

### Configure the BDR extension

Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server creates a system user enterprisedb with admin capabilities when connected to the database. In this example, this user configures the BDR extension.

#### Preload the BDR library

The BDR library needs to be preloaded with other libraries. 
EDB Postgres Advanced Server has a number of libraries already preloaded, so you have to prefix the existing list with the BDR library:

```
echo -e "shared_preload_libraries = '\$libdir/bdr,\$libdir/dbms_pipe,\$libdir/edb_gen,\$libdir/dbms_aq'" | sudo -u enterprisedb tee -a /var/lib/edb/as14/data/postgresql.conf >/dev/null
```

!!!tip
This command format (`echo ... | sudo ... tee -a ...`) appends the echoed string to the end of the `postgresql.conf` file, which is owned by another user.
!!!

#### Set the `wal_level`

The BDR extension needs to set the server to perform logical replication. You can do this by setting `wal_level` to `logical`:

```
echo -e "wal_level = 'logical'" | sudo -u enterprisedb tee -a /var/lib/edb/as14/data/postgresql.conf >/dev/null

```

#### Enable commit timestamp tracking

The BDR extension also needs the commit timestamp tracking enabled:

```
echo -e "track_commit_timestamp = 'on'" | sudo -u enterprisedb tee -a /var/lib/edb/as14/data/postgresql.conf >/dev/null

```

#### Raise `max_worker_processes`

To communicate between multiple nodes, Postgres Distributed nodes run more worker processes than usual.
The default limit (8) is too low even for a small cluster. 

The `max_worker_processes` value is derived from the topology of the cluster, the number of peers, number of databases, and other factors. 
To calculate the needed value, see [Postgres configuration/settings](../../postgres-configuration/#postgres-settings). 

This example, with a 3-node cluster, uses the value of 16.

Raise the maximum number of worker processes to 16 with this command:

```
echo -e "max_worker_processes = '16'" | sudo -u enterprisedb tee -a /var/lib/edb/as14/data/postgresql.conf >/dev/null

```


This value must be raised for larger clusters.

#### Add a password to the Postgres enterprisedb user

To allow connections between nodes, a password needs to be set on the Postgres enterprisedb user. 
This example uses the password `secret`.
Select a different password for your deployments.
You will need this password when you get to [Creating the PGD cluster](05-creating-cluster).

```
sudo -u enterprisedb psql edb -c "ALTER USER enterprisedb WITH PASSWORD 'secret'"

```

#### Enable inter-node authentication in pg_hba.conf

Out of the box, Postgres allows local authentication and connections with the database but not external network connections. 
To enable this, edit `pg_hba.conf` and add appropriate rules, including rules for the replication users.
To simplify the process, use this command:

```
echo -e "host all all all md5\nhost replication all all md5" | sudo tee -a /var/lib/edb/as14/data/pg_hba.conf

```

It appends the following to `pg_hba.conf`, which enables the nodes to replicate:

```
host all all all md5
host replication all all md5

```


#### Enable authentication between nodes

As part of the process of connecting nodes for replication, PGD logs into other nodes. 
It performs that login as the user that Postgres is running under.
For EDB Postgres Advanced Server, this is the enterprisedb user.
That user needs credentials to log into the other nodes.
This example supplies these credentials using the `.pgpass` file, which needs to reside in the user's home directory.
The home directory for enterprisedb is `/var/lib/edb`.

Run this command to create the file:

```
echo -e "*:*:*:enterprisedb:secret" | sudo -u enterprisedb tee /var/lib/edb/.pgpass; sudo chmod 0600 /var/lib/edb/.pgpass

```

You can read more about the `.pgpass` file in [The Password File](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

### Restart the server

After all these configuration changes, we recommend that you restart the server with:

```
sudo systemctl restart edb-as-14

```

#### Check the extension has been installed

At this point, it's worth checking the extension is actually available and the configuration was correctly loaded. You can query the `pg_available_extensions` table for the BDR extension like this:

```
sudo -u enterprisedb psql edb -c "select * from pg_available_extensions where name like 'bdr'"

```

This command returns an entry for the extension and its version:

```
 name | default_version | installed_version |                  comment
------+-----------------+-------------------+-------------------------------------------
 bdr  | 4.3.3           |                   | Bi-Directional Replication for PostgreSQL
(1 row)
 ```

You can also confirm the other server settings using this command:

```
sudo -u enterprisedb psql edb -c "show all" | grep -e wal_level -e track_commit_timestamp -e max_worker_processes

```

### Create the replicated database

The server is now prepared for PGD. 
Next, create a database named `bdrdb` and install the BDR extension when logged into it.

```
sudo -u enterprisedb psql edb -c "CREATE DATABASE bdrdb"
sudo -u enterprisedb psql bdrdb -c "CREATE EXTENSION bdr"

```

Finally, test the connection by logging into the server.

```
sudo -u enterprisedb psql bdrdb
```

You're connected to the server. 

Execute the command `\dx` to list extensions installed.

```
bdrdb=# \dx
                                List of installed extensions
       Name       | Version |   Schema   |                   Description
------------------+---------+------------+--------------------------------------------------
 bdr              | 4.3.3   | pg_catalog | Bi-Directional Replication for PostgreSQL
 edb_dblink_libpq | 1.0     | pg_catalog | EnterpriseDB Foreign Data Wrapper for PostgreSQL
 edb_dblink_oci   | 1.0     | pg_catalog | EnterpriseDB Foreign Data Wrapper for Oracle
 edbspl           | 1.0     | pg_catalog | EDB-SPL procedural language
 plpgsql          | 1.0     | pg_catalog | PL/pgSQL procedural language
```

Notice that the BDR extension is listed in the table, showing that it's installed.

### Installing PGD for EDB Postgres Extended Server

If you're installing PGD with EDB Postgres Extended Server, there are a number of differences from the EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation:

* The BDR package to install is named `edb-bdrV-pgextendedNN`, where V is the PGD version and NN is the PGE version number.
* Call a different setup utility: `/usr/edb/pgeNN/bin/edb-pge-NN-setup` 
* The service name is `edb-pge-NN`.
* The system user is postgres, not enterprisedb.
* The home directory for the postgres user is `/var/lib/pgqsl`.
* `shared_preload_libraries` is empty by default and needs only `$libdir/bdr` added to it.
