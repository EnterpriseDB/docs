## Using PGD CLI


The PGD CLI client uses a configuration file to work out which hosts to connect to. 
There are [options](../../cli/using_cli) that allow you to override this to use alternative configuration files or explicitly point at a server, but by default PGD CLI looks for a configuration file in preset locations.

The connection to the database is authenticated in the same way as other command line utilities, like the psql command, are authenticated. 

Unlike other commands, PGD CLI doesn't interactively prompt for your password. Therefore, you must pass your password using one of the following methods:

 - Adding an entry to your [`.pgpass` password file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html), which includes the host, port, database name, user name, and password.
 - Setting the password in the `PGPASSWORD` environment variable.
 - Including the password in the connection string.

We recommend the first option, as the other options don't scale well with multiple database clusters, or they compromise password confidentiality.

### Configuring and connecting PGD CLI

* Ensure PGD-CLI is installed
   * If PGD CLI has already been installed move to the next step.
   * For any system, repeat the [configure repositories](03-configuring-repositories) step on that system.
   * Then run the package installation command appropriate for that platform.
      * RHEL and derivatives: `sudo dnf install edb-pgd-cli`
      * Debian, Ubuntu and derivatives: `sudo apt-get install edb-pgd-cli`
* Create a configuration file
  * YAML file which specifies the cluster and endpoints the PGD CLI application should use.
* Install the configuration file.
  * Copy the YAML configuraiton file to a default config directory /etc/edb/ as pgd-config.yml.
  * Repeat this on any system where you want to run PGD CLI.
* Add `/usr/local/bin/` to the PATH for any user wanting to use PGD CLI.
  * Add adding `/usr/local/bin` to the path in to your `.bashrc` file
* Run pgd-cli with the `pgd` command.

### Use PGD CLI to explore the cluster
* Check the health of the cluster with the `check-health` command.
* Show the nodes in the cluster with the `show-nodes` command.

We go into more details of these command in the worked example below.

Also consult the [PGD CLI documentation](../../cli/) for details of other configuration options and a full command reference.

## Worked example

### Ensure PGD CLI is installed

In this worked example, we will be configuring and using PGD CLI on host-one, where we've already installed Postgres and PGD.
There is no need to install PGD CLI again. We will be using the `enterprisedb` account as this is already configured for access to Postgres.
If you are not logged in as `enterprisedb` switch to it using:

```
sudo -iu enterprisedb
```

### Create a configuration file

The PGD CLI configuration file is similar to the PGD proxy configuration filer.
It is a YAML file which contains a cluster object. This has two properties:

The name of the PGD cluster's top-level group (as `name`).
An array of endpoints of databases (as `endpoints`).

```
cluster:
  name: pgd
  endpoints:
    - host=host-one dbname=bdrdb port=5444
    - host=host-two dbname=bdrdb port=5444
    - host=host-three dbname=bdrdb port=5444
```

Note that the endpoints in this example specify port=5444.
This is necessary for EDB Postgres Advanced Server instances.
For EDB Postgres Extended and Community PostgreSQL, this can be set to `port=5432`.

### Install the configuration file

Create the PGD CLI configuration directory.

```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/edb/
```

Then write the configuration to the `pgd-config.yml` file in the `/etc/edb/` directory.

For our example, this could be run on host-one to create the file.

```
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/edb/pgd-config.yml
cluster:
  name: pgd
  endpoints:
    - host=host-one dbname=bdrdb port=5444
    - host=host-two dbname=bdrdb port=5444
    - host=host-three dbname=bdrdb port=5444
EOF
```

This process can be repeated on any system where you need to use PGD CLI.

### Add `/usr/local/bin` to the Path

Run:

```
export PATH=/usr/local/bin:$PATH
```

To add the directory where the `pgd` command is installed to your path.

For users other than `enteprisedb` sdd this line to your `.bashrc` file to always have `pgd` available.

For the `enterprisedb` user, add the line to `/var/lib/ebd/.enterprisedb_profile`. 

### Run PGD CLI

With the configuration file in place, and logged is as the enterprisedb system user,  we can run pgd-cli. 
For example, we can use the `show-nodes` command to list the nodes in our cluster and their status.

```
pgd show-nodes
__OUTPUT__
Node       Node ID    Group Type Current State Target State Status Seq ID
----       -------    ----- ---- ------------- ------------ ------ ------
node-one   2824718320 dc1   data ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     1
node-three 1954860017 dc1   data ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     3
node-two   2299992455 dc1   data ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     2
```

### Using PGD CLI to explore the cluster

Once configured, you can use PGD CLI to get PGD level views of the cluster.

### Check the health of the cluster

The [`check-health`](../../cli/command_ref/pgd_check-health) command provides a quick way to view the health of the cluster:

```
pgd check-health
__OUTPUT__
Check      Status Message
-----      ------ -------
ClockSkew  Ok     All BDR node pairs have clockskew within permissible limit
Connection Ok     All BDR nodes are accessible
Raft       Ok     Raft Consensus is working correctly
Replslots  Ok     All BDR replication slots are working correctly
Version    Ok     All nodes are running same BDR versions
```

### Show the nodes in the cluster

As previously seen, the [`show-nodes`](../../cli/command_ref/pgd_show-nodes) command lists the nodes in the cluster:

```
pgd show-nodes
__OUTPUT__
Node       Node ID    Group Type Current State Target State Status Seq ID
----       -------    ----- ---- ------------- ------------ ------ ------
node-one   2824718320 dc1   data ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     1
node-three 1954860017 dc1   data ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     3
node-two   2299992455 dc1   data ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     2
```

Note that this view shows which group the node is a member of and its current status.
To find out what versions of PGD and Postgres are running on the nodes, use `show-version`:

```
pgd show-version
__OUTPUT__
----       ----------- ----------------
node-one   4.3.3       14.11.0
node-two   4.3.3       14.11.0
node-three 4.3.3       14.11.0
```
