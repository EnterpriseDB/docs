title: AutoPartition
---

AutoPartition allows tables to grow easily to large sizes by automatic
partitioning management. This capability uses features of BDR
such as low-conflict locking of creating and dropping partitions.

You can create new partitions regularly and then drop them when the
data retention period expires.

BDR management is primarily accomplished by functions that can be called by SQL.
All functions in BDR are exposed in the `bdr` schema. Unless you put it into
your search_path, you need to schema-qualify the name of each function.

## Auto creation of partitions

`bdr.autopartition()` creates or alters the definition of automatic
range partitioning for a table. If no definition exists, it's created.
Otherwise, later executions will alter the definition.

`bdr.autopartition()` doesn't lock the actual table. It changes the
definition of when and how new partition maintenance actions take place.

`bdr.autopartition()` leverages the features that allow a partition to be
attached or detached/dropped without locking the rest of the table
(when the underlying Postgres version supports it).

An ERROR is raised if the table isn't RANGE partitioned or a multi-column
partition key is used.

A new partition is added for every `partition_increment` range of values, with
lower and upper bound `partition_increment` apart. For tables with a partition
key of type `timestamp` or `date`, the `partition_increment` must be a valid
constant of type `interval`. For example, specifying `1 Day` causes a new
partition to be added each day, with partition bounds that are one day apart.

If the partition column is connected to a `snowflakeid`, `timeshard`, or `ksuuid` sequence,
you must specify the `partition_increment` as type `interval`. Otherwise,
if the partition key is integer or numeric, then the `partition_increment`
must be a valid constant of the same datatype. For example, specifying
`1000000` causes new partitions to be added every 1 million values.

If the table has no existing partition, then the specified
`partition_initial_lowerbound` is used as the lower bound for the first
partition. If you don't specify `partition_initial_lowerbound`, then the system
tries to derive its value from the partition column type and the specified
`partition_increment`. For example, if `partition_increment` is specified as `1 Day`, 
then `partition_initial_lowerbound` is set to CURRENT
DATE. If `partition_increment` is specified as `1 Hour`, then
`partition_initial_lowerbound` is set to the current hour of the current
date. The bounds for the subsequent partitions are set using the
`partition_increment` value.

The system always tries to have a certain minimum number of advance partitions.
To decide whether to create new partitions, it uses the
specified `partition_autocreate_expression`. This can be an expression that can be evaluated by SQL, 
which is evaluated every time a check is performed. For example,
for a partitioned table on column type `date`, if
`partition_autocreate_expression` is specified as `DATE_TRUNC('day',CURRENT_DATE)`, 
`partition_increment` is specified as `1 Day` and
`minimum_advance_partitions` is specified as 2, then new partitions are
created until the upper bound of the last partition is less than
`DATE_TRUNC('day', CURRENT_DATE) + '2 Days'::interval`.

The expression is evaluated each time the system checks for new partitions.

For a partitioned table on column type `integer`, you can specify the
`partition_autocreate_expression` as `SELECT max(partcol) FROM
schema.partitioned_table`. The system then regularly checks if the maximum value of
the partitioned column is within the distance of `minimum_advance_partitions * partition_increment` 
of the last partition's upper bound. Create an index on the `partcol` so that the query runs efficiently.
If the `partition_autocreate_expression` isn't specified for a partition table
on column type `integer`, `smallint`, or `bigint`, then the system
sets it to `max(partcol)`.

If the `data_retention_period` is set, partitions are
dropped after this period. Partitions are dropped at the same time as new
partitions are added, to minimize locking. If this value isn't set, you must drop the partitions manually.

The `data_retention_period` parameter is supported only for timestamp (and
related) based partitions. The period is calculated by considering the upper
bound of the partition. The partition is either migrated to the secondary
tablespace or dropped if either of the given period expires, relative to the
upper bound.

By default, AutoPartition manages partitions globally. In other words, when a
partition is created on one node, the same partition is also created on all
other nodes in the cluster. So all partitions are consistent and guaranteed to
be available. For this, AutoPartition makes use of Raft. You can change this behavior 
by passing `managed_locally` as `true`. In that case, all partitions
are managed locally on each node. This is useful for the case when the
partitioned table isn't a replicated table and hence it might not be necessary
or even desirable to have all partitions on all nodes. For example, the
built-in `bdr.conflict_history` table isn't a replicated table and is
managed by AutoPartition locally. Each node creates partitions for this table
locally and drops them once they are old enough.

You can't later change tables marked as `managed_locally` to be managed
globally and vice versa.

Activities are performed only when the entry is marked `enabled = on`.

You aren't expected to manually create or drop partitions for tables
managed by AutoPartition. Doing so can make the AutoPartition metadata
inconsistent and might cause it to fail.

### Configure AutoPartition

The `bdr.autopartition` function configures automatic partitioning of a table.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.autopartition(relation regclass,
		partition_increment text,
		partition_initial_lowerbound text DEFAULT NULL,
		partition_autocreate_expression text DEFAULT NULL,
		minimum_advance_partitions integer DEFAULT 2,
		maximum_advance_partitions integer DEFAULT 5,
		data_retention_period interval DEFAULT NULL,
		managed_locally boolean DEFAULT false,
		enabled boolean DEFAULT on);
```

#### Parameters

-   `relation` &mdash; Name or Oid of a table.
-   `partition_increment` &mdash; Interval or increment to next partition creation.
-   `partition_initial_lowerbound` &mdash; If the table has no partition, then the
    first partition with this lower bound and `partition_increment` apart upper
    bound is created.
-   `partition_autocreate_expression` &mdash; Used to detect if it's time to create new partitions.
-   `minimum_advance_partitions` &mdash; The system attempts to always have at
    least `minimum_advance_partitions` partitions.
-   `maximum_advance_partitions` &mdash; Number of partitions to be created in a single
    go once the number of advance partitions falls below `minimum_advance_partitions`.
-   `data_retention_period` &mdash; Interval until older partitions are dropped, if
    defined. This value must be greater than `migrate_after_period`.
-   `managed_locally` &mdash; If true, then the partitions are managed locally.
-   `enabled` &mdash; Allows activity to be disabled or paused and later resumed or reenabled.

#### Examples

Daily partitions, keep data for one month:

```sql
CREATE TABLE measurement (
logdate date not null,
peaktemp int,
unitsales int
) PARTITION BY RANGE (logdate);

bdr.autopartition('measurement', '1 day', data_retention_period := '30 days');
```

Create five advance partitions when there are only two more partitions remaining (each partition can hold 1 billion orders):

```sql
bdr.autopartition('Orders', '1000000000',
		partition_initial_lowerbound := '0',
		minimum_advance_partitions := 2,
		maximum_advance_partitions := 5
     );
```

### Create one AutoPartition

Use `bdr.autopartition_create_partition()` to create a standalone AutoPartition
on the parent table.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.autopartition_create_partition(relname regclass,
                          	   partname name,
                              	   lowerb text,
                                   upperb text,
                                   nodes oid[]);
```

#### Parameters

-   `relname` &mdash; Name or Oid of the parent table to attach to.
-   `partname` &mdash; Name of the new AutoPartition.
-   `lowerb` &mdash; The lower bound of the partition.
-   `upperb` &mdash; The upper bound of the partition.
-   `nodes` &mdash; List of nodes that the new partition resides on.

### Stopping automatic creation of partitions

Use `bdr.drop_autopartition()` to drop the auto-partitioning rule for the
given relation. All pending work items for the relation are deleted and no new
work items are created.

```sql
bdr.drop_autopartition(relation regclass);
```

#### Parameters

-   `relation` &mdash; Name or Oid of a table.

### Drop one AutoPartition

Use `bdr.autopartition_drop_partition` once a BDR AutoPartition table has been
made, as this function can specify single partitions to drop. If the partitioned
table was successfully dropped, the function returns `true`.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.autopartition_drop_partition(relname regclass)
```

#### Parameters

-   `relname` &mdash; The name of the partitioned table to drop.

### Notes

This places a DDL lock on the parent table, before using DROP TABLE on the
chosen partition table.

### Wait for partition creation

Use `bdr.autopartition_wait_for_partitions()` to wait for the creation of
partitions on the local node. The function takes the partitioned table name and
a partition key column value and waits until the partition that holds that
value is created.

The function only waits for the partitions to be created locally. It doesn't guarantee
that the partitions also exists on the remote nodes.

To wait for the partition to be created on all BDR nodes, use the
`bdr.autopartition_wait_for_partitions_on_all_nodes()` function. This function
internally checks local as well as all remote nodes and waits until the
partition is created everywhere.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.autopartition_wait_for_partitions(relation regclass, text bound);
```

#### Parameters

-   `relation` &mdash; Name or Oid of a table.
-   `bound` &mdash; Partition key column value.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.autopartition_wait_for_partitions_on_all_nodes(relation regclass, text bound);
```

#### Parameters

-   `relation` &mdash; Name or Oid of a table.
-   `bound` &mdash; Partition key column value.

### Find partition

Use the `bdr.autopartition_find_partition()` function to find the partition for the
given partition key value. If partition to hold that value doesn't exist, then
the function returns NULL. Otherwise Oid of the partition is returned.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.autopartition_find_partition(relname regclass, searchkey text);
```

#### Parameters

-   `relname` &mdash; Name of the partitioned table.
-   `searchkey` &mdash; Partition key value to search.

### Enable or disable AutoPartitioning

Use `bdr.autopartition_enable()` to enable AutoPartitioning on the given table.
If AutoPartitioning is already enabled, then no action occurs. Similarly, use
`bdr.autopartition_disable()` to disable AutoPartitioning on the given table.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.autopartition_enable(relname regclass);
```

#### Parameters

-   `relname` &mdash; Name of the relation to enable AutoPartitioning.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.autopartition_disable(relname regclass);
```

#### Parameters

-   `relname` &mdash; Name of the relation to disable AutoPartitioning.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.autopartition_get_last_completed_workitem();
```

Return the `id` of the last workitem successfully completed on all nodes in the
cluster.

### Check AutoPartition workers

From using the `bdr.autopartition_work_queue_check_status` function, you can
see the status of the background workers that are doing their job to maintain
AutoPartitions.

The workers can be seen through these views:
`autopartition_work_queue_local_status`
`autopartition_work_queue_global_status`

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.autopartition_work_queue_check_status(workid bigint
                           local boolean DEFAULT false);
```

#### Parameters

-   `workid` &mdash; The key of the AutoPartition worker.
-   `local` &mdash; Check the local status only.

#### Notes

AutoPartition workers are always running in the background, even before the
`bdr.autopartition` function is called for the first time. If an invalid worker ID
is used, the function returns `unknown`. `In-progress` is the typical status.
