## Overview

BDR is a PostgreSQL extension providing multi-master replication and data
distribution with advanced conflict management, data-loss protection, and
throughput up to 5X faster than native logical replication, and enables
distributed PostgreSQL clusters with high availability up to five 9s.

Detailed overview about how BDR works is described in the
[Architectural Overview](overview) chapter.

## Supported PostgreSQL database servers

BDR is compatible with Postgres, EDB Postgres Extended Server, and EDB Postgres
Advanced Server distributions and can be deployed as a
standard Postgres extension. See [Compatibility matrix](/pgd/latest/compatibility_matrix/)
for details of supported version combinations.

Some key BDR features depend on certain core
capabilities being available in the targeted Postgres database server.
Therefore, BDR users must also adopt the Postgres
database server distribution that's best suited to their business needs. For
example, if having the BDR feature Commit At Most Once (CAMO) is mission
critical to your use case, don't adopt the community
PostgreSQL distribution because it doesn't have the core capability required to handle
CAMO. See the full feature matrix compatibility in
[Choosing a Postgres distribution](/pgd/latest/choosing_server/).

BDR offers close to native Postgres compatibility. However, some access
patterns don't necessarily work as well in multi-node setup as they do on a
single instance. There are also some limitations in what can be safely
replicated in multi-node setting. [Application usage](appusage)
goes into detail on how BDR behaves from an application development perspective.
