---

With logical replication, transactions are decoded concurrently on the publisher
but aren't sent to subscribers until the transaction is committed. If the
changes exceed `logical_decoding_work_mem` (PostgreSQL 13 and later), they're
spilled to disk. This means that, particularly with large transactions, there's
some delay before they reach subscribers and might entail additional I/O
on the publisher.

Beginning with PostgreSQL 14, transactions can optionally be decoded and sent to
subscribers before they're committed on the publisher. The subscribers save
the incoming changes to a staging file (or set of files) and apply them when
the transaction commits (or discard them if the transaction aborts). This makes
it possible to apply transactions on subscribers as soon as the transaction
commits.

## BDR enhancements

PostgreSQL's built-in transaction streaming has the following
limitations:

-   While you no longer need to spill changes to disk on the publisher, you must write changes
    to disk on each subscriber.
-   If the transaction aborts, the work (changes received by each subscriber
    and the associated storage I/O) is wasted.

However, starting with version 3.7, BDR supports parallel apply, enabling multiple writer
processes on each subscriber. This capability is leveraged to provide the following enhancements:

-   Decoded transactions can be streamed directly to a writer on the subscriber.
-   Decoded transactions don't need to be stored on disk on subscribers.
-   You don't need to wait for the transaction to commit before starting to apply the
    transaction on the subscriber.

### Caveats

-   You must enable parallel apply.
-   Workloads consisting of many small and conflicting transactions can lead to
    frequent deadlocks between writers.

!!! Note
    Direct streaming to writer is still an experimental feature. Use it
    with caution. Specifically, it might not work well with
    conflict resolutions since the commit timestamp of the streaming might not
    be available. (The transaction might not yet have committed on the
    origin.)

## Configuration

Configure transaction streaming in two locations:

-   At node level, using the GUC [bdr.default_streaming_mode](configuration#transaction-streaming)
-   At group level, using the function [bdr.alter_node_group_config()](nodes#bdralter_node_group_config)

### Node configuration using bdr.default_streaming_mode

Permitted values are:

-   `off`
-   `writer`
-   `file`
-   `auto`

Default value is `auto`.

Changing this setting requires a restart of the
pglogical receiver process for each subscription for the setting to take effect. You can achieve this with a server
restart.

If `bdr.default_streaming_mode` is set any value other than `off`, the
subscriber requests transaction streaming from the publisher. How this is
provided can also depend on the group configuration setting. See 
[Node configuration using bdr.default_streaming_mode](#node-configuration-using-bdrdefault_streaming_mode) for details.

### Group configuration using bdr.alter_node_group_config()

You can use the parameter `streaming_mode` in the function [bdr.alter_node_group_config()](nodes#bdralter_node_group_config)
to set the group transaction streaming configuration.

Permitted values are:

-   `off`
-   `writer`
-   `file`
-   `auto`
-   `default`

The default value is `default`.

The value of the current setting is contained in the column `node_group_streaming_mode`
from the view [bdr.node_group](catalogs#bdrnode_group). The value returned is
a single char type, and the possible values are `D` (`default`), `W` (`writer`),
`F` (`file`), `A` (`auto`), and `O` (`off`).

### Configuration setting effects

Transaction streaming is controlled at the subscriber level by the GUC
`bdr.default_streaming_mode`. Unless set to `off` (which disables transaction
streaming), the subscriber requests transaction streaming.

If the publisher can provide transaction streaming, it
streams transactions whenever the transaction size exceeds the threshold set in
`logical_decoding_work_mem`. The publisher usually has no control over whether
the transactions is streamed to a file or to a writer. Except for some
situations (such as COPY), it might hint for the subscriber to stream the
transaction to a writer (if possible).

The subscriber can stream transactions received from the publisher to
either a writer or a file. The decision is based on several factors:

-   If parallel apply is off (`num_writers = 1`), then it's streamed to a file.
    (writer 0 is always reserved for non-streamed transactions.)
-   If parallel apply is on but all writers are already busy handling streamed
    transactions, then the new transaction is streamed to a file. See
    [bdr.writers](../monitoring#monitoring-bdr-writers) to check BDR
    writer status.

If streaming to a writer is possible (that is, a free writer is available), then the
decision whether to stream the transaction to a writer or a file is based on
the combination of group and node settings as per the following table:

| Group   | Node   | Streamed to |
| ------- | ------ | ----------- |
| off     | (any)  | (none)      |
| (any)   | off    | (none)      |
| writer  | file   | file        |
| file    | writer | file        |
| default | writer | writer      |
| default | file   | file        |
| default | auto   | writer      |
| auto    | (any)  | writer      |

If the group configuration is set to `auto`, or the group
configuration is `default` and the node configuration is `auto`,
then the transaction is streamed to a writer only if the
publisher hinted to do this.

Currently the publisher hints for the subscriber to stream to the writer
for the following transaction types. These are known to be conflict free
and can be safely handled by the writer.

-   `COPY`
-   `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`

## Monitoring

You can monitor the use of transaction streaming using the [bdr.stat_subscription](catalogs#bdrstat_subscription)
function on the subscriber node.

-   `nstream_writer` &mdash; Number of transactions streamed to a writer.
-   `nstream_file` &mdash; Number of transactions streamed to file.
-   `nstream_commit` &mdash; Number of committed streamed transactions.
-   `nstream_abort` &mdash; Number of aborted streamed transactions.
-   `nstream_start` &mdash; Number of streamed transactions that were started.
-   `nstream_stop` &mdash; Number of streamed transactions that were fully received.
