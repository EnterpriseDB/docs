### `bdr.conflict_history`

This table is the default table where conflicts are logged. The table is
RANGE partitioned on column `local_time` and is managed by Autopartition.
The default data retention period is 30 days.

Access to this table is possible by any table owner, who can see all
conflicts for the tables they own, restricted by row-level security.

For details, see [Logging conflicts to a table](conflicts).

### `bdr.camo_decision_journal`

A persistent journal of decisions resolved by a CAMO partner node
after a failover, in case `bdr.logical_transaction_status` was
invoked. Unlike `bdr.node_pre_commit`, this doesn't cover
transactions processed under normal operational conditions (i.e., both
nodes of a CAMO pair are running and connected). Entries in this journal
aren't ever cleaned up automatically. This is a diagnostic
tool that the system doesn't depend on.

### `bdr.global_lock`

This catalog table stores the information needed for recovering the

| `local_lock_request_time`  | timestamptz | Time the local node started trying to acquire the local lock      |
| `last_state_change_time`   | timestamptz | Time `acquire_stage` last changed                                 |

Column details:

-   `relation`: For DML locks, `relation` shows the relation on which the DML
    lock is acquired. For global advisory locks, `relation` column actually shows
    the two 32-bit integers or one 64-bit integer on which the lock is acquired.

-   `origin_node_id` and `origin_node_name`: If these are the same as the local
    node's ID and name, then the local node is the initiator of the global DDL
    lock, i.e., it is the node running the acquiring transaction. If these fields
    specify a different node, then the local node is instead trying to acquire its
    local DDL lock to satisfy a global DDL lock request from a remote node.

-   `pid`: The process ID of the process that requested the global DDL lock,
    if the local node is the requesting node. Null on other nodes. Query the
    origin node to determine the locker pid.

-   `global_lock_request_time`: The timestamp at which the global-lock request
    initiator started the process of acquiring a global lock. Can be null if
    unknown on the current node. This time is stamped at the beginning
    of the DDL lock request and includes the time taken for DDL epoch management
    and any required flushes of pending-replication queues. Currently only
    known on origin node.

-   `local_lock_request_time`: The timestamp at which the local node started
    trying to acquire the local lock for this global lock. This includes the
    time taken for the heavyweight session lock acquire but doesn't include
    any time taken on DDL epochs or queue flushing. If the lock is reacquired
    after local node restart, it becomes the node restart time.

-   `last_state_change_time`: The timestamp at which the
    `bdr.global_locks.acquire_stage` field last changed for this global lock
    entry.

### `bdr.replication_status`

This view shows incoming replication status between the local node and
all other nodes in the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster. We consider replication to be
blocked when the subscription restarted from the same LSN at least
twice and not a single transaction is yet applied after the current
upstream connection was established. If the first transaction after
restart is very big and still being applied, the `replication_blocked`
result might be wrong.

If this is a logical standby node, then only the status for its upstream
node is shown. Similarly, replication status isn't shown for
subscriber-only nodes since they never send replication changes to other
nodes.

### `bdr.worker_tasks`

The `bdr.worker_tasks` view shows BDR's current worker launch rate
limiting state as well as some basic statistics on background worker launch
and registration activity.

Unlike the other views listed here, it isn't specific to the current database
and BDR node. State for all BDR nodes on the current PostgreSQL
instance is shown. Join on the current database to filter it.

`bdr.worker_tasks` doesn't track walsenders and output plugins.

`bdr.sequences` for diagnostic purposes.

#### `bdr.sequence_kind` columns

| Name    | Type | Description                                                 |
| ------- | ---- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| seqid   | oid  | Internal OID of the sequence                                |
| seqkind | char | Internal sequence kind ('l'=local,'t'=timeshard,'s'=snowflakeid,'g'=galloc) |

### `bdr.state_journal`

An internal node state journal. Use `bdr.state_journal_details` for
diagnostic purposes instead.

### `bdr.state_journal_details`

Every change of node state of each node is logged permanently in `bdr.state_journal`
for diagnostic purposes.
This view provides node names and human-readable state names and carries all of
the information in that journal.
Once a node has successfully joined, the last state entry is
`BDR_PEER_STATE_ACTIVE`. This differs from the state of each replication connection
listed in `bdr.node_slots.state`.
