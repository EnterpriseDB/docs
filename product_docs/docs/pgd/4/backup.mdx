In this chapter we discuss the backup and restore of a BDR cluster.

BDR is designed to be a distributed, highly available system. If
one or more nodes of a cluster are lost, the best way to replace them
is to clone new nodes directly from the remaining nodes.

The role of backup and recovery in BDR is to provide for Disaster
Recovery (DR), such as in the following situations:

-   Loss of all nodes in the cluster
-   Significant, uncorrectable data corruption across multiple nodes
    as a result of data corruption, application error or
    security breach

## Backup

### `pg_dump`

`pg_dump`, sometimes referred to as "logical backup", can be used
normally with BDR.

Note that `pg_dump` dumps both local and global sequences as if
they were local sequences. This is intentional, to allow a BDR
schema to be dumped and ported to other PostgreSQL databases.
This means that sequence kind metadata is lost at the time of dump,
so a restore would effectively reset all sequence kinds to
the value of `bdr.default_sequence_kind` at time of restore.

To create a post-restore script to reset the precise sequence kind
for each sequence, you might want to use an SQL script like this:

```sql
SELECT 'SELECT bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind('''||
		nspname||'.'||relname||''','''||seqkind||''');'
FROM bdr.sequences
WHERE seqkind != 'local';
```

Note that if `pg_dump` is run using `bdr.crdt_raw_value = on` then the
dump can only be reloaded with `bdr.crdt_raw_value = on`.

Technical Support recommends the use of physical backup techniques for
backup and recovery of BDR.

### Physical Backup

Physical backups of a node in a BDR cluster can be taken using
standard PostgreSQL software, such as
[Barman](https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/resources/barman/).

A physical backup of a BDR node can be performed with the same
procedure that applies to any PostgreSQL node: a BDR node is just a
PostgreSQL node running the BDR extension.

There are some specific points that must be considered when applying
PostgreSQL backup techniques to BDR:

-   BDR operates at the level of a single database, while a physical
    backup includes all the databases in the instance; you should plan
    your databases to allow them to be easily backed-up and restored.

-   Backups will make a copy of just one node. In the simplest case,
    every node has a copy of all data, so you would need to backup only
    one node to capture all data. However, the goal of BDR will not be
    met if the site containing that single copy goes down, so the
    minimum should be at least one node backup per site (obviously with
    many copies etc.).

-   However, each node may have un-replicated local data, and/or the
    definition of replication sets may be complex so that all nodes do
    not subscribe to all replication sets. In these cases, backup
    planning must also include plans for how to backup any unreplicated
    local data and a backup of at least one node that subscribes to each
    replication set.

### Eventual Consistency

The nodes in a BDR cluster are *eventually consistent*, but not
entirely *consistent*; a physical backup of a given node will
provide Point-In-Time Recovery capabilities limited to the states
actually assumed by that node (see the [Example] below).

The following example shows how two nodes in the same BDR cluster might not 
(and usually do not) go through the same sequence of states.

Consider a cluster with two nodes `N1` and `N2`, which is initially in
state `S`. If transaction `W1` is applied to node `N1`, and at the same
time a non-conflicting transaction `W2` is applied to node `N2`, then
node `N1` will go through the following states:

```
(N1)   S  -->  S + W1  -->  S + W1 + W2
```

...while node `N2` will go through the following states:

```
(N2)   S  -->  S + W2  -->  S + W1 + W2
```

That is: node `N1` will *never* assume state `S + W2`, and node `N2`
likewise will never assume state `S + W1`, but both nodes will end up
in the same state `S + W1 + W2`. Considering this situation might affect how 
you decide upon your backup strategy.

### Point-In-Time Recovery (PITR)

In the example above, the changes are also inconsistent in time, since
`W1` and `W2` both occur at time `T1`, but the change `W1` is not
applied to `N2` until `T2`.

PostgreSQL PITR is designed around the assumption of changes arriving
from a single master in COMMIT order. Thus, PITR is possible by simply
scanning through changes until one particular point-in-time (PIT) is reached.
With this scheme, you can restore one node to a single point-in-time
from its viewpoint, e.g. `T1`, but that state would not include other
data from other nodes that had committed near that time but had not yet
arrived on the node. As a result, the recovery might be considered to
be partially inconsistent, or at least consistent for only one
replication origin.

To request this, use the standard syntax:

```
recovery_target_time = T1
```

BDR allows for changes from multiple masters, all recorded within the
WAL log for one node, separately identified using replication origin
identifiers.

BDR allows PITR of all or some replication origins to a specific point in time, 
providing a fully consistent viewpoint across all subsets of nodes.

Thus for multi-origins, we view the WAL stream as containing multiple
streams all mixed up into one larger stream. There is still just one PIT,
but that will be reached as different points for each origin separately.

We read the WAL stream until requested origins have found their PIT. We
apply all changes up until that point, except that we do not mark as committed
any transaction records for an origin after the PIT on that origin has been
reached.

We end up with one LSN "stopping point" in WAL, but we also have one single
timestamp applied consistently, just as we do with "single origin PITR".

Once we have reached the defined PIT, a later one may also be set to allow
the recovery to continue, as needed.

After the desired stopping point has been reached, if the recovered server
will be promoted, shut it down first and move the LSN forwards using
`pg_resetwal` to an LSN value higher than used on any timeline on this server.
This ensures that there will be no duplicate LSNs produced by logical
decoding.

In the specific example above, `N1` would be restored to `T1`, but
would also include changes from other nodes that have been committed
by `T1`, even though they were not applied on `N1` until later.

To request multi-origin PITR, use the standard syntax in
the recovery.conf file:

```
recovery_target_time = T1
```

The list of replication origins which would be restored to `T1` need either
to be specified in a separate multi_recovery.conf file via the use of
a new parameter `recovery_target_origins`:

```
recovery_target_origins = '*'
```

...or one can specify the origin subset as a list in `recovery_target_origins`.

```
recovery_target_origins = '1,3'
```

Note that the local WAL activity recovery to the specified
`recovery_target_time` is always performed implicitly. For origins
that are not specified in `recovery_target_origins`, recovery may
stop at any point, depending on when the target for the list
mentioned in `recovery_target_origins` is achieved.

In the absence of the `multi_recovery.conf` file, the recovery defaults
to the original PostgreSQL PITR behaviour that is designed around the assumption
of changes arriving from a single master in COMMIT order.

!!! Note
    This is feature is only available on EDB Postgres Extended and 
    Barman does not currently automatically create a `multi_recovery.conf` file.

## Restore

While you can take a physical backup with the same procedure as a
standard PostgreSQL node, what is slightly more complex is
**restoring** the physical backup of a BDR node.

### BDR Cluster Failure or Seeding a New Cluster from a Backup

The most common use case for restoring a physical backup involves the failure
or replacement of all the BDR nodes in a cluster, for instance in the event of
a datacentre failure.

You may also want to perform this procedure to clone the current contents of a
BDR cluster to seed a QA or development instance.

In that case, BDR capabilities can be restored based on a physical backup
of a single BDR node, optionally plus WAL archives:

-   If you still have some BDR nodes live and running, fence off the host you
    restored the BDR node to, so it cannot connect to any surviving BDR nodes.
    This ensures that the new node does not confuse the existing cluster.
-   Restore a single PostgreSQL node from a physical backup of one of
    the BDR nodes.
-   If you have WAL archives associated with the backup, create a suitable
    `recovery.conf` and start PostgreSQL in recovery to replay up to the latest
    state. You can specify a alternative `recovery_target` here if needed.
-   Start the restored node, or promote it to read/write if it was in standby
    recovery. Keep it fenced from any surviving nodes!
-   Clean up any leftover BDR metadata that was included in the physical backup,
    as described below.
-   Fully stop and restart the PostgreSQL instance.
-   Add further BDR nodes with the standard procedure based on the
    `bdr.join_node_group()` function call.

#### Cleanup BDR Metadata

The cleaning of leftover BDR metadata is achieved as follows:

1.  Drop the BDR node using `bdr.drop_node`
2.  Fully stop and re-start PostgreSQL (important!).

#### Cleanup of Replication Origins

Replication origins must be explicitly removed with a separate step
because they are recorded persistently in a system catalog, and
therefore included in the backup and in the restored instance. They
are not removed automatically when dropping the BDR extension, because
they are not explicitly recorded as its dependencies.

BDR creates one replication origin for each remote master node, to
track progress of incoming replication in a crash-safe way. Therefore
we need to run:

```
SELECT pg_replication_origin_drop('bdr_dbname_grpname_nodename');
```

...once for each node in the (previous) cluster. Replication origins can
be listed as follows:

```
SELECT * FROM pg_replication_origin;
```

...and those created by BDR are easily recognized by their name, as in
the example shown above.

#### Cleanup of Replication Slots

If a physical backup was created with `pg_basebackup`, replication slots
will be omitted from the backup.

Some other backup methods may preserve replications slots, likely in
outdated or invalid states. Once you restore the backup, just:

```
SELECT pg_drop_replication_slot(slot_name)
FROM pg_replication_slots;
```

...to drop *all* replication slots. If you have a reason to preserve some,
you can add a `WHERE slot_name LIKE 'bdr%'` clause, but this is rarely
useful.

!!! Warning
    Never run this on a live BDR node.
