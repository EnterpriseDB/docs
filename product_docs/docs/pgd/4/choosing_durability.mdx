EDB Postgres Distributed allows you to choose from several replication configurations based on your consistency, availability, and performance needs:

* Asynchronous
* Synchronous (using `synchronous_standby_names`)
* [Commit at Most Once](/bdr/latest/camo)
* [Eager](/bdr/latest/eager)
* [Group Commit](/bdr/latest/group_commit)


For more information, see [Durability](/bdr/latest/durability).
