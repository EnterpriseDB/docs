The following steps setup EDB Distributed Postgres with the Always-ON Silver
architecture using Amazon EC2.

First, we generate configuration file using the `configure` command:
```
$ tpaexec configure myedbdpcluster --architecture BDR-Always-ONO --layout Silver --platform aws
```

This will create a subdirectory directory in current working directory called
`myedbdpcluster`. In that directory there will be `config.yml` with configuration
TPAexec needs to crate the cluster. You can edit the `config.yml` as needed,
for example changing the ip address range used for servers, or adjusting locations
of nodes.

Next, we provision the cluster, in the case of the current example, this will
create the EC2 instances, configure VPC, etc:
```
tpaexec provision myedbdpcluster
```

Finally, we can deploy the needed packages, configuration and setup the actual
EDB Distributed Postgres cluster:
```
tpaexec deploy myedbdpcluster
```

After the successful run of the `deploy` command the cluster will be ready to use,
use can connect to it via `psql`, or any other database client.

It's also possible to run a test that ensures the cluster is running as expected:
```
tpaexec test myedbdpcluster
```
