The standard way of deploying EDB Distributed Postgres in self managed setting,
including physical and virtual machines, both self-hosted and in the cloud
(EC2) is to use EDB's deployment tool called TPAexec.

TPAexec is an orchestration tool which can be used to build Postgres clusters
according to a Trusted Postgres Architecture (TPA) specification.

TPA represents the best practices followed by EDB and its
recommendations are as applicable to quick testbed setups as to production
environments.
