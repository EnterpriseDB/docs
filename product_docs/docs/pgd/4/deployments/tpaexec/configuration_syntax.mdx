TAKEN FROM: https://documentation.enterprisedb.com/tpa/release/22.13-1/architecture-BDR-Always-ON/

The BDR-Always-ON architecture configuration is intended for use in production. HARP2 is enabled by default in BDR-Always-ON architecture.

You can select from four variants, using the --layout configure option:

- bronze: 2×bdr+primary, bdr+witness, barman, 2×harp-proxy

- silver: bronze, with bdr+witness promoted to bdr+primary, and barman moved to separate location

- gold: two symmetric locations with 2×bdr+primary, 2×harp-proxy, and barman each; plus a bdr+witness in a third location

- platinum: gold, but with one bdr+readonly (logical standby) added to each of the main locations

See [Architectures](/pgd/4/architectures) for the detailed layout diagrams.

For example, 

```
[tpa]$ tpaexec configure ~/clusters/bdr \
         --architecture BDR-Always-ON \
         --layout gold \
         --platform aws --region eu-west-1 --instance-type t3.micro \
         --distribution Debian-minimal
```

| Flags  | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| --architecture BDR-Always-ON | Required. Produces a working configuration. |
| --layout layoutname          | Required. Specify one of the supported BDR use-case variations: bronze, silver, gold, and platinum. The bronze, gold, and platinum layouts have a BDR witness node to ensure odd number of nodes for Raft consensus majority. Witness nodes do not participate in the data replication. |
| --bdr-node-group groupname   | Optional. Set the name of the BDR node group. The default is bdrgroup. |
| --bdr-database dbname        | Optional. Set the name of the database with BDR enabled. The default is bdrdb. |
| --enable-camo                | Optional. Set the pair of BDR primary instances in each region to be each other's CAMO partners. |
