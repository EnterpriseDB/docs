## Creating the PGD cluster

* **Create connection strings for each node.**  
For each node, create a connection string that will allow PGD to perform replication.

 The connection string is a key/value string that starts with `host=` and the IP address of the host (or, if you have resolvable named hosts, the name of the host).

 That's followed by the name of the database: `dbname=bdrdb`. (The `bdrdb` database was created while [installing the software](04-installing-software).)

 We recommend you also add the port number of the server to your connection string as `port=5444` for EDB Postgres Advanced Server and `port=5432` for EDB Postgres Extended and community PostgreSQL.


* **Prepare the first node.** 
To create the cluster, log into the `bdrdb` database on one of the nodes.


* **Create the first node.**  
  Run `bdr.create_node` and give the node a name and its connection string where *other* nodes can connect to it.
  * Create the top-level group.
    Create a top-level group for the cluster with `bdr.create_node_group`, giving it a single parameter: the name of the top-level group.
  * Create a subgroup.
    Create a subgroup as a child of the top-level group with `bdr.create_node_group`, giving it two parameters: the name of the subgroup and the name of the parent (and top-level) group.
  This sequence initializes the first node.


* **Add the second node.**
  * Create the second node.  
    Log into another initialized node's `bdrdb` database.
    Run `bdr.create_node` and give the node a different name and its connection string where *other* nodes can connect to it.
  * Join the second node to the cluster.
    Next, run `bdr.join_node_group`, passing two parameters: the connection string for the first node and the name of the subgroup you want the node to join.


* **Add the third node.**
  * Create the third node.
    Log into another initialized node's `bdrdb` database.
    Run `bdr.create_node` and give the node a different name and its connection string where *other* nodes can connect to it.
  * Join the third node to the cluster.
    Next, run `bdr.join_node_group`, passing two parameters: the connection string for the first node and the name of the subgroup you want the node to join.


## Worked example

So far, this example has:

* Created three hosts.
* Installed a Postgres server on each host.
* Installed Postgres Distributed on each host.
* Configured the Postgres server to work with PGD on each host.

To create the cluster, tell the `host-one` Postgres instance that it's a PGD node (`node-one`) and create PGD groups on that node.
Then tell the `host-two` and `host-three` Postgres instances that they're PGD nodes (`node-two` and `node-three`) and that they should join a group on `node-one`.

### Create connection strings for each node

Calculate the connection strings for each of the nodes in advance. 
Following are the connection strings for this 3-node example:

| Name       | Node Name  | Private IP      | Connection string                      |
| ---------- | ---------- | --------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| host-one   | node-one   | 192.168.254.166 | host=host-one dbname=bdrdb port=5444   |
| host-two   | node-two   | 192.168.254.247 | host=host-two dbname=bdrdb port=5444   |
| host-three | node-three | 192.167.254.135 | host=host-three dbname=bdrdb port=5444 |

### Preparing the first node 

Log into the `host-one` Postgres server.

```
ssh admin@host-one
sudo -iu enterprisedb psql bdrdb
```

### Create the first node

Call the [`bdr.create_node`](/pgd/4/bdr/nodes#bdrcreate_node) function to create a node, passing it the node name and a connection string that other nodes can use to connect to it.

```
select bdr.create_node('node-one','host=host-one dbname=bdrdb port=5444');
```

#### Create the top-level group

Call the [`bdr.create_node_group`](/pgd/4/bdr/nodes#bdrcreate_node_group) function to create a top-level group for your PGD cluster. Passing a single string parameter creates the top-level group with that name. For this example, create a top-level group named `pgd`:

```
select bdr.create_node_group('pgd');
```

#### Create a subgroup

Using subgroups to organize your nodes is preferred as it allows services like PGD Proxy, which you'll configured later in this example, to coordinate their operations.
In a larger PGD installation, multiple subgroups can exist providing organizational grouping that enables geographical mapping of clusters and localized resilience. 
For that reason, this example creates a subgroup for the first nodes to enable simpler expansion and use of PGD Proxy.

Call the [`bdr.create_node_group`](/pgd/4/bdr/nodes/#bdrcreate_node) function again to create a subgroup of the top-level group. 
The subgroup name is the first parameter, and the parent group is the second parameter. 
This example creates a subgroup `dc1` as a child of `pgd`:


```
select bdr.create_node_group('dc1','pgd');
```

### Add the second node

Log into the `host-two` Postgres server:

```
ssh admin@host-two
sudo -iu enterprisedb psql bdrdb
```

#### Create the second node

Call the [`bdr.create_node`](/pgd/4/bdr/nodes/#bdrcreate_node) function to create this node, passing it the node name and a connection string that other nodes can use to connect to it:

```
select bdr.create_node('node-two','host=host-two dbname=bdrdb port=5444');
```

#### Join the second node to the cluster

Using [`bdr.join_node_group`](/pgd/4/bdr/nodes/#bdrjoin_node_group), you can ask `node-two` to join the `node-one` `dc1` group. The function takes as a first parameter the connection string of a node already in the group. It takes the group name as a second parameter.

```
select bdr.join_node_group('host=host-one dbname=bdrdb port=5444','dc1');
```

### Add the third node

Log into the `host-three` Postgres server.

```
ssh admin@host-three
sudo -iu enterprisedb psql bdrdb
```

#### Create the third node

Call the [`bdr.create_node`](/pgd/4/bdr/nodes/#bdrcreate_node) function to create this node, passing it the node name and a connection string that other nodes can use to connect to it:

```
select bdr.create_node('node-three','host=host-three dbname=bdrdb port=5444');
```

#### Join the third node to the cluster

Using [`bdr.join_node_group`](/pgd/4/bdr/nodes/#bdrjoin_node_group), you can ask `node-three` to join the `node-one` `dc1` group. The function takes as a first parameter the connection string of a node already in the group. It takes the group name as a second parameter.

```
select bdr.join_node_group('host=host-one dbname=bdrdb port=5444','dc1');
```

These steps have now created a PGD cluster.
