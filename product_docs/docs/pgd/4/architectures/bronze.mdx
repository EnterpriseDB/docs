The AlwaysOn Bronze architecture includes the following:

-  Two BDR data nodes
-  One BDR witness node that doesn't hold data but is used for consensus
-  Two HARP-Proxy nodes for routing application traffic to the "lead" master
-  One barman node for backup and recovery can be onsite or offsite

BDR and HARP-Proxy nodes should be spread across availability zones.
