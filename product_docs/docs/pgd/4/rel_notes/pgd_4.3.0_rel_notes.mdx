| Component | Version |  Type           |                                                   Description                                                           |
| --------- | ------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BDR       | 4.3.0   | Bug fix         | Handle ALTER TABLE...ALTER COLUMN...TYPE...on a non-data node (BDR-2768 RT86808) <p> A global DML lock is required if a table rewrite is needed, however this cannot be taken if the query is executed on a non-data node (logical standby or subscriber-only). </p> |
| BDR       | 4.3.0   | Bug fix         | Separate autopartition leader from Raft leader (BDR-2721) <p> Raft leader can be a witness node but autopartitioning can only be managed on data nodes. This change ensures that autopatition leader is always a data node. </p> |
| BDR       | 4.3.0   | Feature         | Implement bdr.alter node_kind() <p> Function to change a node kind, the kind can also be checked in bdr.node now. </p> |
| BDR       | 4.3.0   | Bug fix         | Replicate bdr admin functions to standbys (BDR-1575, RT72698) <p> Always replicate the function call also for the writter process. </p> |
| BDR       | 4.3.0   | Bug fix         | Fix watermark handling on clusters with multiple sub-groups <p> Watermark is used to ensure data consistency during join. Previously, this didn't work correctly in the presence of multiple data sub-groups. </p> |
| BDR       | 4.3.0   | Bug fix         | Don't allow switching to CAMO Local Mode if the node is not a write lead <p> In CAMO only one node should be allowed to switch to the Local Mode at given time. We now require the node to be the HARP write leader in order to ensure that rule. </p> |
| HARP      | 2.2.2   | Change          | Upgrade 3rd party dependencies to fix Github dependabot alerts |
