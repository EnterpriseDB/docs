| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Bug&nbsp;fix | Override bdr.ddl_replication=off in taskmgr worker. |
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Bug&nbsp;fix | Avoid a potential deadlock between `bdr.autopartition_wait_for_partitions()` and taskmgr|
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Bug&nbsp;fix | Block new EPAS automatic partitioning on PGD cluster. |
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Bug&nbsp;fix | Block PGD Autopartition on EPAS INTERVAL partitioned table. |
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Bug&nbsp;fix | Fix memory leak in streaming transaction processing. |
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Bug&nbsp;fix | Allow force parting of nodes that are already being parted normally. |
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Bug&nbsp;fix | Fix nodes getting stuck on PART_CATCHUP due to replication slot conflict. |
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Bug&nbsp;fix | Fix nodes getting stuck on PART_CATCHUP due to node_catchup_info conflict. |
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Bug&nbsp;fix | Fix row filter failure for partitions created after a table column was dropped (RT95149) |
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Bug&nbsp;fix | Ensure that replication receiver worker reloads configuration correctly when `pg_reload_conf()` is called. |
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Bug&nbsp;fix | Prevent duplicate Raft request ID generation which could break replication. |
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Bug&nbsp;fix | Fix several rare memory access issues that could potentially cause crashes of workers. |
