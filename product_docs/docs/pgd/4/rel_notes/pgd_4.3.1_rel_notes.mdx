| --------- | ------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BDR       | 4.3.1   | Feature         | Added pid to the log message emitted upon writer process death. |
| BDR       | 4.3.1   | Feature         | Made Raft leader step down on loss of quorum (isolated). |
| BDR       | 4.3.1   | Bug fix         | Fixed memory leak in consensus process (RT91830). |
| BDR       | 4.3.1   | Bug fix         | Fixed issue where a node can be inconsistent with the group after rejoining. If a node was part of a subgroup, parted, and then rejoined to the group, it might be inconsistent with the group. The changes from some nodes of the group would be replayed from a wrong starting point, resulting in potential data loss. |
| BDR       | 4.3.1   | Bug fix         | Fixed join and replication when SDW and standby_slot_names are set (RT89702, RT89536). |
| BDR       | 4.3.1   | Bug fix         | Fixed spurious warnings when processing sequence options (RT90668). |
| BDR       | 4.3.1   | Bug fix         | Fixed upgrades for nodes with CRDTs. |
| BDR       | 4.3.1   | Bug fix         | Fixed replication for subgroup nodes (RT89814). If a node was part of a subgroup, parted, and then rejoined to the group, it might be inconsistent with the group. The changes from some nodes of the group would be replayed from a wrong starting point, resulting in potential data loss. |
| BDR       | 4.3.1   | Bug fix         | Adjusted lag tracking parameters for LCRs from `pg_stat_replication`.  |
| BDR       | 4.3.1   | Bug fix         | Converted all sequences to `distributed` during create node. |
| BDR       | 4.3.1   | Bug fix         | Fixed streaming transactions with standby_slot_names. This might have led to a subscriber-only node getting ahead of a data node.|
| BDR       | 4.3.1   | Bug fix         | Reload configuration for the pglogical receiver. Reload and apply the configuration changes when the server receives reload signal. |
| BDR       | 4.3.1   | Enhancement     | Avoid restarting sync workers. This enhancement is to prevent the node join from failing when config changes are made that signal the restart of subscription workers. |
| CLI       | 1.1.1   | Change          | Upgraded third-party dependencies to fix Github dependabot alerts. |
| HARP      | 2.2.3   | Bug fix         | Updated consensus check to use `bdr.get_raft_status` instead of `bdr.monitor_group_raft`. |
| Utilities | 1.1.0   | Bug fix         | Fixed handle uninitialized physical replication slots issue.  |
