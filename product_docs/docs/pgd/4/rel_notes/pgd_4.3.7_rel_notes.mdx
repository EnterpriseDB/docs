## Bug Fixes

<table class="table w-100"><thead><tr><th>Component</th><th>Version</th><th>Description</th><th width="10%">Addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>BDR</td><td>4.3.7</td><td><details><summary>Unsupported `ALTER TABLE` command on materialized views is no longer replicated.</summary><hr/><p>Replication no longer becomes stuck when the command is issued.</p>
  <tr><td>BDR</td><td>4.3.7</td><td><details><summary>Fixed a bug where `bdr_init_physical` stopped responding when `synchronous_commit` is set to `remote_write/remote_apply`.</summary><hr/><p>`bdr_init_physical` disables synchronous replication on a new node by resetting `synchronous_standby_names` to an empty string. A warning message reminds you to set `synchronous_standby_names` as needed.</p>
    <tr><td>BDR</td><td>4.3.7</td><td><details><summary>Fixed a bug to handle additional replication sets on witness nodes.</summary><hr/><p>The witness node now only cares about the top replication set and thus allows it to miss replications sets and not error out.</p>
      <tr><td>BDR</td><td>4.3.7</td><td><details><summary>Fixed autopatition task scheduling.</summary><hr/><p>To improve reliability, shuffle the scheduling of autopartition tasks. This way, tasks that are prone to failure won't consistently impact the success of other tasks.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
