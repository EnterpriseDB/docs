| CLI | 1.0.0   | Feature | Ability to gather information such as the current state of replication, consensus, and nodes for an EDB Postgres Distributed cluster using new [command-line interface (CLI)](/pgd/latest/cli).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| BDR | 4.1.0   | Feature | Support [in-place major upgrades](/pgd/latest/upgrades/bdr_pg_upgrade/) of Postgres on a data node with a new command-line utility, bdr_pg_upgrade. This utility uses the standard pg_upgrade command, and reduces the time and network bandwidth needed to do major version upgrades of a EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| BDR                      | 4.1.0   | Feature | Enable the ability to configure a [replication lag threshold](/pgd/latest/bdr/lag-control/). After the threshold is met, the transaction commits get throttled. This threshold allows limiting RPO without incurring the latency impact on every transaction that comes with synchronous replication.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| BDR                      | 4.1.0   | Feature | [Global sequences](/pgd/latest/bdr/sequences/#bdr-global-sequences) are automatically configured based on data type replacing the need to set up custom sequence handling configuration on every node. The new SnowflakeID algorithm replaces Timeshard, which had limitations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| BDR                      | 4.1.0   | Feature | Add a new SQL-level interface for configuring synchronous replication durability and visibility options by group rather than by node. This approach allows you to configure all nodes consistently from a single place instead of using config files.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| BDR                      | 4.1.0   | Feature | Add a new synchronous replication option, [Group Commit](/pgd/latest/bdr/group-commit/), which allows a quorum to be required before committing a transaction in a EDB Postgres Distributed group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| BDR                      | 4.1.0   | Feature | Allow a Raft request to be required for CAMO switching to Local Mode. Add a `require_raft` flag to the CAMO pairing configuration which controls the behavior of switching from CAMO protected to Local Mode, introducing the option to require a majority of nodes to be connected to allow to switch to Local Mode. (RT78928)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| BDR                      | 4.1.0   | Feature | Allow replication to continue on `ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION CONCURRENTLY` of already detached partition. Similarly to how BDR 4 handles `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` when same index already exists, we now allow replication to continue when `ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION CONCURRENTLY` is receiver for partition that has been already detached. (RT78362)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| BDR                      | 4.1.0   | Feature | Add additional filtering options to DDL filters. DDL filters allow for replication of different DDL statements to different replication sets. Similar to how table membership in replication set allows DML on different tables to be replicated via different replication sets. This release adds new controls that make it easier to use the DDL filters:<br />   - query_match - if defined query must match this regex<br />   - exclusive - if true, other matched filters are not taken into consideration (i.e. only the exclusive filter is applied), when multiple exclusive filters match, we throw error                                                |
| BDR                      | 4.1.0   | Feature | Add `bdr.lock_table_locking` configuration variable. When enabled this changes behavior of `LOCK TABLE` command to take take a global DML lock                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| BDR                      | 4.1.0   | Feature | Implement buffered write for LCR segment file. This should reduce I/O and improve CPU usage of the Decoding Worker.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| BDR                      | 4.1.0   | Feature | Add support for partial unique index lookups for conflict detection. Indexes on expression are however still not supported for conflict detection. (RT78368)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| BDR                      | 4.1.0   | Feature | Add additional statistics to `bdr.stat_subscription`:<br />   - nstream_insert => the count of INSERTs on streamed transactions<br />   - nstream_update => the count of UPDATEs on streamed transactions<br />   - nstream_delete => the count of DELETEs on streamed transactions<br />   - nstream_truncate => the count of TRUNCATEs on streamed transactions<br />   - npre_commit_confirmations => the count pre-commit confirmations, when using CAMO<br />   - npre_commit => the count of pre-commits<br />   - ncommit_prepared => the count of prepared commits with 2PC<br />   - nabort_prepared => the count of aborts of prepared transactions with 2PC |
| BDR                      | 4.1.0   | Feature | Add execute_locally option to bdr.replicate_ddl_command.This allows optional queueing of ddl commands for replication to other groups without executing it locally. (RT73533)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| BDR                      | 4.1.0   | Feature | Add `fast` argument to `bdr.alter_subscription_disable()`. The argument only influences the behavior of `immediate`.
