| Feature                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| Faster Postgres major version upgrade            | Postgres Distributed is the only Postgres high availability technology that allows fully online major version upgrades. This functionality is improved to allow upgrades in-place, without migrating data between nodes. Even the largest clusters can now be upgraded to the latest major version within minutes.                                                                                                                    |
| Replication lag control                          | If you use asynchronous replication, you can configure a replication lag threshold after which the transactions get throttled. This allows you to keep a low RPO without incurring the latency impact on every transaction that comes with synchronous replication.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| Distributed sequences by default                 | Instead of setting up custom sequence handling configuration on every node, you get distributed sequences configured automatically with the best kind of sequence for the data type used. The new SnowflakeID algorithm replaces Timeshard, which had constraints that prevented us from using it as a default.                                                                                          |
| Postgres Distributed Command Line Interface (CLI | You can get information about your Postgres Distributed cluster right from the CLI, including the current state of the replication, consensus, and nodes. You can also query across the nodes of a cluster. Instead of relying on queries, you can use simplified commands in the CLI.                                                                                                                                                        |
| Simplified synchronous replication configuration | Instead of adjusting multiple different Grand Unified Configurations (GUCs) for each node, you can use a SQL level interface to configure how transactions are replicated and what durability and visibility criteria to use, allowing for all nodes to be configured consistently from a single place. This allows (along with Group Commits) more functionality and flexibility around synchronous replication in the future. |
| Group Commit                                     | You can have synchronous replication to require quorum within a Postgres Distributed group before committing a transaction, making EDB a more attractive alternative to Oracle DataGuard or Postgres Synchronous Replication.  This allows more functionality around synchronous replication in the future, like Eager Majority.                                                                                                  |
