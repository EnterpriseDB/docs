intro: |
  EDB Postgres Distributed 4.3.7 is a minor release that includes several bug fixes and enhancements.
relnotes:
  - relnote: Unsupported `ALTER TABLE` command on materialized views is no longer replicated.
    component: BDR
    details: |
      Replication no longer becomes stuck when the command is issued.
    jira: BDR-5997
    addresses: ""
    type: Bug Fix
    impact: Lowest
  - relnote: Fixed a bug where `bdr_init_physical` stopped responding when `synchronous_commit` is set to `remote_write/remote_apply`.
    component: BDR
    details: |
      `bdr_init_physical` disables synchronous replication on a new node by resetting `synchronous_standby_names` to an empty string. A warning message reminds you to set `synchronous_standby_names` as needed.
    jira: BDR-5918
    addresses: 44760
    type: Bug Fix
    impact: Medium
  - relnote: Fixed a bug to handle additional replication sets on witness nodes.
    component: BDR
    details: |
      The witness node now only cares about the top replication set and thus allows it to miss replications sets and not error out.
    jira: BDR-5880
    addresses: "41776, 44527"
    type: Bug Fix
    impact: Low
  - relnote: Fixed autopatition task scheduling.
    component: BDR
    details: |
      To improve reliability, shuffle the scheduling of autopartition tasks. This way, tasks that are prone to failure won't consistently impact the success of other tasks.
