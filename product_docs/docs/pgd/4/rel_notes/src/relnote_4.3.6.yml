intro: |
  EDB Postgres Distributed 4.3.6 is a minor release that includes several bug fixes and enhancements.

  - HARP proxy settings patches to reduced bloat on consensus request and response journals.
  - Fix for accidental drop of autopartition rule when a column of the autopartitioned table is dropped.
relnotes:
- relnote: "bdr\_consensus: Add GUCs to control automatic Raft vacuum"
  component: BDR
  component_version: 4.3.6
  details: |
    Aggressive HARP proxy settings may face issues due to
    increased bloat on consensus request and response journals.
    This patch adds GUCs to control frequency of automatic vacuum on said
    catalogs. The `bdr.raft_vacuum_interval` GUC controls how frequently the
    tables are checked for VACUUM and ANALYZE. The Autovacuum GUCs and table
    reloptions are used to determine whether VACUUM/ANALYZE is needed or
    not.
    The `bdr.raft_vacuum_full_interval` triggers VACUUM FULL on the tables.
    The user can disable VACUUM FULL if normal VACUUM is sufficient to keep
    the bloat in control.

- relnote: Do not accidentally drop the autopartition rule when a column of the autopartitioned table is dropped.
  component: BDR
  component_version: 4.3.6
  details: |
    When ALTER TABLE .. DROP COLUMN is used, the object\_access\_hook is fired with `classId` set to RelationRelationId, but the `subId` is set to the attribute number to differentiate it from the DROP TABLE command. Therefore, we need to check the subId field to make sure that we are not performing actions that should only be triggered when a table is dropped.

- relnote: Cleanup unwanted data with drop_node
  component: BDR
  component_version: 4.3.6
  details: |
    When we drop the local node we cleanup all the catalog tables internally.

- relnote: Delete older logs if we get a snapshot that's already applied
  component: BDR
  component_version: 4.3.6
  details: |
    The follower doesn't need the older logs once a snapshot is applied. If
    we keep those around, the duplicate request id issue may keep happening.
    So clear the logs a bit more aggressively once we know they are not
    needed.

- relnote: Handling duplicate requests in RAFT preventing protocol breakage 
  component: BDR
  component_version: 4.3.6
  details: | 
    When processing RAFT entries, it's crucial to handle duplicate requests properly to prevent Raft protocol issues. Duplicate requests can occur when a client retries a request that has already been accepted and applied by the Raft leader. The problem arose when the leader failed to detect the duplicate request due to historical evidence being pruned.

  component: BDR
  component_version: 4.3.6
  details: | 
    When installing or importing a Raft snapshot, discard the consensus log unless it contains an entry matching the snapshot's last included entry and term.

- relnote: Allow ANALYZE on temp tables
  component: BDR
  component_version: 4.3.6
  details: |
    The ANALYZE statement is already not replicated. We dont need to filter
    if it's analyzing temp tables or not, we allow the user to analyze anything.

- relnote: Re-add function `bdr.column_timestamps_enable_internal()`
  component: BDR
  component_version: 4.3.6
  details: |
    This function was removed as the code can be merged with
    `bdr.column_timestamps_disable()`. However, although that function is
    deprecated, in a mixed-version cluster it could theoretically be called on an
    older node, resulting in `bdr.column_timestamps_enable_internal()` being
    replicated and causing an error on the nodes where it is no longer present.

- relnote: Fix duplicate ids generation for snowflakeid
  component: BDR
  component_version: 4.3.6
  details: |
    Disallow multiple backends which concurrently increment the sequences 
    to simultaneously initialize the sequence for same millisecond timestamp value,
    resulting in duplicate ids both with local seq id component as 0.

- relnote: Adjust `bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection()` to propagate correctly to all nodes
  component: BDR
  component_version: 4.3.6
  details: |
    Ensure that the propagation of `bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection()` (as well as the related, deprecated `bdr.column_timestamps_(en|dis)able()` functions) is carried out correctly to all logical standbys. Previously, this propagation did not occur if the logical standby was not directly attached to the node on which the functions were executed.

- relnote: Raft-related catalog items
  component: BDR
  component_version: 4.3.6
  details: |
    This adds compatibility objects for:
    
    - `bdr.raft_instances`
    - `bdr.get_raft_status(node_group_name text)`
    
    These additions ensure that Raft status queries operate correctly
    in clusters running multiple major versions.
