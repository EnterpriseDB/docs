## Upgrading within version 4

Beginning with version 4, EDB Postgres Distributed adopted [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). All changes within the same major version are backward compatible, lowering the risk when upgrading and allowing you to choose any later minor or patch release as the upgrade target. You can upgrade from any version 4.x release to a later 4.x release.


## Upgrading from version 3.7 to version 4

Generally, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version 3.7 release before
upgrading to the latest version 4 release. You must be using 3.7.15 or later 
before upgrading to 4. See [Upgrading within from 3.7](/pgd/3.7/bdr/upgrades/supported_paths/#upgrading-within-version-37) in the
3.7 documentation for more information. After upgrading to 3.7.15 or later, the
following upgrade paths are possible.

| From version | To versions (range) |
| ---- | -- |
| 3.7.15 | 4.0.2 to 4.2.1 |
| 3.7.16 | 4.0.2 to 4.2.1 |
| 3.7.17 | 4.2.0 to 4.2.1 |
| 3.7.18 | 4.2.1 only |
| 3.7.19 | 4.2.2 only |
| 3.7.20 | 4.3.0 to 4.3.2 |
| 3.7.21 | 4.3.1 to 4.3.2 |
| 3.7.22 | 4.3.2 only |

## Upgrading from version 3.6 to version 4

Currently, there are no direct upgrade paths from 3.6 to 4. You must first upgrade your cluster to 3.7 before upgrading to 4. See [Upgrading from 3.6](/pgd/3.7/bdr/upgrades/supported_paths/#upgrading-from-version-36) in the 3.7 documentation for more information.
