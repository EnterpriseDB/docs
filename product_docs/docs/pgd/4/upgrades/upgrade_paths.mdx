## Upgrading from version 3.6 to version 4

Currently there are no direct upgrade paths from 3.6 to 4.  You must first upgrade your cluster to 3.7 before upgrading to 4.  See [Upgrading from 3.6](/pgd/3.7/bdr/upgrades/supported_paths/#upgrading-from-version-36) in the 3.7 documentation for more information.

## Upgrading from version 3.7 to version 4

Currently it is recommended that you are using 3.7.15 or later before upgrading to 4. See [Upgrading within from 3.7](/pgd/3.7/bdr/updrades/supported_paths/#upgrading-within-version-37) in the 3.7 documentation for more information.  After upgrading to 3.7.15 or later the following combinations are allowed

| 3.7.15 | 3.7.16 | 3.7.17 | Target BDR version |
|--------|--------|--------|--------------------|
| X      | X      | X      | 4.2.0              |
| X      | X      |        | 4.1.1              |
| X      | X      |        | 4.1.0              |
| X      |        |        | 4.0.2              |

## Upgrading within version 4

Beginning with version 4, EDB Postgres Distributed has adopted semantic versioning. All changes within the same major will be backward compatible lowering the risk when upgrading and allowing you to choose any later minor or patch release as the upgrade target. 

| 4.0.0 | 4.0.1 | 4.0.2 | 4.1.0 | 4.1.1 | Target BDR version |
|-------|-------|-------|--------|------|--------------------|
| X     | X     | X     | X      | X    | 4.2.0              |
| X     | X     | X     | X      |      | 4.1.1              |
| X     | X     | X     |        |      | 4.1.0              |
