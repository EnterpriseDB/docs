## Upgrading within version 4

Beginning with version 4, EDB Postgres Distributed has adopted [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). All changes within the same major version will be backward compatible, lowering the risk when upgrading and allowing you to choose any later minor or patch release as the upgrade target. You can upgrade from any version 4.x release to a later 4.x release.


## Upgrading from version 3.7 to version 4

Generally, we recommend you upgrade to the latest version 3.7 release, before
upgrading to the latest version 4 release. You will have to be using 3.7.15 or later 
before upgrading to 4. See [Upgrading within from 3.7](/pgd/3.7/bdr/upgrades/supported_paths/#upgrading-within-version-37) in the
3.7 documentation for more information. After upgrading to 3.7.15 or later, the
following upgrade paths are possible.

| From version | To version |
| ---- | -- |
| 3.7.15 | 4.0.2 or later |
| 3.7.16 | 4.1.0 or later |
| 3.7.17 | Must be upgraded to a later 3.7.x version before upgrading |
| 3.7.18 | 4.2.1 or later |
| 3.7.19 | 4.2.2 or later |
| 3.7.20 | 4.3.0 or later |
| 3.7.21 | 4.3.1 or later |
| 3.7.22 | 4.3.2 or later |

## Upgrading from version 3.6 to version 4

Currently there are no direct upgrade paths from 3.6 to 4.  You must first upgrade your cluster to 3.7 before upgrading to 4.  See [Upgrading from 3.6](/pgd/3.7/bdr/upgrades/supported_paths/#upgrading-from-version-36) in the 3.7 documentation for more information.
