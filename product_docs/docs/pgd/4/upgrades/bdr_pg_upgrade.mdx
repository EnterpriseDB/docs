title: In-place Postgres Major Version Upgrades
---

Upgrading a BDR Node to a newer major version of Postgres is possible using the
command-line utility `bdr_pg_upgrade`.

`bdr_pg_upgrade` internally uses the standard [`pg_upgrade`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgupgrade.html)
with BDR specific logic to ensure a smooth upgrade.

## Terminology

Various terminology is used in this documentation to describe the upgrade process and components involved.

*old cluster* - The existing Postgres cluster node to be upgraded, which data will be migrated from.

*new cluster* - The new Postgres cluster, which data will be migrated to. This cluster node must be one (1) major version ahead of the old cluster.

## Precautions

Standard Postgres major version upgrade precautions apply, including the fact
that all the requirements for [`pg_upgrade`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgupgrade.html#id-1.9.5.12.7)
must be met by both clusters.

Additionaly, `bdr_pg_upgrade` should not be used if there are other tools using
replication slots and replication origins, only BDR slots and origins will be
restored after the upgrade.

There are several prerequisites for `bdr_pg_upgrade` that have to be met:

-   Applications using the old cluster have been disconnected, it can for example,
    be redirected to another node in the cluster
-   Peer authentication is configured for both clusters, `bdr_pg_upgrade`
    requires peer authentication
-   BDR versions on both clusters must be exactly the same and must be version
    4.1.0 or above
-   The new cluster must be in a shutdown state
-   BDR packages must be installed in the new cluster
-   The new cluster must be already initialized and configured as needed to
    match the old cluster configuration
-   Databases, tables, and other objects must not exist in the new cluster

It is also recommended to have the old cluster up prior to running `bdr_pg_upgrade`
as the CLI will start the old cluster if it is shutdown.

## Usage

To upgrade to a newer major version of Postgres, the new version must first
be installed.

### bdr_pg_upgrade command-line

`bdr_pg_upgrade` passes all parameters to `pg_upgrade`. Therefore, you can
specify any parameters supported by [`pg_upgrade`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgupgrade.html#id-1.9.5.12.6).

#### Synopsis

```shell
bdr_pg_upgrade [OPTION] ...
```

#### Options

In addition to the options for `pg_upgrade`, the following parameters are
can be passed to `bdr_pg_upgrade`:

-   `-b, --old-bindir` - old cluster bin directory (required)
-   `-B, --new-bindir`- new cluster bin directory (required)
-   `-d, --old-datadir` - old cluster data directory (required)
-   `-D, --new-datadir` - `REQUIRED` new cluster data directory (required)
-   `--database` - BDR database name (required)
-   `-p, --old-port` - old cluster port number
-   `-s, --socketdir` - directory to use for postmaster sockets during upgrade
-   `--check`- only perform checks, do not modify clusters


#### Environment Variables

Environment variables can be used in place of command line parameters.

-   `PGBINOLD` - old cluster bin directory
-   `PGBINNEW` - new cluster bin directory
-   `PGDATAOLD` - old cluster data directory
-   `PGDATANEW` - new cluster data directory
-   `PGPORTOLD` - old cluster port number
-   `PGSOCKETDIR` - directory to use for postmaster sockets during upgrade


### Example

Given a scenario where:

-   Old cluster bin directory is `/usr/lib/postgresql/13/bin`
-   New cluster bin directory is `/usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin`
-   Old cluster data directory is `/var/lib/postgresql/13/main`
-   New cluster data directory is `/var/lib/postgresql/14/main`
-   Database name is `bdrdb`


The following command could be used to upgrade the cluster:

```
bdr_pg_upgrade \
--old-bindir /usr/lib/postgresql/13/bin \
--new-bindir /usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin \
--old-datadir /var/lib/postgresql/13/main \
--new-datadir /var/lib/postgresql/14/main \
--database bdrdb
```

### Steps Performed

Steps performed when running `bdr_pg_upgrade`.

!!! Note
    When `--check` is supplied as an argument to `bdr_pg_upgrade`, the CLI
    will `skip` steps that modify the database.
