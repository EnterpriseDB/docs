EDB Postgres Distributed allows a PGD cluster to be administered without giving access to the stored data by design. It achieves this through the use of roles and controlled access to system objects.

* [Roles](roles) introduces the roles that PGD predefines for controlling access to PGD functionality.

* [Role management](role-management) discusses how roles are managed on multi-database nodes and new nodes.

* [PGD predefined roles](pgd-predefined-roles) details the specific privileges of the PGD roles.

* [Roles and replication](roles-and-replication) explains how PGD replication interacts with roles and privileges.

* [Access control](access-control) explains how tables, functions, catalog objects and triggers interact with PGD roles and Postgres attributes.
