title: Role management
---

Users are global objects in a PostgreSQL instance. `CREATE USER` and `CREATE
ROLE` commands are replicated automatically if they're executed in the database
where PGD is running and the
[`bdr.role_replication`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrrole_replication)
setting is turned on. 

## Roles for new nodes

When a new PGD node joins the PGD group, existing users aren't automatically
copied unless the node is added using [`bdr_init_physical`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes#bdr_init_physical). This behavior is
intentional and is an important security feature. PostgreSQL allows users to
access multiple databases, with the default being to access any database. PGD
doesn't know the access each user has to databases and so can't safely determine
the users to copy across to the new node.

PostgreSQL allows you to dump all users with the command:

```shell
pg_dumpall --roles-only > roles.sql
```

You can then edit the file `roles.sql` to remove unwanted users before
reexecuting that on the newly created node.

Other mechanisms are possible, depending on your identity and access
management solution (IAM) but aren't automated at this time.

## Connections and roles

When allocating a new PGD node, the user supplied in the DSN for the `local_dsn`
argument of [`bdr.create_node`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrcreate_node) and the `join_target_dsn` of [`bdr.join_node_group`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrjoin_node_group)
are used frequently to refer to, create, and manage database objects.

PGD is carefully written to prevent privilege escalation attacks even when using
a role with `SUPERUSER` rights in these DSNs.

To further reduce the attack surface, you can specify a more restricted user in
the above DSNs. At a minimum, such a user must be granted permissions on all
nodes, such that following stipulations are satisfied:

-   The user has the `REPLICATION` attribute.
-   It's granted the `CREATE` permission on the database.
-   It inherits the bdr_superuser role.
-   It owns all database objects to replicate, either directly or from
    permissions from the owner roles.

Once all nodes are joined, the permissions can be further reduced to just the
following to still allow DML and DDL replication:

-   The user has the `REPLICATION` attribute.
-   It inherits the bdr_superuser role.
