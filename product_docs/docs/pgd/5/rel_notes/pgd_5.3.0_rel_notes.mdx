## Highlights of EDB Postgres Distributed 5.3.0

* Postgres 16, PGE 16 and EPAS 16 supported

## Compatibility

!!! Note EDB Server version compatibility
This version requires the recently released Postgres versions 14.10, 15.4,
or 16.1 (or later) of EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended
Server. No such restrictions exist for PostgreSQL Server.

Package managers on Debian, RHEL, and SLES pull in the required EPAS or PGE
upgrades with an upgrade of Postgres Distributed.

## Bug Fixes

| Component | Version |Description  | Addresses |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Ensure that the WalSender process does not request locks on the partitions, thus avoiding a deadlock with user process waiting on sync commit. | RT97952 |
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Only consider CAMO transactions to be asynchronous when the CAMO setup was degraded to local mode. This solves the split brain problem when deciding fate of transactions that happened during failover. | RT78928 |
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Fix unsafe CAMO decisions in remote_write mode. ||
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Ensure that the taskmgr process does not ignore SIGINT. ||
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Speed up manager process startup by limiting the amount of WAL read for loading commit decisions. ||
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Clean up stale records in bdr.taskmgr_local_work_queue during physical join. ||
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Fix a bug in copying bdr.autopartition_rules during logical join. ||
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Override bdr.ddl_replication=off in taskmgr worker. ||
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Avoid a potential deadlock between `bdr.autopartition_wait_for_partitions()` and taskmgr||
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Fix writer missing updates in streaming mode with TDE enabled. ||
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Block new EPAS automatic partitioning on PGD cluster. ||
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Allow existing automatically partitioned tables when cluster is created or upgraded. ||
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Block PGD Autopartition on EPAS INTERVAL partitioned table. ||
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Ensure that replication does not break when bdr.autopartition() is invoked on a mixed version cluster, running with 3.7.23 and 4.3.3/5.3 ||
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Fix memory leak in LCR file TDE encryption. ||
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Fix memory leak in streaming transaction processing. ||
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Allow force parting of nodes that are already being parted normally. ||
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Fix nodes getting stuck on PART_CATCHUP due to replication slot conflict. ||
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Fix nodes getting stuck on PART_CATCHUP due to node_catchup_info conflict. ||
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Fix row filter failure for partitions created after a table column was dropped | RT95149 |
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Avoid aborting a group commit transaction on receiving the first abort response, the other nodes are given a chance to respond and transaction can succeed if the required responses are received ||
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Ensure that replication receiver worker reloads configuration correctly when `pg_reload_conf()` is called. ||
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Prevent duplicate Raft request ID generation which could break replication. ||
| BDR       | 5.3.0   | Fix several rare memory access issues that could potentially cause crashes of workers. ||
| CLI       | 5.3.0   | Fix `verify-settings` command if the `shared_preload_libraries` GUC contains file path ||
| CLI       | 5.3.0   | Show replslots status as `Critical` in `check-health` command when PGD cluster is reduced to a single node and it is a witness node | |
| Proxy     | 5.3.0   | Always set the server connection close behavior (setLinger(0)), earlier it was set only on client error | |
| Proxy     | 5.3.0   | Fix the logs fill up issue when all nodes are down in a PGD cluster | |
