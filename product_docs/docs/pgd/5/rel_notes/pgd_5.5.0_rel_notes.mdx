Released: 16 May 2024

EDB Postgres Distributed version 5.5.0 is a minor version of EDB Postgres Distributed.

!!! Important Recommended upgrade
We recommend that all users of PGD 5 upgrade to PGD 5.5. See [PGD/TPA upgrades](../upgrades/tpa_overview) for details.
!!!


## Highlights of EDB Postgres Distributed 5.5.0

Highlights of this 5.5.0 release include:

* Read scalability enhancements in PGD Proxy which allow [read-only queries to be routed](/pgd/5/routing/readonly/) to nodes that are members of a read-only pool. This feature can improve the overall performance of the PGD cluster.

## Compatibility

!!! Note EDB server version compatibility
This version requires the recently released Postgres versions 14.10, 15.4,
or 16.1 (or later) of EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended
Server. No such restrictions exist for Community Postgres Server.

Package managers on Debian, RHEL, and SLES pull in the required EDB Postgres
Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended upgrades with an upgrade of EDB
Postgres Distributed.
