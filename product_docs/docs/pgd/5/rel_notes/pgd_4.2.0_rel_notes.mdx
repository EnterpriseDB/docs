| --------- | ------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BDR       | 4.2.0   | Enhancement | Allow consumption of the reserved galloc sequence slot (BDR-2367, RT83437, RT68255) <p> The galloc sequence slot reserved for future use by background allocator can be consumed in the presence of consensus failure. </p>                                                 
| BDR       | 4.2.0   | Bug fix     | Fix spurious pglogical receiver timeouts on idle connections (RT82315) <p> When there is nothing to replicate and apply, the pglogical receiver may misinterpret the state as timeout and exit with error "ERROR:  08006: terminating pglogical receiver due to timeout". Correct this misinterpretation. </p>                                                               |
| BDR       | 4.2.0   | Bug fix     | Fix "insufficient privileges" error for non-superuser trusted extensions (BDR-2350) <p> A CREATE EXTENSION command executed by a non-superuser on PostgreSQL 13+ may succeed on the BDR node where it is executed but will fail to be replicated to other nodes breaking replication. Fix this by allowing such commands to be applied on non-origin nodes.</p>                |
| BDR       | 4.2.0   | Bug fix     | Avoid a race condition when reconstructing global_locks upon restart if Parallel Apply is enabled (RT83435, BDR-2383) <p> When parallel apply is enabled, multiple writers may try to recover the same global lock causing a deadlock. The BDR node where this happens will be rendered unrecoverable. Fix this by letting a single writer recover all the global locks. </p> |
| BDR       | 4.2.0   | Bug fix     | Fix spurious segmentation faults when conflicts are logged to bdr.conflict_history  (BDR-2403, RT83436, RT83928) <p>   When conflicts are logged to the catalog bdr.conflict_history, the pglogical writer process may crash because of a segmentation fault due to an invalid pointer being used. Fix this usage. </p>                                                          |
| BDR       | 4.2.0   | Bug fix     | Clean up the replication slot when bdr_init_physical fails (BDR-2364, RT74789) <p>   If bdr_init_physical aborts without being able to join the node, it will leave behind an inactive replication slot. Remove such a replication slot when it is inactive before an irregular exit. </p>                                                                                         |
| HARP       | 2.2.0   | Enhancement | Add support for sslpassword in a connection string, including processing hook (HNG-626)                                                                                     |
