| BDR       | 5.0.0   | Change  | Separate Task Management from Autopartition <p> In this release, the autopartition work queue mechanism has been moved to a separate module called Task Manager (taskmgr). The task manager is responsible for creating new tasks and executing the ones created by the local node or the task manager leader node. The autopartition worker is thus renamed as taskmgr worker process in this release.  </p> <p> In the older PGD releases, the Raft leader was responsible for creating new work items. But that creates a problem because a witness node can become a Raft leader while it does not have the full view of the cluster objects. In this release, we have introduced a concept of Task Manager Leader node. The node is selected automatically by PGD, but for upgraded clusters, its important to set the `node_kind` properly for all nodes in the cluster. The user is expected to this manually  after upgrading to the latest PGD version by calling bdr.alter_node_kind() SQL function for each node. </p> |
