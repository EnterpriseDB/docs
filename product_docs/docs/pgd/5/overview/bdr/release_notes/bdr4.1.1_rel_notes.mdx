title: "BDR 4.1.1"
---

This is a maintenance release of BDR 4 which includes new features as well
as fixes for issues identified in previous versions.


| Type | Category | Description |
| ---- | -------- | ----------- |
| Feature | User Experience | Add generic function bdr.is_node_connected returns true if the walsender for a given peer is active. |
| Feature | User Experience | Add generic function bdr.is_node_ready returns boolean if the lag is under a specific span. |
| Bug fix | User Experience | Add support for a `--link` argument to bdr_pg_upgrade for using hard-links. |
| Bug fix | User Experience | Prevent removing a `bdr.remove_commit_scope` if still referenced by any `bdr.node_group` as the default commit scope. |
| Bug fix | Reliability and operability | Correct Raft based switching to Local Mode for CAMO pairs of nodes (RT78928) |
| Bug fix | Reliability and operability | Prevent a potential segfault in bdr.drop_node for corner cases (RT81900) |
| Bug fix | User Experience | Prevent use of CAMO or Eager All Node transactions in combination with transaction streaming <br/> Transaction streaming turned out to be problematic in combination with CAMO and Eager All Node transactions. Until this is resolved, BDR now prevents its combined use. This may require CAMO deployments to adjust their configuration to disable transaction streaming, see [Transaction Streaming Configuration](../transaction-streaming#configuration).  |
