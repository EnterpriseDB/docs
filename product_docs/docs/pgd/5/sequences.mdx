title: Sequences


---

Many applications require that unique surrogate ids be assigned to database entries.
Often the database `SEQUENCE` object is used to produce these. In
PostgreSQL, these can be either:
-  A manually created sequence using the
`CREATE SEQUENCE` command and retrieved by calling the `nextval()` function
-  `serial` and `bigserial` columns or, alternatively,
`GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY` columns

However, standard sequences in PostgreSQL aren't multi-node aware and
produce values that are unique only on the local node. This is important because
unique ids generated by such sequences cause conflict and data loss (by
means of discarded `INSERT` actions) in multi-master replication.

## BDR global sequences

For this reason, BDR provides an application-transparent way to generate unique
ids using sequences on bigint or bigserial datatypes across the whole BDR group,
called *global sequences*.

BDR global sequences provide an easy way for applications to use the
database to generate unique synthetic keys in an asynchronous distributed
system that works for most&mdash;but not necessarily all&mdash;cases.

Using BDR global sequences allows you to avoid the problems with insert
conflicts. If you define a `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE` constraint on a column
that's using a global sequence, no node can ever get
the same value as any other node. When BDR synchronizes inserts between the
nodes, they can never conflict.

BDR global sequences extend PostgreSQL sequences, so they are crash-safe. To use
them, you must be granted the `bdr_application` role.

There are various possible algorithms for global sequences:

-   SnowflakeId sequences
-   Globally allocated range sequences

SnowflakeId sequences generate values using an algorithm that doesn't require
inter-node communication at any point. It's faster and more robust and has the 
useful property of recording the timestamp at which the values were
created.

SnowflakeId sequences have the restriction that they work only for 64-bit BIGINT
datatypes and produce values 19 digits long, which might be too long for
use in some host language datatypes such as Javascript Integer types.
Globally allocated sequences allocate a local range of values that can
be replenished as needed by inter-node consensus, making them suitable for
either BIGINT or INTEGER sequences.

You can create a global sequence using the `bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind()`
function. This function takes a standard PostgreSQL sequence and marks it as
a BDR global sequence. It can also convert the sequence back to the standard
PostgreSQL sequence.

BDR also provides the configuration variable `bdr.default_sequence_kind`, which
determines the kind of sequence to create when the `CREATE SEQUENCE`
command is executed or when a `serial`, `bigserial`, or
`GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY` column is created. Valid settings are:

-   `local`, meaning that newly created
    sequences are the standard PostgreSQL (local) sequences.
-   `galloc`, which always creates globally allocated range sequences.
-   `snowflakeid`, which creates global sequences for BIGINT sequences that
     consist of time, nodeid, and counter components. You can't use it with
     INTEGER sequences (so you can use it for `bigserial` but not for `serial`).
-   `timeshard`, which is the older version of SnowflakeId sequence and is provided for
    backward compatibility only. The SnowflakeId is preferred.
-   `distributed` (the default), which is a special value that you can use only for
     `bdr.default_sequence_kind`. It selects `snowflakeid` for `int8`
     sequences (i.e., `bigserial`) and `galloc` sequence for `int4`
     (i.e., `serial`) and `int2` sequences.

The `bdr.sequences` view shows information about individual sequence kinds.

`currval()` and `lastval()` work correctly for all types of global sequence.

### SnowflakeId sequences

The ids generated by SnowflakeId sequences are loosely time ordered so you can
use them to get the approximate order of data insertion, like standard PostgreSQL
sequences. Values generated within the same millisecond might be out of order,
even on one node. The property of loose time ordering means they are suitable
for use as range partition keys.

SnowflakeId sequences work on one or more nodes and don't require any inter-node
communication after the node join process completes. So you can continue to
use them even if there's the risk of extended network partitions. They aren't
affected by replication lag or inter-node latency.

SnowflakeId sequences generate unique ids in a different
way from standard sequences. The algorithm uses three components for a
sequence number. The first component of the sequence is a timestamp
at the time of sequence number generation. The second component of
the sequence number is the unique id assigned to each BDR node,
which ensures that the ids from different nodes are always different. 
The third component is the number generated by
the local sequence.

While adding a unique node id to the sequence number is enough
to ensure there are no conflicts, we also want to keep another useful
property of sequences. The ordering of the sequence
numbers roughly corresponds to the order in which data was inserted
into the table. Putting the timestamp first ensures this.

A few limitations and caveats apply to SnowflakeId sequences.

SnowflakeId sequences are 64 bits wide and need a `bigint` or `bigserial`.
Values generated are at least 19 digits long.
There's no practical 32-bit `integer` version, so you can't use it with `serial`
sequences. Use globally allocated range sequences instead.

For SnowflakeId there's a limit of 4096 sequence values generated per
millisecond on any given node (about 4 million sequence values per
second). In case the sequence value generation wraps around within a given
millisecond, the SnowflakeId sequence waits until the next millisecond and gets a
fresh value for that millisecond.

Since SnowflakeId sequences encode timestamps into the sequence value, you can generate new sequence
values only within the given time frame (depending on the system clock).
The oldest timestamp that you can use is 2016-10-07, which is the epoch time for
the SnowflakeId. The values wrap to negative values in the year 2086 and
completely run out of numbers by 2156.

Since timestamp is an important part of a SnowflakeId sequence, there's additional
protection from generating sequences with a timestamp older than the latest one
used in the lifetime of a postgres process (but not between postgres restarts).

The `INCREMENT` option on a sequence used as input for SnowflakeId sequences is
effectively ignored. This might be relevant for applications that do sequence
ID caching, like many object-relational mapper (ORM) tools, notably Hibernate.
Because the sequence is time based, this has little practical effect since the
sequence advances to a new noncolliding value by the time the
application can do anything with the cached values.

Similarly, you might change the `START`, `MINVALUE`, `MAXVALUE`, and `CACHE` settings
on the underlying sequence, but there's no benefit to doing
so. The sequence's low 14 bits are used and the rest is discarded, so
the value range limits don't affect the function's result. For the same
reason, `setval()` isn't useful for SnowflakeId sequences.

#### Timeshard sequences

Timeshard sequences are provided for backward compatibility with existing
installations but aren't recommended for new application use. We recommend
using the SnowflakeId sequence instead.

Timeshard is very similar to SnowflakeId but has different limits and fewer
protections and slower performance.

The differences between timeshard and SnowflakeId are as following:

 - Timeshard can generate up to 16384 per millisecond (about 16 million per
   second), which is more than SnowflakeId. However, there's no protection
   against wraparound within a given millisecond. Schemas using the timeshard
   sequence must protect the use of the `UNIQUE` constraint when using timeshard values
   for given column.
 - The timestamp component of timeshard sequence runs out of values in
   the year 2050 and, if used in combination with bigint, the values wrap
   to negative numbers in the year 2033. This means that sequences generated
   after 2033 have negative values. This is a considerably shorter time
   span than SnowflakeId and is the main reason why SnowflakeId is preferred.
 - Timeshard sequences require occasional disk writes (similar to standard local
   sequences). SnowflakeIds are calculated in memory so the SnowflakeId
   sequences are in general a little faster than timeshard sequences.

### Globally allocated range sequences

The globally allocated range (or `galloc`) sequences allocate ranges (chunks)
of values to each node. When the local range is used up, a new range is
allocated globally by consensus amongst the other nodes. This uses the key
space efficiently but requires that the local node be connected to a majority
of the nodes in the cluster for the sequence generator to progress when the
currently assigned local range is used up.

Unlike SnowflakeId sequences, `galloc` sequences support all sequence data types
provided by PostgreSQL: `smallint`, `integer`, and `bigint`. This means that
you can use `galloc` sequences in environments where 64-bit sequences are
problematic. Examples include using integers in javascript, since that supports only
53-bit values, or when the sequence is displayed on output with limited space.

The range assigned by each voting is currently predetermined based on the
datatype the sequence is using:

-   smallint &mdash; 1 000 numbers
-   integer &mdash; 1 000 000 numbers
-   bigint &mdash; 1 000 000 000 numbers

Each node allocates two chunks of seq_chunk_size, one for the current use
plus a reserved chunk for future usage, so the values generated from any one
node increase monotonically. However, viewed globally, the values
generated aren't ordered at all. This might cause a loss of performance
due to the effects on b-tree indexes and typically means that generated
values aren't useful as range partition keys.

The main downside of the `galloc` sequences is that once the assigned range is
used up, the sequence generator has to ask for consensus about the next range
for the local node that requires inter-node communication. This could
lead to delays or operational issues if the majority of the BDR group isn't
accessible. This might be avoided in later releases.

The `CACHE`, `START`, `MINVALUE`, and `MAXVALUE` options work correctly
with `galloc` sequences. However, you need to set them before transforming
the sequence to the `galloc` kind. The `INCREMENT BY` option also works
correctly. However, you can't assign an increment value that's equal
to or more than the above ranges assigned for each sequence datatype.
`setval()` doesn't reset the global state for `galloc` sequences; don't use it.

A few limitations apply to `galloc` sequences. BDR tracks `galloc` sequences in a
special BDR catalog [bdr.sequence_alloc](catalogs#bdrsequence_alloc). This
catalog is required to track the currently allocated chunks for the `galloc`
sequences. The sequence name and namespace is stored in this catalog. Since the
sequence chunk allocation is managed by Raft, whereas any changes to the
sequence name/namespace is managed by the replication stream, BDR currently doesn't
support renaming `galloc` sequences or moving them to another namespace or
renaming the namespace that contains a `galloc` sequence. Be
mindful of this limitation while designing application schema.

#### Converting a local sequence to a galloc sequence

Before transforming a local sequence to galloc, you need to take care of several
prerequisites.

##### 1. Verify that sequence and column data type match

Check that the sequence's data type matches the data type of the column with
which it will be used. For example, you can create a `bigint` sequence
and assign an `integer` column's default to the `nextval()` returned by that
sequence. With galloc sequences, which for `bigint` are allocated in blocks of
1 000 000 000, this quickly results in the values returned by `nextval()`
exceeding the `int4` range if more than two nodes are in use.

The following example shows what can happen:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE int8_seq;

SELECT sequencename, data_type FROM pg_sequences;
 sequencename | data_type
--------------+-----------
 int8_seq     | bigint
(1 row)

CREATE TABLE seqtest (id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY);

ALTER SEQUENCE int8_seq OWNED BY seqtest.id;

SELECT bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind('public.int8_seq'::regclass, 'galloc', 1);
 alter_sequence_set_kind
-------------------------

(1 row)

ALTER TABLE seqtest ALTER COLUMN id SET DEFAULT nextval('int8_seq'::regclass);
```

After executing `INSERT INTO seqtest VALUES(DEFAULT)` on two nodes, the table
contains the following values:

```sql
SELECT * FROM seqtest;
     id
------------
          2
 2000000002
(2 rows)
```

However, attempting the same operation on a third node fails with an
`integer out of range` error, as the sequence generated the value
`4000000002`. 

!!! Tip
    You can retrieve the current data type of a sequence from the PostgreSQL
    [pg_sequences](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-sequences.html)
    view. You can modify the data type of a sequence with `ALTER SEQUENCE ... AS ...`,
    for example, `ALTER SEQUENCE public.sequence AS integer`, as long as its current
    value doesn't exceed the maximum value of the new data type.

##### 2. Set a new start value for the sequence

When the sequence kind is altered to `galloc`, it's rewritten and restarts from
the defined start value of the local sequence. If this happens on an existing
sequence in a production database, you need to query the current value and
then set the start value appropriately. To assist with this use case, BDR
allows users to pass a starting value with the function `bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind()`.
If you're already using offset and you have writes from multiple nodes, you
need to check what is the greatest used value and restart the sequence at least
to the next value.

```sql
-- determine highest sequence value across all nodes
SELECT max((x->'response'->'command_tuples'->0->>'nextval')::bigint)
    FROM json_array_elements(
        bdr.run_on_all_nodes(
            E'SELECT nextval(\'public.sequence\');'
            )::jsonb AS x;

-- turn into a galloc sequence
SELECT bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind('public.sequence'::regclass, 'galloc', $MAX + $MARGIN);
```

Since users can't lock a sequence, you must leave a `$MARGIN` value to allow
operations to continue while the `max()` value is queried.

The `bdr.sequence_alloc` table gives information on the chunk size and the
ranges allocated around the whole cluster.
In this example, we started our sequence from `333`, and we have two nodes in the
cluster. We can see that we have a number of allocation 4, which is 2 per node,
and the chunk size is 1000000 that's related to an integer sequence.

```sql
SELECT * FROM bdr.sequence_alloc
    WHERE seqid = 'public.categories_category_seq'::regclass;
          seqid          | seq_chunk_size | seq_allocated_up_to | seq_nallocs |       seq_last_alloc
-------------------------+----------------+---------------------+-------------+-----------------------------
 categories_category_seq |        1000000 |             4000333 |           4 | 2020-05-21 20:02:15.957835+00
(1 row)
```

To see the ranges currently assigned to a given sequence on each node, use
these queries:

* Node `Node1` is using range from `333` to `2000333`.

```sql
SELECT last_value AS range_start, log_cnt AS range_end
    FROM categories_category_seq WHERE ctid = '(0,2)'; -- first range
 range_start | range_end
-------------+-----------
         334 |   1000333
(1 row)

SELECT last_value AS range_start, log_cnt AS range_end
    FROM categories_category_seq WHERE ctid = '(0,3)'; -- second range
 range_start | range_end
-------------+-----------
     1000334 |   2000333
(1 row)
```

* Node `Node2` is using range from `2000004` to `4000003`.

```sql
SELECT last_value AS range_start, log_cnt AS range_end
    FROM categories_category_seq WHERE ctid = '(0,2)'; -- first range
 range_start | range_end
-------------+-----------
     2000334 |   3000333
(1 row)

SELECT last_value AS range_start, log_cnt AS range_end
    FROM categories_category_seq WHERE ctid = '(0,3)'; -- second range
 range_start | range_end
-------------+-----------
     3000334 |   4000333
```

!!! NOTE 
    You can't combine it to a single query (like `WHERE ctid IN ('(0,2)', '(0,3)')`)
    as that still shows only the first range.

When a node finishes a chunk, it asks a consensus for a new one and gets the
first available. In the example, it's from 4000334 to 5000333. This is
the new reserved chunk and starts to consume the old reserved chunk.

## UUIDs, KSUUIDs, and other approaches

There are other ways to generate globally unique ids without using the global
sequences that can be used with BDR. For example:

-   UUIDs and their BDR variant, KSUUIDs
-   Local sequences with a different offset per node (i.e., manual)
-   An externally coordinated natural key

BDR applications can't use other methods safely:
counter-table-based approaches relying on `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`, `UPDATE ... RETURNING ...`
or similar for sequence generation doesn't work correctly in BDR because BDR
doesn't take row locks between nodes. The same values are generated on
more than one node. For the same reason, the usual strategies for "gapless"
sequence generation don't work with BDR. In most cases, the application
coordinates generation of sequences that must be gapless from some external
source using two-phase commit. Or it generates them only on one node in
the BDR group.

### UUIDs and KSUUIDs

`UUID` keys instead avoid sequences entirely and
use 128-bit universal unique identifiers. These are random
or pseudorandom values that are so large that it's nearly
impossible for the same value to be generated twice. There's
no need for nodes to have continuous communication when using `UUID` keys.

In the unlikely event of a collision, conflict detection
chooses the newer of the two inserted records to retain. Conflict logging,
if enabled, records such an event. However, it's
exceptionally unlikely to ever occur, since collisions
become practically likely only after about `2^64` keys are generated.

The main downside of `UUID` keys is that they're somewhat inefficient in terms of space and
the network. They consume more space not only as a primary key but
also where referenced in foreign keys and when transmitted on the wire.
Also, not all applications cope well with `UUID` keys.

BDR provides functions for working with a K-Sortable variant of `UUID` data,
known as KSUUID, which generates values that can be stored using the PostgreSQL
standard `UUID` data type. A `KSUUID` value is similar to `UUIDv1` in that
it stores both timestamp and random data, following the `UUID` standard.
The difference is that `KSUUID` is K-Sortable, meaning that it's weakly
sortable by timestamp. This makes it more useful as a database key as it
produces more compact `btree` indexes, which improves
the effectiveness of search, and allows natural time-sorting of result data.
Unlike `UUIDv1`,
`KSUUID` values don't include the MAC of the computer on which they were
generated, so there are no security concerns from using them.

`KSUUID` v2 is now recommended in all cases. You can directly sort values generated 
with regular comparison operators.

There are two versions of `KSUUID` in BDR: v1 and v2.
The legacy `KSUUID` v1 is
deprecated but is kept in order to support existing installations. Don't
use it for new installations.
The internal contents of v1 and v2 aren't compatible. As such, the
functions to manipulate them also aren't compatible. The v2 of `KSUUID` also
no longer stores the `UUID` version number.

### Step and offset sequences

In offset-step sequences, a normal PostgreSQL sequence is used on each node.
Each sequence increments by the same amount and starts at differing offsets.
For example, with step 1000, node1's sequence generates 1001, 2001, 3001, and
so on. node2's sequence generates 1002, 2002, 3002, and so on. This scheme works well
even if the nodes can't communicate for extended periods. However, the designer
must specify a maximum number of nodes when establishing the
schema, and it requires per-node configuration. Mistakes can easily lead to
overlapping sequences.

It's relatively simple to configure this approach with BDR by creating the
desired sequence on one node, like this:

```
CREATE TABLE some_table (
    generated_value bigint primary key
);

CREATE SEQUENCE some_seq INCREMENT 1000 OWNED BY some_table.generated_value;

ALTER TABLE some_table ALTER COLUMN generated_value SET DEFAULT nextval('some_seq');
```

Then, on each node calling `setval()`, give each node a different offset
starting value, for example:

```
-- On node 1
SELECT setval('some_seq', 1);

-- On node 2
SELECT setval('some_seq', 2);

 -- ... etc
```

Be sure to allow a large enough `INCREMENT` to leave room for all
the nodes you might ever want to add, since changing it in future is difficult
and disruptive.

If you use `bigint` values, there's no practical concern about key exhaustion,
even if you use offsets of 10000 or more. It would take hundreds of years,
with hundreds of machines, doing millions of inserts per second, to have any
chance of approaching exhaustion.

BDR doesn't currently offer any automation for configuration of the
per-node offsets on such step/offset sequences.

#### Composite keys

A variant on step/offset sequences is to use a composite key composed of
`PRIMARY KEY (node_number, generated_value)`, where the
node number is usually obtained from a function that returns a different
number on each node. You can create such a function by temporarily
disabling DDL replication and creating a constant SQL function. Alternatively, you can use
a one-row table that isn't part of a replication set to store a different
value in each node.

## Global sequence management interfaces

BDR provides an interface for converting between a standard PostgreSQL sequence
and the BDR global sequence.

The following functions are considered to be `DDL`, so DDL replication
and global locking applies to them.

### bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind

Allows the owner of a sequence to set the kind of a sequence.
Once set, `seqkind` is visible only by way of the `bdr.sequences` view.
In all other ways, the sequence appears as a normal sequence.

BDR treats this function as `DDL`, so DDL replication and global locking applies,
if it's currently active. See [DDL Replication](ddl).

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind(seqoid regclass, seqkind text)
```

#### Parameters

-   `seqoid` &mdash; Name or Oid of the sequence to alter.
-   `seqkind` &mdash; `local` for a standard PostgreSQL sequence, `snowflakeid` or
     `galloc` for globally unique BDR sequences, or `timeshard` for legacy
     globally unique sequence.

#### Notes

When changing the sequence kind to `galloc`, the first allocated range for that
sequence uses the sequence start value as the starting point. When there are
existing values that were used by the sequence before it was changed to `galloc`,
we recommend moving the starting point so that the newly generated
values don't conflict with the existing ones using the following command:

```sql
ALTER SEQUENCE seq_name START starting_value RESTART
```

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This means
that the replication is affected by the [ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration.

The function takes a global `DDL` lock. It also locks the sequence locally.

This function is transactional. You can roll back the effects with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction. The changes are visible to the current
transaction.

Only the owner of the sequence can execute the `bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind` function
unless `bdr.backwards_compatibility` is
set is set to 30618 or lower.
