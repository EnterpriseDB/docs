Learn about the PGD application from a user perspective.

## Application behavior

PGD supports replicating changes made on one node to other nodes.

PGD, by default, replicates all changes from INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE
and TRUNCATE operations from the source node to other nodes. Only the final changes
are sent, after all triggers and rules are processed. For example,
`INSERT ... ON CONFLICT UPDATE` sends either an insert or an update,
depending on what occurred on the origin. If an update or delete affects
zero rows, then no changes are sent.

You can replicate INSERT without any preconditions.

For updates and deletes to replicate on other nodes, PGD must be able to
identify the unique rows affected. PGD requires that a table have either
a PRIMARY KEY defined, a UNIQUE constraint, or an explicit REPLICA IDENTITY
defined on specific columns. If one of those isn't defined, a warning is
generated, and later updates or deletes are explicitly blocked.
If REPLICA IDENTITY FULL is defined for a table, then a unique index isn't required.
In that case, updates and deletes are allowed and use the first non-unique
index that's live, valid, not deferred, and doesn't have expressions or WHERE
clauses. Otherwise, a sequential scan is used.

You can use TRUNCATE even without a defined replication identity.
Replication of TRUNCATE commands is supported, but take care
when truncating groups of tables connected by foreign keys. When replicating
a truncate action, the subscriber truncates the same group of tables that
was truncated on the origin, either explicitly specified or implicitly
collected by CASCADE, except in cases where replication sets are defined.
See [Replication sets](repsets) for further details and examples.
This works correctly if all affected tables are part of the same
subscription. But if some tables to truncate on the subscriber have
foreign-key links to tables that aren't part of the same (or any)
replication set, then applying the truncate action on the
subscriber fails.

Row-level locks taken implicitly by INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands are
replicated as the changes are made.
Table-level locks taken implicitly by INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and TRUNCATE
commands are also replicated.
Explicit row-level locking (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE/FOR SHARE`) by user sessions
isn't replicated, nor are advisory locks. Information stored by transactions
running in SERIALIZABLE mode isn't replicated to other nodes. The
transaction isolation level of SERIALIAZABLE is supported, but transactions
aren't serialized across nodes in the presence of concurrent
transactions on multiple nodes.

If DML is executed on multiple nodes concurrently, then potential conflicts
might occur if executing with asynchronous replication. You must 
either handle these or avoid them. Various avoidance mechanisms are possible,
discussed in [Conflicts](consistency/conflicts).

Sequences need special handling, described in [Sequences](sequences).

Binary data in BYTEA columns is replicated normally, allowing "blobs" of data
up to 1 GB. Use of the PostgreSQL "large object" facility isn't
supported in PGD.

Rules execute only on the origin node so aren't executed during apply,
even if they're enabled for replicas.

Replication is possible only from base tables to base tables. That is, the
tables on the source and target on the subscription side must be
tables, not views, materialized views, or foreign tables. Attempts to
replicate tables other than base tables result in an error.
DML changes that are made through updatable views are resolved to
base tables on the origin and then applied to the same base table name on
the target.

PGD supports partitioned tables transparently, meaning that you can add a partitioned
table to a replication set and
changes that involve any of the partitions are replicated downstream.

By default, triggers execute only on the origin node. For example, an INSERT
trigger executes on the origin node and is ignored when you apply the change on
the target node. You can specify for triggers to execute on both the origin
node at execution time and on the target when it's replicated ("apply time")
by using `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ALWAYS TRIGGER`. Or, use the `REPLICA` option
to execute only at apply time: `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE REPLICA TRIGGER`.

Some types of trigger aren't executed on apply, even if they exist on a
table and are currently enabled. Trigger types not executed are:

-   Statement-level triggers (`FOR EACH STATEMENT`)
-   Per-column UPDATE triggers (`UPDATE OF column_name [, ...]`)

PGD replication apply uses the system-level default search_path. Replica
triggers, stream triggers, and index expression functions can assume
other search_path settings that then fail when they execute on apply.
To prevent this from occurring, use any of these techniques:

-  Resolve object references clearly using either only the default search_path. 
-  Always use fully qualified references to objects, e.g., schema.objectname. 
-  Set the search path for a function using `ALTER FUNCTION ... SET search_path = ...` for the functions affected.

PGD assumes that there are no issues related to text or other
collatable datatypes, i.e., all collations in use are available on all
nodes, and the default collation is the same on all nodes. Replicating
changes uses equality searches to locate Replica Identity values, so this
does't have any effect except where unique indexes are explicitly defined
with nonmatching collation qualifiers. Row filters might be affected
by differences in collations if collatable expressions were used.

PGD handling of very long "toasted" data in PostgreSQL is transparent to
the user. The TOAST "chunkid" values likely differ between
the same row on different nodes, but that doesn't cause any problems.

PGD can't work correctly if Replica Identity columns are marked as external.

PostgreSQL allows CHECK() constraints that contain volatile functions. Since
PGD re-executes CHECK() constraints on apply, any subsequent re-execution that
doesn't return the same result as before causes data divergence.

PGD doesn't restrict the use of foreign keys. Cascading FKs are allowed.

## Nonreplicated statements

None of the following user commands are replicated by PGD, so their effects
occur on the local/origin node only:

-   Cursor operations (DECLARE, CLOSE, FETCH)
-   Execution commands (DO, CALL, PREPARE, EXECUTE, EXPLAIN)
-   Session management (DEALLOCATE, DISCARD, LOAD)
-   Parameter commands (SET, SHOW)
-   Constraint manipulation (SET CONSTRAINTS)
-   Locking commands (LOCK)
-   Table maintenance commands (VACUUM, ANALYZE, CLUSTER, REINDEX)
-   Async operations (NOTIFY, LISTEN, UNLISTEN)

Since the `NOTIFY` SQL command and the `pg_notify()` functions
aren't replicated, notifications aren't reliable in case of failover.
This means that notifications can easily be lost at failover if a
transaction is committed just when the server crashes.
Applications running `LISTEN` might miss notifications in case of failover.

This is true in standard PostgreSQL replication, and PGD doesn't
yet improve on this. CAMO and Eager Replication options don't
allow the `NOTIFY` SQL command or the `pg_notify()` function.

## DML and DDL replication

PGD doesn't replicate the DML statement. It replicates the changes
caused by the DML statement. For example, an UPDATE that changed
two rows replicates two changes, whereas a DELETE that didn't
remove any rows doesn't replicate anything. This means that the results
of executing volatile statements are replicated, ensuring there's no
divergence between nodes as might occur with statement-based replication.

DDL replication works differently to DML. For DDL, PGD replicates the
statement, which then executes on all nodes. So a `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS`
might not replicate anything on the local node, but the statement is
still sent to other nodes for execution if DDL replication is enabled.
Full details are covered in [DDL replication](ddl).

PGD works to ensure that intermixed DML and DDL
statements work correctly, even in the same transaction.

## Replicating between different release levels

PGD is designed to replicate between nodes that have different major
versions of PostgreSQL. This feature is designed to allow major
version upgrades without downtime.

PGD is also designed to replicate between nodes that have different
versions of PGD software. This feature is designed to allow version
upgrades and maintenance without downtime.

However, while it's possible to join a node with a major version in
a cluster, you can't add a node with a minor version if the cluster
uses a newer protocol version. Doing so returns an error.

Both of these features might be affected by specific restrictions.
See [Release notes](/pgd/latest/rel_notes/) for any known incompatibilities.

## Replicating between nodes with differences

By default, DDL is automatically sent to all nodes. You can control this manually, as described in [DDL replication](ddl), and you can use it to create differences between database schemas across nodes.
PGD is designed to allow replication to continue even with minor
differences between nodes. These features are designed to allow
application schema migration without downtime or to allow logical
standby nodes for reporting or testing.

Currently, replication requires the same table name on all nodes. A future
feature might allow a mapping between different table names.

It's possible to replicate between tables with dissimilar partitioning
definitions, such as a source that's a normal table replicating to a
partitioned table, including support for updates that change partitions
on the target. It can be faster if the partitioning definition is the
same on the source and target since dynamic partition routing doesn't need to execute at apply time.
For details, see [Replication sets](repsets).

By default, all columns are replicated.

PGD replicates data columns based on the column name. If a column
has the same name but a different datatype, PGD attempt to cast from the source
type to the target type, if casts were defined that allow that.

PGD supports replicating between tables that have a different number of columns.

If the target has missing columns from the source, then PGD raises
a `target_column_missing` conflict, for which the default conflict resolver
is `ignore_if_null`. This throws an error if a non-NULL value arrives.
Alternatively, you can also configure a node with a conflict resolver of `ignore`.
This setting doesn't throw an error but silently ignores any additional
columns.

If the target has additional columns not seen in the source record, then PGD
raises a `source_column_missing` conflict, for which the default conflict resolver
is `use_default_value`. Replication proceeds if the additional columns
have a default, either NULL (if nullable) or a default expression. It
throws an error and halts replication if not.

Transform triggers can also be used on tables to provide default values
or alter the incoming data in various ways before apply.

If the source and the target have different constraints, then
replication is attempted, but it might fail if the rows from
source can't be applied to the target. Row filters can help here.

Replicating data from one schema to a more relaxed schema won't cause failures.
Replicating data from a schema to a more restrictive schema can be a source of
potential failures.
The right way to solve this is to place a constraint on the more relaxed side,
so bad data can't be entered. That way, no bad data ever arrives
by replication, so it never fails the transform into the more restrictive
schema. For example, if one schema has a column of type TEXT and another schema
defines the same column as XML, add a CHECK constraint onto the TEXT column
to enforce that the text is XML.

You can define a table with different indexes on each node. By default, the
index definitions are replicated. See [DDL replication](ddl) to
specify how to create an index on only a subset of nodes or just locally.

Storage parameters, such as `fillfactor` and `toast_tuple_target`, can differ
between nodes for a table without problems. An exception to that is that the
value of a table's storage parameter `user_catalog_table` must be identical
on all nodes.

A table being replicated must be owned by the same user/role on each node.
See [Security and roles](security) for further discussion.

Roles can have different passwords for connection on each node, although
by default changes to roles are replicated to each node. See
[DDL replication](ddl) to specify how to alter a role password on only a
subset of nodes or locally.

## Comparison between nodes with differences

LiveCompare is a tool for data comparison on a database, against PGD and
non-PGD nodes. It needs a minimum of two connections to compare against
and reach a final result.

Since LiveCompare 1.3, you can configure with `all_bdr_nodes` set. This setting
saves you from clarifying all the relevant DSNs for each separate node in the
cluster. An EDB Postgres Distributed cluster has N amount of nodes with connection information, but
it's only the initial and output connection that LiveCompare 1.3+ needs
to complete its job. Setting `logical_replication_mode` states how all the
nodes are communicating.

All the configuration is done in a `.ini` file named `bdrLC.ini`, for example.
Find templates for this configuration file in
`/etc/2ndq-livecompare/`.

While LiveCompare executes, you see N+1 progress bars, N being
the number of processes. Once all the tables are sourced, a time displays
as the transactions per second (tps) was measured. This continues to
count the time, giving you an estimate and then a total execution time at the end.

This tool offers a lot of customization and filters, such as tables, schemas, and
replication_sets. LiveCompare can use stop-start without losing context
information, so it can run at convenient times. After the comparison, a
summary and a DML script are generated so you can review it. Apply
the DML to fix any differences found.

## General rules for applications

PGD uses replica identity values to identify the rows to
change.
Applications can cause difficulties if they insert, delete, and then later
reuse the same unique identifiers.
This is known as the [ABA problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ABA_problem). PGD can't know whether the rows are the
current row, the last row, or much older rows.

Similarly, since PGD uses table names to identify the table against which
changes are replayed, a similar ABA problem exists with applications that
create, drop, and then later reuse the same object names.

These issues give rise to some simple rules for applications to follow:

-  Use unique identifiers for rows (INSERT).
-  Avoid modifying unique identifiers (UPDATE).
-  Avoid reusing deleted unique identifiers.
-  Avoid reusing dropped object names.

In the general case, breaking those rules can lead to data anomalies and
divergence. Applications can break those rules as long as certain conditions
are met, but use caution: while anomalies are unlikely, they aren't
impossible. For example, you can reuse a row value as long as the DELETE was replayed on all nodes, including down nodes. This might normally occur in
less than a second but can take days if a severe issue occurred
on one node that prevented it from restarting correctly.

## Timing considerations and synchronous replication

Being asynchronous by default, peer nodes might lag behind, making it
possible for a client connected to multiple PGD nodes or switching
between them to read stale data.

A [queue wait function](/pgd/latest/reference/functions/#bdrwait_for_apply_queue) is
provided for clients or proxies to prevent such stale reads.

The synchronous replication features of Postgres are available to PGD
as well. In addition, PGD provides multiple variants for more synchronous
replication. See
[Durability and performance options](durability) for an overview and comparison of all variants available and
its different modes.

## Application testing

You can test PGD applications using the following programs,
in addition to other techniques:

-   [Trusted Postgres Architect](#trusted-postgres-architect)
-   [pgbench with CAMO/Failover options](#pgbench-with-camofailover-options)
-   [isolationtester with multi-node access](#isolationtester-with-multi-node-access)

### Trusted Postgres Architect

[Trusted Postgres Architect](/tpa/latest) is the system used by EDB to
deploy reference architectures, including those based on EDB Postgres Distributed.

Trusted Postgres Architect includes test suites for each reference architecture.
It also simplifies creating and managing a local collection of tests to run
against a TPA cluster, using a syntax like the following:

```
tpaexec test mycluster mytest
```

We strongly recommend that developers write their own multi-node suite
of Trusted Postgres Architect tests that verify the main expected properties
of the application.

### pgbench with CAMO/failover options

In EDB Postgres Extended, the pgbench was extended to allow users to
run failover tests while using CAMO or regular PGD deployments. The following options were added:

```
-m, --mode=regular|camo|failover
mode in which pgbench should run (default: regular)

--retry
retry transactions on failover
```

In addition to these options, you must specify the connection information about the
peer node for failover in [DSN
form](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING).

-   Use `-m camo` or `-m failover` to specify the mode for pgbench.
    You can use The `-m failover` specification to test failover in
    regular PGD deployments.

-   Use `--retry` to specify whether to retry transactions when
    failover happens with `-m failover` mode. This option is enabled by default
    for `-m camo` mode.

Here's an example in a CAMO environment:

```sh
    pgbench -m camo -p $node1_port -h $node1_host bdrdemo \
        "host=$node2_host user=postgres port=$node2_port dbname=bdrdemo"
```

This command runs in CAMO mode. It connects to node1 and runs the tests. If the
connection to node1 is lost, then pgbench connects to
node2. It queries node2 to get the status of in-flight transactions.
Aborted and in-flight transactions are retried in camo mode.

In failover mode, if you specify `--retry`, then in-flight transactions are retried. In
this scenario there's no way to find the status of in-flight transactions.

### isolationtester with multi-node access

`isolationtester` was extended to allow users to run tests on multiple
sessions and on multiple nodes. This tool is used for internal PGD testing,
although it's also available for use with user application testing.

```
$ isolationtester \
     --outputdir=./iso_output \
     --create-role=logical \
     --dbname=postgres \
     --server 'd1=dbname=node1' \
     --server 'd2=dbname=node2' \
     --server 'd3=dbname=node3'
```

Isolation tests are a set of tests for examining concurrent behaviors in
PostgreSQL. These tests require running multiple interacting transactions,
which requires managing multiple concurrent connections and therefore
can't be tested using the normal `pg_regress` program. The name "isolation"
comes from the fact that the original motivation was to test the
serializable isolation level. Tests for other sorts of concurrent
behaviors were added as well.

It's built using PGXS as an external module.
On installation, it creates the `isolationtester` binary file, which is run by
`pg_isolation_regress` to perform concurrent regression tests and observe
results.

`pg_isolation_regress` is a tool similar to `pg_regress`, but instead of using
psql to execute a test, it uses isolationtester. It accepts all the same
command-line arguments as `pg_regress`. It was modified to accept multiple
hosts as parameters. It then passes the host conninfo along with server names
to the `isolationtester` binary. Isolation tester compares these server names with the
names specified in each session in the spec files and runs given tests on
respective servers.

To define tests with overlapping transactions, use test specification
files with a custom syntax. To add
a new test, place a spec file in the `specs/` subdirectory, add the expected
output in the `expected/` subdirectory, and add the test's name to the makefile.

Isolationtester is a program that uses libpq to open multiple connections
and executes a test specified by a spec file. A libpq connection string
specifies the server and database to connect to. Defaults derived from
environment variables are used otherwise.

Specification consists of five parts, tested in this order:

`server "<name>"`

  This part defines the name of the servers for the sessions to run on.
  There can be zero or more server `"<name>"` specifications.
  The conninfo corresponding to the names is provided by the command to
  run `isolationtester`. This is described in `quickstart_isolationtest.md`.
  This part is optional.

`setup { <SQL> }`

  The given SQL block is executed once, in one session only, before running
  the test. Create any test tables or other required objects here. This
  part is optional. Multiple setup blocks are allowed if needed. Each is
  run separately, in the given order. The reason for allowing multiple
  setup blocks is that each block is run as a single PQexec submission,
  and some statements such as VACUUM can't be combined with others in such
  a block.

`teardown { <SQL> }`

  The teardown SQL block is executed once after the test is finished. Use
  this part to clean up in preparation for the next permutation, such as dropping
  any test tables created by setup. This part is optional.

`session "<name>"`

  There are normally several "session" parts in a spec file. Each
  session is executed in its own connection. A session part consists
  of three parts: setup, teardown, and one or more "steps." The per-session
  setup and teardown parts have the same syntax as the per-test setup and
  teardown, but they are executed in each session. The
  setup part typically contains a BEGIN command to begin a transaction.

  A session part also consists of `connect_to` specification,
  which points to a server name specified in the beginning that
  indicates the server on which this session runs.

  `connect_to "<name>"`

  Each step has the syntax:

  `step "<name>" { <SQL> }`

  Where `<name>` is a name identifying this step, and SQL is a SQL statement
  (or statements, separated by semicolons) that's executed in the step.
  Step names must be unique across the whole spec file.

`permutation "<step name>"`

  A permutation line specifies a list of steps that are run in that order.
  Any number of permutation lines can appear. If no permutation lines are
  given, the test program automatically generates all possible orderings
  of the steps from each session (running the steps of any one session in
  order). The list of steps in a manually specified
  "permutation" line doesn't actually have to be a permutation of the
  available steps. It can, for instance, repeat some steps more than once
  or leave others out.

Lines beginning with # are comments.

For each permutation of the session steps (whether these are manually
specified in the spec file or automatically generated), the isolation
tester runs:

1. The main setup part
1. Per-session setup parts
1. The selected session steps
1. Per-session teardown
1. The main teardown script

Each selected step is sent to the connection associated
with its session.

To run isolation tests in a PGD environment that ran all prerequisite make
commands:

1.  Run `make isolationcheck-install` to install the isolationtester submodule.

2.  You can run isolation regression tests using either
    of the following commands from the bdr-private repo:

      `make isolationcheck-installcheck`
      `make isolationcheck-makecheck`

To run `isolationcheck-installcheck`, you need to have two or more postgresql
servers running. Pass the conninfo of each server to `pg_isolation_regress`
in the PGD makefile.
  Ex: `pg_isolation_regress --server 'd1=host=myhost dbname=mydb port=5434'
  --server 'd2=host=myhost1 dbname=mydb port=5432'`

Next, add a `.spec` file containing tests in the `specs/isolation` directory
of the `bdr-private/` repo. Add a `.out` file in the `expected/isolation` directory of
the `bdr-private/` repo.

Then run:

  `make isolationcheck-installcheck`

`Isolationcheck-makecheck` currently supports running isolation tests on a
single instance by setting up PGD between multiple databases.

You need to pass appropriate database names and the conninfo of bdr instances
to `pg_isolation_regress` in the PGD makefile as follows:
  `pg_isolation_regress --dbname=db1,db2 --server 'd1=dbname=db1'
  --server 'd2=dbname=db2'`

Then run:

  `make isolationcheck-makecheck`

Each step can contain commands that block until further action is taken.
Most likely, some other session runs a step that unblocks it or causes a
deadlock. A test that uses this ability must manually specify valid
permutations, that is, those that don't expect a blocked session to execute a
command. If a test doesn't follow that rule, `isolationtester` cancels it
after 300 seconds. If the cancel doesn't work, `isolationtester` exits
uncleanly after 375 seconds of wait time. Avoid testing invalid
permutations because they can make the isolation tests take
a very long time to run, and they serve no useful testing purpose.

`isolationtester` recognizes that a command has blocked by checking whether it's shown as waiting in the `pg_locks` view. Therefore, only
blocks on heavyweight locks are detected.

## Performance testing and tuning

PGD allows you to issue write transactions onto multiple master nodes.
Bringing those writes back together onto each node has a cost in
performance.

First, replaying changes from another node has a CPU cost, an I/O cost,
and it generates WAL records. The resource use is usually less
than in the original transaction since CPU overheads are lower as a result
of not needing to reexecute SQL. In the case of UPDATE and DELETE
transactions, there might be I/O costs on replay if data isn't cached.

Second, replaying changes holds table-level and row-level locks that can
produce contention against local workloads. The conflict-free replicated data types (CRDT) and column-level conflict detection (CLCD) features
ensure you get the correct answers even for concurrent updates, but they
don't remove the normal locking overheads. If you get locking contention,
try to avoid conflicting updates, or keep transactions as short as
possible. A heavily updated row in a larger transaction causes
a bottleneck on performance for that transaction. Complex applications
require some thought to maintain scalability.

If you think you're having performance problems,
develop performance tests using the benchmarking tools. pgbench
allows you to write custom test scripts specific to your use case
so you can understand the overheads of your SQL and measure the impact
of concurrent execution.

If PGD is running slow, then we suggest the following:

1.  Write a custom test script for pgbench, as close as you can make it
    to the production system's problem case.
2.  Run the script on one node to give you a baseline figure.
3.  Run the script on as many nodes as occurs in production, using the
    same number of sessions in total as you did on one node. This technique
    shows you the effect of moving to multiple nodes.
4.  Increase the number of sessions for these two tests so you can
    plot the effect of increased contention on your application.
5.  Make sure your tests are long enough to account for replication delays.
6.  Ensure that replication delay isn't growing during your tests.

Use all of the normal Postgres tuning features to improve the speed
of critical parts of your application.

## Use of table access methods (TAMs) in PGD

PGD 5.0 supports two table access methods released with EDB Postgres 15.0.
These two table access methods have been certified and allowed in PGD 5.0:

 * Auto cluster
 * Ref data

Any other TAM is restricted until certified by EDB.
If you are planning to use any of the table access method on a table,
you need to configure that TAM on each participating node in the
PGD cluster.
To configure auto cluster or ref data TAM, follow these steps on each node:
1.   Update `postgresql.conf` to specify TAMs `autocluster` or `refdata` for the
    `shared_preload_libraries` parameter.
1.   Restart the server and execute `CREATE EXTENSION autocluster;` or
    `CREATE EXTENSION refdata;`.

After you create the extension, you can use TAM to create a table using
`CREATE TABLE test USING autocluster;` or `CREATE TABLE test USING refdata;`.
This replicates to all the PGD nodes.
For more information on these table access methods, see [`CREATE TABLE`](/epas/latest/epas_compat_sql/36_create_table/).
