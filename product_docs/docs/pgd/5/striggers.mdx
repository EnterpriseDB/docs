PGD introduces new types of triggers that you can use for additional
data processing on the downstream/target node.

-   Conflict triggers
-   Transform triggers

Together, these types of triggers are known as *stream triggers*.

Stream triggers are designed to be trigger-like in syntax. They leverage the
PostgreSQL BEFORE trigger architecture and are likely to have similar
performance characteristics as PostgreSQL BEFORE Triggers.

Multiple trigger definitions can use one trigger function, just as with
normal PostgreSQL triggers.
A trigger function is a program defined in this form:
`CREATE FUNCTION ... RETURNS TRIGGER`. Creating the trigger doesn't
require use of the `CREATE TRIGGER` command. Instead, create stream triggers
using the special PGD functions
[`bdr.create_conflict_trigger()`](reference/streamtriggers/interfaces/#bdrcreate_conflict_trigger) and [`bdr.create_transform_trigger()`](reference/streamtriggers/interfaces/#bdrcreate_transform_trigger).

Once created, the trigger is visible in the catalog table `pg_trigger`.
The stream triggers are marked as `tgisinternal = true` and
`tgenabled = 'D'` and have the name suffix '\_bdrc' or '\_bdrt'. The view
`bdr.triggers` provides information on the triggers in relation to the table,
the name of the procedure that is being executed, the event that triggers it,
and the trigger type.

Stream triggers aren't enabled for normal SQL processing.
Because of this, the `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE TRIGGER` is blocked for stream
triggers in both its specific name variant and the ALL variant. This mechanism prevents
the trigger from executing as a normal SQL trigger.

These triggers execute on the downstream or target node. There's no
option for them to execute on the origin node. However, you might want to consider
the use of `row_filter` expressions on the origin.

Also, any DML that is applied while executing a stream
trigger isn't replicated to other PGD nodes and doesn't
trigger the execution of standard local triggers. This is intentional. You can use it, for example, 
to log changes or conflicts captured by a
stream trigger into a table that is crash-safe and specific of that
node. See [Stream triggers examples](#stream-triggers-examples) for a working example.

## Trigger execution during Apply

Transform triggers execute first&mdash;once for each incoming change in the
triggering table. These triggers fire before we attempt to locate a
matching target row, allowing a very wide range of transforms to be applied
efficiently and consistently.

Next, for UPDATE and DELETE changes, we locate the target row. If there's no
target row, then no further processing occurs for those change types.

We then execute any normal triggers that previously were explicitly enabled
as replica triggers at table-level:

```sql
ALTER TABLE tablename
ENABLE REPLICA TRIGGER trigger_name;
```

We then decide whether a potential conflict exists. If so, we then call any
conflict trigger that exists for that table.

### Missing column conflict resolution

Before transform triggers are executed, PostgreSQL tries to match the
incoming tuple against the row-type of the target table.

Any column that exists on the input row but not on the target table 
triggers a conflict of type `target_column_missing`. Conversely, a
column existing on the target table but not in the incoming row
triggers a `source_column_missing` conflict. The default resolutions
for those two conflict types are respectively `ignore_if_null` and
`use_default_value`.

This is relevant in the context of rolling schema upgrades, for
example, if the new version of the schema introduces a new
column. When replicating from an old version of the schema to a new
one, the source column is missing, and the `use_default_value`
strategy is appropriate, as it populates the newly introduced column
with the default value.

However, when replicating from a node having the new schema version to
a node having the old one, the column is missing from the target
table. The `ignore_if_null` resolver isn't appropriate for a
rolling upgrade because it breaks replication as soon as the user
inserts a tuple with a non-NULL value
in the new column in any of the upgraded nodes.

In view of this example, the appropriate setting for rolling schema
upgrades is to configure each node to apply the `ignore` resolver in
case of a `target_column_missing` conflict.

You can do this with the following query, which you must execute
separately on each node. Replace `node1` with the actual
node name.

```sql
SELECT bdr.alter_node_set_conflict_resolver('node1',
    'target_column_missing', 'ignore');
```

#### Data loss and divergence risk

Setting the conflict resolver to `ignore`
can lead to data loss and cluster divergence.

Consider the following example: table `t` exists on nodes 1 and 2, but
its column `col` exists only on node 1.

If the conflict resolver is set to `ignore`, then there can be rows on
node 1 where `c` isn't null, for example, `(pk=1, col=100)`. That row is
replicated to node 2, and the value in column `c` is discarded,
for example, `(pk=1)`.

If column `c` is then added to the table on node 2, it is at first
set to NULL on all existing rows, and the row considered above
becomes `(pk=1, col=NULL)`. The row having `pk=1` is no longer
identical on all nodes, and the cluster is therefore divergent.

The default `ignore_if_null` resolver isn't affected by
this risk because any row replicated to node 2 has
`col=NULL`.

Based on this example, we recommend running LiveCompare against the
whole cluster at the end of a rolling schema upgrade where the
`ignore` resolver was used. This practice helps to ensure that you detect and fix any divergence.

## Terminology of row-types

We use these row-types:

-   `SOURCE_OLD` is the row before update, that is, the key.
-   `SOURCE_NEW` is the new row coming from another node.
-   `TARGET` is the row that exists on the node already, that is, the conflicting row.

## Conflict triggers

Conflict triggers execute when a conflict is detected by PGD.
They decide what happens when the conflict has occurred.

-   If the trigger function returns a row, the action is applied to the target.
-   If the trigger function returns a NULL row, the action is skipped.

For example, if the trigger is called for a `DELETE`, the trigger
returns NULL if it wants to skip the `DELETE`. If you want the `DELETE` to proceed,
then return a row value: either `SOURCE_OLD` or `TARGET` works.
When the conflicting operation is either `INSERT` or `UPDATE`, and the
chosen resolution is the deletion of the conflicting row, the trigger
must explicitly perform the deletion and return NULL.
The trigger function can perform other SQL actions as it chooses, but
those actions are only applied locally, not replicated.

When a real data conflict occurs between two or more nodes,
two or more concurrent changes are occurring. When we apply those changes, the
conflict resolution occurs independently on each node. This means the conflict
resolution occurs once on each node and can occur with a
significant time difference between them. As a result, communication between the multiple executions of the conflict
trigger isn't possible. It is the responsibility of the author of the conflict trigger to
ensure that the trigger gives exactly the same result for all related events.
Otherwise, data divergence occurs. Technical Support recommends that you formally test all conflict
triggers using the isolationtester tool supplied with
PGD.

!!! Warning
    -   You can specify multiple conflict triggers on a single table, but
        they must match a distinct event. That is, each conflict must
        match only a single conflict trigger.
    -   We don't recommend multiple triggers matching the same event on the same table.
        They might result in inconsistent behavior and
        will not be allowed in a future release.

If the same conflict trigger matches more than one event, you can use the `TG_OP`
variable in the trigger to identify the operation that
produced the conflict.

By default, PGD detects conflicts by observing a change of replication origin
for a row. Hence, you can call a conflict trigger even when 
only one change is occurring. Since, in this case, there's no
real conflict, this conflict detection mechanism can generate
false-positive conflicts. The conflict trigger must handle all of those
identically.

In some cases, timestamp conflict detection doesn't detect a
conflict at all. For example, in a concurrent `UPDATE`/`DELETE` where the
`DELETE` occurs just after the `UPDATE`, any nodes that see first the `UPDATE`
and then the `DELETE` don't see any conflict. If no conflict is seen,
the conflict trigger are never called. In the same situation but using
row version conflict detection, a conflict is seen, which a conflict trigger can then 
handle.

The trigger function has access to additional state information as well as
the data row involved in the conflict, depending on the operation type:

-   On `INSERT`, conflict triggers can access the `SOURCE_NEW` row from
    the source and `TARGET` row.
-   On `UPDATE`, conflict triggers can access the `SOURCE_OLD` and
    `SOURCE_NEW` row from the source and `TARGET` row.
-   On `DELETE`, conflict triggers can access the `SOURCE_OLD` row from
    the source and `TARGET` row.

You can use the function `bdr.trigger_get_row()` to retrieve `SOURCE_OLD`, `SOURCE_NEW`,
or `TARGET` rows, if a value exists for that operation.

Changes to conflict triggers happen transactionally and are protected by
global DML locks during replication of the configuration change, similarly
to how some variants of `ALTER TABLE` are handled.

If primary keys are updated inside a conflict trigger, it can
sometimes lead to unique constraint violations errors due to a difference
in timing of execution.
Hence, avoid updating primary keys in conflict triggers.

## Transform triggers

These triggers are similar to conflict triggers, except they are executed
for every row on the data stream against the specific table. The behavior of
return values and the exposed variables is similar, but transform triggers
execute before a target row is identified, so there is no `TARGET` row.

You can specify multiple transform triggers on each table in PGD.
Transform triggers execute in alphabetical order.

A transform trigger can filter away rows, and it can do additional operations
as needed. It can alter the values of any column or set them to `NULL`. The
return value decides the further action taken:

-   If the trigger function returns a row, it's applied to the target.
-   If the trigger function returns a `NULL` row, there's no further action to
    perform. Unexecuted triggers never execute.
-   The trigger function can perform other actions as it chooses.

The trigger function has access to additional state information as well as
rows involved in the conflict:

-   On `INSERT`, transform triggers can access the `SOURCE_NEW` row from the source.
-   On `UPDATE`, transform triggers can access the `SOURCE_OLD` and `SOURCE_NEW` row from the source.
-   On `DELETE`, transform triggers can access the `SOURCE_OLD` row from the source.

You can use the function `bdr.trigger_get_row()` to retrieve `SOURCE_OLD` or `SOURCE_NEW`
rows. `TARGET` row isn't available, since this type of trigger executes before such
a target row is identified, if any.

Transform triggers look very similar to normal BEFORE row triggers but have these
important differences:

-   A transform trigger gets called for every incoming change.
    BEFORE triggers aren't called at all for `UPDATE` and `DELETE` changes
    if a matching row in a table isn't found.

-   Transform triggers are called before partition table routing occurs.

-   Transform triggers have access to the lookup key via `SOURCE_OLD`,
    which isn't available to normal SQL triggers.

## Row contents

The `SOURCE_NEW`, `SOURCE_OLD`, and `TARGET` contents depend on the operation, REPLICA
IDENTITY setting of a table, and the contents of the target table.

The TARGET row is available only in conflict triggers. The TARGET row
contains data only if a row was found when applying `UPDATE` or `DELETE` in the target
table. If the row isn't found, the TARGET is `NULL`.

## Execution order

Execution order for triggers:

-   Transform triggers &mdash; Execute once for each incoming row on the target.
-   Normal triggers &mdash; Execute once per row.
-   Conflict triggers &mdash; Execute once per row where a conflict exists.

## Stream triggers examples

A conflict trigger that provides similar behavior as the `update_if_newer`
conflict resolver:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_if_newer_trig_func
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
BEGIN
    IF (bdr.trigger_get_committs('TARGET') >
        bdr.trigger_get_committs('SOURCE_NEW')) THEN
    RETURN TARGET;
    ELSIF
        RETURN SOURCE;
    END IF;
END;
$$;
```

A conflict trigger that applies a delta change on a counter column and uses
SOURCE_NEW for all other columns:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION delta_count_trg_func
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    DELTA bigint;
    SOURCE_OLD record;
    SOURCE_NEW record;
    TARGET record;
BEGIN
    SOURCE_OLD := bdr.trigger_get_row('SOURCE_OLD');
    SOURCE_NEW := bdr.trigger_get_row('SOURCE_NEW');
    TARGET := bdr.trigger_get_row('TARGET');

    DELTA := SOURCE_NEW.counter - SOURCE_OLD.counter;
    SOURCE_NEW.counter = TARGET.counter + DELTA;

    RETURN SOURCE_NEW;
END;
$$;
```

A transform trigger that logs all changes to a log table instead of applying them:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION log_change
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
    SOURCE_NEW record;
    SOURCE_OLD record;
    COMMITTS timestamptz;
BEGIN
    SOURCE_NEW := bdr.trigger_get_row('SOURCE_NEW');
    SOURCE_OLD := bdr.trigger_get_row('SOURCE_OLD');
    COMMITTS := bdr.trigger_get_committs('SOURCE_NEW');

    IF (TG_OP = 'INSERT') THEN
        INSERT INTO log SELECT 'I', COMMITTS, row_to_json(SOURCE_NEW);
    ELSIF (TG_OP = 'UPDATE') THEN
        INSERT INTO log SELECT 'U', COMMITTS, row_to_json(SOURCE_NEW);
    ELSIF (TG_OP = 'DELETE') THEN
        INSERT INTO log SELECT 'D', COMMITTS, row_to_json(SOURCE_OLD);
    END IF;

    RETURN NULL; -- do not apply the change
END;
$$;
```

This example shows a conflict trigger that implements trusted source
conflict detection, also known as trusted site, preferred node, or Always Wins
resolution. This uses the `bdr.trigger_get_origin_node_id()` function to provide
a solution that works with three or more nodes.

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION test_conflict_trigger()
RETURNS TRIGGER
LANGUAGE plpgsql
AS $$
DECLARE
	SOURCE	record;
	TARGET	record;

	TRUSTED_NODE	bigint;
	SOURCE_NODE		bigint;
	TARGET_NODE		bigint;
BEGIN
	TARGET := bdr.trigger_get_row('TARGET');
	IF (TG_OP = 'DELETE')
		SOURCE := bdr.trigger_get_row('SOURCE_OLD');
	ELSE
		SOURCE := bdr.trigger_get_row('SOURCE_NEW');
	END IF;

	TRUSTED_NODE := current_setting('customer.trusted_node_id');

	SOURCE_NODE := bdr.trigger_get_origin_node_id('SOURCE_NEW');
	TARGET_NODE := bdr.trigger_get_origin_node_id('TARGET');

	IF (TRUSTED_NODE = SOURCE_NODE) THEN
		RETURN SOURCE;
	ELSIF (TRUSTED_NODE = TARGET_NODE) THEN
		RETURN TARGET;
	ELSE
		RETURN NULL; -- do not apply the change
	END IF;
END;
$$;
```
