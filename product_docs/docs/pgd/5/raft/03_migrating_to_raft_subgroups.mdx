title: Migrating to Raft subgroups
---

This section assumes that you have an already running cluster and wish to introduce Raft subgroups to your cluster.


## Migrating to Raft subgroups (without TPA)

A number of configuration steps need to be taken to enable Raft subgroups to an existing cluster.

* The “top-level” group needs to be identified for all nodes in the PGD cluster. If you have an existing cluster, you should already have a "top-level" group that all nodes belong to.
* A subgroup needs to be created for each location. Use `bdr_create_node_group`
* Each location’s subgroup should be added to the “top-level” group. Use `bdr.join_node_group()`, `bdr.switch_node_group()` or bdr.alter_node_group().
* Each node at each location should be added to their location’s subgroup. Use bdr.join_node_group(), bdr.switch_node_group() or bdr.alter_node_group().
* Each of the location’s subgroups should be altered to enable Raft for the location. Use `bdr.alter_node_group_option()` setting the `enable_raft` option to true.

#### How to enable subgroup Raft node group:

```sql
SELECT bdr.alter_node_group_option('$group_name', 'enable_raft', 'true');
```
