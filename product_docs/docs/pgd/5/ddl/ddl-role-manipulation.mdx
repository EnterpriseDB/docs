title: DDL and role manipulation statements
navTitle: Roles
---

Users are global objects in a PostgreSQL instance, which means they span
multiple databases while PGD operates on an individual database level. Because of this behavior,
role manipulation statement handling needs extra thought.

PGD requires that any roles that are referenced by any replicated DDL must
exist on all nodes. The roles don't have to have the same grants,
password, and so on, but they must exist.

PGD replicates role manipulation statements if [`bdr.role_replication`](/pgd/5/reference/pgd-settings#bdrrole_replication) is
enabled (default) and role manipulation statements are run in a PGD-enabled
database.


The role manipulation statements include the following:

-   `CREATE ROLE`
-   `ALTER ROLE`
-   `DROP ROLE`
-   `GRANT ROLE`
-   `CREATE USER`
-   `ALTER USER`
-   `DROP USER`
-   `CREATE GROUP`
-   `ALTER GROUP`
-   `DROP GROUP`

In general, either:

-   Configure the system with `bdr.role_replication = off`, and
    deploy all role changes (user and group) by external orchestration
    tools like Ansible, Puppet, and Chef or explicitly replicated by
    `bdr.replicate_ddl_command()`.

-   Configure the system so that exactly one PGD-enabled database
    on the PostgreSQL instance has `bdr.role_replication = on`, and run all
    role management DDL on that database.

We recommended that you run all role management commands in one
database.

If role replication is turned off, then the administrator must ensure that
any roles used by DDL on one node also exist on the other nodes. Otherwise PGD apply
stalls with an error until the role is created on the other nodes.

!!! Note PGD with non-PGD-enabled databases 
    PGD doesn't capture and replicate role management statements when they
    run on a non-PGD-enabled database in a PGD-enabled PostgreSQL instance.
    For example, suppose you have databases `bdrdb` (bdr group member) and `postgres` (bare db),
    and `bdr.role_replication = on`. A `CREATE USER` run in `bdrdb` is
    replicated, but a `CREATE USER` run in `postgres` isn't.
