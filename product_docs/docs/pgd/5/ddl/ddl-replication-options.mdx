The [`bdr.ddl_replication`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrddl_replication) parameter specifies replication behavior.

`bdr.ddl_replication = all` is the default. This setting replicates DDL to the
default replication set, which by default means all nodes. Nondefault
replication sets don't replicate DDL unless they have a
[DDL filter](../repsets)
defined for them.

You can also replicate DDL to specific replication sets using the
function [`bdr.replicate_ddl_command()`](/pgd/latest/reference/functions#bdrreplicate_ddl_command). This function can be helpful if you
want to run DDL commands when a node is down. It's also helpful if you want to have
indexes or partitions that exist on a subset of nodes or rep sets,
for example, all nodes at site1.


```
SELECT bdr.replicate_ddl_command(
				'CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY ON foo (col7);',
				ARRAY['site1'],     -- the replication sets
                'all');              -- ddl_locking to apply
```

While we don't recommend it, you can skip automatic DDL replication and
execute it manually on each node using the [`bdr.ddl_replication`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrddl_replication) configuration
parameter.

```
SET bdr.ddl_replication = off;
```

When set, it makes PGD skip both the global locking and the replication
of executed DDL commands. You must then run the DDL manually on all nodes.

!!! Warning
    Executing DDL manually on each node without global locking can
    cause the whole PGD group to stop replicating if conflicting DDL or DML
    executes concurrently.

Only only the bdr_superuser or superuser can set the `bdr.ddl_replication` parameter can be set. Or, you can set it in the `postgres.conf` configuration file.
