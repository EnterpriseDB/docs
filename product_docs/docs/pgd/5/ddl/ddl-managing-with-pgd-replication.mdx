## Minimizing the impact of DDL

Minimizing the impact of DDL is good operational advice for any database. These points become even more
important with PGD:

-   To minimize the impact of DDL, make transactions performing DDL short.
    Don't combine them with lots of row changes, and avoid long-running 
    foreign key or other constraint rechecks.

-   For `ALTER TABLE`, use `ADD CONSTRAINT NOT VALID` followed by another
    transaction with `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` rather than using `ADD CONSTRAINT` alone.
    `VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` waits until replayed on all nodes, which
    gives a noticeable delay to receive confirmations.

-   When indexing, use the `CONCURRENTLY` option whenever possible.

An alternative way of executing long-running DDL is to disable DDL replication
and then to execute the DDL statement separately on each node. You can 
still do this using a single SQL statement, as shown in the following example.
Global locking rules still apply, so be careful not to lock
yourself out with this type of usage, which is more of a
workaround.

```sql
SELECT bdr.run_on_all_nodes($ddl$
        CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY index_a ON table_a(i);
$ddl$);
```

We recommend using the [`bdr.run_on_all_nodes()`](/pgd/latest/reference/functions#bdrrun_on_all_nodes) technique with `CREATE
INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, noting that DDL replication must be disabled for the whole
session because `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` is a multi-transaction command.
Avoid `CREATE INDEX` on production systems
since it prevents writes while it executes.
`REINDEX` is replicated in versions 3.6 and earlier but not with PGD 3.7 or later.
Avoid using `REINDEX` because of the AccessExclusiveLocks it holds.

Instead, use `REINDEX CONCURRENTLY` (or `reindexdb --concurrently`),
which is available in PG12+ or 2QPG11+.

You can disable DDL replication when using command-line utilities like this:

```sql
$ export PGOPTIONS="-c bdr.ddl_replication=off"
$ pg_restore --section=post-data
```

Multiple DDL statements might benefit from bunching into a single transaction
rather than fired as individual statements, so take the DDL lock 
only once. This might not be desirable if the table-level locks interfere with
normal operations.

If DDL is holding up the system for too long, you can safely
cancel the DDL on the originating node with **Control-C** in psql or with `pg_cancel_backend()`.
You can't cancel a DDL lock from any other node.

You can control how long the global lock takes with optional global locking
timeout settings. [`bdr.global_lock_timeout`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrglobal_lock_timeout) limits how long the wait for
acquiring the global lock can take before it's canceled.
[`bdr.global_lock_statement_timeout`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrglobal_lock_statement_timeout) limits the runtime length of any statement
in transaction that holds global locks, and [`bdr.global_lock_idle_timeout`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrglobal_lock_idle_timeout) sets
the maximum allowed idle time (time between statements) for a transaction
holding any global locks. You can disable all of these timeouts by setting their
values to zero.

Once the DDL operation has committed on the originating node, you can't cancel or abort it. 
The PGD group must wait for it to apply successfully on
other nodes that confirmed the global lock and for them to acknowledge replay.
For this reason, keep DDL transactions short and fast.

## Handling DDL with down nodes

If the node initiating the global DDL lock goes down after it acquired
the global lock (either DDL or DML), the lock stays active.
The global locks don't time out, even if timeouts were set.
In case the node comes back up, it releases all the global
locks that it holds.

If it stays down for a long time or indefinitely,
remove the node from the PGD group to release the global locks. This
is one reason for executing emergency DDL using the `SET` command as
the bdr_superuser to update the [`bdr.ddl_locking`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrddl_locking) value.

If one of the other nodes goes down after it confirmed the global lock
but before the command acquiring it executed, the execution of
that command requesting the lock continues as if the node were up.

As mentioned earlier, the global DDL lock requires only a majority of
the nodes to respond, and so it works if part of the cluster is down, as long as a
majority is running and reachable. But the DML lock can't be acquired
unless the whole cluster is available.

With global DDL or global DML lock, if another node goes down, the
command continues normally, and the lock is released.

## Statement-specific DDL replication concerns

Not all commands can be replicated automatically. Such commands
are generally disallowed, unless DDL replication is turned off
by turning [`bdr.ddl_replication`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrddl_replication) off.

PGD prevents some DDL statements from running when it's active on a
database. This protects the consistency of the system by disallowing
statements that can't be replicated correctly or for which replication
isn't yet supported.

If a statement isn't permitted under PGD, you can often find
another way to do the same thing. For example, you can't do an `ALTER TABLE`,
which adds a column with a volatile default value. But generally you can
rephrase that as a series of independent `ALTER TABLE` and `UPDATE` statements
that work.

Generally, unsupported statements are prevented from 
executing, raising a `feature_not_supported` (SQLSTATE `0A000`) error.

Any DDL that references or relies on a temporary object can't
be replicated by PGD and throws an error if executed with DDL replication
enabled.
