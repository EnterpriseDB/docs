DDL stands for data definition language, the subset of the SQL
language that creates, alters, and drops database objects.

It requires careful handling in a replicated system like PGD.

This section looks at how DDL replication is handled in PGD.

* [Overview](ddl-overview) provides a general outline of what PGD's DDL replication is capable of.

* [Replication Options](ddl-replication-options) looks at the options for controlling replication.

* [Locking](ddl-locking) examines how DDL replication uses locks to safely replicate DDL.

* [Managing DDL with PGD replication](ddl-managing-with-pgd-replication) give best practice advice on why and how to limit the impact of DDL changes so they do not overly affect the smooth running of the cluster.

* [Command Handling](ddl-command-handling) is a reference to all DDL commands, what locks they take and any special handling that may be involved in their use and execution.

* [DDL role manipulation](ddl-role-manipulation) notes issues around manipulating roles over multiple databases in a cluster

* [Workarounds](ddl-workarounds) gives a range of options for handling situations where DDL replication may present restrictions, such as altering columns, constraints and types.

* [DDL-like PGD functions](ddl-pgd-functions-like-ddl) details the PGD functions which behave like DDL and therefore behave in a similar way and are subject to similar restrictions.
