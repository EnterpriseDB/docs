You can test PGD applications using the following approaches:

-   [Trusted Postgres Architect](#trusted-postgres-architect)
-   [pgd_bench with CAMO/failover options](#pgd_bench)


### Trusted Postgres Architect

[Trusted Postgres Architect](/tpa/latest) is the system used by EDB to
deploy reference architectures, including those based on EDB Postgres Distributed.

Trusted Postgres Architect includes test suites for each reference architecture.
It also simplifies creating and managing a local collection of tests to run
against a TPA cluster, using a syntax like the following:

```
tpaexec test mycluster mytest
```

We strongly recommend that developers write their own multi-node suite
of Trusted Postgres Architect tests that verify the main expected properties
of the application.

### pgd_bench

The Postgres benchmarking application
[`pgbench`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgbench.html) was
extended in PGD 5.0 in the form of a new application: pgd_bench.

[pgd_bench](/pgd/5/reference/testingandtuning#pgd_bench) is a regular command-line utility that's added to the PostgreSQL bin
directory. The utility is based on the PostgreSQL pgbench tool but
supports benchmarking CAMO transactions and PGD-specific workloads.

Functionality of pgd_bench is a superset of pgbench functionality but
requires the BDR extension to be installed to work properly.

Key differences include:

-   Adjustments to the initialization (`-i` flag) with the standard 
    pgbench scenario to prevent global lock timeouts in certain cases.
-   `VACUUM` command in the standard scenario is executed on all nodes.
-   pgd_bench releases are tied to the releases of the BDR extension
    and are built against the corresponding Postgres distribution. This information is
    reflected in the output of the `--version` flag.

The current version allows you to run failover tests while using CAMO or
regular PGD deployments. 

The following options were added:

```
-m, --mode=regular|camo|failover
mode in which pgbench should run (default: regular)
```

-   Use `-m camo` or `-m failover` to specify the mode for pgd_bench.
    You can use the `-m failover` specification to test failover in
    regular PGD deployments.

```
--retry
retry transactions on failover
```

-   Use `--retry` to specify whether to retry transactions when
    failover happens with `-m failover` mode. This option is enabled by default
    for `-m camo` mode.

In addition to these options, you must specify the connection information about
the peer node for failover in [DSN
form](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING).

Here's an example in a CAMO environment:

```sh
    pgd_bench -m camo -p $node1_port -h $node1_host bdrdemo \
        "host=$node2_host user=postgres port=$node2_port dbname=bdrdemo"
```

This command runs in CAMO mode. It connects to node1 and runs the tests. If the
connection to node1 is lost, then pgd_bench connects to node2. It queries node2
to get the status of in-flight transactions. Aborted and in-flight transactions
are retried in CAMO mode.

In failover mode, if you specify `--retry`, then in-flight transactions are
retried. In this scenario, there's no way to find the status of in-flight
transactions.

### Notes on pgd_bench usage

-   When using custom init-scripts, it's important to understand implications behind the DDL commands.
We generally recommend waiting for the secondary nodes to catch up on the data-load steps
before proceeding with DDL operations such as `CREATE INDEX`. The latter acquire global locks that
can't be acquired until the data load is complete and thus might time out.

-   No extra steps are taken to suppress client messages, such as `NOTICE` and `WARNING` messages emitted
by PostgreSQL and or any possible extensions, including the BDR extension. It's your
responsibility to suppress them by setting appropriate variables, such as `client_min_messages`, 
`bdr.camo_enable_client_warnings`, and so on.

## Performance testing and tuning

PGD allows you to issue write transactions onto multiple nodes. Bringing
those writes back together onto each node has a performance cost.

First, replaying changes from another node has a CPU cost and an I/O cost,
and it generates WAL records. The resource use is usually less
than in the original transaction since CPU overhead is lower as a result
of not needing to reexecute SQL. In the case of UPDATE and DELETE
transactions, there might be I/O costs on replay if data isn't cached.

Second, replaying changes holds table-level and row-level locks that can produce
contention against local workloads. The conflict-free replicated data types
(CRDT) and column-level conflict detection (CLCD) features ensure you get the
correct answers even for concurrent updates, but they don't remove the normal
locking overheads. If you get locking contention, try to avoid conflicting
updates, or keep transactions as short as possible. A heavily updated row in a
larger transaction causes a bottleneck on performance for that transaction.
Complex applications require some thought to maintain scalability.

If you think you're having performance problems, develop performance tests using
the benchmarking tools. pgd_bench allows you to write custom test scripts specific
to your use case so you can understand the overhead of your SQL and measure the
impact of concurrent execution.

If PGD is running slow, then we suggest the following:

1.  Write a custom test script for pgd_bench, as close as you can make it
    to the production system's problem case.
2.  Run the script on one node to give you a baseline figure.
3.  Run the script on as many nodes as occur in production, using the
    same number of sessions in total as you did on one node. This technique
    shows you the effect of moving to multiple nodes.
4.  Increase the number of sessions for these two tests so you can
    plot the effect of increased contention on your application.
5.  Make sure your tests are long enough to account for replication delays.
6.  Ensure that replication delay isn't growing during your tests.

Use all of the normal Postgres tuning features to improve the speed
of critical parts of your application.
