title: HARP Proxy
---

HARP Proxy is a daemon that acts as an abstraction layer between the client 
application and Postgres. It interfaces with the consensus layer to obtain the 
identity of the current lead master node and directs traffic to that location. 
During a planned switchover or unplanned failover, it 
redirects to the new lead master node as dictated by the DCS.

You can select between `pgbouncer` or `builtin` for HARP Proxy.  If you don't specify 
a proxy type, the default is `builtin`. When using `pgbouncer`, HARP Proxy is 
an interface layer between the DCS and PgBouncer. As such, PgBouncer is a 
prerequisite and must also be installed for HARP Proxy to 
fully manage its activity.

The builtin proxy doesn't require any additional software. When using builtin, 
HARP Proxy functions as a level 4 pass-through proxy.

## Builtin proxy: how it works

Upon starting, HARP Proxy listens for incoming connections on the listening 
address and listening port specified in the bootstrap file per proxy instance.  
All application client traffic then passes through builtin proxy into the 
current lead master node for the location where this proxy is operating.

If the lead master lease isn't set, HARP Proxy disconnects all 
connection traffic until a new lead master is established. This also applies
to circumstances when `harpctl promote` is used to invoke a planned transition
to a new lead master. The disconnect is immediate.

### Configuration

Choose the built-in proxy by setting the proxy type to `builtin`. The only 
other option that applies to the built-in proxy is `max_client_conn`, which 
specifies the maximum allowed client connections.  If `max_client_conn` is
higher than what the system can handle, it is lowered to a setting
that's within the capability of the system that the proxy is on.

## PgBouncer: how it works

!!! Note
    If you need more configurability of pgbouncer than what Harp Proxy provides,
    the recommended setup is to use builtin proxy and have pgbouncer point to it.

Upon starting, HARP Proxy launches PgBouncer if it's not already running
and leaves client connections paused. After, it contacts the 
DCS to determine the identity of the lead master, configure PgBouncer to use 
this as the target for database connections, and resume connection activity. 
All application client traffic then passes through PgBouncer into the 
current lead master node for the location where this proxy is operating.

While PgBouncer is running, HARP Proxy checks its status based on the 
`monitor_interval` configuration setting in the DCS and stores it in the
DCS for monitoring purposes. This configuration allows interrogation with `harpctl` to
retrieve status of all configured proxies or any one proxy.

If the lead master lease isn't set, HARP Proxy pauses all 
connection traffic until a new lead master is established. This also applies
to circumstances when `harpctl promote` is used to invoke a planned transition
to a new lead master. It uses a PgBouncer `PAUSE` command for this, so existing
sessions are allowed to complete any pending transactions before they're held
in stasis.

### PgBouncer configuration file

When HARP Proxy uses PgBouncer for connection management and redirection, 
a `pgbouncer.ini` file must exist. HARP Manager builds this file based on various
runtime directives as defined in [Proxy directives](04_configuration).

This file is located in the same folder as the `config.yml` used by HARP
Proxy. Any PgBouncer process launched by HARP Proxy uses this configuration
file, and you can use it for debugging or information purposes. Modifications 
to this automatically generated `pgbouncer.ini` file are lost any time
HARP Proxy restarts, so use `harpctl set proxy` to alter these settings
instead. Calling `harpctl set proxy` doesn't update the `pgbouncer.ini` file until the proxy restarts.

### Disabling and reenabling HARP Proxy node management

You can temporarily pause HARP Proxy control of PgBouncer. This 
results in a state where the daemon continues running but doesn't perform any 
operations that can affect existing behavior of the cluster. Reenabling 
management causes it to resume operation.

An example of temporarily disabling management of a specific proxy is:

```bash
harpctl unmanage proxy proxy1
```

See [harpctl command-line tool](08_harpctl) for more details.

Proxy node management is enabled by default.

### Passthrough user authentication

With pgbouncer, we strongly recommend configuring HARP Proxy to use the `auth_user` and 
`auth_query` runtime directives. If these aren't set, the PgBouncer 
`userlist.txt` file must include username and password hash combinations for 
every user PgBouncer needs to authenticate on behalf of Postgres.

Do *not* use the `pgbouncer` user, as this this is used by HARP 
Proxy as an admin-level user to operate the underlying PgBouncer 
service.

### Configuration

HARP Proxy expects the `dcs`, `cluster`, and `proxy` configuration stanzas. The 
following is a functional example:

```yaml
cluster:
  name: mycluster

dcs:
  driver: etcd
  endpoints:
    - host1:2379
    - host2:2379
    - host3:2379

proxy:
  name: proxy1
```
Each proxy connects to the DCS to retrieve the hosts and ports to listen on for connections.

### Usage

This is the basic usage for HARP Proxy:

```bash
Usage of ./harp-proxy:
  -f string
    	Optional path to config file (shorthand)
  --config string
    	Optional path to config file
```

There are no arguments to launch `harp-proxy` as a forked daemon. 
This software is designed to be launched through systemd or in a container 
as a top-level process. This also means output is directed to STDOUT and STDERR
for capture and access through journald or an attached container terminal.
