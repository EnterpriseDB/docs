A standard installation of HARP includes two system services:

* HARP Manager (`harp-manager`) on the node being managed
* HARP Proxy (`harp-proxy`) elsewhere

There are two ways to install and configure these services to manage
Postgres for proper quorum-based connection routing.

## Software versions

HARP has dependencies on external software. These must fit a minimum
version as listed here.

| Software  | Min version |
|-----------|---------|
| etcd      | 3.4     |
| PgBouncer | 1.14    |

## TPAExec

The easiest way to install and configure HARP is to use the EDB TPAexec utility
for cluster deployment and management. For details on this software, see the
[TPAexec product page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/deployments/tpaexec/).

!!! Note
    TPAExec is currently available only through an EULA specifically dedicated
    to EDB Postgres Distributed cluster deployments. If you can't access the TPAExec URL,
    contact your sales or account representative.

Configure TPAexec to recognize that cluster routing is
managed through HARP by ensuring the TPA `config.yml` file contains these
attributes:

```yaml
cluster_vars:
  failover_manager: harp
```

!!! Note
    Versions of TPAexec earlier than 21.1 require a slightly different approach:

    ```yaml
    cluster_vars:
      enable_harp: true
    ```

After this, install HARP by invoking the `tpaexec` commands
for making cluster modifications:

```bash
tpaexec provision ${CLUSTER_DIR}
tpaexec deploy ${CLUSTER_DIR}
```

No other modifications are necessary apart from cluster-specific
considerations.


## Package installation

Currently CentOS/RHEL packages are provided by the EDB packaging
infrastructure. For details, see the [HARP product
page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/harp/latest/).

### etcd packages

Currently `etcd` packages for many popular Linux distributions aren't
available by their standard public repositories. EDB has therefore packaged
`etcd` for RHEL and CentOS versions 7 and 8, Debian, and variants such as
Ubuntu LTS. You need access to our HARP package repository to use
these libraries.

## Consensus layer

HARP requires a distributed consensus layer to operate. Currently this must be
either `bdr` or `etcd`. If using fewer than three BDR nodes, you might need to rely on `etcd`. Otherwise any BDR service outage reduces the
consensus layer to a single node and thus prevents node consensus and disables
Postgres routing.

### etcd

If you're using `etcd` as the consensus layer, `etcd` must be installed either
directly on the Postgres nodes or in a separate location they can access.

To set `etcd` as the consensus layer, include this code in the HARP `config.yml`
configuration file:

```yaml
dcs:
  driver: etcd
  endpoints:
    - host1:2379
    - host2:2379
    - host3:2379
```

When using TPAExec, all configured etcd endpoints are entered here
automatically.

### BDR

The `bdr` native consensus layer is available from BDR 3.6.21 and 3.7.3. This
consensus layer model requires no supplementary software when managing routing
for a EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

To ensure quorum is possible in the cluster, always
use more than two nodes so that BDR's consensus layer remains responsive during node
maintenance or outages.

To set BDR as the consensus layer, include this in the `config.yml`
configuration file:

```yaml
dcs:
  driver: bdr
  endpoints:
    - host=host1 dbname=bdrdb user=harp_user
    - host=host2 dbname=bdrdb user=harp_user
    - host=host3 dbname=bdrdb user=harp_user
```

The endpoints for a BDR consensus layer follow the
standard Postgres DSN connection format.
