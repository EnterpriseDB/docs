EDB Postgres Distributed provides multi-master replication and data distribution with advanced conflict management, data-loss protection, and throughput up to 5X faster than native logical replication, and enables distributed PostgreSQL clusters with high availability up to five 9s.

By default EDB Postgres Distributed uses asynchronous replication, applying changes on
the peer nodes only after the local commit. Additional levels of synchronicity can
be configured between different nodes, groups of nodes or all nodes by configuring
[Group Commit](/pgd/latest/bdr/group-commit), [CAMO](/pgd/latest/bdr/camo), or
[Eager](/pgd/latest/bdr/eager) replication.
