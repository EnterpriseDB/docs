title: "Limitations"

Take these EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) design limitations
into account when planning your deployment.

## Nodes 

- PGD can run hundreds of nodes, assuming adequate hardware and network. However,
  for mesh-based deployments, we generally don’t recommend running more than 48
  nodes in one cluster. If you need extra read scalability beyond the 48-node
  limit, you can add subscriber-only nodes without adding connections to the
  mesh network.

- PGD currently has a hard limit of no more than 1000 active nodes, as this is
  the current maximum Raft connections allowed.

- The minimum recommended number of nodes in a group is three to provide fault
  tolerance for PGD's consensus mechanism. With just two nodes, consensus would
  fail if one of the nodes were unresponsive. Consensus is required for some PGD
  operations, such as distributed sequence generation. For more information about
  the consensus mechanism used by EDB Postgres Distributed, see [Architectural
  details](../architectures/#architecture-details).


## Multiple databases on single instances

Support for using PGD for multiple databases on the same Postgres instance is
**deprecated** beginning with PGD 5 and will no longer be supported with PGD 6. As
we extend the capabilities of the product, the added complexity introduced
operationally and functionally is no longer viable in a multi-database design.

It's best practice and we recommend that you configure only one database per PGD instance. 

The deployment automation with TPA and the tooling such as the CLI
and proxy already codify that recommendation. 

While it's still possible to host up to 10 databases in a single instance,
doing so incurs many immediate risks and current limitations:

- If PGD configuration changes are needed, you must execute administrative commands 
  for each database. Doing so increases the risk for potential
  inconsistencies and errors.

- You must monitor each database separately, adding overhead.

- TPAexec assumes one database. Additional coding is needed by customers or PS
  in a post-deploy hook to set up replication for additional databases.

- PGD Proxy works at the Postgres instance level, not at the database level,
  meaning the leader node is the same for all databases.

- Each additional database increases the resource requirements on the server.
  Each one needs its own set of worker processes maintaining replication, for example,
  logical workers, WAL senders, and WAL receivers. Each one also needs its own
  set of connections to other instances in the replication cluster. These needs might
  severely impact performance of all databases.

- When rebuilding or adding a node, you can use the physical initialization method
  (`bdr_init_physical`) for one database only for one node. You must initialize all
  other databases by logical replication, which can
  be problematic for large databases because of the time it might take.

- Synchronous replication methods, for example, CAMO, Group Commit, won’t work as
  expected. Since the Postgres WAL is shared between the databases, a
  synchronous commit confirmation can come from any database, not necessarily in
  the right order of commits.

- CLI and OTEL integration (new with v5) assumes one database. 

## CAMO

[Commit At Most Once](durability/camo) (CAMO) is a feature that aims to prevent
applications committing more than once. If you use this feature, take 
these limitations into account when planning:

-  CAMO is designed to query the results of a recently failed COMMIT on
the origin node. So, in case of disconnection, code the application
to immediately request the transaction status from the CAMO partner.
Have as little delay as possible after the failure before
requesting the status. Applications must not rely on CAMO decisions
being stored for longer than 15 minutes.

-  If the application forgets the global identifier assigned, for example,
as a result of a restart, there's no easy way to recover
it. Therefore, we recommend that applications wait for outstanding
transactions to end before shutting down.

-  For the client to apply proper checks, a transaction protected by CAMO
can't be a single statement with implicit transaction control. You also can't
use CAMO with a transaction-controlling procedure or
in a `DO` block that tries to start or end transactions.

- CAMO resolves commit status but doesn't resolve pending
notifications on commit. CAMO and Eager replication options don't
allow the `NOTIFY` SQL command or the `pg_notify()` function.
They also don't allow `LISTEN` or `UNLISTEN`.

- When replaying changes, CAMO transactions might detect conflicts just
the same as other transactions. If timestamp-conflict detection is used,
the CAMO transaction uses the timestamp of the prepare-on-the-origin
node, which is before the transaction becomes visible on the origin
node itself.

- CAMO isn't currently compatible with transaction streaming.
Be sure to disable transaction streaming when planning to use
CAMO. You can configure this option globally or in the PGD node group. See
[Transaction streaming configuration](../transaction-streaming#configuration).

## Other limitations

This (noncomprehensive) list includes other limitations that are expected and
are by design. We don't expect to resolve them in the future. 
Consider these limitations when planning your deployment:

-   Replacing a node with its physical standby doesn't work for nodes that use
    CAMO/Eager/Group Commit. We don't recommend combining physical standbys and EDB Postgres
    Distributed, even if it's possible.

-   A `galloc` sequence might skip some chunks if you create the sequence in a
    rolled back transaction and then create it again with the same name. Skipping chunks can
    also occur if you create and drop the sequence when DDL replication isn't active
    and then you create it again when DDL replication is active. The impact of
    the problem is mild because the sequence guarantees aren't violated. The
    sequence skips only some initial chunks. Also, as a workaround, you can
    specify the starting value for the sequence as an argument to the
    `bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind()` function.

-   Legacy synchronous replication uses a mechanism for transaction confirmation
    different from the one used by CAMO, Eager, and Group Commit. The two aren't compatible, 
    so don't use them together.
