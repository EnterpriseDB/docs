Several Postgres configuration parameters affect PGD
nodes. You can set these parameters differently on each node,
although that isn't generally recommended.

## Postgres settings

PGD requires these Postgres settings to run correctly:

-   `wal_level` &mdash; Must be set to `logical`, since PGD relies on logical decoding.
-   `shared_preload_libraries` &mdash; Must contain `bdr`, although it can contain
     other entries before or after, as needed. However, don't include `pglogical`.
-   `track_commit_timestamp` &mdash; Must be set to `on` for conflict resolution to
    retrieve the timestamp for each conflicting row.

PGD requires these PostgreSQL settings to be set to appropriate values,
which vary according to the size and scale of the cluster.

-   `logical_decoding_work_mem` &mdash; Memory buffer size used by logical decoding.
    Transactions larger than this overflow the buffer and are stored
    temporarily on local disk. Default is 64 MB, but you can set it much higher.
-   `max_worker_processes` &mdash; PGD uses background workers for replication
    and maintenance tasks, so you need enough worker slots for it to
    work correctly. The formula for the correct minimal number of workers, for each database, is:
    -  One per PostgreSQL instance plus
    -  One per database on that instance plus
    -  Four per PGD-enabled database plus
    -  One per peer node in the PGD group plus
    -  One for each writer-enabled per peer node in the PGD group
    You might need more worker processes temporarily when a node is being
    removed from a PGD group.
-   `max_wal_senders` &mdash; Two needed per every peer node.
-   `max_replication_slots` &mdash; Same as `max_wal_senders`.
-   `wal_sender_timeout` and `wal_receiver_timeout` &mdash; Determines how
    quickly a node considers its CAMO partner as disconnected or
    reconnected. See [CAMO failure scenarios](durability/camo/#failure-scenarios) for
    details.

In normal running for a group with N peer nodes, PGD requires
N slots and WAL senders. During synchronization, PGD temporarily uses another
N - 1 slots and WAL senders, so be careful to set the parameters high enough
for this occasional peak demand.

With parallel apply turned on, the number of slots must be increased to
N slots from the formula \* writers. This is because the `max_replication_slots`
also sets the maximum number of replication origins, and some of the functionality
of parallel apply uses extra origin per writer.

When the [decoding worker](nodes#decoding-worker) is enabled, this
process requires one extra replication slot per PGD group.

Changing these parameters requires restarting the local node:
`max_worker_processes`, `max_wal_senders`, `max_replication_slots`.

A legacy synchronous replication mode is supported via the use of the following
parameters. See [Durability and performance options](durability) for details and
limitations.

-   `synchronous_commit` &mdash; Affects the durability and performance of PGD replication.
    in a similar way to [physical replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/11/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-SYNCHRONOUS-COMMIT).
-   `synchronous_standby_names` &mdash; Same as above.

## BDR-specific settings

You can also set BDR-specific configuration settings.
Unless noted otherwise, you can set the values at any time.

### Conflict handling

-   `bdr.default_conflict_detection` &mdash; Sets the default conflict detection method
    for newly created tables. Accepts same values as
    [bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection()](consistency/conflicts#bdralter_table_conflict_detection).

### Global sequence parameters

-   `bdr.default_sequence_kind` &mdash; Sets the default [sequence kind](sequences).
    The default value is `distributed`, which means `snowflakeid` is used
    for `int8` sequences (i.e., `bigserial`) and `galloc` sequence for `int4`
    (i.e., `serial`) and `int2` sequences.

### DDL handling

-   `bdr.default_replica_identity` &mdash; Sets the default value for `REPLICA IDENTITY`
    on newly created tables. The `REPLICA IDENTITY` defines the information
    written to the write-ahead log to identify rows that are updated or deleted.

    The accepted values are:

    -   `DEFAULT` &mdash; Records the old values of the columns of the primary key,
        if any (this is the default PostgreSQL behavior).
    -   `FULL` &mdash; Records the old values of all columns in the row.
    -   `NOTHING` &mdash; Records no information about the old row.

    See [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertable.html#SQL-CREATETABLE-REPLICA-IDENTITY)
    for more details.

    BDR can't replicate `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations on tables without a `PRIMARY KEY`
    or `UNIQUE` constraint. The exception is when the replica identity for the table is `FULL`,
    either by table-specific configuration or by `bdr.default_replica_identity`.

      If `bdr.default_replica_identity` is `DEFAULT` and there is a `UNIQUE`
      constraint on the table, it isn't automatically picked up as
      `REPLICA IDENTITY`. You need to set it explicitly when creating the table
      or after, as described above.

    Setting the replica identity of tables to `FULL` increases the volume of
    WAL written and the amount of data replicated on the wire for the table.

-   `bdr.ddl_replication` &mdash; Automatically replicate DDL across nodes (default is
    `on`).

    This parameter can be set only by bdr_superuser or superuser roles.

    Running DDL or calling BDR administration functions with
    `bdr.ddl_replication = off` can create situations where replication stops
    until an administrator can intervene. See [DDL replication](ddl)
    for details.

    A `LOG`-level log message is emitted to the PostgreSQL server logs whenever
    `bdr.ddl_replication` is set to `off`. Additionally, a `WARNING-level`
    message is written whenever replication of captured DDL commands or BDR
    replication functions is skipped due to this setting.

-   `bdr.role_replication` &mdash; Automatically replicate ROLE commands across nodes
    (default is `on`). Only a superuser can set this parameter. This setting
    works only if `bdr.ddl_replication` is turned on as well.

    Turning this off without using external methods to ensure roles are in sync
    across all nodes might cause replicated DDL to interrupt replication until
    the administrator intervenes.

    See [Role manipulation statements](ddl/#role-manipulation-statements)
    for details.

-   `bdr.ddl_locking` &mdash; Configures the operation mode of global locking for DDL.

    This parameter can be set only by bdr_superuser or superuser roles.

    Possible options are:

    -   off &mdash; Don't use global locking for DDL operations.
    -   on &mdash; Use global locking for all DDL operations.
    -   dml &mdash; Use global locking only for DDL operations that need to prevent
        writes by taking the global DML lock for a relation.

    A `LOG`-level log message is emitted to the PostgreSQL server logs
    whenever `bdr.ddl_replication` is set to `off`. Additionally, a `WARNING`
    message is written whenever any global locking steps are skipped due to
    this setting. It's normal for some statements to result in two `WARNING` messages:
    one for skipping the DML lock and one for skipping the DDL lock.

-   `bdr.truncate_locking` &mdash; False by default, this configuration option sets the
    TRUNCATE command's locking behavior. Determines whether (when true) TRUNCATE
    obeys the `bdr.ddl_locking` setting.

### Global locking

-   `bdr.ddl_locking` &mdash; Described above.
-   `bdr.global_lock_max_locks` &mdash; Maximum number of global locks that can be
    held on a node (default 1000). Can be set only at Postgres server start.
-   `bdr.global_lock_timeout` &mdash; Sets the maximum allowed duration of any wait
    for a global lock (default 10 minutes). A value of zero disables this timeout.
-   `bdr.global_lock_statement_timeout` &mdash; Sets the maximum allowed duration of
    any statement holding a global lock (default 60 minutes).
    A value of zero disables this timeout.
-   `bdr.global_lock_idle_timeout` &mdash; Sets the maximum allowed duration of
    idle time in transaction holding a global lock (default 10 minutes).
    A value of zero disables this timeout.
-   `bdr.predictive_checks` &mdash; Log level for predictive checks (currently used only
    by global locks). Can be `DEBUG`, `LOG`, `WARNING` (default), or `ERROR`. Predictive checks
    are early validations for expected cluster state when doing certain operations. You
    can use them for those operations for fail early rather than wait for
    timeouts. In global lock terms, BDR checks that there are enough nodes
    connected and withing reasonable lag limit for getting quorum needed by the
    global lock.

### Node management

-   `bdr.replay_progress_frequency` &mdash; Interval for sending replication position
    info to the rest of the cluster (default 1 minute).

-   `bdr.standby_slot_names` &mdash; Require these slots to receive and confirm
    replication changes before any other ones. This setting is useful primarily when
    using physical standbys for failover or when using subscribe-only nodes.

### Generic replication

-   `bdr.writers_per_subscription` &mdash; Default number of writers per
    subscription (in BDR, you can also change this with
    `bdr.alter_node_group_config` for a group).

-   `bdr.max_writers_per_subscription` &mdash; Maximum number of writers
    per subscription (sets upper limit for the setting above).

-   `bdr.xact_replication` &mdash; Replicate current transaction (default is `on`).

    Turning this off makes the whole transaction local only, which
    means the transaction isn't visible to logical decoding by
    BDR and all other downstream targets of logical decoding. Data isn't
    transferred to any other node, including logical standby nodes.

    This parameter can be set only by the bdr_superuser or superuser roles.

    This parameter can be set only inside the current transaction using the
    `SET LOCAL` command unless `bdr.permit_unsafe_commands = on`.

!!! Note
    Even with transaction replication disabled, WAL is generated,
    but those changes are filtered away on the origin.

!!! Warning
    Turning off `bdr.xact_replication` leads to data
    inconsistency between nodes. Use it only to recover from
    data divergence between nodes or in
    replication situations where changes on single nodes are required for
    replication to continue. Use at your own risk.

-   `bdr.permit_unsafe_commands` &mdash; Option to override safety check on commands
    that are deemed unsafe for general use.

    Requires `bdr_superuser` or PostgreSQL superuser.

!!! Warning
    The commands that are normally not considered safe can either
    produce inconsistent results or break replication altogether. Use at your
    own risk.

-   `bdr.batch_inserts` &mdash; Number of consecutive inserts to one table in
    a single transaction turns on batch processing of inserts for that table.

    This option allows replication of large data loads as COPY internally,
    rather than set of inserts. It is also how the initial data during node join
    is copied.

-   `bdr.maximum_clock_skew`

    This option specifies the maximum difference between
    the incoming transaction commit timestamp and the current time on the
    subscriber before triggering `bdr.maximum_clock_skew_action`.

    It checks if the timestamp of the currently replayed transaction is in the
    future compared to the current time on the subscriber. If it is, and the
    difference is larger than `bdr.maximum_clock_skew`, it performs the action
    specified by the `bdr.maximum_clock_skew_action` setting.

    The default is `-1`, which means ignore clock skew (the check is turned
    off). It's valid to set 0 as when the clock on all servers are synchronized.
    The fact that we are replaying the transaction means it has been committed in
    the past.

-   `bdr.maximum_clock_skew_action`

    This specifies the action to take if a clock skew higher than
    `bdr.maximum_clock_skew` is detected.

    There are two possible values for this option:

    -   `WARN` &mdash; Log a warning about this fact. The warnings are logged once per
        minute (the default) at the maximum to prevent flooding the server log.
    -   `WAIT` &mdash; Wait until the current local timestamp is no longer older than
        remote commit timestamp minus the `bdr.maximum_clock_skew`.

-   `bdr.accept_connections` &mdash; Option to enable or disable connections to BDR.
    Defaults to `on`.

    Requires `bdr_superuser` or PostgreSQL superuser.

### `bdr.standby_slot_names`

This option is typically used in failover configurations to ensure that the
failover-candidate streaming physical replicas for this BDR node
have received and flushed all changes before they ever become visible to
subscribers. That guarantees that a commit can't vanish on failover to a
standby for the provider.

Replication slots whose names are listed in the comma-separated
`bdr.standby_slot_names` list are treated specially by the walsender
on a BDR node.

BDR's logical replication walsenders ensures that all local changes
are sent and flushed to the replication slots in `bdr.standby_slot_names`
before the node sends those changes to any other BDR replication
clients. Effectively, it provides a synchronous replication barrier between the
named list of slots and all other replication clients.

Any replication slot can be listed in `bdr.standby_slot_names`. Both
logical and physical slots work, but it's generally used for physical slots.

Without this safeguard, two anomalies are possible where a commit can be
received by a subscriber and then vanish from the provider on failover because
the failover candidate hadn't received it yet:

-   For 1+ subscribers, the subscriber might have applied the change but the new
    provider might execute new transactions that conflict with the received change,
    as it never happened as far as the provider is concerned.

-   For 2+ subscribers, at the time of failover, not all subscribers have applied
    the change. The subscribers now have inconsistent and irreconcilable states
    because the subscribers that didn't receive the commit have no way to get it.

Setting `bdr.standby_slot_names` by design causes other subscribers
not listed in there to lag behind the provider if the required number
of listed nodes are not keeping up. Monitoring is thus essential.

Another use case where `bdr.standby_slot_names` is useful is when
using a subscriber-only node, to ensure that it does not move ahead of
any of the regular BDR nodes. This can best be achieved by listing the
logical slots of all regular BDR peer nodes in combination with
setting `bdr.standby_slots_min_confirmed` to at least one.

### `bdr.standby_slots_min_confirmed`

Controls how many of the `bdr.standby_slot_names` have to confirm before
we send data to BDR subscribers.

### `bdr.writer_input_queue_size`

This option specifies the size of the shared memory queue used
by the receiver to send data to the writer process. If the writer process is
stalled or making slow progress, then the queue might get filled up, stalling
the receiver process too. So it's important to provide enough shared memory for
this queue. The default is 1 MB, and the maximum allowed size is 1 GB. While any
storage size specifier can be used to set the GUC, the default is KB.

### `bdr.writer_output_queue_size`

This option specifies the size of the shared memory queue used
by the receiver to receive data from the writer process. Since the writer
isn't expected to send a large amount of data, a relatively smaller sized queue
is enough. The default is 32 KB, and the maximum allowed size is 1 MB.
While any storage size specifier can be used to set the GUC, the default is
KB.

### `bdr.min_worker_backoff_delay`

Rate limit BDR background worker launches by preventing a given worker
from being relaunched more often than every
`bdr.min_worker_backoff_delay` milliseconds. On repeated errors, the backoff
increases exponentially with added jitter up to maximum of
`bdr.max_worker_backoff_delay`.

Time-unit suffixes are supported.

!!! Note
    This setting currently affects only receiver worker, which means it
    primarily affects how fast a subscription tries to reconnect on error
    or connection failure.

The default for `bdr.min_worker_backoff_delay` is 1 second. For
`bdr.max_worker_backoff_delay`, it is 1 minute.

If the backoff delay setting is changed and the PostgreSQL configuration is
reloaded, then all current backoff waits for reset. Additionally, the
`bdr.worker_task_reset_backoff_all()` function is provided to allow the
administrator to force all backoff intervals to immediately expire.

A tracking table in shared memory is maintained to remember the last launch
time of each type of worker. This tracking table isn't persistent. It is
cleared by PostgreSQL restarts, including soft restarts during crash recovery
after an unclean backend exit.

You can use the view [`bdr.worker_tasks`](catalogs#bdrworker_tasks) to inspect this state so the administrator can see any backoff
rate limiting currently in effect.

For rate limiting purposes, workers are classified by task. This key consists
of the worker role, database OID, subscription ID, subscription writer ID,
extension library name and function name, extension-supplied worker name, and
the remote relation ID for sync writers. `NULL` is used where a given
classifier doesn't apply, for example, manager workers don't have a subscription ID
and receivers don't have a writer ID.

### CRDTs

-   `bdr.crdt_raw_value` &mdash; Sets the output format of [CRDT data types](consistency/crdt).
    The default output (when this setting is `off`) is to return only the current
    value of the base CRDT type (for example, a bigint for `crdt_pncounter`).
    When set to `on`, the returned value represents the full representation of
    the CRDT value, which can, for example, include the state from multiple nodes.

### Max prepared transactions

-   `max_prepared_transactions` &mdash; Needs to be set high enough to cope
    with the maximum number of concurrent prepared transactions across
    the cluster due to explicit two-phase commits, CAMO, or Eager
    transactions. Exceeding the limit prevents a node from running a
    local two-phase commit or CAMO transaction and prevents all
    Eager transactions on the cluster.
    You can set this only at Postgres server start.

### Eager Replication

-   `bdr.commit_scope` &mdash; Set's the current (or default)
    [Commit Scope](durability/commit-scopes) (default `local`).

### Commit At Most Once

-   `bdr.camo_local_mode_delay` &mdash; The commit delay that applies in
    CAMO's asynchronous mode to emulate the overhead that normally occurs with
    the CAMO partner having to confirm transactions. Defaults to 5 ms.
    Set to `0` to disable this feature.
-   `bdr.camo_enable_client_warnings` &mdash; Emit warnings if an activity is
    carried out in the database for which CAMO properties can't be
    guaranteed. This is enabled by default. Well-informed users can choose
    to disable this to reduce the amount of warnings going into their logs.

### Transaction streaming

-   `bdr.default_streaming_mode` &mdash; Used to control transaction streaming by
    the subscriber node. Permissible values are: `off`, `writer`, `file`, and `auto`.
    Defaults to `auto`. If set to `off`, the subscriber doesn't request
    transaction streaming. If set to one of the other values, the
    subscriber requests transaction streaming and the publisher provides
    it if it supports them and if configured at group level. For
    more details, see [Transaction streaming](transaction-streaming).

### Lag control

-   `bdr.lag_control_max_commit_delay` &mdash; Maximum acceptable post commit delay that
    can be tolerated, in fractional milliseconds.
-   `bdr.lag_control_max_lag_size` &mdash; Maximum acceptable lag size that can be tolerated,
    in kilobytes.
-   `bdr.lag_control_max_lag_time` &mdash; Maximum acceptable lag time that can be tolerated,
    in milliseconds.
-   `bdr.lag_control_min_conforming_nodes` &mdash; Minimum number of nodes required to stay
    below acceptable lag measures.
-   `bdr.lag_control_commit_delay_adjust` &mdash; Commit delay micro adjustment measured as a
    fraction of the maximum commit delay time. At a default value of 0.01%, it takes
    100 net increments to reach the maximum commit delay.
-   `bdr.lag_control_sample_interval` &mdash; Minimum time between lag samples and
    commit delay micro adjustments, in milliseconds.
-   `bdr.lag_control_commit_delay_start` &mdash; The lag threshold at which commit delay
    increments start to be applied, expressed as a fraction of acceptable lag measures.
    At a default value of 1.0%, commit delay increments don't begin until acceptable lag
    measures are breached.

    By setting a smaller fraction, it might be possible to prevent a breach
    by "bending the lag curve" earlier so that it's asymptotic with the
    acceptable lag measure.

### Timestamp-based snapshots

-   `snapshot_timestamp` &mdash; Turns on the use of
    [timestamp-based snapshots](tssnapshots) and sets the timestamp to use.
-   `bdr.timestamp_snapshot_keep` &mdash; Time to keep valid snapshots for the
    timestamp-based snapshot use (default is `0`, meaning don't keep past snapshots).

### Monitoring and logging

-   `bdr.debug_level` &mdash; Defines the log level that BDR uses to write
    its debug messages. The default value is `debug2`. If you want to see
    detailed BDR debug output, set `bdr.debug_level = 'log'`.

-   `bdr.trace_level` &mdash; Similar to the above, this defines the log level
    to use for BDR trace messages. Enabling tracing on all nodes of a
    EDB Postgres Distributed cluster might help EDB Support to diagnose issues.
    You can set this only at Postgres server start.

!!! Warning
    Setting `bdr.debug_level` or `bdr.trace_level` to a value >=
    `log_min_messages` can produce a very large volume of log output, so don't
    enabled it long term in production unless plans are in place for log filtering,
    archival, and rotation to prevent disk space exhaustion.

-   `bdr.track_subscription_apply` &mdash; Track apply statistics for
    each subscription.
-   `bdr.track_relation_apply` &mdash; Track apply statistics for each
    relation.
-   `bdr.track_apply_lock_timing` &mdash; Track lock timing when tracking
    statistics for relations.

### Internals

-   `bdr.raft_keep_min_entries` &mdash; The minimum number of entries to keep in the
    Raft log when doing log compaction (default 100). The value of 0 disables
    log compaction. You can set this only at Postgres server start.
    !!! Warning
        If log compaction is disabled, the log grows in size forever.
-   `bdr.raft_response_timeout` &mdash; To account for network failures, the
    Raft consensus protocol implemented times out requests after a
    certain amount of time. This timeout defaults to 30 seconds.
-   `bdr.raft_log_min_apply_duration` &mdash; To move the state machine
    forward, Raft appends entries to its internal log. During normal
    operation, appending takes only a few milliseconds. This poses an
    upper threshold on the duration of that append action, above which
    an `INFO` message is logged. This can indicate a
    problem. Default value of this parameter is 3000 ms.
-   `bdr.raft_log_min_message_duration` &mdash; When to log a consensus request.
     Measure roundtrip time of a bdr consensus request and log an
     `INFO` message if the time exceeds this parameter. Default value
     of this parameter is 5000 ms.
-   `bdr.raft_group_max_connections` &mdash; The maximum number of connections
     across all BDR groups for a Postgres server. These connections carry
     bdr consensus requests between the groups' nodes. Default value of this
     parameter is 100 connections. You can set it only at Postgres server start.
-   `bdr.backwards_compatibility` &mdash; Specifies the version to be
    backward compatible to, in the same numerical format as used by
    `bdr.bdr_version_num`, e.g., `30618`. Enables exact behavior of a
    former BDR version, even if this has generally unwanted effects.
    Defaults to the current BDR version. Since this changes from release
    to release, we advise against explicit use in the configuration
    file unless the value is different from the current version.
-   `bdr.track_replication_estimates` &mdash; Track replication estimates in terms
    of apply rates and catchup intervals for peer nodes. Protocols like CAMO can use this information
    to estimate the readiness of a
    peer node. This parameter is enabled by default.
-   `bdr.lag_tracker_apply_rate_weight` &mdash; We monitor how far behind peer nodes
    are in terms of applying WAL from the local node and calculate a moving
    average of the apply rates for the lag tracking. This parameter specifies
    how much contribution newer calculated values have in this moving average
    calculation. Default value is 0.1.
