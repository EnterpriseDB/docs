Perform PGD management primarily by using functions you call from SQL.
All functions in PGD are exposed in the `bdr` schema. Schema qualify any calls to these
functions instead of putting `bdr` in the
`search_path`.

## Version information functions

### bdr.bdr_version

This function retrieves the textual representation of the version
of the BDR extension currently in use.

### bdr.bdr_version_num

This function retrieves the version number of the BDR extension that is
currently in use. Version numbers are monotonically increasing, allowing this
value to be used for less-than and greater-than comparisons.

The following formula returns the version number consisting of
major version, minor version, and patch release into a single numerical
value:

```
MAJOR_VERSION * 10000 + MINOR_VERSION * 100 + PATCH_RELEASE
```

## System information functions

### bdr.get_relation_stats

Returns the relation information.

### bdr.get_subscription_stats

Returns the current subscription statistics.

## System and progress information parameters

PGD exposes some parameters that you can query using `SHOW` in `psql`
or using `PQparameterStatus` (or equivalent) from a client
application.

### bdr.local_node_id

When you initialize a session, this is set to the node id the client is
connected to. This allows an application to figure out the node it's
connected to, even behind a transparent proxy.

It's also used with [Connection pools and proxies](durability/camo#connection-pools-and-proxies).

### bdr.last_committed_lsn

After every `COMMIT` of an asynchronous transaction, this parameter is updated to
point to the end of the commit record on the origin node. Combining it with `bdr.wait_for_apply_queue`,
allows applications
to perform causal reads across multiple nodes, that is, to wait until a transaction
becomes remotely visible.

### transaction_id

As soon as Postgres assigns a transaction id, if CAMO is enabled, this parameter is
updated to show the transaction id just assigned.

### bdr.is_node_connected

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.is_node_connected(node_name name)
```

Returns boolean by checking if the walsender for a given peer is active
on this node.

### bdr.is_node_ready

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.is_node_ready(node_name name, span interval DEFAULT NULL)
```

Returns boolean by checking if the lag is lower than the given span or
lower than the `timeout` for `TO ASYNC` otherwise.

## Consensus function

### bdr.consensus_disable

Disables the consensus worker on the local node until server restart or until
it's reenabled using `bdr.consensus_enable` (whichever happens first).

!!! Warning
    Disabling consensus disables some features of PGD and
    affects availability of the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster if left disabled for a
    long time. Use this function only when working with
    Technical Support.

### bdr.consensus_enable

Reenabled disabled consensus worker on local node.

### bdr.consensus_proto_version

Returns currently used consensus protocol version by the local node.

Needed by the PGD group reconfiguration internal mechanisms.

### bdr.consensus_snapshot_export

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.consensus_snapshot_export(version integer DEFAULT NULL)
```

Generate a new PGD consensus snapshot from the currently committed-and-applied
state of the local node and return it as bytea.

By default, a snapshot for the highest supported Raft version is
exported. But you can override that by passing an explicit `version`
number.

The exporting node doesn't have to be the current Raft leader, and it doesn't
need to be completely up to date with the latest state on the leader. However, `bdr.consensus_snapshot_import()`
might not accept such a snapshot.

The new snapshot isn't automatically stored to the local node's
`bdr.local_consensus_snapshot` table. It's only returned to the caller.

The generated snapshot might be passed to `bdr.consensus_snapshot_import()` on
any other nodes in the same PGD node group that's behind the exporting node's
Raft log position.

The local PGD consensus worker must be disabled for this function to work.
Typical usage is:

```
 SELECT bdr.bdr_consensus_disable();
 \copy (SELECT * FROM bdr.consensus_snapshot_export()) TO 'my_node_consensus_snapshot.data'
 SELECT bdr.bdr_consensus_enable();
```

While the PGD consensus worker is disabled:
-  DDL locking attempts on the node fail or time out.
-  galloc sequences don't get new values.
-  Eager and CAMO transactions pause or error.
-  Other functionality that needs the distributed consensus system is disrupted.
    The required downtime is generally very brief.

Depending on the use case, it might be practical to extract a snapshot that
already exists from the `snapshot` field of the `bdr.local_consensus_snapshot`
table and use that instead. Doing so doesn't require you to stop the consensus worker.

### bdr.consensus_snapshot_import

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.consensus_snapshot_import(IN snapshot bytea)
```

Import a consensus snapshot that was exported by
`bdr.consensus_snapshot_export()`, usually from another node in the same PGD
node group.

It's also possible to use a snapshot extracted directly from the `snapshot`
field of the `bdr.local_consensus_snapshot` table on another node.

This function is useful for resetting a PGD node's catalog state to a known good
state in case of corruption or user error.

You can import the snapshot if the importing node's `apply_index` is less than
or equal to the snapshot-exporting node's `commit_index` when the
snapshot was generated. (See `bdr.get_raft_status()`.) A node that can't accept
the snapshot because its log is already too far ahead raises an error
and makes no changes. The imported snapshot doesn't have to be completely
up to date, as once the snapshot is imported the node fetches the remaining
changes from the current leader.

The PGD consensus worker must be disabled on the importing node for this
function to work. See notes on `bdr.consensus_snapshot_export()` for details.

It's possible to use this function to force the local node to generate a new Raft
snapshot by running:

```
SELECT bdr.consensus_snapshot_import(bdr.consensus_snapshot_export());
```

This approach might also truncate the Raft logs up to the current
applied log position.

### bdr.consensus_snapshot_verify

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.consensus_snapshot_verify(IN snapshot bytea)
```

Verify the given consensus snapshot that was exported by
`bdr.consensus_snapshot_export()`. The snapshot header contains the
version with which it was generated and the node tries to verify it
against the same version.

The snapshot might have been exported on the same node or any other node
in the cluster. If the node verifying the snapshot doesn't support the
version of the exported snapshot, then an error is raised.

### bdr.get_consensus_status

Returns status information about the current consensus (Raft) worker.

### bdr.get_raft_status

Returns status information about the current consensus (Raft) worker.
Alias for `bdr.get_consensus_status`.

### bdr.raft_leadership_transfer

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.raft_leadership_transfer(IN node_name text, IN wait_for_completion boolean)
```

Request the node identified by `node_name` to be the Raft leader. The
request can be initiated from any of the PGD nodes and is
internally forwarded to the current leader to transfer the leadership to
the designated node. The designated node must be an ACTIVE PGD node
with full voting rights.

If `wait_for_completion` is false, the request is served on
a best-effort basis. If the node can't become a leader in the
`bdr.raft_election_timeout` period, then some other capable node
becomes the leader again. Also, the leadership can change over the
period of time per Raft protocol. A `true` return result indicates
only that the request was submitted successfully.

If `wait_for_completion` is `true`, then the function waits until
the given node becomes the new leader and possibly waits infinitely if
the requested node fails to become Raft leader (for example, due to network
issues). We therefore recommend that you always set a `statement_timeout`
with `wait_for_completion` to prevent an infinite loop.

## Utility functions

### bdr.wait_slot_confirm_lsn

Allows you to wait until the last write on this session was replayed
to one or all nodes.

Waits until a slot passes a certain LSN. If no position is supplied, the
current write position is used on the local node.

If no slot name is passed, it waits until all PGD slots pass the LSN.

The function polls every 1000 ms for changes from other nodes.

If a slot is dropped concurrently, the wait ends for that slot.
If a node is currently down and isn't updating its slot, then the wait continues.
You might want to set `statement_timeout` to complete earlier in that case.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.wait_slot_confirm_lsn(slot_name text DEFAULT NULL, target_lsn pg_lsn DEFAULT NULL)
```

#### Parameters

-   `slot_name` &mdash; Name of replication slot or, if NULL, all PGD slots (only).
-   `target_lsn` &mdash; LSN to wait for or, if NULL, use the current write LSN on the
    local node.

### bdr.wait_for_apply_queue

The function `bdr.wait_for_apply_queue` allows a PGD node to wait for
the local application of certain transactions originating from a given
PGD node. It returns only after all transactions from that peer
node are applied locally. An application or a proxy can use this
function to prevent stale reads.

For convenience, PGD provides a variant of this function for
CAMO and the CAMO partner node. See
[bdr.wait_for_camo_partner_queue](durability/camo#wait-for-consumption-of-the-apply-queue-from-the-camo-partner).

In case a specific LSN is given, that's the point in the recovery
stream from which the peer waits. You can use this
with `bdr.last_committed_lsn` retrieved from that peer node on a
previous or concurrent connection.

If the given `target_lsn` is NULL, this function checks the local
receive buffer and uses the LSN of the last transaction received from
the given peer node, effectively waiting for all transactions already
received to be applied. This is especially useful in case the peer
node has failed and it's not known which transactions were sent.
In this case, transactions that are still in transit or
buffered on the sender side aren't waited for.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.wait_for_apply_queue(peer_node_name TEXT, target_lsn pg_lsn)
```

#### Parameters

-   `peer_node_name` &mdash; The name of the peer node from which incoming
    transactions are expected to be queued and to wait
    for. If NULL, waits for all peer node's apply queue to be consumed.
-   `target_lsn` &mdash; The LSN in the replication stream from the peer node
    to wait for, usually learned by way of `bdr.last_committed_lsn` from the
    peer node.

### bdr.get_node_sub_receive_lsn

You can use this function on a subscriber to get the last LSN that was
received from the given origin. It can be either unfiltered or filtered to take into
account only relevant LSN increments for transactions to be applied.

The difference between the output of this function and the output of
`bdr.get_node_sub_apply_lsn()` measures the size of the corresponding
apply queue.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.get_node_sub_receive_lsn(node_name name, committed bool default true)
```

#### Parameters

-   `node_name` &mdash; The name of the node that's the source of the
    replication stream whose LSN is being retrieved.
-   `committed` &mdash;; The default (true) makes this function take into
    account only commits of transactions received rather than the last
    LSN overall. This includes actions that have no effect on the subscriber
    node.

### bdr.get_node_sub_apply_lsn

You can use this function on a subscriber to get the last LSN that was
received and applied from the given origin.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.get_node_sub_apply_lsn(node_name name)
```

#### Parameters

-   `node_name` &mdash; the name of the node that's the source of the
    replication stream whose LSN is being retrieved.

### bdr.run_on_all_nodes

Function to run a query on all nodes.

!!! Warning
    This function runs an arbitrary query on a remote node with the
    privileges of the user used for the internode connections as specified in the
    node's DSN. Use caution when granting privileges to this function.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.run_on_all_nodes(query text)
```

#### Parameters

-   `query` &mdash; Arbitrary query to execute.

#### Notes

This function connects to other nodes and executes the query, returning
a result from each of them in JSON format. Multiple rows might be returned from
each node, encoded as a JSON array. Any errors, such as being unable to
connect because a node is down, are shown in the response field.
No explicit statement_timeout or other runtime parameters are set, so
defaults are used.

This function doesn't go through normal replication. It uses direct client
connection to all known nodes. By default, the connection is created
with `bdr.ddl_replication = off`, since the commands are already being sent
to all of the nodes in the cluster.

Be careful when using this function since you risk breaking replication
and causing inconsistencies between nodes. Use either transparent DDL
replication or `bdr.replicate_ddl_command()` to replicate DDL.
DDL might be blocked in a future release.

#### Example

It's useful to use this function in monitoring, for example, as in the following
query:

```sql
SELECT bdr.run_on_all_nodes($$
	SELECT local_slot_name, origin_name, target_name, replay_lag_size
      FROM bdr.node_slots
     WHERE origin_name IS NOT NULL
$$);
```

This query returns something like this on a two-node cluster:

```
[
    {
        "dsn": "host=node1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres ",
        "node_id": "2232128708",
        "response": {
            "command_status": "SELECT 1",
            "command_tuples": [
                {
                    "origin_name": "node1",
                    "target_name": "node2",
                    "local_slot_name": "bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup_node2",
                    "replay_lag_size": "0 bytes"
                }
            ]
        },
        "node_name": "node1"
    },
    {
        "dsn": "host=node2 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres ",
        "node_id": "2058684375",
        "response": {
            "command_status": "SELECT 1",
            "command_tuples": [
                {
                    "origin_name": "node2",
                    "target_name": "node1",
                    "local_slot_name": "bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup_node1",
                    "replay_lag_size": "0 bytes"
                }
            ]
        },
        "node_name": "node2"
    }
]
```

### bdr.run_on_nodes

Function to run a query on a specified list of nodes.

!!! Warning
    This function runs an arbitrary query on remote nodes with the
    privileges of the user used for the internode connections as specified in the
    node's DSN. Use caution when granting privileges to this function.

#### Synopsis

```postgresql
bdr.run_on_nodes(node_names text[], query text)
```

#### Parameters

-   `node_names` &mdash; Text ARRAY of node names where query is executed.
-   `query` &mdash; Arbitrary query to execute.

#### Notes

This function connects to other nodes and executes the query, returning
a result from each of them in JSON format. Multiple rows can be returned from
each node, encoded as a JSON array. Any errors, such as being unable to
connect because a node is down, are shown in the response field.
No explicit statement_timeout or other runtime parameters are set, so
defaults are used.

This function doesn't go through normal replication. It uses direct client
connection to all known nodes. By default, the connection is created
with `bdr.ddl_replication = off`, since the commands are already being sent
to all of the nodes in the cluster.

Be careful when using this function since you risk breaking replication
and causing inconsistencies between nodes. Use either transparent DDL
replication or `bdr.replicate_ddl_command()` to replicate DDL.
DDL might be blocked in a future release.

### bdr.run_on_group

Function to run a query on a group of nodes.

!!! Warning
    This function runs an arbitrary query on remote nodes with the
    privileges of the user used for the internode connections as specified in the
    node's DSN. Use caution when granting privileges to this function.

#### Synopsis

```postgresql
bdr.run_on_group(node_group_name text, query text)
```

#### Parameters

-   `node_group_name` &mdash; Name of node group where query is executed.
-   `query` &mdash; Arbitrary query to execute.

#### Notes

This function connects to other nodes and executes the query, returning
a result from each of them in JSON format. Multiple rows can be returned from
each node, encoded as a JSON array. Any errors, such as being unable to
connect because a node is down, are shown in the response field.
No explicit statement_timeout or other runtime parameters are set, so
defaults are used.

This function doesn't go through normal replication. It uses direct client
connection to all known nodes. By default, the connection is created
with `bdr.ddl_replication = off`, since the commands are already being sent
to all of the nodes in the cluster.

Be careful when using this function since you risk breaking replication
and causing inconsistencies between nodes. Use either transparent DDL
replication or `bdr.replicate_ddl_command()` to replicate DDL.
DDL might be blocked in a future release.

### bdr.global_lock_table

This function acquires a global DML locks on a given table.
See [DDL locking details](ddl#ddl-locking-details) for information
about global DML lock.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.global_lock_table(relation regclass)
```

#### Parameters

-   `relation` &mdash; Name or oid of the relation to lock.

#### Notes

This function acquires the global DML lock independently of the
`ddl_locking` setting.

The `bdr.global_lock_table` function requires `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, or `TRUNCATE`
privilege on the locked `relation` unless `bdr.backwards_compatibility` is
set to 30618 or lower.

### bdr.wait_for_xid_progress

You can use this function to wait for the given transaction (identified
by its XID) originated at the given node (identified by its node id)
to make enough progress on the cluster. The progress is defined as the
transaction being applied on a node and this node having seen all
other replication changes done before the transaction is applied.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.wait_for_xid_progress(origin_node_id oid, origin_topxid int4, allnodes boolean DEFAULT true)
```

#### Parameters

-   `origin_node_id` &mdash; Node id of the node where the transaction
    originated.

-   `origin_topxid` &mdash; XID of the transaction.

-   `allnodes` &mdash; If `true` then wait for the transaction to progress on
    all nodes. Otherwise wait only for the current node.

#### Notes

You can use the function only for those transactions that
replicated a DDL command because only those transactions are tracked
currently. If a wrong `origin_node_id` or `origin_topxid` is supplied,
the function might wait forever or until `statement_timeout` occurs.

### bdr.local_group_slot_name

Returns the name of the group slot on the local node.

#### Example

```sql
bdrdb=# SELECT bdr.local_group_slot_name();
 local_group_slot_name
-----------------------
 bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup
```

### bdr.node_group_type

Returns the type of the given node group. Returned value is the same as what
was passed to `bdr.create_node_group()` when the node group was created,
except `normal` is returned if the `node_group_type` was passed as NULL
when the group was created.

#### Example

```sql
bdrdb=# SELECT bdr.node_group_type('bdrgroup');
 node_group_type
-----------------
 normal
```

## Global advisory locks

PGD supports global advisory locks. These locks are similar to
the advisory locks available in PostgreSQL except that the
advisory locks supported by PGD are global. They follow semantics
similar to DDL locks. So an advisory lock is obtained by majority consensus and
can be used even if one or more nodes are down or lagging behind, as long
as a majority of all nodes can work together.

Currently only EXCLUSIVE locks are supported. So if another node or another
backend on the same node has already acquired the advisory lock on the object,
then other nodes or backends must wait for the lock to be released.

Advisory lock is transactional in nature. So the lock is automatically released
when the transaction ends unless it's explicitly released before the end of
the transaction. In this case, it becomes available as soon as it's released.
Session-level advisory locks aren't currently supported.

Global advisory locks are reentrant. So if the same resource is locked three
times, you must then unlock it three times for it to be released for use in other sessions.

### bdr.global_advisory_lock

This function acquires an EXCLUSIVE lock on the provided object. If the lock isn't
available, then it waits until the lock becomes available or the
`bdr.global_lock_timeout` is reached.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.global_advisory_lock(key bigint)
```

#### parameters

-   `key` &mdash; The object on which an advisory lock is acquired.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.global_advisory_lock(key1 integer, key2 integer)
```

#### parameters

-   `key1` &mdash; First part of the composite key.
-   `key2` &mdash; second part of the composite key.

### bdr.global_advisory_unlock

This function releases a previously acquired lock on the application-defined
source. The lock must have been obtained in the same transaction by
the application. Otherwise, an error is raised.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.global_advisory_unlock(key bigint)
```

#### Parameters

-   `key` &mdash; The object on which an advisory lock is acquired.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.global_advisory_unlock(key1 integer, key2 integer)
```

#### Parameters

-   `key1` &mdash; First part of the composite key.
-   `key2` &mdash; Second part of the composite key.

## Monitoring functions

These functions decode the consensus payloads to a more human-readable output.

Used primarily by the `bdr.global_consensus_journal_details` debug view.

### bdr.get_global_locks

This function shows information about global locks held on the local node.

Used to implement the `bdr.global_locks` view to provide a more detailed

used by the consensus protocol.

### bdr.msgb_deliver_message

Function for sending messages to another node's connection pooler,
used by the consensus protocol.

### bdr.peer_state_name

This function transforms the node state (`node_state`) into a textual
representation and is used mainly to implement the `bdr.node_summary` view.

### bdr.request_replay_progress_update

Requests the immediate writing of a 'replay progress update' Raft message.
It's used mainly for test purposes but can be also used to test if the
consensus mechanism is working.

### bdr.seq_nextval

Internal implementation of sequence increments.

Use this function instead of standard `nextval` in queries that
interact with [PGD global sequences](sequences/#pgd-global-sequences).

#### Notes

The following are also internal PGD sequence manipulation functions.
`bdr.seq_currval` and `bdr.sql_lastval` are used automatically.

### bdr.show_subscription_status

Retrieves information about the subscription status and is used mainly to
implement the `bdr.subscription_summary` view.

### bdr.get_node_conflict_resolvers

Displays a text string of all the conflict resolvers on the local node.

### bdr.reset_subscription_stats

Returns a Boolean result after resetting the statistics created by subscriptions,
as viewed by `bdr.stat_subscription`.

### bdr.reset_relation_stats

Returns a Boolean result after resetting the relation stats,
as viewed by `bdr.stat_relation`.

### bdr.pg_xact_origin

Returns origin id of a given transaction.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.pg_xact_origin(xmin xid)
```

#### Parameters

- `xid` &mdash; Transaction id whose origin is returned,

### bdr.difference_fix_origin_create

Creates a replication origin with a given name passed as an argument but adding a `bdr_` prefix.
It returns the internal id of the origin. This performs the same functionality
as `pg_replication_origin_create()`, except this requires `bdr_superuser`
rather than postgres superuser permissions.

#### Synopsis

### bdr.difference_fix_session_setup

Marks the current session as replaying from the current origin.
The function uses the pre-created `bdr_local_only_origin` local
replication origin implicitly for the session. It allows replay
progress to be reported and returns void. This function performs the
same functionality as `pg_replication_origin_session_setup()`
except that this function requires bdr_superuser rather than postgres
superuser permissions. The earlier form of the function,
`bdr.difference_fix_session_setup(text)`, was deprecated and will be
removed in upcoming releases.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.difference_fix_session_setup()
```

### bdr.difference_fix_session_reset

Marks the current session as not replaying from any origin, essentially
resetting the effect of `bdr.difference_fix_session_setup()`.
It returns void. This function has the same functionality as
`pg_replication_origin_session_reset()` except this function requires
bdr_superuser rather than postgres superuser permissions.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.difference_fix_session_reset()
```

### bdr.difference_fix_xact_set_avoid_conflict

Marks the current transaction as replaying a transaction that
committed at LSN '0/0' and timestamp '2000-01-01'. This function has
the same functionality as
`pg_replication_origin_xact_setup('0/0', '2000-01-01')`
except this requires bdr_superuser rather than postgres superuser
permissions.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.difference_fix_xact_set_avoid_conflict()
```

### bdr.resynchronize_table_from_node(node_name name, relation regclass)

Resynchronizes the relation from a remote node.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.resynchronize_table_from_node(node_name name, relation regclass)
```

#### Parameters

- `node_name` &mdash; The node from which to copy or resync the relation data.
- `relation` &mdash; The relation to copy from the remote node.

#### Notes

This function acquires a global DML lock on the relation, truncates the relation
locally, and copies data into it from the remote node.

The relation must exist on both nodes with the same name and definition.

The following are supported:
-  Resynchronizing partitioned tables with identical partition definitions
-  Resynchronizing partitioned table to nonpartitioned table and vice versa
-  Resynchronizing referenced tables by temporarily dropping and recreating
foreign key constraints

After running the function on a referenced table, if the referenced column
data no longer matches the referencing column values, it throws an error.
After resynchronizing the referencing table data, rerun the function.

Furthermore, it supports resynchronization of tables with generated columns by
computing the generated column values locally after copying the data from
remote node.

Currently, row_filters are ignored by this function.

The `bdr.resynchronize_table_from_node` function can be executed only by
the owner of the table, provided the owner has bdr_superuser privileges.

### bdr.consensus_kv_store

Stores value in the consistent KV Store.

Returns timestamp of the value expiration time. This depends on `ttl`. If `ttl`
is `NULL`, then this returns `infinity`. If the value was deleted, it
returns `-infinity`.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.consensus_kv_store(key text, value jsonb,
        prev_value jsonb DEFAULT NULL, ttl int DEFAULT NULL)
```

#### Parameters

- `key` &mdash; An arbitrary unique key to insert, update, or delete.
- `value` &mdash; JSON value to store. If NULL, any existing record is deleted.
- `prev_value` &mdash; If set, the write operation is done only if the current value
  is equal to `prev_value`.
- `ttl` &mdash; Time to live of the new value, in milliseconds.

#### Notes

This is an internal function, mainly used by HARP.

!!! Warning
    Don't use this function in user applications.

### bdr.consensus_kv_fetch

Fetch value from the consistent KV Store in JSON format.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.consensus_kv_fetch(IN key text) RETURNS jsonb
```

#### Parameters

- `key` &mdash; An arbitrary key to fetch.

#### Notes

This is an internal function, mainly used by HARP.

!!! Warning
    Don't use this function in user applications.


### bdr.alter_subscription_skip_changes_upto

Because logical replication can replicate across versions, doesn't replicate
global changes like roles, and can replicate selectively, sometimes the logical
replication apply process can encounter an error and stop applying changes.

Wherever possible, fix such problems by making changes to the
target side. `CREATE` any missing table that's blocking replication,
`CREATE` a needed role, `GRANT` a necessary permission, and so on. But occasionally a
problem can't be fixed that way and it might be necessary to skip entirely over a
transaction.
Changes are skipped as entire transactions&mdash;all or nothing. To decide where to
skip to, use log output to find the commit LSN, per the example that follows, or peek
the change stream with the logical decoding functions.

Unless a transaction made only one change, you often need to manually
apply the transaction's effects on the target side, so it's important to
save the problem transaction whenever possible, as shown in the examples that follow.

It's possible to skip over changes without
`bdr.alter_subscription_skip_changes_upto` by using
`pg_catalog.pg_logical_slot_get_binary_changes` to skip to the LSN of interest,
so this is a convenience function. It does do a faster skip, although it
might bypass some kinds of errors in logical decoding.

This function works only on disabled subscriptions.

The usual sequence of steps is:

1.  Identify the problem subscription and LSN of the problem commit.
1.  Disable the subscription.
1.  Save a copy of the transaction using `pg_catalog.pg_logical_slot_peek_changes` on the source node, if possible.
1.  `bdr.alter_subscription_skip_changes_upto` on the target node.
1.  Apply repaired or equivalent changes on the target manually, if necessary.
1.  Reenable the subscription.

!!! Warning
    It's easy to make problems worse when using this function. Don't
    do anything unless you're certain it's the only option.

#### Synopsis

```sql
  bdr.alter_subscription_skip_changes_upto(
    subname text,
    skip_upto_and_including pg_lsn
  );
```

#### Example

Apply of a transaction is failing with an error, and you've determined that
lower-impact fixes such as changes on the target side can't resolve this
issue. You determine that you must skip the transaction.

In the error logs, find the commit record LSN to skip to, as in this
example:

```
ERROR:  XX000: CONFLICT: target_table_missing; resolver skip_if_recently_dropped returned an error: table does not exist
CONTEXT:  during apply of INSERT from remote relation public.break_me in xact with commit-end lsn 0/300AC18 xid 131315
committs 2021-02-02 15:11:03.913792+01 (action #2) (effective sess origin id=2 lsn=0/300AC18)
while consuming 'I' message from receiver for subscription bdr_regression_bdrgroup_node1_node2 (id=2667578509)
on node node2 (id=3367056606) from upstream node node1 (id=1148549230, reporiginid=2)
```

In this portion of log, you have the information you need:
the_target_lsn: **0/300AC18**
the_subscription: **bdr_regression_bdrgroup_node1_node2**

Next, disable the subscription so the apply worker doesn't try to connect to the replication slot:

```sql
  SELECT bdr.alter_subscription_disable('the_subscription');
```

You can't skip only parts of the transaction: it's all or nothing. So
we strongly recommend that you save a record of it by copying it out on the
provider side first, using the subscription's slot name.

```sql
  \\copy (SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_logical_slot_peek_changes('the_slot_name',
      'the_target_lsn', NULL, 'min_proto_version', '1', 'max_proto_version', '1',
      'startup_params_format', '1', 'proto_format', 'json'))
   TO 'transaction_to_drop.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv);
```

This example is broken into multiple lines for readability,
but issue it in a single line. `\copy` doesn't
support multi-line commands.

You can skip the change by changing `peek` to `get`, but
`bdr....skip_changes_upto` does a faster skip that avoids decoding
and outputting all the data:

```sql
  SELECT bdr.alter_subscription_skip_changes_upto('subscription_name',
      'the_target_lsn');
```

You can apply the same changes (or repaired versions of them)
manually to the target node, using the dumped transaction contents as a guide.

Finally, reenable the subscription:

```sql
  SELECT bdr.alter_subscription_enable('the_subscription');
```

## Task Manager Functions

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.taskmgr_set_leader(node name, wait_for_completion boolean DEFAULT true);
```

Request the given `node` to be the task manager leader node. The leader
node is responsible for creating new tasks (currently only autopartition
makes use of this facility). A witness node, a logical standby or a
subscriber-only node can't become a leader. Such requests will fail with
an ERROR.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.taskmgr_get_last_completed_workitem();
```

Return the `id` of the last workitem successfully completed on all nodes in the
cluster.

### Check Taskmgr Status

Using the `bdr.taskmgr_work_queue_check_status` function, you can
see the status of the background workers that are doing their job to
generate and finish the tasks.

The status can be seen through these views:
`taskmgr_work_queue_local_status`
`taskmgr_work_queue_global_status`

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.taskmgr_work_queue_check_status(workid bigint
                           local boolean DEFAULT false);
```

#### Parameters

-   `workid` &mdash; The key of the task.
-   `local` &mdash; Check the local status only.

#### Notes

Taskmgr workers are always running in the background, even before the
`bdr.autopartition` function is called for the first time. If an invalid
`workid` is used, the function returns `unknown`. `In-progress` is the typical status.



### Alter node kind

PGD5 introduced a concept of Task Manager Leader node. The node is selected
automatically by PGD, but for upgraded clusters, its important to set the
`node_kind` properly for all nodes in the cluster. The user is expected to
do this manually after upgrading to the latest PGD version by calling
`bdr.alter_node_kind()` SQL function for each node.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_node_kind(node_name text,
                    node_kind text);
```

#### Parameters

-   `node_name` &mdash; Name of the node to change kind.
-   `node_kind` &mdash; Kind of the node, which can be one of: `data`, `standby`, `witness`, or `subscriber-only`.

### `bdr.bdr_track_commit_decision`

Save the transaction commit status in the shared memory hash table.
This is used by the upgrade scripts to transfer commit decisions
saved in bdr.node_pre_commit catalog to the shared memory hash table.
This will also be logged to the WAL and hence can be reloaded from
