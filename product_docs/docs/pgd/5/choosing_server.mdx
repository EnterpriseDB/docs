title: "Choosing a Postgres distribution"
---

EDB Postgres Distributed can be deployed with three different Postgres distributions: PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Extended Server, or EDB Postgres Advanced Server.  The availability of particular EDB Postgres Distributed features depends on which Postgres distribution is used. Therefore, it is essential to adopt the Postgres distribution best suited to your business needs. For example, if having the feature "Commit At Most Once (CAMO)" is mission critical to your use case, you should not adopt open source PostgreSQL because it does not have the core capabilities required to handle CAMO.

The following table lists features of EDB Postgres Distributed that are dependent on the Postgres distribution and version.
