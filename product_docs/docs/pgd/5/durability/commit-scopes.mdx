title: Commit scopes
---

Commit scopes give applications granular control about durability and consistency of EDB Postgres Distributed.

A commit scope is a named rule that describes the behavior of COMMIT replication. The actual behavior depends on whether a commit scope uses [group commit](group-commit), [Commit At Most Once](camo), [lag control](lag-control), or combination of these.

## Configuration

To use group commit, first define a commit scope, which determines the PGD nodes involved in the commit of a transaction. Once a scope is established, you can configure a transaction to use group commit as follows:

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL bdr.commit_scope = 'example_scope';
...
COMMIT;
```

You must set the commit scope before the transaction writes any data.

For this example, you might previously have defined the commit scope as:

```sql
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'example_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'example_bdr_group',
    rule := 'ANY 2 (example_bdr_group)' GROUP COMMIT,
    wait_for_ready := true
);
```

This example assumes a *node group* named `example_bdr_group` exists and includes at least two PGD nodes as members, either directly or in subgroups. Any transaction committed in the `example_scope` requires one extra confirmation from a PGD node in the group. Together with the origin node, this accounts for "ANY 2" nodes out of the group, on which the transaction is guaranteed to be visible and durable after the commit.

### Origin groups

Rules for commit scopes can depend on the node the transaction is committed on, that is, the node that acts as the origin for the transaction. To make this transparent for the application, PGD allows a commit scope to define different rules depending on where the transaction originates from.

For example, consider an EDB Postgres Distributed cluster with nodes spread across two data centers: a left and a right one. Assume the top-level PGD node group is called `top_group`. You can use the following commands to set up
subgroups and create a commit scope requiring all nodes in the local data center to confirm the transaction but only one node from the remote one:

```sql
-- create sub-groups
SELECT bdr.create_node_group(
    node_group_name := 'left_dc',
    parent_group_name := 'top_group',
    join_node_group := false
);
SELECT bdr.create_node_group(
    node_group_name := 'right_dc',
    parent_group_name := 'top_group',
    join_node_group := false
);

-- create a commit scope with individual rules
-- for each sub-group
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'example_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'left_dc',
    rule := 'ALL (left_dc) GROUP COMMIT AND ANY 1 (right_dc) GROUP COMMIT',
    wait_for_ready := true
);
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'example_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'right_dc',
    rule := 'ANY 1 (left_dc) GROUP COMMIT AND ALL (right_dc) GROUP COMMIT',
    wait_for_ready := true
);
```

Now, using the `example_scope` on any node that's part of `left_dc` uses the first scope. Using the same scope on a node that's part of `right_dc` uses the second scope. This is an effective way of creating an inverted scope without having to juggle scope names in the application.

Each group can also have a default commit scope specified using the `bdr.alter_node_group_option` admin interface.

Making the above scopes the default ones for all transactions originating on nodes in those groups looks like this:

```sql
SELECT bdr.alter_node_group_option(
  node_group_name := 'left_dc',
  config_key := 'default_commit_scope',
  config_value := 'example_scope'
);
SELECT bdr.alter_node_group_option(
  node_group_name := 'right_dc',
  config_key := 'default_commit_scope',
  config_value := 'example_scope'
);
```

### Confirmation levels

PGD nodes can send confirmations for a transaction at different times. In increasing levels of protection, from the perspective of the confirming node, these are:

- `received` &mdash; A remote PGD node confirms the transaction immediately after receiving it, prior to starting the local application.
- `replicated` &mdash; Confirms after applying changes of the transaction but before flushing them to disk.
- `durable` &mdash; Confirms the transaction after all of its changes are flushed to disk.
- `visible` (default) &mdash; Confirms the transaction after all of its changes are flushed to disk and it's visible to concurrent transactions.

In rules for commit scopes, you can append these confirmation levels to the node group definition in parentheses with `ON` as follows:

- `ANY 2 (right_dc) ON replicated`
- `ALL (left_dc) ON visible` (default)
- `ALL (left_dc) ON received AND ANY 1 (right_dc) ON durable`

## Reference

### Commit scope grammar

The grammar for commit scopes is composed as follows:

```
commit_scope:
    confirmation [AND ...]

commit_scope_operation:
    commit_scope_group [ ON { received|replicated|durable|visible } ] commit_scope_kind

commit_scope_group:
{ ANY num (node_group [, ...])
  | MAJORITY (node_group [, ...])
  | ALL (node_group [, ...]) }

commit_scope_kind:
{ GROUP COMMIT [ ( group_commit_parameter = value ) ] [ ABORT ON ( abort_on_parameter = value ) ]
  | CAMO [ DEGRADE ON ( degrade_on_parameter = value ) TO ASYNC ]
  | LAG CONTROL [ ( lag_control_parameter = value ) ] }
```

#### Parameters

* `node_group` &mdash; Name of a node group.
* `( group_commit_parameter = value )` &mdash; Options for group commit.
    * `transaction_tracking` (Boolean) &mdash; Specifies whether to track status of transaction.
    * `conflict_resolution` (enum) &mdash; Specifies how to handle conflicts. Possible values are `async`, meaning to resolve conflicts asynchronously during replication using the conflict resolution policy, or `eager` meaning that conflicts are resolved eagerly during COMMIT by aborting one of the conflicting transactions.
    * `commit_decision` (enum) &mdash; Specifies how the COMMIT decision is made. The value `group` means the `commit_scope_group` specification also affects the COMMIT decision, not just durability. The value `partner`  means the partner node decides whether transactions can be committed. This value is allowed only on 2 data node groups. The value `raft` means the COMMIT decision is done using Raft consensus independent of `commit_scope_group` consensus.
* `ABORT ON ( abort_on_parameter = value )` &mdash; Allows automatic transaction abort on timeout.
    * `timeout` (interval) &mdash; Timeout in milliseconds (accepts other units).
* `DEGRADE ON ( degrade_on_parameter = value )` &mdash; Allows degrading to asynchronous operation on timeout
    * `timeout` (interval) &mdash; Timeout in milliseconds (accepts other units) after which operation becomes asynchronous.
    * `require_write_lead` (Boolean) &mdash; Specifies whether the node must be a write lead to be able to switch to asynchronous mode.
* `( lag_control_parameter = value )` &mdash; Options for lag control:
    * `max_lag_size` (int) &mdash; Maximum allowed lag based on WAL bytes.
    * `max_lag_time` (interval) &mdash; Maximum allowed lag based on wall clock sampling.
    * `max_commit_delay` (interval) &mdash; Maximum delay that can be injected to commit to try to keep within the lag limits.

!!! Note
    `CAMO` commit scope kind is mostly syntactic sugar for `GROUP COMMIT (transaction_tracking = true, commit_decision = partner)` with additional `DEGRADE ON` clause. It's expected that `GROUP COMMIT` will eventually gain the `DEGRADE ON` clause as well, making `CAMO` syntax deprecated.

!!! Note
    While the grammar for `synchronous_standby_names` and commit scopes can look similar, the former doesn't account for the origin node, but the latter does. Therefore, for example `synchronous_standby_names = 'ANY 1 (..)'` is equivalent to a commit scope of `ANY 2 (...)`.  This choice makes reasoning about majority easier and reflects that the origin node also contributes to the durability and visibility of the transaction.

### Adding a commit scope rule

The function `bdr.add_commit_scope` creates a rule for the given commit scope name and origin node group. If the rule is the same for all nodes in the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster, invoking this function once for the top-level node group is enough to fully define the commit scope.

Alternatively, you can invoke it multiple times with the same `commit_scope_name` but different origin node groups and rules for commit scopes that vary depending on the origin of the transaction.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name NAME,
    origin_node_group NAME,
    rule TEXT
    wait_for_ready boolean DEFAULT true)
```

### Changing a commit scope rule

To change a specific rule for a single origin node group in a commit scope, you can use the function `bdr.alter_commit_scope`.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name NAME,
    origin_node_group NAME,
    rule TEXT)
```

### Removing a commit scope rule

You can use `bdr.remove_commit_scope` to drop a single rule in a commit scope. If you define multiple rules for the commit scope, you must invoke this function once per rule to fully remove the entire commit scope.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.remove_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name NAME,
    origin_node_group NAME)
```

!!! Note
    Removing a commit scope that's still used as default by a node group isn't allowed.
