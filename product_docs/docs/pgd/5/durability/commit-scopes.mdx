title: Commit Scopes
---

Commit Scopes give applications granular control about durability and
consistency of EDB Postgres Distributed.

A Commit Scope is a named rule that describes behavior of COMMIT replication.
The actual behavior depends on whether a Commit Scope uses
[Group Commit](group-commit), [Commit At Most Once](camo),
[Lag Control](lag-control) or combination of these.

## Configuration

To use Group Commit, first define a commit scope. This
determines the BDR nodes involved in the commit of a transaction.
Once a scope is established, you can configure a transaction to use
Group Commit as follows:

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL bdr.commit_scope = 'example_scope';
...
COMMIT;
```

The commit scope must be set before the transaction has written any data.

For this example, you might previously have defined the commit scope as:

```sql
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'example_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'example_bdr_group',
    rule := 'ANY 2 (example_bdr_group)'
);
```

This assumes a *node group* named `example_bdr_group` exists and
includes at least two BDR nodes as members, either directly or in
subgroups. Any transaction committed in the `example_scope`
requires one extra confirmation from a BDR node in the group.
Together with the origin node, this accounts for "ANY 2" nodes out of
the group, on which the transaction is guaranteed to be visible and
durable after the commit.

### Origin groups

Rules for commit scopes can depend on the node the transaction is
committed on, that is, the node that acts as the origin for the transaction.
To make this transparent for the application, BDR allows a commit
scope to define different rules depending on where the transaction
originates from.

For example, consider a EDB Postgres Distributed cluster with nodes
spread across two data centers: a left and a right one.
Assume the top-level BDR node group
is called `top_group`. You can use the following commands to set up
subgroups and create a commit scope requiring all nodes in the local
data center to confirm the transaction but only one node from the
remote one.

```sql
-- create sub-groups
SELECT bdr.create_node_group(
    node_group_name := 'left_dc',
    parent_group_name := 'top_group',
    join_node_group := false
);
SELECT bdr.create_node_group(
    node_group_name := 'right_dc',
    parent_group_name := 'top_group',
    join_node_group := false
);

-- create a commit scope with individual rules
-- for each sub-group
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'example_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'left_dc',
    rule := 'ALL (left_dc) AND ANY 1 (right_dc)'
);
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'example_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'right_dc',
    rule := 'ANY 1 (left_dc) AND ALL (right_dc)'
);
```

Now using the `example_scope` on any node that's part of `left_dc` will use the
first scope, while using same scope on node that's part of `right_dc` will
use the second scope. This is effective way of creating inverted scope without
having to juggle scope names in application.

In addition to this, each group can also have default commit scope specified using
`bdr.alter_node_group_option` admin interface.

So making the above scopes the default ones for all transactions originatin on
nodes withing those groups would look like this.

```sql
SELECT bdr.alter_node_group_option(
  node_group_name := 'left_dc',
  config_key := 'default_commit_scope',
  config_value := 'example_scope'
);
SELECT bdr.alter_node_group_option(
  node_group_name := 'right_dc',
  config_key := 'default_commit_scope',
  config_value := 'example_scope'
);
```

### Confirmation levels

BDR nodes can send confirmations for a transaction at different points
in time. In increasing levels of protection, from the perspective of the
confirming node, these are:

* `received` &mdash; A remote BDR node confirms the transaction immediately
  after receiving it, prior to starting the local application.
* `replicated` &mdash; Confirm after applying changes of the transaction
  but before flushing them to disk.
* `durable` &mdash; Confirm the transaction after all of its changes are
  flushed to disk.
* `visible` (default) &mdash; Confirm the transaction after all of its
  changes are flushed to disk and it's visible to
  concurrent transactions.

In rules for commit scopes, you can append these confirmation levels
to the node group definition in parenthesis with `ON` as follows:

* `ANY 2 (right_dc) ON replicated`
* `ALL (left_dc) ON visible` (default and may as well be omitted)
* `ALL (left_dc) ON received AND ANY 1 (right_dc) ON durable`

## Reference

### Commit scope grammar

For reference, the grammar for commit scopes is composed as follows:

```
commit_scope:
    confirmation [AND ...]

commit_scope_operation:
    commit_scope_group [ ON { received|replicated|durable|visible } ] commit_scope_kind

commit_scope_group:
{ ANY num (node_group [, ...])
  | MAJORITY (node_group [, ...])
  | ALL (node_group [, ...]) }

commit_scope_kind:
{ GROUP_COMMIT [ ( group_commit_parameter = value ) ] [ ABORT ON ( abort_on_parameter = value ) ]
  | CAMO [ DEGRADE ON ( degrade_on_parameter = value ) TO ASYNC ]
  | LAG_CONTROL [ ( lag_control_parameter = value ) ] }
```

#### Parameters

* `node_group` - name of a node group
* `( group_commit_parameter = value )` - options for Group Commit
    * `transaction_tracking` (boolean) - specifies whether status of
       transaction should be tracked
    * `conflict_resolution` (enum) - how to handle conflicts, possible values
       are either `async` meaning conflicts should be resolved asynchronously
       after during replication using the conflict resolution policy or `eager`
       meaning that conflicts are resolved eagerly during COMMIT by aborting
       one of the conflicting transactions
    * `commit_decision` (enum) - how is COMMIT decision made, it can be either
      `group` meaning the `commit_scope_group` specification also affects the
      COMMIT decision, not just durability, it can also be `partner` which means
      partner node decides whether transaction can be committed (this is only
      allowed on 2 data node groups) or it can be `raft` which means COMMIT
      decision is done using Raft consensus independently of `commit_scope_group`
      consensus.
* `ABORT ON ( abort_on_parameter = value )` - allows automatic transaction
  abort on timeout
    * `timeout` (interval) - timeout in milliseconds (accepts other units)
* `DEGRADE ON ( degrade_on_parameter = value )` - allows degrading to asynchronous
  operation on timeout
    * `timeout` (interval) - timeout in milliseconds (accepts other units) after
      which operation becomes asynchronous
    * `require_write_lead` (boolean) - whether the node has to be a write lead to
      to be able to switch to asynchronous mode
* `( lag_control_parameter = value )` - options for Lag Control
    * `max_lag_size` (int) - maximum allowed lag based on WAL bytes
    * `max_lag_time` (interval) - maximum allowed lag based on wall clock sampling
    * `max_commit_delay` (interval) - maximum delay that can be injected to
      commit in order to try to keep within the lag limits

!!! Note
    `CAMO` commit scope kind is mostly syntax sugar for
    `GROUP_COMMIT (transaction_tracking = true, commit_decision = partner)` with
    additional `DEGRADE ON` clause. It's expected that `GROUP_COMMIT` will
    eventually gain `DEGRADE ON` clause as well, making `CAMO` syntax deprecated.

!!! Note
    While the grammar for `synchronous_standby_names` and Commit
    Scopes can loo very similar, it is important to note that the former
    does not account for the origin node, but the latter does.
    Therefore, for example `synchronous_standby_names = 'ANY 1 (..)'`
    is equivalent to a Commit Scope of `ANY 2 (...)`.  This choice
    makes reasoning about majority easier and reflects that the origin
    node also contributes to the durability and visibility of the
    transaction.

### Adding a commit scope rule

The function `bdr.add_commit_scope` creates a rule for the given
commit scope name and origin node group. If the rule is the same for
all nodes in the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster, invoking this function once for the
top-level node group is enough to fully define the commit scope.

Alternatively, you can invoke it multiple times with the same
`commit_scope_name` but different origin node groups and rules for
commit scopes that vary depending on the origin of the transaction.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name NAME,
    origin_node_group NAME,
    rule TEXT)
```

### Changing a commit scope rule

To change a specific rule for a single origin node group in a
commit scope, you can use the function `bdr.alter_commit_scope`.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name NAME,
    origin_node_group NAME,
    rule TEXT)
```

### Removing a commit scope rule

You can use `bdr.remove_commit_scope` to drop a single rule in
a commit scope. If you define multiple rules for the commit scope, you must invoke
this function once per rule to fully remove the entire
commit scope.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.remove_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name NAME,
    origin_node_group NAME)
```

!!! Note
    Removing a commit scope that is still used as default by a node
    group is not allowed
