navTitle: Commit At Most Once
title: Commit At Most Once
---

The objective of the Commit At Most Once (CAMO) feature is to prevent
the application from committing more than once.

Without CAMO, when a client loses connection after a COMMIT is
submitted, the application might not receive a reply from the server
and is therefore unsure whether the transaction committed.

The application can't easily decide between the two options of:

*  Retrying the transaction with the same data, since this can in some cases
   cause the data to be entered twice

*  Not retrying the transaction and risk that the data doesn't get
   processed at all

Either of those is a critical error with high-value data.

One way to avoid this situation is to make sure that the transaction
includes at least one `INSERT` into a table with a unique index, but
that depends on the application design and requires application-
specific error-handling logic, so it isn't effective in all cases.

The CAMO feature in PGD offers a more general solution and doesn't require
an `INSERT`. When activated by `bdr.commit_scope`, the application
receives a message containing the transaction identifier, if already
assigned. Otherwise, the first write statement in a transaction
sends that information to the client.

If the application sends an explicit COMMIT, the protocol ensures that the
application receives the notification of the transaction identifier before the
COMMIT is sent. If the server doesn't reply to the COMMIT, the application can
handle this error by using the transaction identifier to request
the final status of the transaction from another PGD node.
If the prior transaction status is known, then the application can safely
decide whether to retry the transaction.

CAMO works by creating a pair of partner nodes that are two PGD nodes
from the same PGD group. In this operation mode, each node in the pair knows
the outcome of any recent transaction executed on the other peer and especially
(for our need) knows the outcome of any transaction disconnected during COMMIT.
The node that receives the transactions from the application might be referred
to as "origin" and the node that confirms these transactions as "partner."
However, there's no difference in the CAMO configuration for the nodes in the
CAMO pair. The pair is symmetric.

!!! Warning
    CAMO requires changes to the user's application to take advantage of the
    advanced error handling. Enabling a parameter isn't enough to gain
    protection. Reference client implementations are provided to customers
    on request.

## Requirements

To use CAMO, an application must issue an explicit COMMIT message
as a separate request (not as part of a multi-statement request).
CAMO can't provide status for transactions issued from procedures
or from single-statement transactions that use implicit commits.

## Configuration

Configuration of CAMO happens through [Commit Scopes](commits-scopes).

## Failure scenarios

Different failure scenarios occur in different
configurations.

### Data persistence at receiver side

By default, a PGL writer operates in
`bdr.synchronous_commit = off` mode when applying transactions
from remote nodes. This holds true for CAMO as well, meaning that
transactions are confirmed to the origin node possibly before reaching
the disk of the CAMO partner. In case of a crash or hardware failure,
it is possible for a confirmed transaction to be unrecoverable on the
CAMO partner by itself. This isn't an issue as long as the CAMO
origin node remains operational, as it redistributes the
transaction once the CAMO partner node recovers.

This in turn means CAMO can protect against a single-node failure,
which is correct for local mode as well as or even in combination
with remote write.

To cover an outage of both nodes of a CAMO pair, you can use
`bdr.synchronous_commit = local` to enforce a flush prior to the
pre-commit confirmation. This doesn't work with
either remote write or local mode and has a performance
impact due to I/O requirements on the CAMO partner in the
latency sensitive commit path.

### Asynchronous mode

When `DEGRADE ON ... TO ASYNC` clause is used in the commit scope
a node detects whether its CAMO partner is ready. If not, it temporarily
switches to asynchronous (local) mode. When in this mode, a node commits
transactions locally until switching back to CAMO mode.

This doesn't allow COMMIT status to be retrieved, but it does
let you choose availability over consistency. This mode
can tolerate a single-node failure. In case both nodes of a CAMO pair
fail, they might choose incongruent commit decisions to maintain
availability, leading to data inconsistencies.

For a CAMO partner to switch to ready, it needs to be connected, and
the estimated catchup interval needs to drop below
the `timeout` value of `TO ASYNC`. The current readiness status of a CAMO
partner can be checked with `bdr.is_camo_partner_ready`, while
`bdr.node_replication_rates` provides the current estimate of the catchup
time.

The switch from CAMO protected to asynchronous mode is only ever triggered by
an actual CAMO transaction either because the commit exceeds the
`timeout` value of `TO ASYNC` or, in case the CAMO partner is already
known, disconnected at the time of commit. This switch is independent
of the estimated catchup interval. If the CAMO pair is configured to
require the current node to be the write lead of a group as configured
through `enable_proxy_routing` node group option. See
[Commit Scopes](commit-scopes) syntax.
This can prevent a split brain situation due to an isolated node from
switching to asynchronous mode. If `enable_proxy_routing` isn't set for the
CAMO group, the origin node switches to asynchronous mode immediately.

The switch from asynchronous mode to CAMO mode depends on the CAMO partner
node, which initiates the connection. The CAMO partner tries to
reconnect at least every 30 seconds. After connectivity is
reestablished, it might therefore take up to 30 seconds until the CAMO
partner connects back to its origin node. Any lag that accumulated on
the CAMO partner further delays the switch back to CAMO protected
mode.

Unlike during normal CAMO operation, in asynchronous mode there's no
additional commit overhead. This can be problematic, as it allows the
node to continuously process more transactions than the CAMO
pair can normally process. Even if the CAMO partner eventually
reconnects and applies transactions, its lag only ever increases
in such a situation, preventing reestablishing the CAMO protection.
To artificially throttle transactional throughput, PGD provides the
`bdr.camo_local_mode_delay` setting, which allows you to delay a COMMIT in
local mode by an arbitrary amount of time. We recommend measuring
commit times in normal CAMO mode during expected workloads and
configuring this delay accordingly. The default is 5 ms, which reflects
a asynchronous network and a relatively quick CAMO partner response.

Consider the choice of whether to allow asynchronous mode in view of
the architecture and the availability requirements. The following examples
provide some detail.

### Example

This example considers a setup with two PGD nodes that are the
CAMO partner of each other.

#### With asynchronous mode

If asynchronous mode is allowed, there's no single point of failure. When one
node fails:

* The other node can determine the status of all transactions that
  were disconnected during COMMIT on the failed node.
* New write transactions are allowed:
	* If the second node also fails, then the outcome of those
	  transactions that were being committed at that time is
	  unknown.

#### Without asynchronous mode

If asynchronous mode isn't allowed, then each node requires the other node
for committing transactions, that is, each node is a single point of
failure. When one node fails:

* The other node can determine the status of all transactions that
  were disconnected during COMMIT on the failed node.
* New write transactions are prevented until the node recovers.

## Application use

### Overview and requirements

CAMO relies on a retry loop and specific error handling
on the client side. There are three aspects to it:

* The result of a transaction's COMMIT needs to be checked and, in
  case of a temporary error, the client must retry the transaction.
* Prior to COMMIT, the client must retrieve a global
  identifier for the transaction, consisting of a node id and a
  transaction id (both 32-bit integers).
* If the current server fails while attempting a COMMIT of a transaction,
  the application must connect to its CAMO partner, retrieve the status
  of that transaction, and retry depending on the response.

The application must store the global transaction
identifier only for the purpose of verifying the transaction status in
case of disconnection during COMMIT. In particular, the application
doesn't need an additional persistence layer. If the application
fails, it needs only the information in the database to restart.

### CAMO partner connection status

The function `bdr.is_camo_partner_connected` allows checking the
connection status of a CAMO partner node configured in pair mode.
There currently is no equivalent for CAMO used with
Eager Replication.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.is_camo_partner_connected()
```

#### Return value

A Boolean value indicating whether the CAMO partner is currently
connected to a WAL sender process on the local node and therefore can
receive transactional data and send back confirmations.

### CAMO partner readiness

The function `bdr.is_camo_partner_ready` allows checking the readiness
status of a CAMO partner node configured in pair mode. Underneath,
this triggers the switch to and from local mode.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.is_camo_partner_ready()
```

#### Return value

A Boolean value indicating whether the CAMO partner can reasonably be
expected to confirm transactions originating from the local node in a
timely manner (before `timeout` for `TO ASYNC` expires).

!!! Note
    This function queries the past or current state. A
    positive return value doesn't indicate whether the CAMO partner can
    confirm future transactions.

### Fetch the CAMO partner

This function shows the local node's CAMO partner (configured by pair
mode).

```sql
bdr.get_configured_camo_partner()
```

### Wait for consumption of the apply queue from the CAMO partner

The function `bdr.wait_for_camo_partner_queue` is a wrapper of
`bdr.wait_for_apply_queue` defaulting to query the CAMO partner node.
It yields an error if the local node isn't part of a CAMO pair.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.wait_for_camo_partner_queue()
```

### Transaction status between CAMO nodes

This function enables a wait for CAMO transactions to be fully resolved.

```sql
bdr.camo_transactions_resolved()
```

### Transaction status query function

To check the status of a transaction that was being committed when the node
failed, the application must use this function:

```sql
bdr.logical_transaction_status(node_id OID, xid OID,
                               require_camo_partner boolean)
```

With CAMO used in pair mode, use this function only on
a node that's part of a CAMO pair. Along with Eager
replication, you can use it on all nodes.

In both cases, you must call the function within 15 minutes after
the commit was issued. The CAMO partner must regularly purge
such meta-information and therefore can't provide correct answers for
older transactions.

Before querying the status of a transaction, this function waits for
the receive queue to be consumed and fully applied. This prevents
early negative answers for transactions that were
received but not yet applied.

Despite its name, it's not always a read-only operation.
If the status is unknown, the CAMO partner decides whether to
commit or abort the transaction, storing that decision locally to
ensure consistency going forward.

The client must not call this function before
attempting to commit on the origin. Otherwise the transaction might be
forced to roll back.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.logical_transaction_status(node_id OID, xid OID,
                               require_camo_partner boolean DEFAULT true)
```

#### Parameters

- `node_id` &mdash; The node id of the PGD node the transaction originates
  from, usually retrieved by the client before COMMIT from the PQ
  parameter `bdr.local_node_id`.
- `xid` &mdash; The transaction id on the origin node, usually retrieved by
  the client before COMMIT from the PQ parameter `transaction_id`
- `require_camo_partner` &mdash; Defaults to true and enables configuration
  checks. Set to false to disable these checks and query the
  status of a transaction that was not a CAMO transaction.

#### Return value

The function returns one of these results:

- `'committed'::TEXT` &mdash; The transaction was committed, is visible
  on both nodes of the CAMO pair, and will eventually be replicated to
  all other PGD nodes. No need for the client to retry it.

- `'aborted'::TEXT` &mdash; The transaction was aborted and will not be
  replicated to any other PGD node. The client needs to either
  retry it or escalate the failure to commit the transaction.

- `'in progress'::TEXT` &mdash; The transaction is still in progress on this
  local node and wasn't committed or aborted yet. The transaction might be in the COMMIT phase, waiting for
  the CAMO partner to confirm or deny the commit. The recommended
  client reaction is to disconnect from the origin node and reconnect
  to the CAMO partner to query that instead. With a load balancer or proxy
  in between, where the client lacks control over which node gets
  queried, the client can only poll repeatedly until the status
  switches to either `'committed'` or `'aborted'`.

  For Eager All-Node Replication, peer nodes yield this result for
  transactions that aren't yet committed or aborted. This means that
  even transactions not yet replicated (or not even started on the
  origin node) might yield an `in progress` result on a peer PGD node in
  this case. However, the client must not query the transaction
  status prior to attempting to commit on the origin.

- `'unknown'::TEXT` &mdash; The transaction specified is unknown, either
  because it's in the future, not replicated to that specific node
  yet, or too far in the past. The status of such a transaction is
  not yet or no longer known. This return value is a sign of improper
  use by the client.

The client must be prepared to retry the function call on error.

### Connection pools and proxies

The effect of connection pools and proxies needs to be considered when
designing a CAMO cluster. A proxy may freely distribute transactions
to all nodes in the commit group (i.e. to both nodes of a CAMO pair or
to all PGD nodes in case of Eager All Node Replication).

Care needs to be taken to ensure that the application fetches
the proper node id: when using session pooling, the client remains
connected to the same node, so the node id remains constant for the
lifetime of the client session. However, with finer-grained transaction
pooling, the client needs to fetch the node id for every transaction (as
in the example given below).

A client that is not directly connected to the PGD nodes might not even
notice a failover or switchover, but can always use the
`bdr.local_node_id` parameter to determine which node it is currently
connected to. In the crucial situation of a disconnect during COMMIT,
the proxy must properly forward that disconnect as an error to the
client applying the CAMO protocol.

For CAMO in `received` mode, a proxy that potentially switches
between the CAMO pairs must use the `bdr.wait_for_camo_partner_queue`
function to prevent stale reads.

### Example

The following example demonstrates what a retry loop of a CAMO aware
client application should look like in C-like pseudo-code. It expects
two DSNs `origin_dsn` and `partner_dsn` providing connection information.
These usually are the same DSNs as used for the initial call to
`bdr.create_node`, and can be looked up in `bdr.node_summary`, column
`interface_connstr`.

```shell
PGconn *conn = PQconnectdb(origin_dsn);

loop {
    // start a transaction
    PQexec(conn, "BEGIN");

    // apply transactional changes
    PQexec(conn, "INSERT INTO ...");
    ...

    // store a globally unique transaction identifier
    node_id = PQparameterStatus(conn, "bdr.local_node_id");
    xid = PQparameterStatus(conn, "transaction_id");

    // attempt to commit
    PQexec(conn, "COMMIT");
    if (PQresultStatus(res) == PGRES_COMMAND_OK)
        return SUCCESS;
    else if (PQstatus(res) == CONNECTION_BAD)
    {
        // Re-connect to the partner
        conn = PQconnectdb(partner_dsn);
        // Check if successfully reconnected
        if (!connectionEstablished())
            panic();

        // Check the attempted transaction's status
        sql = "SELECT bdr.logical_transaction_status($node_id, $xid)";
        txn_status = PQexec(conn, sql);
        if (txn_status == "committed")
            return SUCCESS;
        else
            continue;   // to retry the transaction on the partner
    }
    else
    {
        // The connection is intact, but the transaction failed for some
        // other reason.  Differentiate between permanent and temporary
        // errors.
        if (isPermanentError())
            return FAILURE;
        else
        {
            // Determine an appropriate delay to back-off to account for
            // temporary failures due to congestion, so as to decrease
            // the overall load put on the servers.
            sleep(increasing_retry_delay);

            continue;
        }
    }
}
```

This example needs to be extended with proper logic for connecting, including
retries and error handling. If using a load balancer
(e.g. PgBouncer), re-connecting can be implemented by simply using
`PQreset`. Ensure that the load balancer only
ever redirects a client to a CAMO partner and not any other PGD node.

In practice, an upper limit of retries is recommended. Depending on the
actions performed in the transaction, other temporary errors may be
possible and need to be handled by retrying the transaction depending
on the error code, similarly to the best practices on deadlocks or on
serialization failures while in `SERIALIZABLE` isolation mode.

## Interaction with DDL and global locks

Transactions protected by CAMO can contain DDL operations. However, DDL uses global locks, which already provide some
synchronization among nodes. See
[DDL locking details](/pgd/latest/bdr/ddl#ddl-locking-details) for more
information.

Combining CAMO with DDL imposes a higher latency and also
increases the chance of global deadlocks. We therefore recommend using a
relatively low `bdr.global_lock_timeout`, which aborts the DDL and
therefore resolves a deadlock in a reasonable amount of time.

### Nontransactional DDL

The following DDL operations aren't allowed in a transaction
block and therefore can't benefit from CAMO protection. For
these, CAMO is automatically disabled internally:

* all concurrent index operations (`CREATE`, `DROP`, and `REINDEX`)
* `REINDEX DATABASE`, `REINDEX SCHEMA`, and `REINDEX SYSTEM`
* `VACUUM`
* `CLUSTER` without any parameter
* `ALTER TABLE DETACH PARTITION CONCURRENTLY`
* `ALTER TYPE [enum] ADD VALUE`
* `ALTER SYSTEM`
* `CREATE` and `DROP DATABASE`
* `CREATE` and `DROP TABLESPACE`
* `ALTER DATABASE [db] TABLESPACE`

## CAMO limitations

-  CAMO is designed to query the results of a recently failed COMMIT on
the origin node, so in case of disconnection, code the application
to immediately request the transaction status from the CAMO partner.
Have as little delay as possible after the failure before
requesting the status. Applications must not rely on CAMO decisions
being stored for longer than 15 minutes.

-  If the application forgets the global identifier assigned, for example
as a result of a restart, there's no easy way to recover
it. Therefore, we recommend that applications wait for outstanding
transactions to end before shutting down.

-  For the client to apply proper checks, a transaction protected by CAMO
can't be a single statement with implicit transaction control. You also can't
use CAMO with a transaction-controlling procedure or
in a `DO` block that tries to start or end transactions.

- CAMO resolves commit status but doesn't yet resolve pending
notifications on commit. CAMO and Eager replication options don't
allow the `NOTIFY` SQL command or the `pg_notify()` function.
They also don't allow `LISTEN` or `UNLISTEN`.

- When replaying changes, CAMO transactions may detect conflicts just
the same as other transactions. If timestamp conflict detection is used,
the CAMO transaction uses the timestamp of the prepare on the origin
node, which is before the transaction becomes visible on the origin
node itself.

- CAMO is not currently compatible with transaction streaming. Please
ensure to disable transaction streaming when planning to use
CAMO. This can be configured globally or in the PGD node group, see
[Transaction Streaming Configuration](/pgd/latest/bdr/transaction-streaming#configuration).

## Performance implications

CAMO extends the Postgres replication protocol by adding a
message roundtrip at commit. Applications have a higher
commit latency than with asynchronous replication, mostly determined
by the roundtrip time between involved nodes. Increasing the number
of concurrent sessions can help to increase parallelism to
obtain reasonable transaction throughput.

The CAMO partner confirming transactions must store transaction
states. Compared to non-CAMO operation, this might require an
additional seek for each transaction applied from the origin.

## Client application testing

Proper use of CAMO on the client side isn't trivial. We strongly
recommend testing the application behavior with the PGD
cluster against failure scenarios such as node crashes or network
outages.
