The goal of group commit is to protect against data loss
in case of single node failures or temporary outages. You achieve this
by requiring more than one PGD node to successfully receive and
confirm a transaction at COMMIT time.

## Requirements

During normal operation, group commit is transparent to the
application. Transactions that were in progress during failover need the
reconciliation phase triggered or consolidated by either the application or a
proxy in between. This activity currently happens only when either the origin node
recovers or when it's parted from the cluster. This behavior is the same as with
Postgres legacy built-in synchronous replication.

Transactions committed with group commit use two-phase commit underneath.
Therefore, configure `max_prepared_transactions` high enough to handle all such
transactions originating per node.

## Configuration

To use group commit, first define a [commit scope](commit-scopes). The commit scope
determines the PGD nodes involved in the commit of a transaction.

## Behavior

The behavior of group commit depends on the configuration applied by the commit
scope.

### Commit decisions

You can configure group commit to decide commits in three different ways: `group`,
`partner`, and `raft`.

Group commit decision is done through the consensus specified using the same
commit scope group settings used for the durability purposes. The difference
is that the commit decision is made based on PREPARE replication while the
durability checks COMMIT (PREPARED) replication.

The partner decision is what [Commit At Most Once](camo) uses. This approach
works only when there are two data nodes in the node group. These two nodes are
partners of each other, and the replica rather than origin decides whether
to commit something. This approach requires application changes to use
the CAMO transaction protocol to work correctly, as the application is in some way
part of the consensus. For more on this approach, see [CAMO](camo).

The raft option uses the built-in Raft consensus to decide whether
commit can happen. Currently, the global Raft is used. For this to work, the majority
of nodes across the whole cluster must work.

### Conflict resolution

Conflict resolution can be `async` or `eager`.

Async means that PGD does optimistic conflict resolution during replication using the row-level resolution as configured for given node. This happens regardless of whether the origin transaction committed or is still in progress. See
[Conflicts](../consistency/conflicts) for details about
how the asynchronous conflict resolution works.

Eager means that conflicts are resolved eagerly (as part of agreement on COMMIT),
and conflicting transactions get aborted with a serialization error. This approach
provides greater isolation than the asynchronous resolution at the price of
performance. For the details about how eager conflict resolution works, see
[Eager conflict resolution](../consistency/eager).

### Aborts

To prevent a transaction that can't get consensus on the COMMIT from hanging
forever, the `ABORT ON` clause allows specifying timeout. After the timeout, the
transaction abort is requested. If the transaction is already
decided to be committed at the time the abort request is sent, the transaction
does eventually COMMIT even though the client might receive an abort message.

## Limitations

Group commit transactions can't yet execute DDL,
and they don't support explicit two-phase commit. Future releases might allow them.
However, the `TRUNCATE` command is allowed.

You can combine only CAMO transactions with the `DEGRADE TO` clause for switching
to asynchronous operation in case of lowered availability.

Eager and CAMO transactions aren't currently supported in combination
with the Decoding Worker feature or with transaction streaming.
Installations using eager must keep `enable_wal_decoder` and `streaming_mode`
disabled for the PGD node group.

Synchronous replication uses a mechanism for transaction confirmation
different from group commit. The two aren't compatible, and you must not use
them together. Therefore, whenever you group commit transactions,
make sure none of the PGD nodes are configured in
`synchronous_standby_names`.

Currently, Raft commit decisions are extremely slow, producing very low TPS. We recommended 
using them only with the `eager` conflict resolution setting
to get the eager all-node replication behavior of PGD 4 and older.

Combining different commit decision options in the same transaction isn't
supported. Combining different conflict resolution options in the same transaction also isn't
supported.
