Commit scope kind: `GROUP COMMIT`

## Overview

The goal of Group Commit is to protect against data loss in case of single node
failures or temporary outages. You achieve this by requiring more than one PGD
node to successfully confirm a transaction at COMMIT time. Confirmation can be sent
at a number of points in the transaction processing, but defaults to "visible" when
the transaction has been flushed to disk and is visible to all other transactions.


## Example

```sql
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'example_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'left_dc',
    rule := 'ALL (left_dc) GROUP COMMIT(commit_decision=raft) AND ANY 1 (right_dc) GROUP COMMIT',
    wait_for_ready := true
);
```

This example creates a commit scope where all the nodes in the left_dc group and any one of the nodes in the right_dc group must receive and successfuly confirm a committed transaction.


## Requirements

During normal operation, Group Commit is transparent to the application.
Transactions that were in progress during failover need the reconciliation phase
triggered or consolidated by either the application or a proxy in between. This
activity currently happens only when either the origin node recovers or when
it's parted from the cluster. This behavior is the same as with Postgres legacy
built-in synchronous replication.

Transactions committed with Group Commit use [two-phase
commit](../terminology/#two-phase-commit-2pc) underneath. Therefore, configure
`max_prepared_transactions` high enough to handle all such transactions
originating per node.

## Limitations

See the Group Commit section of the [Limitations](limitations#group-commit) section.


## Configuration

To use Group Commit, first define a [commit scope](commit-scopes). The commit scope
determines the PGD nodes involved in the commit of a transaction.

## Behavior

The behavior of Group Commit depends on the configuration applied by the commit
scope.

### Commit decisions

You can configure Group Commit to decide commits in three different ways: `group`,
`partner`, and `raft`.

The `group` decision is the default. It specifies that the commit is confirmed
by the origin node upon it recieving as many confirmations as required by the
commit scope group. The difference is that the commit decision is made based on
PREPARE replication while the durability checks COMMIT (PREPARED) replication.

The `partner` decision is what [Commit At Most Once](camo) uses. This approach
works only when there are two data nodes in the node group. These two nodes are
partners of each other, and the replica rather than origin decides whether
to commit something. This approach requires application changes to use
the CAMO transaction protocol to work correctly, as the application is in some way
part of the consensus. For more on this approach, see [CAMO](camo).

The `raft` decision uses PGDs built-in raft consensus for commit decisions. It
can have low performance and is currently only required when using GROUP COMMIT
with an ALL commit scope group.

Using an ALL commit scope group requires that the commit decision must be set to
raft to avoid [reconciliation](#transaction-reconciliation) issues. 

### Conflict resolution

Conflict resolution can be `async` or `eager`.

Async means that PGD does optimistic conflict resolution during replication
using the row-level resolution as configured for given node. This happens
regardless of whether the origin transaction committed or is still in progress.
See [Conflicts](../consistency/conflicts) for details about how the asynchronous
conflict resolution works.

Eager means that conflicts are resolved eagerly (as part of agreement on
COMMIT), and conflicting transactions get aborted with a serialization error.
This approach provides greater isolation than the asynchronous resolution at the
price of performance. 

Using an ALL commit scope group requires that the [commit
decision](#commit-decisions) must be set to `raft` to avoid reconciliation
issues.

For the details about how Eager conflict resolution works,
see [Eager conflict resolution](../consistency/eager). 

### Aborts

To prevent a transaction that can't get consensus on the COMMIT from hanging
forever, the `ABORT ON` clause allows specifying timeout. After the timeout, the
transaction abort is requested. If the transaction is already
decided to be committed at the time the abort request is sent, the transaction
does eventually COMMIT even though the client might receive an abort message.

See also [Limitations](limitations). 

### Transaction Reconciliation

A group commit transactionâ€™s commit on the origin node is implicitly converted 
into a two step commit. 

In the first step the transaction is prepared locally and made ready to commit.
The data is made durable but uncomitted at this stage so other transactions
cannot see the changes made by this transaction. This prepared transaction gets
replicated to all remaining nodes via async replication. 

The origin node seeks confirmations from other nodes, as per rules in the group
commit grammar. If it gets confirmations from minimum required nodes in the
cluster, it decides to commit this transaction and also send this decision via
replication to other nodes which will also eventually commit on getting this
message. 

There is a possibility of failure at various stages. For example, the origin
node may crash after preparing the transaction. Or the origin and one or more
replicas may crash. 

This leaves the prepared transactions in the system. The `pg_prepared_xacts`
view in Postgres can show prepared transactions on a system. The prepared
transactions could be holding locks and other resources and they therefore need
to be either aborted or committed. That decision has to be made with a consensus
of nodes. 

When commit_decision is raft then, raft acts as the reconcilator and these
transactions are eventually, automatically, reconciled. 

But group commit transactions do not use raft and instead the write lead in the
cluster performs the role of reconciliator. This is because it is the node that
is most ahead with respect to changes in its sub-group. It detects when a node
is down and initiates reconciliation for such node by looking for prepared
transactions it may have with the down node as the origin. 

For all such transactions, it sees if the nodes as per the rules of the commit
scope have the prepared transaction, it takes a decision. This decision is
conveyed over raft and needs majority of the nodes to be up to do
reconciliation.

This process happens in the background and there is no user command needed to
control or issue this.
