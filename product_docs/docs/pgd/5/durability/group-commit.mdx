title: Group Commit
---

The goal of Group Commit is to protect against data loss
in case of single node failures or temporary outages. You achieve this
by requiring more than one BDR node to successfully receive and
confirm a transaction at COMMIT time.

## Requirements

During normal operation, Group Commit is completely transparent to the
application.  Transactions which were in progress during failover need the
reconciliation phase triggered or consolidated by either the application or a
proxy in between. This currently happens only when either the origin node
recovers or when it is parted from the cluster. This is the same as with
Postgres legacy builtin synchronous replication.

Transactions using committed with Group Commit use two-phase commit underneath.
Therefore, configure `max_prepared_transactions` high enough to handle all such
transactions originating per node.

## Configuration

To use Group Commit, first define a [Commit Scope](commit-scopes). This
determines the BDR nodes involved in the commit of a transaction.

## Behavior

The behavior of Group Commit depends on the configuration applied by the Commit
Scope.

### Commit decisions

Group Commit can be configured to decide commits in 3 different ways, `group`,
`partner` and `raft`.

Group commit decision is done through the consensus specified using the same
commit scope group settings used for the durability purposes. The difference
is that the commit decision is made based on PREPARE replication while the
durability checks COMMIT (PREPARED) replication.

The partner decision is what [Commit At Most Once](camo) uses. This approach
only works when there are 2 data nodes in the node group. These two nodes are
partners of each other, and the replica rather than origin decides whether
to commit something or not. This approach requires application changes to use
the CAMO transaction protocol to work correctly as application is in some way
part of the consensus. More on this approach in the [CAMO](camo) chapter.

Last option is raft, which uses the builtin Raft consensus to decide whether
commit can happen. Currently the global Raft is used so for this to work majority
of nodes across whole cluster must work.

### Conflict resolution

Conflict resolution can be either `async` or `eager`.

Async means that PGD does optimistic conflict resolution during replication
(regardless of whether the origin transaction committed or or is still in progress)
using the row level resolution as configured for given node. See
[Conflicts](/pgd/latest/consistency/conflicts) chapter for detailed description
of how the asynchronous conflict resolution works.

Eager means that conflicts are resolved eagerly (as part of agreement on COMMIT)
and conflicting transactions get aborted with serialization error. This approach
provides greater isolation than the asynchronous resolution at the price of
performance. For the details of how Eager conflict resolution works, see
[Eager conflict resolution](/pgd/latest/consistency/eager).

### Aborts

To prevent transaction which cannot get consensus on the COMMIT from hanging
forever, the `ABORT ON` clause allows specifying timeout after which the
transaction abort is requested. Note that in case the transaction is already
decided to be committed at the time the abort request is sent, the transaction
will eventually COMMIT even though client might receive abort message.

## Limitations

Group Commit transactions can't yet execute DDL,
nor do they support explicit two-phase commit. These might be allowed in
later releases. However, the `TRUNCATE` command is allowed.

Only CAMO transactions can combined with `DEGRADE TO` clause for switching
to asynchronous operation on case of lowered availability yet.

Neither Eager or CAMO transactions are not currently supported in combination
with the Decoding Worker feature nor with transaction streaming.
Installations using Eager must keep `enable_wal_decoder` and `streaming_mode`
disabled for the BDR node group.

Synchronous replication uses a mechanism for transaction confirmation
different from Group Commit. The two aren't compatible, and you must not use
them together. Therefore, whenever Group Commit transactions,
make sure none of the BDR nodes are configured in
`synchronous_standby_names`.

Currently, Raft commit decisions are extremely slow producing very low TPS and
are only recommended to be used along with the `eager` conflict resolution setting
to get the Eager All-Node Replication behavior of PGD 4 and older.

Combining different commit decision options in the same transaction is not
supported.

Combining different conflict resolution options in the same transaction is not
supported.
