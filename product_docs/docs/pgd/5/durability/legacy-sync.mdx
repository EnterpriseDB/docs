!!! Warning Important
Consider using [Group Commit](group-commit) instead.
!!!

Postgres provides [physical streaming
replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/warm-standby.html#STREAMING-REPLICATION)
(PSR), which is unidirectional but offers a [synchronous
variant](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/warm-standby.html#SYNCHRONOUS-REPLICATION).

For backward compatibility, PGD still supports configuring synchronous
replication with `synchronous_commit` and `synchronous_standby_names`. See
[Legacy synchronous replication](#legacy-synchronous-replication-using-pgd), but
consider using [Group Commit](group-commit) instead.

Unlike PGD replication options, PSR sync will persist first, replicating after the WAL flush of commit record.



### Usage

To enable synchronous replication using PGD, you need to add the application
name of the relevant PGD peer nodes to `synchronous_standby_names`. The use of
`FIRST x` or `ANY x` offers some flexibility if this doesn't conflict with the
requirements of non-PGD standby nodes.

Once you've added it, you can configure the level of synchronization per
transaction using `synchronous_commit`, which defaults to `on`. This setting
means that adding the application name to to `synchronous_standby_names` already
enables synchronous replication. Setting `synchronous_commit` to `local` or
`off` turns off synchronous replication.

Due to PGD applying the transaction before persisting it, the values `on` and
`remote_apply` are equivalent for logical replication.

### Comparison

The following table summarizes what a client can expect from a peer node
replicated to after receiving a COMMIT confirmation from the origin node the
transaction was issued to. The Mode column takes on different meaning depending
on the variant. For PSR and legacy synchronous replication with PGD, it refers
to the `synchronous_commit` setting.

| Variant             | Mode                  | Received | Visible | Durable |
|---------------------|-----------------------|----------|---------|---------|
| PSR Async           | off (default)         | no       | no      | no      |
| PSR Sync            | remote_write (2)      | yes      | no      | no (3)  |
| PSR Sync            | on (2)                | yes      | no      | yes     |
| PSR Sync            | remote_apply (2)      | yes      | yes     | yes     |
| PGD Legacy Sync (1) | remote_write (2)      | yes      | no      | no      |
| PGD Legacy Sync (1) | on (2)                | yes      | yes     | yes     |
| PGD Legacy Sync (1) | remote_apply (2)      | yes      | yes     | yes     |

*(1) Consider using Group Commit instead.*

*(2) Unless switched to local mode (if allowed) by setting
`synchronous_replication_availability` to `async'`, otherwise the
values for the asynchronous PGD default apply.*

*(3) Written to the OS, durable if the OS remains running and only
Postgres crashes.*

### Postgres configuration parameters

The following table provides an overview of the configuration
settings that you must set to a non-default value (req) and those that are
optional (opt) but affecting a specific variant.

| Setting (GUC)                        | Group Commit | Lag Control |   PSR   | Legacy Sync |
|--------------------------------------|:------------:|:-----------:|:-------:|:-----------:|
| synchronous_standby_names            |     n/a      |     n/a     |   req   |     req     |
| synchronous_commit                   |     n/a      |     n/a     |   opt   |     opt     |
| synchronous_replication_availability |     n/a      |     n/a     |   opt   |     opt     |

### Migration to commit scopes

You configure the Group Commit feature of PGD independent of
`synchronous_commit` and `synchronous_standby_names`. Instead, the
`bdr.commit_scope` GUC allows you to select the scope per transaction. And
instead of configuring `synchronous_standby_names` on each node
individually, Group Commit uses globally synchronized commit scopes.

!!! Note
While the grammar for `synchronous_standby_names` and commit
scopes looks similar, the former
doesn't account for the origin node, but the latter does.
Therefore, for example, `synchronous_standby_names = 'ANY 1 (..)'`
is equivalent to a commit scope of `ANY 2 (...)`. This choice
makes reasoning about majority easier and reflects that the origin
node also contributes to the durability and visibility of the
transaction.
