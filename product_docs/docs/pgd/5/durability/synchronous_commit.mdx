Commit scope kind: `SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT`

## Overview

PGD's `SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT` is a commit scope kind that works in a way that is more like PostgreSQL's [Synchronous commit](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-SYNCHRONOUS-COMMIT) option in its underlying operation. Unlike the PostgreSQL option though, it is configured as a commit scope and is easier to configure and interact with within PGD. 

Unlike other commit scope kinds such as GROUP COMMIT and CAMO, the transactions in a SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT operation will not be transformed into a two phase commit (2PC) transaction, but work more like a Postgres Synchronous commit.

`SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT` is supported only by EDB Postgres Extended and EDB Postgres Advanced Server versions 14 or later.

## Example

```
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'example_sc_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'left_dc',
    rule := 'MAJORITY (left_dc) SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT',
    wait_for_ready := true
);
```

In this example, any node in the `left_dc` group, when this commit scope is in use, will use `SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT` to replicate changes to the other nodes in the `left_dc` group. It will look for a majority of nodes in the `left_dc` group to confirm that they have committed the transaction.

## Configuration

There are no parameters for `SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT` and therefore no configuration.

## Confirmation

   | Confirmation&nbsp;Level | PGD Synchronous Commit Handling                                                                                                                                                                        |
   |-------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | `received`              | A remote PGD node confirms the transaction once it's been fully received and is in in-memory write queue.                                                                                              |
   | `replicated`            | Same behavior as `received`.                                                                                                                                                                           |
   | `durable`               | Confirms the transaction after all of its changes are flushed to disk. Analogous to `synchronous_commit = on` in legacy synchronous replication.                                                       |
   | `visible` (default)     | Confirms the transaction after all of its changes are flushed to disk and it's visible to concurrent transactions. Analogous to `synchronous_commit = remote_apply` in legacy synchronous replication. |

## Details

SYNCHRONOUS_COMMIT works with EDB Postgres Advanced Server and EDB Postgres Extended versions 14 or later.
