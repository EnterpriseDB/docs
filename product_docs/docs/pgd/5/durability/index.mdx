## Overview

EDB Postgres Distributed allows you to choose from several replication
configurations based on your durability, consistency, availability, and
performance needs using *Commit Scopes*.

In it's basic configuration, EDB Postgres Distributed will use asynchronous
replication, however commit scopes can change both the default and the per
transaction behavior. It's also possible to configure the legacy Postgres
synchronous replication using standard `synchronous_standby_names` in a same
way as the built-in physical or logical replication. Commit scopes however
provide much more flexibility and control over the replication behavior.

The different synchronization settings affect three properties of interest
to applications that are related but can all be implemented individually:

-   *Durability*: Writing to multiple nodes increases crash resilience
    and allows you to recover the data after a crash and restart.
-   *Visibility*: With the commit confirmation to the client, the database
    guarantees immediate visibility of the committed transaction on some
    sets of nodes.
-   *Conflict handling*: Conflicts can be handled either optimistically
    post-commit, with conflicts being resolved when the transaction is replicated
    based on commit timestamps. Or they can be handled pessimistically
    pre-commit, where the client can rely on the transaction to eventually be
    applied on all nodes without further conflicts or get an abort directly
    informing the client of an error.

Commit Scopes allow two ways of controlling durability of the transaction:

-   [Group Commit](group-commit). This option controls which and how many nodes
    have to reach a consensus before we consider transaction to be committable
    and at what stage of replication we can consider it committed. This also
    allows controlling the visibility ordering of the transaction.
-   [CAMO](camo). Variant of Group Commit where the client is part of the
    consensus.
-   [Lag Control](lag-control). This option controls how far behind can nodes
    be in terms of replication before allowing commit to proceed.

Postgres provides [Physical Streaming Replication](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/warm-standby.html#STREAMING-REPLICATION)
(PSR), which is unidirectional but offers a [synchronous variant](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/warm-standby.html#SYNCHRONOUS-REPLICATION).
For backward compatibility, BDR still supports configuring synchronous
replication with `synchronous_commit` and `synchronous_standby_names`. See
[Legacy synchronous replication](#legacy-synchronous-replication-using-bdr),
but consider using [Group Commit](group-commit) instead.

## Terms and definitions

BDR nodes take different roles during the replication of a transaction.
These are implicitly assigned per transaction and are unrelated even for
concurrent transactions.

* The *origin* is the node that receives the transaction from the
  client or application. It's the node processing the transaction
  first, initiating replication to other BDR nodes, and responding back
  to the client with a confirmation or an error.

* A *partner* node is a BDR node expected to confirm transactions
  either according to Group Commit requirements.

* A *commit group* is the group of all BDR nodes involved in the
  commit, that is, the origin and all of its partner nodes, which can be
  just a few or all peer nodes.

## Comparison

Most options for synchronous replication available to
BDR allow for different levels of synchronization, offering different
tradeoffs between performance and protection against node or network
outages.

The following table summarizes what a client can expect from a peer
node replicated to after having received a COMMIT confirmation from
the origin node the transaction was issued to. The Mode column takes
on different meaning depending on the variant. For PSR and legacy
synchronous replication with BDR, it refers to the
`synchronous_commit` setting. And for Commit Scopes, it refers to the
confirmation requirements of the
[commit scope configuration](commit-scopes#configuration).

*(1) Written to the OS, durable if the OS remains running and only
Postgres crashes.*

*(2) Unless switched to local mode (if allowed) by setting
`synchronous_replication_availability` to `async'`, otherwise the
values for the asynchronous BDR default apply.*

*(3) Consider using Group Commit instead.*

Reception ensures the peer operating normally can
eventually apply the transaction without requiring any further
communication, even in the face of a full or partial network
outage. A crash of a peer node might still require retransmission of
the transaction, as this confirmation doesn't involve persistent
storage. All modes considered synchronous provide this protection.

Visibility implies the transaction was applied remotely. All other
clients see the results of the transaction on all nodes, providing
this guarantee immediately after the commit is confirmed by the origin
node. Without visibility, other clients connected might not see the
results of the transaction and experience stale reads.

Durability relates to the peer node's storage and provides protection
against loss of data after a crash and recovery of the peer node.
This can either relate to the reception of the data (as with physical
streaming replication) or to visibility (as with Group Commit).
The former eliminates the need for retransmissions after
a crash, while the latter ensures visibility is maintained across
restarts.

## Internal timing of operations

For a better understanding of how the different modes work, it's
helpful to realize PSR and BDR apply transactions
differently.

With physical streaming replication, the order of operations is:

-   Origin flushes a commit record to WAL, making the transaction
    visible locally.
-   Peer node receives changes and issues a write.
-   Peer flushes the received changes to disk.
-   Peer applies changes, making the transaction visible locally.

With PGD, the order of operations is different:

-   Origin flushes a commit record to WAL, making the transaction
    visible locally.
-   Peer node receives changes into its apply queue in memory.
-   Peer applies changes, making the transaction visible locally.
-   Peer persists the transaction by flushing to disk.

For Group Commit, CAMO, and Eager, the origin node waits for
a certain number of confirmations prior to making the transaction
visible locally. The order of operations is:

-   Origin flushes a prepare or precommit record to WAL.
-   Peer node receives changes into its apply queue in memory.
-   Peer applies changes, making the transaction visible locally.
-   Peer persists the transaction by flushing to disk.
-   Origin commits and makes the transaction visible locally.

The following table summarizes the differences.

| Variant          | Order of apply vs persist | Replication before or after commit |
|:-----------------|:-------------------------:|:----------------------------------:|
| PSR              |       persist first       |  after WAL flush of commit record  |
| PGD Async        |        apply first        |  after WAL flush of commit record  |
| PGD Lag Control  |        apply first        |  after WAL flush of commit record  |
| PGD Group Commit |        apply first        |      before COMMIT on origin       |
| PGD CAMO         |        apply first        |      before COMMIT on origin       |

## Configuration

Configuring Commit Scopes, is done through SQL function just like other administration
operations in PGD.

For example you might define basic Commit Scope which does Group Commit on majority
of nodes in the example_group BDR group:

```sql
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
  commit_scope_name := 'example_scope',
  origin_node_group := 'example_group',
  rule := 'ANY MAJORITY (example_group) GROUP COMMIT',
  wait_for_ready := true
);
```

You can then use the commit scope either by setting configuration variable (GUC)
`bdr.commit_scope` either per transaction or globally to that commit scope.

```sql
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL bdr.commit_scope = 'example_scope';
...
COMMIT;
```

You can also set the default commit scope for given BDR group.

```sql
SELECT bdr.alter_node_group_option(
  node_group_name := 'example_group',
  config_key := 'default_commit_scope',
  config_value := 'example_scope'
);
```

Note that the `default_commit_scope` is checked in the group tree the given origin
node belongs to from bottom to up. The `default_commit_scope` cannot be set to
the special value `local` which means no commit scope this way, for that use
the `bdr.commit_scope` configuration parameter.

Full details of the Commit Scope language with all the options are described
in the [Commit Scopes](commit-scopes) chapter.

### Postgres configuration parameters

The following table provides an overview of the configuration
settings that are required to be set to a non-default value (req) or
optional (opt) but affecting a specific variant.

| Setting (GUC)                        | Group Commit | Lag Control | PSR (1) | Legacy Sync |
|--------------------------------------|:------------:|:-----------:|:-------:|:-----------:|
| synchronous_standby_names            |     n/a      |     n/a     |   req   |     req     |
| synchronous_commit                   |     n/a      |     n/a     |   opt   |     opt     |
| synchronous_replication_availability |     n/a      |     n/a     |   opt   |     opt     |
| bdr.commit_scope                     |     opt      |     opt     |   n/a   |     n/a     |

## Planned shutdown and restarts

When using Group Commit with receive confirmations, take care
with planned shutdown or restart. By default, the apply queue is consumed
prior to shutting down. However, in the `immediate` shutdown mode, the queue
is discarded at shutdown, leading to the stopped node "forgetting"
transactions in the queue. A concurrent failure of the origin node can
lead to loss of data, as if both nodes failed.

To ensure the apply queue gets flushed to disk, use either
`smart` or `fast` shutdown for maintenance tasks. This approach maintains the
required synchronization level and prevents loss of data.

## Legacy synchronous replication using BDR

!!! Note
    Consider using [Group Commit](group-commit) instead.

### Usage

To enable synchronous replication using BDR, you need to add the application
name of the relevant BDR peer nodes to
`synchronous_standby_names`. The use of `FIRST x` or `ANY x` offers a
some flexibility if this doesn't conflict with the requirements of
non-BDR standby nodes.

Once you've added it, you can configure the level of synchronization per
transaction using `synchronous_commit`, which defaults to `on`. This setting means that
adding to `synchronous_standby_names` already enables synchronous
replication. Setting `synchronous_commit` to `local` or `off` turns
off synchronous replication.

Due to BDR applying the transaction before persisting it, the
values `on` and `remote_apply` are equivalent (for logical
replication).

### Migration to Commit Scopes

The Group Commit feature of BDR is configured independent of
`synchronous_commit` and `synchronous_standby_names`. Instead, the
`bdr.commit_scope` GUC allows you to select the scope per transaction. And
instead of `synchronous_standby_names` configured on each node
individually, Group Commit uses globally synchronized Commit Scopes.

!!! Note
    While the grammar for `synchronous_standby_names` and Commit
    Scopes looks similar, the former
    doesn't account for the origin node, but the latter does.
    Therefore, for example, `synchronous_standby_names = 'ANY 1 (..)'`
    is equivalent to a Commit Scope of `ANY 2 (...)`. This choice
    makes reasoning about majority easier and reflects that the origin
    node also contributes to the durability and visibility of the
    transaction.
