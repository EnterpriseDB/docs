EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) offers a range of synchronous modes to complement its
default asynchronous replication. These synchronous modes are configured through
commit scopes; rules that define how operations are handled and when the system
should consider a transaction committed. 

## Introducing 

* [Overview](overview) introduces the concepts and some of the essential 
terminology which is used when discussing synchronous commits.

* [Durability terminology](durabilityterminology) lists terms used around PGD's 
durability options, including how nodes are referred to in replication.

* [Commit scopes](commit-scopes) is a more in-depth look at the structure
of commit scopes and how to define them for your needs.

* [Commit scope rules](commit-scope-rules) looks at the syntax of and how to formulate
a commit scope rule.

* [Comparing](comparing) compares how each option behaves.

## Commit scope kinds

* [Group Commit](group-commit) focuses on the Group Commit option, where you can
define a transaction as done when a group of nodes agrees it's done.

* [CAMO](camo) focuses on the Commit At Most Once option, in which applications
take responsibility for verifying that a transaction has been committed before
retrying. This ensures that their commits only happen at most once.

* [Lag Control](lag-control) looks at the commit scope mechanism which
dynamically throttle nodes according to the slowest node and regulates how far
out of sync nodes may go when a database node goes out of service.

* [Synchronous Commit](synchronous_commit) examines a commit scope mechanism which works
in a similar fashion to legacy synchronous replication, but from within the commit scope framework.

## Working with commit scopes

* [Administering](administering) addresses how a PGD cluster with Group Commit
in use should be managed.

* [Limitations](limitations) lists the various combinations of durability options
which are not currently supported or not possible. Do refer to this before deciding
on a durability strategy.

* [Legacy Synchronous Replication](legacy-sync) shows how traditional Postgres synchronous operations
can still be accessed under PGD.

* [Internal timing of operations](timing) compares legacy replication with PGD's async and synchronous
operations, especially the difference in the order by which transactions are flushed to disk or made visible.
