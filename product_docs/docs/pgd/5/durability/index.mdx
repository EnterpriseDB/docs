EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) offers a range of synchronous modes to complement its
default asynchronous replication. These synchronous modes are configured through
commit scopes. Commit scopes are rules that define how operations are handled and when the system
considers a transaction committed. 

## Introducing 

* [Overview](overview) introduces the concepts and some of the essential 
terminology that's used when discussing synchronous commits.

* [Durability terminology](durabilityterminology) lists terms used around PGD's 
durability options, including how nodes are referred to in replication.

* [Commit scopes](commit-scopes) is a more in-depth look at the structure
of commit scopes and how to define them for your needs.

* [Commit scope rules](commit-scope-rules) looks at the syntax of and how to formulate
a commit scope rule.

* [Comparing](comparing) compares how each option behaves.

## Commit scope kinds

* [Group Commit](group-commit) focuses on the Group Commit option, where you can
define a transaction as done when a group of nodes agrees it's done.

* [CAMO](camo) focuses on the Commit At Most Once option, in which applications
take responsibility for verifying that a transaction has been committed before
retrying. This ensures that their commits only happen at most once.

* [Lag Control](lag-control) looks at the commit scope mechanism which
dynamically throttle nodes according to the slowest node and regulates how far
out of sync nodes may go when a database node goes out of service.

* [Synchronous Commit](synchronous_commit) examines a commit scope mechanism that works
in a similar fashion to legacy synchronous replication, but from within the commit scope framework.

## Working with commit scopes

* [Administering](administering) addresses how to manage a PGD cluster with Group Commit
in use.

* [Limitations](limitations) lists the various combinations of durability options
that aren't currently supported or aren't possible. Refer to this before deciding
on a durability strategy.

* [Legacy synchronous replication](legacy-sync) shows how traditional Postgres synchronous operations
can still be accessed under PGD.

* [Internal timing of operations](timing) compares legacy replication with PGD's async and synchronous
operations, especially the difference in the order by which transactions are flushed to disk or made visible.
