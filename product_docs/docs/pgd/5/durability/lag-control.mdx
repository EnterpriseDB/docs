title: Lag control
---

Data throughput of database applications on a BDR origin node can
exceed the rate at which committed data can be safely replicated to
downstream peer nodes. If this disparity persists beyond a period of
time or chronically in high availability applications, then
organizational objectives related to disaster recovery or business
continuity plans might not be satisfied.

The replication lag control (RLC) feature is designed to regulate this
imbalance using a dynamic rate-limiting device so that data flow between
BDR group nodes complies with these organizational objectives. It does so
by controlling the extent of replication lag between BDR nodes.

Some of these objectives include the following:

-  Recovery point objective (RPO) specifies the maximum tolerated
   amount of data that can be lost due to unplanned events, usually
   expressed as an amount of time. In non-replicated systems, RPO
   is used to set backup intervals to limit the risk of lost committed
   data due to failure. For replicated systems, RPO determines the
   acceptable amount of committed data that hasn't been safely applied
   to one or more peer nodes.

-  Resource constraint objective (RCO) acknowledges that there are finite
   storage constraints. This storage includes database files, WAL, and
   temporary or intermediate files needed for continued operation.
   For replicated systems, as lag increases the demands on these storage
   resources also increase.

-  Group elasticity objective (GEO) ensures that any node isn't
   originating new data at a clip that can't be acceptably saved to
   its peer nodes. When that is the case then the detection of that
   condition can be used as one metric in the decision to expand the
   number of database nodes. Similarly, when that condition abates then
   it might influence the decision to contract the number of database nodes.

Lag control manages replication lag by controlling the rate at which client
connections can commit READ WRITE transactions. Replication lag is
measured either as lag time or lag size, depending on the objectives
to meet. Transaction commit rate is regulated using a configured
BDR commit-delay time.

## Requirements

To get started using lag control:

-   Determine the maximum acceptable commit delay time `max_commit_delay` that can be tolerated for all database applications.

-   Decide on the lag measure to use. Choose either lag size `max_lag_size` or lag time `max_lag_time`.

-   Decide on the groups or subgroups involved and the minimum number of nodes in each collection required to satisfy confirmation. This will form the basis for the definition of a commit scope rule.

## Configuration

Lag control is specified within a commit scope, which allows  consistent and coordinated parameter settings across the nodes spanned by the commmit scope rule. A Lag control specification can be included in the default commit scope of a top group or part of an Origin group commit scope.

Using the sample node groups from the [Commit Scope](commit-scopes) chapter, this example shows lag control rules for two datacenters.

```sql
-- create a Lag control commit scope with individual rules
-- for each sub-group
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'example_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'left_dc',
    rule := 'ALL (left_dc) AND ANY 1 (right_dc) LAG CONTROL (max_commit_delay=500ms, max_lag_time=30s)',
    wait_for_ready := true
);
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'example_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'right_dc',
    rule := 'ANY 1 (left_dc) AND ALL (right_dc) LAG CONTROL (max_commit_delay=0.250ms, max_lag_size=100MB)',
    wait_for_ready := true
);
```

Note the parameter values admit unit specification that is compatible with GUC parameter conventions.

A Lag control commit scope rule can be added to existings commit scope rules that also include Group Commit and CAMO rule specifications.

`max_commit_delay` parameter permits and encourages a specification of milliseconds with a fractional part, including a sub-millisecond setting if appropriate.

## Overview

Lag control is a dynamic TPS rate-limiting mechanism that operates at the client
connection level. It's designed to be as unobtrusive as possible while
satisfying configured lag-control constraints. This means that if enough
BDR nodes can replicate changes fast enough to remain below configured
lag measure thresholds, then the BDR runtime commit delay stays fixed
at 0 milliseconds.

If this isn't the case, minimally
adjust the BDR runtime commit delay as high as needed, but no higher, until the number of
conforming nodes returns to the minimum threshold.

Even after the minimum node threshold is reached, lag control continues to attempt
to drive the BDR runtime commit delay back to zero. The BDR commit delay
might rise and fall around an equilibrium level most of the time, but if
data throughput or lag-apply rates improve then the commit delay
decreases over time.

The BDR commit delay is a post-commit delay. It occurs after the transaction
has committed and after all Postgres resources locked or acquired by the
transaction are released. Therefore, the delay doesn't prevent
concurrent active transactions from observing or modifying its values or
acquiring its resources. The same guarantee can't be made for external
resources managed by Postgres extensions. Regardless of extension
dependencies, the same guarantee can be made if the BDR extension is listed
before extension-based resource managers in `postgresql.conf`.

Strictly speaking, the BDR commit delay is not a per-transaction delay.
It is the mean value of commit delays over a stream of transactions for a
particular client connection. This technique allows the commit delay and
fine-grained adjustments of the value to escape the coarse granularity of
OS schedulers, clock interrupts, and variation due to system load. It also
allows the BDR runtime commit delay to settle within microseconds of the
lowest duration possible to maintain a lag measure threshold.

!!! Note
   Don't conflate the BDR commit delay with the Postgres
   commit delay. They are unrelated and perform different functions. Don't
   substitute one for the other.

## Transaction application

The BDR commit delay is applied to all READ WRITE transactions that
modify data for user applications. This implies that any transaction
that doesn't modify data, including declared READ WRITE transactions,
is exempt from the commit delay.

Asynchronous transaction commit also executes a BDR commit delay. This
might appear counterintuitive, but asynchronous commit, by virtue of its
performance, can be one of the greatest sources of replication lag.

Postgres and BDR auxillary processes don't delay at transaction commit.
Most notably, BDR writers don't execute a commit delay when applying
remote transactions on the local node. This is by design as BDR writers
contribute nothing to outgoing replication lag and can reduce incoming
replication lag the most by not having their transaction commits throttled
by a delay.

## Limitations

The maximum commit delay is a ceiling value representing a hard limit.
This means that  a commit delay never exceeds the configured value.
Conversely, the maximum lag measures both by size and time and
are soft limits that can be exceeded. When the maximum commit delay is reached,
there's no additional back pressure on the lag measures to prevent their
continued increase.

There's no way to exempt origin transactions that don't modify BDR
replication sets from the commit delay. For these transactions, it
can be useful to SET LOCAL the maximum transaction delay to 0.

## Caveats

Application TPS is one of many factors that can affect replication lag.
Other factors include the average size of transactions for which BDR commit
delay can be less effective. In particular, bulk load operations can
cause replication lag to rise, which can trigger a concomitant rise in
the BDR runtime commit delay beyond the level reasonably expected by normal
applications, although still under the maximum allowed delay.

Similarly, an application with a very high OLTP requirement and modest
data changes can be unduly restrained by the acceptable BDR commit delay
setting.

In these cases, it can be useful to use the `SET [SESSION|LOCAL]` command to
custom configure lag control settings for those applications or modify
those applications. For example, bulk load operations are sometimes split
into multiple, smaller transactions to limit transaction snapshot duration
and WAL retention size or establish a restart point if the bulk load fails.
In deference to lag control, those transaction commits can also schedule very
long BDR commit delays to allow digestion of the lag contributed by the
prior partial bulk load.

## Meeting organizational objectives

In the example objectives list earlier:

-   RPO can be met by setting an appropriate maximum lag time.
-   RCO can be met by setting an appropriate maximum lag size.
-   GEO can be met by monitoring the BDR runtime commit delay
    and the BDR runtime lag measures,

As mentioned, when the maximum BDR runtime commit delay is
pegged at the BDR configured commit-delay limit and the lag
measures consistently exceed their BDR-configured maximum
levels, this scenario can be a marker for BDR group expansion.
