## Synopsis

The `pgd completion` commands are used to manage the completion settings for the EDB Postgres Distributed CLI.

## Syntax

```plaintext
pgd completion <SHELL>
```

Where `<SHELL>` is the shell for which to generate the autocompletion script.

Possible values for shell are `bash`, `fish`, `zsh` and `powershell`.

## Options

No command specific options. See [Global Options](/pgd/latest/cli/command_ref/#global-options).

## Example

```shell
pgd completion zsh --dsn ''
```

This command would normally be evaluated as part of a shell session's startup files. It generates a completion script for the Zsh shell and writes it to the standard output. Therfore you would add to your `.zshrc` file:

```shell
eval "$(pgd completion zsh --dsn '')"
```
