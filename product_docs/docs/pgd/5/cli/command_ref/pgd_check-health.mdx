title: check-health
---

Checks the health of the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

### Synopsis

Performs various checks such as if all nodes are accessible and all
replication slots are working.

Please note that the current implementation of clock skew may return an
inaccurate skew value if the cluster is under high load while running this
command or has large number of nodes in it.

```sh
pgd check-health [flags]
```

### Examples

```text

  Example 1 (3 node cluster, bdr-a1 and bdr-c1 are up, bdr-b1 is down)

  $ pgd check-health

  Check      Status   Message
  -----      ------   -------
  ClockSkew  Critical Clockskew cannot be determined for at least 1 BDR node pair
  Connection Critical The node bdr-b1 is not accessible
  Raft       Warning  There is at least 1 node that is not accessible
  Replslots  Critical There is at least 1 BDR replication slot which is inactive
  Version    Warning  There is at least 1 node that is not accessible


  Example 2 (3 node cluster, all nodes are up but system clocks are not in sync)

  $ pgd check-health

  Check      Status  Message
  -----      ------  -------
  ClockSkew  Warning At least 1 BDR node pair has clockskew greater than 2 seconds
  Connection Ok      All BDR nodes are accessible
  Raft       Ok      Raft Consensus is working correctly
  Replslots  Ok      All BDR replication slots are working correctly
  Version    Ok      All nodes are running same BDR versions


  Example 3 (3 node cluster, all nodes are up and all checks are Ok)

  $ pgd check-health

  Check      Status Message
  -----      ------ -------
  ClockSkew  Ok     All BDR node pairs have clockskew within permissible limit
  Connection Ok     All BDR nodes are accessible
  Raft       Ok     Raft Consensus is working correctly
  Replslots  Ok     All BDR replication slots are working correctly
  Version    Ok     All nodes are running same BDR versions

```
