Shows the status of clock skew between each BDR node pair

## Synopsis

Shows the status of clock skew between each BDR node pair in the cluster.

Please note that the current implementation of clock skew may return an
inaccurate skew value if the cluster is under high load while running this
command or it has large number of nodes in it.

| Symbol | Meaning                      |
|--------|------------------------------|
| `*`    | ok                           |
| `~`    | warning (skew > 2 seconds)   |
| `!`    | critical ( skew > 5 seconds) |
| `x`    | down / unreachable           |
| `?`    | unknown                      |
| `-`    | n/a                          |


```sh
pgd cluster show clockskew [flags]
```

## Examples

### With skew issues

In this example with a 3 node cluster, bdr-a1 and bdr-c1 are up but bdr-b1 is down.

```sh
$ pgd cluster show clockskew
__OUTPUT__
Node   bdr-a1 bdr-b1 bdr-c1 Current Time
----   ------ ------ ------ ------------
bdr-a1 *      ?      *      2022-03-30 07:02:21.334472
bdr-b1 x      *      x      x
bdr-c1 *      ?      *      2022-03-30 07:02:21.186809
```

### Without skew issues

In this example with a 3 node cluster, all nodes are up.

```sh
$ pgd cluster show clockskew
__OUTPUT__
Node   bdr-a1 bdr-b1 bdr-c1 Current Time
----   ------ ------ ------ ------------
bdr-a1 *      *      *      2022-03-30 07:04:54.147017
bdr-b1 *      *      *      2022-03-30 07:04:54.340543
bdr-c1 *      *      *      2022-03-30 07:04:53.90451
```
