## Synopsis

The `pgd cluster verify` command is used to verify the configuration of an EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

## Syntax

```plaintext
pgd cluster show [OPTIONS]
```

## Options

The following table lists the options available for the `pgd events show` command:

| Short | Long       | Description                              |
|-------|------------|------------------------------------------|
|       | --settings | Verify Postgres settings in the cluster. |
|       | --arch     | Verify the cluster architecture          |
|       | --verbose  | Display verbose output.                  |

With no option set, both setting and arch are verified by default and output is not verbose.

## Examples

### Verify the cluster settings and architecture

```shell
pgd cluster verify
__OUTPUT__
# Architecture

Cluster has data nodes
----------------------
Cluster must have at least one data node

Result: Ok


Witness nodes per group
-----------------------
Each data group has at most one witness node

Result: Ok


Witness-only groups
-------------------
Cluster has at most one witness-only group

Result: Ok


Data nodes per group
--------------------
Each data group has at least one data node

Result: Ok


Empty groups
------------
There are no empty groups

Result: Ok


# Settings

max_prepared_transactions
-------------------------
The maximum number of prepared transactions that can be active in parallel.
Needed for CAMO and GROUP COMMIT features to work.

Result: Ok


bdr.raft_group_max_connections
------------------------------
The maximum number of Raft connections that can be made in a BDR cluster.
Effectively limits how many nodes can exist in the cluster.

Result: Ok


bdr.standby_slot_names
----------------------
Replication slot names that changes must be replicated to before any other
nodes can receiver changes.

Result: Ok


bdr.writers_per_subscription
----------------------------
The number of writers that can be attached to a single subscription. This
setting is used to limit the number of parallel writers that can be attached
to a single subscription.

Result: Ok


bdr.standby_slots_min_confirmed
-------------------------------
The minimum number of bdr.standby_slot_names slots that must be confirmed
before a node can receive changes.

Result: Ok


max_connections
---------------
The maximum number of client connections that can be made to the database.

Result: Ok


wal_level
---------
The level of information written to the WAL. BDR requires "logical" WAL level.

Result: Ok


bdr.start_workers
-----------------
This setting controls whether PGD workers are started. Without this PGD is not
able to work. Should be only disabled internally by PGD or PGD CLI.

Result: Ok


bdr.xact_replication
--------------------
Controls whether transactions are replicated.

Result: Ok


bdr.ddl_locking
---------------
Whether DDL locking is enabled. DDL locking serializes DDL locks across the
cluster and ensures that DML which conflicts with DDL is blocked during the
DDL execution.

Result: Ok


bdr.max_writers_per_subscription
--------------------------------
The maximum number of writers that can be attached to a single subscription.
This setting sets upper limit for bdr.writers_per_subscription.

Result: Ok


max_replication_slots
---------------------
The maximum number of replication slots that can exist at the same time. Also
maximum number of origins that can exist at the same time. Must be high enough
for PGD to work.

Result: Ok


max_worker_processes
--------------------
The maximum number of background processes that can be registered at the same
time. PGD uses several background processes to function.

Result: Ok


track_commit_timestamp
----------------------
Controls whether the commit timestamp tracking is enabled. BDR requires this
to function.

Result: Ok


bdr.role_replication
--------------------
Controls whether the role and user related commands are replicated.

Result: Ok


max_wal_senders
---------------
The maximum number of WAL senders that can ber running at the same time. Must
be high enough for PGD to work.

Result: Ok


shared_preload_libraries
------------------------
A list of shared libraries that are preloaded into each backend. BDR must be
one of them.

Result: Ok


bdr.replay_progress_frequency
-----------------------------
The frequency at which replay progress is updated. This setting controls how
often the replay progress is updated in the bdr.replication_progress table via
Raft. This table is used to determine how much WAL needs to be kept.

Result: Ok


bdr.accept_connections
----------------------
Whether the node accepts incoming replication connections from other PGD
nodes. Should only be disabled for internal use by PGD and PGD CLI.

Result: Ok
