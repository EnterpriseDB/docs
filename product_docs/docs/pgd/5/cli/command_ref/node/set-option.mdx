## Synopsis

The `pgd node set-option` command is used to set node-level options in the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

## Syntax

```plaintext
pgd node <NODE_NAME> set-option [OPTIONS] <OPTION> <VALUE>
```

Where `<NODE_NAME>` is the name of the node for which you want to get options.

And `<OPTION>` is the name of a specific node option you want to get and `<VALUE>` is the value you want it set to.  

The following options are available:

| route_writes   | Set to allow node to route writes. |
| route_reads    | Set to allow node to route reads.  |
| route_dsn      | DSN for connections to this node   |
