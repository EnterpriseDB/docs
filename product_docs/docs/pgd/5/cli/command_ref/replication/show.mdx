## Synopsis

The `pgd replication show` command is used to display the replication status in the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

By default, with no options, it produces reports on the following:

* Node Replication Progress: A matrix of the replication status between nodes.
* Replication Slots: The replication slots status for each node's slots.
* Subscriptions: The subscription status for each subscription between nodes.
* Analytics Replication: The analytics replication status for each node.

Options can be used to restrict the output to any one of the above reports. The `--verbose` option can be used to increase the detail in the default report to show the LSN and the replication lag for each node's connection to other nodes.

## Syntax
