## Synopsis

The `pgd raft show` command is used to display the Raft status in the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster. In particular, it lists all nodes in all groups, including the top level group, and their Raft status - leader or follower, number of nodes in the group with them, number of voting nodes in the group, presence of a leader, and the term number.

## Syntax

```shell
pgd raft show [OPTIONS]
```

## Options

No command specific options. See [Global Options](../index#global-options).

## Examples

### Show Raft status

```shell
pgd raft show

Note that `dc1` here is a data group with local routing, and `pgd` is the top level group with global routing. `sonode-one` and `sonode2` are subscriber-only nodes in the `sogroup1` group but that is an Optimized Topology group, and the nodes do not participate in voting for the Raft consensus.

The `Protocol Version` column shows the version of the Raft protocol in use. The `Commit Index` column shows the index of the last committed log entry. The `Nodes` column shows the total number of nodes in the group. The `Voting Nodes` column shows the number of nodes that participate in the Raft consensus. The `State` column shows the Raft state of the node - leader or follower. The `Leader Name` column shows the name of the leader node in the group. The `Current Term` column shows the current term number.
