## Node States
| State        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NONE         | Node state is unset when the worker starts, expected to be set quickly to the current known state.                                                                                                                                           |
| CREATED      | bdr.create_node() has been executed, but the node isn't a member of any EDB Postgres Distributed cluster yet.                                                                                                                                |
| JOIN_START   | bdr.join_node_group() begins to join the local node to an existing EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.                                                                                                                                         |
| JOINING      | The node join has started and is currently at the initial sync phase, creating the schema and data on the node.                                                                                                                              |
| CATCHUP      | Initial sync phase is complete; now the join is at the last step of retrieving and applying transactions that were performed on the upstream peer node since the join started.                                                               |
| STANDBY      | Node join has finished, but not yet started to broadcast changes. All joins spend some time in this state, but if defined as a Logical Standby, the node will continue in this state.                                                        |
| PROMOTE      | Node was a logical standby and we just called bdr.promote_node to move the node state to ACTIVE. These two PROMOTE states have to be coherent to the fact, that only one node can be with a state higher than STANDBY but lower than ACTIVE. |
| PROMOTING    | Promotion from logical standby to full BDR node is in progress.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ACTIVE       | The node is a full BDR node and is currently ACTIVE. This is the most common node status.                                                                                                                                                    |
| PART_START   | Node was ACTIVE or STANDBY and we just called bdr.part_node to remove the node from the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.                                                                                                                    |
| PARTING      | Node disconnects from other nodes and plays no further part in consensus or replication.                                                                                                                                                     |
| PART_CATCHUP | Non-parting nodes synchronize any missing data from the recently parted node.                                                                                                                                                                |
| PARTED       | Node parting operation is now complete on all nodes.                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Only one node at a time can be in either of the states PROMOTE or PROMOTING.
STANDBY indicates that the node is in a read-only state.
