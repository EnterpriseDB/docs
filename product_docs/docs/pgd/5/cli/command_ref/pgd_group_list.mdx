Lists all groups in the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster and their summary

## Synopsis

Lists all groups in the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster and their summary.

In some cases when raft isn't working properly or the group raft leader
isn't present, this command might show a stale or incorrect write leader for
that group.

```sh
pgd group list [flags]
```

## Examples

### Listing all the groups in a multi-group cluster

In this example, we list the nodes of a multi-group cluster
This cluster includes a special witness-only data group (group_c) and subscriber-only group (group_so).
  
Note:
  1. For group write leader election both enable_raft (Raft) and
  enable_proxy_routing (Routing) options should be true for that group
  2. enable_raft (Raft) is always set to true for global group

```sh
  $ pgd group list
__OUTPUT__
  Group    Group ID   Type            Parent Group Location Raft  Routing Raft Leader Write Leader

  group_b  402614658  data            bdrgroup     b        true  true    bdr-b1      bdr-b1

  group_so 2123208041 subscriber-only bdrgroup     c        false false
```
