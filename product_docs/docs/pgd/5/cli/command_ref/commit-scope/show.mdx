## Synopsis

The `pgd commit-scope show` command is used to display information about a commit scope in the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

## Syntax

```shell
pgd commit-scope <COMMIT_SCOPE> show [OPTIONS]
```

Where `<COMMIT_SCOPE>` is the name of the commit scope for which you want to display information.

## Options

No command specific options. See [Global Options](../index#global-options).

## Example

### Showing a Commit Scope

The following example shows the information about the commit scope `abc1`:

```shell
pgd commit-scope abc1 show
__OUTPUT__
Commit Scope Group Name Rule Definition
------------ ---------- --------------------------------------
abc1         dc1        ANY 2 (dc1) on replicated group commit
```

The `Rule Definition` column shows the rule that defines the commit scope. In this case, the rule is `ANY 2 (dc1) on replicated group commit`. This rule specifies that the commit scope `abc1` requires at least two nodes in the `dc1` group to commit a transaction before it is considered committed. The `dc1` group is a replicated group, so the commit must be replicated to at least two nodes in the group.
