## Synopsis

The `pgd commit-scope update` command is used to update a commit scope in the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

## Syntax

```shell
pgd commit-scope <COMMIT_SCOPE> update [OPTIONS] <RULE_DEFINITION>[GROUP_NAME]
```

Where `<COMMIT_SCOPE>` is the name of the commit scope to update.

The `<RULE_DEFINITION>` is the rule that defines the commit scope. The rule specifies the conditions that must be met for a transaction to be considered committed. See [Commit Scopes](/pgd/latest/commit-scopes) and [Commit Scope Rules](/pgd/latest/commit_scopes/commit-scope-rules) for more information on the rule syntax.

The optional `[GROUP_NAME]` is the name of the group to which the commit scope belongs. If omitted, it defaults to the top-level group.

## Options

No command specific options. See [Global Options](../index#global-options).

## Examples

The following example updates the commit scope `abc1` with the rule `ANY 3 (dc1) on replicated group commit`:
