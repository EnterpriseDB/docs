PGD CLI can be installed on any system which is able to connect to the PGD cluster. You will require a user with Postgres superuser privileges (or equivalent, e.g. edb_admin on Big Animal PGD) to use PGD CLI.

## PGD CLI and database connection strings

You may not need a database connection string. For example, when Trusted Postgres Architect installs the PGD CLI on a system, it also configures the connection to the PGD cluster. This means that PGD CLI will automatically connect when run. 

## Getting your database connection string


### For a TPA-deployed PGD cluster



### For a BigAnimal distributed high-availability cluster



### For an EDB PGD for Kubernetes deployed cluster
