You can install PGD CLI on any system that can connect to the PGD cluster. To use PGD CLI, you need a user with PGD superuser privileges or equivalent. The PGD user with superuser privileges is the [bdr_superuser role](../security). An example of an equivalent user is edb_admin on an EDB BigAnimal distributed high-availability cluster.

## PGD CLI and database connection strings

You might not need a database connection string. For example, when Trusted Postgres Architect installs the PGD CLI on a system, it also configures the connection to the PGD cluster. This means that PGD CLI can connect to the cluster when run. 

## Getting your database connection string

Because of the range of different configurations that PGD supports, every deployment method has a different way of deriving a connection string for it. Generally, you can obtain the required information from the configuration of your deployment. You can then assemble that information into connection strings.

### For a TPA-deployed PGD cluster

Because TPA is so flexible, you have to derive your connection string from your cluster configuration file (`config.yml`). 

- You need the name or IP address of a host with the role pgd-proxy listed for it. This host has a proxy you can connect to. Usually the proxy listens on port 6432. (Check the setting for `default_pgd_proxy_options` and `listen_port` in the config to confirm.) 
- The default database name is `bdrdb`. (Check the setting `bdr_database` in the config to confirm.) 
- The default PGD superuser is enterprisedb for EDB Postgres Advanced Server and postgres for PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Extended Server.

You can then assemble a connection string based on that information:

```
"host=<hostnameOrIPAddress> port=<portnumber> dbname=<databasename> user=<username> sslmode=require"
```

To illustrate this, here are some excerpts of a `config.yml` file for a cluster:

```yaml
...
cluster_vars:
  ...
  bdr_database: bdrdb
  ...
  default_pgd_proxy_options:
    listen_port: 6432
  ...

instances:
- Name: kaboom
  backup: kapok
  location: dc1
  node: 1
  role:
  - bdr
  - pgd-proxy
  networks:
  - ipv4_address: 192.168.100.2
    name: tpanet
...
```

The connection string for this cluster is:

```
"host=192.168.100.2 port=6432 dbname=bdrdb user=enterprisedb sslmode=require"
```

!!! Note Host name versus IP address
The example uses the IP address because the configuration is from a Docker TPA install with no name resolution available. Generally, you can use the host name as configured.

### For an EDB BigAnimal distributed high-availability cluster

1. Log in to the [BigAnimal clusters](https://portal.biganimal.com/clusters) view.
1. In the filter, set **Cluster Type** to **Distributed High Availability** to show only clusters that work with PGD CLI.
1. Select your cluster.
1. In the view of your cluster, select the **Connect** tab.
1. Copy the read/write URI from the connection info. This is your connection string.

### For a cluster deployed with EDB PGD for Kubernetes

As with TPA, EDB PGD for Kubernetes is very flexible, and there are multiple ways to obtain a connection string. It depends, in large part, on how the [services](/postgres_distributed_for_kubernetes/latest/connectivity/#services) were configured for the deployment: 

- If you use the Node Service Template, direct connectivity to each node and proxy service is available. 
- If you use the Group Service Template, there's a gateway service to each group. 
- If you use the Proxy Service Template, a single proxy provides an entry point to the cluster for all applications. 

Consult your configuration file to determine this information. 

Establish a host name or IP address, port, database name, and username. The default database name is `bdrdb`, and the default username is enterprisedb for EDB Postgres Advanced Server and postgres for PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Extended Server.

You can then assemble a connection string based on that information:

```
"host=<hostnameOrIPAddress> port=<portnumber> dbname=<databasename> user=<username>"
```

If the deployment's configuration requires it, add `sslmode=<sslmode>`.
