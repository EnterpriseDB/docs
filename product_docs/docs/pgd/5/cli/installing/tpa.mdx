By default, Trusted Postgres Architect installs and configures PGD CLI on each PGD node. 

If you want to install PGD CLI on any non-PGD instance in the cluster, attach the pgdcli role to that instance in Trusted Postgres Architect's configuration file before deploying. 

See [Trusted Postgres Architect](/tpa/latest/) for more information.
