PGD CLI can be installed on any system which is able to connect to the PGD cluster. You will require a user with PGD superuser privileges - the [bdr_superuser role](../security - or equivalent (e.g. edb_admin on BigAnimal distributed high-availability) to use PGD CLI.

## Installing automatically with Trusted Postgres Architect (TPA)
By default, Trusted Postgres Architect installs and configures PGD CLI on each PGD node. If you want to install PGD CLI on any non-PGD instance in the cluster, attach the pgdcli role to that instance in Trusted Postgres Architect's configuration file before deploying. See [Trusted Postgres Architect](/tpa/latest/) for more information.

## Installing manually on Linux

PGD CLI is installable from the EDB Repositories. These repositories require a token to enable downloads from them. You will need to login to [EDB Repos 2.0](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) to obtain your token. Then execute the following command, substituting
your token for `<your-token>`.

### Add repository and install PGD CLI on Debian or Ubuntu

```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/<your-token>/postgres_distributed/setup.deb.sh' | sudo -E bash
sudo apt-get install edb-pgd5-cli
```

### Add repository and install PGD CLI on RHEL, Rocky, AlmaLinux or Oracle Linux

```bash
curl -1sLf 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/<your-token>/postgres_distributed/setup.rpm.sh' | sudo -E bash
sudo yum install edb-pgd5-cli
```
