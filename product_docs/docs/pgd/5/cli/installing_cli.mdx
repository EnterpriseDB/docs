Trusted Platform Architect installs and configures PGD CLI on each PGD node, by default. If you wish to install PGD CLI on any non-PGD instance in the cluster, you simply attach the pgdcli role to that instance in TPA's configuration file before deploying. See [Trusted Platform Architect](/pgd/latest/tpa) for more information.

## Installing manually

You can manually install the PGD CLI on any Linux machine using `.deb` and `.rpm` packages available from the EDB repository. The package name is `edb-pgd5-cli`. For example:

```sh
# for Debian
sudo apt-get install edb-pgd5-cli
```

When the PGD CLI is configured by TPA, it connects automatically, but with a manual installation to a standalone EDB Postgres Distributed cluster you need to provide a connection string.


### Specifying database connection strings

You can use a configuration file to specify the database connection strings for your cluster. Alternatively, you can pass the connection string directly to a command. For details, see the [sample use case](/pgd/latest/cli/#passing-a-database-connection-string).

#### Using a configuration file

Use the `pgd-cli-config.yml` configuration file to specify the database connection string for your cluster. The configuration file must contain the database connection string for at least one BDR node in the cluster. The cluster name is optional and isn't validated.

For example:

```yaml
cluster:
  name: cluster-name
  endpoints:
  - "host=bdr-a1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres "
  - "host=bdr-b1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres "
  - "host=bdr-c1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres "
```

By default, `pgd-cli-config.yml` is located in the `/etc/edb/pgd-cli` directory. In v1, the file was named `pgd-config.yml` and default location was `/etc/edb`. The PGD CLI searches for `pgd-cli-config.yml` in the following locations. Precedence order is high to low.

  1. `/etc/edb/pgd-cli` (default)
  2. `$HOME/.edb/pgd-cli`

If you rename the file or move it to another location, specify the new name and location using the optional `-f` or `--config-file` flag when entering a command. See the [sample use case](/pgd/latest/cli/#passing-a-database-connection-string).
