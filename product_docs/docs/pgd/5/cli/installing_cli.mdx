navTitle: "Installing PGD CLI"

By default, Trusted Postgres Architect installs and configures PGD CLI on each PGD node. If you want to install PGD CLI on any non-PGD instance in the cluster, attach the pgdcli role to that instance in Trusted Postgres Architect's configuration file before deploying. See [Trusted Postgres Architect](/tpa/latest/) for more information.

## Installing manually

You can manually install the PGD CLI on any Linux machine using `.deb` and `.rpm` packages available from the EDB repository. The package name is `edb-pgd5-cli`. For example:

```sh
# for Debian
sudo apt-get install edb-pgd5-cli
```

When Trusted Postgres Architect configures the PGD CLI, it connects automatically. With a manual installation to a standalone EDB Postgres Distributed cluster, you need to provide a connection string.


### Specifying database connection strings

You can use a configuration file to specify the database connection strings for your cluster. Alternatively, you can pass the connection string directly to a command. For details, see the [sample use case](/pgd/latest/cli/#passing-a-database-connection-string).

#### Using a configuration file

Use the `pgd-cli-config.yml` configuration file to specify the database connection string for your cluster. The configuration file must contain the database connection string for at least one PGD node in the cluster. The cluster name is optional and isn't validated.

For example:

```yaml
cluster:
  name: cluster-name
  endpoints:
  - "host=bdr-a1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres "
  - "host=bdr-b1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres "
  - "host=bdr-c1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres "
```

By default, `pgd-cli-config.yml` is located in the `/etc/edb/pgd-cli` directory. The PGD CLI searches for `pgd-cli-config.yml` in the following locations. Precedence order is high to low.

  1. `/etc/edb/pgd-cli` (default)
  2. `$HOME/.edb/pgd-cli`

If you rename the file or move it to another location, specify the new name and location using the optional `-f` or `--config-file` flag when entering a command. See the [sample use case](/pgd/latest/cli/#passing-a-database-connection-string).

!!! Note Avoiding stale data
The PGD CLI can return stale data on the state of the cluster if it's still connecting to nodes that were previously parted from the cluster. Edit the `pgd-cli-config.yml` file, or change your `--dsn` settings to ensure only active nodes in the cluster are listed for connection.
