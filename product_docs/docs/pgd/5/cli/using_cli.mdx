## What is the PGD CLI?

The PGD CLI is a convenient way to connect to and manage your PGD cluster. To use it, you need a user with PGD superuser privileges or equivalent. The PGD user with superuser privileges is the [bdr_superuser role](../security). An example of an equivalent user is edb_admin on an EDB Cloud Service distributed high-availability cluster.

!!! Important Setting passwords
PGD CLI doesn't interactively prompt for your password. You must pass your password using one of the following methods:

 - Adding an entry to your [`.pgpass` password file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html), which includes the host, port, database name, user name, and password.
 - Setting the password in the `PGPASSWORD` environment variable.
 - Including the password in the connection string.

We recommend the first option, as the other options don't scale well with multiple databases, or they compromise password confidentiality.
!!!

## Running the PGD CLI

Once you have [installed pgd-cli](installing), run the `pgd` command to access the PGD command line interface. The `pgd` command needs details about the host, port, and database to connect to, along with your username and password.

## Passing a database connection string

Use the `--dsn` flag to pass a database connection string to the `pgd` command. When you pass the connection string with the `--dsn` flag, you don't need a configuration file. The flag takes precedence even if a configuration file is present. For example:

```sh
pgd nodes list --dsn "host=bdr-a1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=enterprisedb"
```

See [PGD CLI Command reference](/pgd/latest/cli/command_ref/) for a description of the command options.

## Specifying a configuration file

If a `pgd-cli-config.yml` file is in `/etc/edb/pgd-cli` or `$HOME/.edb/pgd-cli`, `pgd` uses it. You can override
this behavior using the optional `-f` or `--config-file` flag. For example:

```sh
pgd nodes list -f /opt/my-config.yml
__OUTPUT__
Node Name Group Name   Node Kind Join State Node Status
--------- ------------ --------- ---------- -----------
kaftan    dc1_subgroup data      ACTIVE     Up         
kaolin    dc1_subgroup data      ACTIVE     Up         
kaboom    dc1_subgroup data      ACTIVE     Up  
```


## Specifying the output format

Use the `-o` or `--output` flag to change the default output format to JSON or YAML. For example:

```sh
pgd nodes list -o json
[
  {
    "node_name": "kaftan",
    "node_group_name": "dc1_subgroup",
    "node_kind_name": "data",
    "join_state": "ACTIVE",
    "node_status": "Up",
    "node_id": 3490219809,
    "node_seq_id": 2,
    "node_local_dbname": "bdrdb"
  },
  {
    "node_name": "kaolin",
    "node_group_name": "dc1_subgroup",
    "node_kind_name": "data",
    "join_state": "ACTIVE",
    "node_status": "Up",
    "node_id": 2111777360,
    "node_seq_id": 1,
    "node_local_dbname": "bdrdb"
  },
  {
    "node_name": "kaboom",
    "node_group_name": "dc1_subgroup",
    "node_kind_name": "data",
    "join_state": "ACTIVE",
    "node_status": "Up",
    "node_id": 2710197610,
    "node_seq_id": 3,
    "node_local_dbname": "bdrdb"
  }
]
```

The PGD CLI supports the following output formats.

| Setting | Format | Considerations |
| ------- | ------ | --------- |
|  none    | Tabular | Default format. This setting presents the data in tabular form.|
| `json`   | JSON | Presents the raw data with no formatting. For some commands, the JSON output might show more data than the tabular output, such as extra fields and more detailed messages. |
| `ascii`  | ASCII | Presents the data in a ascii table for another tabular option. |
| `psql`   | PSQL | Another tabular view in PSQL format. |
| `modern` | Tabular | Another tabular view very similar to the PSQL format option, but with a more explicit table. |
| `markdown` | Markdown | Another tabular option in Markdown style. |

## Accessing the command line help

To list the supported commands, enter:

```sh
pgd --help
```

For help with a specific command and its parameters, enter `pgd <command_name> --help`. For example:

```sh
pgd nodes list --help
```

!!! Note Avoiding stale data
The PGD CLI can return stale data on the state of the cluster if it's still connecting to nodes previously parted from the cluster. Edit the `pgd-cli-config.yml` file, or change your `--dsn` settings to ensure you are connecting to active nodes in the cluster.
