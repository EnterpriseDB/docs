The EDB Postgres Distributed Command Line Interface (PGD CLI) is a tool for managing your EDB Postgres Distributed cluster. It allows you to run commands against EDB Postgres Distributed clusters. It may be installed automatically on systems within a TPA-deployed PGD cluster or it can be installed manually on systems that can connect to any PGD cluster, including BigAnimal Distributed High Availability PGD clusters or PGD clusters deployed using the EDB PGD for Kubernetes operator.

See [Installing PGD CLI](installing_cli) for information about how to install PGD CLI, both automatically with Trusted Postgres Architect and manually.

See [Using PGD CLI](using_cli) for an introduction to using the PGD CLI and connecting to your PGD cluster.

See [Configuring PGD CLI](configuring_cli) for details on creating persistent configurations for quicker connections.

See the [Command reference](command_ref) for the available commands to inspect, manage, and get information about cluster resources.

There is also a guide to [discovering connection strings](discover_connections). It shows how to obtain the correct connection strings for your PGD-powered deployment.
