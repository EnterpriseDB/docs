The EDB Postgres Distributed Command Line Interface (PGD CLI) is a tool for managing your EDB Postgres Distributed cluster. It allows you to run commands against EDB Postgres Distributed clusters.

See the [Command reference](command_ref) for the available commands to inspect, manage, and get information about cluster resources.

See [Installing PGD CLI](installing_cli) for information about how Trusted Postgres Architect deploys PGD CLI, how to install PGD CLI on a standalone server manually, and specifying connection strings.

## Requirements

The PGD CLI requires Postgres superuser privileges to run.

## Using the PGD CLI
`pgd` is the command name for the PGD command line interface. See [pgd](command_ref) in the command reference for a description of the command options.

## Specifying a configuration file

If you rename the file or move it to another location, specify the new name and location using the optional `-f` or `--config-file` flag. For example:

```sh
  pgd show-nodes -f /opt/my-config.yml
```

## Passing a database connection string

Use the `--dsn` flag to pass a database connection string directly to a command. You don't need a configuration file if you pass the connection string with this flag. The flag takes precedence if a configuration file is present. For example:

```sh
pgd show-nodes --dsn "host=bdr-a1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres "
```

## Specifying the output format

The PGD CLI supports the following output formats:

| Format  | Considerations |
| ------- | -------------- |
| tabular | Default format. Presents the data in tabular form.|
| json    | Presents the raw data with no formatting. For some commands, the json output might show more data than in the tabular output, such as extra fields and more detailed messages. |
| yaml    | Same as json except field order is alphabetical. Experimental and might not be fully supported in future versions. |

Use the `-o` or `--output` flag to change the default output format to json or yaml. For example:

```sh
pgd show-nodes -o json
```

## Accessing the command line help

To list the supported commands, enter:

```sh
pgd help
```

For help for a specific command and its parameters, enter `pgd help <command_name>`. For example:

```sh
pgd help show-nodes
```
