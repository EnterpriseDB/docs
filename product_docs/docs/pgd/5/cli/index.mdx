The EDB Postgres Distributed Command Line Interface (PGD CLI) is a tool for managing your EDB Postgres Distributed cluster. It's the key tool for inspecting and managing cluster resources.

It allows you to run commands against EDB Postgres Distributed clusters to:
 * Determine the health of the cluster, inspect the cluster's configuration, and manage the cluster's resources. 
 * Inspect and manage the cluster's nodes, groups, and proxies.
 * Perform switchover operations on the write leaders of groups.

PGD CLI is installed automatically on systems in a TPA-deployed PGD cluster. 

You can also install it manually on Linux and macOS systems that can connect to a PGD cluster, including:
  * Distributed high-availability clusters managed by EDB Postgres® AI Cloud Services (formerly BigAnimal).
  * PGD clusters deployed using the EDB PGD for Kubernetes operator.
  * Manually deployed PGD clusters.
  * TPA-deployed PGD clusters.


<!-- * [Installing PGD CLI](installing_cli) has instructions on manually installing PGD CLI on various systems.

* [Using PGD CLI](using_cli) offers an introduction to using the PGD CLI and how to connect to your PGD cluster.

* [Configuring PGD CLI](configuring_cli) has details on creating persistent configurations for quicker connections.

* [PGD CLI's Command reference](command_ref) covers all the available commands to inspect, manage, and get information about cluster resources.

* [Discovering connection strings](discover_connections) shows how to obtain the correct connection strings for your PGD-powered deployment.
