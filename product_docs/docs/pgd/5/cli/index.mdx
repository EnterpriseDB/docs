The EDB Postgres Distributed Command Line Interface (PGD CLI) is a tool for managing your EDB Postgres Distributed cluster. It's the key tool for inspecting and managing cluster resources.

It allows you to run commands against EDB Postgres Distributed clusters to:

* Determine the health of the cluster, inspect the cluster's configuration, and manage the cluster's resources. 
* Inspect and manage the cluster's nodes and groups.
* Perform a write-leader change operation on the group.

PGD CLI is installed automatically on systems in a TPA-deployed PGD cluster. 

You can also install it manually on Linux and macOS systems that can connect to a PGD cluster, including:

* EDB Cloud Service distributed high-availability clusters.
* PGD clusters deployed using the EDB PGD for Kubernetes operator.
* Manually deployed PGD clusters.
* TPA-deployed PGD clusters.
