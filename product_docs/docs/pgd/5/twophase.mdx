navTitle: Two-phase commit
title: Explicit two-phase commit (2PC)


---

An application can explicitly opt to use two-phase commit with BDR. See
[Distributed Transaction Processing: The XA Specification](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009680699/toc.pdf).

The X/Open Distributed Transaction Processing (DTP) model envisions three
software components:

-   An application program (AP) that defines transaction boundaries and specifies
    actions that constitute a transaction
-   Resource managers (RMs, such as databases or file-access systems) that provide
    access to shared resources
-   A separate component called a transaction manager (TM) that assigns identifiers
    to transactions, monitors their progress, and takes responsibility for
    transaction completion and for failure recovery

BDR supports explicit external 2PC using the `PREPARE TRANSACTION` and
`COMMIT PREPARED`/`ROLLBACK PREPARED` commands. Externally, a EDB Postgres Distributed cluster
appears to be a single resource manager to the transaction manager for a
single session.

When `bdr.commit_scope` is `local`, the transaction is prepared only
on the local node. Once committed, changes are replicated, and
BDR then applies post-commit conflict resolution.

Using `bdr.commit_scope` set to `local` might not seem to make sense with
explicit two-phase commit, but the option is offered to allow you
to control the tradeoff between transaction latency and robustness.

Explicit two-phase commit doesn't work with either CAMO
or the global commit scope. Future releases might enable this combination.

## Use

Two-phase commits with a local commit scope work exactly like standard
PostgreSQL. Use the local commit scope and disable CAMO.

```sql
BEGIN;

SET LOCAL bdr.enable_camo = 'off';
SET LOCAL bdr.commit_scope = 'local';

... other commands possible...
```

To start the first phase of the commit, the client must assign a
global transaction id, which can be any unique string identifying the
transaction:

```sql
PREPARE TRANSACTION 'some-global-id';
```

After a successful first phase, all nodes have applied the changes and
are prepared for committing the transaction. The client must then invoke
the second phase from the same node:

```sql
COMMIT PREPARED 'some-global-id';
```
