  Introducing PGD Quick Start, how to select your Quick Start deployment and what to expect from the experience.

## Quick Start

Postgres Distributed (PGD) is very configurable. To enable you to quickly evaluate and deploy PGD, we have created this Quick Start so that you can get up and running with a fully configured PGD cluster using the same tools that you will use to deploy to production. 

* A short introduction to TPA and how it helps you configure, deploy and manage Postgres Distributed
* A guide to selecting Docker or AWS Quick Starts
  * The Docker quick start 
  * The AWS quick start
* Further exploration with your cluster


## Introducing TPA and PGD

We created TPA (Trusted Postgres Architect) to make the installation and management of various Postgres configurations easily repeatable. TPA orchestrates the creation and deployment of Postgres. In the quick starts, we install TPA first. If you already have TPA installed, you can skip those steps. TPA can be used, and re-used, to deploy various configurations of Postgres clusters.

PGD (Postgres Distributed) is a multi-master replicating implementation of Postgres designed for high performance and availability. The installation of PGD is orchestrated by TPA. 

In these Quick Starts will get TPA to generate a configuration file for a PGD demonstration cluster. This cluster will have three replicating database nodes, two connection proxies and one backup node. 

We will then use TPA to provision and deploy the required configuration and software to each node.

## Selecting Docker or AWS Quick Starts

There are two Quick Starts currently available, one uses Docker to host the PGD cluster while the other deploys PGD to AWS. 

### Docker Quick Start

The Docker Quick Start is ideal for those looking to initially explore PGD and its capabilities. The configuration of PGD is not suitable for production use, but can be valuable for testing the functionality and behavior of PGD clusters. Note that without additional step You may also find it useful when familiarizing yourself with PGD commands and APIs in preparation for deployment on cloud, VM, or bare-metal platforms.

### AWS Quick Start

The AWS Quick Start is more extensive and deploys the PGD cluster onto EC2 nodes on Amazon's cloud. The cluster's overall configuration is similar to the Docker Quick Start but instead of using Docker containers, it uses t3.micro instances of Amazon EC2 to provide the compute power. The AWS deployment is more persistent and not subject to the limitations of the Docker Quick Start deployment, but it does require more initial setup to configure the AWS CLI.
