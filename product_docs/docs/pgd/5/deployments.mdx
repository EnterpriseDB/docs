You can deploy and install EDB Postgres Distributed products using the following methods:

- [Trusted Postgres Architect](/tpa/latest) (TPA) is an orchestration tool that uses Ansible to build Postgres clusters using a set of reference architectures that document how to set up and operate Postgres in various scenarios. TPA represents the best practices followed by EDB, and its recommendations apply to quick testbed setups just as they do to production environments. See [Deploying with TPA](tpa) for more information.

- BigAnimal is a fully managed database-as-a-service with built-in Oracle compatibility that runs in your cloud account where it's operated by the Postgres experts. BigAnimal makes it easy to set up, manage, and scale your databases. The addition of extreme-high-availability support through EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) allows single-region Always On Gold clusters. These clusters are two PGD groups in different availability zones in a single cloud region, with a witness node in a third availability zone. See [Extreme high availability](/biganimal/latest/overview/02_high_availability/#extreme-high-availability-beta) in the [BigAnimal documentation](/biganimal/latest) for more information.

Coming soon:

- EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes will be a Kubernetes operator designed, developed, and supported by EDB. It will cover the full lifecycle of highly available Postgres database clusters with a multi-master architecture, using PGD replication. It's based on the open source CloudNativePG operator and provides additional value, such as compatibility with Oracle using EDB Postgres Advanced Server and additional supported platforms including IBM Power and OpenShift.
