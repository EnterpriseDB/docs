You can deploy and install EDB Postgres Distributed products using the following methods:

- [Trusted Postgres Architect](/tpa/latest) (TPA) is an orchestration tool that uses Ansible to build Postgres clusters using a set of reference architectures that document how to set up and operate Postgres in various scenarios. TPA represents the best practices followed by EDB, and its recommendations apply to quick testbed setups just as they do to production environments. See [Deploying with TPA](tpa) for more information.

- BigAnimal is a fully managed database-as-a-service with built-in Oracle compatibility that runs in your cloud account or BigAnimal's cloud account where it's operated by our Postgres experts. EDB BigAnimal makes it easy to set up, manage, and scale your databases. The addition of distributed high-availability support powered by EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) enables single- and and multi-region Always On Gold clusters. See [Distributed high availability](/biganimal/latest/overview/02_high_availability/#distributed-high-availability) in the [BigAnimal documentation](/biganimal/latest) for more information.

- EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes is a Kubernetes operator designed, developed, and supported by EDB. It covers the full lifecycle of highly available Postgres database clusters with a multi-master architecture, using PGD replication. It's based on the open source CloudNativePG operator and provides additional value, such as compatibility with Oracle using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) using EDB Postgres Extended or Advanced Server, and additional supported platforms including IBM Power and OpenShift.  This offering is currently in preview.
