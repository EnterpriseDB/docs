title: 'Known issues'
---

This section discusses currently known issues in EDB Postgres Distributed 5. 
These known issues are tracked in PGD's
ticketing system and are expected to be resolved in a future
release.

-   If the resolver for the `update_origin_change` conflict
    is set to `skip`, `synchronous_commit=remote_apply` is used, and
    concurrent updates of the same row are repeatedly applied on two
    different nodes, then one of the update statements might hang due
    to a deadlock with the PGD writer.  As mentioned in the
    [Conflicts](consistency/conflicts/) chapter, `skip` is not the default
    resolver for the `update_origin_change` conflict, and this
    combination isn't intended to be used in production. It discards
    one of the two conflicting updates based on the order of arrival
    on that node, which is likely to cause a divergent cluster.
    In the rare situation that you do choose to use the `skip`
    conflict resolver,  note the issue with the use of the
    `remote_apply` mode.

-   The Decoding Worker feature doesn't work with CAMO/EAGER/Group Commit. Installations using CAMO/Eager/Group Commit must keep `enable_wal_decoder` disabled.

-   Lag control doesn't adjust commit delay in any way on a fully
    isolated node, that is, in case all other nodes are unreachable or not
    operational. As soon as at least one node is connected, replication
    lag control picks up its work and adjusts the PGD commit delay
    again.

-   For time-based lag control, PGD currently uses the lag time (measured
    by commit timestamps) rather than the estimated catchup time that's
    based on historic apply rate.

-   Changing the CAMO partners in a CAMO pair isn't currently possible.
    It's possible only to add or remove a pair.
    Adding or removing a pair doesn't need a restart of Postgres or even a
    reload of the configuration.

-   Group Commit cannot be combined with [CAMO](durability/camo/) or [Eager All Node
    replication](consistency/eager/). Eager Replication currently only works by using the
    "global" PGD commit scope.

-   Transactions using Eager Replication can't yet execute DDL,
    nor do they support explicit two-phase commit.
    The TRUNCATE command is allowed.

-   Not all DDL can be run when either CAMO or Group Commit is used.

-   Parallel apply is not currently supported in combination with Group Commit, please make sure to disable it when using Group Commit by either setting `num_writers` to 1 for the node group (using [`bdr.alter_node_group_config`](nodes#bdralter_node_group_config)) or via the GUC `bdr.writers_per_subscription` (see [Configuration of Generic Replication](configuration#generic-replication)).

-   There currently is no protection against altering or removing a commit scope. Running transactions in a commit scope that is concurrently being altered or removed can lead to the transaction blocking or replication stalling completely due to an error on the downstream node attempting to apply the transaction. Ensure that any transactions using a specific commit scope have finished before altering or removing it.

-   The [PGD CLI](cli) can return stale data on the state of the cluster if it is still connecting to nodes that have previously been parted from the cluster. Edit the [`pgd-cli-config.yml`](cli/installing_cli/#specifying-database-connection-strings) file or change your [`--dsn`](cli/#passing-a-database-connection-string) settings to ensure only active nodes in the cluster are listed for connection.

Details of other design or implementation [limitations](limitations) are also available.
