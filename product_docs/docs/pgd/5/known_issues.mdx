These are currently known issues in EDB Postgres Distributed 5. 
These known issues are tracked in PGD's
ticketing system and are expected to be resolved in a future
release.

-   If the resolver for the `update_origin_change` conflict
    is set to `skip`, `synchronous_commit=remote_apply` is used, and
    concurrent updates of the same row are repeatedly applied on two
    different nodes, then one of the update statements might hang due
    to a deadlock with the PGD writer. As mentioned in
    [Conflicts](consistency/conflicts/), `skip` isn't the default
    resolver for the `update_origin_change` conflict, and this
    combination isn't intended to be used in production. It discards
    one of the two conflicting updates based on the order of arrival
    on that node, which is likely to cause a divergent cluster.
    In the rare situation that you do choose to use the `skip`
    conflict resolver, note the issue with the use of the
    `remote_apply` mode.

-   The Decoding Worker feature doesn't work with CAMO/Eager/Group Commit.
    Installations using CAMO/Eager/Group Commit must keep `enable_wal_decoder`
    disabled.

-   Lag Control doesn't adjust commit delay in any way on a fully
    isolated node, that is, in case all other nodes are unreachable or not
    operational. As soon as at least one node is connected, replication
    Lag Control picks up its work and adjusts the PGD commit delay
    again.

-   For time-based Lag Control, PGD currently uses the lag time (measured
    by commit timestamps) rather than the estimated catchup time that's
    based on historic apply rates.

-   Changing the CAMO partners in a CAMO pair isn't currently possible.
    It's possible only to add or remove a pair.
    Adding or removing a pair doesn't require a restart of Postgres or even a
    reload of the configuration.

-   Group Commit can't be combined with [CAMO](durability/camo/). 

-   Transactions using Eager Replication can't yet execute DDL. The TRUNCATE
    command is allowed.

-   Parallel Apply isn't currently supported in combination with Group Commit. Make sure to disable it when using Group Commit by either:
    - Setting `num_writers` to 1 for the node group using [`bdr.alter_node_group_config`](/pgd/5/reference/nodes-management-interfaces/#bdralter_node_group_config).
    - Using the GUC `bdr.writers_per_subscription`. See [Configuration of generic replication](/pgd/5/reference/pgd-settings/#generic-replication).

-   There currently is no protection against altering or removing a commit
    scope. Running transactions in a commit scope that's concurrently being
    altered or removed can lead to the transaction blocking or replication
    stalling completely due to an error on the downstream node attempting to
    apply the transaction. Make sure that any transactions using a specific commit
    scope have finished before altering or removing it.

-   The [PGD CLI](cli) can return stale data on the state of the cluster if it's
    still connecting to nodes that were previously parted from the cluster. Edit
    the [`pgd-cli-config.yml`](cli/configuring_cli/#using-a-configuration-file)
    file, or change your
    [`--dsn`](cli/configuring_cli/#using-database-connection-strings-in-the-command-line)
    settings to ensure only active nodes in the cluster are listed for
    connection.

-   When using
    [`bdr.add_commit_scope`](/pgd/5/reference/functions#bdradd_commit_scope),
    if a new commit scope is added that has the same name as a commit scope on
    any group, then the commit scope silently overwrites the commit scope but
    retains the original group the scope was associated with (if any). To modify
    a commit scope safely, use
    [`bdr.alter_commit_scope`](/pgd/5/reference/functions#bdralter_commit_scope).

Details of other design or implementation [limitations](planning/limitations) are also available.
