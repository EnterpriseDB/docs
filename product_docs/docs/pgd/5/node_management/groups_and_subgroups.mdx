title: Groups and subgroups

## Groups

A PGD cluster's nodes are gathered in groups. A "top level" group always exists and is the group
to which all data nodes belong to automatically. The "top level" group can also be
the direct parent of sub-groups. 

## Sub-groups

A group can also contain zero or more subgroups. Subgroups can be used to
represent data centers or locations allowing commit scopes to refer to nodes
in a particular region as a whole. PGD Proxy can also make use of subgroups 
to delineate nodes available to be write leader.

The `node_group_type` value specifies the type when the subgroup is created.
Some sub-group types change the behavior of the nodes within the group. For
example, a [subscriber-only](subscriber_only) sub-group will make all the nodes
within the group into subscriber-only nodes.
