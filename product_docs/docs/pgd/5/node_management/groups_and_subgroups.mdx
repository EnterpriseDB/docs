title: Groups and subgroups

## Groups

A PGD cluster's nodes are gathered in groups. A "top level" group always exists and is the group
to which all data nodes belong to automatically. The "top level" group can also be
the direct parent of sub-groups. 

## Sub-groups

A group can also contain zero or more subgroups. Each subgroup can be allocated
to a specific purpose in the top-level parent group. The `node_group_type` value
specifies the type when the subgroup is created.

Some sub-group types change the behavior of the nodes within the group. For
example, a subscriber-only sub-group will make all the nodes within the group
into subscriber-only nodes.

## Subscriber-only nodes

As the name suggests, a subscriber-only node subscribes only to replication
changes from other nodes in the cluster. However, no other nodes receive
replication changes from `subscriber-only` nodes. This is somewhat similar to
logical standby nodes. But in contrast to logical standby, the `subscriber-only`
nodes are fully joined to the cluster. They can receive replication changes from
all other nodes in the cluster and hence aren't affected by unavailability or
parting of any one node in the cluster.

A `subscriber-only` node is a fully joined PGD node and hence it receives all
replicated DDLs and acts on those. It also uses Raft to consistently report its
status to all nodes in the cluster. The `subscriber-only` node doesn't have Raft
voting rights and hence can't become a Raft leader or participate in the leader
election. Also, while it receives replicated DDLs, it doesn't participate in DDL
or DML lock acquisition. In other words, a currently down `subscriber-only` node
doesn't stop a DML lock from being acquired.

The `subscriber-only` node forms the building block for PGD Tree topology. In
this topology, a small number of fully active nodes are replicating changes in
all directions. A large number of `subscriber-only` nodes receive only changes
but never send any changes to any other node in the cluster. This topology
avoids connection explosion due to a large number of nodes, yet provides an
extremely large number of `leaf` nodes that you can use to consume the data.

## Subscriber-only groups

To make use of `subscriber-only` nodes, first create a PGD group of type
`subscriber-only`. Make it a subgroup of the group from which the member nodes
receive the replication changes. Once you create the subgroup, all nodes that
intend to become `subscriber-only` nodes must join the subgroup. You can create
more than one subgroup of `subscriber-only` type, and they can have different
parent groups.

Once a node successfully joins the `subscriber-only` subgroup, it becomes a
`subscriber-only` node and starts receiving replication changes for the parent
group. Any changes made directly on the `subscriber-only` node aren't
replicated.

See
[`bdr.create_node_group`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrcreate_node_group)
to know how to create a subgroup of a specific type and belonging to a specific
parent group.

!!! Note

Since a `subscriber-only` node doesn't replicate changes to any node in the
cluster, it can't act as a source for syncing replication changes when a node is
parted from the cluster. But if the `subscriber-only` node already received and
applied replication changes from the parted node that no other node in the
cluster currently has, then that causes inconsistency between the nodes.

For now, you can solve this by setting
[`bdr.standby_slot_names`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrstandby_slot_names)
and
[`bdr.standby_slots_min_confirmed`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrstandby_slots_min_confirmed)
so that there's always a fully active PGD node that's ahead of the
`subscriber-only` nodes. !!!
