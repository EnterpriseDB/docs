All data nodes in a PGD cluster are members of one or more groups. By default, 
all data nodes are members of the top-level group, which spans all data nodes
in the PGD cluster. Nodes can also belong to subgroups that can be configured to
reflect logical or geographical organization of the PGD cluster.

You can manage nodes and groups using the various options available
with nodes and subgroups.

* [Creating and joining groups](creating_and_joining) looks new PGD groups can be created and how to joion PGD nodes to them.

* [Witness nodes](witness_nodes) looks at a special class of PGD node, dedicated to establishing consensus in a group.

* [Logical standby nodes](logical_standby_nodes) shows how to efficiently keep a node on standby synchronized and ready to step in as a primary in the case of failure.

* [Physical standby nodes](physical_standby_nodes) covers an alternative technique of providing a standby node.

* [Groups and subgroups](groups_and_subgroups) goes into more detail on how groups and subgroups work in PGD and looks at specialized types of groups such as Subscriber-only groups.

* [Viewing topology](viewing_topology) details commands and SQL queries that can show the structure of a PGD clusters nodes and groups.

* [Removing nodes and groups](removing_nodes_and_groups) shows the process to follow to safely remove a node from a group or a group from a cluster.

* [Heterogeneous clusters](heterogeneous_clusters) looks at how your PGD cluster can interoperate with PGD nodes from earlier editions of PGD.

* [Connection DSNs](connections_dsns_and_ssl) introduces the DSNs or connection strings needed to connect directly to a node in a PGD cluster. It also covers how to use SSL/TLS certificates to provide authentication and encryption between servers and between clients. 

* [Decoding worker](decoding_worker) covers a feature of PGD that allows groups of nodes to reduce CPU overhead due to replication.

* [Replication slots](replication_slots) examines how the Postgres replication slots are consumed when PGD is operating.

 * [Node recovery](node_recovery) details the steps needed to bring a node back into service after a failure or scheduled downtime and the impact it has on the cluster as it returns.
