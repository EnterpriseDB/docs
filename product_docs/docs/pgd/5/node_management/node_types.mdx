## Data nodes

A data node in PGD is a node that runs a Postgres instance. It replicates data to all other data nodes. It also participates in the cluster-wide Raft decision-making around locking and leadership. It will be the member of one or more groups and by default will be a member of the "top level" group that spans all data nodes in the cluster.

## Witness nodes

A witness node behaves like a data node in that it participates in the cluster-wide Raft decision-making around locking and leadership. It doesn't replicate or store data, though. The purpose of a witness node is to be available to ensure a majority can be achieved when the cluster seeks a consensus. [Witness nodes](witness_nodes) has more details.

## Logical standby nodes

Logical standby nodes are nodes that receive the logical data changes from another node and replicate them locally. You can use a logical standby node to replace the node it's replicating if that node becomes unavailable, with some caveats. See [Logical standby nodes](logical_standby_nodes) for more details.

## Subscriber-only nodes

A subscriber-only node is a data node that, as the name suggests, only subscribes to changes in the cluster but doesn't replicate changes to other nodes. Subscriber-only nodes can be used as read-only nodes for applications. You create subscriber-only nodes by taking a data node and adding it to a subscriber-only group. See [Subscriber-only nodes and groups](subscriber_only) for more details.
