title: Joining a heterogeneous cluster
---


A PGD 4.0 node can join an EDB Postgres Distributed cluster running 3.7.x at a specific
minimum maintenance release (such as 3.7.6) or a mix of 3.7 and 4.0 nodes.
This procedure is useful when you want to upgrade not just the PGD
major version but also the underlying PostgreSQL major
version. You can achieve this by joining a 3.7 node running on
PostgreSQL 12 or 13 to an EDB Postgres Distributed cluster running 3.6.x on
PostgreSQL 11. The new node can also
run on the same PostgreSQL major release as all of the nodes in the
existing cluster.

PGD ensures that the replication works correctly in all directions
even when some nodes are running 3.6 on one PostgreSQL major release and
other nodes are running 3.7 on another PostgreSQL major release. However,
we recommend that you quickly bring the cluster into a
homogenous state by parting the older nodes once enough new nodes
join the cluster. Don't run any DDLs that might
not be available on the older versions and vice versa.

A node joining with a different major PostgreSQL release can't use
physical backup taken with [`bdr_init_physical`](/pgd/5/reference/nodes#bdr_init_physical), and the node must join
using the logical join method. Using this method is necessary because the major
PostgreSQL releases aren't on-disk compatible with each other.

When a 3.7 node joins the cluster using a 3.6 node as a
source, certain configurations, such as conflict resolution,
aren't copied from the source node. The node must be configured
after it joins the cluster.
