## Creating and joining PGD groups

For PGD, every node must connect to every other node. To make
configuration easy, when a new node joins, it configures all
existing nodes to connect to it. For this reason, every node, including
the first PGD node created, must know the [PostgreSQL connection string](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING) that other nodes
can use to connect to it. This connection string is
sometimes referred to as a data source name (DSN). 

Both formats of connection string are supported.
So you can use either key-value format, like `host=myhost port=5432 dbname=mydb`,
or URI format, like `postgresql://myhost:5432/mydb`.

The SQL function [`bdr.create_node_group()`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrcreate_node_group) creates the PGD group
from the local node. Doing so activates PGD on that node and allows other
nodes to join the PGD group, which consists of only one node at that point.
At the time of creation, you must specify the connection string for other
nodes to use to connect to this node.

Once the node group is created, every further node can join the PGD
group using the [`bdr.join_node_group()`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrjoin_node_group) function.

Alternatively, use the command line utility [bdr_init_physical](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes/#bdr_init_physical) to
create a new node, using `pg_basebackup` or a physical standby of an existing
node. If using `pg_basebackup`, the bdr_init_physical utility can optionally
specify the base backup of only the target database. The earlier
behavior was to back up the entire database cluster. With this utility, the activity
completes faster and also uses less space because it excludes
unwanted databases. If you specify only the target database, then the excluded
databases get cleaned up and removed on the new node.

When a new PGD node is joined to an existing PGD group or a node subscribes
to an upstream peer, before replication can begin the system must copy the
existing data from the peer nodes to the local node. This copy must be
carefully coordinated so that the local and remote data starts out
identical. It's not enough to use pg_dump yourself. The BDR
extension provides built-in facilities for making this initial copy.

During the join process, the BDR extension synchronizes existing data
using the provided source node as the basis and creates all metadata
information needed for establishing itself in the mesh topology in the PGD
group. If the connection between the source and the new node disconnects during
this initial copy, restart the join process from the
beginning.

The node that's joining the cluster must not contain any schema or data
that already exists on databases in the PGD group. We recommend that the
newly joining database be empty except for the BDR extension. However,
it's important that all required database users and roles are created.

Optionally, you can skip the schema synchronization using the `synchronize_structure`
parameter of the [`bdr.join_node_group`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrjoin_node_group) function. In this case, the schema must
already exist on the newly joining node.

We recommend that you select the source node that has the best connection (the
closest) as the source node for joining. Doing so lowers the time
needed for the join to finish.

Coordinate the join procedure using the Raft consensus algorithm, which
requires most existing nodes to be online and reachable.

The logical join procedure (which uses the [`bdr.join_node_group`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrjoin_node_group) function)
performs data sync doing `COPY` operations and uses multiple writers
(parallel apply) if those are enabled.

Node join can execute concurrently with other node joins for the majority of
the time taken to join. However, only one regular node at a time can be in
either of the states PROMOTE or PROMOTING. These states are typically fairly short if
all other nodes are up and running. Otherwise the join is serialized at
this stage. The subscriber-only nodes are an exception to this rule, and they
can be concurrently in PROMOTE and PROMOTING states as well, so their join
process is fully concurrent.

The join process uses only one node as the source, so it can be
executed when nodes are down if a majority of nodes are available.
This approach can cause a complexity when running logical join.
During logical join, the commit timestamp of rows copied from the source
node is set to the latest commit timestamp on the source node.
Committed changes on nodes that have a commit timestamp earlier than this
(because nodes are down or have significant lag) can conflict with changes
from other nodes. In this case, the newly joined node can be resolved
differently to other nodes, causing a divergence. As a result, we recommend
not running a node join when significant replication lag exists between nodes.
If this is necessary, run LiveCompare on the newly joined node to
correct any data divergence once all nodes are available and caught up.

`pg_dump` can fail when there's concurrent DDL activity on the source node
because of cache-lookup failures. Since [`bdr.join_node_group`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrjoin_node_group) uses pg_dump
internally, it might fail if there's concurrent DDL activity on the source node.
Retrying the join works in that case.
