## Removing a node from a PGD group

Since PGD is designed to recover from extended node outages, you
must explicitly tell the system if you're removing a node
permanently. If you permanently shut down a node and don't tell
the other nodes, then performance suffers and eventually
the whole system stops working.

Node removal, also called *parting*, is done using the [`bdr.part_node()`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrpart_node)
function. You must specify the node name (as passed during node creation)
to remove a node. You can call the [`bdr.part_node()`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrpart_node) function from any active
node in the PGD group, including the node that you're removing.

Just like the join procedure, parting is done using Raft consensus and requires a
majority of nodes to be online to work.

The parting process affects all nodes. The Raft leader manages a vote
between nodes to see which node has the most recent data from the parting node.
Then all remaining nodes make a secondary, temporary connection to the
most-recent node to allow them to catch up any missing data.

A parted node still is known to PGD but doesn't consume resources. A
node might be added again under the same name as a parted node.
In rare cases, you might want to clear all metadata of a parted
node by using the function [`bdr.drop_node()`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrdrop_node).

## Removing a whole PGD group

PGD groups usually map to locations. When a location is no longer being deployed,
it's likely that the PGD group for the location also needs to be removed.

The PGD group that's being removed must be empty. Before you can remove the 
group, you must part all the nodes in the group.
