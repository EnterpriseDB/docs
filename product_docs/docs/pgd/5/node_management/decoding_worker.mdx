title: Decoding worker
---

PGD provides an option to enable a decoding worker process that performs
decoding once, no matter how many nodes are sent data. This introduces a
new process, the WAL decoder, on each PGD node. One WAL sender process still
exists for each connection, but these processes now just perform the task of
sending and receiving data. Taken together, these changes reduce the CPU
overhead of larger PGD groups and also allow higher replication throughput
since the WAL sender process now spends more time on communication.

`enable_wal_decoder` is an option for each PGD group, which is currently
disabled by default. You can use [`bdr.alter_node_group_config()`](reference/nodes-management-interfaces/#bdralter_node_group_config) to enable or
disable the decoding worker for a PGD group.

When the decoding worker is enabled, PGD stores logical change record (LCR)
files to allow buffering of changes between decoding and when all
subscribing nodes received data. LCR files are stored under the
`pg_logical` directory in each local node's data directory. The number and
size of the LCR files varies as replication lag increases, so this also
needs monitoring. The LCRs that aren't required by any of the PGD nodes are cleaned
periodically. The interval between two consecutive cleanups is controlled by
[`bdr.lcr_cleanup_interval`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrlcr_cleanup_interval), which defaults to 3 minutes. The cleanup is
disabled when [`bdr.lcr_cleanup_interval`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrlcr_cleanup_interval) is zero.

When disabled, logical decoding is performed by the WAL sender process for each
node subscribing to each node. In this case, no LCR files are written.

Even though the decoding worker is enabled for a PGD group, following
GUCs control the production and use of LCR per node. By default
these are `false`. For production and use of LCRs, enable the
decoding worker for the PGD group and set these GUCs to `true` on each of the nodes in the PGD group.

-   [`bdr.enable_wal_decoder`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrenable_wal_decoder) &mdash; When turned `false`, all WAL
    senders using LCRs restart to use WAL directly. When `true`
    along with the PGD group config, a decoding worker process is
    started to produce LCR and WAL Senders use LCR.
-   [`bdr.receive_lcr`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrreceive_lcr) &mdash; When `true` on the subscribing node, it requests WAL
    sender on the publisher node to use LCRs if available.

## Notes

As of now, a decoding worker decodes changes corresponding to the node where it's
running. A logical standby is sent changes from all the nodes in the PGD group
through a single source. Hence a WAL sender serving a logical standby can't
use LCRs right now.

A subscriber-only node receives changes from respective nodes directly. Hence
a WAL sender serving a subscriber-only node can use LCRs.

Even though LCRs are produced, the corresponding WALs are still retained similar
to the case when a decoding worker isn't enabled. In the future, it might be possible
to remove WAL corresponding the LCRs, if they aren't otherwise required.

For reference, the first 24 characters of an LCR file name are similar to those
in a WAL file name. The first 8 characters of the name are all '0' right now.
In the future, they are expected to represent the TimeLineId similar to the first 8
characters of a WAL segment file name. The following sequence of 16 characters
of the name is similar to the WAL segment number, which is used to track LCR
changes against the WAL stream.

However, logical changes are
reordered according to the commit order of the transactions they belong to.
Hence their placement in the LCR segments doesn't match the placement of
corresponding WAL in the WAL segments.

The set of last 16 characters represents the
subsegment number in an LCR segment. Each LCR file corresponds to a
subsegment. LCR files are binary and variable sized. The maximum size of an
LCR file can be controlled by `bdr.max_lcr_segment_file_size`, which
defaults to 1 GB.
