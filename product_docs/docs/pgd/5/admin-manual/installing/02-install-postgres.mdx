## Installing Postgres

You need to install Postgres on all the hosts.

An EDB account is required to use the [EDB Repos 2.0](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos) page where you can get installation instructions.
Select your platform and Postgres edition. 
You are presented with 2 steps of instructions. The first step covers how to configure the required package repository. The second step covers how to install the packages from that repository.

Run both steps.

## Worked example

This example installs EDB Postgres Advanced Server 16 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL 9).

### EDB account

You need an EDB account to install both Postgres and PGD.

Use your EDB account to sign in to the [EDB Repos 2.0](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos) page where you can select your platform. Then scroll down the list to select the Postgres version you want to install:

* EDB Postgres Advanced Server
* EDB Postgres Extended
* PostgreSQL

When you select the version of the Postgres server you want, two steps are displayed.


### 1: Configuring repositories

For step 1, you can choose to use the automated script or step through the manual install instructions that are displayed. Your EDB repository token is automatically inserted by the EDB Repos 2.0 site into these scripts. 
In the examples, it's shown as `XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`.

On each provisioned host, you either run the automatic repository installation script or use the manual installation steps. The automatic script looks like this: 

```shell
curl -1sLf 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/enterprise/setup.rpm.sh' | sudo -E bash
```

The manual installation steps look like this:

```shell
dnf install yum-utils 
rpm --import 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/enterprise/gpg.E71EB0829F1EF813.key'
curl -1sLf 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/enterprise/config.rpm.txt?distro=el&codename=9' > /tmp/enterprise.repo
dnf config-manager --add-repo '/tmp/enterprise.repo'
dnf -q makecache -y --disablerepo='*' --enablerepo='enterprisedb-enterprise'
```

### 2: Install Postgres

For step 2, run the command to install the packages.

```
sudo dnf -y install edb-as16-server
```
