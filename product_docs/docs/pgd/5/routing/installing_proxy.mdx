## Installing PGD Proxy

There are two ways to install and configure PGD Proxy to manage Postgres Distributed cluster. The easiest way to install and configure PGD Proxy is to use the EDB Trusted Platform Architect (TPA) utility
for cluster deployment and management.


### Installing through TPA

If PGD cluster is being deployed through TPA then it installs and configures PGD Proxy automatically as per recommended architecture. If you wish to install PGD Proxy on any other node in PGD cluster then, you simply need to attach the `pgd-proxy` role to that instance in TPA configuration file and set the `bdr_child_group` parameter as shown below before deploying. See [Trusted Platform Architect](/product_docs/docs/pgd/latest/tpa) for more information.
```yaml
- Name: proxy-a1
  location: a
  node: 4
  role:
  - pgd-proxy
  vars:
    bdr_child_group: group_a
  volumes:
  - device_name: /dev/sdf
    volume_type: none
```


### Installing manually

You can manually install the PGD Proxy on any Linux machine using `.deb` and `.rpm` packages available from the PGD repository. The package name is `edb-pgd5-proxy`. For example:

```sh
# for Debian
sudo apt-get install edb-pgd5-proxy
```


## Configuration

Proxy connects to BDR database for its internal operations, like getting proxy configs, getting write leader details, etc. Therefore, it needs a list of endpoints/dsn to connect to BDR nodes. Proxy expects these configurations in a local config file `pgd-proxy-config.yml`. Following is a functional example of `pgd-proxy-config.yml` file:

```yaml
log-level: debug
cluster:
  name: my_pgd_cluster
  endpoints:
    - "host=bdr-a1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=pgdproxy "
    - "host=bdr-a3 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=pgdproxy "
    - "host=bdr-a2 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=pgdproxy "
  proxy:
    name: "proxy-a1"
```

The `cluster.endpoints` and `cluster.proxy.name` are mandatory fields in the config file. Proxy always tries to connect to the first endpoint in the list, if it fails it tries the next endpoint and so on. The log level for PGD Proxy service can be set using the top level config parameter `log-level` as shown in the sample config. The valid values for `log-level` are `debug`, `info`, `warn` and  `error`.

PGD Proxy searches for `pgd-proxy-config.yml` in the following locations (precedence order - high to low):

   1. "-f config-file" (e.g. 'pgd-proxy -f /opt/my-config.yml')
   2. "/etc/edb/pgd-proxy" (default)
   3. "$HOME/.edb/pgd-proxy"

The `pgd-proxy-config.yml`, is located in the `/etc/edb/pgd-proxy` directory, by default. If you rename the file or move it to another location, specify the new name and location using the `-f` or `--config-file` flag in the `pgd-proxy.service` file.

### Proxy user

If the PGD Cluster is created by TPA, a postgres user `pgdproxy` for PGD Proxy and `route_dsn` at node level is set. If you wish to setup a different user then you need to create the user and set in the `endpoints` in config file manually.


## PGD Proxy service

PGD Proxy is preferably run as a systemd service. The `pgd-proxy` service unit file is located at `/etc/systemd/system/pgd-proxy.service` by default. Following is the sample service file for EDB Postgres Extended Server and Postgres Community.

**Note:** For EDB Postgres Advanced Server please change User and Group from `postgres` to `enterprisedb`.

```
[Unit]
Description=PGD Proxy

[Service]
Type=simple
User=postgres
Group=postgres
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=1s
ExecStart=/usr/bin/pgd-proxy -f /etc/edb/pgd-proxy/pgd-proxy-config.yml
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=pgd-proxy

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Use the below commands to manage `pgd-proxy` service
```
systemctl status pgd-proxy
systemctl stop pgd-proxy
systemctl restart pgd-proxy
```
