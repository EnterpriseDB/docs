## Installing PGD Proxy

There are two ways to install and configure PGD Proxy to manage Postgres Distributed cluster. The recommended way to install and configure PGD Proxy is to use the EDB Trusted Postgres Architect (TPA) utility for cluster deployment and management.

### Installing through TPA

If PGD cluster is being deployed through TPA then it installs and configures PGD Proxy automatically as per recommended architecture. If you wish to install PGD Proxy on any other node in PGD cluster then, you simply need to attach the `pgd-proxy` role to that instance in TPA configuration file and set the `bdr_child_group` parameter as shown below before deploying. See [Trusted Postgres Architect](../tpa) for more information.

```yaml
- Name: proxy-a1
  location: a
  node: 4
  role:
  - pgd-proxy
  vars:
    bdr_child_group: group_a
  volumes:
  - device_name: /dev/sdf
    volume_type: none
```

#### Configuration

Proxy connects to the BDR database for its internal operations, like getting proxy options, getting write leader details, etc. Therefore, it needs a list of endpoints/dsn to connect to BDR nodes. Proxy expects these configurations in a local config file `pgd-proxy-config.yml`. Following is a functional example of `pgd-proxy-config.yml` file:

```yaml
log-level: debug
cluster:
  name: cluster-name
  endpoints:
    - "host=bdr-a1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=pgdproxy "
    - "host=bdr-a3 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=pgdproxy "
    - "host=bdr-a2 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=pgdproxy "
  proxy:
    name: "proxy-a1"
```

By default, in the cluster created through TPA, `pgd-proxy-config.yml` is located in the `/etc/edb/pgd-proxy` directory. The PGD Proxy searches for `pgd-proxy-config.yml` in the following locations. Precedence order is high to low.

  1. `/etc/edb/pgd-proxy` (default)
  2. `$HOME/.edb/pgd-proxy`

If you rename the file or move it to another location, specify the new name and location using the optional `-f` or `--config-file` flag when starting a service. See the [sample service file](#pgd-proxy-service).

The log level for the PGD Proxy service can be set using the top level config parameter `log-level` as shown in the sample config. The valid values for `log-level` are `debug`, `info`, `warn` and  `error`.

The `cluster.endpoints` and `cluster.proxy.name` are mandatory fields in the config file. Proxy always tries to connect to the first endpoint in the list, if it fails it tries the next endpoint and so on.

Proxy uses endpoints given in the local config file only at the time of proxy startup. After that, proxy retrieves the list of actual endpoints (route_dsn) from the bdr catalog. Therefore, the node option - `route_dsn`, must be set for each bdr node. See [route_dsn](../routing#configuration) for more information.

#### Proxy user

The database user specified in the endpoint doesn’t need to be a superuser. Typically, in the TPA environment, `pgdproxy` is an OS user as well as database user with the `bdr_superuser` role.

#### PGD Proxy service

PGD Proxy is preferably run as a systemd service. The `pgd-proxy` service unit file is located at `/etc/systemd/system/pgd-proxy.service` by default. Following is the sample service file created by TPA.

```text
[Unit]
Description=PGD Proxy

[Service]
Type=simple
User=pgdproxy
Group=pgdproxy
Restart=on-failure
RestartSec=1s
ExecStart=/usr/bin/pgd-proxy -f /etc/edb/pgd-proxy/pgd-proxy-config.yml
StandardOutput=syslog
StandardError=syslog
SyslogIdentifier=pgd-proxy

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

Use the below commands to manage `pgd-proxy` service

```sh
systemctl status pgd-proxy
systemctl stop pgd-proxy
systemctl restart pgd-proxy
```

### Installing manually

You can manually install PGD Proxy on any Linux machine using `.deb` and `.rpm` packages available from the PGD repository. The package name is `edb-pgd5-proxy`. For example:

```sh
# for Debian
sudo apt-get install edb-pgd5-proxy
```
