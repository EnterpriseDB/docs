title: Migrating to Raft subgroups
---

This section assumes that you have an already running PGD installation and wish to introduce Raft subgroups to it.


## Migrating to Raft subgroups (using SQL only)

A number of configuration steps need to be taken to enable Raft subgroups to an existing cluster.

* The top-level group needs to be identified for all nodes in the PGD cluster. If you have an existing cluster, you should already have a top-level group that all nodes belong to.
* A subgroup needs to be created for each location. Use `bdr.create_node_group` with a parent_group_name argument and giving the top-level group as its value.
* Each node at each location should be added to their location’s subgroup using `bdr.switch_node_group()`.
* Each of the location’s subgroups should be altered to enable Raft for the group. Use `bdr.alter_node_group_option()` setting the `enable_raft` option to true.

#### How to enable subgroup Raft node group (using SQL only):

```sql
SELECT bdr.alter_node_group_option('$group_name', 'enable_raft', 'true');
```
