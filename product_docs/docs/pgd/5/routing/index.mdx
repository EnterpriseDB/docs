Managing application connections is an important part of high availability. PGD Proxy offers a way to manage connections to the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster. It acts as a proxy layer between the client application and the Postgres database.

* [PGD Proxy overview](/pgd/latest/routing/proxy) provides an overview of the PGD Proxy, its processes and how it interacts with the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

* [Installing the PGD Proxy daemon](/pgd/latest/routing/installing_proxy) covers installation of the PGD Proxy daemon on a host.

* [Configuring PGD Proxy](/pgd/latest/routing/configuration) details the three levels (group, node, and proxy) of configuration on a cluster that control how the PGD Proxy daemons behave.

* [Administering PGD Proxy](/pgd/latest/routing/administering) shows how to switch the write leader and manage the PGD Proxy.

* [Monitoring PGD Proxy](/pgd/latest/routing/monitoring) looks at how to monitor PGD Proxy through the cluster and at a daemon level.

* [Read-Only Routing](/pgd/latest/routing/readonly) explains how the read-only routing feature in PGD Proxy enables read scalability.

* [RAFT](/pgd/latest/routing/raft) provides an overview of the RAFT consensus mechanism used to coordinate PGD Proxy.
