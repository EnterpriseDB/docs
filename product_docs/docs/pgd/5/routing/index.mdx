Managing application connections is an important part of high availability.

Especially with asynchronous replication, having a consistent write lead node is
important to avoid conflicts and guarantee availability for the
application.

EDB Postgres Distributed provides a proxy layer called PGD Proxy, which is
normally installed in highly available configuration (at least two instances per
region).

The PGD Proxy connects to one of the EDB Postgres Distributed nodes and monitors
routing configuration changes as decided by the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.
It ensures that the connections are routed to the correct nodes consistently.

## Configuration

Configuring the routing is done through either SQL interfaces or through
PGD-CLI.

You can enable routing decisions by calling the `bdr.alter_node_group_option()` function.
For example:

```text
SELECT bdr.alter_node_group_option('region1-group', 'enable_proxy_routing', 'true')
```

You can disable it by setting the same option to `false`.

Additional group-level options affect the routing decisions:

- `route_writer_max_lag` &mdash; Maximum lag in bytes of the new write candidate to be
  selected as write leader. If no candidate passes this, no writer is
  selected automatically.
- `route_reader_max_lag` &mdash; Maximum lag in bytes for a node to be considered a viable
  read-only node. Currently reserved for future use.

Per-node configuration of routing is set using `bdr.alter_node_option()`. The
available options that affect routing are the following:

- `route_dsn` &mdash; The dsn used by proxy to connect to this node.
- `route_priority` &mdash; Relative routing priority of the node against other nodes in
  the same node group.
- `route_fence` &mdash; Whether the node is fenced from routing, that is, it can't receive connections
  from PGD Proxy.
- `route_writes` &mdash; Whether writes can be routed to this node, that is, whether the node
  can become write leader.
- `route_reads` &mdash; Whether read-only connections can be routed to this node. Currently
  reserved for future use.

You can also configure The proxies using SQL interfaces. You can add proxy configuration
using `bdr.create_proxy`. For example, `SELECT bdr.create_proxy('region1-proxy1', 'region1-group');`
adds the default configuration for a proxy named `region1-proxy1` that's a member
of PGD group `region1-group`. The name of the proxy given here must be same
as the name given in the proxy configuration file. You can remove a proxy configuration
using `SELECT bdr.drop_proxy('region1-proxy1')`. The proxy is
deactivated as a result.

You can configure options for each proxy using the `bdr.alter_proxy_option()` function.
The available options are:

- `listen_address` &mdash; Address for the proxy to listen on.
- `listen_port` &mdash; Port for the proxy to listen on.
- `max_client_conn` &mdash; Maximum number of connections for the proxy to accept.
- `max_server_conn` &mdash; Maximum number of connections the proxy can make to the
  Postgres node.
- `server_conn_timeout` &mdash; Connection timeout for server connections.
- `server_conn_keepalive` &mdash; Keepalive interval for server connections.
- `consensus_grace_period` &mdash; Duration for which proxy will continue to route even upon loss
of a Raft leader. If set to `0s` proxy will stop routing immediately.

The current configuration of every group is visible in the
`bdr.node_group_routing_config_summary` view. Similarly, the
`bdr.node_routing_config_summary` view shows current per-node routing
configuration. `bdr.proxy_config_summary` shows per-proxy configuration.

You can also do a switchover operation to explicitly change the node that's
the write leader. To do so, use the `bdr.routing_leadership_transfer()` function.
