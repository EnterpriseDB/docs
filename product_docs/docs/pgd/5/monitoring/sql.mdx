title: Monitoring through SQL
---

EDB Postgres Distributed provides several monitoring and statistics views that
are specific to its distributed nature. The standard Postgres monitoring
is also useful for monitoring EDB Postgres Distributed.

## Monitoring overview

A PGD group consists of multiple servers, often referred to as nodes. Monitor all of the
nodes to ensure the health of the whole group.

The bdr_monitor role can execute the `bdr.monitor` functions to provide an
assessment of PGD health using one of three levels:

-   `OK` &mdash; Often shown as green.
-   `WARNING` &mdash; Often shown as yellow.
-   `CRITICAL` &mdash; Often shown as red.
-   `UNKNOWN` &mdash; For unrecognized situations, often shown as red.

PGD also provides dynamic catalog views that show the instantaneous state of various
internal metrics. It also provides metadata catalogs that store the configuration
defaults and configuration changes the user requests. Some of those views
and tables are accessible by bdr_monitor or bdr_read_all_stats, but some contain
user or internal information that has higher security requirements.

PGD allows you to monitor each of the nodes individually or to monitor the
whole group by access to a single node. If you want to monitor each node individually, 
connect to each node and issue monitoring requests. If you want to monitor
the group from a single node, then use the views starting with `bdr.group` since these
requests make calls to other nodes to assemble a group-level information set.

If you were granted access to the `bdr.run_on_all_nodes()` function by
bdr_superuser, then you can make your own calls to all nodes.

## Monitoring node join and removal

By default, the node management functions wait for the join or part
operation to complete. You can turn waiting off using the respective
`wait_for_completion` function argument. If waiting is turned off,
then to see when a join or part operation finishes,
check the node state indirectly using `bdr.node_summary` and
`bdr.event_summary`.

When called, the helper function `bdr.wait_for_join_completion()` causes
a PostgreSQL session to pause until all outstanding node join operations
area complete.

This example shows the output of a `SELECT` query from `bdr.node_summary`. It
indicates that two nodes are active and another one is joining.

```
# SELECT node_name, interface_connstr, peer_state_name,
#     node_seq_id, node_local_dbname
# FROM bdr.node_summary;
-[ RECORD 1 ]-----+-----------------------------------------
node_name         | node1
interface_connstr | host=localhost dbname=postgres port=7432
peer_state_name   | ACTIVE
node_seq_id       | 1
node_local_dbname | postgres
-[ RECORD 2 ]-----+-----------------------------------------
node_name         | node2
interface_connstr | host=localhost dbname=postgres port=7433
peer_state_name   | ACTIVE
node_seq_id       | 2
node_local_dbname | postgres
-[ RECORD 3 ]-----+-----------------------------------------
node_name         | node3
interface_connstr | host=localhost dbname=postgres port=7434
peer_state_name   | JOINING
node_seq_id       | 3
node_local_dbname | postgres
```

Also, the table [`bdr.node_catchup_info`](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-visible/#bdrnode_catchup_info) gives information
on the catch-up state, which can be relevant to joining nodes or parting nodes.

When a node is parted, some nodes in the cluster might not receive
all the data from that parting node. So parting a node creates a temporary slot from
a node that already received that data and can forward it.

The `catchup_state` can be one of the following:

```
10 = setup
20 = start
30 = catchup
40 = done
```

## Monitoring Replication Peers

You use two main views for monitoring of replication activity:

-   [`bdr.node_slots`](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-visible/#bdrnode_slots) for monitoring outgoing replication
-   [`bdr.subscription_summary`](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-visible/#bdrsubscription_summary) for monitoring incoming replication

You can also obtain most of the information provided by `bdr.node_slots` by querying
the standard PostgreSQL replication monitoring views
[`pg_catalog.pg_stat_replication`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/monitoring-stats.html#PG-STAT-REPLICATION-VIEW)
and
[`pg_catalog.pg_replication_slots`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-replication-slots.html).

Each node has one PGD group slot that must never have a connection to it
and is very rarely be marked as active. This is normal and doesn't imply
something is down or disconnected. See [Replication slots](../node_management/replication_slots) in Node Management.

### Monitoring outgoing replication

You can use another view for monitoring of outgoing replication activity:

-   [`bdr.node_replication_rates`](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-visible/#bdrnode_replication_rates) for monitoring outgoing replication

The [`bdr.node_replication_rates`](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-visible/#bdrnode_replication_rates) view gives an overall picture of the outgoing
replication activity along with the catchup estimates for peer nodes,
specifically.

```
# SELECT * FROM bdr.node_replication_rates;
-[ RECORD 1 ]----+-----------
peer_node_id     | 112898766
target_name      | node1
sent_lsn         | 0/28AF99C8
replay_lsn       | 0/28AF99C8
replay_lag       | 00:00:00
replay_lag_bytes | 0
replay_lag_size  | 0 bytes
apply_rate       | 822
catchup_interval | 00:00:00
-[ RECORD 2 ]----+-----------
peer_node_id     | 312494765
target_name      | node3
sent_lsn         | 0/28AF99C8
replay_lsn       | 0/28AF99C8
replay_lag       | 00:00:00
replay_lag_bytes | 0
replay_lag_size  | 0 bytes
apply_rate       | 853
catchup_interval | 00:00:00
```

The `apply_rate` refers to the rate in bytes per second. It's the rate
at which the peer is consuming data from the local node. The `replay_lag` when
a node reconnects to the cluster is immediately set to zero. This information will be
fixed in a future release. As a workaround, we recommend using the `catchup_interval`
column that refers to the time required for the peer node to catch up to the
local node data. The other fields are also available from the [`bdr.node_slots`](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-visible/#bdrnode_slots)
view.

!!! Note
    This catalog is present only when the bdr-enterprise extension is installed.

Administrators can query [`bdr.node_slots`](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-visible/#bdrnode_slots) for outgoing replication from the
local node. It shows information about replication status of all other nodes
in the group that are known to the current node as well as any additional
replication slots created by PGD on the current node.

```
# SELECT node_group_name, target_dbname, target_name, slot_name, active_pid,
#     catalog_xmin, client_addr, sent_lsn, replay_lsn, replay_lag,
#     replay_lag_bytes, replay_lag_size
# FROM bdr.node_slots;
-[ RECORD 1 ]---+----------------------------
node_group_name | bdrgroup
target_dbname   | postgres
target_name     | node3
slot_name       | bdr_postgres_bdrgroup_node3
active_pid      | 15089
catalog_xmin    | 691
client_addr     | 127.0.0.1
sent_lsn        | 0/23F7B70
replay_lsn      | 0/23F7B70
replay_lag      | [NULL]
replay_lag_bytes| 120
replay_lag_size | 120 bytes
-[ RECORD 2 ]---+----------------------------
node_group_name | bdrgroup
target_dbname   | postgres
target_name     | node2
slot_name       | bdr_postgres_bdrgroup_node2
active_pid      | 15031
catalog_xmin    | 691
client_addr     | 127.0.0.1
sent_lsn        | 0/23F7B70
replay_lsn      | 0/23F7B70
replay_lag      | [NULL]
replay_lag_bytes| 84211
replay_lag_size | 82 kB
```

Because PGD is a mesh network, to get the full view of lag in the
cluster, you must execute this query on all nodes participating.

`replay_lag_bytes` reports the difference in WAL positions between the local
server's current WAL write position and `replay_lsn`, the last position
confirmed replayed by the peer node. `replay_lag_size` is a human-readable
form of the same. It's important to understand that WAL usually contains a lot
of writes that aren't replicated but still count in `replay_lag_bytes`,
including, for example:

-  `VACUUM` activity
-  Index changes 
-  Writes associated with other databases on the same node
-  Writes for tables that are not part of a replication set

So the lag in bytes reported here isn't the amount of
data that must be replicated on the wire to bring the peer node up to date,
only the amount of server-side WAL that must be processed.

Similarly, `replay_lag` isn't a measure of how long the peer node takes to
catch up or how long it takes to replay from its current position to the
write position at the time `bdr.node_slots` was queried. It measures the delay
between when the peer confirmed the most recent commit and the current
wall-clock time. We suggest that you monitor `replay_lag_bytes` and `replay_lag_size`
or `catchup_interval` in `bdr.node_replication_rates`, as this column is set to
zero immediately after the node reconnects.

The lag in both bytes and time doesn't advance while logical replication is
streaming a transaction. It changes only when a commit is replicated. So the lag 
tends to "sawtooth," rising as a transaction is streamed and then falling again
as the peer node commits it, flushes it, and sends confirmation. The reported
LSN positions "stair-step" instead of advancing smoothly, for similar
reasons.

When replication is disconnected (`active` = `'f'`), the `active_pid` column
is `NULL`, as is `client_addr` and the other fields that make sense only
with an active connection. The `state` field is `'disconnected'`. The
`_lsn` fields are the same as the `confirmed_flush_lsn`, since that's the
last position that the client is known for certain to have replayed to and saved.
The `_lag` fields show the elapsed time between the most recent confirmed
flush on the client and the current time. The `_lag_size` and `_lag_bytes`
fields report the distance between `confirmed_flush_lsn` and the local
server's current WAL insert position.

!!! Note
    It's normal for `restart_lsn` to be behind the other `lsn` columns.
    This doesn't indicate a problem with replication or a peer node lagging. The
    `restart_lsn` is the position that PostgreSQL's internal logical decoding must
    be reading WAL at if interrupted. It generally reflects the position of the
    oldest transaction that's not yet replicated and flushed. A very old
    `restart_lsn` can make replication slow to restart after disconnection and
    force retention of more WAL than is desirable, but it's otherwise harmless.
    If you're concerned, look for very long-running transactions and forgotten
    prepared transactions.

### Monitoring incoming replication

You can monitor incoming replication (also called subscriptions) by querying
the `bdr.subscription_summary` view. This query shows the list of known subscriptions
to other nodes in the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster and the state of the replication worker:

```
# SELECT node_group_name, origin_name, sub_enabled, sub_slot_name,
#     subscription_status
# FROM bdr.subscription_summary;
-[ RECORD 1 ]-------+----------------------------
node_group_name     | bdrgroup
origin_name         | node2
sub_enabled         | t
sub_slot_name       | bdr_postgres_bdrgroup_node1
subscription_status | replicating
-[ RECORD 2 ]-------+----------------------------
node_group_name     | bdrgroup
origin_name         | node3
sub_enabled         | t
sub_slot_name       | bdr_postgres_bdrgroup_node1
subscription_status | replicating
```

### Monitoring WAL senders using LCR

If the [decoding worker](../node_management/decoding_worker/) is enabled, you can monitor information about the
current logical change record (LCR) file for each WAL sender 
using the function [`bdr.wal_sender_stats()`](/pgd/latest/reference/functions/#bdrwal_sender_stats). For example:

```
postgres=# SELECT * FROM bdr.wal_sender_stats();
   pid   | is_using_lcr |       decoder_slot_name       |              lcr_file_name
---------+--------------+-------------------------------+------------------------------------------
 2059904 | f            |                               |
 2059909 | t            | bdr_postgres_bdrgroup_decoder | 0000000000000000000000140000000000000000
 2059916 | t            | bdr_postgres_bdrgroup_decoder | 0000000000000000000000140000000000000000
(3 rows)
```

If `is_using_lcr` is `FALSE`, `decoder_slot_name`/`lcr_file_name` is `NULL`.
This is the case if the decoding worker isn't enabled or the WAL sender is
serving a [logical standby](../node_management/logical_standby_nodes/).

Also, you can monitor information about the decoding worker using the function
[`bdr.get_decoding_worker_stat()`](/pgd/latest/reference/functions/#bdrget_decoding_worker_stat). For example:

```
postgres=# SELECT * FROM bdr.get_decoding_worker_stat();
   pid   | decoded_upto_lsn | waiting | waiting_for_lsn
---------+------------------+---------+-----------------
 1153091 | 0/1E5EEE8        | t       | 0/1E5EF00
(1 row)
```

## Monitoring PGD replication workers

All PGD workers show up in the system view `bdr.stat_activity`,
which has the same columns and information content as
[pg_stat_activity](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html#PG-STAT-ACTIVITY-VIEW).
So this view offers these insights into the state of a PGD system:

-   The wait_event column has enhanced information, if
    the reason for waiting is related to PGD.
-   The `query` column is blank in PGD workers, except
    when a writer process is executing DDL.

The `bdr.workers` view shows PGD worker-specific details that aren't
available from `bdr.stat_activity`.

The view `bdr.event_summary` shows the last error (if any) reported by any worker
that has a problem continuing the work. This information is persistent, so
it's important to note the time of the error and not just its existence.
Most errors are transient, and PGD workers will retry
the failed operation.

## Monitoring PGD writers

Another system view, `bdr.writers`, monitors writer activities.
This view shows only the current status of writer workers. It includes:

-   `sub_name` to identify the subscription that the writer belongs to
-   `pid` of the writer process
-   `streaming_allowed` to know if the writer supports applying
    in-progress streaming transactions
-   `is_streaming` to know if the writer is currently applying a
    streaming transaction
-   `commit_queue_position` to check the position of the writer in the
    commit queue

PGD honors commit ordering by following the same commit order as
happened on the origin. In case of parallel writers, multiple writers
might apply different transactions at the same time. The
`commit_queue_position` shows the order in which they will commit. Value `0`
means that the writer is the first one to commit. Value `-1` means that
the commit position isn't yet known, which can happen for a streaming
transaction or when the writer isn't currently applying any transaction.

## Monitoring global locks

The global lock, which is currently used only for DDL replication, is a heavyweight
lock that exists across the whole PGD group.

There are currently two types of global locks:

-   DDL lock, used for serializing all DDL operations on permanent
    (not temporary) objects (that is, tables) in the database
-   DML relation lock, used for locking out writes to relations during DDL
    operations that change the relation definition

You can create either or both entry types for the same transaction, depending on
the type of DDL operation and the value of the `bdr.ddl_locking` setting.

Global locks held on the local node are visible in the [`bdr.global_locks`](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-visible/#bdrglobal_locks) view. 
This view shows the type of the lock. For
relation locks, it shows the relation that's being locked, the PID holding the
lock (if local), and whether the lock was globally granted. In case
of global advisory locks, `lock_type` column shows `GLOBAL_LOCK_ADVISORY`, and
`relation` column shows the advisory keys on which the lock is acquired.

This example shows the output of `bdr.global_locks` while running an
`ALTER TABLE` statement with `bdr.ddl_locking = on`:

```
# SELECT lock_type, relation, pid FROM bdr.global_locks;
-[ RECORD 1 ]--------------
lock_type | GLOBAL_LOCK_DDL
relation  | [NULL]
pid       | 15534
-[ RECORD 2 ]--------------
lock_type | GLOBAL_LOCK_DML
relation  | someschema.sometable
pid       | 15534
```

See [Catalogs](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-visible/) for details on all fields, including lock
timing information.

## Monitoring conflicts

Replication [conflicts](../consistency/conflicts) can arise when multiple nodes make
changes that affect the same rows in ways that can interact with each other.
Monitor the PGD system to identify conflicts and, where possible, make application changes to eliminate the conflicts or make them less frequent.

By default, all conflicts are logged to `bdr.conflict_history`. Since this log
contains full details of conflicting data, the rows are protected by
row-level security to ensure they're visible only by
owners of replicated tables. Owners should expect conflicts and analyze them
to see which, if any, might be considered as problems to resolve.

For monitoring purposes, use `bdr.conflict_history_summary`, which doesn't
contain user data. This example shows a query to count the number of conflicts
seen in the current day using an efficient query plan:

```sql
SELECT count(*)
FROM bdr.conflict_history_summary
WHERE local_time > date_trunc('day', current_timestamp)
  AND local_time < date_trunc('day', current_timestamp + '1 day');
```

## Apply statistics

PGD collects statistics about replication apply, both for each subscription
and for each table.

Two monitoring views exist: `bdr.stat_subscription` for subscription statistics
and `bdr.stat_relation` for relation statistics. These views both provide:

-   Number of INSERTs/UPDATEs/DELETEs/TRUNCATEs replicated
-   Block accesses and cache hit ratio
-   Total I/O time for read/write
-   Number of in-progress transactions streamed to file
-   Number of in-progress transactions streamed to writers
-   Number of in-progress streamed transactions committed/aborted

For relations only, `bdr.stat_relation` also includes:

-   Total time spent processing replication for the relation
-   Total lock wait time to acquire lock (if any) for the relation (only)

For subscriptions only, `bdr.stat_subscription` includes:

-   Number of COMMITs/DDL replicated for the subscription
-   Number of times this subscription has connected upstream

Tracking of these statistics is controlled by the PGD GUCs
`bdr.track_subscription_apply` and `bdr.track_relation_apply`,
respectively.

The following shows the example output from these:

```sql
# SELECT sub_name, nconnect, ninsert, ncommit, nupdate, ndelete, ntruncate, nddl
FROM bdr.stat_subscription;
-[ RECORD 1 ]----------------------------------
sub_name  | bdr_regression_bdrgroup_node1_node2
nconnect  | 3
ninsert   | 10
ncommit   | 5
nupdate   | 0
ndelete   | 0
ntruncate | 0
nddl      | 2
```

In this case, the subscription connected three times to the upstream, inserted
10 rows, and performed two DDL commands inside five transactions.

You can reset the stats counters for these views to zero using the functions
`bdr.reset_subscription_stats` and `bdr.reset_relation_stats`.

## Standard PostgreSQL statistics views

Statistics on table and index usage are normally updated by the downstream
master. This is essential for the correct function of
[autovacuum](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/routine-vacuuming.html).
If there are no local writes on the downstream master and statistics haven't been
reset, these two views show corresponding results between
upstream and downstream:

-   `pg_stat_user_tables`
-   `pg_statio_user_tables`

!!! Note
    We don't necessarily expect the upstream table statistics to
    be *similar* to the downstream ones. We only expect them to *change*
    by the same amounts. Consider the example of a table whose statistics
    show 1M inserts and 1M updates. When a new node joins the PGD group,
    the statistics for the same table in the new node show 1M inserts
    and zero updates. However, from that moment, the upstream and
    downstream table statistics change by the same amounts because
    all changes on one side are replicated to the other side.

Since indexes are used to apply changes, the identifying indexes on the
downstream side might appear more heavily used with workloads that perform
`UPDATE` and `DELETE` than non-identifying indexes are.

The built-in index monitoring views are:

-   `pg_stat_user_indexes`
-   `pg_statio_user_indexes`

All these views are discussed in detail in the
[PostgreSQL documentation on the statistics views](http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/monitoring-stats.html#MONITORING-STATS-VIEWS-TABLE).

## Monitoring PGD versions

PGD allows running different Postgres versions as well as different
BDR extension versions across the nodes in the same cluster. This capability is useful for
upgrading.

The view `bdr.group_versions_details` uses the function
`bdr.run_on_all_nodes()` to retrieve Postgres and BDR extension versions from all 
nodes at the same time. For example:

```sql
bdrdb=# SELECT node_name, postgres_version, bdr_version
        FROM bdr.group_versions_details;
 node_name | postgres_version | bdr_version
-----------+------------------+-------------
 node1     | 15.2.0           | 5.0.0
 node2     | 15.2.0           | 5.0.0
```

The recommended setup is to try to have all nodes running the same (and
latest) versions as soon as possible. We recommend
that the cluster doesn't run different versions of the  BDR extension for too long.

For monitoring purposes, we recommend the following alert levels:

-   status=UNKNOWN, message=This node is not part of any PGD group
-   status=OK, message=All nodes are running same PGD versions
-   status=WARNING, message=There is at least 1 node that is not accessible
-   status=WARNING, message=There are node(s) running different PGD versions
    when compared to other nodes

The described behavior is implemented in the function
`bdr.monitor_group_versions()`, which uses PGD version
information returned from the view `bdr.group_version_details`
to provide a cluster-wide version check. For example:

```sql
bdrdb=# SELECT * FROM bdr.monitor_group_versions();
 status |                message
--------+-----------------------------------------
 OK     | All nodes are running same BDR versions
```

## Monitoring Raft consensus

Raft consensus must be working cluster-wide at all times. The impact
of running a EDB Postgres Distributed cluster without Raft consensus working might be as
follows:

-   The replication of PGD data changes might still work correctly.
-   Global DDL/DML locks doesn't work.
-   Galloc sequences eventually run out of chunks.
-   Eager Replication doesn't work.
-   Cluster maintenance operations (join node, part node, promote standby)
    are still allowed, but they might not finish (hanging instead).
-   Node statuses might not be correctly synced among the PGD nodes.
-   PGD group replication slot doesn't advance LSN and thus keeps WAL files on
    disk.

The view `bdr.group_raft_details` uses the functions
`bdr.run_on_all_nodes()` and `bdr.get_raft_status()` to retrieve Raft
consensus status from all nodes at the same time. For example:

```sql
bdrdb=# SELECT node_id, node_name, state, leader_id
FROM bdr.group_raft_details;
  node_id   | node_name | node_group_name |     state     | leader_id
------------+-----------+-----------------+---------------+------------
 1148549230 | node1     | top_group       | RAFT_LEADER   | 1148549230
 3367056606 | node2     | top_group       | RAFT_FOLLOWER | 1148549230
```

Raft consensus is working correctly if all of these
conditions are met:

-   A valid state (`RAFT_LEADER` or `RAFT_FOLLOWER`) is defined on all
    nodes.
-   Only one of the nodes is the `RAFT_LEADER`.
-   The `leader_id` is the same on all rows and must match the `node_id`
    of the row where `state = RAFT_LEADER`.

From time to time, Raft consensus starts a new election to define a
new `RAFT_LEADER`. During an election, there might be an intermediary
situation where there's no `RAFT_LEADER`, and some of the nodes consider
themselves as `RAFT_CANDIDATE`. The whole election can't take longer
than `bdr.raft_election_timeout` (by default it's set to 6 seconds). If
the query above returns an in-election situation, then wait for
`bdr.raft_election_timeout`, and run the query again. If after
`bdr.raft_election_timeout` has passed and some the listed conditions are
still not met, then Raft consensus isn't working.

Raft consensus might not be working correctly on only a single node.
For example, one of the nodes doesn't recognize the current leader and
considers itself as a `RAFT_CANDIDATE`. In this case, it's important to
make sure that:

-   All PGD nodes are accessible to each other through both regular and
    replication connections (check file `pg_hba.conf`).
-   PGD versions are the same on all nodes.
-   `bdr.raft_election_timeout` is the same on all nodes.

In some cases, especially if nodes are geographically distant from each
other or network latency is high, the default value of
`bdr.raft_election_timeout` (6 seconds) might not be enough. If Raft
consensus is still not working even after making sure everything is
correct, consider increasing `bdr.raft_election_timeout` to 30
seconds on all nodes. For PGD 3.6.11 and later, setting
`bdr.raft_election_timeout` requires only a server reload.

Given how Raft consensus affects cluster operational tasks, and also as
Raft consensus is directly responsible for advancing the group slot,
monitoring alert levels are defined as follows:

-   status=UNKNOWN, message=This node is not part of any PGD group
-   status=OK, message=Raft Consensus is working correctly
-   status=WARNING, message=There is at least 1 node that is not accessible
-   status=WARNING, message=There are node(s) as RAFT_CANDIDATE, an
    election might be in progress
-   status=WARNING, message=There is no RAFT_LEADER, an election might be
    in progress
-   status=CRITICAL, message=There is a single node in Raft Consensus
-   status=CRITICAL, message=There are node(s) as RAFT_CANDIDATE while a
    RAFT_LEADER is defined
-   status=CRITICAL, message=There are node(s) following a leader different
    than the node set as RAFT_LEADER

The described behavior is implemented in the function
`bdr.monitor_group_raft()`, which uses Raft consensus status
information returned from the view `bdr.group_raft_details`
to provide a cluster-wide Raft check. For example:

```sql
bdrdb=# SELECT * FROM bdr.monitor_group_raft();
node_group_name | status |               message
----------------|--------+-------------------------------------
myroup          | OK     | Raft Consensus is working correctly
```

## Monitoring replication slots

Each PGD node keeps:

-   One replication slot per active PGD peer
-   One group replication slot

For example:

```sql
bdrdb=# SELECT slot_name, database, active, confirmed_flush_lsn
FROM pg_replication_slots ORDER BY slot_name;
        slot_name         | database | active | confirmed_flush_lsn
--------------------------+----------+--------+---------------------
 bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup       | bdrdb    | f      | 0/3110A08
 bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup_node2 | bdrdb    | t      | 0/31F4670
 bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup_node3 | bdrdb    | t      | 0/31F4670
 bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup_node4 | bdrdb    | t      | 0/31F4670
```

Peer slot names follow the convention `bdr_<DATABASE>_<GROUP>_<PEER>`,
while the PGD group slot name follows the convention
`bdr_<DATABASE>_<GROUP>`. You can access the group slot using the function
`bdr.local_group_slot_name()`.

Peer replication slots must be active on all nodes at all times.
If a peer replication slot isn't active, then it might mean either:

-   The corresponding peer is shut down or not accessible.
-   PGD replication is broken.

Grep the log file for `ERROR` or `FATAL`, and also check `bdr.event_summary` on
all nodes. The root cause might be, for example, an incompatible DDL was
executed with DDL replication disabled on one of the nodes.

The PGD group replication slot is, however, inactive most of the time. PGD
maintains this slot and advances its LSN when all other peers already
consumed the corresponding transactions. Consequently, it's not necessary to
monitor the status of the group slot.

The function `bdr.monitor_local_replslots()` provides a summary of whether all
PGD node replication slots are working as expected. For example:

```sql
bdrdb=# SELECT * FROM bdr.monitor_local_replslots();
 status |                    message
--------+-------------------------------------------------
 OK     | All BDR replication slots are working correctly
```

One of the following status summaries is returned:

-   `UNKNOWN`: `This node is not part of any BDR group`
-   `OK`: `All BDR replication slots are working correctly`
-   `OK`: `This node is part of a subscriber-only group`
-   `CRITICAL`: `There is at least 1 BDR replication slot which is inactive`
-   `CRITICAL`: `There is at least 1 BDR replication slot which is missing`

## Monitoring transaction COMMITs

By default, PGD transactions commit only on the local node. In that case,
transaction `COMMIT` is processed quickly.

You can use PGD with standard PostgreSQL synchronous replication. 
PGD also provides two new transaction commit modes: CAMO and eager
replication. Each of these modes adds robustness
features, though at the expense of additional latency at `COMMIT`.
You can monitor the additional time at `COMMIT` dynamically using the
`bdr.stat_activity` catalog, where processes report different `wait_event`
states. A transaction in `COMMIT` waiting for confirmations from one or
more synchronous standbys reports a `SyncRep` wait event, whereas the
two new modes report `EagerRep`.
