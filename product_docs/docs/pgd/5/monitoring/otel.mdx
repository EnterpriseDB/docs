title: OpenTelemetry Integration
---

EDB Postgres Distributed can be configured to report monitoring information
as well as traces to the OpenTelemetry collector.

Several resource attributes are filled by EDB Postgres Distributed OTEL collector.
These are attached to all metrics and traces:

 - The `service.name` is configurable via `bdr.otel_service_name` configuration setting.
 - The `service.namespace` is always set to `edb_postgres_distributed`.
 - The `service.instance.id` is always set to system identifier of the Postgres instance.
 - The `service.version` is set to current version of the BDR extension loaded in the Postgresql instance.

## Metrics collection

The metric collection is enable automatically when configuration option
`bdr.metrics_otel_http_url` is set to non-empty URL.

Different kinds of metrics are being collected as seen bellow.

### Generic metrics

| Metric name | Type | Labels | Description
| ----------- | ---- | ------ | -----------
| pg_backends_by_state | gauge | conn_state - idle, active, idle in transaction, fastpath functioncall, idle in transaction (aborted), disabled, undefined | Number of backends in a given state
| pg_oldest_xact_start | gauge | | Oldest transaction start time
| pg_oldest_activity_start | gauge | | Oldest query start time
| pg_waiting_backends | gauge | wait_type - LWLock, Lock, BufferPin, Activity, Client, Extension, IPC, Timeout, IO, ??? (for unknown) | Number of currently waiting backends by wait type
| pg_start_time | gauge | | Timestamp at which the server has started
| pg_reload_time | gauge | | Timestamp at which the server has last reloaded configuration


### Replication metrics

| Metric name | Type | Labels | Description
| ----------- | ---- | ------ | -----------
| bdr_slot_sent_lag | gauge | slot_name - name of a slot | Current sent lag in bytes for each replication slot
| bdr_slot_write_lag | gauge | slot_name - name of a slot | Current write lag in bytes for each replication slot
| bdr_slot_flush_lag | gauge | slot_name - name of a slot | Current flush lag in bytes for each replication slot
| bdr_slot_apply_lag | gauge | slot_name - name of a slot | Current apply lag in bytes for each replication slot
| bdr_subscription_receive_lsn | gauge | sub_name - name of subscription | Current received LSN for each subscription
| bdr_subscription_flush_lsn | gauge | sub_name - name of subscription | Current flushed LSN for each subscription
| bdr_subscription_apply_lsn | gauge | sub_name - name of subscription | Current applied LSN for each subscription
| bdr_subscription_receiver | gauge | sub_name - name of subscription | Whether subscription receiver is currently running (1) or not (0)

### Consensus metric

| Metric name | Type | Labels | Description
| ----------- | ---- | ------ | -----------
| bdr_raft_state | gauge | state_str - RAFT_FOLLOWER, RAFT_CANDIDATE, RAFT_LEADER, RAFT_STOPPED | Raft state of the consensus on this node
| bdr_raft_protocol_version | gauge | | Consensus protocol version used by this node
| bdr_raft_leader_node | gauge | | Id of a node that this node considers to be current leader
| bdr_raft_nodes | gauge | | Total number of nodes that participate in consensus (includes learner/non-voting nodes)
| bdr_raft_voting_nodes | gauge | | Number of actual voting nodes in consensus
| bdr_raft_term | gauge | | Current raft term this node is on
| bdr_raft_commit_index | gauge | | Raft commit index committed by this node
| bdr_raft_apply_index | gauge | | Raft commit index applied by this node

## Tracing

Tracing collection to OpenTelemetry requires `bdr.trace_otel_http_url` to be
configured and tracing itself to be enabled using `bdr.trace_enable`.

The tracing is limited to only some subsystems at the moment, primarily to the
cluster management functionality. The following spans can be seen in traces:

| Span name | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| create_node_group | Group creation
| alter_node_group_config | Change of group config option(s)
| alter_node_config | Change of node config option
| join_node_group | Node joining a group
| join_send_remote_request | Join source sending the join request on behalf of the joining node
| add_camo_pair | Add CAMO pair
| alter_camo_pair | Change CAMO pair
| remove_camo_pair | Delete CAMO pair
| alter_commit_scope | Change commit scope definition (either create new or update existing)
| alter_proxy_config | Change config for PGD-Proxy instance (either create new or update existing)
| walmsg_global_lock_send | Send global locking WAL message
| walmsg_global_lock_recv | Received global locking WAL message
| ddl_epoch_apply | Global locking epoch apply (ensure cluster is synchronized enough for new epoch to start)
| walmsg_catchup | Catchup during node removal WAL message
| raft_send_appendentries | Internal Raft book keeping message
| raft_recv_appendentries | Internal Raft book keeping message
| raft_request | Raft request execution
| raft_query | Raft query execution
| msgb_send | Consensus messaging layer message
| msgb_recv_receive | Consensus messaging layer message
| msgb_recv_deliver | Consensus messaging layer message delivery
| preprocess_ddl | DDL command preprocessing

## TLS support

The metrics and tracing endpoints can be either HTTP or HTTPS. It's possible
to configure paths to the CA bundle, client key, and client certificate using
`bdr.otel_https_ca_path`, `bdr.otel_https_key_path`, and `bdr.otel_https_cert_path`
configuration options.
