The following steps set up EDB Postgres Distributed with an Always On Single Location
architecture using Amazon EC2.

## Introducing TPA and PGD

We created TPA to make the installation and management of various Postgres configurations easily repeatable. TPA orchestrates the creation and deployment of Postgres. In this quick start, we install TPA first. If you already have TPA installed, you can skip those steps. TPA can be used, and re-used, to deploy various configurations of Postgres clusters.

PGD is a multi-master replicating implementation of Postgres designed for high performance and availability. The installation of PGD is orchestrated by TPA. We will get TPA to generate a configuration file for a PGD demonstration cluster. This cluster uses Amazon EC2 instances to host the cluster's nodes: three replicating database nodes, two connection proxies and one backup node. We can then use TPA to provision and deploy the required configuration and software to each node.

## Preparation

!!! Note
This set of steps is specifically for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on Intel/AMD processors.  
!!!

### EDB account

You'll need an EDB account in order to install both TPA *and* PGD. 

[Sign up for a free EDB account](https://www.enterprisedb.com/accounts/register) if you don't already have one - this gives you a trial subscription to EDB's software repositories. 

Once you have registered, or if you are already registered, go to the [EDB Repos 2.0](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) page where you can obtain your "repo token". 

On your first visit to this page you have to select **Request Access** to generate your "repo token". Copy the token using the Copy Token icon and store it safely. 

### Install curl

We use the `curl` command to retrieve installation scripts from repositories. On Ubuntu, this is not installed by default. To test if it is present, run `curl` in the terminal. 

```console
$ curl
Command 'curl' not found, but can be installed with:
sudo apt install curl
```

If not found, run:
```
sudo apt -y install curl
```

### Setting environment variables

First, set the `EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN` environment variable to the value of your EDB repo token, obtained in the previous [EDB Account](#edb-account) step.

```shell
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=<your-repo-token>
```

This can be added to your `.bashrc` script (or similar shell profile) to ensure it is always set.

### Configure the repository

All the software needed for this example is available from the Postgres Distributed package repository. We download and run a script to configure the Postgres Distributed repository. This repository also contains the TPA packages.

```shell
curl -1sLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/postgres_distributed/setup.deb.sh" | sudo -E bash
``` 

## Installing Trusted Postgres Architect (TPA)

We are using TPA to provision and deploy PGD. If you have previously installed TPA, you can move on to the [next step](#installing-pgd-using-tpa). You'll find full instructions for installing TPA in the [Trusted Postgres Architect documentation](/tpa/latest/INSTALL/), which we've included here for convenience:

### Linux environment

[TPA supports several distributions of Linux](/tpa/latest/INSTALL/) as a host platform. These examples are written for Ubuntu 22.04, but steps are similar for other supported platforms.

### Install the TPA package

```shell
sudo apt install tpaexec
```

### Configuring TPA

We now need to configure TPA which configures TPA's Python environment. Just call `tpaexec` with the command `setup`.

```shell
sudo /opt/EDB/TPA/bin/tpaexec setup
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/EDB/TPA/bin
```

You can add the export command to your shell's profile.

### Testing the TPA installation

You can verify TPA is correctly installed by running `selftest`.

```shell
tpaexec selftest
```
TPA is now installed.

### AWS CLI

TPA uses the AWS CLI to provision and deploy. [Install the CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), and then [configure credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) for an IAM user with sufficient access rights. The [TPA AWS Platform topic](/tpa/latest/platform-aws/) details the permissions that you'll need.



## Installing PGD using TPA

### Generating a configuration file

Run the [`tpaexec configure`](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-configure/) command to generate a configuration folder. 

```shell-session
tpaexec configure democluster \
  --architecture PGD-Always-ON \
  --platform aws \
  --epas \
  --location-names eu-west-1 \
  --active-locations eu-west-1 \
  --data-nodes-per-location 3 \
  --no-git \
  --hostnames-unsorted
```
We included options to specify using AWS, a single location, and three data nodes running [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/). By default, PGD also configures two [PGD Proxy](routing/proxy/) nodes and a [Barman](backup#physical-backup) node for backup. Rocky Linux is the default image for all nodes.

!!! Note Deployment platforms
    Numerous other Linux platforms are supported as deployment targets for PGD - view [the EDB Postgres Distributed compatibility table](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility) for details.
    
    Observe that we don't have to deploy PGD to the same platform we're using to run TPA!

We set the notional location of the nodes to `eu-west-1` using `--location-names`. We then activate the PGD proxies in that location using `--active-locations` set to the same location.

By default, TPA will use t3.micro instances on AWS - this is both sufficient for this demonstration and also suitable for use with an [AWS free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) account.

!!! Danger AWS free tier limitations
    AWS free tier limitations for EC2 are based on hours of instance usage. Depending on how much time you spend testing, you may exceed these limits and incur charges. 

By default, TPA commits configuration changes to a Git repository. For this example, we don't need to do that so we pass the `--no-git` flag.

Finally, we ask TPA to generate repeatable hostnames for the nodes by passing `--hostnames-unsorted`.

This creates a subdirectory in the current working directory called `democluster` containing the `config.yml` configuration file TPA uses to create the cluster. You can view it using:

```shell
less democluster/config.yml
```

    - View the full set of available options by running,
      ```shell
      tpaexec configure --architecture PGD-Always-ON --help
      ``` 
    - More details on PGD-Always-ON configuration options in [Deploying with TPA](tpa)
    - [`tpaexec configure`](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-configure/) in the Trusted Postgres Architect documentation
    - [AWS platform](/tpa/latest/aws/) in the Trusted Postgres Architect documentation

## Provisioning the cluster:
   
Now we allocate the resources needed to run the configuration we have just created, using the [`tpaexec provision`](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-provision/) command.
   
```shell
tpaexec provision democluster
```

Since we specified AWS as the platform (the default platform), TPA provisions EC2 instances, VPCs, subnets, routing tables, internet gateways, security groups, EBS volumes, elastic IPs, and so on.

TPA will also prompt you to confirm the creation of an S3 bucket (because we didn't specify an existing one when configuring). 

!!! Danger Remember to remove the bucket when you're done testing!
    TPA will not remove the bucket that it creates in this step when you later deprovision the cluster. Take note of the name now, so that you can be sure to remove it later!

!!! SeeAlso
    - [`tpaexec provision`](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-provision/) in the Trusted Postgres Architect documentation

## Deploying the cluster: 

With configuration in place and infrastructure provisioned, we can now [deploy](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-deploy/) the distributed cluster.

```shell
tpaexec deploy democluster
```

TPA applies the configuration, installing the needed packages and setting up the actual EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

!!! Tip
    If you see a failure while processing the `barman/first_backup` task, retry this step. Depending on the speed of your instances, delays in deployment, phase of the moon and position of the stars... 40 retries may just not be enough for initialization to complete in time. 

!!! SeeAlso
    - [`tpaexec deploy`](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-deploy/) in the Trusted Postgres Architect documentation

## Using the cluster

With the cluster deployed, we can do a quick hands-on test with psql. For convenience, we use the barman instance to launch psql and connect to a proxy instance. As we saw previously in config.yml, TPA has assigned the name `karakul` to the barman instance, and `kapok` to the first proxy.

```shell
cd democluster
ssh -F ssh_config karakul 
sudo su - barman
psql -h kapok -p 6432 -U barman bdrdb
```

## Deprovisioning the cluster

When you're done testing the cluster, you'll want to deprovision it. This will tear down the EC2 instances, etc.:

```shell
tpaexec deprovision democluster
```
