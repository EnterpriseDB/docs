title: "Application Schema Upgrades"
---

Similar to the upgrade of EDB Postgres Distributed itself, there are two
approaches to upgrading the application schema.  The simpler option is to
stop all applications affected, preform the schema upgrade, and restart the
application upgraded to use the new schema variant. Again, this
imposes some downtime.

To eliminate this downtime, EDB Postgres Distributed offers useful tools to
perform a rolling application schema upgrade.

This section describes some of the recommendations and tips that make the
application schema upgrade less impactful for the cluster.

### Rolling Application Schema Upgrades

By default, DDL will automatically be sent to all nodes. This can be
controlled manually, as described in
[DDL Replication](../ddl/), which
could be used to create differences between database schemas across nodes.
PGD is designed to allow replication to continue even while minor
differences exist between nodes. These features are designed to allow
application schema migration without downtime, or to allow logical
standby nodes for reporting or testing.

!!! Warning
    Rolling Application Schema Upgrades have to be managed outside of PGD.
    Careful scripting is required to make this work correctly
    on production clusters. Extensive testing is advised.

See [Replicating between nodes with differences](../appusage/) for details.

When one node runs DDL that adds a new table, nodes that have not
yet received the latest DDL need to handle the extra table.
In view of this, the appropriate setting for rolling schema upgrades
is to configure all nodes to apply the `skip` resolver in case of a
`target_table_missing` conflict. This must be performed before any
node has additional tables added and is intended to be a permanent
setting.

This is done with the following query, that must be **executed
separately on each node**, after replacing `node1` with the actual
node name:

```sql
SELECT bdr.alter_node_set_conflict_resolver('node1',
		'target_table_missing', 'skip');
```

When one node runs DDL that adds a column to a table, nodes that have not
yet received the latest DDL need to handle the extra columns.
In view of this, the appropriate setting for rolling schema
upgrades is to configure all nodes to apply the `ignore` resolver in
case of a `target_column_missing` conflict. This must be performed
before one node has additional columns added and is intended to be a
permanent setting.

This is done with the following query, that must be **executed
separately on each node**, after replacing `node1` with the actual
node name:

```sql
SELECT bdr.alter_node_set_conflict_resolver('node1',
		'target_column_missing', 'ignore');
```

When one node runs DDL that removes a column from a table, nodes that
have not yet received the latest DDL need to handle the missing column.
This situation will cause a `source_column_missing` conflict, which uses
the `use_default_value` resolver. Thus, columns that neither
accept NULLs nor have a DEFAULT value require a two step process:

1. Remove NOT NULL constraint or add a DEFAULT value for a column
   on all nodes.
2. Remove the column.

Constraints can be removed in a rolling manner.
There is currently no supported way for handling adding table
constraints in a rolling manner, one node at a time.

When one node runs a DDL that changes the type of an existing column,
depending on the existence of binary coercibility between the current
type and the target type, the operation may not rewrite the underlying
table data. In that case, it will be only a metadata update of the
underlying column type. Rewrite of a table is normally restricted.
However, in controlled DBA environments, it is possible to change
the type of a column to an automatically castable one by adopting
a rolling upgrade for the type of this column in a non-replicated
environment on all the nodes, one by one. See [ALTER TABLE](../ddl/#alter-table) for more details.
