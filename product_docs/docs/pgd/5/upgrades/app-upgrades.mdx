title: "Application schema upgrades"
---

Similar to the upgrade of EDB Postgres Distributed, there are two
approaches to upgrading the application schema. The simpler option is to
stop all applications affected, preform the schema upgrade, and restart the
application upgraded to use the new schema variant. This approach
imposes some downtime.

To eliminate this downtime, EDB Postgres Distributed offers useful tools to
perform a rolling application schema upgrade.

The following recommendations and tips reduce the impact of the
application schema upgrade on the cluster.

### Rolling application schema upgrades

By default, DDL will automatically be sent to all nodes. You can control this behavior
manually, as described in
[DDL Replication](../ddl/). You can use this approach
to create differences between database schemas across nodes.

PGD is designed to allow replication to continue even with minor
differences between nodes. These features are designed to allow
application schema migration without downtime or to allow logical
standby nodes for reporting or testing.

!!! Warning
    You must manage rolling application schema upgrades outside of PGD.

    Careful scripting is required to make this work correctly
    on production clusters. Extensive testing is advised.

See [Replicating between nodes with differences](../appusage/) for details.

When one node runs DDL that adds a new table, nodes that haven't
yet received the latest DDL need to handle the extra table.
In view of this, the appropriate setting for rolling schema upgrades
is to configure all nodes to apply the `skip` resolver in case of a
`target_table_missing` conflict. Perform this configuration before adding tables to any
node. This setting is intended to be permanent.

Execute the following query **separately on each node**. Replace `node1` with the actual
node name.

```sql
SELECT bdr.alter_node_set_conflict_resolver('node1',
		'target_table_missing', 'skip');
```

When one node runs DDL that adds a column to a table, nodes that haven't
yet received the latest DDL need to handle the extra columns.
In view of this, the appropriate setting for rolling schema
upgrades is to configure all nodes to apply the `ignore` resolver in
case of a `target_column_missing` conflict. Perform this before adding columns to
one node. This setting is intended to be
permanent.

Execute the following query **separately on each node**. Replace `node1` with the actual
node name.

```sql
SELECT bdr.alter_node_set_conflict_resolver('node1',
		'target_column_missing', 'ignore');
```

When one node runs DDL that removes a column from a table, nodes that
haven't yet received the latest DDL need to handle the missing column.
This situation causes a `source_column_missing` conflict, which uses
the `use_default_value` resolver. Thus, columns that don't
accept NULLs and don't have a DEFAULT value require a two-step process:

1. Remove the NOT NULL constraint, or add a DEFAULT value for a column
   on all nodes.
2. Remove the column.

You can remove constraints in a rolling manner.
There's currently no supported way for handling adding table
constraints in a rolling manner, one node at a time.

When one node runs a DDL that changes the type of an existing column,
depending on the existence of binary coercibility between the current
type and the target type, the operation might not rewrite the underlying
table data. In that case, it's only a metadata update of the
underlying column type. Rewriting a table is normally restricted.
However, in controlled DBA environments, you can change
the type of a column to an automatically castable one by adopting
a rolling upgrade for the type of this column in a non-replicated
environment on all the nodes, one by one. See [ALTER TABLE](../ddl/#alter-table) for more details.
