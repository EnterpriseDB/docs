## Performing a rolling Postgres major version upgrade

With your cluster set up and ready to be upgraded, you can now perform the rolling upgrade of the Postgres major version on your PGD cluster. Carry out the following steps on each node in the cluster:

- Confirm your current Postgres version.
- Stop Postgres on the target node.
- Install the new Postgres version and bdr_pg_upgrade.
- Initialize the new Postgres version.
- Copy the configuration for the old Postgres version to the configuration for the new Postgres version.
- Rename the PGDATA directories.
- Stop all Postgres instances.
- Check that you can upgrade safely.
- Run the Postgres major version upgrade.
- Modify the Postgres service.
- Start Postgres.
- Cleanup post-upgrade. 
- Validate the Postgres version. 

We will look at these steps for upgrading a node from Postgres 15 to Postgres 16 in detail below. 

## Worked example

A three-node cluster (bdr1, bdr2 and bdr3) are currently running Postgres 14 on a Linux OS. We want to upgrade a single node to Postgres 15 (and then upgrade our whole cluster). In this walkthrough the target node we will upgrade will be bdr3. We will be using `bdr_pg_upgrade` to do this.

!!! Note
This process will involve you running commands as the Postgres owner. We will refer to this user as `postgres` throughout. If you are running EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you will need to substitute that user with `enterprisedb` in all commands.
!!!

### Confirm your current Postgres version

Using psql, connect to any node that is still running Postgres 15 and run this query:

```
SELECT * FROM bdr.group_versions_details;
```

You should see output similar to this for your cluster:

```
  node_id   | node_name | postgres_version | bdr_version
------------+-----------+------------------+-------------
 1609217846 | bdr2      | 14.9             | 5.2.0
 1630662325 | bdr3      | 14.9             | 5.2.0
 4245713078 | bdr1      | 14.9             | 5.2.0
(3 rows)
```

Confirm that the Postgres version is the expected version.

### Stop Postgres on the target node

Use SSH to connect to the target node, in this case bdr3, and then run:

```
sudo systemctl stop postgres
```

This command halts the server on the current node. Your cluster will continue running using the other two nodes.

### Install the new Postgres version

On the target node, install the new version of Postgres and the upgrade tool by running:

```
sudo dnf -y install edb-bdr5-pg16 edb-bdr-utilities
```

### Initialize Postgres 16

On the target node, run:

```
sudo -u postgres /usr/pgsql-15/bin/initdb \
  -D /opt/postgres/datanew \
  -E UTF8 \
  --lc-collate=en_US.UTF-8 \
  --lc-ctype=en_US.UTF-8 
```

This command creates a PG16 directory for PG 16 configuration, `/opt/postgres/datanew`.

### Copy configuration for PG 15 to PG 16

The next step copies the existing configuration to the new PG16 directory.

On the target node, copy over the `postgresql.conf`, `postgresql.auto.conf`, `pg_hba.conf` files, and the whole conf.d directory:

```
sudo -u postgres cp /opt/postgres/data/postgresql.conf /opt/postgres/datanew/
sudo -u postgres cp /opt/postgres/data/postgresql.auto.conf /opt/postgres/datanew/
sudo -u postgres cp /opt/postgres/data/pg_hba.conf /opt/postgres/datanew/
sudo -u postgres cp -r /opt/postgres/data/conf.d/ /opt/postgres/datanew/
```

### Rename the PGDATA directories

While still on the target node, swap the PG15 and PG16 data directories around by
running: 

```
sudo -u postgres mv /opt/postgres/data /opt/postgres/dataold
sudo -u postgres mv /opt/postgres/datanew /opt/postgres/data
```

### Stop all Postgres instances

Although we stopped the Postgres service on the target node earlier, to be sure, run the stop command for both instances of Postgres (PG14 and PG15) on
the target node:

```
sudo /usr/pgsql-14/bin/pg_ctl -D /opt/postgres/dataold stop
sudo /usr/pgsql-15/bin/pg_ctl -D /opt/postgres/data stop
```

### Check that you can upgrade safely

The `bdr_pg_upgrade` tool has a `--check` option, which dry runs some of the
upgrade process. We can use this option to ensure the upgrade will go smoothly.

On the target node, run:

```
sudo -u postgres /usr/bin/bdr_pg_upgrade \
  --old-bindir /usr/pgsql-14/bin/ \
  --new-bindir /usr/pgsql-15/bin/ \
  --old-datadir /opt/postgres/dataold/ \
  --new-datadir /opt/postgres/data \
  --database bdrdb \
  --check
```

If all goes well, you should see this output:

### Run the Postgres major version upgrade

We are now ready to run the upgrade. On the target node, run:

```
sudo -u postgres /usr/bin/bdr_pg_upgrade \
  --old-bindir /usr/pgsql-14/bin/ \
  --new-bindir /usr/pgsql-15/bin/ \
  --old-datadir /opt/postgres/dataold/ \
  --new-datadir /opt/postgres/data \
  --database bdrdb
```

You should see the following output:

new cluster before continuing.

Your installation contains extensions that should be updated
with the ALTER EXTENSION command.  The file

when executed by psql by the database superuser will update
these extensions.


Upgrade Complete
----------------
Optimizer statistics are not transferred by pg_upgrade.
Once you start the new server, consider running:
    /usr/pgsql-15/bin/vacuumdb --all --analyze-in-stages

Running this script will delete the old cluster's data files:
    ./delete_old_cluster.sh

Stopping new cluster
```

### Modify the Postgres service

The Postgres service on the system is configured to start the old version 
of Postgres (PG14). We need to modify the `postgres.service` file to start the new 
version (PG15). This can be done using sed to replace the old version 
number "14" with "15" throughout the file. Once changed, we can tell the 
systemd daemon to reload the configuration. On the target node, run:

```
sudo sed -i -e  's/14/15/g' /etc/systemd/system/postgres.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

### Start Postgres

On the target node, start the modified Postgres service by running:

```
sudo systemctl start postgres
```

### Cleanup post-upgrade

We want to run a vacuum over to the database at this point as best practice. When the upgrade
ran, you may have noticed the post-upgrade report included:

```
Once you start the new server, consider running:
    /usr/pgsql-15/bin/vacuumdb --all --analyze-in-stages
```

Let's do this now. On the target node, run:

```
sudo -u postgres /usr/psql-15/bin/vacuumdb --all --analyze-in-stages
```

### Validate the Postgres version

Repeating step 1, with psql, connect to any node and run:

```
SELECT * FROM bdr.group_versions_details;
```

You should see an output similar to this for your cluster.

```
  node_id   | node_name | postgres_version | bdr_version
------------+-----------+------------------+-------------
 1609217846 | bdr2      | 14.9             | 5.2.0
 1630662325 | bdr3      | 15.4             | 5.2.0
 4245713078 | bdr1      | 14.9             | 5.2.0
(3 rows)
```

Confirm that the target node is running the upgraded Postgres.

## Next steps

To complete upgrading the cluster for this worked example, repeat the previous steps on the other nodes of the cluster, bdr1 and bdr2.
