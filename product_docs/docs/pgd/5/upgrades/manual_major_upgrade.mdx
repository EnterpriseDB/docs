## Performing a Postgres major version rolling upgrade

This document outlines the procedure for performing a major version upgrade of a Postgres cluster using Postgres Distributed (PGD). The rolling upgrade process allows updating individual cluster nodes to a new major Postgres version while maintaining cluster availability and operational continuity. This approach minimizes downtime and ensures data integrity by allowing the rest of the cluster to remain operational as each node is upgraded sequentially. Upgrading your Postgres cluster to a newer major version is recommended to access improved features, performance enhancements, and security updates. This guide provides step-by-step instructions to facilitate a smooth and controlled upgrade process.

!!! Note
Ensure that your databases and configuration files are backed up before starting the upgrade process to help prevent data loss.
!!!

To perform the rolling upgrade of the Postgres major version on your PGD cluster, carry out the following steps on each node in the cluster:

- Confirm the current Postgres version.
- Check to see if the target node is the write-leader of the cluster.
- If it is the write-leader, perform a planned switchover to make another node write-leader so you can upgrade the target node and ensure cluster availability.
- After confirming the target node is not the write-leader, stop Postgres.
- Install the new Postgres version and bdr_pg_upgrade.
- Initialize the new Postgres version.
- Copy the configuration for the old Postgres version to the configuration for the new Postgres version.
- Rename the PGDATA directories.
- Stop all Postgres instances.
- Check that you can upgrade safely.
- Run the Postgres major version upgrade.
- Modify the Postgres service.
- Start Postgres.
- Cleanup post-upgrade. 
- Validate the Postgres version. 

We will look at these steps in more detail below, specifically for upgrading a node from Postgres 15 to Postgres 16. 

## Worked example

A three-node cluster (kaftan, kaolin, and kaboom) we [deployed on AWS using TPA](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/quickstart/quick_start_aws/) is currently running Postgres 15 on a Linux OS (Debian in this case). We want to upgrade a single node to Postgres 16 using `bdr_pg_upgrade`, and then upgrade the rest of the cluster similarly. This walkthrough focuses on the detailed steps for the target node, kaboom. 

!!! Note
Some steps of this process will involve you running commands as the Postgres owner. We will refer to this user as `postgres` throughout when appropriate. If you are running EDB Postgres Advanced Server, you will need to substitute that user with `enterprisedb` in all relevant commands.
!!!

### Confirm the current Postgres version

Connect to any node that is still running Postgres 15 and use this command to connect to the PGD's `bdrdb` database:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql bdrdb
```
Then, when connected to bdrdb, use the following query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM bdr.group_versions_details;
```

You should see output similar to this for your cluster:

```
  node_id   | node_name |        postgres_version        | bdr_version 
------------+-----------+--------------------------------+-------------
 3490219809 | kaftan    | 15.5 (Debian 15.5-1EDB.buster) | 5.3.0
 2710197610 | kaboom    | 15.5 (Debian 15.5-1EDB.buster) | 5.3.0
 2111777360 | kaolin    | 15.5 (Debian 15.5-1EDB.buster) | 5.3.0
(3 rows)
```

Confirm that the Postgres version is the expected version. Then, use the `exit` command to return to the node's command prompt.

### Check to see if the target node is the write-leader of the cluster

To see if the target node is the write-leader, run the `pgd show-groups` command:

```bash
sudo -u postgres pgd show-groups
```

in our example, our target node kaboom, is the current write-leader:

```
Group        Group ID   Type   Parent Group Location Raft Routing Write Leader 
-----        --------   ----   ------------ -------- ---- ------- ------------ 
democluster  1935823863 global                       true false                
dc1_subgroup 1302278103 data   democluster  dc1      true true    kaboom   
```

### If the target node is the write-leader, perform a planned switchover

Therefore, to keep the cluster available throughout the upgrade (i.e. a *rolling upgrade*), we need to perform a planned switchover to make another node the write-leader while we upgrade the target node, kaboom. In this case, we switchover the write-leader from kaboom to kaftan:

```bash
sudo -u postgres pgd switchover --group-name dc1_subgroup --node-name kaftan
```

Go ahead and run `pgd show-groups` again to make sure kaftan is now the write leader:

```bash
sudo -u postgres pgd show-groups
```

Then you should see that kaftan is now the write-leader:

```
Group        Group ID   Type   Parent Group Location Raft Routing Write Leader 
-----        --------   ----   ------------ -------- ---- ------- ------------ 
democluster  1935823863 global                       true false                
dc1_subgroup 1302278103 data   democluster  dc1      true true    kaftan  
```

It is now safe to stop Postgres on kaboom.

### Stop Postgres on the target node

If you are not already on the target node, exit the node you are on and use SSH to connect to the target node, in this case, kaboom, and then run:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop postgres
```

This command halts the server on the current node, kaboom. Your cluster will continue running using the other two nodes.

### Install the new Postgres version

Now, while still on the target node, kaboom, install the new version of Postgres (PG16) and the upgrade tool by running:

```bash
sudo apt install edb-bdr5-pg16 edb-bdr-utilities
```

### Initialize Postgres 16

Make a new data directory for the upgraded Postgres and give the user, `postgres`, ownership of the directory:

```bash
sudo mkdir /opt/postgres/datanew
sudo chown -R postgres:postgres /opt/postgres/datanew
```

Then initialize Postgres 16 in the new directory:

```bash
sudo -u postgres /usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/initdb \
  -D /opt/postgres/datanew \
  -E UTF8 \
  --lc-collate=en_US.UTF-8 \
  --lc-ctype=en_US.UTF-8 \
  --data-checksums
```

This command creates a PG16 data directory for configuration, `/opt/postgres/datanew`.

### Copy configuration for Postgres 15 to Postgres 16

The next step copies the existing configuration (PG15) to the new PG16 data directory.

Copy over the `postgresql.conf`, `postgresql.auto.conf`, `pg_hba.conf` files, and the whole conf.d directory:

```bash
sudo -u postgres cp /opt/postgres/data/postgresql.conf /opt/postgres/datanew/
sudo -u postgres cp /opt/postgres/data/postgresql.auto.conf /opt/postgres/datanew/
sudo -u postgres cp /opt/postgres/data/pg_hba.conf /opt/postgres/datanew/
sudo -u postgres cp -r /opt/postgres/data/conf.d/ /opt/postgres/datanew/
```

### Rename the PGDATA directories

Now create another directory, `dataold`, and give the user, `postgres`, ownership over the directory:

```bash
sudo mkdir /opt/postgres/dataold
sudo chown -R postgres:postgres /opt/postgres/dataold
```

Next, configure the data directory, `opt/postgres`, so that the user, `postgres`, is now the owner and then grant them sufficient permissions to write to the directory:

```bash
sudo chown postgres:postgres /opt/postgres
sudo chmod u+wx /opt/postgres
```

Finally, swap the PG15 and PG16 data directories around by running: 

```bash
sudo -u postgres mv /opt/postgres/data /opt/postgres/dataold
sudo -u postgres mv /opt/postgres/datanew /opt/postgres/data
```

### Stop all Postgres instances

Although we stopped the Postgres service on the target node, kaboom, earlier, to be sure, run the stop command for both instances of Postgres (PG15 and PG16) on
the target node, kaboom:

```bash
sudo -u postgres /usr/lib/postgresql/15/bin/pg_ctl -D /opt/postgres/dataold stop
sudo -u postgres /usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/pg_ctl -D /opt/postgres/data stop
```

!!! Note
When running the first or second command to stop the old Postgres instance, you may receive the following error:

```bash
pg_ctl: directory "/opt/postgres/dataold" is not a database cluster directory
```

You may instead receive this error:

```bash
pg_ctl: PID file "/opt/postgres/data/postmaster.pid" does not exist
Is server running?
```
These errors are expected when both instances of Postgres are already shut down and, therefore, do not prevent the upgrade from progressing.
!!!

### Check that you can upgrade safely

The `bdr_pg_upgrade` tool has a `--check` option, which dry runs some of the upgrade process. We can use this option to ensure the upgrade will go smoothly. 


However, first, we need a directory for the files created by `bdr_pg_upgrade`, which we can give ownership of to the user `postgres`. 

Accordingly, create an `/upgrade` directory in the `/home` directory and then give ownership of that directory to the user `postgres`:

```bash
sudo mkdir /home/upgrade
sudo chown postgres:postgres /home/upgrade
```
Next, navigate to `/home/upgrade` and then run:

```bash
sudo -u postgres /usr/bin/bdr_pg_upgrade \
  --old-bindir /usr/lib/postgresql/15/bin/ \
  --new-bindir /usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/ \
  --old-datadir /opt/postgres/dataold/data \
  --new-datadir /opt/postgres/data \
  --database bdrdb \
  --check
```

If all goes well, you should see this output:

```

```

!!! Note
If you didn't initialize Postgres 16 with checksums using the `--data-checksums` option, you will receive an error letting you know about the incompatibility:

```bash
old cluster uses data checksums but the new one does not
```
!!!

### Run the Postgres major version upgrade

We are now ready to run the upgrade. On the target node, run:

```bash
sudo -u postgres /usr/bin/bdr_pg_upgrade \
  --old-bindir /usr/lib/postgresql/15/bin/ \
  --new-bindir /usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/ \
  --old-datadir /opt/postgres/dataold/data \
  --new-datadir /opt/postgres/data \
  --database bdrdb
```

You should see the following output:

these extensions.


Upgrade Complete
----------------
Optimizer statistics are not transferred by pg_upgrade.
Once you start the new server, consider running:
    /usr/pgsql-15/bin/vacuumdb --all --analyze-in-stages

Running this script will delete the old cluster's data files:
    ./delete_old_cluster.sh

Stopping new cluster
```

### Modify the Postgres service

The Postgres service on the system is configured to start the old version 
of Postgres (PG15). We need to modify the `postgres.service` file to start the new 
version (PG16). This can be done using `sed` to replace the old version 
number "15" with "16" throughout the file. Once changed, we can tell the 
systemd daemon to reload the configuration. On the target node, run:

```bash
sudo sed -i -e  's/15/16/g' /etc/systemd/system/postgres.service
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

### Start Postgres

Finally, start the modified Postgres service by running:

```bash
sudo systemctl start postgres
```

### Cleanup post-upgrade

We want to run a vacuum over to the database at this point as best practice. When the upgrade
ran, you may have noticed the post-upgrade report included:

```
Once you start the new server, consider running:
    /usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/vacuumdb --all --analyze-in-stages
```

Let's do this now. On the target node, run:

```bash
sudo -u postgres /usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/vacuumdb --all --analyze-in-stages
```

### Validate the Postgres version

Repeating our first step, check the version of Postgres to confirm that we upgraded kaboom correctly. While still on kaboom, run:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql bdrdb
```

```sql
SELECT * FROM bdr.group_versions_details;
```

You should see an output similar to this for your cluster.

```
  node_id   | node_name |        postgres_version        | bdr_version 
------------+-----------+--------------------------------+-------------
 3490219809 | kaftan    | 15.5 (Debian 15.5-1EDB.buster) | 5.3.0
 2710197610 | kaboom    | 16.1 (Debian 16.1-1EDB.buster) | 5.3.0
 2111777360 | kaolin    | 15.5 (Debian 15.5-1EDB.buster) | 5.3.0
(3 rows)
```

Confirm that kaboom is running the upgraded Postgres version. 

### Next steps

To complete upgrading the cluster for this worked example, repeat the previous steps on the other cluster nodes: kaftan and kaolin. After completing the upgrade on all nodes, while connected to one of the nodes, you can once again check your versions in the PGD database using:

```bash
sudo -u postgres psql bdrdb
```

Then run the SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM bdr.group_versions_details;
```
You should see output similar to the following:

```
  node_id   | node_name |        postgres_version        | bdr_version 
------------+-----------+--------------------------------+-------------
 3490219809 | kaftan    | 16.1 (Debian 16.1-1EDB.buster) | 5.3.0
 2710197610 | kaboom    | 16.1 (Debian 16.1-1EDB.buster) | 5.3.0
 2111777360 | kaolin    | 16.1 (Debian 16.1-1EDB.buster) | 5.3.0
(3 rows)
```
This shows that all the nodes have been successfully upgraded to the new Postgres version.

#### Reconcile with TPA

We used TPA to build our cluster in this worked example. So after all the nodes have been upgraded, we still need to [reconcile](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/tpa/latest/reference/reconciling-local-changes/) the upgraded version of Postgres with TPA to use TPA to manage the cluster in the future.

To do this, return to the server's command line where your TPA cluster directory resides. In this worked example, our TPA cluster directory is `/home/ubuntu/democluster` on the instance where we originally deployed the cluster using TPA.

After navigating to your cluster directory, use a code editor to edit `config.yml` and change `cluster vars:` from `postgres_version: '15'` to `postgres_version: '16'`.

Unless already added to your .bashrc or .bash_profile, ensure the TPA tools are accessible in your command line session by adding TPA's binary directory to your PATH.

```shell
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/EDB/TPA/bin
```
Then we can redeploy the cluster:

```shell
tpaexec deploy democluster
```

This final step should apply the configuration changes to the cluster managed by TPA. Upon successful deployment, reconciliation of the new version of Postgres with TPA and the upgrade procedure is complete.
