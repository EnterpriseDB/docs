title: "Upgrading"
---

Because EDB Postgres Distributed consists in multiple software components,
the upgrade strategy depends partially on which components are being upgraded.

In general it's possible to upgrade the cluster with almost zero downtime, by
using an approach called Rolling Upgrade where nodes are upgraded one by one, and
the application connections are switched over to already upgraded nodes.

Ii's also possible to stop all nodes, perform the upgrade on all nodes and
only then restart the entire cluster, just like with a standard PostgreSQL setup.
This strategy of upgrading all nodes at the same time avoids running with
mixed versions of software and therefore is the simplest, but obviously incurs
some downtime and is not recommended unless the Rolling Upgrade is not possible
for some reason.

To upgrade an EDB Postgres Distributed cluster, perform the following steps:

1. Plan the upgrade.
2. Prepare for the upgrade.
3. Upgrade the server software.
4. Check and validate the upgrade.

## Upgrade Planning

There are broadly two ways to upgrade each node.

* Upgrading nodes in-place to the newer software version, see [Rolling Server Software Upgrades](#rolling-server-software-upgrades).
* Replacing nodes with ones that have the newer version installed, see [Rolling Upgrade Using Node Join](#rolling-upgrade-using-node-join).

Both of these approaches can be done in a rolling manner.

### Rolling Upgrade considerations

While the cluster is going through a rolling upgrade, mixed versions of software
are running in the cluster. For example, nodeA has BDR 3.7.16, while
nodeB and nodeC has 4.1.0. In this state, the replication and group
management uses the protocol and features from the oldest version (3.7.16
in case of this example), so any new features provided by the newer version
which require changes in the protocol are disabled. Once all nodes are
upgraded to the same version, the new features are automatically enabled.

Similarly, when a cluster with WAL decoder enabled nodes is going through a
rolling upgrade, WAL decoder on a higher version of BDR node produces LCRs
with a higher pglogical version and WAL decoder on a lower version of BDR node
produces LCRs with lower pglogical version. As a result, WAL senders on a higher
version of BDR nodes are not expected to use LCRs due to a mismatch in protocol
versions while on a lower version of BDR nodes, WAL senders may continue to use
LCRs. Once all the BDR nodes are on the same BDR version, WAL senders use
LCRs.

A rolling upgrade starts with a cluster with all nodes at a prior release,
then proceeds by upgrading one node at a time to the newer release, until
all nodes are at the newer release. There should never be more than two versions
of any component running at the same time, which means the new upgrade must not
be initiated until the previous upgrade process has fully finished on all nodes.

An upgrade process may take an extended period of time when the user decides
caution is required to reduce business risk, though it's not recommended
to run the mixed versions of the software indefinitely.

While Rolling Upgrade can be used for upgrading major version of the software
it is not supported to mix PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Extended and
EDB Postgres Advanced Server in one cluster, so this approach cannot
be used to change the Postgres variant.

!!! Warning
    Downgrades of the EDB Postgres Distributed are *not* supported and require
    manual rebuild of the cluster.

### Rolling Server Software Upgrades

A rolling upgrade is the process where the [Server
Software Upgrade](#server-software-upgrade) process is performed on each node in the
cluster one after another, while keeping the remainder of the cluster
operational.

The actual procedure depends on whether the Postgres component is being
upgraded to a new major version or not.

During the upgrade process, the application can be switched over to a node
which is currently not being upgraded to provide continuous availability of
the database for applications.

### Rolling Upgrade Using Node Join

The other method of upgrade of the server software, is to join a new node
to the cluster and later drop one of the existing nodes running
the older version of the software.

For this approach, the procedure is always the same, however because it
includes node join, the potentially large data transfer is required.

Care must be taken to not use features that are available only in
the newer Postgres versions, until all nodes are upgraded to the
newer and same release of Postgres. This is especially true for any
new DDL syntax that may have been added to a newer release of Postgres.

!!! Note
    `bdr_init_physical` makes a byte-by-byte of the source node
    so it cannot be used while upgrading from one major Postgres version
    to another. In fact, currently `bdr_init_physical` requires that even the
    BDR version of the source and the joining node is exactly the same.
    It cannot be used for rolling upgrades via joining a new node method. Instead, a logical join must be used.

### Upgrading a CAMO-Enabled Cluster

Upgrading CAMO-Enabled Cluster requires upgrading CAMO groups one by one, while
disabling the CAMO protection for the group being upgraded and reconfiguring it
using the new [Commit Scope](/pgd/latest/durability/commit-scopes) based settings.

## Upgrade Preparation

Each major release of the software contains several changes that may affect
compatibility with previous releases. These may affect the Postgres
configuration, deployment scripts, as well as applications using BDR. We
recommend to consider and possibly adjust in advance of the upgrade.

Please see individual changes mentioned in [release notes](/pgd/latest/rel_notes/) and any version
specific upgrade notes in this topic.

## Server Software Upgrade

The upgrade of EDB Postgres Distributed on individual nodes happens in-place.
There is no need for backup and restore when upgrading the BDR extension.

### BDR Extension Upgrade

BDR extension upgrade process consists of few simple steps.

#### Stop Postgres

During the upgrade of binary packages, it's usually best to stop the running
Postgres server first to ensure that mixed versions don't get loaded in case
of unexpected restart during the upgrade.

#### Upgrade Packages

The first step in the upgrade is to install the new version of the BDR packages, which
installs both the new binary and the extension SQL script. This step is operating system-specific.

#### Start Postgres

Once packages are upgraded the Postgres instance can be started, the BDR
extension is automatically upgraded upon start when the new binaries
detect older version of the extension.

### Postgres Upgrade

The process of in-place upgrade of Postgres highly depends on whether you are
upgrading to new minor version of Postgres of to new major version of Postgres.

#### Minor Version Postgres Upgrade

Upgrading to a new minor version of Postgres is similar to [upgrading
the BDR extension](#bdr-extension-upgrade). Stopping Postgres, upgrading packages,
and starting Postgres again is typically all that's needed.

However, sometimes additional steps like re-indexing may be recommended for
specific minor version upgrades. Refer to the Release Notes of the
specific version of Postgres you are upgrading to.

#### Major Version Postgres Upgrade

Upgrading to a new major version of Postgres is a more complicated process.

EDB Postgres Distributed provides a `bdr_pg_upgrade` command line utility,
which can be used to do a [In-place Postgres Major Version Upgrades](bdr_pg_upgrade).

!!! Note
    When upgrading to new major version of any software, including Postgres, the
    BDR extension and others, it's always important to ensure the compatibility
    of your application with the target version of a given software.

## Upgrade Check and Validation

After this procedure, your BDR node is upgraded. You can verify the current
version of BDR4 binary like this:

```sql
SELECT bdr.bdr_version();
```

Always check the [monitoring](../monitoring) after upgrade of a node to confirm
that the upgraded node is working as expected.

## Moving from HARP to PGD-Proxy

HARP can for a time coexist with the new
[Connection management](/product_docs/docs/pgd/5/routing) configuration.

This means you can upgrade whole pre-5 cluster to PGD 5 cluster, setup
the connection routing, replace the HARP Proxy with PGD-Proxy, move application
connections to PGD-Proxy instances and removed the HARP Manager from all servers.

It's highly recommended to do this as soon as possible after upgrading nodes to
PGD 5 as HARP is not certified for long term use with PGD 5.

TPA provides some useful tools for this and will eventually provide single
command upgrade path between PGD 4 and PGD 5.
