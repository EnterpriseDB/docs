While PGD and Postgres are closely related, they're separate products with separate upgrade paths. This section covers how to upgrade both PGD and Postgres.

## Upgrading PGD

EDB Postgres Distributed is a flexible platform. This means that your upgrade path depends largely on how you installed PGD.

* **[Upgrading manually](manual_overview)** &mdash; If you manually installed and configured your PGD cluster, you can move a cluster between versions, both minor and major.

* **[Upgrade paths](upgrade_paths)** &mdash; Several supported upgrade paths are available.

* **[Compatibility changes](compatibility)** &mdash; If you're upgrading from PGD 3.x or 4.x to PGD 5.x or later, you need to understand the compatibility changes between versions.
