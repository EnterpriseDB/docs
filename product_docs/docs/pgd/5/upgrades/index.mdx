title: "Upgrading"
---

Because EDB Postgres Distributed consists of multiple software components,
the upgrade strategy depends partially on the components that are being upgraded.

In general, you can upgrade the cluster with almost zero downtime by
using an approach called rolling upgrade. Using this approach, nodes are upgraded one by one, and
the application connections are switched over to already upgraded nodes.

You can also stop all nodes, perform the upgrade on all nodes, and
only then restart the entire cluster. This approach is the same as with a standard PostgreSQL setup.
This strategy of upgrading all nodes at the same time avoids running with
mixed versions of software and therefore is the simplest. However, it incurs
some downtime and we don't recommend it  unless you can't perform the rolling upgrade
for some reason.

To upgrade an EDB Postgres Distributed cluster:

1. Plan the upgrade.
2. Prepare for the upgrade.
3. Upgrade the server software.
4. Check and validate the upgrade.

## Upgrade planning

There are broadly two ways to upgrade each node:

* Upgrade nodes in place to the newer software version. See [Rolling server software upgrades](#rolling-server-software-upgrades).
* Replace nodes with ones that have the newer version installed. See [Rolling upgrade using node join](#rolling-upgrade-using-node-join).

You can use both of these approaches in a rolling manner.

### Rolling upgrade considerations

While the cluster is going through a rolling upgrade, mixed versions of software
are running in the cluster. For example, suppose nodeA has BDR 3.7.16, while
nodeB and nodeC has 4.1.0. In this state, the replication and group
management uses the protocol and features from the oldest version (3.7.16
in this example), so any new features provided by the newer version
that require changes in the protocol are disabled. Once all nodes are
upgraded to the same version, the new features are enabled.

Similarly, when a cluster with WAL-decoder-enabled nodes is going through a
rolling upgrade, WAL decoder on a higher version of BDR node produces LCRs
with a higher pglogical version. WAL decoder on a lower version of a BDR node
produces LCRs with a lower pglogical version. As a result, WAL senders on a higher
version of BDR nodes aren't expected to use LCRs due to a mismatch in protocol
versions. On a lower version of BDR nodes, WAL senders can continue to use
LCRs. Once all the BDR nodes are on the same BDR version, WAL senders use
LCRs.

A rolling upgrade starts with a cluster with all nodes at a prior release.
It then proceeds by upgrading one node at a time to the newer release, until
all nodes are at the newer release. More than two versions
of any component must never be running at the same time. This requirement means that you must not start the new upgrade until the previous upgrade process fully finishes on all nodes.

An upgrade process can take more time when 
caution is required to reduce business risk. However, we don't recommend
running the mixed versions of the software indefinitely.

While you can use a rolling upgrade for upgrading a major version of the software,
we don't support mixing PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Extended, and
EDB Postgres Advanced Server in one cluster. So you can't use this approach 
to change the Postgres variant.

!!! Warning
    Downgrades of the EDB Postgres Distributed aren't supported. They require
    that you manually rebuild the cluster.

### Rolling server software upgrades

A rolling upgrade is the process where the [server
software upgrade](#server-software-upgrade) process is performed on each node in the
cluster one after another while keeping the rest of the cluster
operating.

The actual procedure depends on whether the Postgres component is being
upgraded to a new major version.

During the upgrade process, you can switch the application over to a node
that's currently not being upgraded to provide continuous availability of
the database for applications.

### Rolling upgrade using node join

The other method to upgrade the server software is to join a new node
to the cluster and later drop one of the existing nodes running
the older version of the software.

For this approach, the procedure is always the same. However, because it
includes node join, a potentially large data transfer is required.

Take care not to use features that are available only in
the newer Postgres versions until all nodes are upgraded to the
newer and same release of Postgres. This is especially true for any
new DDL syntax that was added to a newer release of Postgres.

!!! Note
    `bdr_init_physical` makes a byte-by-byte of the source node
    so you can't use it while upgrading from one major Postgres version
    to another. In fact, currently `bdr_init_physical` requires that even the
    BDR version of the source and the joining node be exactly the same.
    You can't use it for rolling upgrades by way of joining a new node method. Instead, use a logical join.

<!--Is this meant to say "byte-by-byte copy"? It looks like there's a missing word. -->

### Upgrading a CAMO-enabled cluster

Upgrading a CAMO-enabled cluster requires upgrading CAMO groups one by one while
disabling the CAMO protection for the group being upgraded and reconfiguring it
using the new [commit scope](../durability/commit-scopes)-based settings.

## Upgrade preparation

Each major release of the software contains several changes that might affect
compatibility with previous releases. These might affect the Postgres
configuration, deployment scripts, as well as applications using BDR. We
recommend considering these changes and making any needed adjustments in advance of the upgrade.

See individual changes mentioned in the [release notes](../rel_notes/) and any version-specific upgrade notes.

## Server software upgrade

Upgrading EDB Postgres Distributed on individual nodes happens in place.
You don't need to back up and restore when upgrading the BDR extension.

### BDR extension upgrade

The BDR extension upgrade process consists of a few steps.

#### Stop Postgres

During the upgrade of binary packages, it's usually best to stop the running
Postgres server first. Doing so ensures that mixed versions don't get loaded in case
of an unexpected restart during the upgrade.

#### Upgrade packages

The first step in the upgrade is to install the new version of the BDR packages. This installation
installs both the new binary and the extension SQL script. This step is specific to the operating system.

#### Start Postgres

Once packages are upgraded, you can start the Postgres instance. The BDR
extension is upgraded upon start when the new binaries
detect the older version of the extension.

### Postgres upgrade

The process of in-place upgrade of Postgres depends on whether you're
upgrading to new minor version of Postgres or to a new major version of Postgres.

#### Minor version Postgres upgrade

Upgrading to a new minor version of Postgres is similar to [upgrading
the BDR extension](#bdr-extension-upgrade). Stopping Postgres, upgrading packages,
and starting Postgres again is typically all that's needed.

However, sometimes more steps, like reindexing, might be recommended for
specific minor version upgrades. Refer to the release notes of the 
version of Postgres you're upgrading to.

#### Major version Postgres upgrade

Upgrading to a new major version of Postgres is more complicated than upgrading to a minor version.

EDB Postgres Distributed provides a `bdr_pg_upgrade` command line utility,
which you can use to do [in-place Postgres major version upgrades](bdr_pg_upgrade).

!!! Note
    When upgrading to a new major version of any software, including Postgres, the
    BDR extension, and others, it's always important to ensure the compatibility
    of your application with the target version of the software you're upgrading.

## Upgrade check and validation

After you upgrade your BDR node, you can verify the current
version of the BDR4 binary like this:

```sql
SELECT bdr.bdr_version();
```

Always check the [monitoring](../monitoring) after upgrading a node to confirm
that the upgraded node is working as expected.

## Moving from HARP to PGD Proxy

HARP can for a time coexist with the new
[connection management](../routing) configuration. This means you can:

-  Upgrade a whole pre-5 cluster to a PGD 5 cluster. 
-  Set up the connection routing. 
-  Replace the HARP Proxy with PGD Proxy. 
-  Move application connections to PGD Proxy instances.
-  Remove the HARP Manager from all servers.

We strongly recommend doing this as soon as possible after upgrading nodes to
PGD 5. HARP isn't certified for long-term use with PGD 5.

TPA provides some useful tools for this and will eventually provide a single-command 
upgrade path between PGD 4 and PGD 5.
