## Upgrading Postgres major versions

Upgrading a Postgres database's major version to access improved features, performance enhancements, and security updates is a common administration task. Doing the same for a Postgres Distributed (PGD) cluster deployed with Trusted Postgres Architect (TPA) is essentially the same process but performed as a rolling upgrade.

The rolling upgrade process allows updating individual cluster nodes to a new major Postgres version while maintaining cluster availability and operational continuity. This approach minimizes downtime and ensures data integrity by allowing the rest of the cluster to remain operational as each node is upgraded sequentially. 

The following overview of the general instructions and [worked example](#worked-example) help to provide a smooth and controlled upgrade process.

### Prepare the upgrade

To prepare for the upgrade, identify the subgroups and nodes you're trying to upgrade and note an initial upgrade order.

To do this, connect to one of the nodes using SSH and run the `pgd show-nodes` command:

```bash
sudo -u postgres pgd show-nodes
```

The `pgd show-nodes` command shows you all the nodes in your PGD cluster and the subgroup to which each node belongs. Then you want to find out which node is the write leader in each subgroup by running:

```bash
sudo -u postgres pgd show-groups
```

This command outputs a list of the different groups/subgroups running in your cluster and the write leader of each group. To maintain operational continuity, you need to switch write leaders over to another node in their subgroup before you can upgrade them. To keep the number of planned switchovers to a minimum, when upgrading a subgroup of nodes, upgrade the writer leaders last. 

Even though you verified which node is the current write leader for planning purposes, the write leader of a subgroup could change to another node at any moment for operational reasons before you upgrade that node. Therefore, you still need to verify that a node isn't the write leader just before upgrading that node.

You now have enough information to determine your upgrade order, one subgroup at a time, aiming to upgrade the identified write leader node last in each subgroup. 

### Perform the upgrade on each node

!!! Note
To help prevent data loss, ensure that your databases and configuration files are backed up before starting the upgrade process.
!!!

Using the [preliminary order](#prepare-the-upgrade), perform the following steps on each node while connected via SSH:

* **Confirm the current Postgres version**
  * View versions from PGD by running `sudo -u postgres pgd show-version`.
  * Ensure that the expected major version is running.


* **Verify that the target node isn't the write leader**
  * Check whether the target node is the write leader for the group you're upgrading using `sudo -u postgres pgd show-groups`.
  * If the target node is the current write leader for the group/subgroup you're upgrading, perform a [planned switchover](#perform-a-planned-switchover) to another node.
    * `sudo -u postgres pgd switchover --group-name <group_name> --node-name <new_write_leader_node_name>`


* **Stop Postgres on the target node**
  * Stop the Postgres service on the current node by running `sudo systemctl stop postgres`.
  * The target node is no longer actively participating as a node in the cluster.


* **Install PGD and utilities**
  * Install PGD and its utilities compatible with the Postgres version you're upgrading to.
    * `sudo apt install edb-bdr<new_pgd_version_number>-pg<new_postgres_version_number> edb-bdr-utilities`


* **Initialize the new Postgres instance**
  * Create a directory that will house the database files for the new version of PostgreSQL: 
    * `sudo mkdir -p /opt/postgres/datanew`
    * Ensure that user postgres has ownership permissions (chown) to the directory.
  * Initialize a new PostgreSQL database cluster in the directory you just created. 
    * This step involves using the `initdb` command provided by the newly installed version of PostgreSQL. 
    * Replace `<path_to_postgres_bin>` with the path to the bin directory of the newly installed PostgreSQL version: `sudo -u postgres <path_to_postgres_bin>/initdb -D /opt/postgres/datanew`.
    * You may need to run this command as the postgres user or another user with appropriate permissions.
    * Make sure to include the `--data-checksums` flag to ensure the cluster uses data checksums.


* **Migrate configuration to the new Postgres version**
  * Locate the following configuration files in your current PostgreSQL data directory:
    * `postgresql.conf`
      * The main configuration file containing settings related to the database system.
    * `postgresql.auto.conf`
      * Contains settings set by PostgreSQL, such as those modified by the `ALTER SYSTEM` command.
    * `pg_hba.conf`
      * Manages client authentication, specifying which users can connect to which databases from which hosts.
    * The entire `conf.d` directory (if present)
      * Allows for organizing configuration settings into separate files for better manageability.
  * Copy these files and the `conf.d` directory to the new data directory you created for the upgraded version of PostgreSQL.


* **Verify the Postgres service is inactive**
  * Before proceeding, it's important to ensure that no PostgreSQL processes are active for both the old and the new data directories. This verification step prevents any data corruption or conflicts during the upgrade process.
  * Use the `sudo systemctl status postgres` command to verify that Postgres was stopped.
  * If it isn't stopped, run `systemctl stop postgres` and verify again that it was stopped.


* **Swap PGDATA directories for version upgrade**
  * Rename `/opt/postgres/data` to `/opt/postgres/dataold` and `/opt/postgres/datanew` to `/opt/postgres/data`. 
  * This step readies your system for the next crucial phase: running pg_upgrade to finalize the PostgreSQL version transition.


* **Verify upgrade feasibility**
  * The `bdr_pg_upgrade` tool offers a `--check` option designed to perform a preliminary scan of your current setup, identifying any potential issues that could hinder the upgrade process.
  * You need to run this check from an upgrade directory with ownership given to user `postgres`, such as `/home/upgrade/`, so that the upgrade log files created by `bdr_pg_upgrade` can be stored.
  * To initiate the safety check, append the `--check` option to your `bdr_pg_upgrade` command.
  * This operation simulates the upgrade process without making any changes, providing insights into any compatibility issues, deprecated features, or configuration adjustments required for a successful upgrade. 
  * Address any warnings or errors indicated by this check to ensure an uneventful transition to the new version.


* **Execute the Postgres major version upgrade**
  * Execute the upgrade process by running the `bdr_pg_upgrade` command without the `--check` option.
  * It's essential to monitor the command output for any errors or warnings that require attention. 
  * The time the upgrade process take depends on the size of your database and the complexity of your setup.


* **Update the Postgres service configuration**
  * Update the service configuration to reflect the new PostgreSQL version by updating the version number in the `postgres.service` file:
    * `sudo sed -i -e 's/<old_version_number>/<new_version_number>/g' /etc/systemd/system/postgres.service`
  * Refresh the system's service manager to apply these changes:
    * `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`


* **Restart Postgres**
  * Proceed to restart the PostgreSQL service.
    * `systemctl start postgres`


* **Validate the new Postgres version**
  * Verify that your PostgreSQL instance is now upgraded by again running `sudo -u postgres pgd show-version`.


* **Clean up post-upgrade**
  * Run `vacuumdb` with the `ANALYZE` option immediately after the upgrade but before introducing a heavy production load. 
    * Running this command minimizes the immediate performance impact, preparing the database for more accurate testing.
  * Remove the old version's data directory, `/opt/postgres/dataold`.
 
### Reconcile the upgrade with TPA

TPA needs to continue to manage the deployment effectively after all the nodes have been upgraded. Therefore, it's necessary to reconcile the upgraded nodes with TPA. 

Follow these steps to update the configuration and redeploy the PGD cluster through TPA.

* **Update the `config.yml`**
  * Change the `config.yml` of the TPA-managed cluster to the new version.
    * `cluster_vars: postgres_version: '<new_version_number>'`


* **Use `tpaexec` to redeploy the PGD cluster with the updated `config.yml`**
  * `tpaexec deploy <cluster_name>`

The worked example that follows shows upgrading the Postgres major version from 15 to 16 on a PGD 5 cluster deployed with TPA in detail.

## Worked example

This worked example starts with a TPA-managed PGD cluster deployed using the [AWS Quickstart](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/quickstart/quick_start_aws/). The cluster has three nodes: kaboom, kaolin, and kaftan, all running Postges 15.

This example starts with kaboom.

!!! Note
Some steps of this process involve running commands as the Postgres owner. We refer to this user as postgres throughout, when appropriate. If you're running EDB Postgres Advanced Server, substitute the postgres user with enterprisedb in all relevant commands.
!!!

### Confirm the current Postgres version

SSH into kaboom to confirm the major version of Postgres is expected by running:

```bash
sudo -u postgres pgd show-version
```

The output will be similar to this for your cluster:

```
Node   BDR Version Postgres Version               
----   ----------- ----------------               
kaboom 5.4.0       15.6 (Debian 15.6-2EDB.buster) 
kaftan 5.4.0       15.6 (Debian 15.6-2EDB.buster) 
kaolin 5.4.0       15.6 (Debian 15.6-2EDB.buster) 

```

Confirm that the Postgres version is the expected version.

### Verify that the target node isn't the write leader

The cluster must be available throughout the process (that is, a *rolling* upgrade). There must always be an available write leader to maintain continuous cluster availability. So, if the target node is the current write leader, you must [perform a planned switchover](#perform-a-planned-switchover) of the [write leader](../terminology/#write-leader) node before upgrading it so that a write leader is always available. 

While connected via SSH to kaboom, see which node is the current write leader of the group you're upgrading using the `pgd show-groups` command:

```bash
sudo -u postgres pgd show-groups
```

In this case, you can see that kaboom is the current write leader of the sole subgroup `dc1_subgroup`:

```
Group        Group ID   Type   Parent Group Location Raft Routing Write Leader 
-----        --------   ----   ------------ -------- ---- ------- ------------ 
democluster  1935823863 global                       true false                
dc1_subgroup 1302278103 data   democluster  dc1      true true    kaboom  
```

So you must perform a planned switchover of the write leader of `dc1_subgroup` to another node in the cluster.

#### Perform a planned switchover

Change the write leader to kaftan so kaboom's Postgres instance can be stopped:

```bash
sudo -u postgres pgd switchover --group-name dc1_subgroup --node-name kaftan
```

After the switchover is successful, it's safe to stop Postgres on the target node. Of course, if kaftan is still the write leader when you come to upgrading it, you'll need to perform another planned switchover at that time.

### Stop Postgres on the target node

While connected via SSH to the target node (in this case, kaboom), stop Postgres on the node by running:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop postgres
```

This command halts the server on kaboom. Your cluster continues running using the other two nodes.

### Install PGD and utilities

Next, install the new version of Postgres (PG16) and the upgrade tool:

```bash
sudo apt install edb-bdr5-pg16 edb-bdr-utilities
```

### Initialize the new Postgres instance

Make a new data directory for the upgraded Postgres, and give the postgres user ownership of the directory:

```bash
sudo mkdir /opt/postgres/datanew
sudo chown -R postgres:postgres /opt/postgres/datanew
```

Then, initialize Postgres 16 in the new directory:

```bash
sudo -u postgres /usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/initdb \
  -D /opt/postgres/datanew \
  -E UTF8 \
  --lc-collate=en_US.UTF-8 \
  --lc-ctype=en_US.UTF-8 \
  --data-checksums
```

This command creates a PG16 data directory for configuration, `/opt/postgres/datanew`.

### Migrate configuration to the new Postgres version

The next step copies the configuration files from the old Postgres version (PG15) to the new Postgres version's (PG16). Configuration files reside in each version's data directory.

Copy over the `postgresql.conf`, `postgresql.auto.conf`, and `pg_hba.conf` files and the whole `conf.d` directory:

```bash
sudo -u postgres cp /opt/postgres/data/postgresql.conf /opt/postgres/datanew/
sudo -u postgres cp /opt/postgres/data/postgresql.auto.conf /opt/postgres/datanew/
sudo -u postgres cp /opt/postgres/data/pg_hba.conf /opt/postgres/datanew/
sudo -u postgres cp -r /opt/postgres/data/conf.d/ /opt/postgres/datanew/
```

### Verify the Postgres service is inactive

Although you [previously stopped the Postgres service on the target node](#stop-postgres-on-the-target-node), kaboom, to verify it's stopped, run the `systemctl status postgres` command:

```bash
sudo systemctl status postgres
```

The output of the `status` command shows that the Postgres service has stopped running:

```

```

### Swap PGDATA directories for version upgrade

Next, swap the PG15 and PG16 data directories: 

```bash
sudo mv /opt/postgres/data /opt/postgres/dataold
sudo mv /opt/postgres/datanew /opt/postgres/data
```

!!! Important
If something goes wrong at some point during the procedure, you may want to rollback/revert a node to the older major version. To do this, rename directories again so that the current data directory, `/opt/postgres/data`, becomes `/opt/postgres/datafailed` and the old data directory, `/opt/postgres/dataold`, becomes the current data directory:

```bash
sudo mv /opt/postgres/data /opt/postgres/datafailed
sudo mv /opt/postgres/dataold /opt/postgres/data
```

This rolls back/reverts the node back to the previous major version of Postgres.
!!!

### Verify upgrade feasibility

The `bdr_pg_upgrade` tool has a `--check` option, which performs a dry run of some of the upgrade process. You can use this option to ensure the upgrade goes smoothly.

However, first, you need a directory for the files created by `bdr_pg_upgrade`. For this example, create an `/upgrade` directory in the `/home` directory. Then give ownership of the directory to the user postgres. 

```bash
sudo mkdir /home/upgrade
sudo chown postgres:postgres /home/upgrade
```

Next, navigate to `/home/upgrade` and run:

```bash
sudo -u postgres /usr/bin/bdr_pg_upgrade \
  --old-bindir /usr/lib/postgresql/15/bin/ \
  --new-bindir /usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/ \
  --old-datadir /opt/postgres/dataold/ \
  --new-datadir /opt/postgres/data/ \
  --database bdrdb \
  --check
```

The following is the output:

```

```

!!! Note
If you didn't initialize Postgres 16 with checksums using the `--data-checksums` option, but did initialize checksums with your Postgres 15 instance, an error tells you about the incompatibility:

```bash
old cluster uses data checksums but the new one does not
```
!!!

### Execute the Postgres major version upgrade

You're ready to run the upgrade. On the target node, run:

```bash
sudo -u postgres /usr/bin/bdr_pg_upgrade \
  --old-bindir /usr/lib/postgresql/15/bin/ \
  --new-bindir /usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/ \

### Update the Postgres service configuration

The Postgres service on the system is configured to start the old version of Postgres (PG15). You need to modify the `postgres.service` file to start the new version (PG16). 

You can do this using `sed` to replace the old version number `15` with `16` throughout the file. 

```bash
sudo sed -i -e  's/15/16/g' /etc/systemd/system/postgres.service
```

After you've changed the version number, you can tell the systemd daemon to reload the configuration. On the target node, run:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

### Restart Postgres

Start the modified Postgres service by running:

```bash
sudo systemctl start postgres
``` 

### Validate the new Postgres version

Repeating the first step, check the version of Postgres to confirm that you upgraded kaboom correctly. While still on kaboom, run:

```bash
sudo -u postgres pgd show-version
```

Use the output to confirm that kaboom is running the upgraded Postgres version:

 ```
Node   BDR Version Postgres Version               
----   ----------- ----------------               
kaboom 5.4.0       16.2 (Debian 16.2-2EDB.buster) 
kaftan 5.4.0       15.6 (Debian 15.6-2EDB.buster) 
kaolin 5.4.0       15.6 (Debian 15.6-2EDB.buster) 

```

Here kaboom has been upgraded to major version 16.

### Clean up post-upgrade

As a best practice, run a vacuum over the database at this point. When the upgrade ran, you may have noticed the post-upgrade report included:

```
Once you start the new server, consider running:
    /usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/vacuumdb --all --analyze-in-stages
```

You can run the vacuum now. On the target node, run:

```bash
sudo -u postgres /usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin/vacuumdb --all --analyze-in-stages
```

If you're sure you don't need to revert this node, you can also clean up the old data directory folder `dataold`:

```bash
sudo rm -r /opt/postgres/dataold
```

Upgrading the target node is now complete.

### Next steps

After completing the upgrade on kaboom, run the same steps on kaolin and kaftan.

If you followed along with this example and kaftan is the write leader, to ensure availability, you must [perform a planned switchover](#perform-a-planned-switchover) to another, already upgraded node before running the upgrade steps on kaftan.

#### Check Postgres versions across the cluster 

After completing the upgrade on all nodes, while connected to one of the nodes, you can once again check your versions:

```bash
sudo -u postgres pgd show-version
```

The output will be similar to the following:

 ```
Node   BDR Version Postgres Version               
----   ----------- ----------------               
kaboom 5.4.0       16.2 (Debian 16.2-2EDB.buster) 
kaftan 5.4.0       16.2 (Debian 16.2-2EDB.buster) 
kaolin 5.4.0       16.2 (Debian 16.2-2EDB.buster) 

```

This output shows that all the nodes are successfully upgraded to the new Postgres version 16.

#### Reconcile with TPA

After all the nodes are upgraded, you still need to [reconcile](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/tpa/latest/reference/reconciling-local-changes/) the upgraded version of Postgres with TPA so you can continue to use TPA to manage the cluster in the future.

To do this, return to the command line where your TPA cluster directory resides. In this worked example, the TPA cluster directory is `/home/ubuntu/democluster` on the instance where you originally deployed the cluster using TPA.

After navigating to your cluster directory, use a code editor to edit `config.yml` and change `cluster_vars:` from `postgres_version: '15'` to `postgres_version: '16'`.

Unless they were already added to your `.bashrc` or `.bash_profile`, ensure the TPA tools are accessible in your command line session by adding TPA's binary directory to your PATH:

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/EDB/TPA/bin
```
Finally, redeploy the cluster:

```bash
tpaexec deploy democluster
```

This command applies the configuration changes to the cluster managed by TPA. If the deployment is successful, the reconciliation of the new version of Postgres with TPA and the upgrade procedure as a whole is complete.
