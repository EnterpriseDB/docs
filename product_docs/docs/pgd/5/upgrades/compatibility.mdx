title: Compatibility changes
---

There are numerous changes in PGD 5 that are not backwards compatible with
PGD 4 or PGD 3.7.

## Connection routing

HARP Manager does not exist anymore, it's been replaced by new
[Connection management](/pgd/latest/routing) configuration.

HARP Proxy is replaced by similarly functioning PGD-Proxy which removes any
deprecated features and is configured through above mentioned connection
management configuration.

## Commit At Most Once

CAMO configuration is now done through [Commit Scopes](commit-scopes). The
`bdr.camo_pairs` catalog and any related manipulation functions don't exist
anymore. The `bdr.enable_camo` GUC was removed.
The `synchronous_replication_availability` GUC does not affect CAMO anymore.
Use the `DEGRADE ON ... TO ASYNC` clause of a commit scope.


## Eager All Node Replication

There is no more `global` scope, however it's possible to create scope with same
behavior using [Group Commit](group-commit).

```sql
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'eager_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'top_group',
    rule := 'ALL (top_group) GROUP COMMIT (conflict_resolution = eager, commit_decision = raft) ABORT ON (timeout = 60s)'
);
```

The `bdr.global_commit_timeout` GUC was removed, use `ABORT ON` clause for the
commit scope.

## Lag Control

Similarly to CAMO and Eager, Lag Control configuration was also moved to
[Commit Scopes](commit-scopes) for more flexible durability configuration.

## Catalogs

- `bdr.workers` does not show worker specific info like worker_commit_timestamp anymore
- `bdr.worker_errors` is deprecated and lost most of the info
- `bdr.state_journal_details` is deprecated and lost most of the info
- `bdr.event_summary` replaces the `bdr.worker_errors` and
  `bdr.state_journal_details` with additional info like Raft role changes
- the table `bdr.node_catchup_info` now has user consumable view
  `bdr.node_catchup_info_details` which shows info in more friendly way
- witness node is no longer distinguished by which replication sets
  it replicates, but using `node_kind` value in `bdr.node_summary`
- all the Raft (consensus) related tables and functions were adjusted to support
  multiple Raft instances (sub-group Raft)
- `bdr.node_pre_commit` view and the underlying table was removed as the
  information is no longer stored in a table
- `bdr.commit_decisions` view was added and replaces the `bdr.node_pre_commit` one
- multiple internal autopatition tables were replaced by taskmgr ones as the
  mechanism behind was generalized
- `bdr.network_monitoring` view was removed along with underlying tables and
  functions
- many catalogs were added and some have new columns, as documented in the
  [Catalogs](/pgd/latest/bdr/catalogs) section of the documentation, these
  are not breaking changes strictly speaking but we recommend to review them
  when upgrading
