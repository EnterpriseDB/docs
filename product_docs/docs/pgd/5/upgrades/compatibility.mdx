title: Compatibility changes
---

Many changes in PGD 5 aren't backward compatible with
PGD 4 or PGD 3.7.

## Connection routing

HARP Manager doesn't exist anymore. It's been replaced by new
[connection management](../routing) configuration.

HARP Proxy is replaced by similarly functioning PGD Proxy, which removes any
deprecated features and is configured through connection
management configuration.

## Commit At Most Once

CAMO configuration is now done through [commit scopes](../durability/commit-scopes). The
`bdr.camo_pairs` catalog and any related manipulation functions don't exist
anymore. The `bdr.enable_camo` GUC was removed.
The `synchronous_replication_availability` GUC doesn't affect CAMO anymore.
Use the `DEGRADE ON ... TO ASYNC` clause of a commit scope.


## Eager all-node replication

The `global` scope no longer exists. To create scope with the same
behavior, use [group commit](../durability/group-commit).

```sql
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'eager_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'top_group',
    rule := 'ALL (top_group) GROUP COMMIT (conflict_resolution = eager, commit_decision = raft) ABORT ON (timeout = 60s)',
    wait_for_ready := true
);
```

The `bdr.global_commit_timeout` GUC was removed. Use the `ABORT ON` clause for the
commit scope.

## Lag control

Similarly to CAMO and eager, lag control configuration was also moved to
[commit scopes](../durability/commit-scopes) for more flexible durability configuration.

## Catalogs

- `bdr.workers` doesn't show worker-specific info like `worker_commit_timestamp` anymore.
- `bdr.worker_errors` is deprecated and lost most of the info.
- `bdr.state_journal_details` is deprecated and lost most of the info.
- `bdr.event_summary` replaces `bdr.worker_errors` and
  `bdr.state_journal_details` with additional info like Raft role changes.
- The table `bdr.node_catchup_info` now has the user-consumable view
  `bdr.node_catchup_info_details`, which shows info in a more friendly way.
- Witness node is no longer distinguished by the replication sets
  it replicates but by using the `node_kind` value in `bdr.node_summary`.
- All the Raft (consensus) related tables and functions were adjusted to support
  multiple Raft instances (sub-group Raft).
- `bdr.node_pre_commit` view and the underlying table was removed, as the
  information is no longer stored in a table.
- `bdr.commit_decisions` view was added and replaces the `bdr.node_pre_commit` one.
- Multiple internal autopartition tables were replaced by taskmgr ones, as the
  mechanism behind it was generalized.
- `bdr.network_monitoring` view was removed along with underlying tables and
  functions.
- Many catalogs were added and some have new columns, as described in
  [Catalogs](../catalogs). These
  aren't breaking changes strictly speaking, but we recommend reviewing them
  when upgrading.
