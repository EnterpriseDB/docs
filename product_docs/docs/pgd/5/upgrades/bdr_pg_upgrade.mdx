title: In-place Postgres major version upgrades
---

You can upgrade a PGD node to a newer major version of Postgres using the
command-line utility bdr_pg_upgrade.

bdr_pg_upgrade is a wrapper around the standard [pg_upgrade](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgupgrade.html)
adding PGD-specific logic to the process to ensure a smooth upgrade.

## Terminology

This terminology is used when describing the upgrade process and components involved:

*Postgres Cluster*: &mdash; The database files, both executables and data, which make up a Postgres database instance on a system when run. 

*Old Postgres cluster* &mdash; The existing Postgres cluster to upgrade, the one from which to migrate data.

*New Postgres cluster* &mdash; The new Postgres cluster that data is migrated to. This Postgres cluster must be one major version ahead of the old cluster.

## Precautions

Standard Postgres major version upgrade precautions apply, including the fact both Postgres clusters must meet
all the requirements for [pg_upgrade](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgupgrade.html#id-1.9.5.12.7.).

Additionally, don't use bdr_pg_upgrade if other tools are using
replication slots and replication origins. Only PGD slots and origins are
restored after the upgrade.

You must meet several prerequisites for bdr_pg_upgrade:

-   Disconnect applications using the old Postgres cluster. You can, for example,
    redirect them to another node in the PGD cluster.
-   Configure peer authentication for both Postgres clusters. bdr_pg_upgrade
    requires peer authentication.
-   PGD versions on both Postgres clusters must be exactly the same.
-   PGD versions must be 4.1.0 or later. PGD version 3.7.22 and later is also supported.
-   The new Postgres cluster must be in a shutdown state.
-   You must install PGD packages in the new Postgres cluster.
-   The new Postgres cluster must be already initialized and configured as needed to
    match the old Postgres cluster configuration.
-   Databases, tables, and other objects must not exist in the new Postgres cluster.

We also recommend having the old Postgres cluster up prior to running bdr_pg_upgrade.
The CLI starts the old Postgres cluster if it's shut down.

## Usage

To upgrade to a newer major version of Postgres, you must first install the new version.

### bdr_pg_upgrade command-line

bdr_pg_upgrade passes all parameters to pg_upgrade. Therefore, you can
specify any parameters supported by [pg_upgrade](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgupgrade.html#id-1.9.5.12.6). 

#### Synopsis

```shell
bdr_pg_upgrade [OPTION] ...
```

#### Options

In addition to the options for pg_upgrade, you can pass the following parameters
to bdr_pg_upgrade:

**Required parameters**

Specify these parameters either in the command line or, for all but the `--database` parameter, in their equivalent environment variable. They're used by bdr_pg_upgrade.

-   `-b, --old-bindir` &mdash; Old Postgres cluster bin directory.
-   `-B, --new-bindir`&mdash; New Postgres cluster bin directory.
-   `-d, --old-datadir` &mdash; Old Postgres cluster data directory.
-   `-D, --new-datadir` &mdash; New Postgres cluster data directory.
-   `--database` &mdash; PGD database name.

**Optional parameters**

These parameters are optional and are used by bdr_pg_upgrade.

-   `-p, --old-port` &mdash; Old cluster port number.
-   `-s, --socketdir` &mdash; Directory to use for postmaster sockets during upgrade.
-   `--check` &mdash; Specify to only perform checks and not modify clusters.

**Other parameters**

Any other parameter that's not one of the above is passed to pg_upgrade. pg_upgrade accepts the following parameters:

- `-j, --jobs` &mdash; Number of simultaneous processes or threads to use.
- `-k, --link` &mdash; Use hard links instead of copying files to the new cluster.
- `-o, --old-options` &mdash; Option to pass to old postgres command. Multiple invocations are appended.
- `-O, --new-options` &mdash; Option to pass to new postgres command. Multiple invocations are appended.
- `-N, --no-sync` &mdash; Don't wait for all files in the upgraded cluster to be written to disk.
- `-P, --new-port` &mdash; New cluster port number.
- `-r, --retain` &mdash; Retain SQL and log files even after successful completion.
- `-U, --username` &mdash; Cluster's install user name.
- `--clone` &mdash; Use efficient file cloning.

#### Environment variables

You can use these environment variables in place of command line parameters:

-   `PGBINOLD` &mdash; Old Postgres cluster bin directory.
-   `PGBINNEW` &mdash; New Postgres cluster bin directory.
-   `PGDATAOLD` &mdash; Old Postgres cluster data directory.
-   `PGDATANEW` &mdash; New Postgres cluster data directory.
-   `PGPORTOLD` &mdash; Old Postgres cluster port number.
-   `PGSOCKETDIR` &mdash; Directory to use for postmaster sockets during upgrade.


### Example

Given a scenario where:

-   Old Postgres cluster bin directory is `/usr/lib/postgresql/13/bin`.
-   New Postgres cluster bin directory is `/usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin`.
-   Old Postgres cluster data directory is `/var/lib/postgresql/13/main`.
-   New Postgres cluster data directory is `/var/lib/postgresql/14/main`.
-   Database name is `bdrdb`.


You can use the following command to upgrade the cluster:

```
bdr_pg_upgrade \
--old-bindir /usr/lib/postgresql/13/bin \
--new-bindir /usr/lib/postgresql/14/bin \
--old-datadir /var/lib/postgresql/13/main \
--new-datadir /var/lib/postgresql/14/main \
--database bdrdb
```

### Steps performed

These steps are performed when running bdr_pg_upgrade.

!!! Note
    When `--check` is supplied as an argument to bdr_pg_upgrade, the CLI
    skips steps that modify the database.
