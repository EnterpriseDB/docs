## Upgrading within version 5

You can upgrade from any version 5.x release to a later 5.x release. 

## Upgrading from version 4 to version 5

Upgrades from PGD 4 to PGD 5 are supported from version 4.3.0. For earlier
versions, upgrade to 4.3.0 before upgrading to 5. See [Upgrading within
4](/pgd/4/upgrades/upgrade_paths/#upgrading-within-version-4) for more
information. 

Generally, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version 4
release before upgrading to the latest version 5 release. After upgrading to
4.3.0 or later, the following upgrade paths are possible.

| From version | To version |
| ---- | -- |
| 4.3.0 | 5.0.0 or later |
| 4.3.1 | 5.1.0 or later |
| 4.3.2 | Upgrade to 5.3 (once it is released) |


## Upgrading from version 3.7 to version 5

At this time, TPA has enabled upgrades only from PGD 3.7 to 4 and PGD 4 to 5.
If you're moving from 3.7 to 5 and want automation, you need to use this
two-step upgrade path. Potentially, your proxy architecture will change
multiple times from HA Proxy to HARP and finally to PGD Proxy.

Significant development was done to make upgrading directly from 3.7 to 5
possible and easier. We've expanded the database versions supported with PGD 5
and enabled the upgradeability of the BDR extension across multiple PGD
versions. Previously, we supported upgrades only from the previous major
version. Often, a database upgrade was also required because only one database
major version was supported by both PGD versions.  

Development is currently ongoing to provide a direct upgrade path from 3.7 to 5
using TPA by Q4. In the interim, you can reach out to EDB Professional
Services or Support for assistance and guidance.
