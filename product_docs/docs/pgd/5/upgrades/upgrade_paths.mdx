## Upgrading from version 3.7 to version 5

At this time, TPA has only enabled upgrades from PGD 3.7 to 4 and PGD 4 to 5.
Customers moving from 3.7 to 5 and desiring automation would need to use this
two-step upgrade path and will potentially have their proxy architecture changed
multiple times from HA Proxy to HARP and finally to PGD Proxy.

Significant development has been done to make upgrading directly from 3.7 to 5
possible and easier. We've expanded the database versions supported with PGD 5
and enabled the upgradeability of the BDR extension across multiple PGD
versions. Previously, we only supported upgrades from the previous major
version. Often, a database upgrade was also required because only one database
major version was supported by both PGD versions.  

Development is currently ongoing to provide a direct upgrade path from 3.7 to 5
using TPA by Q4. In the interim, customers may reach out to EDB Professional
Services or Support for assistance and guidance.
