## Upgrading from version 3.7 to version 5

Upgrades directly from 3.7 to 5 may be possible by partnering with EDB
Professional Services, or reaching out to EDB support for assistance. 

Currently there are no direct upgrade paths from 3.7 to 5 using TPA. While it is
possible to upgrade your 3.7 cluster to 4.3.0 or later[^1],
you should be aware that you will be migrating to a proxy architecture that has
been superceded in PGD 5. We therefore recommend you work with EDB professional
services or EDB Support to perform a manual upgrade to 5, or hold off until a
direct upgrade option is available.

Development is underway to provide a direct upgrade path from 3.7 to 5 using TPA
by Q4.
