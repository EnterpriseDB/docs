TPA (Trusted Postgres Architect) is a standard automated way of installing PGD and Postgres on physical and virtual machines, 
both self-hosted and in the cloud (with AWS EC2).
 
!!! Note Get started with TPA and PGD quickly 

    If you want to experiment with a local deployment as quickly as possible, you can [deploying an EDB Postgres Distributed example cluster on Docker](/pgd/latest/quickstart/quick_start_docker) to configure, provision, and deploy a PGD 5 Always-On cluster on Docker.
    
    If deploying to the cloud is your aim, you can [deploying an EDB Postgres Distributed example cluster on AWS](/pgd/latest/quickstart/quick_start_aws) to get a PGD 5 cluster on your own Amazon account.

    If you want to run on your own Linux systems or VMs, you can use also use TPA to [deploy EDB Postgres Distributed directly to your own Linux hosts](/pgd/latest/quickstart/quick_start_linux) 

This section of the manual covers how to use TPA to deploy and administer EDB Postgres Distributed. 

* [Installing](installing) works through the steps needed to:
  * Installing TPA
  * Using TPA to create a configuration
  * Deploying the configuration with TPA

The installing section provides an example cluster which will be used in future examples.

You can also [perform a rolling major version upgrade](upgrading_major_rolling.mdx) with PGD administered by TPA.
