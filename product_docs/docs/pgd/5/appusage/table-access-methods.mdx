navTitle: Table access methods
---

PGD 5.0 supports two table access methods released with EDB Postgres 15.0. These
two table access methods have been certified and allowed in PGD 5.0:

 * Auto cluster
 * Ref data

Any other TAM is restricted until certified by EDB. If you are planning to use
any of the table access method on a table, you need to configure that TAM on
each participating node in the PGD cluster. To configure auto cluster or ref
data TAM, follow these steps on each node:

1.   Update `postgresql.conf` to specify TAMs `autocluster` or `refdata` for the
    `shared_preload_libraries` parameter.
1.   Restart the server and execute `CREATE EXTENSION autocluster;` or
    `CREATE EXTENSION refdata;`.

After you create the extension, you can use TAM to create a table using `CREATE
TABLE test USING autocluster;` or `CREATE TABLE test USING refdata;`. This
replicates to all the PGD nodes. For more information on these table access
methods, see [`CREATE TABLE`](/epas/latest/epas_compat_sql/36_create_table/).
