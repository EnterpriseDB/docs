navTitle: DML and DDL

PGD doesn't replicate the DML statement. It replicates the changes caused by the
DML statement. For example, an UPDATE that changed two rows replicates two
changes, whereas a DELETE that didn't remove any rows doesn't replicate
anything. This means that the results of executing volatile statements are
replicated, ensuring there's no divergence between nodes as might occur with
statement-based replication.

DDL replication works differently to DML. For DDL, PGD replicates the statement,
which then executes on all nodes. So a `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` might not
replicate anything on the local node, but the statement is still sent to other
nodes for execution if DDL replication is enabled. Full details are covered in
[DDL replication](ddl).

PGD works to ensure that intermixed DML and DDL statements work correctly, even
in the same transaction.
