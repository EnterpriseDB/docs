navTitle: DML and DDL replication
---

There are two major classes of SQL statement - DML and DDL. 

* DML is the Data Modification Language and is concerned with the SQL statements that modify the data stored in tables. It includes UPDATE, DELETE and INSERT. 

* DDL is the Data Definition Languages and it's concerned with the SQL statements that modify *how* the data is stored. It includes CREATE, ALTER and DROP.

Each class is handled differently by PGD.

## DML Replication

PGD doesn't replicate the DML statement. It replicates the changes caused by the
DML statement. For example, an UPDATE that changed two rows replicates two
changes, whereas a DELETE that didn't remove any rows doesn't replicate
anything. This means that the results of executing volatile statements are
replicated, ensuring there's no divergence between nodes as might occur with
statement-based replication.

## DDL Replication

DDL replication works differently to DML. For DDL, PGD replicates the statement,
which then executes on all nodes. So a `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` might not
replicate anything on the local node, but the statement is still sent to other
nodes for execution if DDL replication is enabled. Full details are covered in
[DDL replication](ddl).

PGD works to ensure that intermixed DML and DDL statements work correctly, even
in the same transaction.

## Nonreplicated statements

Outside of those two classes are SQL commands which PGD does not, by design,
replicate. None of the following user commands are replicated by PGD, so their
effects occur on the local/origin node only:

-   Cursor operations (DECLARE, CLOSE, FETCH)
-   Execution commands (DO, CALL, PREPARE, EXECUTE, EXPLAIN)
-   Session management (DEALLOCATE, DISCARD, LOAD)
-   Parameter commands (SET, SHOW)
-   Constraint manipulation (SET CONSTRAINTS)
-   Locking commands (LOCK)
-   Table maintenance commands (VACUUM, ANALYZE, CLUSTER, REINDEX)
-   Async operations (NOTIFY, LISTEN, UNLISTEN)

Since the `NOTIFY` SQL command and the `pg_notify()` functions aren't
replicated, notifications aren't reliable in case of failover. This means that
notifications can easily be lost at failover if a transaction is committed just
when the server crashes. Applications running `LISTEN` might miss notifications
in case of failover.

This is true in standard PostgreSQL replication, and PGD doesn't yet improve on
this. 

CAMO and Eager Replication options don't allow the `NOTIFY` SQL command or the
`pg_notify()` function.
