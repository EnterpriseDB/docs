Much of PGD's replication behavior is transparent to applications. Understanding how it
achieves that and the elements that aren't transparent is important to successfully developing
an application that works well with PGD.

### Replication behavior

PGD supports replicating changes made on one node to other nodes.

PGD, by default, replicates all changes from INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and TRUNCATE
operations from the source node to other nodes. Only the final changes are sent,
after all triggers and rules are processed. For example, `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT
UPDATE` sends either an insert or an update, depending on what occurred on the
origin. If an update or delete affects zero rows, then no changes are sent.

You can replicate INSERT without any preconditions.

For updates and deletes to replicate on other nodes, PGD must be able to
identify the unique rows affected. PGD requires that a table have either a
PRIMARY KEY defined, a UNIQUE constraint, or an explicit REPLICA IDENTITY
defined on specific columns. If one of those isn't defined, a warning is
generated, and later updates or deletes are explicitly blocked. If REPLICA
IDENTITY FULL is defined for a table, then a unique index isn't required. In
that case, updates and deletes are allowed and use the first non-unique index
that's live, valid, not deferred, and doesn't have expressions or WHERE clauses.
Otherwise, a sequential scan is used.

### Truncate

You can use TRUNCATE even without a defined replication identity. Replication of
TRUNCATE commands is supported, but take care when truncating groups of tables
connected by foreign keys. When replicating a truncate action, the subscriber
truncates the same group of tables that was truncated on the origin, either
explicitly specified or implicitly collected by CASCADE, except in cases where
replication sets are defined. See [Replication sets](../repsets) for
details and examples. This works correctly if all affected tables are part of
the same subscription. But if some tables to truncate on the subscriber have
foreign-key links to tables that aren't part of the same (or any) replication
set, then applying the truncate action on the subscriber fails.

### Row-level locks

Row-level locks taken implicitly by INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE commands are
replicated as the changes are made. Table-level locks taken implicitly by
INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and TRUNCATE commands are also replicated. Explicit
row-level locking (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE/FOR SHARE`) by user sessions isn't
replicated, nor are advisory locks. Information stored by transactions running
in SERIALIZABLE mode isn't replicated to other nodes. The transaction isolation
level of SERIALIAZABLE is supported, but transactions aren't serialized across
nodes in the presence of concurrent transactions on multiple nodes.

If DML is executed on multiple nodes concurrently, then potential conflicts
might occur if executing with asynchronous replication. You must either handle
these or avoid them. Various avoidance mechanisms are possible, discussed in
[Conflicts](../consistency/conflicts).

### Sequences

Sequences need special handling, described in [Sequences](../sequences). This is
because in a cluster, sequences must be global to avoid nodes creating
conflicting values. Global sequences are available with global locking to ensure
integrity.

### Binary objects

Binary data in BYTEA columns is replicated normally, allowing "blobs" of data up
to 1 GB. Use of the PostgreSQL "large object" facility isn't supported in PGD.

### Rules

Rules execute only on the origin node so aren't executed during apply,
even if they're enabled for replicas.

### Base tables only

Replication is possible only from base tables to base tables. That is, the
tables on the source and target on the subscription side must be tables, not
views, materialized views, or foreign tables. Attempts to replicate tables other
than base tables result in an error. DML changes that are made through updatable
views are resolved to base tables on the origin and then applied to the same
base table name on the target.

### Partitioned tables

PGD supports partitioned tables transparently, meaning that you can add a
partitioned table to a replication set and changes that involve any of the
partitions are replicated downstream.

### Triggers

By default, triggers execute only on the origin node. For example, an INSERT
trigger executes on the origin node and is ignored when you apply the change on
the target node. You can specify for triggers to execute on both the origin node
at execution time and on the target when it's replicated ("apply time") by using
`ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ALWAYS TRIGGER`. Or, use the `REPLICA` option to execute
only at apply time: `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE REPLICA TRIGGER`.

Some types of trigger aren't executed on apply, even if they exist on a
table and are currently enabled. Trigger types not executed are:

-   Statement-level triggers (`FOR EACH STATEMENT`)
-   Per-column UPDATE triggers (`UPDATE OF column_name [, ...]`)

PGD replication apply uses the system-level default search_path. Replica
triggers, stream triggers, and index expression functions can assume other
search_path settings that then fail when they execute on apply. To prevent this
from occurring, use any of these techniques:

-  Resolve object references clearly using only the default search_path. 
-  Always use fully qualified references to objects, for example, `schema.objectname`. 
-  Set the search path for a function using `ALTER FUNCTION ... SET search_path
   = ...` for the functions affected.

PGD assumes that there are no issues related to text or other collatable
datatypes, that is, all collations in use are available on all nodes, and the
default collation is the same on all nodes. Replicating changes uses equality
searches to locate Replica Identity values, so this does't have any effect
except where unique indexes are explicitly defined with nonmatching collation
qualifiers. Row filters might be affected by differences in collations if
collatable expressions were used.

### Toast

PGD handling of very long "toasted" data in PostgreSQL is transparent to the
user. The TOAST "chunkid" values likely differ between the same row on different
nodes, but that doesn't cause any problems.

### Other restrictions

PGD can't work correctly if Replica Identity columns are marked as external.

PostgreSQL allows CHECK() constraints that contain volatile functions. Since PGD
reexecutes CHECK() constraints on apply, any subsequent reexecution that
doesn't return the same result as before causes data divergence.

PGD doesn't restrict the use of foreign keys. Cascading FKs are allowed.
