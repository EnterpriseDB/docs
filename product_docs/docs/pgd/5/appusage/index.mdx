Developing an application with PGD is predominantly the same as working with any PostgreSQL database. What is different, though, is that you need to be aware of how your application will interact with replication. Detailed in this section are how PGD behaves with applications, what SQL is and isn't replicated, how different nodes are handled and other important information for application developers.

* [Application behavior](behavior) looks at how PGD replication appears to an application. Which commands are replicated, which run locally, when row-level locks are acquired, how and where triggers fire, large objects, toast, and more are covered.

* [DML and DDL replication](dml-and-ddl) shows what the differences between the two classes of SQL statements are and how PGD handles replicating them. It also looks at which commands PGD doesn't replicate at all.

* [Nodes with differences](differences) examines how PGD worls with configurations where there are differing table structures and schemas on replicated nodes. Also covered is how to compare between such nodes with LiveCompare and how differences of PostgreSQL versions running on nodes can be handled.

* [Application rules](rules) offers some general rules for applications to avoid data anomalies.

* [Timing considerations](timing) shows how the asynchronous/synchronous replication may affect an applications view of data and notes functions to mitigate stale reads.

* [Table access methods](table-access-methods) (TAMs) notes which TAMs are available with PGD and how to enable them.
