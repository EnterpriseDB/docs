None of the following user commands are replicated by PGD, so their effects
occur on the local/origin node only:

-   Cursor operations (DECLARE, CLOSE, FETCH)
-   Execution commands (DO, CALL, PREPARE, EXECUTE, EXPLAIN)
-   Session management (DEALLOCATE, DISCARD, LOAD)
-   Parameter commands (SET, SHOW)
-   Constraint manipulation (SET CONSTRAINTS)
-   Locking commands (LOCK)
-   Table maintenance commands (VACUUM, ANALYZE, CLUSTER, REINDEX)
-   Async operations (NOTIFY, LISTEN, UNLISTEN)

Since the `NOTIFY` SQL command and the `pg_notify()` functions aren't
replicated, notifications aren't reliable in case of failover. This means that
notifications can easily be lost at failover if a transaction is committed just
when the server crashes. Applications running `LISTEN` might miss notifications
in case of failover.

This is true in standard PostgreSQL replication, and PGD doesn't yet improve on
this. 

CAMO and Eager Replication options don't allow the `NOTIFY` SQL command or the
`pg_notify()` function.
