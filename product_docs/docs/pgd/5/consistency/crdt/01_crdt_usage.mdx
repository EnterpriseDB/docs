## Using CRDTs in tables

!!! Note Permissions required
PGD CRDTs require usage access to CRDT types. Therefore, any user needing to access CRDT types must have at least the [bdr_application](../../security/pgd-predefined-roles/#bdr_application) role assigned to them.
!!!

To use CRDTs, you need to use a particular data type in CREATE/ALTER TABLE rather than standard built-in data types such as `integer`.

### Non-CRDT example

Consider the following table with one regular integer counter and a single row:

```sql
CREATE TABLE non_crdt_example (
    id      integer				PRIMARY KEY,
    counter integer				NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

INSERT INTO non_crdt_example (id) VALUES (1);
```

Suppose you issue the following SQL on two different nodes at same time:

```sql
UPDATE non_crdt_example
   SET counter = counter + 1    -- "reflexive" update
 WHERE id = 1;
```

After both updates are applied, you can see the resulting values using this query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM non_crdt_example WHERE id = 1;
   id |   counter
 -----+-----------
    1 |         1
(1 row)
```

This code shows that you lost one of the increments due to the `update_if_newer` conflict resolver. 

### CRDT example

This example shows how to use a CRDT counter data type instead of a non-CRDT type.

Create the table but with a CRDT (`bdr.crdt_gcounter`) as the counter data type:

```sql
CREATE TABLE crdt_example (
    id      integer				PRIMARY KEY,
    counter bdr.crdt_gcounter	NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);
```

Configure the table for column-level conflict resolution:

```sql
ALTER TABLE crdt_example REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;

SELECT bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection('crdt_example',
			'column_modify_timestamp', 'cts');
```

Insert a row with a value for this example:

```
INSERT INTO crdt_example (id) VALUES (1);
```

Suppose you now issue the same SQL on two nodes at same time as you did in the non-CRDT example: 

```sql
UPDATE crdt_example
   SET counter = counter + 1    -- "reflexive" update
 WHERE id = 1;
```

Once the changes are applied, you find that the counter has managed two concurrent updates:

```sql
SELECT id, counter FROM crdt_example WHERE id = 1;
   id |   counter
 -----+-----------
    1 |         2
(1 row)
```

This example shows that the CRDT correctly allows the accumulator columns to work, even in the face of asynchronous concurrent updates that otherwise conflict.

## Configuration options

The `bdr.crdt_raw_value` configuration option determines whether queries return the current value or the full internal state of the CRDT type. By default, only the current numeric value is returned. When set to `true`, queries return representation of the full state. You can use the special hash operator
(`#`) to request only the current numeric value without using the special operator (the default behavior). If the full state is dumped using `bdr.crdt_raw_value = on`, then the value can reload only with `bdr.crdt_raw_value = on`.

!!! Note
    The `bdr.crdt_raw_value` option applies formatting only of data returned to clients, that is, simple column references in the select list. Any column references in other parts of the query, such as `WHERE` clause or even expressions in the select list, might still require use of the `#` operator.

## Different types of CRDTs

The `crdt_gcounter` type is an example of state-based CRDT types that work only with reflexive UPDATE SQL, such as `x = x + 1`, as the next example shows.

Another class of CRDTs are *delta CRDT* types. These are a special subclass of [operation-based CRDT](02_state-op-crdts#operation-based-crdt-types-cmcrdt).

With delta CRDTs, any update to a value is compared to the previous value on the same node. Then a change is applied as a delta on all other nodes.

```sql
CREATE TABLE crdt_delta_example (
    id       integer            PRIMARY KEY,
    counter  bdr.crdt_delta_counter NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

ALTER TABLE crdt_delta_example REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;

SELECT bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection('crdt_delta_example',
			'column_modify_timestamp', 'cts');

INSERT INTO crdt_delta_example (id) VALUES (1);
```

Suppose you issue the following SQL on two nodes at same time:

```sql
UPDATE crdt_delta_example
   SET counter = 2          -- notice NOT counter = counter + 2
 WHERE id = 1;
```

After both updates are applied, you can see the resulting values using this query:

```sql
SELECT id, counter FROM crdt_delta_example WHERE id = 1;
   id | counter
 -----+---------
    1 |       4
(1 row)
```

With a regular `integer` column, the result is `2`. But when you update the row with a delta CRDT counter, you start with the OLD row version, make a NEW row version, and send both to the remote node. There, compare them with the version found there (for example, the LOCAL version). Standard CRDTs merge the NEW and the LOCAL version. Delta CRDTs compare the OLD and NEW versions and apply the delta
to the LOCAL version.

## Query planning and optimization

An important question is how query planning and optimization works with these new data types. CRDT types are handled transparently. Both `ANALYZE` and the optimizer work, so estimation and query planning work fine without having to do anything else.
