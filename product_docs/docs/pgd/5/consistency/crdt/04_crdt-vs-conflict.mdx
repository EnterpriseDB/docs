## CRDT types versus conflicts handling

As tables can contain both CRDT and non-CRDT columns (most columns are expected to be non-CRDT), you need to do both the regular conflict resolution and CRDT merge.

The conflict resolution happens first and is responsible for deciding the tuple to keep (applytuple) and the one to discard. The merge phase happens next, merging data for CRDT columns from the discarded
tuple into the applytuple.

!!! Note
    This handling makes CRDT types somewhat more expensive compared to plain conflict resolution because the merge needs to happen every time. This is the case even when the conflict resolution can use one of the fast paths (such as those modified in the current transaction).

## CRDT types versus conflict reporting

By default, detected conflicts are individually reported. Without CRDT types, this makes sense because the conflict resolution essentially throws away half of the available information (local or remote row, depending on configuration). This presents a data loss.

CRDT types allow both parts of the information to be combined without throwing anything away, eliminating the data loss issue. This approach makes the conflict reporting unnecessary.

For this reason, conflict reporting is skipped when the conflict can be fully resolved by CRDT merge. Each column must meet at least one of these two conditions:

-  The values in local and remote tuple are the same (NULL or equal).
-  It uses a CRDT data type and so can be merged.

!!! Note
    Conflict reporting is also skipped when there are no CRDT columns but all values in local/remote tuples are equal.
