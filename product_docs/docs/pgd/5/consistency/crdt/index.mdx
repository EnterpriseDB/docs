Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) support merging values from concurrently modified rows instead of discarding one of the rows as the traditional resolution does.

- [Overview](00_crdt_overview) provides an introduction to CRDTs. 

- [Using CRDTs](01_crdt_usage) investigates how to use CRDTs in tables, reviews some configuration options, and reviews some examples of CRDTs and how they work.

- [Operation-based and state-based CRDTs](02_state-op-crdts) reviews the differences between operation-based and state-based CRDTs.

- [Disk-space requirements](03_crdt-disk-reqs) covers disk-size considerations for CRDTs, especially state-based CRDTs.

- [CRDTs versus conflict handling/reporting](04_crdt-vs-conflict) explains how conflict handling and reporting works with CRDTs.

- [Resetting CRDT values](05_crdt-reset) discusses the challenges of resetting CRDT values and provides some guidance on doing so successfully.

- [Implemented CRDTs](06_crdt-implemented) details each of the six CRDTs available in PGD, with implementation examples.
