## Introduction to CRDTs

Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) support merging values from concurrently modified rows instead of discarding one of the rows as the traditional resolution does.
 
Each CRDT type is implemented as a separate PostgreSQL data type with an extra callback added to the `bdr.crdt_handlers` catalog. The merge process happens inside the PGD writer on the apply side without any user action needed.

CRDTs require the table to have column-level conflict resolution enabled, as described in [Column-level conflict resolution](../column-level-conflicts/02_enabling_disabling.mdx).

## CRDTs in PostgreSQL

[The CRDTs](06_crdt-implemented) are installed as part of `bdr` into the `bdr` schema. For convenience, the basic operators (`+`, `#`, and `!`) and a number of common aggregate functions (`min`, `max`, `sum`, and `avg`) are created in `pg_catalog`. Thus they are available without having to tweak `search_path`.
