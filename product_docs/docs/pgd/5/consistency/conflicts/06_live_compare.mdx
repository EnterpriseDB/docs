title: Data verification with LiveCompare
Description: Explains the uses of LiveCompare for data verification.
---

LiveCompare is a utility program designed to compare any two databases to verify that they are identical.

LiveCompare is included as part of the PGD stack and can be aimed at any pair of PGD nodes. By default, it compares all replicated tables and reports differences. LiveCompare also works with non-PGD data sources such as Postgres and Oracle.

You can also use LiveCompare to continuously monitor incoming rows. You can stop and start it without losing context information, so you can run it at convenient times.

LiveCompare allows concurrent checking of multiple tables. You can configure it to allow checking of a few tables or just a section of rows in a table. Checks are performed by first comparing whole
row hashes. If different, LiveCompare then compares whole rows. LiveCompare avoids overheads by comparing rows in useful-sized batches.

If differences are found, they can be rechecked over time, allowing for the delays of eventual consistency.

See the [LiveCompare](/livecompare/latest/) documentation for further details.
