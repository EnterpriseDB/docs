EDB Postgres Distributed is an active/active or multi-master DBMS. If used asynchronously, writes to the same or related rows from multiple different nodes can result in data conflicts when using standard data types.

Conflicts aren't errors. In most cases, they are events that PGD can detect and resolve as they occur. This section introduces the PGD functionality that allows you to manage that detection and resolution.

- [Overview](00_conflicts_overview) introduces the idea of conflicts in PGD and explains how they can happen.

- [Types of conflicts](02_types_of_conflict) lists and discusses the various sorts of conflicts you might run across in PGD.

- [Conflict detection](03_conflict_detection) introduces the mechanisms PGD provides for conflict detection. 

- [Conflict resolution](04_conflict_resolution) explains how PGD resolves conflicts and how you can change the default behavior.

- [Conflict logging](05_conflict_logging) points out where PGD keeps conflict logs and explains how you can perform conflict reporting.

- [Data verification with LiveCompare](06_live_compare) explains how LiveCompare can help keep data consistent by pointing out conflicts as they arise.
