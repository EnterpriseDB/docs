title: Conflict logging
Description: How PGD logs database conflicts.
deepToC: true

To ease diagnosing and handling multi-master conflicts, PGD, by default, logs every conflict into the `bdr.conflict_history` table. You can change this behavior with more granularity using [bdr.alter_node_set_log_config](../../reference/conflicts/bdr.alter_node_set_log_config).

## Conflict reporting

You can summarize conflicts logged to tables in reports. Reports allow application owners to identify, understand, and resolve conflicts and introduce application changes to prevent them.

```sql
SELECT nspname, relname
, date_trunc('day', local_time) :: date AS date
, count(*)
FROM bdr.conflict_history
WHERE local_time > date_trunc('day', current_timestamp)
GROUP BY 1,2,3
ORDER BY 1,2;

 nspname | relname |    date    | count
---------+---------+------------+-------
 my_app  | test    | 2019-04-05 |     1
(1 row)
```
