title: Eager conflict resolution
---

Eager conflict resolution (also known as Eager Replication) prevents conflicts
by aborting transactions that conflict with each other with serializable error
during the COMMIT decision process.

It is configured using [Commit Scopes](/pgd/latest/durability/commit-scopes)
as one of the conflict resolution options for
[Group Commit](/pgd/latest/durability/group-commit).

## Usage

To enable Eager conflict resolution, the client needs to switch to
a Commit Scope which uses it at session level or for individual transactions
as shown here:

```sql
BEGIN;

SET LOCAL bdr.commit_scope = 'eager_scope';

... other commands possible...
```

The client can continue to issue a `COMMIT` at the end of the
transaction and let BDR manage the two phases:

```sql
COMMIT;
```

In this case the `eager_scope` commit scope would be defined something like this:

```sql
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'eager_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'top_group',
    rule := 'ALL (top_group) GROUP COMMIT (conflict_resolution = eager, commit_decision = raft) ABORT ON (timeout = 60s)'
);
```

!!! Upgrade note
    The old `global` commit scope does not exist anymore and the above command
    creates scope that is same as the old `global` scope with
    `bdr.global_commit_timeout` set to `60s`.

## Error handling

Given that BDR manages the transaction, the client needs to check only the
result of the `COMMIT`. (This is advisable in any case, including single-node
Postgres.)

In case of an origin node failure, the remaining nodes eventually
(after at least `ABORT ON timeout`) decide to roll back the
globally prepared transaction. Raft prevents inconsistent commit versus
rollback decisions. However, this requires a majority of connected
nodes. Disconnected nodes keep the transactions prepared
to eventually commit them (or roll back) as needed to reconcile with the
majority of nodes that might have decided and made further progress.

## Effects of Eager Replication in general

#### Increased commit latency

Adding a synchronization step means additional communication between
the nodes, resulting in additional latency at commit time. Eager All-Node
Replication adds roughly two network roundtrips (to the furthest
peer node in the worst case). Logical standby nodes and nodes still
in the process of joining or catching up aren't included but
eventually receive changes.

Before a peer node can confirm its local preparation of the
transaction, it also needs to apply it locally. This further adds to
the commit latency, depending on the size of the transaction.
This is independent of the `synchronous_commit` setting.

#### Increased abort rate

With single-node Postgres, or even with BDR in its default asynchronous
replication mode, errors at `COMMIT` time are rare. The additional
synchronization step adds a source of errors, so applications need to
be prepared to properly handle such errors (usually by applying a
retry loop).

The rate of aborts depends solely on the workload. Large transactions
changing many rows are much more likely to conflict with other
concurrent transactions.
