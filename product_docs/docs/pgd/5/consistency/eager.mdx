Eager conflict resolution (also known as Eager Replication) prevents conflicts by aborting transactions that conflict with each other with serializable errors during the COMMIT decision process.

You configure it using [commit scopes](../durability/commit-scopes) as one of the conflict resolution options for [Group Commit](../durability/group-commit).

## Usage

To enable Eager conflict resolution, the client needs to switch to a commit scope, which uses it at session level or for individual transactions as shown here:

```sql
BEGIN;

SET LOCAL bdr.commit_scope = 'eager_scope';

... other commands possible...
```

The client can continue to issue a `COMMIT` at the end of the transaction and let PGD manage the two phases:

```sql
COMMIT;
```

In this case, the `eager_scope` commit scope is defined something like this:

```sql
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'eager_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'top_group',
    rule := 'ALL (top_group) GROUP COMMIT (conflict_resolution = eager, commit_decision = raft) ABORT ON (timeout = 60s)',
    wait_for_ready := true
);
```

!!! note Upgrading?
    The old `global` commit scope doesn't exist anymore. The above command creates a scope that's the same as the old `global` scope with `bdr.global_commit_timeout` set to `60s`.

The commit scope group for the Eager conflict resolution rule can only be `ALL` or `MAJORITY`. Where `ALL` is used, the `commit_decision` setting must also be set to `raft`.

## Error handling

Given that PGD manages the transaction, the client needs to check only the result of the `COMMIT`. This is advisable in any case, including single-node Postgres.

In case of an origin node failure, the remaining nodes eventually (after at least `ABORT ON timeout`) decide to roll back the globally prepared transaction. Raft prevents inconsistent commit versus rollback decisions. However, this requires a majority of connected nodes. Disconnected nodes keep the transactions prepared to eventually commit them (or roll back) as needed to reconcile with the majority of nodes that might have decided and made further progress.

## Effects of Eager Replication in general

#### Increased abort rate

With single-node Postgres, or even with PGD in its default asynchronous
replication mode, errors at `COMMIT` time are rare. The added synchronization 
step due to the use of a commit scope using Eager
for conflict resolution also adds a source of errors. Applications need to be
prepared to properly handle such errors, usually by applying a retry loop.

The rate of aborts depends solely on the workload. Large transactions changing many rows are much more likely to conflict with other concurrent transactions.

## Effects of MAJORITY and ALL node replication in general

### Increased commit latency

Adding a synchronization step due to the use of a commit scope means more
communication between the nodes, resulting in more latency at commit time. When
`ALL` is used in the commit scope, this also means that the availability of the
system is reduced, since any node going down causes transactions to fail. 

If one or more nodes are lagging behind, the round-trip delay in getting
confirmations can be large, causing high latencies. ALL or MAJORITY node replication adds
roughly two network round trips (to the furthest peer node in the worst case).
Logical standby nodes and nodes still in the process of joining or catching up
aren't included but eventually receive changes.

Before a peer node can confirm its local preparation of the transaction, it also
needs to apply it locally. This further adds to the commit latency, depending on
the size of the transaction. This setting is independent of the
`synchronous_commit` setting.
