EDB Postgres Distributed is an active/active or multi-master DBMS. If used
asynchronously, writes to the same or related rows from multiple different
nodes can result in data [conflicts](conflicts) when using standard data types.

Conflicts aren't errors. In most cases, they are events that PGD can detect
and resolve as they occur. Resolution depends on the
nature of the application and the meaning of the data, so it's important that
PGD provides the application a range of choices as to how to resolve
[conflicts](conflicts).

By default, conflicts are resolved at the row level. When changes from two
nodes conflict, either the local or remote tuple is picked and the other
is discarded. For example, the commit timestamps might be compared for the two conflicting
changes and the newer one kept. This approach ensures that all nodes converge to the
same result and establishes commit-order-like semantics on the whole cluster.

Column-level conflict detection and resolution is available with PGD,
described in [CLCD](column-level-conflicts).

If you want to avoid conflicts, you can use
[Group Commit](/pgd/latest/durability/group-commit) with
[Eager Conflict Resolution](eager) or Conflict-free data types (CRDTs),
described in [CRDT](crdt)
