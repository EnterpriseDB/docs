By default, conflicts are resolved at row level. When changes from two nodes conflict, either the local or remote tuple is selected and the other is discarded. For example, commit timestamps for the two conflicting changes might be compared and the newer one kept. This approach ensures that all nodes converge to the same result and establishes commit-order-like semantics on the whole cluster.

However, it might sometimes be appropriate to resolve conflicts at the column level rather than the row level, at least in some cases.

* [Overview](01_overview_clcd) introduces the notion of a column-level conflict in contrast to row-level conflicts.

* [Enabling and disabling](02_enabling_disabling) provides an example of enabling column-level conflict resolution and introduces [`bdr.column_timestamps_create`](02_enabling_disabling/#bdrcolumn_timestamps_create).

* [Timestamps](03_timestamps) explicates how timestamps can be selected and inspected.
