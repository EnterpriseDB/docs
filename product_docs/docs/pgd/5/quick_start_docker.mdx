  A quick demonstration of deploying a PGD architecture using TPA on Docker
---


The following steps set up EDB Postgres Distributed with an Always On Single Location
architecture using local Docker containers. This platform is not suitable for production use, but can be valuable for testing the functionality and behavior of PGD clusters; you may also find it useful when familiarizing yourself with PGD commands and APIs in preparation for deployment on cloud, VM, or bare-metal platforms.

## Prerequisites

You'll need to install and configure several software packages in order to complete this example. 

### Linux environment

[TPA supports several flavors of Linux](/tpa/latest/INSTALL/) as a host platform - you should have one of them at your disposal. 

!!! Important
    If you're running cgroup v2, you'll need to disable it while using TPA to deploy to Docker. The [TPA Docker Platform](/tpa/latest/platform-docker/#cgroupversion) topic contains instructions for disabling cgroup v2.

### Free disk space

You'll need at least 5GB of free storage (accessible by Docker) to deploy the cluster described by this example. A bit more is probably wise.

### Docker desktop

https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/

We'll be using Docker containers as the target platform for this PGD deployment, so you should have Docker installed and configured.

### EDB subscription

You'll need an EDB subscription in order to install TPA *and* in order to deploy PGD. 

[Sign up for a free EDB account](https://www.enterprisedb.com/accounts/register) if you don't already have one - this will give you a trial subscription to EDB's software repositories. 

Then obtain your repo token from [EDB Repos 2.0](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) by clicking the Repo Access link and copying the value labeled "Repo Token".

### Trusted Postgres Architect

We'll use the Trusted Postgres Architect (TPA) to provision and deploy PGD. You'll find instructions for installing it in the [Trusted Postgres Architect documentation](/tpa/latest/INSTALL/).

## Generate a configuration file:

First, set the `EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN` environmental variable to your EDB repo token.

```shell
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=<token>
```

Then run `tpaexec configure` to generate a configuration folder.

```shell
tpaexec configure myedbdpcluster --architecture PGD-Always-ON --platform docker --location-names eu-west-1 --data-nodes-per-location 3 --no-git
```

This creates a subdirectory directory in current working directory called `myedbdpcluster` containing the `config.yml` configuration file TPA uses to create the cluster.

```shell
less myedbdpcluster/config.yml
```

Edit the `config.yml` as needed, for example to change the IP address range used for servers or adjust locations of nodes.

We included options to specify using Docker, a single location, and three data nodes. By default, PGD will also configure two [PGD Proxy](routing/proxy/) nodes and a [Barman](backup#physical-backup) node for backup. Other interesting defaults include PostgreSQL 15 running on each of the three data nodes, and Rocky Linux as the base OS for all nodes.

For simplicity in this example, we're passing the `--no-git` flag - this will prevent TPA from trying to commit configuration changes to a Git repository. 


### Provision the cluster:
   
```shell
tpaexec provision myedbdpcluster
```

Since we specified Docker as the platform, TPA provisions an image, containers, networks, etc.

### Deploy the cluster: 

```shell
tpaexec deploy myedbdpcluster
```

TPA installs the needed packages, applies the configuration and sets up the actual EDB Postgres Distributed cluster
   
### Test the cluster:
   
After the successful run of the `deploy` command the cluster is ready to use. You can connect to it via `psql` or any other database client.

It's also possible to run a test that ensures the cluster is running as expected:

```shell
tpaexec test myedbdpcluster
```
