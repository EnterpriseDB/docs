## `bdr.replication_set_add_table`

This function adds a table to a replication set.

This function adds a table to a replication set and starts replicating changes
from the committing of the transaction that contains the call to the function. Any existing data the table
might have on a node isn't synchronized.
Replication of this command is affected by DDL replication configuration,
including DDL filtering settings.

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.replication_set_add_table(relation regclass,
                              set_name name DEFAULT NULL,
                              columns text[] DEFAULT NULL,
                              row_filter text DEFAULT NULL)
```

### Parameters

-   `relation` &mdash; Name or Oid of a table.
-   `set_name` &mdash; Name of the replication set. If NULL (the default), then the PGD
     group default replication set is used.
-   `columns` &mdash; Reserved for future use (currently does nothing and must be NULL).
-   `row_filter` &mdash; SQL expression to use for filtering the replicated rows.
    If this expression isn't defined (that is, it's set to NULL, the default) then all rows are sent.

The `row_filter` specifies an expression producing a Boolean result, with NULLs.
Expressions evaluating to True or Unknown replicate the row. A False value
doesn't replicate the row. Expressions can't contain subqueries or refer to
variables other than columns of the current row being replicated. You can't reference system
columns.

`row_filter` executes on the origin node, not on the target node. This puts an
additional CPU overhead on replication for this specific table but
completely avoids sending data for filtered rows. Hence network
bandwidth is reduced and overhead on the target node is applied.

`row_filter` never removes `TRUNCATE` commands for a specific table.
You can filter away `TRUNCATE` commands at the replication set level.

You can replicate just some columns of a table. See
[Replicating between nodes with differences](../appusage).

### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This means
that the replication is affected by the [DDL filters](../repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration.

If the `row_filter` isn't NULL, the function takes a `DML` global lock on the relation that's being
added to the replication set. Otherwise
it takes just a `DDL` global lock.

This function is transactional. You can roll back the effects with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction. The changes are visible to the current
transaction.

## `bdr.replication_set_remove_table`

This function removes a table from the replication set.

Replication of this command is affected by DDL replication configuration,
including DDL filtering settings.

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.replication_set_remove_table(relation regclass,
                                 set_name name DEFAULT NULL)
```

### Parameters

-   `relation` &mdash; Name or Oid of a table.
-   `set_name` &mdash; Name of the replication set. If NULL (the default), then the PGD
     group default replication set is used.
