## Going further with your PGD cluster

### Architecture

In this quick start, we created a single region cluster of high availability Postgres databases. This is the, Always On Single Location architecture, one of a range of available  PGD architectures. Other architectures include Always On Multi-Location, with clusters in multiple data centers working together, and variations of both with witness nodes enhancing resilience. Read more in [architectural options](../architectures/).

### Postgres versions

In this quick start, we deployed EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) to the database nodes. PGD is able to deploy a three different kinds of Postgres distributions, EPAS, EDB Postgres Extended Server and open-source PostgreSQL. The selection of database affects PGD, offering [different capabilities](../choosing_server) dependant on server.

* open-source PostgreSQL does not support CAMO
* EDB Postgres Extended Server supports CAMO, but does not offer Oracle compatibility
* EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports CAMO and offers optional Oracle compatibility

### Read On

* Learn PGD's [terminology](../terminology/) - from Asynchronous Replication to Write Scalability
* Find out how [applications work](../appusage/) with PGD and how common Postgres features like [sequences](../sequences/) are globally distributed
* Discover how PGD supports [rolling upgrades](../upgrades/) of your clusters
* Take control of [routing](../routing/) and use SQL to control the PGD Proxies
* Engage with the [PGD CLI](../cli/) to manage and monitor your cluster


## Deprovisioning the cluster

When you're done testing the cluster, you'll want to deprovision it. 

```shell
tpaexec deprovision democluster
```

* With a Docker deployment, deprovisioning tears down the Docker containers, network, and other local configuration. 
* With an AWS deployment, it will remove the EC2 instances, VPC configuration and other associated resources. Note that it will leave the S3 bucket it create; this will have to be manually removed.
