## Going further with your PGD cluster

* Learn PGD's [terminology](../terminology/) - from Asynchronous Replication to Write Scalability
* Discover the [architectural options](../architectures/) available with PGD
* Find out how [applications work](../appusage/) with PGD and how common Postgres features like [sequences](../sequences/) are globally distributed
* Take control of [routing](../routing/) and use SQL to control the PGD Proxies
* Engage with the [PGD CLI](../cli/) to manage and monitor your cluster


## Deprovisioning the cluster

When you're done testing the cluster, you'll want to deprovision it. 

```shell
tpaexec deprovision democluster
```

* With a Docker deployment, deprovisioning tears down the Docker containers, network, and other local configuration. 
* With an AWS deployment, it will remove the EC2 instances, VPC configuration and other associated resources. Note that it will leave the S3 bucket it create; this will have to be manually removed.
