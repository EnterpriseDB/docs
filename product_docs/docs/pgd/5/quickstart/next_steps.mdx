## Further exercises with your PGD cluster



## Deprovisioning the cluster

When you're done testing the cluster, you'll want to deprovision it. 

```shell
tpaexec deprovision democluster
```

* With a Docker deployment, deprovisioning tears down the Docker containers, network, and other local configuration. 
* With an AWS deployment, it will remove the EC2 instances, VPC configuration and other associated resources. Note that it will leave the S3 bucket it create; this will have to be manually removed.
