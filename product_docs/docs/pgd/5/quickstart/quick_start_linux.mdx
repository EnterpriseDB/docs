## Introducing TPA and PGD

We created TPA to make installing and managing various Postgres configurations easily repeatable. TPA orchestrates creating and deploying Postgres. In this quick start, you install TPA first. If you already have TPA installed, you can skip those steps. You can use TPA to deploy various configurations of Postgres clusters.

PGD is a multi-master replicating implementation of Postgres designed for high performance and availability. The installation of PGD is orchestrated by TPA. You will use TPA to generate a configuration file for a PGD demonstration cluster. 

The TPA Linux host option allows users of any cloud or VM platform to use TPA to configure EDB Postgres Distributed. All you need from TPA is for the target system to be configured with a Linux operating system and accessible using SSH. Unlike the other TPA platforms (Docker and AWS), the Linux host configuration doesn't provision the target machines. It's up to you to provision them wherever you decide to deploy.

This cluster uses Linux server instances to host the cluster's nodes. The nodes include three replicating database nodes, three cohosted connection proxies, and one backup node. TPA can then provision, prepare, and deploy the required EDB Postgres Distributed software and configuration to each node.

!!! Note On host compatibility
This set of steps is specifically for users running Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on Intel/AMD processors.
!!!

## Prerequisites

### Configure your Linux hosts

You will need to provision four hosts for this quick start. Each host should have a [supported Linux operating system](/tpa/latest/reference/distributions/) installed. To eliminate prompts for password, each host also needs to be SSH-accessible using certificate key pairs.

!!! Note On machine provisioning
Azure users can follow [a Microsoft guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal?tabs=ubuntu) on how to provision Azure VMs loaded with Linux. Google Cloud Platform users can follow [a Google guide](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/create-linux-vm-instance) on how to provision GCP VMs with Linux loaded. You can use any virtual machine technology to host a Linux instance, too. Refer to your virtualization platform's documentation for instructions on how to create instances with Linux loaded on them.

Whichever cloud or VM platform you use, you need to make sure that each instance is accessible by SSH and that each instance can connect to the other instances. They can connect through either the public network or over a VPC for the cloud platforms. You can connect through your local network for on-premises VMs.

If you can't do this, you might want to consider the Docker or AWS quick start. These configurations are easier to set up and quicker to tear down. The [AWS quick start](quick_start_aws), for example, automatically provisions compute instances and creates a VPC for those instances.
!!!

In this quick start, you will install PGD nodes onto four hosts configured in the cloud. Each of these hosts in this example is installed with Rocky Linux. Each has a public IP address to go with its private IP address.

| Host name   | Public IP                | Private IP     |
| ----------- | ------------------------ | -------------- |
| linuxhost-1 | 172.19.16.27 | 192.168.2.247 |
| linuxhost-2 | 172.19.16.26 | 192.168.2.41   |
| linuxhost-3 | 172.19.16.25 | 192.168.2.254 |
| linuxhost-4 |172.19.16.15 | 192.168.2.30 |

These are example IP addresses. Substitute them with your own public and private IP addresses as you progress through the quick start.

###  Set up a host admin user

Each machine requires a user account to use for installation. For simplicity, use a user with the same name on all the hosts. On each host, also configure the user so that you can SSH into the host without being prompted for a password. Be sure to give that user sudo privileges on the host. On the four hosts, the user rocky is already configured with sudo privileges.

## Preparation

### EDB account

You'll need an EDB account to install both TPA and PGD.

[Sign up for a free EDB account](https://www.enterprisedb.com/accounts/register) if you don't already have one. Signing up gives you a trial subscription to EDB's software repositories.

After you are registered, go to the [EDB Repos 2.0](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) page, where you can obtain your repo token. 

On your first visit to this page, select **Request Access** to generate your repo token. Copy the token using the **Copy Token** icon, and store it safely. 


### Setting environment variables

First, set the `EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN` environment variable to the value of your EDB repo token, obtained in the [EDB account](#edb-account) step.

```
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=<your-repo-token>
```

You can add this to your `.bashrc` script or similar shell profile to ensure it's always set.

### Configure the repository

All the software needed for this example is available from the Postgres Distributed package repository. Download and run a script to configure the Postgres Distributed repository. This repository also contains the TPA packages.

```
curl -1sLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/postgres_distributed/setup.deb.sh" | sudo -E bash
```
## Installing Trusted Postgres Architect (TPA)

You'll use TPA to provision and deploy PGD. If you previously installed TPA, you can move on to the [next step](#installing-pgd-using-tpa). You'll find full instructions for installing TPA in the [Trusted Postgres Architect documentation](/tpa/latest/INSTALL/), which we've also included here.

### Linux environment

[TPA supports several distributions of Linux](/tpa/latest/INSTALL/) as a host platform. These examples are written for Ubuntu 22.04, but steps are similar for other supported platforms.

### Install the TPA package

```shell
sudo apt install tpaexec
```

### Configuring TPA

You now need to configure TPA, which configures TPA's Python environment. Call `tpaexec` with the command `setup`:

```shell
sudo /opt/EDB/TPA/bin/tpaexec setup
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/EDB/TPA/bin
```

You can add the `export` command to your shell's profile.

### Testing the TPA installation

You can verify TPA is correctly installed by running `selftest`:

```shell
tpaexec selftest
```
TPA is now installed.

## Installing PGD using TPA

### Generating a configuration file

Run the [`tpaexec configure`](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-configure/) command to generate a configuration folder: 

```
tpaexec configure democluster --architecture PGD-Always-ON --platform bare --edb-postgres-advanced 15 --redwood --no-git --location-names dc1 --pgd-proxy-routing global --hostnames-unsorted
```

You specify the PGD-Always-ON architecture (`--architecture PGD-Always-ON`), which sets up the configuration for [PGD 5's Always On architectures](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/architectures/). As part of the default architecture, it configures your cluster with three data nodes, cohosting three [PGD Proxy](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/routing/proxy/) servers and a [Barman](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/backup/#physical-backup) node for backup.

For Linux hosts, specify that you're targeting a "bare" platform (`--platform bare`). TPA will determine the Linux version running on each host during deployment. See [the EDB Postgres Distributed compatibility table](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility) for details about the supported operating systems.

Specify that the data nodes will be running [EDB Postgres Advanced Server v15](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/epas/latest/) (`--edb-postgres-advanced 15`) with Oracle compatibility (`--redwood`).

You set the notional location of the nodes to `dc1` using `--location-names`. You then set `--pgd-proxy-routing` to `global` so that proxy routing can route traffic to all nodes in the cluster.

By default, TPA commits configuration changes to a Git repository. For this example, you don't need to do that, so pass the `--no-git` flag.

Finally, you ask TPA to generate repeatable hostnames for the nodes by passing `--hostnames-unsorted`. Otherwise, it selects hostnames at random from a predefined list of suitable words.

This command creates a subdirectory in the current working directory called `democluster`. It contains the `config.yml` configuration file TPA uses to create the cluster. You can view it using:

```shell
less democluster/config.yml
```

You now need to edit the configuration file to add details related to your Linux hosts, such as admin user names and public and private IP addresses.

## Editing your configuration

Using your preferred editor, open `democluster/config.yml`.

Search for the line containing `ansible_user: root`. Change `root` to the name of the user you configured with SSH access and sudo privileges. Follow that with this line:

```yaml
    manage_ssh_hostkeys: yes
```

Your `instance_defaults` section now looks like this:

```yaml
instance_defaults:
  platform: bare
  vars:
    ansible_user: rocky
    manage_ssh_hostkeys: yes
```
Next, search for `node: 1`, which is the configuration settings of the first node, kaboom.  

After the `node: 1` line, add the public and private IP addresses of your node. Use `linuxhost-1` as the host for this node. Add the following to the file, substituting your IP addresses. Align the start of each line with the start of the `node:` line. 

```yaml
  public_ip: 172.19.16.27
  private_ip: 192.168.2.247
```

The whole entry for kaboom looks like this but with your own IP addresses:

```yaml
- Name: kaboom
  backup: kapok
  location: dc1
  node: 1
  public_ip: 172.19.16.27
  private_ip: 192.168.2.247 
  role:
  - bdr
  - pgd-proxy
  vars:
    bdr_child_group: dc1_subgroup
    bdr_node_options:
      route_priority: 100
```
Repeat this process for the three other nodes.

Search for `node: 2`, which is the configuration settings for the node kaftan. Use `linuxhost-2` for this node. Substituting your IP addresses, add:

```yaml
  public_ip: 172.19.16.26
  private_ip: 192.168.2.41
```

Search for `node: 3`, which is the configuration settings for the node kaolin. Use `linuxhost-3` for this node. Substituting your IP addresses, add:

```yaml
  public_ip: 172.19.16.25
  private_ip: 192.168.2.254
```

Finally, search for `node: 4`, which is the configuration settings for the node kapok. Use `linuxhost-4` for this node. Substituting your IP addresses, add:

```yaml
  public_ip: 172.19.16.15
  private_ip: 192.168.2.30
```

## Provisioning the cluster

You can now run:

```
tpaexec provision democluster
```

This command prepares for deploying the cluster. (On other platforms, such as Docker and AWS, this command also creates the required hosts. When using Linux hosts, your hosts should already be configured.)

!!! SeeAlso "Further reading"
    - [`tpaexec provision`](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-provision/) in the Trusted Postgres Architect documentation


One part of this process for Linux hosts is creating key-pairs for the hosts for SSH operations later. With those key-pairs created, you will need to copy the public part of the key-pair to the hosts. You can do this with `ssh-copy-id`, giving the democluster identity (`-i`) and the login to each host. For this example, these are the commands:

```shell
ssh-copy-id -i democluster/id_democluster rocky@172.19.16.27
ssh-copy-id -i democluster/id_democluster rocky@172.19.16.26
ssh-copy-id -i democluster/id_democluster rocky@172.19.16.25
ssh-copy-id -i democluster/id_democluster rocky@172.19.16.15
```


You can now create the `tpa_known_hosts` file, which allows the hosts to be verified. Use `ssh-keyscan` on each host (`-H`) and append its output to `tpa_known_hosts`:

```shell
ssh-keyscan -H 172.19.16.27 >> democluster/tpa_known_hosts
ssh-keyscan -H 172.19.16.26 >> democluster/tpa_known_hosts
ssh-keyscan -H 172.19.16.25 >> democluster/tpa_known_hosts
ssh-keyscan -H 172.19.16.15 >> democluster/tpa_known_hosts
```

## Deploy your cluster

You now have everything ready to deploy your cluster. To deploy, run:

```shell
tpaexec deploy democluster
```

TPA applies the configuration, installing the needed packages and setting up the actual EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

!!! SeeAlso "Further reading"
    - [`tpaexec deploy`](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-deploy/) in the Trusted Postgres Architect documentation

## Connecting to the cluster

You're now ready to log into one of the nodes of the cluster with SSH and then connect to the database. Part of the configuration process set up SSH logins for all the nodes, complete with keys. To use the SSH configuration, you need to be in the `democluster` directory created by the `tpaexec configure` command earlier:

```shell
cd democluster
```

From there, you can run `ssh -F ssh_config <hostname>` to establish an SSH connection. Connect to kaboom, the first database node in the cluster:

```shell
ssh -F ssh_config kaboom
__OUTPUT__
[rocky@kaboom ~]# 
```

Notice that you're logged in as rocky, the admin user and ansible user you configured earlier, on kaboom.

You now need to adopt the identity of the enterprisedb user. This user is preconfigured and authorized to connect to the cluster's nodes.

```shell
sudo -iu enterprisedb
__OUTPUT__
[root@kaboom ~]# sudo -iu enterprisedb
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $
```

You can now run the `psql` command to access the `bdrdb` database:

```shell
psql bdrdb
__OUTPUT__
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $ psql bdrdb
psql (15.2.0, server 15.2.0)
Type "help" for help.

bdrdb=#
```

You're directly connected to the Postgres database running on the kaboom node and can start issuing SQL commands.

To leave the SQL client, enter `exit`.

### Using PGD CLI

The `pgd` utility, also known as the PGD CLI, lets you control and manage your Postgres Distributed cluster. It's already installed on the node. 

You can use it to check the cluster's health by running `pgd check-health`:

```console
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $ pgd check-health
__OUTPUT__
Check      Status Message
-----      ------ -------
ClockSkew  Ok     All BDR node pairs have clockskew within permissible limit
Connection Ok     All BDR nodes are accessible
Raft       Ok     Raft Consensus is working correctly
Replslots  Ok     All BDR replication slots are working correctly
Version    Ok     All nodes are running same BDR versions
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $
```

Or, you can use `pgd show-nodes` to ask PGD to show you the data-bearing nodes in the cluster:

```console
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $ pgd show-nodes
__OUTPUT__
Node   Node ID    Group        Type Current State Target State Status Seq ID
----   -------    -----        ---- ------------- ------------ ------ ------
kaboom 2710197610 dc1_subgroup data ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     1
kaftan 3490219809 dc1_subgroup data ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     3
kaolin 2111777360 dc1_subgroup data ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     2
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $
```

Similarly, use `pgd show-proxies` to display the proxy connection nodes:

```console
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $ pgd show-proxies
__OUTPUT__
Proxy  Group        Listen Addresses Listen Port
-----  -----        ---------------- -----------
kaboom dc1_subgroup [0.0.0.0]        6432
kaftan dc1_subgroup [0.0.0.0]        6432
kaolin dc1_subgroup [0.0.0.0]        6432
```

The proxies provide high-availability connections to the cluster of data nodes for applications. You can connect to the proxies and, in turn, to the database with the command `psql -h kaboom,kaftan,kaolin -p 6432 bdrdb`:

```console
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $ psql -h kaboom,kaftan,kaolin -p 6432 bdrdb
__OUTPUT__
psql (15.2.0, server 15.2.0)
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

bdrdb=#
```
