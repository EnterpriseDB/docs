This quick start sets up EDB Postgres Distributed with an Always On Single Location architecture using Amazon EC2.

## Introducing TPA and PGD

We created TPA to make installing and managing various Postgres configurations easily repeatable. TPA orchestrates creating and deploying Postgres. In this quick start, you install TPA first. If you already have TPA installed, you can skip those steps. You can use TPA to deploy various configurations of Postgres clusters.

PGD is a multi-master replicating implementation of Postgres designed for high performance and availability. The installation of PGD is orchestrated by TPA. You will use TPA to generate a configuration file for a PGD demonstration cluster. This cluster uses Amazon EC2 instances to host the cluster's nodes: three replicating database nodes, two connection proxies, and one backup node. You can then use TPA to provision and deploy the required configuration and software to each node.

## Preparation

!!! Note
This set of steps is specifically for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on Intel/AMD processors.  
!!!

### EDB account

To install both TPA and PGD, you need an EDB account. 

[Sign up for a free EDB account](https://www.enterprisedb.com/accounts/register) if you don't already have one. Signing up gives you a trial subscription to EDB's software repositories. 

After you are registered, go to the [EDB Repos 2.0](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) page, where you can obtain your repo token. 

On your first visit to this page, select **Request Access** to generate your repo token. Copy the token using the **Copy Token** icon, and store it safely. 

### Install curl

You use the `curl` command to retrieve installation scripts from repositories. On Ubuntu, curl isn't installed by default. To see if it's present, run `curl` in the terminal:

```console
$ curl
Command 'curl' not found, but can be installed with:
sudo apt install curl
```

If not found, run:

```
sudo apt -y install curl
```

### Setting environment variables

First, set the `EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN` environment variable to the value of your EDB repo token, obtained in the [EDB account](#edb-account) step.

```shell
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=<your-repo-token>
```

You can add this to your `.bashrc` script or similar shell profile to ensure it's always set.

### Configure the repository

All the software needed for this example is available from the Postgres Distributed package repository. Download and run a script to configure the Postgres Distributed repository. This repository also contains the TPA packages.

```shell
curl -1sLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/postgres_distributed/setup.deb.sh" | sudo -E bash
``` 

!!! Tip "Troubleshooting repo access"
    The script should produce output starting with:
    ```text
    Executing the  setup script for the 'enterprisedb/postgres_distributed' repository ...
    ```
    If it produces no output or an error, double-check that you entered your token correctly. If the problem persists, [contact Support](https://support.enterprisedb.com) for assistance.

## Installing Trusted Postgres Architect (TPA)

You'll use TPA to provision and deploy PGD. If you previously installed TPA, you can move on to the [next step](#installing-pgd-using-tpa). You'll find full instructions for installing TPA in the [Trusted Postgres Architect documentation](/tpa/latest/INSTALL/), which we've also included here.

### Linux environment

[TPA supports several distributions of Linux](/tpa/latest/INSTALL/) as a host platform. These examples are written for Ubuntu 22.04, but steps are similar for other supported platforms.

### Install the TPA package

```shell
sudo apt install tpaexec
```

### Configuring TPA

You need to configure TPA, which configures TPA's Python environment. Call `tpaexec` with the command `setup`:

```shell
sudo /opt/EDB/TPA/bin/tpaexec setup
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/EDB/TPA/bin
```

You can add the `export` command to your shell's profile.

### Testing the TPA installation

You can verify TPA is correctly installed by running `selftest`:

```shell
tpaexec selftest
```
TPA is now installed.

### AWS CLI

TPA uses the AWS CLI to provision and deploy. [Install the CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html), and then [configure credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) for an IAM user with sufficient access rights. [TPA AWS platform](/tpa/latest/platform-aws/) details the permissions that you'll need.



## Installing PGD using TPA

### Generating a configuration file

Run the [`tpaexec configure`](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-configure/) command to generate a configuration folder: 

```shell-session
tpaexec configure democluster \
  --architecture PGD-Always-ON \
  --platform aws \
  --region eu-west-1 \
  --edb-postgres-advanced 15 \
  --redwood \
  --location-names dc1 \
  --active-locations dc1 \
  --no-git \
  --hostnames-unsorted
```

You specify the PGD-Always-ON architecture (`--architecture PGD-Always-ON`), which sets up the configuration for [PGD 5's Always On architectures](/pgd/latest/architectures/). As part of the default architecture, 
this configures your cluster with three data nodes, cohosting three [PGD Proxy](../routing/proxy/) servers, along with a [Barman](../backup#physical-backup) node for backup.

Specify that you're using AWS (`--platform aws`) and eu-west-1 as the region (`--region eu-west-1`). 

TPA defaults to t3.micro instances on AWS. This is enough for this demonstration and also suitable for use with an [AWS free tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) account.

!!! Warning AWS free tier limitations
    AWS free tier limitations for EC2 are based on hours of instance usage. Depending on how much time you spend testing, you might exceed these limits and incur charges. 

By default, TPA configures Debian as the default OS for all nodes on AWS. 

!!! Note Deployment platforms
    Other Linux platforms are supported as deployment targets for PGD. See [the EDB Postgres Distributed compatibility table](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility) for details.

    Observe that you don't have to deploy PGD to the same platform you're using to run TPA!

Specify that the data nodes will be running [EDB Postgres Advanced Server v15](/epas/latest/) (`--edb-postgres-advanced 15`) with Oracle compatibility (`--redwood`). 

You set the notional location of the nodes to `dc1` using `--location-names`. You then activate the PGD proxies in that location using `--active-locations dc1` set to the same location.

By default, TPA commits configuration changes to a Git repository. For this example, you don't need to do that, so you pass the `--no-git` flag.

Finally, you ask TPA to generate repeatable hostnames for the nodes by passing `--hostnames-unsorted`. Otherwise, it selects hostnames at random from a predefined list of suitable words.

This command creates a subdirectory in the current working directory called `democluster`. It contains the `config.yml` configuration file TPA uses to create the cluster. You can view it using:

```shell
less democluster/config.yml
```

    - View the full set of available options by running:
      ```shell
      tpaexec configure --architecture PGD-Always-ON --help
      ``` 
    - More details on PGD-Always-ON configuration options in [Deploying with TPA](../tpa)
    - [PGD-Always-ON](/tpa/latest/architecture-PGD-Always-ON/) in the Trusted Postgres Architect documentation
    - [`tpaexec configure`](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-configure/) in the Trusted Postgres Architect documentation
    - [AWS platform](/tpa/latest/platform-aws/) in the Trusted Postgres Architect documentation

## Provisioning the cluster:
   
Next, allocate the resources needed to run the configuration you just created using the [`tpaexec provision`](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-provision/) command:
   
```shell
tpaexec provision democluster
```

Since you specified AWS as the platform (the default platform), TPA provisions EC2 instances, VPCs, subnets, routing tables, internet gateways, security groups, EBS volumes, elastic IPs, and so on.

Because you didn't specify an existing one when configuring, TPA also prompts you to confirm the creation of an S3 bucket.

!!! Warning Remember to remove the bucket when you're done testing!
    TPA doesn't remove the bucket that it creates in this step when you later deprovision the cluster. Take note of the name now, so that you can be sure to remove it later.

!!! SeeAlso "Further reading"
    - [`tpaexec provision`](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-provision/) in the Trusted Postgres Architect documentation

## Deploying the cluster 

With configuration in place and infrastructure provisioned, you can now [deploy](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-deploy/) the distributed cluster:

```shell
tpaexec deploy democluster
```

TPA applies the configuration, installing the needed packages and setting up the actual EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

!!! SeeAlso "Further reading"
    - [`tpaexec deploy`](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-deploy/) in the Trusted Postgres Architect documentation

## Connecting to the cluster

You're now ready to log into one of the nodes of the cluster with SSH and then connect to the database. Part of the configuration process set up SSH logins for all the nodes, complete with keys. To use the SSH configuration, you need to be in the `democluster` directory created by the `tpaexec configure` command earlier:

```shell
cd democluster
```

From there, you can run `ssh -F ssh_config <hostname>` to establish an SSH connection. You will connect to kaboom, the first database node in the cluster:

```shell
ssh -F ssh_config kaboom
__OUTPUT__
[admin@kaboom ~]# 
```

Notice that you're logged in as admin on kaboom.

You now need to adopt the identity of the enterprisedb user. This user is preconfigured and authorized to connect to the cluster's nodes.

```shell
sudo -iu enterprisedb
__OUTPUT__
[admin@kaboom ~]# sudo -iu enterprisedb
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $
```

You can now run the `psql` command to access the bdrdb database:

```shell
psql bdrdb
__OUTPUT__
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $ psql bdrdb
psql (15.2.0, server 15.2.0)
Type "help" for help.

bdrdb=#
```

You're directly connected to the Postgres database running on the kaboom node and can start issuing SQL commands.

To leave the SQL client, enter `exit`.

### Using PGD CLI

The pgd utility, also known as the PGD CLI, lets you control and manage your Postgres Distributed cluster. It's already installed on the node. 

You can use it to check the cluster's health by running `pgd check-health`:

```console
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $ pgd check-health
Check      Status Message
-----      ------ -------
ClockSkew  Ok     All BDR node pairs have clockskew within permissible limit
Connection Ok     All BDR nodes are accessible
Raft       Ok     Raft Consensus is working correctly
Replslots  Ok     All BDR replication slots are working correctly
Version    Ok     All nodes are running same BDR versions
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $
```

Or, you can use `pgd show-nodes` to ask PGD to show you the data-bearing nodes in the cluster:

```console
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $ pgd show-nodes
Node   Node ID    Group        Type Current State Target State Status Seq ID
----   -------    -----        ---- ------------- ------------ ------ ------
kaboom 2710197610 dc1_subgroup data ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     1
kaftan 3490219809 dc1_subgroup data ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     3
kaolin 2111777360 dc1_subgroup data ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     2
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $
```

Similarly, use `pgd show-proxies` to display the proxy connection nodes:

```console
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $ pgd show-proxies
Proxy  Group        Listen Addresses Listen Port
-----  -----        ---------------- -----------
kaboom dc1_subgroup [0.0.0.0]        6432
kaftan dc1_subgroup [0.0.0.0]        6432
kaolin dc1_subgroup [0.0.0.0]        6432
```

The proxies provide high-availability connections to the cluster of data nodes for applications. You can connect to the proxies and, in turn, to the database with the command `psql -h kapok,kaput -p 6432 bdrdb`:

```
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $ psql -h kaboom,kaftan,kaolin -p 6432 bdrdb
psql (15.2.0, server 15.2.0)
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

bdrdb=#
```
