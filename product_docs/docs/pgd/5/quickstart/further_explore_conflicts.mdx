  An exploration of how PGD handles conflicts between data nodes

## Conflicts

When one database node has an update from an application to a row and another node has a different update to the same row, there will be a conflict between the two nodes. Resolving that conflict is core to how Postgres Distributed maintains consistency. To see how it works, you need to open a command line view of all the servers. You can then create and monitor conflicts to better understand them.

### Installing xpanes

You will be using xpanes, a utility which allows you to quickly create multiple terminal sessions which you can quickly switch between. Start by connecting to the "kaboom" node with ssh.

```shell
cd democluster && ssh -F ssh_config kaboom
```

We then install xpanes

```shell
dnf -y install xpanes
```

### Connecting to four servers

You need to be logged in as the enterprisedb user to allow authentication to work:

```shell
sudo -iu enterprisedb
```

 Then run the following command to connect to three database servers and a proxy server:

```shell
xpanes -d -c "psql postgresql://enterprisedb@{}/bdrdb?sslmode=require" "kaboom:5444" "kaftan:5444" "kaolin:5444" "kapok:6432"
```

xpanes takes the command after `-c` and substitutes in the values in the arguments that follow to create a command to run. That means that when run, there will be four panes. Three panes will be connected to kaboom, kaftan and kaolin on port 5444 - the database nodes - and one will be connected to the pgd-proxy node kapok on port 6432. Each one will be logged into the database as `enterprisedb`.

Typing Control-b followed by q will briefly display the numeric values for each pane.

To switch the focus between the panes, type control-b followed by q and the number of the pane you want to focus on. Use control-b q 3 to move the focus to the bottom right pane.
