## Deploying on Azure and Google clouds

For most cloud platforms such as Azure and Google Cloud Platform, you will need to create Linux hosts on the cloud platform you are using. You can then use the [Deploying on Linux hosts](quick_start_linux) quick start to deploy PGD to those Linux hosts. 

* Azure users can follow [a Microsoft guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal?tabs=ubuntu) on how to provision Azure VMs loaded with Linux. 
* Google Cloud Platform users can follow [a Google guide](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/create-linux-vm-instance) on how to provision GCP VMs with Linux loaded. 

Now continue with [Deploying on Linux hosts](quick_start_linux)

* AWS users should go to the [Deploying on AWS](quick_start_aws) quick start where TPA will
automatically provision the hosts needed to create your cluster.
