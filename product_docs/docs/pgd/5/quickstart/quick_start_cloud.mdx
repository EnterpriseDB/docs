## Deploying on cloud platforms

For most cloud platforms, excluding AWS, TPA needs you to create Linux hosts on the cloud platform you are using and use the [Deploying on Linux hosts](quick_start_linux) quick start.

Azure users can follow [a Microsoft guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal?tabs=ubuntu) on how to provision Azure VMs loaded with Linux. Google Cloud Platform users can follow [a Google guide](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/create-linux-vm-instance) on how to provision GCP VMs with Linux loaded. 

AWS users should go to the [Deploying on AWS](quick_start_aws) quick start where TPA will
automatically provision the hosts needed to create your cluster.
