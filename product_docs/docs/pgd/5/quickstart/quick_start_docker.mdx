The following steps use Trusted Postgres Architect (TPA) to set up EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) with an Always On Single Location architecture using local Docker containers.

## Introducing TPA and PGD

We created TPA to make the installation and management of various Postgres configurations easily repeatable. TPA orchestrates the creation and deployment of Postgres. In this quick start, we install TPA first. If you already have TPA installed, you can skip those steps. TPA can be used, and re-used, to deploy various configurations of Postgres clusters.

PGD is a multi-master replicating implementation of Postgres designed for high performance and availability. The installation of PGD is orchestrated by TPA. We will get TPA to generate a configuration file for a PGD demonstration cluster. This cluster uses local Docker containers to host the cluster's nodes: three replicating database nodes, two connection proxies and one backup node. We can then use TPA to provision and deploy the required configuration and software to each node.

This configuration of PGD is not suitable for production use, but can be valuable for testing the functionality and behavior of PGD clusters. You may also find it useful when familiarizing yourself with PGD commands and APIs in preparation for deployment on cloud, VM, or bare-metal platforms. 

!!! Note
This set of steps is specifically for Ubuntu 22.04 LTS on Intel/AMD processors.  
!!!

## Prerequisites

To complete this example, you need free storage and Docker installed. 

### Free disk space

You need at least 5GB of free storage (accessible by Docker) to deploy the cluster described by this example. A bit more is probably wise.

### Docker Engine

We use Docker containers as the target platform for this PGD deployment.

```shell
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
```

!!! Important Running as a non-root user
    Be sure to add your user to the Docker group once installed:

    ```shell
    sudo usermod -aG docker <username>
    newgrp docker
    ```

## Preparation

### EDB account

You'll need an EDB account in order to install both TPA *and* PGD. 

[Sign up for a free EDB account](https://www.enterprisedb.com/accounts/register) if you don't already have one - this gives you a trial subscription to EDB's software repositories. 

Once you have registered, or if you are already registered, go to the [EDB Repos 2.0](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) page where you can obtain your "repo token". 

On your first visit to this page you have to select **Request Access** to generate your "repo token". Copy the token using the Copy Token icon and store it safely. 

### Setting environment variables

First, set the `EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN` environment variable to the value of your EDB repo token, obtained in the previous [EDB Account](#edb-account) step.

```shell
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=<your-repo-token>
```

This can be added to your `.bashrc` script (or similar shell profile) to ensure it is always set.

### Configure the repository

All the software needed for this example is available from the Postgres Distributed package repository. We download and run a script to configure the Postgres Distributed repository. This repository also contains the TPA packages.

```shell
curl -1sLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/postgres_distributed/setup.deb.sh" | sudo -E bash
``` 

!!! Tip "Troubleshooting repo access"
    The command above should produce output starting with,
    ```text
    Executing the  setup script for the 'enterprisedb/postgres_distributed' repository ...
    ```
    If it produces no output or an error, double-check that you entered your token correctly. It the problem persists, [contact Support](https://support.enterprisedb.com) for assistance.

## Installing Trusted Postgres Architect (TPA)

We are using TPA to provision and deploy PGD. If you have previously installed TPA, you can move on to the [next step](#installing-pgd-using-tpa). You'll find full instructions for installing TPA in the [Trusted Postgres Architect documentation](/tpa/latest/INSTALL/), which we've included here for convenience:

### Linux environment

[TPA supports several distributions of Linux](/tpa/latest/INSTALL/) as a host platform. These examples are written for Ubuntu 22.04, but steps are similar for other supported platforms.

!!! Important
    If the Linux host platform you are using is running [cgroups](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cgroups) v2, you'll need to disable it and enable cgroups v1 while using TPA to deploy to Docker. 
    
    To check for cgroup v2:

    ```shell
    mount | grep cgroup | head -1
    ```

    You'll need to disable cgroup v2 if the output is:
    ```text
    cgroup on /sys/fs/cgroup type cgroup2
    ```

    To disable cgroup v2:

    ```shell
    echo 'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX=systemd.unified_cgroup_hierarchy=false' | sudo tee \
      /etc/default/grub.d/cgroup.cfg
    sudo update-grub
    sudo reboot    
    ```


### Install the TPA package

```shell
sudo apt install tpaexec
```

### Configuring TPA

We now need to configure TPA which configures TPA's Python environment. Just call `tpaexec` with the command `setup`.

```shell
sudo /opt/EDB/TPA/bin/tpaexec setup
export PATH=$PATH:/opt/EDB/TPA/bin
```

You can add the export command to your shell's profile.

### Testing the TPA installation

You can verify TPA is correctly installed by running `selftest`.

```shell
tpaexec selftest
```
TPA is now installed.

## Installing PGD using TPA

### Generating a configuration file

Run the [`tpaexec configure`](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-configure/) command to generate a configuration folder. 

```shell-session
tpaexec configure democluster \
  --architecture PGD-Always-ON \
  --platform docker \
  --edb-postgres-advanced 15 \
  --redwood \
  --location-names dc1 \
  --active-locations dc1 \
  --no-git \
  --hostnames-unsorted
```

We specify the PGD-Always-ON architecture (`--architecture PGD-Always-ON`): this
sets up the configuration for [PGD 5's Always On
architectures](../architectures/). As part of the default architecture,
it configures our cluster with three data nodes, co-hosting three [PGD
Proxy](../routing/proxy/) servers, along with a [Barman](../backup#physical-backup)
node for backup.

We specify using Docker (`--platform docker`). By default, TPA configures Rocky
Linux as the default image for all nodes.

!!! Note Deployment platforms
    Numerous other Linux platforms are supported as deployment targets for PGD - view [the EDB Postgres Distributed compatibility table](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility) for details.

    Observe that we don't have to deploy PGD to the same platform we're using to run TPA!

We specify that the data nodes will be running [EDB Postgres Advanced Server v15](/epas/latest/) (`--edb-postgres-advanced 15`) with Oracle compatibility (`--redwood`). 

We set the notional location of the nodes to `dc1` using `--location-names`. We then activate the PGD proxies in that location using `--active-locations dc1` set to the same location.

By default, TPA commits configuration changes to a Git repository. For this example, we don't need to do that so we pass the `--no-git` flag.

Finally, we ask TPA to generate repeatable hostnames for the nodes by passing `--hostnames-unsorted` otherwise it will select hostnames at random from a predefined list of suitable words.

This creates a subdirectory in the current working directory called `democluster` containing the `config.yml` configuration file TPA uses to create the cluster. You can view it using:

```shell
less democluster/config.yml
```

    - View the full set of available options by running,
      ```shell
      tpaexec configure --architecture PGD-Always-ON --help
      ``` 
    - More details on PGD-Always-ON configuration options in [Deploying with TPA](../tpa)

    - [`tpaexec configure`](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-configure/) in the Trusted Postgres Architect documentation
    - [Docker platform](/tpa/latest/platform-docker/) in the Trusted Postgres Architect documentation

### Provisioning the cluster

Now we allocate the resources needed to run the configuration we have just created, using the [`tpaexec provision`](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-provision/) command.
   
```shell
tpaexec provision democluster
```

Since we specified Docker as the platform, TPA creates a Docker image, containers, networks, and so on.

!!! SeeAlso "Further reading"
    - [`tpaexec provision`](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-provision/) in the Trusted Postgres Architect documentation

### Deploying the cluster

With configuration in place and infrastructure provisioned, we can now [deploy](/tpa/latest/tpaexec-deploy/) the distributed cluster.

```shell
tpaexec deploy democluster
```

TPA applies the configuration, installing the needed packages and setting up the actual EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

## Connecting to the cluster

You are now ready to log into one of the nodes of the cluster with SSH and then connect to the database. Part of the configuration process set up SSH logins for all the nodes complete with keys. To use the SSH configuration, you will need to be in the `democluster` directory created by the `tpaexec configure` command earlier.

```shell
cd democluster
```

From there you can run `ssh -F ssh_config <hostname>` to establish an SSH connection. We will connect to `kaboom`, the first database node in the cluster:

```shell
ssh -F ssh_config kaboom
__OUTPUT__
[root@kaboom ~]# 
```

You will see that you are logged in as `root` on `kaboom`.

You will now need to adopt the identity of the `enterprisedb` user. This user is pre-configured and authorized to connect to the cluster's nodes.

```shell
sudo -iu enterprisedb
__OUTPUT__
[root@kaboom ~]# sudo -iu enterprisedb
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $
```

You can now run the `psql` command to access the `bdrdb` database:

```shell
psql bdrdb
__OUTPUT__
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $ psql bdrdb
psql (15.2.0, server 15.2.0)
Type "help" for help.

bdrdb=#
```

You are now directly connected to the Postgres database running on the `kaboom` node and can start issuing SQL commands.

Type `exit` to leave the SQL client.

### Using PGD CLI

The `pgd` utility, also known as the PGD CLI will let you control and manage your Postgres Distributed cluster. It is already installed on the node. 

You can use it to check the cluster's health by running `pgd check-health`:

```console
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $ pgd check-health
Check      Status Message
-----      ------ -------
ClockSkew  Ok     All BDR node pairs have clockskew within permissible limit
Connection Ok     All BDR nodes are accessible
Raft       Ok     Raft Consensus is working correctly
Replslots  Ok     All BDR replication slots are working correctly
Version    Ok     All nodes are running same BDR versions
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $
```

Or you can ask pgd to show you the data bearing nodes in the cluster with `pgd show-nodes`:

```console
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $ pgd show-nodes
Node   Node ID    Group        Type Current State Target State Status Seq ID
----   -------    -----        ---- ------------- ------------ ------ ------
kaboom 2710197610 dc1_subgroup data ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     1
kaftan 3490219809 dc1_subgroup data ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     3
kaolin 2111777360 dc1_subgroup data ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     2
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $
```

And similarly, display the proxy connection nodes with `pgd show-proxies`:

```console
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $ pgd show-proxies
Proxy  Group        Listen Addresses Listen Port
-----  -----        ---------------- -----------
kaboom dc1_subgroup [0.0.0.0]        6432
kaftan dc1_subgroup [0.0.0.0]        6432
kaolin dc1_subgroup [0.0.0.0]        6432
```

The proxies provide high availability connections to the cluster of data nodes for applications. You can connect to the proxies and in turn to the database with the command `psql -h kapok,kaput -p 6432 bdrdb`.

```
enterprisedb@kaboom:~ $ psql -h kaboom,kaftan,kaolin -p 6432 bdrdb
psql (15.2.0, server 15.2.0)
SSL connection (protocol: TLSv1.3, cipher: TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384, compression: off)
Type "help" for help.

bdrdb=#
```

## Deprovisioning the cluster

When you're done testing the cluster, you'll want to deprovision it. This will tear down the Docker containers, network, and so on:

```shell
tpaexec deprovision democluster
```
