Each database that's member of a PGD group must be represented by its own
node. A node is a unique identifier of a database in a PGD group.

At present, each node can be a member of just one node group. (This might be
extended in later releases.) Each node can subscribe to one or more
replication sets to give fine-grained control over replication.

A PGD group might also contain zero or more subgroups, allowing you to create a variety
of different architectures.

## Creating and joining a PGD group

For PGD, every node must connect to every other node. To make
configuration easy, when a new node joins, it configures all
existing nodes to connect to it. For this reason, every node, including
the first PGD node created, must know the [PostgreSQL connection string](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-connect.html#LIBPQ-CONNSTRING),
sometimes referred to as a data source name (DSN), that other nodes
can use to connect to it. Both formats of connection string are supported.
So you can use either key-value format, like `host=myhost port=5432 dbname=mydb`,
or URI format, like `postgresql://myhost:5432/mydb`.

The SQL function [`bdr.create_node_group()`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrcreate_node_group) creates the PGD group
from the local node. Doing so activates PGD on that node and allows other
nodes to join the PGD group, which consists of only one node at that point.
At the time of creation, you must specify the connection string for other
nodes to use to connect to this node.

Once the node group is created, every further node can join the PGD
group using the [`bdr.join_node_group()`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrjoin_node_group) function.

Alternatively, use the command line utility [bdr_init_physical](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes/#bdr_init_physical) to
create a new node, using `pg_basebackup` (or a physical standby) of an existing
node. If using `pg_basebackup`, the bdr_init_physical utility can optionally
specify the base backup of only the target database. The earlier
behavior was to back up the entire database cluster. With this utility, the activity
completes faster and also uses less space because it excludes
unwanted databases. If you specify only the target database, then the excluded
databases get cleaned up and removed on the new node.

When a new PGD node is joined to an existing PGD group or a node subscribes
to an upstream peer, before replication can begin the system must copy the
existing data from the peer nodes to the local node. This copy must be
carefully coordinated so that the local and remote data starts out
identical. It's not enough to use pg_dump yourself. The BDR
extension provides built-in facilities for making this initial copy.

During the join process, the BDR extension synchronizes existing data
using the provided source node as the basis and creates all metadata
information needed for establishing itself in the mesh topology in the PGD
group. If the connection between the source and the new node disconnects during
this initial copy, restart the join process from the
beginning.

The node that's joining the cluster must not contain any schema or data
that already exists on databases in the PGD group. We recommend that the
newly joining database be empty except for the BDR extension. However,
it's important that all required database users and roles are created.

Optionally, you can skip the schema synchronization using the `synchronize_structure`
parameter of the [`bdr.join_node_group`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrjoin_node_group) function. In this case, the schema must
already exist on the newly joining node.

We recommend that you select the source node that has the best connection (the
closest) as the source node for joining. Doing so lowers the time
needed for the join to finish.

Coordinate the join procedure using the Raft consensus algorithm, which
requires most existing nodes to be online and reachable.

The logical join procedure (which uses the [`bdr.join_node_group`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrjoin_node_group) function)
performs data sync doing `COPY` operations and uses multiple writers
(parallel apply) if those are enabled.

Node join can execute concurrently with other node joins for the majority of
the time taken to join. However, only one regular node at a time can be in
either of the states PROMOTE or PROMOTING, which are typically fairly short if
all other nodes are up and running. Otherwise the join is serialized at
this stage. The subscriber-only nodes are an exception to this rule, and they
can be concurrently in PROMOTE and PROMOTING states as well, so their join
process is fully concurrent.

The join process uses only one node as the source, so it can be
executed when nodes are down if a majority of nodes are available.
This can cause a complexity when running logical join.
During logical join, the commit timestamp of rows copied from the source
node is set to the latest commit timestamp on the source node.
Committed changes on nodes that have a commit timestamp earlier than this
(because nodes are down or have significant lag) can conflict with changes
from other nodes. In this case, the newly joined node can be resolved
differently to other nodes, causing a divergence. As a result, we recommend
not running a node join when significant replication lag exists between nodes.
If this is necessary, run LiveCompare on the newly joined node to
correct any data divergence once all nodes are available and caught up.

`pg_dump` can fail when there is concurrent DDL activity on the source node
because of cache-lookup failures. Since [`bdr.join_node_group`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrjoin_node_group) uses `pg_dump`
internally, it might fail if there's concurrent DDL activity on the source node.
Retrying the join works in that case.

### Joining a heterogeneous cluster

PGD 4.0 node can join a EDB Postgres Distributed cluster running 3.7.x at a specific
minimum maintenance release (such as 3.7.6) or a mix of 3.7 and 4.0 nodes.
This procedure is useful when you want to upgrade not just the PGD
major version but also the underlying PostgreSQL major
version. You can achieve this by joining a 3.7 node running on
PostgreSQL 12 or 13 to a EDB Postgres Distributed cluster running 3.6.x on
PostgreSQL 11. The new node can also
run on the same PostgreSQL major release as all of the nodes in the
existing cluster.

PGD ensures that the replication works correctly in all directions
even when some nodes are running 3.6 on one PostgreSQL major release and
other nodes are running 3.7 on another PostgreSQL major release. But
we recommend that you quickly bring the cluster into a
homogenous state by parting the older nodes once enough new nodes
join the cluster. Don't run any DDLs that might
not be available on the older versions and vice versa.

A node joining with a different major PostgreSQL release can't use
physical backup taken with [`bdr_init_physical`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes#bdr_init_physical), and the node must join
using the logical join method. This is necessary because the major
PostgreSQL releases aren't on-disk compatible with each other.

When a 3.7 node joins the cluster using a 3.6 node as a
source, certain configurations, such as conflict resolution,
aren't copied from the source node. The node must be configured
after it joins the cluster.

### Connection DSNs and SSL (TLS)

The DSN of a node is simply a `libpq` connection string, since nodes connect
using `libpq`. As such, it can contain any permitted `libpq` connection
parameter, including those for SSL. The DSN must work as the
connection string from the client connecting to the node in which it's
specified. An example of such a set of parameters using a client certificate is:

```ini
sslmode=verify-full sslcert=bdr_client.crt sslkey=bdr_client.key
sslrootcert=root.crt
```

With this setup, the files `bdr_client.crt`, `bdr_client.key`, and
`root.crt` must be present in the data directory on each node, with the
appropriate permissions.
For `verify-full` mode, the server's SSL certificate is checked to
ensure that it's directly or indirectly signed with the `root.crt` certificate
authority and that the host name or address used in the connection matches the
contents of the certificate. In the case of a name, this can match a Subject
Alternative Name or, if there are no such names in the certificate, the
Subject's Common Name (CN) field.
Postgres doesn't currently support subject alternative names for IP
addresses, so if the connection is made by address rather than name, it must
match the CN field.

The CN of the client certificate must be the name of the user making the
PGD connection.
This is usually the user postgres. Each node requires matching
lines permitting the connection in the `pg_hba.conf` file. For example:

```ini
hostssl all         postgres 10.1.2.3/24 cert
hostssl replication postgres 10.1.2.3/24 cert
```

Another setup might be to use `SCRAM-SHA-256` passwords instead of client
certificates and not verify the server identity as long as
the certificate is properly signed. Here the DSN parameters might be:

```ini
sslmode=verify-ca sslrootcert=root.crt
```

The corresponding `pg_hba.conf` lines are:

```ini
hostssl all         postgres 10.1.2.3/24 scram-sha-256
hostssl replication postgres 10.1.2.3/24 scram-sha-256
```

In such a scenario, the postgres user needs a `.pgpass` file
containing the correct password.

## Witness nodes

If the cluster has an even number of nodes, it might be useful to create
an extra node to help break ties in the event of a network split (or
network partition, as it is sometimes called).

Rather than create an additional full-size node, you can create a micro node,
sometimes called a witness node. This is a normal PGD node that
is deliberately set up not to replicate any tables or data to it.

## Logical standby nodes

PGD allows you to create a *logical standby node*, also known as an offload
node, a read-only node, receive-only node, or logical-read replicas.
A master node can have zero, one, or more logical standby nodes.

!!! Note
    Logical standby nodes can be used in environments where network traffic
    between data centers is a concern; otherwise having more data nodes per
    location is always preferred.

With a physical standby node, the node never comes up fully, forcing it to
stay in continual recovery mode.
PGD allows something similar. [`bdr.join_node_group`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrjoin_node_group) has the `pause_in_standby`
option to make the node stay in half-way-joined as a logical standby node.
Logical standby nodes receive changes but don't send changes made locally
to other nodes.

Later, if you want, use [`bdr.promote_node`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrpromote_node) to move the logical standby into a
full, normal send/receive node.

A logical standby is sent data by one source node, defined by the DSN in
[`bdr.join_node_group`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrjoin_node_group). Changes from all other nodes are received from this one
source node, minimizing bandwidth between multiple sites.

There are multiple options for high availability:

-   If the source node dies, one physical standby can be promoted to a master.
    In this case, the new master can continue to feed any or all logical standby nodes.

-   If the source node
    dies, one logical standby can be promoted to a full node and replace the source
    in a failover operation similar to single-master operation. If there
    are multiple logical standby nodes, the other nodes can't follow the new master,
    so the effectiveness of this technique is limited to one logical
    standby.

In case a new standby is created from an existing PGD node,
the needed replication slots for operation aren't synced to the
new standby until at least 16 MB of LSN has elapsed since the group
slot was last advanced. In extreme cases, this might require a full
16 MB before slots are synced or created on the streaming replica. If
a failover or switchover occurs during this interval, the
streaming standby can't be promoted to replace its PGD node, as the
group slot and other dependent slots don't exist yet.

The slot sync-up process on the standby solves this by invoking a function
on the upstream. This function moves the group slot in the
entire EDB Postgres Distributed cluster by performing WAL switches and requesting all PGD
peer nodes to replay their progress updates. This causes the
group slot to move ahead in a short time span. This reduces the time
required by the standby for the initial slot's sync-up, allowing for
faster failover to it, if required.

On PostgreSQL, it's important to ensure that the slot's sync-up completes on
the standby before promoting it. You can run the following query on the
standby in the target database to monitor and ensure that the slots
synced up with the upstream. The promotion can go ahead when this query
returns `true`.

```sql
SELECT true FROM pg_catalog.pg_replication_slots WHERE
    slot_type = 'logical' AND confirmed_flush_lsn IS NOT NULL;
```

You can also nudge the slot sync-up process in the entire PGD
cluster by manually performing WAL switches and by requesting all PGD
peer nodes to replay their progress updates. This activity causes
the group slot to move ahead in a short time and also hastens the
slot sync-up activity on the standby. You can run the following queries
on any PGD peer node in the target database for this:

```sql
SELECT bdr.run_on_all_nodes('SELECT pg_catalog.pg_switch_wal()');
SELECT bdr.run_on_all_nodes('SELECT bdr.request_replay_progress_update()');
```

Use the monitoring query on the standby to check that these
queries do help in faster slot sync-up on that standby.

Logical standby nodes can be protected using physical standby nodes,
if desired, so Master->LogicalStandby->PhysicalStandby. You can't
cascade from LogicalStandby to LogicalStandby.

A logical standby does allow write transactions, so the restrictions
of a physical standby don't apply. You can use this to great benefit, since
it allows the logical standby to have additional indexes, longer retention
periods for data, intermediate work tables, LISTEN/NOTIFY, temp tables,
materialized views, and other differences.

Any changes made locally to logical standbys that commit before the promotion
aren't sent to other nodes. All transactions that commit after promotion
are sent onwards. If you perform writes to a logical standby,
take care to quiesce the database before promotion.

You might make DDL changes to logical standby nodes but they aren't
replicated and they don't attempt to take global DDL locks. PGD functions
that act similarly to DDL also aren't replicated. See [DDL replication](ddl).
If you made incompatible DDL changes to a logical standby,
then the database is a *divergent node*. Promotion of a divergent
node currently results in replication failing.
As a result, plan to either ensure that a logical standby node
is kept free of divergent changes if you intend to use it as a standby, or
ensure that divergent nodes are never promoted.

## Physical standby nodes

PGD also enables you to create traditional physical standby failover
nodes. These are commonly intended to directly replace a PGD
node in the cluster after a short promotion procedure. As with
any standard Postgres cluster, a node can have any number of these
physical replicas.

There are, however, some minimal prerequisites for this to work properly
due to the use of replication slots and other functional requirements in
PGD:

-   The connection between PGD primary and standby uses streaming
    replication through a physical replication slot.
-   The standby has:
    -   `recovery.conf` (for PostgreSQL &lt;12, for PostgreSQL 12+ these settings are in `postgres.conf`):
        -   `primary_conninfo` pointing to the primary
        -   `primary_slot_name` naming a physical replication slot on the primary to be used only by this standby
    -   `postgresql.conf`:
        -   `shared_preload_libraries = 'bdr'`, there can be other plugins in the list as well, but don't include pglogical
        -   `hot_standby = on`
        -   `hot_standby_feedback = on`
-   The primary has:
    -   `postgresql.conf`:
        -   [`bdr.standby_slot_names`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrstandby_slot_names) specifies the physical
            replication slot used for the standby's `primary_slot_name`.

While this is enough to produce a working physical standby of a PGD
node, you need to address some additional concerns.

Once established, the standby requires enough time and WAL traffic
to trigger an initial copy of the primary's other PGD-related
replication slots, including the PGD group slot. At minimum, slots on a
standby are live and can survive a failover only if they report
a nonzero `confirmed_flush_lsn` as reported by `pg_replication_slots`.

As a consequence, check physical standby nodes in newly initialized PGD
clusters with low amounts of write activity before
assuming a failover will work normally. Failing to take this precaution
can result in the standby having an incomplete subset of required
replication slots needed to function as a PGD node, and thus an
aborted failover.

The protection mechanism that ensures physical standby nodes are up to date
and can be promoted (as configured by [`bdr.standby_slot_names`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrstandby_slot_names)) affects the
overall replication latency of the PGD group. This is because the group replication
happens only when the physical standby nodes are up to date.

For these reasons, we generally recommend to use either logical standby nodes
or a subscribe-only group instead of physical standby nodes. They both
have better operational characteristics in comparison.

You can can manually ensure the group slot is advanced on all nodes
(as much as possible), which helps hasten the creation of PGD-related
replication slots on a physical standby using the following SQL syntax:

```sql
SELECT bdr.move_group_slot_all_nodes();
```

Upon failover, the standby must perform one of two actions to replace
the primary:

-   Assume control of the same IP address or hostname as the primary.
-   Inform the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster of the change in address by executing the
    [bdr.alter_node_interface](reference/nodes-management-interfaces/#bdralter_node_interface) function on all other PGD nodes.

Once this is done, the other PGD nodes reestablish communication
with the newly promoted standby -> primary node. Since replication
slots are synchronized only periodically, this new primary might reflect
a lower LSN than expected by the existing PGD nodes. If this is the
case, PGD fast forwards each lagging slot to the last location
used by each PGD node.

Take special note of the [`bdr.alter_node_interface`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdralter_node_interface)) parameter as
well. It's important to set it in a EDB Postgres Distributed cluster where there is a
primary -> physical standby relationship or when using subscriber-only groups.

PGD maintains a group slot that always reflects the state of the
cluster node showing the most lag for any outbound replication.
With the addition of a physical
replica, PGD must be informed that there is a nonparticipating node
member that, regardless, affects the state of the group slot.

Since the standby doesn't directly communicate with the other PGD
nodes, the `standby_slot_names` parameter informs PGD to consider named
slots as needed constraints on the group slot as well. When set, the
group slot is held if the standby shows lag, even if the group
slot is normally advanced.

As with any physical replica, this type of standby can also be
configured as a synchronous replica. As a reminder, this requires:

-   On the standby:
    -   Specifying a unique `application_name` in `primary_conninfo`
-   On the primary:
    -   Enabling `synchronous_commit`
    -   Including the standby `application_name` in `synchronous_standby_names`

It's possible to mix physical standby and other PGD nodes in
`synchronous_standby_names`. CAMO and Eager All-Node Replication use
different synchronization mechanisms and don't work with synchronous
replication. Make sure `synchronous_standby_names` doesn't
include any PGD node if either CAMO or Eager All-Node Replication is used.
Instead use only non-PGD nodes, for example, a physical standby.

## Subgroups

A group can also contain zero or more subgroups. Each subgroup can be
allocated to a specific purpose in the top-level parent group. The
node_group_type specifies the type when the subgroup is created.

### Subscriber-only groups

As the name suggests, this type of node
subscribes only to replication changes from other nodes in the cluster. However,
no other nodes receive replication changes from `subscriber-only`
nodes. This is somewhat similar to logical standby nodes. But in contrast
to logical standby, the `subscriber-only` nodes are fully joined to
the cluster. They can receive replication changes from all other nodes
in the cluster and hence aren't affected by unavailability or
parting of any one node in the cluster.

A `subscriber-only` node is a fully joined
PGD node and hence it receives all replicated DDLs and acts on those. It
also uses Raft to consistently report its status to all nodes in the
cluster. The `subscriber-only` node doesn't have Raft voting rights and
hence can't become a Raft leader or participate in the leader
election. Also, while it receives replicated DDLs, it doesn't
participate in DDL or DML lock acquisition. In other words, a currently
down `subscriber-only` node doesn't stop a DML lock from being acquired.

The `subscriber-only` node forms the building block for PGD Tree
topology. In this topology, a small number of fully active
nodes are replicating changes in all directions. A large
number of `subscriber-only` nodes receive only changes but never
send any changes to any other node in the cluster. This topology avoids
connection explosion due to a large number of nodes, yet provides
an extremely large number of `leaf` nodes that you can use to consume the
data.

To make use of `subscriber-only` nodes, first
create a PGD group of type `subscriber-only`. Make it a subgroup of
the group from which the member nodes receive the replication
changes. Once you create the subgroup, all nodes that intend to become
`subscriber-only` nodes must join the subgroup. You can create more than one
subgroup of `subscriber-only` type, and they can have
different parent groups.

Once a node successfully joins the `subscriber-only` subgroup, it
becomes a `subscriber-only` node and starts receiving replication changes
for the parent group. Any changes made directly on the `subscriber-only`
node aren't replicated.

See [`bdr.create_node_group`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrcreate_node_group) to know how to create a subgroup of a
specific type and belonging to a specific parent group.

#### Notes

Since a `subscriber-only` node doesn't replicate changes to any node in
the cluster, it can't act as a source for syncing replication changes
when a node is parted from the cluster. But if the `subscriber-only`
node already received and applied replication changes from the
parted node that no other node in the cluster currently has, then that
causes inconsistency between the nodes.

For now, you can solve this by setting [`bdr.standby_slot_names`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrstandby_slot_names)
and [`bdr.standby_slots_min_confirmed`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrstandby_slots_min_confirmed) so that there's always a fully active PGD node that's ahead of the `subscriber-only`
nodes.

## Decoding worker

PGD4 provides an option to enable a decoding worker process that performs
decoding once, no matter how many nodes are sent data. This introduces a
new process, the WAL decoder, on each PGD node. One WAL sender process still
exists for each connection, but these processes now just perform the task of
sending and receiving data. Taken together, these changes reduce the CPU
overhead of larger PGD groups and also allow higher replication throughput
since the WAL sender process now spends more time on communication.

`enable_wal_decoder` is an option for each PGD group, which is currently
disabled by default. You can use [`bdr.alter_node_group_config()`](reference/nodes-management-interfaces/#bdralter_node_group_config) to enable or
disable the decoding worker for a PGD group.

When the decoding worker is enabled, PGD stores logical change record (LCR)
files to allow buffering of changes between decoding and when all
subscribing nodes received data. LCR files are stored under the
`pg_logical` directory in each local node's data directory. The number and
size of the LCR files varies as replication lag increases, so this also
needs monitoring. The LCRs that aren't required by any of the PGD nodes are cleaned
periodically. The interval between two consecutive cleanups is controlled by
[`bdr.lcr_cleanup_interval`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrlcr_cleanup_interval), which defaults to 3 minutes. The cleanup is
disabled when [`bdr.lcr_cleanup_interval`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrlcr_cleanup_interval) is zero.

When disabled, logical decoding is performed by the WAL sender process for each
node subscribing to each node. In this case, no LCR files are written.

Even though the decoding worker is enabled for a PGD group, following
GUCs control the production and use of LCR per node. By default
these are `false`. For production and use of LCRs, enable the
decoding worker for the PGD group and set these GUCs to `true` on each of the nodes in the PGD group.

-   [`bdr.enable_wal_decoder`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrenable_wal_decoder) &mdash; When turned `false`, all WAL
    senders using LCRs restart to use WAL directly. When `true`
    along with the PGD group config, a decoding worker process is
    started to produce LCR and WAL Senders use LCR.
-   [`bdr.receive_lcr`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrreceive_lcr) &mdash; When `true` on the subscribing node, it requests WAL
    sender on the publisher node to use LCRs if available.

### Notes

As of now, a decoding worker decodes changes corresponding to the node where it's
running. A logical standby is sent changes from all the nodes in the PGD group
through a single source. Hence a WAL sender serving a logical standby can't
use LCRs right now.

A subscriber-only node receives changes from respective nodes directly. Hence
a WAL sender serving a subscriber-only node can use LCRs.

Even though LCRs are produced, the corresponding WALs are still retained similar
to the case when a decoding worker isn't enabled. In the future, it might be possible
to remove WAL corresponding the LCRs, if they aren't otherwise required.

For reference, the first 24 characters of an LCR file name are similar to those
in a WAL file name. The first 8 characters of the name are all '0' right now.
In the future, they are expected to represent the TimeLineId similar to the first 8
characters of a WAL segment file name. The following sequence of 16 characters
of the name is similar to the WAL segment number, which is used to track LCR
changes against the WAL stream.

However, logical changes are
reordered according to the commit order of the transactions they belong to.
Hence their placement in the LCR segments doesn't match the placement of
corresponding WAL in the WAL segments.

The set of last 16 characters represents the
subsegment number in an LCR segment. Each LCR file corresponds to a
subsegment. LCR files are binary and variable sized. The maximum size of an
LCR file can be controlled by `bdr.max_lcr_segment_file_size`, which
defaults to 1 GB.

## Node restart and down node recovery

PGD is designed to recover from node restart or node disconnection.
The disconnected node rejoins the group by reconnecting
to each peer node and then replicating any missing data from that node.

When a node starts up, each connection begins showing up in [`bdr.node_slots`](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-visible#bdrnode_slots) with
`bdr.node_slots.state = catchup` and begins replicating missing data.
Catching up continues for a period of time that depends on the
amount of missing data from each peer node and will likely increase
over time, depending on the server workload.

If the amount of write activity on each node isn't uniform, the catchup period
from nodes with more data can take significantly longer than other nodes.
Eventually, the slot state changes to `bdr.node_slots.state = streaming`.

Nodes that are offline for longer periods, such as hours or days,
can begin to cause resource issues for various reasons. Don't plan
on extended outages without understanding the following issues.

Each node retains change information (using one
[replication slot](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/logicaldecoding-explanation.html)
for each peer node) so it can later replay changes to a temporarily unreachable node.
If a peer node remains offline indefinitely, this accumulated change information
eventually causes the node to run out of storage space for PostgreSQL
transaction logs (*WAL* in `pg_wal`), and likely causes the database server
to shut down with an error similar to this:

```
PANIC: could not write to file "pg_wal/xlogtemp.559": No space left on device
```

Or, it might report other out-of-disk related symptoms.

In addition, slots for offline nodes also hold back the catalog xmin, preventing
vacuuming of catalog tables.

On EDB Postgres Extended Server and EDB Postgres Advanced Server, offline nodes
also hold back freezing of data to prevent losing conflict-resolution data
(see [Origin conflict detection](consistency/conflicts)).

Administrators must monitor for node outages (see [monitoring](monitoring/))
and make sure nodes have enough free disk space. If the workload is
predictable, you might be able to calculate how much space is used over time,
allowing a prediction of the maximum time a node can be down before critical
issues arise.

Don't manually remove replication slots created by PGD. If you do, the cluster
becomes damaged and the node that was using the
slot must be parted from the cluster, as described in [Replication slots created by PGD](#replication-slots-created-by-pgd).

While a node is offline, the other nodes might not yet have received
the same set of data from the offline node, so this might appear as a slight
divergence across nodes. The parting process corrects this imbalance across nodes.
(Later versions might do this earlier.)

### Replication slots created by PGD

On a PGD master node, the following replication slots are
created by PGD:

-   One *group slot*, named `bdr_<database name>_<group name>`
-   N-1 *node slots*, named `bdr_<database name>_<group name>_<node
    name>`, where N is the total number of PGD nodes in the cluster,
    including direct logical standbys, if any

    Don't drop those slots. PGD creates and manages them and drops them when or if necessary.

On the other hand, you can create or drop replication slots required by software like Barman
or logical replication using the appropriate commands
for the software without any effect on PGD.
Don't start slot names used by other software with the
prefix `bdr_`.

For example, in a cluster composed of the three nodes `alpha`, `beta`, and
`gamma`, where PGD is used to replicate the `mydb` database and the
PGD group is called `mygroup`:

-   Node `alpha` has three slots:
    -   One group slot named `bdr_mydb_mygroup`
    -   Two node slots named `bdr_mydb_mygroup_beta` and
          `bdr_mydb_mygroup_gamma`
-   Node `beta` has three slots:
    -   One group slot named `bdr_mydb_mygroup`
    -   Two node slots named `bdr_mydb_mygroup_alpha` and
          `bdr_mydb_mygroup_gamma`
-   Node `gamma` has three slots:
    -   One group slot named `bdr_mydb_mygroup`
    -   Two node slots named `bdr_mydb_mygroup_alpha` and
          `bdr_mydb_mygroup_beta`

#### Group replication slot

The group slot is an internal slot used by PGD primarily to track the
oldest safe position that any node in the PGD group (including all logical
standbys) has caught up to, for any outbound replication from this node.

The group slot name is given by the function [`bdr.local_group_slot_name()`](/pgd/latest/reference/functions#bdrlocal_group_slot_name).

The group slot can:

-   Join new nodes to the PGD group without having all existing nodes
    up and running (although the majority of nodes should be up), without
    incurring data loss in case the node that was down during join starts
    replicating again.
-   Part nodes from the cluster consistently, even if some nodes haven't
    caught up fully with the parted node.
-   Hold back the freeze point to avoid missing some conflicts.
-   Keep the historical snapshot for timestamp-based snapshots.

The group slot is usually inactive and is fast forwarded only periodically
in response to Raft progress messages from other nodes.

!!! Warning
    Don't drop the group slot. Although usually inactive, it's
    still vital to the proper operation of the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster. If you drop it,
    then some or all of the features can stop working or have
    incorrect outcomes.

### Hashing long identifiers

The name of a replication slot&mdash;like any other PostgreSQL
identifier&mdash;can't be longer than 63 bytes. PGD handles this by
shortening the database name, the PGD group name, and the name of the
node in case the resulting slot name is too long for that limit.
Shortening an identifier is carried out by replacing the final section
of the string with a hash of the string itself.

For example, consider a cluster that replicates a database
named `db20xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` (20 bytes long) using a PGD group named
`group20xxxxxxxxxxxxx` (20 bytes long). The logical replication slot
associated to node `a30xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` (30 bytes long)
is called since `3597186`, `be9cbd0`, and `7f304a2` are respectively the hashes
of `db20xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`, `group20xxxxxxxxxxxxx`, and
`a30xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`.

```
bdr_db20xxxx3597186_group20xbe9cbd0_a30xxxxxxxxxxxxx7f304a2
```

## Removing a node from a PGD group

Since PGD is designed to recover from extended node outages, you
must explicitly tell the system if you're removing a node
permanently. If you permanently shut down a node and don't tell
the other nodes, then performance suffers and eventually
the whole system stops working.

Node removal, also called *parting*, is done using the [`bdr.part_node()`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrpart_node)
function. You must specify the node name (as passed during node creation)
to remove a node. You can call the [`bdr.part_node()`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrpart_node) function from any active
node in the PGD group, including the node that you're removing.

Just like the join procedure, parting is done using Raft consensus and requires a
majority of nodes to be online to work.

The parting process affects all nodes. The Raft leader manages a vote
between nodes to see which node has the most recent data from the parting node.
Then all remaining nodes make a secondary, temporary connection to the
most-recent node to allow them to catch up any missing data.

A parted node still is known to PGD but doesn't consume resources. A
node might be added again under the same name as a parted node.
In rare cases, you might want to clear all metadata of a parted
node by using the function [`bdr.drop_node()`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrdrop_node).

## Removing a whole PGD group

PGD groups usually map to locations. When a location is no longer being deployed,
it's likely that the PGD group for the location also needs to be removed.

The PGD group that's being removed must be empty. Before you can remove the 
group, you must part all the nodes in the group. 

### Uninstalling PGD

Dropping the PGD extension removes all the PGD objects in a node,
including metadata tables. You can do this with the following
command:

```sql
DROP EXTENSION bdr;
```

If the database depends on some PGD-specific objects, then you can't drop the PGD
extension. Examples include:

-   Tables using PGD-specific sequences such as `SnowflakeId` or `galloc`
-   Column using CRDT data types
-   Views that depend on some PGD catalog tables

Remove those dependencies before dropping the BDR extension.
For example, drop the dependent objects, alter the column
type to a non-PGD equivalent, or change the sequence type back to
`local`.

!!! Warning
    You can drop the BDR extension only if the node was
    successfully parted from its PGD node group or if it's the last
    node in the group. Dropping PGD metadata breaks replication to and from the other nodes.

!!! Warning
    When dropping a local PGD node or the BDR extension in the local
    database, any preexisting session might still try to execute a PGD-specific workflow
    and therefore fail. You can solve the problem
    by disconnecting the session and then reconnecting the client or
    by restarting the instance.

There's also a [`bdr.drop_node()`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrdrop_node) function. Use this function only in
emergencies, such as if there's a problem with parting.

## Listing PGD topology

### Listing PGD groups

The following simple query lists all the PGD node groups of which the current
node is a member. It currently returns only one row from
[`bdr.local_node_summary`](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-visible#bdrlocal_node_summary).

```sql
SELECT node_group_name
FROM bdr.local_node_summary;
```

You can display the configuration of each node group using a more
complex query:

```sql
SELECT g.node_group_name
, ns.pub_repsets
, ns.sub_repsets
, g.node_group_default_repset     AS default_repset
, node_group_check_constraints    AS check_constraints
FROM bdr.local_node_summary ns
JOIN bdr.node_group g USING (node_group_name);
```

### Listing nodes in a PGD group

You can extract the list of all nodes in a given node group (such as `mygroup`)
from the [`bdr.node_summary`](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-visible#bdrnode_summary)` view as shown in the following
example:

```sql
SELECT node_name         AS name
, node_seq_id            AS ord
, peer_state_name        AS current_state
, peer_target_state_name AS target_state
, interface_connstr      AS dsn
FROM bdr.node_summary
WHERE node_group_name = 'mygroup';
```

The read-only state of a node, as shown in the
`current_state` or in the `target_state` query columns, is indicated
as `STANDBY`.
