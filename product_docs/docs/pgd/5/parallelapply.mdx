## What is Parallel Apply?

Parallel Apply is a feature of PGD that allows a PGD node to use multiple
writers per subscription. This behavior generally increases the throughput of a
subscription and improves replication performance.

### Configuring Parallel Apply

Two variables control Parallel Apply in PGD 5:
[`bdr.max_writers_per_subscription`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrmax_writers_per_subscription)
(defaults to 8) and
[`bdr.writers_per_subscription`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrwriters_per_subscription)
(defaults to 2).

```plain
bdr.max_writers_per_subscription = 8
bdr.writers_per_subscription = 2
```

This configuration gives each subscription two writers. However, in some
circumstances, the system might allocate up to eight writers for a subscription.

You can only change
[`bdr.max_writers_per_subscription`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrmax_writers_per_subscription)
with a server restart.

You can change
[`bdr.writers_per_subscription`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrwriters_per_subscription)
for a specific subscription without a restart by:

1. Halting the subscription using
   [`bdr.alter_subscription_disable`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdralter_subscription_disable).
1. Setting the new value.
1. Resuming the subscription using
   [`bdr.alter_subscription_enable`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdralter_subscription_enable). 


First though, establish the name of the subscription using `select * from
bdr.subscription`. For this example, the subscription name is
`bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup_node2_node1`.

```sql
SELECT bdr.alter_subscription_disable ('bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup_node2_node1');

UPDATE bdr.subscription
SET num_writers = 4
WHERE sub_name = 'bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup_node2_node1';

SELECT bdr.alter_subscription_enable ('bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup_node2_node1');
```

### When to use Parallel Apply

Parallel Apply is always on by default and, for most operations, we recommend leaving it on.

### Monitoring Parallel Apply

To support Parallel Apply's deadlock mitigation, PGD 5.2 adds columns to
[`bdr.stat_subscription`](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-visible#bdrstat_subscription).
The new columns are `nprovisional_waits`, `ntuple_waits`, and `ncommmit_waits`.
These are metrics that indicate how well Parallel Apply is managing what
previously would have been deadlocks. They don't reflect overall system
performance.

The `nprovisional_waits` value reflects the number of operations on the same
tuples being performed by concurrent apply transactions. These are provisional
waits that aren't actually waiting yet but could. 

If a tuple's write needs to wait until it can be safely applied, it's counted in
`ntuple_waits`. Fully applied transactions that waited before being committed
are counted in `ncommit_waits`. 

### Disabling Parallel Apply

To disable Parallel Apply, set [`bdr.writers_per_subscription`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrwriters_per_subscription) to `1`.

### Deadlock mitigation

When Parallel Apply is operating, the transactional changes from the
subscription are written by multiple writers. However, each writer ensures that
the final commit of its transaction doesn't violate the commit order as executed
on the origin node. If there's a violation, an error is generated and the
transaction can be rolled back.

This mechanism previously meant that when the following are all true, the
resulting error could manifest as a deadlock:

- A transaction is pending commit and modifies a row that another transaction needs to change. 
- That other transaction executed on the origin node before the pending transaction did.
- The pending transaction took out a lock request.

Additionally, handling the error could increase replication lag, due to a
combination of the time taken:

- To detect the deadlock
- For the client to roll back its transaction 
- For indirect garbage collection of the changes that were already applied 
- To redo the work 

This is where Parallel Apply’s deadlock mitigation, introduced in PGD 5.2, can
help. For any transaction, Parallel Apply looks at transactions already
scheduled for any row (tuple) that the current transaction wants to write. If it
finds one, the row is marked as needing to wait until the other transaction is
committed before applying its change to the row. This approach ensures that rows
are written in the correct order.  

<!-- ### On-demand dedicated writer

In PGD 5.4, an on-demand writer mechanism was added to Parallel Apply. This
handles the commit phase of prepared GROUP COMMIT transactions by dedicating a
writer to participate in the commit confirmation of the GROUP COMMIT. Doing so
enables the continued free flow of non GROUP COMMIT transactions through
remaining Parallel Apply writers while ensuring consistency for the GROUP
COMMIT. -->

### Parallel Apply Support

Up to and including PGD 5.1, don't use Parallel Apply with Group Commit, CAMO, and Eager Replication. Disable Parallel Apply in these scenarios. If, using PGD 5.1 or earlier, you're experiencing a large number of deadlocks, you might also want to disable Parallel Apply or consider upgrading.

From PGD 5.2, Parallel Apply works with CAMO. It isn't compatible with Group Commit or Eager Replication, so disable it if Group Commit or Eager Replication are in use.
