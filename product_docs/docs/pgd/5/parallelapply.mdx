### What is Parallel Apply?

Parallel Apply is a feature of PGD that allows a PGD node to use multiple writers per subscription. This generally increases the throughput of a subscription and improves replication performance.

The transactional changes from the subscription are written by the multiple Parallel Apply writers. However, each writer ensures that the final commit of its transaction does not violate the commit order as executed on the origin node. If there is a violation, an error is generated and the transaction can be rolled back. 

!!! Warning Possible deadlocks
It may be possible that this out-of-order application of changes could trigger a deadlock. PGD currently resolves such deadlocks between Parallel Apply writers by aborting and retrying the transactions involved. If you experience a large number of such deadlocks, this is an indication that Parallel Apply is not a good fit for your workload and you should consider disabling it.

### Configuring Parallel Apply
There are two variables which control Parallel Apply in PGD 5, [`bdr.max_writers_per_subscription`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrmax_writers_per_subscription) and [`bdr.writers_per_subscription`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrwriters_per_subscription). The default settings for these are 8 and 2.

```plain
bdr.max_writers_per_subscription = 8
bdr.writers_per_subscription = 2
```

This gives each subscription two writers, but in some circumstances, the system may allocate up to 8 writers for a subscription.

[`bdr.max_writers_per_subscription`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrmax_writers_per_subscription) can only be changed with a server restart.

[`bdr.writers_per_subscription`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrwriters_per_subscription) can be changed, for a specific subscription, without a restart by halting the subscription using [`bdr.alter_subscription_disable`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdralter_subscription_disable), setting the new value and then resuming the subscription using [`bdr.alter_subscription_enable`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdralter_subscription_enable). First establish the name of the subscription using `select * from bdr.subscription`. For this example, the subscription name is `bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup_node2_node1`.


```sql
SELECT bdr.alter_subscription_disable ('bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup_node2_node1');

UPDATE bdr.subscription
SET num_writers = 4
WHERE sub_name = 'bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup_node2_node1';

SELECT bdr.alter_subscription_enable ('bdr_bdrdb_bdrgroup_node2_node1');
```

### When to use Parallel Apply

Parallel Apply is always on by default and for most operations, we recommend that it is left on.

### When not to use Parallel Apply

As of, and up to at least PGD 5.1, Parallel Apply should not be used with Group Commit, CAMO and eager replication. You should disable Parallel Apply in these scenarios. If you are experiencing a large number of deadlocks, you may also want to disable it.

### Disabling Parallel Apply

To disable Parallel Apply set [`bdr.writers_per_subscription`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrwriters_per_subscription) to 1.
