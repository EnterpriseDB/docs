The standard way of deploying EDB Postgres Distributed in a self managed setting,
including physical and virtual machines, both self-hosted and in the cloud
(EC2), is to use EDB's deployment tool: [Trusted Postgres Architect](/tpa/latest/) (TPA).

## Getting started

For details on installing TPA, see: [TPA installation](/tpa/latest/INSTALL/).
