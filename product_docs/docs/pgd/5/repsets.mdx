A replication set is a group of tables that a PGD node can subscribe to.
You can use replication sets to create more complex replication topologies
than regular symmetric multi-master where each node is an exact copy of the other
nodes.

Every PGD group creates a replication set with the same name as
the group. This replication set is the default replication set, which is
used for all user tables and DDL replication. All nodes are subscribed to it.
In other words, by default all user tables are replicated between all nodes.

## Using replication sets

You can create replication sets using [`bdr.create_replication_set`](/pgd/latest/reference/repsets-management#bdrcreate_replication_set),
specifying whether to include insert, update, delete, or truncate actions.
One option lets you add existing tables to the set, and
a second option defines whether to add tables when they are
created.

You can also manually define the tables to add or remove from a
replication set.

Tables included in the replication set are maintained when the node
joins the cluster and afterwards.

Once the node is joined, you can still remove tables from the replication
set, but you must add new tables using a resync operation.

By default, a newly defined replication set doesn't replicate DDL or PGD
administration function calls. Use [`bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter`](/pgd/latest/reference/repsets-ddl-filtering#bdrreplication_set_add_ddl_filter)
to define the commands to replicate.

PGD creates replication set definitions on all nodes. Each node can then be
defined to publish or subscribe to each replication set using
[`bdr.alter_node_replication_sets`](/pgd/latest/reference/repsets-management#bdralter_node_replication_sets).

You can use functions to alter these definitions later or to drop the replication
set.

!!! Note
    Don't use the default replication set for selective replication.
    Don't drop or modify the default replication set on any of
    the PGD nodes in the cluster as it is also used by default for DDL
    replication and administration function calls.

## Behavior of partitioned tables

PGD supports partitioned tables transparently, meaning that you can add a partitioned
table to a replication set.

Changes that involve any of the partitions are replicated downstream.

!!! Note
    When partitions are replicated through a partitioned table, the
    statements executed directly on a partition are replicated as they
    were executed on the parent table. The exception is the `TRUNCATE` command,
    which always replicates with the list of affected tables or partitions.

You can add individual partitions to the replication set, in which case they are
replicated like regular tables (to the table of the same name as the partition
on the downstream). This has some performance advantages if the partitioning
definition is the same on both provider and subscriber, as the partitioning
logic doesn't have to be executed.

!!! Note
    If a root partitioned table is part of any replication set, memberships
    of individual partitions are ignored. only the membership of that root
    table is taken into account.

## Behavior with foreign keys

A foreign key constraint ensures that each row in the referencing table matches
a row in the referenced table. Therefore, if the referencing table is a member
of a replication set, the referenced table must also be a member of the same
replication set.

The current version of PGD doesn't automatically check for or enforce this
condition. When adding a table to a replication set, the database administrator
must make sure that all the tables referenced by foreign keys are also added.

You can use the following query to list all the foreign keys and replication
sets that don't satisfy this requirement. The referencing table is a member of
the replication set, while the referenced table isn't:

```sql
SELECT t1.relname,
       t1.nspname,
       fk.conname,
       t1.set_name
  FROM bdr.tables AS t1
  JOIN pg_catalog.pg_constraint AS fk
    ON fk.conrelid = t1.relid
   AND fk.contype = 'f'
 WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT *
    FROM bdr.tables AS t2
   WHERE t2.relid = fk.confrelid
     AND t2.set_name = t1.set_name
);
```

The output of this query looks like the following:

```sql
 relname | nspname |  conname  | set_name
---------+---------+-----------+----------
 t2      | public  | t2_x_fkey | s2
(1 row)
```

This means that table `t2` is a member of replication set `s2`, but the
table referenced by the foreign key `t2_x_fkey` isn't.

The `TRUNCATE CASCADE` command takes into account the
replication set membership before replicating the command. For example:

```sql
TRUNCATE table1 CASCADE;
```

This becomes a `TRUNCATE` without cascade on all the tables that are
part of the replication set only:

```sql
TRUNCATE table1, referencing_table1, referencing_table2 ...
```


## Replication set membership

You can add tables to or remove them from one or more replication sets. This
affects replication only of changes (DML) in those tables. Schema changes (DDL) are
handled by DDL replication set filters (see [DDL replication filtering](#ddl-replication-filtering)).

The replication uses the table membership in replication sets 
with the node replication sets configuration to determine the actions to
replicate to which node. The decision is done using the union of all the
memberships and replication set options. Suppose that a table is a member
of replication set A that replicates only INSERT actions and replication set B that
replicates only UPDATE actions. Both INSERT and UPDATE actions are replicated if the
target node is also subscribed to both replication set A and B.

You can control membership using [`bdr.replication_set_add_table`](/pgd/latest/reference/repsets-membership#bdrreplication_set_add_table) and [`bdr.replication_set_remove_table`](/pgd/latest/reference/repsets-membership#bdrreplication_set_remove_table).

## Listing replication sets

You can list existing replication sets with the following query:

```sql
SELECT set_name
FROM bdr.replication_sets;
```

You can use this query to list all the tables in a given replication
set:

```sql
SELECT nspname, relname
FROM bdr.tables
WHERE set_name = 'myrepset';
```

In [Behavior with foreign keys](#behavior-with-foreign-keys), we show a
query that lists all the foreign keys whose referenced table isn't
included in the same replication set as the referencing table.

Use the following SQL to show those replication sets that the
current node publishes and subscribes from:

```sql
 SELECT node_id,
        node_name,
        pub_repsets,
        sub_repsets
   FROM bdr.local_node_summary;
```

This code produces output like this:

```sql
  node_id   | node_name |    pub_repsets     |   sub_repsets
------------+-----------+----------------------------------------
 1834550102 | s01db01   | {bdrglobal,bdrs01} | {bdrglobal,bdrs01}
(1 row)
```

To execute the same query against all nodes in the cluster, you can use the
following query. This approach gets the replication sets associated with all
nodes at the same time.

```sql
WITH node_repsets AS (
  SELECT jsonb_array_elements(
    bdr.run_on_all_nodes($$
        SELECT
          node_id,
          node_name,
          pub_repsets,
          sub_repsets
		FROM bdr.local_node_summary;
    $$)::jsonb
  ) AS j
)
SELECT j->'response'->'command_tuples'->0->>'node_id' AS node_id,
       j->'response'->'command_tuples'->0->>'node_name' AS node_name,
       j->'response'->'command_tuples'->0->>'pub_repsets' AS pub_repsets,
       j->'response'->'command_tuples'->0->>'sub_repsets' AS sub_repsets
FROM node_repsets;
```

This shows, for example:

```sql
  node_id   | node_name |    pub_repsets     |    sub_repsets
------------+-----------+----------------------------------------
 933864801  | s02db01   | {bdrglobal,bdrs02} | {bdrglobal,bdrs02}
 1834550102 | s01db01   | {bdrglobal,bdrs01} | {bdrglobal,bdrs01}
 3898940082 | s01db02   | {bdrglobal,bdrs01} | {bdrglobal,bdrs01}
 1102086297 | s02db02   | {bdrglobal,bdrs02} | {bdrglobal,bdrs02}
(4 rows)
```

## DDL replication filtering 

By default, the replication of all supported DDL happens by way of the default
PGD group replication set. This is achieved with a DDL filter with the same name
as the PGD group. This filter is added to the default PGD group replication set
when the PGD group is created.

You can adjust this by changing the DDL replication filters for all existing
replication sets. These filters are independent of table membership in the
replication sets. Just like data changes, each DDL statement is replicated only
once, even if it's matched by multiple filters on multiple replication sets.

You can list existing DDL filters with the following query, which shows for each
filter the regular expression applied to the command tag and to the role name:

```sql
SELECT * FROM bdr.ddl_replication;
```

You can use [`bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter`](/pgd/latest/reference/repsets-ddl-filtering#bdrreplication_set_add_ddl_filter) and [`bdr.replication_set_remove_ddl_filter`](/pgd/latest/reference/repsets-ddl-filtering#bdrreplication_set_remove_ddl_filter)  to manipulate DDL filters. 
They are considered to be `DDL` and are therefore subject to DDL
replication and global locking.
