The EDB Postgres Distributed Command Line Interface (PGD CLI) is a tool to manage your EDB Postgres Distributed cluster. It allows you to run commands against EDB Postgres Distributed  clusters. 

See the [Command reference](command_ref) for the available commands to inspect, manage, and get information on cluster resources.

See [Installing PGD CLI](installing_cli) for information about how TPAexec deploys PGD CLI, how to install PGD CLI on a standalone server manually, and specifying connection strings.

## Requirements

The PGD CLI requires postgres superuser privileges to run.

## Using the PGD CLI
`pgd` is the command name for the PGD command line interface. See [pgd](command_ref) in the Command reference for a description of the command options. See the following sections for sample use cases.


## Specifying a configuration file

If you rename the file or move it to another location, specify the new name and location using the optional `-f` or `--config-file` flag. For example:

```sh
  pgd show-nodes -f /opt/my-config.yml
```

## Passing a database connection string 

Use the `--dsn` flag to pass a database connection string directly to a command. You don't need a configuration file if you pass the connection string with this flag. The flag takes precedence if a configuration file is present. For example:

```sh
pgd show-nodes --dsn "host=bdr-a1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=postgres "
```
## Specifying the output format

The PGD CLI supports the following output formats:

| Format  | Considerations |
| ------- | -------------- |
| tabular | Default format. Presents the data in tabular form.|
| json    | Presents the raw data with no formatting. For some commands, the json output may show more data than shown in the tabular output such as extra fields and more detailed messages. |
| yaml    | Same as json except field order is alphabetical. Experimental and may not be fully supported in future versions. |

Use the `-o` or `--output` flag to change the default output format to json or yaml. For example:

```sh
pgd show-nodes -o json
```
## Accessing the command line help

To list the supported commands, enter:

```sh
pgd help
```

For help for a specific command and its parameters, enter `pgd help <command_name>`. For example:

```sh
pgd help show-nodes
```
