- relnote: Fix for Replication Breakage on Concurrent Updates
  component: BDR
  details: |
    A fix has been implemented to resolve an issue where concurrent updates on non-unique indexes could cause replication to break with a "concurrent INSERT when looking for delete rows" error. This bug was caused by an incorrect comparison of tuples during the lookup process. The fix ensures that the correct tuples are compared, which prevents this error and maintains replication stability.

- relnote: Fix for `bdr_init_physical` Hangs with Synchronous Commit
  component: BDR
  details: |
    A bug has been fixed that could cause `bdr_init_physical` to hang when the upstream node had a synchronous commit scope. This issue, which prevented a new node from completing physical initialization, was caused by a specific interaction with synchronous commit settings. The fix ensures that `bdr_init_physical` now works reliably in all configurations, even before the new node joins the group and is considered for synchronous commits.
