intro: |
  This is a minor release of PGD 4 for customers on an Extended Life Support contract. This release is a prerequisite for upgrading to PGD 6.2.0+. This release also includes a number of bug fixes. 
relnotes:
- relnote: Fixed an issue to ensure that the values of `node_uuid` and `node_kind` of a node are preserved after joining a cluster in a different PGD version.
  details: |
      This bug caused the `node_uuid` in system tables (`bdr.local_node` and `bdr.node`) to diverge after a full cluster upgrade. The fix ensures that the joining node's UUID and kind are correctly preserved throughout the process.
