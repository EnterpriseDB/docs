## Installing Postgres

You need to install Postgres on all the hosts.

An EDB account is required to use the [EDB Repos 2.0](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos) page where you can get installation instructions.
Select your platform and Postgres edition. 
You're presented with two steps of instructions. The first covers how to configure the required package repository and the second covers how to install the packages from that repository.

Run both steps.

## Worked example

In this example, EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14 is installed on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 (RHEL 9).

!!! Note
PGD 4 doesn't support Postgres versions 15, 16, or later.
!!!

### EDB account

You need an EDB account to install both Postgres and PGD.

Use your EDB account to sign in to the [EDB Repos 2.0](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos) page where you can select your platform. Then scroll down the list to select the Postgres version you want to install:

* EDB Postgres Advanced Server (up to and including version 14)
* EDB Postgres Extended (up to and including version 14)
* PostgreSQL (up to and including version 14)


When you select the version of the Postgres server you want, two steps are displayed.


### 1: Configuring repositories

For step 1, you can choose to use the automated script or step through the manual install instructions that are displayed. Your EDB repository token will be automatically inserted by the EDB Repos 2.0 site into these scripts. 
In these examples, the token is shown as `XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`.

On each provisioned host, you can run the automatic repository installation script, which looks like this: 

```shell
curl -1sLf 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/enterprise/setup.rpm.sh' | sudo -E bash
```

Or you can use the manual installation steps, which looks like this:

```shell
dnf install yum-utils 
rpm --import 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/enterprise/gpg.E71EB0829F1EF813.key'
curl -1sLf 'https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX/enterprise/config.rpm.txt?distro=el&codename=9' > /tmp/enterprise.repo
dnf config-manager --add-repo '/tmp/enterprise.repo'
dnf -q makecache -y --disablerepo='*' --enablerepo='enterprisedb-enterprise'
```

### 2: Install Postgres

For step 2, just run the command to install the packages:

```
sudo dnf -y install edb-as14-server
```
