## Provisioning hosts

The first step in the process of deploying PGD is to provision and configure hosts.

You can deploy to virtual machine instances in the cloud with Linux installed, on-premises virtual machines with Linux installed, or on-premises physical hardware, also with Linux installed. 

Whichever [supported Linux operating system](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#bdr) and whichever deployment platform you select, the result of provisioning a machine must be a Linux system that you can access using SSH with a user that has superuser, administrator, or sudo privileges.

Each machine provisioned must be able to make connections to any other machine you're provisioning for your cluster. 

On cloud deployments, this can be done over the public network or over a VPC. 

On-premises deployments must be able to connect over the local network.

!!! Note Cloud provisioning guides

If you're new to cloud provisioning, these guides may provide assistance:

  Vendor | Platform | Guide
  ------ | -------- | ------
  Amazon | AWS      | [Tutorial: Get started with Amazon EC2 Linux instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)
  Microsoft | Azure | [Quickstart: Create a Linux virtual machine in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal?tabs=ubuntu)

### Configuring hosts

#### Create an admin user

We recommend that you configure an admin user for each provisioned instance. 
The admin user must have superuser or sudo (to superuser) privileges.
We also recommend that the admin user be configured for passwordless SSH access using certificates. 

#### Ensure networking connectivity

With the admin user created, ensure that each machine can communicate with the other machines you're provisioning.

In particular, the PostgreSQL TCP/IP port (5444 for EDB Postgres Advanced
Server, 5432 for EDB Postgres Extended and community PostgreSQL) must be open
to all machines in the cluster. If you plan to deploy PGD Proxy, its port must be
open to any applications that will connect to the cluster. Port 6432 is typically
used for PGD Proxy.

## Worked example

For the example in this section, three hosts are provisioned with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.

* `host-one`
* `host-two`
* `host-three`

Each is configured with an admin user named admin.

These hosts have been configured in the cloud. As such, each host has both a public and private IP address.

 Name | Public IP | Private IP 
------|-----------|----------------------
 host-one | 172.24.117.204 | 192.168.254.166 
 host-two | 172.24.113.247 | 192.168.254.247
 host-three | 172.24.117.23 | 192.168.254.135

For this example, the cluster's `/etc/hosts` file was edited to use those private IP addresses:

```
192.168.254.166 host-one
192.168.254.247 host-two
192.168.254.135 host-three
```
