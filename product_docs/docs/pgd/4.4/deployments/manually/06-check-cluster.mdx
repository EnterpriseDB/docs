## Checking the cluster


With the cluster up and running, it's worthwhile to run some basic checks to see how effectively it's replicating.

The following example shows one quick way to do this, but make sure that any testing you perform is appropriate for your use case.

* **Preparation**
  * Ensure the cluster is ready. 
    * Log into the database on `host-one`/`node-one`. 
    * Run `select bdr.wait_slot_confirm_lsn(NULL, NULL);`.  
    * When the query returns, the cluster is ready.  


* **Create data**
  The simplest way to test the cluster is replicating is to log into one node, create a table, and populate it.
   * On `node-one`, create a table:
      ```sql
      CREATE TABLE quicktest ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, value INT ); 
      ```
   * On `node-one`, populate the table:
     ```sql
     INSERT INTO quicktest (value) SELECT random()*10000 FROM generate_series(1,10000);
     ```
   * On `node-one`, monitor performance:
     ```sql
     select * from bdr.node_replication_rates;
     ```
   * On `node-one`, get a sum of the value column (for checking):
     ```sql
     select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
     ```
* **Check data**
   * Log into `node-two`.
      Log into the database on `host-two`/`node-two`.
    * On `node-two`, get a sum of the value column (for checking):
      ```sql
      select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
      ```
   * Compare with the result from `node-one`.
   * Log into `node-three`.
      Log into the database on `host-three`/`node-three`.
    * On `node-three`, get a sum of the value column (for checking):
      ```sql
      select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
      ```
   * Compare with the result from `node-one` and `node-two`.

## Worked example

### Preparation

Log into the `host-one` Postgres server:
```
ssh admin@host-one
sudo -iu enterprisedb psql bdrdb
```

This is your connection to PGD's `node-one`.

#### Ensure the cluster is ready

To ensure that the cluster is ready to go, run: 

```
select bdr.wait_slot_confirm_lsn(NULL, NULL)
```

This query will block while the cluster is busy initializing and return when the cluster is ready.

In another window, log into the `host-two` Postgres server:

```
ssh admin@host-two
sudo -iu enterprisedb psql bdrdb
```

### Create data

#### On node-one create a table

Run:

```sql
CREATE TABLE quicktest ( id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, value INT ); 
```

#### On node-one populate the table

```
INSERT INTO quicktest (value) SELECT random()*10000 FROM generate_series(1,10000);
```

This command generates a table of 10000 rows of random values. 

#### On node-one monitor performance

As soon as possible, run:

```sql
select * from bdr.node_replication_rates;
```

This command returns statistics on how quickly that data was replicated to the other two nodes:

```console
bdrdb=# select * from bdr.node_replication_rates;
 peer_node_id | target_name | sent_lsn  | replay_lsn | replay_lag | replay_lag_bytes | replay_lag_size | apply_rate | catchup_interv
al
--------------+-------------+-----------+------------+------------+------------------+-----------------+------------+---------------
---
   1954860017 | node-three  | 0/DDAA908 | 0/DDAA908  | 00:00:00   |                0 | 0 bytes         |      13682 | 00:00:00
   2299992455 | node-two    | 0/DDAA908 | 0/DDAA908  | 00:00:00   |                0 | 0 bytes         |      13763 | 00:00:00
(2 rows)
```

And it's already replicated. 

#### On node-one get a checksum

To get some values from the generated data, run:

```sql
select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
```

This command returns:

```sql
bdrdb=# select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
__OUTPUT__
 count  |    sum
--------+-----------
 100000 | 498884606
(1 row)
```

### Check data

#### Log into host-two's Postgres server.
```
ssh admin@host-two
sudo -iu enterprisedb psql bdrdb
```

This is your connection to PGD's `node-two`.

#### On node-two get a checksum

To get node-two's values for the generated data, run:

```sql
select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
```

This command returns:

```sql
bdrdb=# select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
__OUTPUT__
 count  |    sum
--------+-----------
 100000 | 498884606
(1 row)
```

#### Compare with the result from node-one

When you compare with the result from `node-one`, the values will be identical.

You can repeat the process with `node-three` or generate new data on any node and see it replicate to the other nodes.

#### Log into host-three's Postgres server
```
ssh admin@host-two
sudo -iu enterprisedb psql bdrdb
```

This is your connection to PGD's `node-three`.

#### On node-three get a checksum

To get the `node-three` values for the generated data, run:

```sql
select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
```
This command returns:

```sql
bdrdb=# select COUNT(*),SUM(value) from quicktest;
__OUTPUT__
 count  |    sum
--------+-----------
 100000 | 498884606
(1 row)
```

#### Compare with the result from node-one and node-two

When you compare the results, the values will be identical.
