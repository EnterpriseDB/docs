You can deploy and install EDB Postgres Distributed products using the following methods:

-   TPAexec is an orchestration tool that uses Ansible to build Postgres clusters as specified by TPA (Trusted Postgres Architecture), a set of reference architectures that document how to set up and operate Postgres in various scenarios. TPA represents the best practices followed by EDB, and its recommendations are as applicable to quick testbed setups as to production environments. To deploy PGD using TPA, see the [TPA documentation](tpaexec/installing_tpaexec/). 

-   Manual installation is also available where TPA is not an option. Details of how to deploy PGD manually are in the [manual installation](/pgd/4/deployments/manually/) section of the documentation.

-   EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service is a fully managed database-as-a-service with built-in Oracle compatibility, running in your cloud account and operated by the Postgres experts. Cloud Service makes it easy to set up, manage, and scale your databases. The addition of distributed high availability support through EDB Postres Distributed allows single-region or multi-region clusters with one or two data groups. See the [Distributed high availability](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/references/supported_cluster_types/distributed_highavailability/) topic in the [EDB Postgres AI Cloud Service documentation](/edb-postgres-ai/cloud-service/) for more information.

-   EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes is a Kubernetes operator is designed, developed, and supported by EDB that covers the full lifecycle of a highly available Postgres database clusters with a multi-master architecture, using BDR replication. It is based on the open source CloudNativePG operator, and provides additional value such as compatibility with Oracle using EDB Postgres Advanced Server and additional supported platforms such as IBM Power and OpenShift.
