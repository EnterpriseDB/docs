title: Replication sets


---

A replication set is a group of tables that a BDR node can subscribe to.
You can use replication sets to create more complex replication topologies
than regular symmetric multi-master where each node is an exact copy of the other
nodes.

Every BDR group creates a replication set with the same name as
the group. This replication set is the default replication set, which is
used for all user tables and DDL replication. All nodes are subscribed to it.
In other words, by default all user tables are replicated between all nodes.

## Using replication sets

You can create replication sets using `create_replication_set()`,
specifying whether to include insert, update, delete, or truncate actions.
One option lets you add existing tables to the set, and
a second option defines whether to add tables when they are
created.

You can also manually define the tables to add or remove from a
replication set.

Tables included in the replication set are maintained when the node
joins the cluster and afterwards.

Once the node is joined, you can still remove tables from the replication
set, but you must add new tables using a resync operation.

By default, a newly defined replication set doesn't replicate DDL or BDR
administration function calls. Use `replication_set_add_ddl_filter`
to define the commands to replicate.

BDR creates replication set definitions on all nodes. Each node can then be
defined to publish or subscribe to each replication set using
`alter_node_replication_sets`.

You can use functions to alter these definitions later or to drop the replication
set.

!!! Note
    Don't use the default replication set for selective replication.
    Don't drop or modify the default replication set on any of
    the BDR nodes in the cluster as it is also used by default for DDL
    replication and administration function calls.

## Behavior of partitioned tables

BDR supports partitioned tables transparently, meaning that you can add a partitioned
table to a replication set.
Changes that involve any of the partitions are replicated downstream.

!!! Note
    When partitions are replicated through a partitioned table, the
    statements executed directly on a partition are replicated as they
    were executed on the parent table. The exception is the `TRUNCATE` command,
    which always replicates with the list of affected tables or partitions.

You can add individual partitions to the replication set, in
which case they are replicated like regular tables (to the table of the
same name as the partition on the downstream). This has some performance
advantages if the partitioning definition is the same on both provider and
subscriber, as the partitioning logic doesn't have to be executed.

!!! Note
    If a root partitioned table is part of any replication set, memberships
    of individual partitions are ignored. only the membership of that root
    table is taken into account.

## Behavior with foreign keys

A foreign key constraint ensures that each row in the referencing
table matches a row in the referenced table. Therefore, if the
referencing table is a member of a replication set, the referenced
table must also be a member of the same replication set.

The current version of BDR doesn't automatically check for or enforce
this condition. When adding a table to a replication set, the database administrator must 
make sure
that all the tables referenced by foreign keys are also added.

You can use the following query to list all the foreign keys and
replication sets that don't satisfy this requirement.
The referencing table is a member of the replication set, while the
referenced table isn't:

```sql
SELECT t1.relname,
       t1.nspname,
       fk.conname,
       t1.set_name
  FROM bdr.tables AS t1
  JOIN pg_catalog.pg_constraint AS fk
    ON fk.conrelid = t1.relid
   AND fk.contype = 'f'
 WHERE NOT EXISTS (
  SELECT *
    FROM bdr.tables AS t2
   WHERE t2.relid = fk.confrelid
     AND t2.set_name = t1.set_name
);
```

The output of this query looks like the following:

```sql
 relname | nspname |  conname  | set_name
---------+---------+-----------+----------
 t2      | public  | t2_x_fkey | s2
(1 row)
```

This means that table `t2` is a member of replication set `s2`, but the
table referenced by the foreign key `t2_x_fkey` isn't.

The `TRUNCATE CASCADE` command takes into account the
replication set membership before replicating the command. For example:

```sql
TRUNCATE table1 CASCADE;
```

This becomes a `TRUNCATE` without cascade on all the tables that are
part of the replication set only:

```sql
TRUNCATE table1, referencing_table1, referencing_table2 ...
```

## Replication set management

Management of replication sets.

With the exception of `bdr.alter_node_replication_sets`, the following
functions are considered to be `DDL`. DDL replication and global locking
apply to them, if that's currently active. See [DDL replication](ddl).

### bdr.create_replication_set

This function creates a replication set.

Replication of this command is affected by DDL replication configuration
including DDL filtering settings.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.create_replication_set(set_name name,
                           replicate_insert boolean DEFAULT true,
                           replicate_update boolean DEFAULT true,
                           replicate_delete boolean DEFAULT true,
                           replicate_truncate boolean DEFAULT true,
                           autoadd_tables boolean DEFAULT false,
                           autoadd_existing boolean DEFAULT true)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` &mdash; Name of the new replication set. Must be unique across the BDR
     group.
-   `replicate_insert` &mdash; Indicates whether to replicate inserts into tables in this
    replication set.
-   `replicate_update` &mdash; Indicates whether to replicate updates of tables in this
    replication set.
-   `replicate_delete` &mdash; Indicates whether to replicate deletes from tables in this
    replication set.
-   `replicate_truncate` &mdash; Indicates whether to replicate truncates of tables in this
    replication set.
-   `autoadd_tables` &mdash; Indicates whether to replicate newly created (future) tables 
    to this replication set
-   `autoadd_existing` &mdash; Indicates whether to add all existing user tables 
    to this replication set. This parameter has an effect only if `autoadd_tables` is
    set to `true`.

#### Notes

By default, new replication sets don't replicate DDL or BDR administration
function calls. See [ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering) for how to set
up DDL replication for replication sets. A preexisting DDL filter
is set up for the default group replication set that replicates all DDL and admin
function calls. It's created when the group is created but can be dropped
in case you don't want the BDR group default replication set to replicate
DDL or the BDR administration function calls.

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This means
that the replication is affected by the [ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration.

The function takes a `DDL` global lock.

This function is transactional. You can roll back the effects with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction. The changes are visible to the current
transaction.

### bdr.alter_replication_set

This function modifies the options of an existing replication set.

Replication of this command is affected by DDL replication configuration,
including DDL filtering settings.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_replication_set(set_name name,
                          replicate_insert boolean DEFAULT NULL,
                          replicate_update boolean DEFAULT NULL,
                          replicate_delete boolean DEFAULT NULL,
                          replicate_truncate boolean DEFAULT NULL,
                          autoadd_tables boolean DEFAULT NULL)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` &mdash; Name of an existing replication set.
-   `replicate_insert` &mdash; Indicates whether to replicate inserts into tables in this
    replication set.
-   `replicate_update` &mdash; Indicates whether to replicate updates of tables in this
    replication set.
-   `replicate_delete` &mdash; Indicates whether to replicate deletes from tables in this
    replication set.
-   `replicate_truncate` &mdash; Indicates whether to replicate truncates of tables in this
    replication set.
-   `autoadd_tables` &mdash; Indicates whether to add newly created (future) tables to this replication set.

Any of the options that are set to NULL (the default) remain the same as
before.

#### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This means
the replication is affected by the [ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration.

The function takes a `DDL` global lock.

This function is transactional. You can roll back the effects with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction. The changes are visible to the current
transaction.

### bdr.drop_replication_set

This function removes an existing replication set.

Replication of this command is affected by DDL replication configuration,
including DDL filtering settings.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.drop_replication_set(set_name name)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` &mdash; Name of an existing replication set.

#### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This means
the replication is affected by the [ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration.

The function takes a `DDL` global lock.

This function is transactional. You can roll back the effects with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction. The changes are visible to the current
transaction.

!!! Warning
    Don't drop a replication set that's being used by at least
    another node, because doing so stops replication on that
    node. If that happens, unsubscribe the affected node
    from that replication set.
    For the same reason, don't drop a replication set with
    a join operation in progress when the node being joined
    is a member of that replication set. Replication set membership is
    checked only at the beginning of the join.
    This happens because the information on replication set usage is
    local to each node, so that you can configure it on a node before
    it joins the group.

You can manage replication set subscription for a node using `alter_node_replication_sets`.

### bdr.alter_node_replication_sets

This function changes the replication sets a node publishes and is subscribed to.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_node_replication_sets(node_name name,
                                set_names text[])
```

#### Parameters

-   `node_name` &mdash; The node to modify. Currently has to be local node.
-   `set_names` &mdash; Array of replication sets to replicate to the specified
    node. An empty array results in the use of the group default replication set.

#### Notes

This function is executed only on the local node and isn't replicated in any manner.

The replication sets listed aren't checked for existence,
since this function is designed to execute before the node joins. Be careful
to specify replication set names correctly to avoid errors.

This allows for calling the function not only on the node that's part of the
BDR group but also on a node that hasn't joined any group yet. This approach limits
the data synchronized during the join. However, the schema is
always fully synchronized without regard to the replication sets setting.
All tables are copied across, not just the ones specified
in the replication set. You can drop unwanted tables by referring to
the `bdr.tables` catalog table. These might be removed automatically in later
versions of BDR. This is currently true even if the [ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration otherwise prevent replication of DDL.

The replication sets that the node subscribes to after this call are published
by the other nodes for actually replicating the changes from those nodes to
the node where this function is executed.

## Replication set membership

You can add tables to or remove them from one or more replication sets. This
affects replication only of changes (DML) in those tables. Schema changes (DDL) are
handled by DDL replication set filters (see [DDL replication filtering](#ddl-replication-filtering)).

The replication uses the table membership in replication sets 
with the node replication sets configuration to determine the actions to
replicate to which node. The decision is done using the union of all the
memberships and replication set options. Suppose that a table is a member
of replication set A that replicates only INSERT actions and replication set B that
replicates only UPDATE actions. Both INSERT and UPDATE act8ions are replicated if the
target node is also subscribed to both replication set A and B.

### bdr.replication_set_add_table

This function adds a table to a replication set.

This adds a table to a replication set and starts replicating changes
from this moment (or rather transaction commit). Any existing data the table
might have on a node isn't synchronized.

Replication of this command is affected by DDL replication configuration,
including DDL filtering settings.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.replication_set_add_table(relation regclass,
                              set_name name DEFAULT NULL,
                              columns text[] DEFAULT NULL,
                              row_filter text DEFAULT NULL)
```

#### Parameters

-   `relation` &mdash; Name or Oid of a table.
-   `set_name` &mdash; Name of the replication set. If NULL (the default), then the BDR
     group default replication set is used.
-   `columns` &mdash; Reserved for future use (currently does nothing and must be NULL).
-   `row_filter` &mdash; SQL expression to be used for filtering the replicated rows.
    If this expression isn't defined (that is, set to NULL, the default) then all rows are sent.

The `row_filter` specifies an expression producing a Boolean result, with NULLs.
Expressions evaluating to True or Unknown replicate the row. A False value
doesn't replicate the row. Expressions can't contain subqueries or refer to
variables other than columns of the current row being replicated. You can't reference system
columns.

`row_filter` executes on the origin node, not on the target node. This puts an
additional CPU overhead on replication for this specific table but
completely avoids sending data for filtered rows. Hence network
bandwidth is reduced and overhead on the target node is applied.

`row_filter` never removes `TRUNCATE` commands for a specific table.
You can filter away `TRUNCATE` commands at the replication set level.

You can replicate just some columns of a table. See
[Replicating between nodes with differences](appusage).

#### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This means
that the replication is affected by the [ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration.

The function takes a `DML` global lock on the relation that's being
added to the replication set if the `row_filter` isn't NULL. Otherwise
it takes just a `DDL` global lock.

This function is transactional. You can roll back the effects with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction. The changes are visible to the current
transaction.

### bdr.replication_set_remove_table

This function removes a table from the replication set.

Replication of this command is affected by DDL replication configuration,
including DDL filtering settings.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.replication_set_remove_table(relation regclass,
                                 set_name name DEFAULT NULL)
```

#### Parameters

-   `relation` &mdash; Name or Oid of a table.
-   `set_name` &mdash; Name of the replication set. If NULL (the default), then the BDR
     group default replication set is used.

#### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This means
the replication is affected by the [ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration.

The function takes a `DDL` global lock.

This function is transactional. You can roll back the effects with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction. The changes are visible to the current
transaction.

## Listing replication sets

You can list existing replication sets with the following query:

```sql
SELECT set_name
FROM bdr.replication_sets;
```

You can use this query to list all the tables in a given replication
set:

```sql
SELECT nspname, relname
FROM bdr.tables
WHERE set_name = 'myrepset';
```

In [Behavior with foreign keys](#behavior-with-foreign-keys), we show a
query that lists all the foreign keys whose referenced table isn't
included in the same replication set as the referencing table.

Use the following SQL to show those replication sets that the
current node publishes and subscribes from:

```sql
 SELECT node_id,
        node_name,
        pub_repsets,
        sub_repsets
   FROM bdr.local_node_summary;
```

This code produces output like this:

```sql
  node_id   | node_name |    pub_repsets     |   sub_repsets
------------+-----------+----------------------------------------
 1834550102 | s01db01   | {bdrglobal,bdrs01} | {bdrglobal,bdrs01}
(1 row)
```

To execute the same query against all nodes in the cluster, you can use the following query. This approach gets
the replication sets associated with all nodes at the same time.

```sql
WITH node_repsets AS (
  SELECT jsonb_array_elements(
    bdr.run_on_all_nodes($$
        SELECT
          node_id,
          node_name,
          pub_repsets,
          sub_repsets
		FROM bdr.local_node_summary;
    $$)::jsonb
  ) AS j
)
SELECT j->'response'->'command_tuples'->0->>'node_id' AS node_id,
       j->'response'->'command_tuples'->0->>'node_name' AS node_name,
       j->'response'->'command_tuples'->0->>'pub_repsets' AS pub_repsets,
       j->'response'->'command_tuples'->0->>'sub_repsets' AS sub_repsets
FROM node_repsets;
```

This shows, for example:

```sql
  node_id   | node_name |    pub_repsets     |    sub_repsets
------------+-----------+----------------------------------------
 933864801  | s02db01   | {bdrglobal,bdrs02} | {bdrglobal,bdrs02}
 1834550102 | s01db01   | {bdrglobal,bdrs01} | {bdrglobal,bdrs01}
 3898940082 | s01db02   | {bdrglobal,bdrs01} | {bdrglobal,bdrs01}
 1102086297 | s02db02   | {bdrglobal,bdrs02} | {bdrglobal,bdrs02}
(4 rows)
```

## DDL replication filtering

By default, the replication of all supported DDL happens by way of the default BDR
group replication set. This is achieved with a DDL filter with
the same name as the BDR group. This filter is added to the default BDR
group replication set when the BDR group is created.

You can adjust this by changing the DDL replication filters for
all existing replication sets. These filters are independent of table
membership in the replication sets. Just like data changes, each DDL statement
is replicated only once, even if it's matched by multiple filters on
multiple replication sets.

You can list existing DDL filters with the following query, which
shows for each filter the regular expression applied to the command
tag and to the role name:

```sql
SELECT * FROM bdr.ddl_replication;
```

You can use the following functions to manipulate DDL filters. 
They are considered to be `DDL` and are therefore subject to DDL
replication and global locking.

### bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter

This function adds a DDL filter to a replication set.

Any DDL that matches the given filter is replicated to any node that's
subscribed to that set. This also affects replication of BDR admin functions.

This doesn't prevent execution of DDL on any node. It only
alters whether DDL is replicated to other nodes. Suppose two nodes have
a replication filter between them that excludes all index commands. Index commands can still 
be executed freely by directly connecting to
each node and executing the desired DDL on that node.

The DDL filter can specify a `command_tag` and `role_name` to allow
replication of only some DDL statements. The `command_tag` is the same as those
used by [EVENT TRIGGERs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/event-trigger-matrix.html)
for regular PostgreSQL commands. A typical example might be to create a
filter that prevents additional index commands on a logical standby from
being replicated to all other nodes.

You can filter the BDR admin functions used by using a tagname matching the
qualified function name. For example, `bdr.replication_set_add_table` is the
command tag for the function of the same name. In this case, this tag allows all BDR
functions to be filtered using `bdr.*`.

The `role_name` is used for matching against the current role that is executing
the command. Both `command_tag` and `role_name` are evaluated as regular
expressions, which are case sensitive.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter(set_name name,
                                   ddl_filter_name text,
                                   command_tag text,
                                   role_name text DEFAULT NULL,
                                   base_relation_name text DEFAULT NULL,
                                   query_match text DEFAULT NULL,
                                   exclusive boolean DEFAULT FALSE)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` &mdash; name of the replication set; if NULL then the BDR
     group default replication set is used
-   `ddl_filter_name` &mdash; name of the DDL filter; this must be unique across the
    whole BDR group
-   `command_tag` &mdash; regular expression for matching command tags; NULL means
    match everything
-   `role_name` &mdash; regular expression for matching role name; NULL means
    match all roles
-   `base_relation_name` &mdash; reserved for future use, must be NULL
-   `query_match` &mdash; regular expression for matching the query; NULL means
    match all queries
-   `exclusive` &mdash; if true, other matched filters are not taken into
    consideration (that is, only the exclusive filter is applied), when multiple
    exclusive filters match, we throw an error. This is useful for routing
    specific commands to specific replication set, while keeping the default
    replication through the main replication set.

#### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This means
that the replication is affected by the [ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration. This also means that replication of changes to ddl
filter configuration is affected by the existing ddl filter configuration.

The function takes a `DDL` global lock.

This function is transactional. You can roll back the effects with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction. The changes are visible to the current
transaction.

To view the defined replication filters, use the view `bdr.ddl_replication`.

#### Examples

To include only BDR admin functions, define a filter like this:

```sql
SELECT bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter('mygroup', 'mygroup_admin', $$bdr\..*$$);
```

To exclude everything apart from index DDL:

```sql
SELECT bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter('mygroup', 'index_filter',
				'^(?!(CREATE INDEX|DROP INDEX|ALTER INDEX)).*');
```

To include all operations on tables and indexes but exclude all others, add
two filters: one for tables, one for indexes. This shows that
multiple filters provide the union of all allowed DDL commands:

```sql
SELECT bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter('bdrgroup','index_filter', '^((?!INDEX).)*$');
SELECT bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter('bdrgroup','table_filter', '^((?!TABLE).)*$');
```

### bdr.replication_set_remove_ddl_filter

This function removes the DDL filter from a replication set.

Replication of this command is affected by DDL replication configuration,
including DDL filtering settings themselves.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.replication_set_remove_ddl_filter(set_name name,
                                      ddl_filter_name text)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` &mdash; Name of the replication set. If NULL then the BDR
     group default replication set is used.
-   `ddl_filter_name` &mdash; Name of the DDL filter to remove.

#### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This
means that the replication is affected by the
[ddl filters](repsets#ddl-replication-filtering) configuration. 
This also means that replication of changes to the DDL filter configuration is
affected by the existing DDL filter configuration.

The function takes a `DDL` global lock.

This function is transactional. You can roll back the effects with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction. The changes are visible to the current
transaction.
