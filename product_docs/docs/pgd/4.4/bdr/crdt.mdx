navTitle: CRDT data types
title: Conflict-free replicated data types


---

Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDT) support merging values
from concurrently modified rows instead of discarding one of the rows as traditional resolution does.

Each CRDT type is implemented as a separate PostgreSQL data type with
an extra callback added to the `bdr.crdt_handlers` catalog. The merge
process happens inside the BDR writer on the apply side without any user
action needed.

CRDTs require the table to have column-level conflict resolution enabled,
as documented in [CLCD](column-level-conflicts).

The only action you need to take is to use a particular data type
in CREATE/ALTER TABLE rather than standard built-in data types such as
integer. For example, consider the following table with one regular integer
counter and a single row:

```
CREATE TABLE non_crdt_example (
    id      integer				PRIMARY KEY,
    counter integer				NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

INSERT INTO non_crdt_example (id) VALUES (1);
```

Suppose you issue the following SQL on two nodes at same time:

```
UPDATE non_crdt_example
   SET counter = counter + 1    -- "reflexive" update
 WHERE id = 1;
```

After both updates are applied, you can see the resulting values using this query:

```
SELECT * FROM non_crdt_example WHERE id = 1;
   id |   counter
 -----+-----------
    1 |         1
(1 row)
```

This code shows that you lost one of the increments due to the `update_if_newer`
conflict resolver. If you use the CRDT counter data type instead,
the result looks like this:

```
CREATE TABLE crdt_example (
    id      integer				PRIMARY KEY,
    counter bdr.crdt_gcounter	NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

ALTER TABLE crdt_example REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;

SELECT bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection('crdt_example',
			'column_modify_timestamp', 'cts');

INSERT INTO crdt_example (id) VALUES (1);
```

Again issue the following SQL on two nodes at same time,
and then wait for the changes to be applied:

```
UPDATE crdt_example
   SET counter = counter + 1    -- "reflexive" update
 WHERE id = 1;

SELECT id, counter FROM crdt_example WHERE id = 1;
   id |   counter
 -----+-----------
    1 |         2
(1 row)
```

This example shows that CRDTs correctly allow accumulator columns to work, even
in the face of asynchronous concurrent updates that otherwise conflict.

The `crdt_gcounter` type is an example of state-based CRDT types that
work only with reflexive UPDATE SQL, such as `x = x + 1`, as the example shows.

The `bdr.crdt_raw_value` configuration option determines whether queries
return the current value or the full internal state of the CRDT type. By
default, only the current numeric value is returned. When set to `true`,
queries return representation of the full state. You can use the special hash operator
(`#`) to request only the current numeric value without using the
special operator (the default behavior). If the full state is
dumped using `bdr.crdt_raw_value = on`, then the value can 
reload only with `bdr.crdt_raw_value = on`.

!!! Note
    The `bdr.crdt_raw_value` applies formatting only of data returned
    to clients, that is, simple column references in the select list. Any column
    references in other parts of the query (such as `WHERE` clause or even
    expressions in the select list) might still require use of the `#` operator.

Another class of CRDT data types is referred to *delta CRDT*
types. These are a special subclass of operation-based CRDTs.

With delta CRDTs, any update to a value is compared to the
previous value on the same node. Then a change is applied as a delta
on all other nodes.

```
CREATE TABLE crdt_delta_example (
    id       integer            PRIMARY KEY,
    counter  bdr.crdt_delta_counter NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

ALTER TABLE crdt_delta_example REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;

SELECT bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection('crdt_delta_example',
			'column_modify_timestamp', 'cts');

INSERT INTO crdt_delta_example (id) VALUES (1);
```

Suppose you issue the following SQL on two nodes at same time:

```
UPDATE crdt_delta_example
   SET counter = 2          -- notice NOT counter = counter + 2
 WHERE id = 1;
```

After both updates are applied, you can see the resulting values using this query:

```
SELECT id, counter FROM crdt_delta_example WHERE id = 1;
   id | counter
 -----+---------
    1 |       4
(1 row)
```

With a regular `integer` column, the result is `2`. But
when you update the row with a delta CRDT counter, you start with the OLD
row version, make a NEW row version, and send both to the remote node.
There, compare them with the version found there (e.g.,
the LOCAL version). Standard CRDTs merge the NEW and the LOCAL version,
while delta CRDTs compare the OLD and NEW versions and apply the delta
to the LOCAL version.

The CRDT types are installed as part of `bdr` into the `bdr` schema.
For convenience, the basic operators (`+`, `#` and `!`) and a number
of common aggregate functions (`min`, `max`, `sum`, and `avg`) are
created in `pg_catalog`. This makes them available without having to tweak
`search_path`.

An important question is how query planning and optimization works with these
new data types. CRDT types are handled transparently. Both `ANALYZE` and
the optimizer work, so estimation and query planning works fine without
having to do anything else.

## State-based and operation-based CRDTs

Following the notation from [1], both operation-based
and state-based CRDTs are implemented.

### Operation-based CRDT types (CmCRDT)

The implementation of operation-based types is trivial because
the operation isn't transferred explicitly but computed from the old
and new row received from the remote node.

Currently, these operation-based CRDTs are implemented:

-   `crdt_delta_counter` &mdash; `bigint` counter (increments/decrements)
-   `crdt_delta_sum` &mdash; `numeric` sum (increments/decrements)

These types leverage existing data types (for example, `crdt_delta_counter` is
a domain on a `bigint`) with a little bit of code to compute the delta.

This approach is possible only for types for which the method for computing
the delta is known, but the result is simple and cheap (both in terms of
space and CPU) and has a couple of additional benefits. For example, it can
leverage operators/syntax for the underlying data type.

The main disadvantage is that you can't reset this value reliably
in an asynchronous and concurrent environment.

!!! Note
    Implementing more complicated operation-based types by
    creating custom data types is possible, storing the state and the last operation. 
    (Every change is decoded and transferred, so multiple
    operations aren't needed). But at that point, the main benefits (simplicity,
    reuse of existing data types) are lost without gaining any advantage compared to
    state-based types (for example, still no capability to reset) except for the
    space requirements. (A per-node state isn't needed.)

### State-based CRDT types (CvCRDT)

State-based types require a more complex internal state and so can't
use the regular data types directly the way operation-based types do.

Currently, four state-based CRDTs are implemented:

-   `crdt_gcounter` &mdash; `bigint` counter (increment-only)
-   `crdt_gsum` &mdash; `numeric` sum/counter (increment-only)
-   `crdt_pncounter` &mdash; `bigint` counter (increments/decrements)
-   `crdt_pnsum` &mdash; `numeric` sum/counter (increments/decrements)

The internal state typically includes per-node information, increasing
the on-disk size but allowing added benefits. The need to implement
custom data types implies more code (in/out functions and operators).

The advantage is the ability to reliably reset the values, a somewhat
self-healing nature in the presence of lost changes (which doesn't
happen in a cluster that operates properly), and the ability to receive changes
from other than source nodes.

Consider, for example, that a value is modified on node A, and the change
gets replicated to B but not C due to network issue between A and C.
If B modifies the value and this change gets replicated to C, it
includes even the original change from A. With operation-based CRDTs,
node C doesn't receive the change until the A-C network connection
starts working again.

The main disadvantages of CvCRDTs are higher costs in terms of
disk space and CPU usage. A bit of information for each node is needed, including nodes
that were already removed from the cluster. The complex nature of
the state (serialized into varlena types) means increased CPU use.

## Disk-space requirements

An important consideration is the overhead associated with CRDT types,
particularly the on-disk size.

For operation-based types, this is trivial, because the types
are merely domains on top of other types and so have the same disk
space requirements no matter how many nodes are there.

-   `crdt_delta_counter` &mdash; Same as `bigint` (8 bytes)
-   `crdt_delta_sum` &mdash; Same as `numeric` (variable, depending on precision
    and scale)

There's no dependency on the number of nodes because operation-based
CRDT types don't store any per-node information.

For state-based types, the situation is more complicated. All the types
are variable-length (stored essentially as a `bytea` column) and consist
of a header and a certain amount of per-node information for each node
that modified the value.

For the `bigint` variants, formulas computing approximate size are (`N`
denotes the number of nodes that modified this value):

-   `crdt_gcounter` &mdash; `32B (header) + N * 12B (per-node)`
-   `crdt_pncounter` -&mdash;`48B (header) + N * 20B (per-node)`

For the `numeric` variants, there's no exact formula because both the
header and per-node parts include `numeric` variable-length values. To
give you an idea of how many such values you need to keep:

-   `crdt_gsum`
    -   fixed: `20B (header) + N * 4B (per-node)`
    -   variable: `(2 + N)` `numeric` values
-   `crdt_pnsum`
    -   fixed: `20B (header) + N * 4B (per-node)`
    -   variable: `(4 + 2 * N)` `numeric` values

!!! Note 
    It doesn't matter how many nodes are in the cluster if the
    values are never updated on multiple nodes. It also doesn't matter whether
    the updates were concurrent (causing a conflict).
    
    In addition, it doesn't matter how many of those nodes were already
    removed from the cluster. There's no way to compact the state yet.

## CRDT types versus conflicts handling

As tables can contain both CRDT and non-CRDT columns (most
columns are expected to be non-CRDT), you need to do both the regular
conflict resolution and CRDT merge.

The conflict resolution happens first and is responsible for deciding
the tuple to keep (applytuple) and the one to discard. The merge
phase happens next, merging data for CRDT columns from the discarded
tuple into the applytuple.

!!! Note
    This handling makes CRDT types somewhat more expensive compared to plain
    conflict resolution because the merge needs to happen every time. This is the case even
    when the conflict resolution can use one of the fast-paths (such as those modified
    in the current transaction).

## CRDT types versus conflict reporting

By default, detected conflicts are individually reported. Without
CRDT types, this makes sense because the conflict resolution
essentially throws away one half of the available information (local or
remote row, depending on configuration). This presents a data loss.

CRDT types allow both parts of the information to be combined
without throwing anything away, eliminating the data loss issue. This makes
the conflict reporting unnecessary.

For this reason, conflict reporting is skipped when the conflict can be
fully resolved by CRDT merge, that is, if each column meets at least one
of these two conditions:

-  The values in local and remote tuple are the same (NULL or equal).
-  It uses a CRDT data type and so can be merged.

!!! Note
    This means that the conflict reporting is also skipped when there are no
    CRDT columns but all values in local/remote tuples are equal.

## Resetting CRDT values

Resetting CRDT values is possible but requires special handling.
The asynchronous nature of the
cluster means that different nodes might see the reset operation at different 
places in the change stream no matter how it's implemented.
Different nodes might also initiate a reset concurrently, that is, before
observing the reset from the other node.

In other words, to make the reset operation behave correctly, it needs to
be commutative with respect to the regular operations. Many naive ways
to reset a value that might work well on a single-node fail
for this reason.

For example, the simplest approach to resetting a value might be:

```
UPDATE crdt_table SET cnt = 0 WHERE id = 1;
```

With state-based CRDTs this doesn't work. It throws away the state for the
other nodes but only locally. It's added back by merge functions
on remote nodes, causing diverging values and eventually receiving it
back due to changes on the other nodes.

With operation-based CRDTs, this might seem to work because the
update is interpreted as a subtraction of `-cnt`. But it works only in the
absence of concurrent resets. Once two nodes attempt to do a reset at
the same time, the delta is applied twice, getting a negative
value (which isn't expected from a reset).

It might also seem that you can use `DELETE + INSERT` as a reset, but this approach
has a couple of weaknesses, too. If the row is reinserted with the same
key, it's not guaranteed that all nodes see it at the same position in
the stream of operations with respect to changes from other nodes.
BDR specifically discourages reusing the same primary key value since
it can lead to data anomalies in concurrent cases.

State-based CRDT types can reliably handle resets
using a special `!` operator like this:

```
UPDATE tab SET counter = !counter WHERE ...;
```

"Reliably" means the values don't have the two issues of multiple concurrent resets and divergence.

Operation-based CRDT types can be reset reliably only using
[Eager Replication](eager), since this avoids multiple concurrent resets.
You can also use Eager Replication to set either kind of CRDT to a specific
value.

## Implemented CRDT data types

Currently, there are six CRDT data types implemented:

-  Grow-only counter and sum
-  Positive-negative counter and sum
-  Delta counter and sum

The counters and sums behave mostly the same, except that the counter types
are integer-based (`bigint`), while the sum types are decimal-based
(`numeric`).

Additional CRDT types, described at [1], might be implemented later.

You can list the currently implemented CRDT data types with the
following query:

```sql
SELECT n.nspname, t.typname
FROM bdr.crdt_handlers c
JOIN (pg_type t JOIN pg_namespace n ON t.typnamespace = n.oid)
  ON t.oid = c.crdt_type_id;
```

### grow-only counter (`crdt_gcounter`)

-   Supports only increments with nonnegative values (`value + int`
    and `counter + bigint` operators).

-   You can obtain the current value of the counter either using `#` operator
    or by casting it to `bigint`.

-   Isn't compatible with simple assignments like `counter = value`
    (which is common pattern when the new value is computed somewhere in
    the application).

-   Allows simple reset of the counter using the `!` operator
    ( `counter = !counter` ).

-   You can inspect the internal state using `crdt_gcounter_to_text`.

```
CREATE TABLE crdt_test (
    id       INT PRIMARY KEY,
    cnt      bdr.crdt_gcounter NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);

INSERT INTO crdt_test VALUES (1, 0);      -- initialized to 0
INSERT INTO crdt_test VALUES (2, 129824); -- initialized to 129824
INSERT INTO crdt_test VALUES (3, -4531);  -- error: negative value

-- enable CLCD on the table
ALTER TABLE crdt_test REPLICA IDENTITY FULL;
SELECT bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection('crdt_test', 'column_modify_timestamp', 'cts');

-- increment counters
UPDATE crdt_test SET cnt = cnt + 1 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE crdt_test SET cnt = cnt + 120 WHERE id = 2;

-- error: minus operator not defined
UPDATE crdt_test SET cnt = cnt - 1 WHERE id = 1;

-- error: increment has to be non-negative
UPDATE crdt_test SET cnt = cnt + (-1) WHERE id = 1;

-- reset counter
UPDATE crdt_test SET cnt = !cnt WHERE id = 1;

-- get current counter value
SELECT id, cnt::bigint, cnt FROM crdt_test;

-- show internal structure of counters
SELECT id, bdr.crdt_gcounter_to_text(cnt) FROM crdt_test;
```

    (which is the common pattern when the new value is computed somewhere in
    the application).

-   Allows simple reset of the sum using the `!` operator (`sum = !sum`).

-   Can inspect internal state using `crdt_gsum_to_text`.

-- increment sum
UPDATE crdt_test SET gsum = gsum + 11.5 WHERE id = 1;
UPDATE crdt_test SET gsum = gsum + 120.33 WHERE id = 2;

-- error: minus operator not defined
UPDATE crdt_test SET gsum = gsum - 15.2 WHERE id = 1;

-- error: increment has to be non-negative
UPDATE crdt_test SET gsum = gsum + (-1.56) WHERE id = 1;

-- reset sum
UPDATE crdt_test SET gsum = !gsum WHERE id = 1;
