EDB Postgres Distributed allows you to choose from several replication configurations based on your consistency, availability, and performance needs:

* Asynchronous
* Synchronous (using `synchronous_standby_names`)
* [Commit at Most Once](/pgd/4/bdr/camo)
* [Eager](/pgd/4/bdr/eager)
* [Group Commit](/pgd/4/bdr/group-commit)


For more information, see [Durability](/pgd/4/bdr/durability).
