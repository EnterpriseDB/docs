The standard way of automatically deploying EDB Postgres Distributed in a self-managed setting is to use EDB's deployment tool: [Trusted Postgres Architect](/tpa/latest/) (TPA). 
This applies to physical and virtual machines, both self-hosted and in the cloud (EC2),

!!! Note Get started with TPA and PGD quickly 

    If you want to experiment with a local deployment as quickly as possible, you can [deploy an EDB Postgres Distributed example cluster on Docker](/pgd/latest/quickstart/quick_start_docker) to configure, provision, and deploy a PGD 5 Always-on cluster on Docker.
    
    If deploying to the cloud is your aim, you can [deploy an EDB Postgres Distributed example cluster on AWS](/pgd/latest/quickstart/quick_start_aws) to get a PGD 5 cluster on your own Amazon account.

    If you want to run on your own Linux systems or VMs, you can also use TPA to [deploy EDB Postgres Distributed directly to your own Linux hosts](/pgd/latest/quickstart/quick_start_linux).

## Prerequisite: Install TPA

Before you can use TPA to deploy PGD, you must install TPA. Follow the [installation instructions in the Trusted Postgres Architect documentation](/tpa/latest/INSTALL/) before continuing.


At the highest level, using TPA to deploy PGD involves the following steps:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1: [Use TPA to create a configuration](01-configuring) for your PGD cluster.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2: [Provision, deploy, and test](02-deploying) your PGD cluster.
