intro: |
 EDB Postgres Distributed 5.7.0 includes a number of enhancements and bug fixes.
highlights: |
  - **Improved 3rd Party CDC Tool Integration**: PGD 5.7.0 now supports [failover of logical slots used by CDC tools](/pgd/latest/cdc-failover) with standard plugins (such as test_decoding, pgoutput, and wal2json) within a PGD cluster. This enhancement eliminates the need for 3rd party subscribers to reseed their tables during a lead Primary change.
  - **PGD Compatibility Assessment**: Ensure a seamless migration to PGD with the new [Assess](/pgd/latest/cli/command_ref/assess/) command in the PGD CLI. This tool proactively reports any PostgreSQL incompatibilities—especially those affecting logical replication—so you can address them before upgrading to PGD.
  - **Upgrade PGD and Postgres with a Single Command**: Leverage the new [`pgd node upgrade`](/pgd/latest/cli/command_ref/node/upgrade
  ) command in the PGD CLI to upgrade a node to the latest versions of PGD and Postgres.
  - **Ubuntu 24.04 supported**: PGD 5.7.0 now supports Ubuntu 24.04. (23 March 2025)
relnotes:
- relnote: Improved performance of DML and other operations on partitioned tables.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    Many code paths touching partitioned tables were performing costly checks to support additional table access methods. This code was adjusted to make the most common case (heap) the fastest.
  jira: BDR-5860
  addresses: ""
  type: Enhancement
  impact: Medium
- relnote: Unsupported `ALTER TABLE` command on materialized views is no longer replicated.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    Replication no longer becomes stuck when the command is issued.
  jira: BDR-5997
  addresses: ""
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: Lowest
- relnote: Improved PostgreSQL 17 compatibility.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    Internal tables managed by autopartition that were created before the upgrade to PG17 were missing a `rowtype` entry into `pg_depend`. This issue caused errors after upgrading to PG17.
  jira: BDR-5893
  addresses: 44401
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: Medium
- relnote: Removed redundant `WARNING` when executing `ALTER SEQUENCE`.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    The message now only appears when creating the sequence.
  jira: BDR-6066
  addresses: ""
  type: Enhancement
  impact: Lowest
- relnote: Fixed a server panic by ensuring that catalog lookups aren't performed in a callback that gets called very late in the commit cycle.
  component: BDR
  jira: BDR-5832
  addresses: ""
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: High
- relnote: Fixed an unintentional timed wait for a synchronous logical replication that resulted in unusually high latency for some transactions.
  component: BDR
  jira: BDR-5809
  addresses: 42273
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: High
- relnote: Added support for failover slots for logical replication.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    When a PGD node fails or becomes unavailable, consumers can now continue to consume changes from some other node in the cluster. The feature can be turned on by setting the top group option `failover_slot_scope` to `global`. The consumer needs to handle duplicate transactions, but PGD
    guarantees that every transaction is decoded and sent at least once.
  jira: BDR-5673, BDR-5925
  addresses: ""
  type: Feature
  impact: High
- relnote: Ensured that the `remote_commit_time` and `remote_commit_lsn` are properly reported in the conflict reports.
  component: BDR
  jira: BDR-5808
  addresses: 42273
  type: Feature
  impact: High
- relnote: Fixed an issue whereby concurrent joins of subscriber-only nodes occasionally stopped responding.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    A node could end up waiting for the local state of another concurrently joined node to advance, which caused the system to stop responding.
  jira: BDR-5789
  addresses: 42964
  type: Feature
  impact: Medium
- relnote: Fixed a bug where parting stopped responding with consensus timeout or consensus errors.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    This fix also ensures parting doesn't stop responding when any of the nodes restart when part is in progress. Origin LSNs don't show up as 0/0 in log messages.
  jira: BDR-5777
  addresses: 42056
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: Medium
- relnote: Fixed a memory leak in a global hook.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    This bug could cause memory to leak even if `bdr.so` is just loaded and the extension isn't installed.
  jira: BDR-5821
  addresses: 43678
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: Medium
- relnote: Fixed a bug where subgroup member part prevented new nodes from joining.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    This fix ensures that if a subgroup member is parted while Raft subgroup routing is active, then another node can subsequently join that subgroup.
  jira: BDR-5781
  addresses: ""
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: Medium
- relnote: Fixed a case where galloc sequence overflow wasn't being caught correctly.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    This bug resulted in `nextval` call being stuck.
  jira: BDR-5930
  addresses: 44755
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: Medium
- relnote: Fixed group slot movement for witness and data nodes in presence of subscriber-only nodes and witness nodes.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    For PGD 5.6.0 and later, there are no subscriptions from a subscriber-only node to a witness node. This caused a problem with movement of group slot on data nodes and witness nodes in the presence of subscriber-only nodes in the cluster. This bug could cause WAL to be held on both witness nodes and data nodes when there's a subscriber-only node in the cluster.

- relnote: Improved `bdr_init_physical` to be able to run without superuser.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    Now only the `bdr_superuser` is required.
  jira: BDR-5231

- relnote: Fixed a bug where conflict resolution functions were executed also on the witness nodes.
  component: BDR
  jira: BDR-5807
  addresses: ""
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: Medium
- relnote: Fixed a bug to handle additional replication sets on witness nodes.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    The witness node now only cares about the top replication set and thus allows it to miss replications sets and not error out.

- relnote: Narrowed down `bdr.node_slots` output to list only relevant slots.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    The slots are displayed based on the node type, its role, and the cluster topology.
  jira: BDR-5253
  addresses: ""
  type: Enhancement

  addresses: ""
  type: Enhancement
  impact: High
- relnote: Fixed a bug where `bdr_init_physical` stopped responding when `synchronous_commit` is set to `remote_write/remote_apply`.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    `bdr_init_physical` disables synchronous replication on a new node by resetting `synchronous_standby_names` to an empty string. A warning message reminds you to set `synchronous_standby_names` as needed.
  jira: BDR-5918
  addresses: 44760
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: Medium
- relnote: Added a GUC to support upgrade to 5.7.0 for clusters with optimized topology (a preview feature).
  component: BDR
  details: |
    An upgrade to 5.7.0 from clusters that have `bdr.force_full_mesh` set to `off` to enable optimized topology
    (a preview feature) must first set this GUC to `on` and then upgrade. After the entire cluster upgrades,
    this GUC can be set to `off` again to enable optimized topology.
    Having this GUC set to `off` during upgrade isn't supported.
  jira: BDR-5872
  addresses: ""
  type: Other
  impact: Low
- relnote: Changed origin deletion to be done asynchronously when optimized topology is enabled.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    In an optimized topology, origin names now use the generation ID of the node. This fixes an inconsistency in which some transactions can be lost or sent twice when a node is parted.
  jira: BDR-5872
  addresses: ""
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: Low
- relnote: Fixed a crash during upgrades in a mixed-version cluster.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    Upgrading from versions earlier than 5.6.0 to 5.6.0 and later in a mixed-version cluster with a standby or a node joining/parting could cause a crash.

- relnote: Added new CLI command structure for easier access.
  component: PGD CLI
  details: |
    The new CLI command structure is more intuitive and easier to use. The new structure is a "noun-verb" format, where the noun is the object you want to work with and the verb is the action you want to perform.
