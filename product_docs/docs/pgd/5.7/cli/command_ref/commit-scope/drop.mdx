## Synopsis

The `pgd commit-scope drop` command is used to drop a commit scope from the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

## Syntax

```plaintext
pgd commit-scope <COMMIT_SCOPE> drop [OPTIONS] [GROUP_NAME]
```

Where `<COMMIT_SCOPE>` is the name of the commit scope to drop.

The optional `[GROUP_NAME]` is the name of the group to which the commit scope belongs. If omitted, it defaults to the top-level group. Note that the name of the group must match the group name the commit scope was created with.

## Options
