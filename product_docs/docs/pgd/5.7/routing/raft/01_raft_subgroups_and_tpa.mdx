title: "Creating Raft subgroups using TPA"
---

The `TPAexec configure` command enables Raft subgroups if the `--enable_proxy_routing local` option is set. TPA uses the term *locations* to reflect the common use case of subgroups that map to physical/regional domains. When the configuration is generated, the location name given is stored under the generated group name, which is based on the location name.

## Creating Raft subgroups using TPA

This example creates a two-location cluster with three data nodes in each location. The nodes in each location are part of a PGD Raft subgroup for the location. 

The top-level group's name is `pgdgroup`.

The top-level group has two locations: `us_east` and `us_west`. These locations are mapped to two subgroups: `us_east_subgroup` and `us_west_subgroup`.

Each location has four nodes: three data nodes and a barman backup node. The three data nodes also cohost PGD Proxy. The configuration can be visualized like this:

![6 Node Cluster with 2 Raft Subgroups](images/Tmp6NodeRaftSubgroups.png)

The barman nodes don't participate in the subgroup and, by extension, the Raft group. They're therefore not shown. This diagram is a snapshot of a potential state of the cluster with the West Raft group having selected west_1 as write leader and west_2 as its own Raft leader. On the East, east_1 is write leader while east_3 is Raft leader. The entire cluster is contained within the top-level Raft group. There, west_3 is currently Raft leader.

To create this configuration, you run:

```
tpaexec configure pgdgroup --architecture PGD-Always-ON --location-names us_east us_west --data-nodes-per-location 3 --epas 16 --no-redwood --enable_proxy_routing local --hostnames-from hostnames.txt 
```

Where `hostnames.txt` contains:

```
east1
east2
east3
eastbarman
west1
west2
west3
westbarman
```

## The configuration file

The generated `config.yml` file has a `bdr_node_groups` section that contains the top-level group `pgdgroup` and the two subgroups `us_east_subgroup` and `us_west_subgroup`. Each of those subgroups has a location set (`us_east` and `us_west`) and two other options that are set to true: 

- `enable_raft`, which activates the subgroup Raft in the subgroup
- `enable_proxy_routing`, which enables the pgd_proxy routers to route traffic to the subgroupâ€™s write leader

Here's an example generated by the sample tpaexec command:


```
cluster_vars:
  apt_repository_list: []
  bdr_database: bdrdb
  bdr_node_group: pgdgroup
  bdr_node_groups:
  - name: pgdgroup
  - name: us_east_subgroup
    options:
      enable_proxy_routing: true
      enable_raft: true
      location: us_east
    parent_group_name: pgdgroup
  - name: us_west_subgroup
    options:
      enable_proxy_routing: true
      enable_raft: true
      location: us_west
    parent_group_name: pgdgroup
  bdr_version: '5'
```

Every node instance has an entry in the instances list. In that entry, `bdr_child_group` appears in the variables section, set to the subgroup the node belongs to. Here's an example generated by the sample tpaexec command:

```
instances:
- Name: east1
  backup: eastbarman
  location: us_east
  node: 1
  role:
  - bdr
  - pgd-proxy
  vars:
    bdr_child_group: us_east_subgroup
    bdr_node_options:
      route_priority: 100
- Name: east2
  location: us_east
  node: 2
  role:
  - bdr
  - pgd-proxy
  vars:
    bdr_child_group: us_east_subgroup
    bdr_node_options:
      route_priority: 100
- Name: east3
  location: us_east
  node: 3
  role:
  - bdr
  - pgd-proxy
  vars:
    bdr_child_group: us_east_subgroup
    bdr_node_options:
      route_priority: 100
- Name: eastbarman
  location: us_east
  node: 4
  role:
  - barman
```

The one node in this location that doesn't have a `bdr_child_group` setting is the barman node because it doesn't participate in the Raft decision-making process.
