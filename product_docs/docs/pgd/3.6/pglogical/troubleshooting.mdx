The main tool for troubleshooting is the PostgreSQL log file.

On the upstream side, monitoring uses the views:

```sql
pg_catalog.pg_replication_slots
pg_catalog.pg_stat_replication
```

On the subscriber side there are numerous helper functions and views that may
be consulted to gain insight into pglogical's configuration and behaviour.

Start with the configuration and status summary views:

Configuration can be fetched from:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pglogical.subscriptions;
SELECT * FROM pglogical.TABLES;
SELECT * FROM pglogical.SEQUENCES;
SELECT * FROM pglogical.DDL_REPLICATION;
```

Observe worker activity with:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pglogical.workers;
SELECT * FROM pglogical.worker_error_summary;
SELECT * FROM pglogical.apply_log;
SELECT * FROM pglogical.apply_log_summary;
SELECT * FROM pglogical.worker_locks;
```

Statistics are reported by:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pglogical.stat_relation;
SELECT * FROM pglogical.stat_subscription;
```

Other views provide logs and details:

```sql
SELECT * FROM pglogical.local_sync_status;
SELECT * FROM pglogical.show_subscription_status();
SELECT * FROM pglogical.sub_history;
SELECT * FROM pglogical.worker_error;
SELECT * FROM pglogical.show_workers();
SELECT * FROM pglogical.worker_tasks;

SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_stat_activity;
SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_locks;
SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_replication_origin_status;
```

The relation `pglogical.worker_error_summary` is particularly important for
getting a quick overview of recent problems, though the logs should generally
be your main reference.

## `pglogical.worker_error` and `pglogical.worker_error_summary`

These relations show the last error reported by each kind of pglogical worker.
Only the most recent error is retained for each distinct worker task. Receiver
workers are tracked separately to their writer(s), as are any writer(s) used
for table (re)sync purposes.

walsender workers cannot record errors in `pglogical.worker_error`. Their
errors are only available in the log files.

`pglogical.worker_error_summary` is a convenience view over
`pglogical.worker_error` available in 3.7 and above.

## `pglogical.worker_tasks`

The `pglogical.worker_tasks` view shows pglogical's current worker launch rate
limiting state as well as some basic statistics on background worker launch
and registration activity.

Unlike the other views listed here, it is not specific to the current database
and pglogical node; state for all pglogical nodes on the current PostgreSQL
instance is shown. Join on the current database to filter it.

`pglogical.worker_tasks` does not track walsenders and output plugins.

See the configuration option
[`pglogical.min_worker_backoff_delay`](configuration#pglogical.min_worker_backoff_delay) for
rate limit settings and overrides.

## `pglogical.apply_log` and `pglogical.apply_log_summary`

The `pglogical.apply_log_summary` view summarizes the record of apply worker
events kept in `pglogical.apply_log`. This records human-readable information
about conflicts and errors that arose during apply.

## `pglogical.sub_log`

The `pglogical.sub_log` table contains *conflict log filter definitions* that
are applied when recording entries in `pglogical.apply_log`, controlling
whether conflicts are recorded to a log table and/or postgres log, or silently
dropped. It's managed by `pglogical.alter_subscription_add_log(...)` and
`pglogical.alter_subscription_remove_log()`.

If you aren't seeing expected conflict information when debugging an issue, check
to make sure you have not filtered it out.

When pglogical workers encounter an error condition during operation they
report the error to the PostgreSQL log file, record the error to the
`pglogical.worker_error` table if possible, and exit.

Unlike normal PostgreSQL user backends they do not attempt to recover from most
errors and resume normal operation. Instead the worker in question will be
relaunched soon and will resume operations at the last recoverable point.
In the case of apply workers and walsenders that generally means restarting the
last uncommitted transaction from the beginning.

This is an intentional design choice to make error handling and recovery
simpler and more robust.

For example, if an apply worker tries to apply an `UPDATE` and the new row
violates a secondary unique constraint on the target table, the apply worker
will report the unique violation error and exit. The error information will be
visible in `pglogical.worker_error_summary` (3.7+, `pglogical.worker_error` on 3.6).
The walsender worker on the peer end will exit automatically as well. The apply
worker will be relaunched by the manager worker for the database in a few
seconds and will retry the failed transaction from the beginning. If the
conflicting row has since been removed the transaction will apply normally and
replication will resume. If not, the worker will error again and the cycle will
repeat until the cause of the error is fixed. In this case the fix would
typically be for another subscription or a local application write to replicate
a change that clears the unhandled conflict condition or for the administrator
to intervene to change the conflicting row.

## Diagnosing and fixing errors

It's important to first check that your schema and deployment don't violate any
of the [restrictions](restrictions) imposed by pglogical. Also check the
additional writer-specific restrictions from the pglogical writer you are using,
most likely the [HeapWriter](pglogical-writer#Restrictions).

### Common problems

Some issues that arise when operating pglogical include:

-   Incorrect or changed provider address or hostname. Update the interface definition
    for the subscription.

    Use `pglogical.alter_node_add_interface(...)` and
    `pglogical.alter_subscription_interface(...)` to change the subscriber's
    recorded address for the provider.

-   Incorrect `pg_hba.conf` on provider disallowing subscriber from connecting.
    The subscriber must be able to connect in both replication and ordinary
    non-replication mode.

    Correct the `pg_hba.conf` on the provider and `SELECT pg_reload_conf();` on
    the provider.

-   Incompatible schema definitions on provider and subscriber caused by schema changes
    being made without [DDL replication](ddl) enabled and without use of
    `pglogical.replicate_ddl_command`. For example, missing columns on subscriber
    that haven't been excluded by a column filter, differing data types for columns
    between provider and subscriber, etc.

    (Some data type differences are actually permitted, but care must be taken
    that the text representations are compatible. Do not use differing data types
    for PostgreSQL built-in data types. See [restrictions](restrictions).)

-   Incorrectly defined `ENABLE REPLICA` or `ENABLE ALWAYS` triggers firing on
    apply on the subscriber and causing errors.

-   Heap writers configured to fire normal triggers and foreign key validation
    triggers (using writer option `config.session_replication_role`). Problems
    arise when not all triggers have been checked to ensure they'll work
    correctly with row-replication and without statement triggers being fired as
    well. Or when FK violations or check constraint violations are created by
    replication set configuration such as row and column filters or by referenced
    tables not being replicated along with the referencing tables.

-   Inconsistent versions of PostgreSQL or extensions between provider and subscriber
    where the version difference affects the behaviour or limits of a data type being
    replicated.

    pglogical explicitly supports replicating between different versions of
    PostgreSQL, so a version difference alone is not a problem. But the data
    being replicated must be valid on the subscriber's PostgreSQL version.

    For example, apply errors may occur when replicating data from PostGIS 3.0 to
    PostGIS 2.5 where not all the 3.0 data is understood by 2.5. Similarly,
    replicating from a PostgreSQL configured without integer datetimes to one
    with integer datetimes may result in errors if there are non-integer
    datetimes with values outside the somewhat narrower range permitted by
    integer datetimes support.

### Multiple data source issues

Additional classes of error tend to arise with any sort of multiple-data-source
configuration, i.e. multiple subscriptions to different providers for the same
tables and/or local writes to tables that are also part of a subscription. Some of
these affect BDR3 as well.

These include:

-   Tables with multiple unique constraints may cause unique violation errors
    during apply if the table receives writes from multiple sources.

-   Updating the PRIMARY KEY value for rows, or deleting a key then inserting the same
    key again soon afterwards. This may cause unique violation errors during apply
    if the table receives writes from more than one source, i.e. multiple providers
    and/or local writes.
