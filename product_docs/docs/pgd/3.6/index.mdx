EDB Postgres Distributed provides loosely-coupled multi-master logical replication
using a mesh topology. This means that you can write to any server and the
changes are sent directly, row-by-row to all the
other servers that are part of the same mesh.

EDB Postgres Distributed consists of several components that make the whole
cluster work.

## Postgres server

Two different Postgres distributions can be used:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - open source
- [EDB Postgres Extended Server](https://techsupport.enterprisedb.com/customer_portal/sw/2ndqpostgres/) - PostgreSQL compatible and optimized for replication

What Postgres distribution and version is right for you depends on the features you need.
See the feature matrix in [Choosing a Postgres distribution](/pgd/latest/choosing_server/) for detailed comparison.


## BDR

A Postgres server with the BDR extension installed is referred to as a BDR
node. BDR nodes can be either data nodes or witness nodes.

Witness nodes don't participate in data replication and are only used as a
tie-breaker for consensus.

Available as two editions, BDR Standard provides essential multi-master replication capabilities for delivering row level consistency to address high availability and/or geographically distributed workloads. BDR Enterprise adds advanced conflict-handling and data-loss protection capabilities.

### BDR Enterprise

To provide very high availability, avoid data conflicts, and to cope with more advanced usage scenarios, the Enterprise edition provides the following extensive additional features:

* Eager replication provides conflict free replication by synchronizing across cluster nodes before committing a transaction
* Commit at most once consistency guards application transactions even in the presence of node failures
* Conflict-free replicated data types (CRDTs) provide mathematically proven consistency in asynchronous multi-master update scenarios
* Column level conflict resolution enables per column last-update wins resolution to merge updates
* Transform triggers execute on incoming data for modifying or advanced programmatic filtering
* Conflict triggers provide custom resolution techniques when a conflict is detected

BDR Enterprise requires EDB Postgres Extended v11 (formerly known as 2ndQuadrant Postgres) which is SQL and on-disk compatible with PostgreSQL.

### BDR Standard

The Standard edition provides loosely-coupled multi-master logical replication using a mesh topology. This means that you can write to any node and the changes will be sent directly, row-by-row to all the other nodes that are part of the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

By default BDR uses asynchronous replication to provide row-level eventual consistency, applying changes on the peer nodes only after the local commit.

The following are included to support very high availability and geographically distributed workloads:

* Rolling application and database upgrades to address the largest source of downtime
* DDL replication supports changes to application schema, ideal for use in continuous release environments
* Sequence handling provides applications different options for generating unique surrogate ids that a multi-node aware
* Tools to assess applications, monitor operation, and verify data consistency

BDR Standard requires PostgreSQL v10 or v11.

## pglogical 3.6

BDR depends on the pglogical 3 extension to provide the replication
channel upon which BDR builds.
