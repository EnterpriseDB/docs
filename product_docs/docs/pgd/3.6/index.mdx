title: "EDB Postgres Distributed"
---

EDB Postgres Distributed provides loosely-coupled multi-master logical replication
using a mesh topology. This means that you can write to any server and the
changes are sent directly, row-by-row to all the
other servers that are part of the same mesh.

EDB Postgres Distributed consists of several components that make the whole
cluster work.

## Postgres server

Two different Postgres distributions can be used:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - open source
- [EDB Postgres Extended Server](https://techsupport.enterprisedb.com/customer_portal/sw/2ndqpostgres/) - PostgreSQL compatible and optimized for replication

What Postgres distribution and version is right for you depends on the features you need.
See the feature matrix in [Choosing a Postgres distribution](/pgd/latest/choosing_server) for detailed comparison.


## [BDR](bdr)

A Postgres server with the [BDR](bdr) extension installed is referred to as a BDR
node. BDR nodes can be either data nodes or witness nodes.

Witness nodes don't participate in data replication and are only used as a
tie-breaker for consensus.


## [pglogical 3](pglogical)

BDR depends on [pglogical3](pglogical) to provide the replication
channel upon which BDR builds.
