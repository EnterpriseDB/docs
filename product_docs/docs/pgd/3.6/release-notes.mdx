## BDR 3.6.33 (2022 Nov 16)

This is a maintenance release for BDR 3.6 which includes
fixes for issues identified previously.

### Resolved Issues

- Fix bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection() (BDR-2650)  
  Correct the function to use the 'detector_args' argument.

### Upgrades

This release supports upgrading from the following versions of BDR:

 - 3.6.20 and higher

## BDR 3.6.2 (2022 Aug 23)

This is a maintenance release for BDR 3.6 which includes fixes for issues identified previously.

### Resolved Issues
- Catchup replication slot cleanup during PARTing of a node (BDR-2368, RT82884)<br />
  When parting a node, the catcup replication slot may be left behind if the source node used for catching up changes. Clean up these replication slots once the catchup finishes. Similarly clean up the catchup information from BDR catalogs.

- Cleanup replication slot when bdr_init_physical fails (BDR-2364, RT74789)<br />
  If `bdr_init_physical` aborts without being able to join the node, it will leave behind an inactive replication slot. Remove such a replication slot when it is inactive before an irregular exit.

### Improvements
- Allow consumption of the reserved galloc sequence slot (BDR-2367, RT83437, RT68255)<br />
  The galloc sequence slot reserved for future use by background allocator can be consumed in the presence of consensus failure.

### Upgrades
This release supports upgrading from the following versions of BDR:

- 3.6.20 and higher

## BDR 3.6.31 (2022 May 17)

This is a maintenance release for BDR 3.6 which includes fixes for issues identified previously.

### Resolved Issues
- Make ALTER TABLE lock the underlying relation only once (RT80204)<br />
  This avoids the ALTER TABLE operation falling behind in the queue when it released the lock in between internal operations. With this fix, concurrent transactions trying to acquire the same lock after the ALTER TABLE command will properly wait for the ALTER TABLE to finish.

- Reduce log for `bdr.run_on_all_nodes` (BDR-2153, RT80973)<br />
  Don't log when setting `bdr.ddl_replication` to off if it's done with the "run_on_all_nodes" variants of function. This eliminates the flood of logs for monitoring functions.

### Improvements
- Use 64 bits for calculating lag size in bytes (BDR-2215)

### Upgrades
This release supports upgrading from the following versions of BDR:

- 3.6.20 and higher

## BDR 3.6.30 (2022 Feb 15)

This is a maintenance release for BDR 3.6 which includes fixes for issues identified previously.

### Resolved Issues
- Ensure loss of CAMO partner connectivity switches to Local Mode immediately<br />
  This prevents disconnected partner from being reported as CAMO ready.

- Fix the cleanup of bdr.node_pre_commit for async CAMO configurations (BDR-1808)<br />
  Previously, the periodic cleanup of commit decisions on the CAMO partner checked the readiness of it's partner, rather than the origin node. This is the same node for symmetric CAMO configurations, so those were not affected. This release corrects the check for asymmetric CAMO pairings.

### Upgrades
This release supports upgrading from the following versions of BDR:

- 3.6.20 and higher

## BDR 3.6.29 (2021 Dec 14)

This is a maintenance release for BDR 3.6 which includes fixes for issues identified previously.

### Resolved Issues
- Switch from CAMO to Local Mode only after timeouts (EE, RT74892)<br />
  Do not use the `catchup_interval` estimate when switching from CAMO protected to Local Mode, as that could induce inadvertent switching due to load spikes. Use the estimate only when switching from Local Mode back to CAMO protected (to prevent toggling forth and back due to lag on the CAMO partner).

- Prevent duplicate values generated locally by galloc sequence in high concurrency situations when the new chunk is used (RT76528)<br />
  The galloc sequence could have temporarily produce duplicate value when switching which chunk is used locally (but not across nodes) if there were multiple sessions waiting for the new value. This is now fixed.

- Ensure that the group slot is moved forward when there is only one node in the BDR group<br />
  This prevents disk exhaustion due to WAL accumulation when the group is left running with just single BDR node for prolonged period of time. This is not recommended setup but the WAL accumulation was not intentional.

- Advance Raft protocol version when there is only one node in the BDR group<br />
  Single node clusters would otherwise always stay on oldest support protocol until another node was added. This could limit available feature set on that single node.

### Improvements
- Reduce frequency of CAMO partner connection attempts (EE)<br />
  In case of a failure to connect to a CAMO partner do not retry immediately (leading to a fully busy pglogical manager process), but throttle down repeated attempts to reconnect to once per minute.

- Ensure CAMO configuration is checked again after a reconnect (EE)

### Upgrades
This release supports upgrading from following versions of BDR:

- 3.6.20 and higher

## BDR 3.6.28.1 (2021 Nov 19)

This is a security and maintenance release for BDR 3.6 which includes fixes for issues identified previously.

Please make sure you read the pglogical 3.6.28 release notes for the important security and physical promotion data loss fixes provided there.

### Resolved Issues
- Ensure `bdr.camo_local_mode`_delay is actually being applied (BDR-803)<br />
  This artificial delay allows throttling a CAMO node that is not currently connected to its CAMO partner to prevent it from producing transactions faster than the CAMO partner can possibly apply. In previous versions, it did not properly kick in after `bdr.global_commit_timeout` amount of lag, but only 1000 times later (due to erroneously comparing seconds to milliseconds).

- Fix potential FATAL error when using global DML locking with CAMO (BDR-1675, BDR-1655)

- Fix lag calculation for CAMO local mode delay (BDR-1681)<br />
  The lag calculation could have easily overflowed causing the CAMO to behave wrongly on partner disconnect.

- Fix `bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind` to accept a bigint as a start value (RT74294)<br />
  The function was casting the value to an int thus getting bogus values when bigint was used.

- Fix node replication slot handling on node name reuse (RT71888)<br />
  Cleanup local info slot name when the slot is dropped, this will prevent data loss by not dropping the slot during `bdr_init_physical` when it joins a node re-using the same name.

- Don't stop consensus worker when manager exists (RT73539)<br />
  Killing the consensus after configuration changes would destabilize Raft.

- Fix ignored `--recovery-conf` option in `bdr_init_physical`.<br />
  `bdr_init_physical` was completely ignoring the value of the `--recovery-conf` option if provided. It would append to a `recovery.conf` if one already existed in the target data dir but totally ignored the supplementary config provided on the command line, if any.

### Improvements
- Allow user to specify a different `postgres.auto.conf` file. (BDR-1400)<br />
  Added command-line argument `--postgresql-auto-conf` to be used when the user needs to specify a different `postgres.auto.conf` file.

- Log LSN when advancing replication origin during join
  Make `bdr_process_node_state_join_start()` log the LSN it advances the replication origin for the catchup join-target node to when BDR is started by `bdr_init_physical` with a `bdr.init_physical_lsn` set. This is critical information for diagnosing issues with physical join.

- Replication slot monitoring improvements (BDR-720)
  - Differentiate decoder slot in `bdr.node_slots`.

  - Include node and group information in `bdr.node_slots` when origin and target are in different node group.
  - Teach `bdr.monitor_local_replslots` what slots to expect.

- Improve documentation of the backup/restore procedure (RT72503, BDR-1340)<br />    Recommend against dropping the extension with cascade because it may drop user columns that are using CRDT types and break the sequences. It's better do use `drop_node` function instead.

### Upgrades
This release supports upgrading from following versions of BDR:

- 3.6.20 and higher

## BDR 3.6.27 (2021 Aug 12)

This is a security and maintenance release for BDR 3.6 which includes fixes for issues identified previously.

Please make sure you read the pglogical 3.6.27 release notes for the important security and physical promotion data loss fixes provided there.

### Resolved Issues
- Make sure `bdr_init_physical` does not leave temporary replication slots behind (BDR-191, RT70355)<br />
  We now use native temporary slots in PostgreSQL which are automatically cleaned up.

- Make the consensus worker exit if postmaster dies (BDR1063, RT70024)<br />
  This solves issues with consensus worker hanging after crash of other PostgreSQL process.

- Fix reuse of internal connection pool connections<br />
  Improves behavior with larger number of nodes.

### Upgrades
This release supports upgrading from following versions of BDR:

- 3.6.20 and higher

## BDR 3.6.26 (2021 May 13)

This is a security and maintenance release for BDR 3.6 which includes fixes for issues identified previously.

Please make sure you read the pglogical 3.6.26 release notes for the important security and physical promotion data loss fixes provided there.

### Resolved Issues
- Fix crash in `bdr.run_on_all_nodes` when remote node returned an error

### Other Changes
- Add `bdr.alter_subscription_skip_changes_upto()` (BDR-195)<br />
  This function allows moving subscription ahead without replicating the changes which is useful for error recovery.

- Add a new documentation appendix which shows example of how to do table rewriting DDL safely with BDR (RTRT69514, RT69340).

- Improve coexistence with BDR 3.7 in the same BDR group (during upgrades).

### Upgrades
This release supports upgrading from following versions of BDR:

- 3.6.20 and higher

## BDR 3.6.25 (2021 Feb 11)

This is a security and maintenance release for BDR 3.6 which includes fixes for issues identified previously.

### Resolved Issues
- Don't display additional node connection string in `node_summary` and `local_node_summary` views (RT69564)<br />
  BDR only supports one connection string for each node.

- Fix "bdr node ... not found" in replay progress update (RT69779)<br />
  Nodes that have pending progress info globally might no longer exist locally, and if that's the case is safe to ignore the progress update for them.

- Update state journal on node creation (RM20111)<br />
  This solves corner cases where we could sometimes fail to join or part a node if the node with same name previously existed and was removed.

- Fix issues with stopping supervisor process when blocked by network call (RM20311)<br />
  This issue could have resulted in PostgreSQL refusing to stop if the supervisor process was stuck on a network call.

### Improvements
- Add new param detector_args to `bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection` (RT69677)<br />
  To allow additional parameters for individual detectors.

- Currently the only additional parameter is `atttype` for the `row_version` detection method which allows using `smallint` and `bigint`, rather than just the default integer for the column type.

### Upgrades
This release supports upgrading from following versions of BDR:

- 3.6.20 and higher

## BDR 3.6.24 (2020 Dec 03)

This is a security and maintenance release for BDR 3.6 which includes fixes for issues identified previously.

### Resolved Issues

- Unblock replay progress updates after a failing CAMO connection (EE) (RT69493, RM19924)<br />
  After a connection to the configured CAMO partner (or origin) failed, for example if the CAMO partner simply has not been started at the start of the origin node, it was not properly reset. This not only prevented further connection attempts and prevented CAMO from operating, but also blocked replay progress updates from the blocked node. Which in turn prevents the group slot from advancing, meaning WAL data piled up on all nodes.

- This release not only corrects the cleanup of the CAMO connection state to enable retries, but also decouples replay progress updates from the CAMO connection. Should there ever be another issue with CAMO connections, replay progress updates and the group slot should not be affected.

- Ensure bdr_init_physical works on matching BDR versions (RT69520, RM19975)<br />
To initialize a new node from a physical copy, the new node must use the same BDR version as the node the physical backup was copied from. This release ensures bdr_init_physical checks and gives a useful error otherwise.

- Relax the safety checks in bdr.drop_node a bit again (RT69639)<br />
  The check to prevent premature removal introduced in 3.6.23 turned out to be too strict and prevented dropping nodes as soon as any one peer had properly dropped the node already. This release relaxes the check again to allow dropping on all peer nodes.

### Improvements

- Local node information in `bdr.node_summary` (RM20002, RT69541) <br />
  Allow user to see information related to the local node even before the node is part of a `node_group`. This extends also to the `bdr.local_node_summary` view.

### Upgrades
This release supports upgrading from following versions of BDR:

- 3.6.20 and higher

## BDR 3.6.23 (2020 Nov 12)

This is a security and maintenance release for BDR 3.6 which includes fixes for issues identified previously.

### Resolved Issues
- Resolve CAMO transactions within a local transaction (RT69404)<br />
  On rare occasions, the final commit stage of a CAMO or Eager All Node transaction still needs to do lookups in the system catalog. This led to a segfault, because BDR did not properly wrap this operation in a (read-only) transaction with full access to system catalogs.

- Better validate inputs to administration functions (RM19276, RM18108, RM17994, RT69013)<br />
  When intentionally fed with invalid input (mostly NULL), some of the administrative functions of BDR crashed, leading to a restart of the Postgres node. This would constitute a denial of service attack for roles with either `bdr_application` or `bdr_superuser` privileges.

- Add a warning when trying to join known broken BDR versions (RT69088)<br />
  BDR versions 3.6.19 and older are susceptible to data-loss when joining a BDR cluster. BDR now identifies this situation and logs a warning at join time.

- Handle missing column gracefully for ALTER COLUMN TYPE (RM19389, RT69114)<br />
  The fix just throws same error Postgres would when ALTER COLUMN TYPE with non-existent column is executed.

- Fix JOINING state handling on consensus request timeout (RT69076)<br />
  The timeout during JOINING state handling could result in node unable to join the BDR group. The retry logic now handles this state correctly.

- Change the snapshot restore to follow Raft paper more closely<br />
  Fixes potential metadata consistency issues when node returns after longer period of downtime.

- Fix potential crash in bdr.resynchronize_table_from_node (RM19527)

- Extend `bdr.drop_node` with a check preventing premature removal (RM19280)<br />
  The function `bdr.drop_node` by default now checks whether the node to drop has been fully parted on all nodes prior to allowing to drop its metadata. An additional force argument allows to disable this check and effectively exposes the previous behavior.

- Validation of `replication_set_remove_table` input (RT69248, RM19620)<br />
  Check if the relation Oid passed as the function argument is valid.

### Other Changes
- Improve error messages (RM19483)

- Minor documentation clarifications and language fixes (RM19825, RM19296, RT69401, RT69044)

## BDR 3.6.22 (2020 Oct 01)

This is a security and maintenance release for BDR 3.6 which also includes various minor features.

### Resolved Issues

- Correct a hang in `bdr.wait_for_apply_queue` (RM11416, also affects CAMO)<br />
  Keepalive messages possibly move the LSN forward. In an otherwise quiescent system (without any transactions processed), this may have led to a hang in `bdr.wait_for_apply_queue`, because there may not be anything to apply for the corresponding PGL writer, so the `apply_lsn` doesn't ever reach the `receive_lsn`. A proper CAMO client implementation uses `bdr.logical_transaction_status`, which in turn uses the affected function internally. Thus a CAMO switch- or fail-over could also have led to a hang. This release prevents the hang by discarding LSN increments for which there is nothing to apply on the subscriber.

- Correct a problem with Raft snapshot writing when a 3.6.21 node became leader of a cluster that also included nodes on version 3.6.20 or earlier.

- Nodes that were parted but not subsequently dropped (so they still appear in the `bdr.node` table) can cause it as well. The issue can cause DDL locking to time out, galloc sequence allocation to stop, and other issues related to loss of functioning Raft-based consensus. If this problem is encountered, the following error will be seen in logs:

  `ERROR: invalid snapshot: record length [...] doesn't match expected length [...] for chunk "ddl_epoch"`

  and `SELECT bdr.get_raft_status()` will intermittently report `ERROR: could not find consensus worker when called.`

  To check if this issue could be affecting you, check `bdr.node` for any parted nodes with `proto_version_max` less than 13. Also query

  `SELECT status->>'protocol_version' FROM bdr.get_raft_status() status;`

  to see if the result is less than 13. If either is true and your cluster has 3.6.21 nodes you could be affected by the issue. To prevent or solve it you are affected by it, upgrade immediately to 3.6.22.

  This issue does not arise when all nodes are on 3.6.20 or older.

- Fix a problem with NULL values in `bdr.ddl_epoch` catalog (RM19046). Release 3.6.21 added a new `epoch_consumed_lsn` column to `bdr.ddl_epoch` catalog. Adding a new column would set the column value to NULL in all existing rows in the table. But the code failed to handle the NULL values properly. This could lead to reading garbage values or even memory access errors. The garbage values can potentially lead to global lock timeouts as a backend may wait on a LSN which is far into the future.
We fix this by updating all NULL values to '0/0' LSN, which is an invalid value representation for LSN. The column is marked NOT NULL explicitly and the code is fixed to never generate new NULL values for the column.

- Allow consensus protocol version upgrades despite parted nodes (RM19041)<br />
  Exclude already parted nodes from the consensus protocol version negotiation, as such nodes do not participate in the consensus protocol any more. Ensures the newest protocol version among the set of active nodes is used.

### Improvements
- Numerous fixes for galloc sequences (RM18519, RM18512) The "nextval" code for galloc sequences had numerous issues:

  - Large INCREMENT BY values (+ve or -ve) were not working correctly
  - Large CACHE values were not handled properly
  - MINVAL/MAXVAL not honored in some cases The crux of the issue was that large increments or cache calls would need to make multiple RAFT fetch calls. This caused the loop retry code to be invoked multiple times. The various variables to track the loops needed adjustment.
- Error out if INCREMENT BY is more than galloc chunk range (RM18519) <br />
  The smallint, int and bigint galloc sequences get 1000, 1000000, 1000000000 values allocated in each chunk respectively. We error out if the INCREMENT value is more than these ranges.

- Extend `bdr.get_node_sub_receive_lsn` with an optional committed argument<br />
  The default behavior has been corrected to return only the last received LSN for a committed transaction to apply (filtered), which is the original intent and use of the function (e.g. by HARP). Passing a false lets this function return the unfiltered most recent LSN received, matching the previous version's behavior. This change is related to the hang in `bdr.wait_for_apply_queue` mentioned above.

- Fix tracking of the last committed LSN for CAMO and Eager transactions (RM13509)<br />
  The GUC `bdr.last_committed_lsn` was only updated for standard asynchronous BDR transactions, not for CAMO or Eager ones.

## BDR 3.6.21 (2020 Aug 14)

This is a security and maintenance release for BDR 3.6 which also includes various minor features.

### Resolved Issues
- SECURITY: Qualify calls to unnest from `bdr.logical_transaction_status` (RM18359)<br />
Required to protect CAMO users from attack risks identified in CVE-2018-1058, when the user application avoids the insecure coding practices identified there. See BDR Security chapter for further explanation. `bdr.logical_transaction_status` is typically only used by an application taking advantage of the CAMO feature.

- SECURITY: Qualify a call to an inequality operator in `bdr_init_physical` (RM18359)<br />
  Since 3.6.20, the `bdr_init_physical` utility uses the `<>` inequality operator. Similar to the above entry, the operator is now called by its fully qualified name to avoid attack risks identified in CVE-2018-1058.

- SECURITY: Recent PostgreSQL 11.9 et al reported CVE-2020-14349. The related risk is the same as CVE-2018-1058 and was already handled in BDR3.6.19, so no further action has been taken in this release.

- Re-add the "local_only" replication origin (RT68021)<br />
  Using `bdr_init_physical` may have inadvertently removed it due to a bug that existing up until release 3.6.19. This release ensures to recreate it, if it's missing.

- Eliminate SQL calls to pg_switch_wal from BDR (RT68159, RM17356)<br />
  The helper function `bdr.move_group_slot_all_nodes` as well internal replay progress update handling invoked the Postgres function pg_switch_wal via SQL, thus requiring explicit execute permissions. Instead use direct internal calls from the BDR extension to avoid that requirement.

- Handle NULL arguments passed to functions in BDR schema gracefully (RT68375, RM17994) <br />
  Some of the functions in BDR schema, e.g. `bdr.alter_node_add_log_config()` caused segmentation fault when NULL arguments were passed to those. Those are fixed to handle the NULL arguments appropriately. Those functions which do not expect NULL arguments now throw an error mentioning so. Others handle NULL arguments according to the functionality offered by individual function.

- Prevent violation of NOT NULL constraints in BDR-internal catalogs (RM18335)<br />
  Postgres 11.9 is more strict with NOT NULL constraints for catalog tables. Correct and relax constraints for two internal tables for which BDR stores NULL values in.

- Wait for replication changes triggered by prior epoch (RM17594, RM17802)<br />
  When a node requests a global DDL lock, it now waits until it has seen the replication changes associated with the previous DDL. If the previous DDL was run on the same node, then there won't be any additional wait. But if the previous DDL was run on some other node, then this node must wait until it catches up replication changes from the other node. This improves handling of multiple concurrent DDL operations across the BDR Group which would previously result in global lock timeout, but now may cause additional wait in case of a large replication lag between the pair of nodes.

- Fix incorrect handling of MAXVALUE and MINVALUE for galloc sequences (RM14596)

- Fix concurrent action of nextval/currval when changing sequence kind (RT68438)<br />
  During nextval/currval calls, the sequence kind was fetched prior to locking the sequence, which allowed a concurrently executed call to `bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind()` to influence the returned value incorrectly.

- Disallow SCHEMA and SEQUENCE RENAME for galloc sequences (RM15554)<br />
  The consistent range allocator for galloc sequences identifies the sequence using schema name and sequence name, so changing the name of either of those could break it.

- Adjust chunk size of a galloc seq chunk if type was changed (RT68470, RM18297)

- Don't drop `bdr_local_only_origin` in `bdr_init_physical`<br />
  Also recreate it in upgrade script in case previous version of BDR has dropped it.

- Ensure there is at least one transaction after wal switch in `bdr.move_group_slot_all_nodes` (RT67591, RM17356)<br />
  This will move the group slot forward more hastily on servers with low concurrent activity.

- Fix PART_CATCHUP node state handling (RM17418)<br />
  In 3.6.20 different nodes might have had different ideas about what to do when there is not fully joined node during part of another node which could cause the part operation to stall indefinitely with only possible solution being forced part. 3.6.21 leaves the decision on what to do next on Raft leader and other nodes just follow, so the decision making is consistent across whole BDR group.

- Fix incorrect cache handling for sessions established prior to BDR node creation (RT68499).

### Improvements
- Allow use of CRDTs when BDR extension installed but without any node (RM17470)<br />
  Previously, restoring CRDT values on a node with BDR extension installed, but without a node created, would throw an ERROR when the CRDT data type requests the node id. We now store an InvalidOid value when the node id is not available. If the node is subsequently added to a BDR cluster, when the CRDT column is updated, InvalidOid will be replaced by a normal node id.

- Check validity of options when altering a galloc sequence (RM18301, RT68470)<br />
  Galloc sequences do not accept some options, so warn the user in case invalid options are used, as already occurs with timeshard sequences.

- `resynchronize_table_from_node()` freezes the table on target node (RM15987) <br />
  When we use this function the target table is truncated first and then copied into on the destination node. This activity additionally FREEZEs the tuples as the data is loaded. This then avoids a rewriting the target table to set hint bits, as well as avoiding high volume WAL writes which would occur when the table was first used after resyncronizing.

- Create a virtual sequence record on other nodes (RM16008, RT68438, RT68432)<br />
  If we create a galloc sequence and try to use its value in the same transaction block, then because it does not exist yet on other nodes, it used to error out with "could not fetch next sequence chunk" on the other nodes. We solve this by creating a virtual record on the other nodes.

- Add start parameter to bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind() (RT68430)<br />
  Allows specifying new starting point for galloc and local sequences in single step with changing the sequence kind.

- Add an internal consistent consensus-based key-value store for use by HARP (RM17825)<br />
  This is not meant for direct use by users, but enables features for additional tooling.

- Improve latency of global locks in cases where other nodes respond very quickly, such as when there is no replication lag

- Throw errors for configuration parameters that were supported by BDR1 and BDR2, but are no longer supported by BDR3 (RT68529).<br />
  Since PostgreSQL does not throw an ERROR/WARNING while setting an extension qualified, non-existent parameter, users with BDR1/BDR2 experience may fail to notice that the parameter is not supported by BDR3. We now explicitly catch all attempts to use parameter names that match unsupported BDR1/BDR2 configuration parameters and throw an ERROR.

- Document known issues in "Appendix C" section of documentation (RM18169)

## BDR 3.6.20 (2020 Jun 12)

This is a security and maintenance release for BDR 3.6 which also includes various minor features.

### Additional Actions
- Run LiveCompare following logical join to handle rare divergent errors (RT67307)<br />
  When running a logical join when nodes are down or have large replication lag can cause divergence of concurrent transactions that conflict during join. When running a logical join from a source to a target node, changes made on other nodes that were still in-flight could cause conflicts when applied; if conflicts occurs, conflict resolution might diverge for those rows. Running LiveCompare immediately following the join will clean up any such issues; this can be carefully targeted using a conflict logging table. Required actions are now fully documented.

### Resolved Issues
- Ignore self-conflicts during logical join that could lead to data loss (RT67858)<br />
  Changes made to tables during logical join could conflict with the original rows, as a result of rewriting the commit timestamp onto the target node. Explicitly ignore such conflicts seen while in join catchup mode, avoiding the associated data loss.

- Ensure origin position messages cannot be skipped during join (RT67858)<br />
  Progress watermark messages are now written to WAL transaction stream rather than being issued asynchronously via the messaging layer. During join we now wait for the joining node to see at least one watermark to ensure no timing window exists that could lead to skipping the origin position during join, thus avoiding data loss.

- Resilience against idle_in_transaction_session_timeout (RM13649, RT67029, RT67688)<br />
  Set idle_in_transaction_session_timeout to 0 so we avoid any user setting that could close the connection and invalidate the snapshot.

- Allow early part_node to interrupt a hanging join (RT67980, RM16659)<br />
  In case a new node failing to join and not making any progress, attempting to remove it with plain (non-forced) `bdr.part_node` could lead to a hang. Resolve this by skipping the PART_CATCHUP phase for such a node, as it did not possibly produce any transactions to catch up to.

- Warn when joining to BDR group with versions of BDR which have known consistency issues<br />
  The above fixes for join process only work if whole BDR node is upgraded to the 3.6.20 or higher (protocol version 12+), so we warn about joining to groups with older versions. In-place upgrades work normally.

- Fix minor issues detected by Coverity scanner.

### Improvements
-   Ignore `bdr.assess_update_replica_identity` parameter in writer worker processes (RM15983) (EE)<br />
    Setting this in `postgresql.conf` can cause a potential outage if executed by writer worker processes. Hence, writer worker processes ignore this parameter.

- CentOS 8 is now supported, starting with this release.

-   Improve diagnostic logging of the join process (RT67858)<br />
    Include the fact that we retry the join state requests after failure in the error message and raise the log level of slot/origin creation/movement from DEBUG to LOG so that it's always logged by default.

## BDR 3.6.19 (2020 May 20)

This is a security and maintenance release for BDR 3.6 which includes also
includes various minor features.

### Resolved Issues

-   SECURITY: Set search_path to empty for internal BDR SQL statements (RM15373)  
    Also, fully qualify all operators used internally. BDR is now protected
    from attack risks identified in CVE-2018-1058, when the user application
    avoids the insecure coding practices identified there.
    See BDR Security chapter for further explanation.

-   SECURITY: Raise required privileges for BDR admin functions (RM15542)  
    When executed by roles other than superuser or bdr_superuser:

    -   bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection needs table owner
    -   bdr.column_timestamps_enable needs table owner
    -   bdr.column_timestamps_disable needs table owner
    -   bdr.drop_trigger needs table owner
    -   bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind needs sequence owner
    -   bdr.global_lock_table needs UPDATE, DELETE or TRUNCATE (like LOCK TABLE)
    -   bdr.create_conflict_trigger needs TRIGGER permission on the table and
        EXECUTE permission on the function
    -   bdr.create_transform_trigger needs TRIGGER permission on the table and
        EXECUTE permission on the function

    A new GUC `bdr.backwards_compatibility` allows to skip this
    newly introduced check for existing clients requiring the former
    behavior.

-   Resolve a hang possible after multiple global lock releases (RT67570, RM14994)  
    A bug in the code path for releasing a global lock after a timeout
    led to overriding the backend's PID with a value of `-1`, also
    showing up in the `waiters` list of `bdr.global_locks`.  This in
    turn crippled the waiters list and ultimately led to an infinite
    loop.  This release fixes the override, which is the original cause
    of this hang and correctly removes entries from the lock wait list.

-   Correct parsing of BDR WAL messages (RT67662)  
    In rare cases a DDL which is replicated across a EDB Postgres Distributed cluster and requires
    a global lock may cause errors such as "invalid memory alloc request size"
    or "insufficient data left in message" due to incorrect parsing of direct
    WAL messages. The code has been fixed to parse and handle such WAL
    messages correctly.

-   Fix locking in ALTER TABLE with multiple sub commands (RM14771)
    Multiple ALTER TABLE sub-commands should honor the locking
    requirements of the overall set. If one sub-command needs the locks,
    then the entire ALTER TABLE command needs it as well.

-   Fix bug in example of ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN workaround (RT67668)  
    Explain why bdr.global_lock_table() is needed to avoid concurrent
    changes that cause problems, in that case.

-   Fix a hang after promotion of a physical standby (RM15728)  
    A physical standby promoted to a BDR node may have failed to start
    replicating due to the use of stale data from an internal catalog
    cache.

-   Fix crash when bdr.trigger_get_type() is called by itself (RM15592)
    Calling bdr.trigger_get_type() outside a streaming trigger function would
    cause a crash. Fixed the function to return NULL when called outside a
    streaming trigger function.

### Improvements

-   bdr.trigger_get_origin_node_id() allows preferred-node resolution (RM15105, RT67601)  
    Some customers have a requirement to resolve conflicts based upon the node
    that is the source of the change. This is also known as trusted source,
    trusted site or AlwaysWins resolution.  Previous versions of BDR allowed
    these mechanisms with 2 nodes; this new function allows this option with
    any number of nodes. Examples are documented.

-   BDR now accepts URIs in connection strings (RM14588)  
    All connection strings can now use the format URI "postgresql://... "

-   New function bdr.resynchronize_table_from_node() (RM13565, RT67666, RT66968)
    allows a single table to be truncated and then resynced from a chosen node,
    while holding a global dml lock. This allows a table to be resynchronized
    following a data divergence or data corruption without needing to
    regenerate the whole node. Foreign Keys are removed and re-enabled afterwards.

-   Improve filtering of changes made by explicitly unreplicated transactions (RM15557)  
    Previously changes made by transactions using bdr.xact_replication = off
    or by bdr.difference_fix transactions would be sent to the remote
    node, generating spurious conflicts and wasting effort. Changes
    are now filtered on the source node instead, improving performance.

-   Initial and periodic transaction status checks use async libpq (RM13504) (EE)  
    With CAMO enabled, the status of in-flight transactions is checked
    against a partner node.  This uses an standard Postgres connection
    via libpq, which used to block the PGL manager process.  This
    release changes the logic to use asynchronous libpq to allow the PGL
    manager to perform other tasks (e.g. process Raft messages) while
    that status check is performed.  This reduces chances of timeouts or
    deadlocks due to a more responsive PGL manager process.

-   Additional message fields assist diagnosis of DDL replication issues (RM15292)  

-   Clarify documentation regarding privileges required for BDR users (RT67259, RM15533)

## BDR 3.6.18 (2020 Apr 16)

This is a maintenance release for BDR 3.6 which includes minor features
as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Add synchronize_structure option to join_node_group (RM14200, RT67243)  
    New synchronize_structure option can be set to either 'all' or
    'none', which either sychronizes the whole schema or copies no DDL.
    This allows for rolling application schema upgrades to be performed
    with a user-managed schema (DDL) change step.

-   Make bdr*difference_fix** functions use pre-created local origin (RM14189)  
    The bdr*difference_fix** family of functions used to create a local origin to
    carry out conflict fixes.  We now pre-create "bdr_local_only_origin" local
    origin at extension creation time.  This same local origin is used by the above
    functions now.

-   Adjust monitored values in bdr.monitor_group_versions() (RM14494)  
    We no longer report CRITICAL when pglogical version different to bdr version,
    which is actually not important. We now report WARNING if BDR editions differ
    between nodes.

-   Substantial formatting corrections and spelling check of documentation

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix node join so it uses only `bdr_superuser` permissions (RM14121, RT67259)  
    This affects the `join_target_dsn` connection of the
    `join_node_group` function, which has been fixed to work with only
    `bdr_superuser` right for the role used to connect.

-   GRANT EXECUTE on bdr.show_subscription_status TO bdr_real_all_stats (RT67360, RM14624)  
    This allows both bdr_read_all_stats and bdr_monitor roles to access the
    bdr.subscription_summary view

-   Fix failure of bdr_init_physical to copy data columns using BDR types (RM14522)  
    bdr_init_physical now uses bdr.drop_node() rather than DROP
    EXTENSION, which caused all columns using BDR datatypes such as CRDTs
    to be silently dropped from tables.

-   Fix failure in 3.6.17 upgrade script caused by views referencing CRDTs (RT67505)  
    Upgrade script now executed only on tables and mat views. Upgrade failure may
    give a spurious error such as "ERROR: BDR global lock manager not initialized yet"

-   Set non-join subscriptions to CATCHUP state rather than INIT state at startup  
    Avoids a rare but possible case of copying metadata twice during node join.

-   Fix lookup for a galloc sequence when BDR catalogs are absent. (RT67455, RM14564)  
    This might cause a query on a sequence to throw an error
    like "cache lookup failed for relation ..." when bdr library is added to
    shared_preload_libraries but BDR extension is not created.

-   Allow ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN with BDR loaded but not initialized (RM14435)  
    With the BDR extension loaded, but no local BDR node created, the
    DDL replication logic now still allows execution of an ALTER TABLE
    ALTER COLUMN operation.

-   LOCK TABLE warning not shown when BDR node is not created (RM14613)  
    Assess LOCK TABLE statement does not show when bdr.assess_lock_statement
    is set to a value other than 'ignore' until BDR node is created.

-   Prevent a NULL dereference in consensus_disable (RM14618)  
    `bdr.consensus_disable` expected the consensus process to be
    running.  Fix it to prevent a segfault if that's not the case when
    the function is called.

## BDR 3.6.17 (2020 Mar 31)

This is a maintenance release for BDR 3.6 which includes minor features
as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Allow ALTER TABLE ALTER COLUMN TYPE with rewrite when not replicating DDL
    (EE) (RM13244)  
    In some cases, in controlled DBA environments, it is possible to change
    the type of a column to an implicitly castable one by adopting a rolling
    upgrade for the type of this column in a non replicated environment on
    all the nodes one by one. We allow concurrent activity on this table on other
    nodes during the rewrite. Also note that such ALTER commands cannot be run
    within transaction blocks.

-   Add conflict logging configuration view (RM13691, RT66898)  
    Add `bdr.node_log_config` view that shows information on the conflict
    logging configuration.

-   Add new group monitoring views and functions (RM14014)  
    These views and functions report the state of the BDR installation,
    replication slots and consensus across all nodes in the BDR group.

-   Add current state of DDL replication related configuration parameters to log
    context (RM13637)  
    Improves troubleshooting.

### Resolved Issues

-   Don't drop existing slot for a joining node (RM13310, RT67289, RT66797)  
    This could have caused inconsistencies when node was joined using
    `bdr_init_physical` because it precreated the slot for new node which was
    supposed to be reused during join, instead it was dropped and recreated.
    We now keep the slot correctly which ensures there are no inconsistencies.

-   Fix restart of CAMO node despite missing partner node (EE) (RM13899, RT67161)  
    Prevent an error looking up the BDR node configured as a CAMO
    origin. In case the node got dropped, it does not exist, but might
    still be configured for CAMO.

-   Fix locking in `bdr.column_timestamps_enable()` (EE) (RT67150)  
    Don't hold same transaction and session level locks otherwise `PREPARE`,
    CAMO and Eager replication can't work for transactions where this is used.

-   Don't try to apply BDR conflict resolution to PGL-only subscriptions (RT67178)  
    BDR should only be active on BDR subscriptions, not pglogical ones.

-   Let the CAMO partner return the final decision, once learned (RM13520)  
    If an origin node switches to Local mode, temporarily dropping CAMO
    protections, it's possible for the CAMO partner to provisionally
    abort the transaction internally, but actually commit it eventually
    (to be in sync with the origin node).  In earlier releases, this was
    not recorded leading to the status query function to continue to
    return an "aborted" result for the transaction.  This release allows
    the final commit decision to override the provisional abort
    internally (catalog table bdr.node_pre_commit).

-   Make CLCD/CRDT data types properly TOAST-able (EE) (RM13689)  
    CLCD/CRDT data types were defined as using PLAIN storage. This can become
    as issue with a table with too many columns or if a large number of nodes
    are involved. This is now solved by converting these data types to use
    EXTENDED storage thus allowing for large sized values.

-   Ensure duplicate messages are not received during node promotion (RM13972)
    Send a watermark from join source to the joining node during catchup phase
    of join to ensure it learns about current replication positions of all other
    nodes even if there are no data to forward from them during the catchup.
    Otherwise we might ask for older lsns during the promotion and receive
    duplicate messages and fail the join.

-   Automatically disable CAMO for non-transactional DDL operations (EE)  
    Several DDL operations are not allowed within a transaction block
    and as such cannot reasonably benefit from the protection that CAMO
    offers.  Automatically disable CAMO for these, so as to avoid
    "cannot PREPARE" errors at COMMIT time.

-   Fix errors when `bdr.move_group_slot_all_nodes` is called with no BDR node
    present in the database (RT67245)  
    Allows setting up physical standbys of future BDR master before creating the
    BDR node.

-   Make sure table has a `PRIMARY KEY` when CLCD is turned on (EE)  
    This is sanity check that prevents user from enabling CLCD on tables without
    a `PRIMARY KEY` as that would break the conflict detection for such tables.

## BDR 3.6.16 (2020 Mar 05)

BDR 3.6.16 is the sixteenth minor release of the BDR 3.6 series.  This release
includes minor new features as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Add `bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection()` (RM13631)  
    This function unifies the UI for changing conflict detection method for
    individual tables. Allows choice between origin based, row_version based
    and column level based (EE-only) conflict detection using same interface.
    The old functions are still supported, although they should be considered
    deprecated and will be removed in BDR 3.7.

-   Add `bdr.default_conflict_detection` configuration option (RM13631)  
    Related to the above `bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection()` function, the
    new configuration option allows setting the default conflict detection
    method for newly created tables.

-   Change how forced part node works (RM13447)  
    Forced node part will now first try to get consensus for parting and only
    do the local change if the consensus fails or if it's called for node which
    already started consensus based part process but the process has stuck on
    one of the steps.

-   Automatically drop `bdr-enterprise` extension when dropping the `bdr`
    extension (RM13703)  
    This improves usability when trying to drop the bdr extension without
    cascade, which is useful for example when user wants to keep the pglogical
    node associated with BDR.

-   Improve error reporting when joining node with same name as existing active
    node (RM13447, RT66940)  
    The previous error message was confusing as it made it seem like BDR does
    not allow node name reuse at all (which it does).

-   Set application_name in `bdr_init_physical`  
    Helps when diagnosing issues with this tool.

-   Improve documentation of `ALTER TABLE` limitations (RM13512, RM13244, RT66940)  
    Including new workaround for changing length of varchar columns.

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix pg_dump for BDR galloc sequences (RM13462, RT67051)  
    Galloc sequences internally store extra data in sequence heap; BDR now hides
    the extra data from SELECTs so that queries on the sequence (which can be
    normal user query or a query from pg_dump for example) only show the usual
    sequence information.

-   Fix enforcement of REPLICA IDENTITY FULL for CLCD  
    Advanced conflict-handling approaches (CLCD, CRDT) require the table to
    have REPLICA IDENTITY FULL. However due to how the features initially
    evolved independently, this was not enforced (and documented) properly
    and consistently. We now correctly enforce the REPLICA IDENTITY FULL for
    CLCD for every table.

-   Fix node name reuse of nodes which were used as join sources for other
    existing nodes in a BDR group (RM12178, RM13447)  
    The source nodes have special handling so we need to make sure that newly
    joining node is not confused with node of same name that has been parted.

-   Apply local states for existing nodes on newly joining node (RT66940)  
    Otherwise decision making in during the join process might use wrong state
    information and miss some tasks like slot creation or subscription creation.

-   Correctly clean node-level log filters and conflict resolver configuration
    (RM13704)  
    This solves issues when trying to drop BDR node without dropping associated
    pglogical node and later recreating the BDR node again.

-   Prevent a segfault in Raft on the parted BDR node (RM13705)

## BDR 3.6.15 (2020 Feb 14)

BDR 3.6.15 is the fifteenth minor release of the BDR 3.6 series.  This release
includes minor new features as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Keep a permanent log of all resolved CAMO decisions (RM12712)  
    Record every decision taken by the CAMO partner when queried by
    `bdr.logical_transaction_status`, i.e. in the failover case.

-   Add functions for enabling/disabling row version tracking (RM12930)  
    Easier to use and less error prone interface than manually adding column
    and trigger.

-   Add `currval()` and `lastval()` support for `timeshard` and `galloc`
    sequences (RM12059)  

-   Add `pglogical.min_worker_backoff_delay` setting to rate limit background
    worker re-launches, and `pglogical.worker_tasks` diagnostic view for
    background worker activity. See pglogical 3.6.15 release notes and
    documentation for details.

### Resolved Issues

-   Prevent buffer overrun when copying a TOAST column value inside the walsender
    output plugin (RT66839)  
    This fixes issue that resulted in walsender crashes with certain types of
    workloads which touch TOASTed columns.

-   Fix "type bdr.column_timestamps not found" error when bdr-enterprise extension
    is not installed when bdr enterprise library is in shared_preload_libraries
    (RT66758, RM13110)

## BDR 3.6.14.1 (2020 Feb 05)

BDR 3.6.14 is an important bug fix release on top of BDR 3.6.14. This release contains a critical crash fix in memory allocation.

### Resolved Issues
- Prevent buffer overrun when copying a TOAST column value inside the walsender output plugin (RT66839)
This fixes issue that resulted in walsender crashes with certain types of workloads which touch TOASTed columns.

- Fix "type bdr.column_timestamps not found" error when bdr-enteprise extension is not installed when bdr enterprise library is in shared_preload_libraries (RT66758, RM13110)

## BDR 3.6.14 (2020 Jan 31)

BDR 3.6.14 is a critical maintenance release of the BDR 3.6 series.  This release
includes major fixes for CAMO and other features as well as minor new features.

### Improvements

-   Add `bdr.camo_local_mode_delay` to allow throttling in CAMO Local mode (RM12402)  
    Provides a simple throttle on transactional throughput in CAMO Local mode, so
    as to prevent the origin node from processing more transactions than
    the pair would be able to handle with CAMO enabled.

-   Add `bdr.camo_enable_client_warnings` to control warnings in CAMO mode (RM12558)  
    Warnings are emitted if an activity is carried out in the database for which CAMO
    properties cannot be guaranteed. Well-informed users can choose to disable this
    if they want to avoid such warnings filling up their logs.

-   Warn on unrecognized configuration settings

-   Move 'loading BDR' message earlier in startup messages

-   Significantly enhance docs for Row Version Conflict Detection (RT66493)  

-   Clarify docs that NOTIFY is not possible with CAMO/Eager

-   Add `global_lock_request_time`, `local_lock_request_time`
    and `last_state_change_time` columns to `bdr.global_locks` view for
    lock monitoring and diagnostic use.

-   Add SQL functions for export/import of consensus snapshot (RM11433)  
    These functions allow for manual synchronization of BDR system catalogs in
    case of corruption or user mistake.

### Resolved Issues

-   UPDATEs skipped on the partner node because remote_commit_ts set incorrectly (RM12476)  
    Commit timestamps were unset in some CAMO messages, leading to losing last-update-wins
    comparisons that they should have won, which meant some UPDATEs were skipped when an
    UPDATE happened concurrently from another master. This doesn't occur normally
    in an AlwaysOn cluster, though could occur if writes happen via a passive master node.

-   Only resolve those prepared transactions for which controlling backend is gone (RM12388)  
    This fixes a race condition between the pglogical manager process and the user backend
    running a CAMO transaction. A premature attempt by the manager process to resolve a
    prepared transaction could lead to the transaction getting marked as aborted on the
    partner node, whereas the origin ends up committing the transaction. This results in
    data divergence. This fix ensures that the manager process only attempts to resolve
    prepared transactions for which the controlling user backend has either exited or is no
    longer actively managing the CAMO transaction. The revised code also avoids taking
    ProcArrayLock, reducing contention and thus improving performance and throughput.

-   Prevent premature cleanup of commit decisions on a CAMO partner. (RM12540)  
    Ensure to keep commit or abort decisions on CAMO or Eager All Node
    transactions in bdr.node_pre_commit for longer than 15 minutes if
    there is at least one node that has not learned the decision and may
    still query it.  This eliminates a potential for inconsistency
    between the CAMO origin and partner nodes.

-   Resolve deadlocked CAMO or Eager transactions (RM12903, RM12910)  
    Add a `lock_timeout` as well as an abort feedback to the origin node
    to resolve distributed deadlocking due to conflicting primary key
    updates.  This also prevents frequent restarts and retries of the
    PGL writer process for Eager All Node and sync CAMO transactions.

-   Fix potential divergence by concurrent updates on toasted data from multiple nodes (RM11058)  
    This can occur when an UPDATE changes one or more toasted columns, while a
    concurrent, but later UPDATE commits on a different node. This occurs because
    PostgreSQL does not WAL log TOAST data if it wasn't changed by an UPDATE
    command. As a result the logically decoded rows have these columns
    marked as unchanged TOAST and don't contain the actual value. Fix is handled
    automatically on BDR-EE, but on BDR-SE additional triggers need to be created
    on tables that publish updates and that have toastable data (this is also done
    automatically). The additional check has a small but measurable performance
    overhead. Logged data will increase in affected cases only. We recommend
    tuning `toast_tuple_target` to optimize storage.
    Tables with `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` are not affected by this issue or fix.

-   Properly close connections after querying camo partner to avoid leak. (RM12572)  

-   Correct `bdr.wait_for_apply_queue` to respect the given LSN (RM12552)  
    In former releases, the `target_lsn` argument was overridden and the
    function acted the same as if no `target_lsn` had been given.

-   Ignore progress messages from unknown nodes (RT66461)  
    Avoids problems during node parting.

-   Make bdr.xact_replication work with ALTER TABLE and parallel query (RM12489)  

## BDR 3.6.12 (2019 Dec 18)

BDR 3.6.12 is the twelfth minor release of the BDR 3.6 series.  This release
includes minor new features as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Apply `check_full_row` on `DELETE` operations (RT66493)  
    This allows detection of `delete_recently_updated` conflict even if the
    `DELETE` operation happened later in wall-clock time on tables with full
    row checking enabled.

-   Improve Global DML lock tracing  
    Add more information to the Global DML Lock trace to help debugging global
    locking issues more effectively.

-   Validate replication sets at join time. (RM12020, RT66310)  
    Raise an ERROR from `bdr.join_node_group()` if the joining node was
    configured to subscribe to non-default replication sets by using
    `bdr.alter_node_replication_sets()` before join but some of the subscribed-to
    replication sets are missing.

    On prior releases the joining node might fail later in the join process and
    have to be force-parted. Or it might appear to succeed but join with empty
    tables.

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix crash in `bdr.run_on_all_nodes` (RM12114, RT66515)  
    Due to incorrect initialization the `bdr.run_on_all_nodes` could have
    previously crashed with segmentation fault in presence of `PARTED` nodes.

-   Don't broadcast the epoch consumed WAL messages (RM12042)  
    Broadcasting the message to all nodes could result in some nodes moving the
    Global DDL Lock Epoch forward in situations where it wasn't safe to do so yet,
    resulting in lowered protection against concurrent DML statements when running
    a statement that requires a Global DML Lock.

-   Fix global locking on installations with multiple BDR nodes on single
    PostgreSQL instance  
    The global locking could get spurious timeouts because the lock messages
    contained wrong node id if there were more than one BDR node on a single
    PostgreSQL instance.

-   Fix typos in some example SQL in docs  

## BDR 3.6.11 (2019 Dec 04)

BDR 3.6.11 is the eleventh minor release of the BDR 3.6 series.  This release
includes minor new features as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Support APIs for PostgreSQL 11.6  

-   Allow the use of "-"(hyphen) character in the node name (RM11567, RT65945)  
    If a pglogical3 node would have been created with a hyphen in the node name
    BDR couldn't create the node on that database.

-   Don't generate `update_origin_change` conflict if we know the updating node
    has seen the latest local change (RM11556, RT66145)  
    Reduces conflict resolution overhead and logging of `update_origin_change`
    when the conflict can be shown to be false-positive. This does not completely
    remove false-positives from `update_origin_change` but reduces their
    occurrence in presence of UPDATES on older rows.
    This reduces conflict log spam when origin changes for older rows. Also,
    conflict triggers will be called significantly fewer times.

-   Extend `bdr.wait_for_apply_queue` to wait for a specific LSN (RM11059, RT65827)

-   Add new parameter `bdr.last_committed_lsn` (RM11059, RT65827)  
    Value will be reported back to client after each COMMIT, allowing applications
    to perform causal reads across multiple nodes.

-   Add status query functions for apply and received LSN (RM11059, RM11664)  
    New functions `bdr.get_node_sub_receive_lsn` and
    `bdr.get_node_sub_apply_lsn` simplify fetching the internal
    information required for HAproxy health check scripts.

-   Add sum() and avg() aggregates for CRDT types (RM11592, RT66168)

-   Speed up initial synchronization of replication slots on physical standby
    (RM6747)

-   Add `bdr.pg_xact_origin` function to request origin for an xid (RM11971)  

-   Add `bdr.truncate_locking` configuration option which sets the `TRUNCATE`
    command's locking behavior (RT66326)  
    This configuration option determines whether (when `true`) `TRUNCATE` obeys
    the `bdr.ddl_locking` setting which is the new, safe behavior or if
    (when `false`, the default) never does any locking, which is the old,
    potentially unsafe behavior.

-   Allow conflict triggers to see commit timestamp of `update_recently_deleted`
    target rows (RM11808, RT66182)

### Resolved Issues

-   Add hash/equality opclass for the column_timestamps data type (RT66207)  
    REPLICA IDENTITY FULL requires comparison of all columns of a tuple,
    hence column_timestamps data type must support equality comparisons.

-   Correct conflict docs for BDR-EE (RT66239, RM9670)  
    Changes made in BDR3.5 were not correctly reflected in conflict docs

-   Don't check protocol version for galloc sequences during initial sync
    (RM11576, RT65660)  
    If galloc sequences already exist, bdr_init_physical doesn't need to
    recheck protocol versions.

-   Fix galloc sequence chunk tracking corruption on lagging nodes
    (RM11933, RT66294)  
    In presence of node with lagging consensus the chunk tracking table would
    diverge on different nodes which then resulted in wrong chunks being assigned
    on consensus leader change. As a result node might start generating already
    used sequence numbers. This fix ensures that the table never diverges.

-   Fix galloc sequence local chunk information corruption (RM11932, RT66294)  
    Make sure we correctly error out when in all cases request of new chunk
    has failed, otherwise we might assign bogus chunks to the sequence locally
    which would result in potentially duplicate sequence numbers generated on
    different nodes.

-   Fix a case where the consensus worker event loop could stall in the message
    broker when trying to reconnect to an unreachable or unresponsive peer node
    by being more defensive about socket readability/writeability checks during
    the libpq async connection establishment phase. (RM11914)  

    This issue is most likely to arise when a peer node's underlying host fails
    hard and ceases replying to all TCP requests, or where the peer's network
    blackholes traffic to the peer instead of reporting a timely ICMP
    Destination Unreachable message.

    Effect of the issue on affected nodes would result in operations which
    require consensus to either stall or not work at all - those include:
    DDL lock acquisition, Eager transaction commit, calling
    `bdr.get_consensus_status()` function, galloc sequence chunk allocation,
    leader election and BDR group slot advancing.
    This could have been visible to users as spurious lock timeout errors or
    increased lag for the BDR group slot.

-   Fix a race condition with global locks and DML (RM12042)  
    Prevent mismatching ordering of lock operations against DML with
    three or more concurrently writing nodes.  This allows to properly
    protect a TRUNCATE against concurrent DML from multiple writer
    nodes.

-   Repeat reporting of `local_node_id` to support transparent proxies (EE)
    (RM12025, RM12033)  
    With CAMO enabled, BDR reports a `bdr.local_node_id` GUC to the
    client.  To fully support transparent proxies like HAproxy, BDR now reports this
    value once per transaction in combination with `transaction_id`, to
    ensure a client doesn't ever return incorrect results from PQparameterStatus()
    because of a stale cache caused by missing a transparent connection switch.

-   Fix global DDL and DML lock recovery after instance restart or crash
    (RM12042)  
    Previous versions of BDR might not correctly block the writes against global
    lock if the node or apply worker restarted after the lock was acquired.
    This could lead to divergent data changes in case the protected command(s)
    were changing data concurrently.

-   Fix global DDL and DML lock blocking of replication changes (RM12042)  
    Previous versions of BDR would continue replication of changes to a locked
    table from other nodes. This could result in temporary replication errors or
    permanent divergent data changes if the transaction which acquired the global
    lock would be applied on some nodes with delay.

-   Fix hang in cleanup/recovery of acquired global lock in the apply worker  
    The apply worker which acquired global lock for another node could on exit
    leak the hanging lock which could then get "stolen" by different backend.
    This could cause the apply worker to wait for lock acquisition of same lock
    forever after restart.

-   Don't hold back freezeLimit forever (EE) (RM11783)  
    The Enterprise Edition of BDR holds back freeze point to ensure enough info
    is available for conflict resolution at all times. Make sure that we don't
    hold the freeze past xid wraparound warning limit to avoid loss of availability.
    Allow the limit to move forward gracefully to avoid risk of vacuum freeze storms.

-   Properly close connections in `bdr.run_on_all_nodes`  
    Removes log spam about connection reset by peer when `bdr.run_on_all_nodes`
    is used.

-   Clarify docs that CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW is not supported yet. (RT66363)

## BDR 3.6.10 (2019 Oct 29)

BDR 3.6.10 is the tenth minor release of the BDR 3.6 series.  This release
includes minor new features as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Add new optional performance mode for CAMO - remote_write (EE) (RM6749)  
    This release enables a CAMO remote_write mode offering quicker
    feedback at time of reception of a pre-commit message from the CAMO
    partner, rather than only after the application of the transaction.
    Significantly better performance in exchange for small loss of robustness.

-   Defer switching to CAMO mode until the partner has caught up (EE) (RM9605/RT65000/RT65827)  
    In async mode for improved availability, CAMO allows to switch to a
    local mode in case the CAMO partner is not reachable.  When
    switching back, it may have to catchup before it can reasonably
    confirm new transactions from its origin.  The origin now uses an
    estimate of the catchup time to defer the switch back to CAMO mode
    to eliminate transactions timing out due to the CAMO partner still
    catching up.

-   Add functions wait_for_apply_queue and wait_for_camo_partner_queue (EE)  
    Allows to wait for transactions already received but currently
    queued for application.  These can be used to prevent stale reads on
    a BDR node replicated to in `remote_write` mode.

-   Improve monitoring of replication, especially around catchup estimates for peer nodes (EE) (RM9798)  
    Introduce two new views `bdr.node_replication_rates` and `bdr.node_estimates`
    to get a reasonable estimate of how far behind a peer node is in terms of
    applying WAL from this local node.  The `bdr.node_replication_rates` view
    gives an overall picture of the outgoing replication activity in terms of
    the average apply rate whereas the `bdr.node_estimates` focuses on the catchup
    estimates for peer nodes.

-   Support Column-Level Conflict Resolution for partitioned tables (EE) (RM10098, RM11310)  
    Make sure that newly created or attached partitions are setup for CLCD if
    their parent table has CLCD enabled.

-   Take global DML lock in fewer cases (RM9609).  
    Don't globally lock relations created in current transaction, and also
    relations that are not tables (for example views) as those don't
    get data via replication.

### Resolved Issues

-   Disallow setting `external` storage parameter on columns that are part of a primary key (RM11336).  
    With such a setting, any `UPDATE` could not be replicated as the primary key
    would not get decoded by PostgreSQL.

-   Prevent ABA issue with `check_full_tuple = true`. (RM10940, RM11233)  
    We only do the full row check if `bdr.inc_row_version()` trigger exists on
    a table from now on to prevent ABA issue when detecting conflict on UPDATEs
    that didn't change any data when `check_full_tuple` is set to `true`.

## BDR 3.6.9 (2019 Oct 10)

BDR 3.6.9 is the ninth minor release of the BDR 3.6 series.  This release
includes minor new features as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Parameters to help BDR assessment by tracking certain application events (EE)
      bdr.assess_update_replica_identity = IGNORE (default) | LOG | WARNING | ERROR
        Updates of the Replica Identity (typically the Primary Key)
      bdr.assess_lock_statement = IGNORE (default) | LOG | WARNING | ERROR
        Two types of locks that can be tracked are:
    ```
    * explicit table-level locking (LOCK TABLE ...) by user sessions
    * explicit row-level locking (SELECT ... FOR UPDATE/FOR SHARE) by user sessions
    ```
    (RM10812,RM10813)

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix crash MIN/MAX for gsum and pnsum CRDT types (RM11049)

-   Disallow parted nodes from requesting bdr.part_node() on other nodes. (RM10566, RT65591)

## BDR 3.6.8 (2019 Sep 23)

BDR 3.6.8 is the eighth minor release of the BDR 3.6 series. This
release includes a fix for a critical data loss issue as well as fixes
for other issues identified with previous releases.

### Improvements

-   Create the `bdr.triggers` view  (EE) (RT65773) (RM10874)  
    More information on the triggers related to the table name, the
    function that is using it, on what event is triggered and what's the
    trigger type.

### Resolved Issues

-   Loss of TOAST data on remote nodes replicating UPDATEs (EE) (RM10820, RT65733)  
    A bug in the transform trigger code path has been identified to
    potentially set toasted columns (very long values for particular
    columns) to NULL when applying UPDATEs on remote nodes, even when
    transform triggers have never been used. Only BDR-EE is affected
    and only when tables have a toast table defined and are not using
    REPLICA IDENTITY FULL.  BDR3 SE is not affected by this issue.
    LiveCompare has been enhanced with damage assessment and data recovery
    features, with details provided in a separate Tech Alert to
    known affected users.
    This release prevents further data loss due to this issue.

-   CAMO: Eliminate a race leading to inadvertent timeouts (EE) (RM10721)  
    A race condition led to pre-commit confirmations from a CAMO partner
    being ignored.  This in turn caused inadvertent timeouts for CAMO-protected
    transactions and poor performance in combination with
    `synchronous_replication_availability` set to `async`.  This fixes
    an issue introduced with release 3.6.7.

-   CAMO: Properly handle transaction cancellation at COMMIT time (EE) (RM10741)  
    Allow the COMMIT of a CAMO-protected transaction to be aborted (more
    gracefully than via node restart or PANIC).  Enable run-time
    reconciliation with the CAMO partner to make the CAMO pair
    eventually consistent.

-   CAMO: Ensure the status query function keeps CAMO enabled. (EE) (RM10803)  
    The use of the `logical_transaction_status` function disabled CAMO
    for the entire session, rather than just for the query.  Depending
    on how a CAMO client (or a proxy in between) used the session, this
    could lead to CAMO being inadvertently disabled.  This has been
    fixed and CAMO remains enabled independent of calls of this
    function.

-   Eager: cleanup stale transactions. (EE) (RM10595)  
    Ensures transactions aborted during their COMMIT phase are cleaned
    up eventually on all nodes.

-   Correct TransactionId comparison when setting VACUUM freeze limit.  
    This could lead to ERROR: cannot freeze committed xmax
    for a short period at xid wrap, causing VACUUMs to fail.
    (EE) (RT65814, RT66211)

## BDR 3.6.7.1

This is a hot-fix release on top of 3.6.7.

### Resolved Issues

-   Prevent bogus forwarding of transactions from a removed origin. (RT65671, RM10605)  
    After the removal of an origin, filter transactions from that origin
    in the output plugin, rather than trying to forward them without
    origin information.

## BDR 3.6.7 (2019 Aug 30)

BDR 3.6.7 is the seventh minor release of the BDR 3.6 series. This release
includes minor new features as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   CAMO and Eager switched to use two-phase commit (2PC) internally.  
    This is an internal change that made it possible to resolve a
    deadlock and two data divergence issues (see below).  This is a
    node-local change affecting the transaction's origin node
    exclusively and has no effect on the network protocol between BDR
    nodes.  BDR nodes running CAMO now require a configuration change to
    allow for enough `max_prepared_transactions`; see [Upgrading] for
    more details. Note that there is no restriction on the use of
    temporary tables, as exists in explicit 2PC in PostgreSQL.

-   Add globally-allocated range sequences (RM2125)  
    New sequence kind which uses consensus between nodes to assign ranges of
    sequence numbers to individual nodes for each sequence as needed.
    Supports all of smallint, integer and bigint sequences (that includes serial
    column type).

-   Implement Multi-Origin PITR Recovery (EE) (RM5826)  
    BDR will now allow PITR of all or some replication origins to a
    specific point in time, providing a fully consistent viewpoint
    across all subsets of nodes.  For multi-origins, we view the WAL
    stream as containing multiple streams all mixed up into one larger
    stream.  There is still just one PIT, but that will be reached as
    different points for each origin separately.  Thus we use physical
    WAL recovery using multiple separate logical stopping points for
    each origin.  We end up with one LSN "stopping point" in WAL, but
    we also have one single timestamp applied consistently, just as we
    do with "single origin PITR".

-   Add `bdr.xact_replication` option for transaction replication control  
    Allows for skipping replication of whole transaction in a similar way to what
    `bdr.ddl_replication` does for DDL statements but it affects all changes
    including `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE`. Can only be set via `SET LOCAL`.
    Use with care!

-   Prevent accidental manual drop of replication slots created and managed by BDR

-   Add `bdr.permit_unsafe_commands` option to override otherwise disallowed
    commands (RM10148)  
    Currently overrides the check for manual drop of BDR replication slot in
    the Enterprise Edition.

-   Allow setting `bdr.ddl_replication` and `bdr.ddl_locking` as `bdr_superuser`
    using the `SET` command  
    This was previously possible only via the wrapper functions
    `bdr.set_ddl_replication()` and `bdr.set_ddl_locking()` which are still
    available.

-   Improve performance of consensus messaging layer (RM10319, RT65396)

### Resolved Issues

-   Delete additional metadata in `bdr.drop_node` (RT65393, RM10346)  
    We used to keep some of the local node info behind which could prevent
    reuse of the node name.

-   Correctly synchronize node-dependent metadata when using
    `bdr_init_physical` (RT65221, RM10409)  
    Synchronize additional replication sets and table membership in those as
    well as stream triggers and sequence information in `bdr_init_physical`,
    in a similar way to logical synchronization.

-   Fix potential data divergence with CAMO due to network glitch (RM#10147)  
    This fixes an data inconsistency that could arise between the nodes
    of a CAMO pair in case of an unreachable or unresponsive (but
    operational) CAMO partner and a concurrent crash of the CAMO origin
    node.  An in-flight COMMIT of a transaction protected by CAMO may
    have ended up getting committed on one node, but aborted on the
    other, after both nodes are operational and connected.

-   Fix a potential deadlock between a cross-CAMO pair (RM#7907)  
    With two nodes configured as a symmetric CAMO pair, it was possible
    for the pair to deadlock, if both nodes were down and restarting,
    but both having CAMO transactions in-flight.

-   Fix potential data divergence for Eager transaction in face of a crash (RM#9907)  
    In case of a crash of the origin node of an Eager transaction just
    before the final local commit, such a transaction could have ended
    up aborted on the origin but committed on all other nodes. This is
    fixed by using 2PC on the origin node as well and properly resolving
    in-flight Eager transaction after a restart of the origin node.

-   Correct handling of fast shutdown with CAMO transactions in-flight (RM#9556)  
    A fast shutdown of Postgres on a BDR node that's in the process of
    committing a CAMO-protected transaction previously led to a PANIC.
    This is now handled gracefully, with the in-flight CAMO transaction
    still being properly recovered after a restart of that node.

## BDR 3.6.6 (2019 Aug 08)

BDR 3.6.6 is the sixth minor release of the BDR 3.6 series. This release
includes minor new features as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Add `bdr.drop_node()` (RM9938)  
    For removing node metadata from local database, allowing reuse
    of the node name in the cluster.

-   Include `bdr_init_physical` in BDR-SE (RM9892)  
    Improves performance  during large node joins - BDR-EE has included this tool
    for some time.

-   Enhance bdr_init_physical utility in BDR-EE  (RM9988)
    Modify bdr_init_physical to optionally use selective pg_basebackup of only
    the target database as opposed to the earlier behavior of backup of the entire
    database cluster. Should make this activity complete faster and also allow
    it to use less space due to the exclusion of unwanted databases.

-   TRUNCATE is now allowed during eager replicated transactions (RM9812)

-   New `bdr.global_lock_table()` function (RM9735).  
    Allows explicit acquire of global DML lock on a relation. Especially useful
    for avoidance of conflicts when using TRUNCATE with concurrent write
    transactions.

-   New conflict type `update_pkey_exists` (RM9976)  
    Allows conflict resolution when a `PRIMARY KEY` was updated to one which
    already exists on the node which is applying the change.

-   Reword DDL locking skip messages and reduce log level  
    The previous behavior was too intrusive.

-   Add `bdr.apply_log_summary` (RM6596)  
    View over `bdr.apply_log` which shows the human-readable conflict type and
    resolver string instead of internal id.

-   Add `bdr.maximum_clock_skew` and `bdr.maximum_clock_skew_action`
    configuration options (RM9379)  
    For checking clock skew between nodes and either warning or delaying apply
    in case the clock skew is too high.

### Resolved Issues

-   Move CRDT type operators from public schema to `pg_catalog` (RT65280, RM10027)  
    Previously BDR operators were installed in public schema, preventing their
    use by servers implementing stricter security policies. No action required.

-   Remember if unsupported Eager Replication command was run in current
    transaction.  
    This allows us to prevent situations where an unsupported command was run
    while Eager Replication was turned off and later in the transaction the
    Eager Replication is turned on.

-   Fix the "`!`" operator for `crdt_pnsum` data type (RM10156)  
    It's the operator for resetting the value of the column, but in previous
    versions the reset operation didn't work on this type.

## BDR 3.6.5 (2019 Jul 19)

BDR 3.6.5 is the fifth minor release of the BDR 3.6 series. This release
includes minor new features as well as fixes for issues identified in 3.6.4.

### Improvements

-   Allow late enabling of CAMO (RM8886)  
    The setting `bdr.enable_camo` may now be turned on at any point in
    time before a commit, even if the transaction already has an id
    assigned.

-   Add version-2 KSUUIDs which can be compared using simple comparison operators
    (RM9662)

-   New `delete_recently_updated` conflict type (RM9673/RT65063)
    Triggered by `DELETE` operation arriving out of order - the `DELETE` has an
    older commit timestamp than the most recent local `UPDATE` of the row. Can be
    used to override the default policy of `DELETE` always winning.

-   Make bdr admin function replication obey DDL replication filters (RT65174)  
    So that commands like `bdr.replication_set_add_table` don't get replicated
    to a node which didn't replicate `CREATE TABLE` in the first place.

-   Don't require group replication set to be always subscribed by every node (RT65161)  
    Since we now apply DDL replication filters to admin functions, it's no longer
    necessary to force group replication set to be subscribed by every node as
    other replication sets can be configured to replicate the admin function
    calls.

-   Allow a few more DDL operations to skip the global DML lock  
    The following DDL operations have been optimized to acquire only a
    global DDL lock, but not the DML one:

    ```
    - ALTER TABLE .. ALTER COLUMN .. SET STATISTICS
    ```

    -   ALTER TABLE .. VALIDATE CONSTRAINT
        -   ALTER TABLE .. CLUSTER ON
        -   ALTER TABLE .. RESET
    -   CREATE TRIGGER

-   Add new BDR trigger that resolves Foreign Key anomalies on DELETE (RM9580)

-   Add new function bdr.run_on_all_nodes() to assist monitoring and diagnostics (RM9945)

-   Extend the CAMO reference client in C  
    Allow setting a `bdr.commit_scope` for test transactions.

-   Prevent replication of CLUSTER command to avoid operational impact

-   To assist with security and general diagnostics, any DDL that skips
    replication or global DDL locking at user request will be logged. For regular
    users of non-replicated and/or non-logged DDL this may increase log volumes.
    Some log messages have changed in format. This change comes into effect when
    `bdr.ddl_locking = off` and/or `bdr.ddl_replication = off`.

-   Greatly enhance descriptions of BDR admin functions with regard to (RM8345)  
    their operational impact, replication, locking and transactional nature

-   Detailed docs to explain concurrent Primary Key UPDATE scenarios (RM9873/RT65156) 

-   Document examples of using bdr.replication_set_add_ddl_filter() (RM9691) 

### Resolved Issues

-   Rework replication of replication set definition (RT64451)  
    Solves the issue with the replication set disappearing from some nodes that
    could happen in certain situations.
-   Acquire a Global DML lock for these DDL commands for correctness (RM9650)  
    -   CREATE UNIQUE INDEX CONCURRENTLY
    -   DROP INDEX CONCURRENTLY
    -   bdr.drop_trigger() admin function
        since adding or removing any constraint could allow replication-halting DML
-   Correctly ignore nodes that are parting or parted in the Raft code (RM9666/RT64891)  
    Removes the excessive logging of node membership changes.
-   Don't try to do CRDT/CLCD merge on `update_recently_deleted` (RM9674)  
    It's strictly row-level conflict; doing a merge would produce the wrong results.
-   Allow BDR apps that require standard_conforming_strings = off (RM9573/RT64949)
-   Use replication slot metadata to postpone freezing of rows (RM9670) (EE-only)  
    Otherwise an update_origin_change conflict might get undetected after a period
    of node downtime or disconnect. The SE version can only avoid this using parameters.
-   Correct bdr_wait_slot_confirm_lsn() to wait for the LSN of last commit, rather  
    than the LSN of the current write position. In some cases that could have released
    the wait earlier than appropriate, and in other cases it might have been delayed.

## BDR 3.6.4 (2019 Jun 20)

BDR 3.6.4 is the fourth minor release of the BDR 3.6 series. This release
includes minor new features as well as fixes for issues identified in 3.6.3.

### The Highlights of BDR 3.6.4

-   Apply statistics tracking (RM9063)  
    We now track statistics about replication and resource use for individual
    subscriptions and relations and make them available in the
    `pglogical.stat_subscription` and `pglogical.stat_relation` views.
    The tracking can be configured via the `pglogical.stat_track_subscription`
    and `pglogical.stat_track_relation` configuration parameters.
-   Support CAMO client protocol with Eager All Node Replication  
    Extend `bdr.logical_transaction_status` to be able to query the
    status of transactions replicated in global commit scope (Eager All
    Node Replication). Add support for Eager All Node Replication in
    the Java CAMO Reference client.

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix initial data copy of multi-level partitioned tables (RT64809)  
    The initial data copy used to support only single level partitioning;
    multiple levels of partitioning are now supported.
-   Don't try to copy initial data twice for partitions in some situations (RT64809)  
    The initial data copy used to try to copy data from all tables that are in
    replication sets without proper regard to partitioning. This could result in
    partition data being copied twice if both the root partition and individual
    partitions were published via the replication set. This is now solved; we only
    do the initial copy on the root partition if it's published.
-   Fix handling of indexes when replicating INSERT to a partition (RT64809)  
    Close the indexes correctly in all situations.
-   Improve partitioning test coverage (RM9311)  
    In light of the partitioning related issues, increase the amount of
    automated testing done against partitioned tables.
-   Fix merging of `crdt_pnsum` data type (RT64975)  
    The internal index was handled wrongly, potentially causing a segmentation
    fault; this is now resolved.
-   Fix cache lookup failed on database without BDR extension installed (RM9217)  
    This could previously lead to errors when dropping tables on a PostgreSQL
    instance which has the BDR library loaded but does not have the extension
    installed.
-   Fix permission issues on `bdr.subscription_summary` (RT64945)  
    No need to have permissions on `pglogical.get_sub_progress_timestamp()` to
    use this view anymore.
-   Cleanup prepared Eager All Node transactions after failures (RM8996)  
    Prevents inconsistencies and hangs due to unfinished transactions
    after node or network failures.  Uses Raft to ensure consistency
    between the nodes for the cleanup of such dangling prepared
    transactions.

### Other Improvements

-   The `replicate_inserts` option now affects initial COPY  
    We now do initial copy of data only if the table replicates inserts.
-   Lower log level for internal node management inside Raft worker (RT64891)  
    This was needlessly spamming logs during node join or parting.
-   Warn when executing DDL without DDL replication or without DDL locking  
    The DDL commands executed without DDL replication or locking can lead to
    divergent databases and cause replication errors so it's prudent to warn
    about them.
-   Allow create statistics without dml lock (RM9507)
-   Change documentation to reflect the correct default settings for the
    update_missing conflict type.

## BDR 3.6.3 (2019 May 30)

BDR 3.6.3 is the third minor release of the BDR 3.6 series. This release
includes minor new features as well as fixes for issues identified in 3.6.2.

### The Highlights of BDR 3.6.3

-   Add btree/hash operator classes for CRDT types (EE, RT64319)
    This allows the building of indexes on CRDT columns (using the scalar value)
    and the querying of them them using simple equality/inequality clauses, using
    the in GROUP BY clauses etc.
-   Add implicit casts from int4/int8 for CRDT sum types (EE, RT64600)  
    To allow input using expressions with integer and CRDT sum types together. For example:

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE t (c bdr.crdt_gsum NOT NULL DEFAULT 0);
    ```
-   New `update_recently_deleted` conflict type (RM8574)  
    Conflicts are handled differently for the special case of `update_missing`
    when BDR detects that the row being updated is missing because it was just
    recently deleted. See UPDATE/DELETE Conflicts in the documentation for details.
-   Allow DDL operations in CAMO protected transactions, making automatic disabling of
    CAMO obsolete (EE, RT64769)
-   Add the connection status checking function `bdr.is_camo_partner_connected`
    for CAMO (EE). See the Commit At Most Once documentation for details.
-   Persist the last_xact_replay_timestamp (RT63881)  
    So that it's visible even if the subscription connection is down (or remote
    node is down).
-   Major documentation improvements  
    Copy-edit sentences to make more sense, add extra clarifying info where the
    original wording was confusing.

### Resolved Issues

-   Use group locking for global DML lock (RT64404)  
    This allows better cooperation between the global DML locker and the writers
    which are doing catch up of the remaining changes.

### Other Improvements

-   Support mixed use of legacy CRDT types and new CRDT types which are in bdr schema  
    Implicitly cast between the two so their mixed usage and potential migration
    is transparent.
-   Improve static code scanning  
    Every build is scanned both by Coverity and Clang scan-build.
-   Log changes of `bdr.ddl_replication` and `bdr.ddl_locking`  
    Helps with troubleshooting when divergent DDL was run.
-   Rework documentation build procedure for better consistency between HTML and
    PDF documentation. This mainly changes the way docs are structured into
    chapters so that there is a single source of chapter list and ordering for
    both PDF and HTML docs.

## BDR 3.6.2 (2019 May 09)

BDR 3.6.2 is the second minor release of the BDR 3.6 series. This release includes minor new features as well as fixes for issues identified in 3.6.1

### The Highlights of BDR 3.6.2

-   All the SQL visible interfaces are now moved to the `bdr` schema (EE)  
    The CRDT types and per column conflict resolution interfaces are now in the
    `bdr` schema instead of `bdr_crdt` and `bdr_conflicts`. The types and public
    interfaces still exist in those schemas for compatibility with existing
    installations, however their use is not recommended as they are now deprecated
    and may be removed in a future release. Please use the ones in `bdr` schema.
    Documentation only contains references to the `bdr` schema now as well.
-   Add `bdr.node_conflict_resolvers` view (RT64388)  
    Shows current conflict resolver setting for each conflict type on the local
    node including the defaults.
-   Add a CAMO Reference Client implementation in C and Java to the documentation.
-   Support DEFERRED UNIQUE indexes  
    They used to work only in limited cases before this release.

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix consensus request timeout during leader election (RT64569)  
    The timeout wasn't applied when the leader was unknown leading to immediate
    failures of any action requiring consensus (for example global DDL locking).
    This is now resolved.
-   Improve cleanup on failure during a DDL locked operation, This speeds up DDL
    locking subsystem recovery after error so that errors don't create a cascading 
    effect.
-   Unify the replication of admin function commands (RT64544)  
    This makes the replication and locking behavior of administration function
    commands more in-line with DDL in all situations, including logical standby.
-   Support covering UNIQUE indexes (RT64650)  
    Previously, the covering UNIQUE indexes could result in ambiguous error
    messages in some cases.
-   Switch to monotonic time source for Raft timing (RM6390)  
    This improves reliability of Raft internal timing in presence of time jumps
    caused by NTPd and similar. As a result Raft reliability is improved in general.
-   Improve locking in the internal connection pooler  
    For more reliable messaging between nodes.
-   Restore consensus protocol version on restart (RT64526)  
    This removes the need for renegotiation every time a consensus worker or a node
    is restarted, making the features depending on newer protocol version consistently
    available across restarts.
-   Correct automatic disabling and re-enabling of bdr.enable_camo when using
    DDL in a transaction. Ensure it cannot be manually re-enabled within the same
    transaction.
-   Fix handling of CAMO confirmations arriving early, before the origin starts
    to wait. This prevents timeouts due to such a confirmation being ignored.

## BDR 3.6.1 (2019 Apr 23)

BDR 3.6.1 is the first minor release of the BDR 3.6 series. This release includes minor new features and fixes including all the fixes from 3.6.0.1 and 3.6.0.2.

### The highlights of 3.6.1

-   Add `bdr.role_replication` configuration option (RT64330)  
    The new option controls the replication of role management statements (`CREATE/ALTER/DROP/GRANT ROLE`). This option is dependent on `bdr.ddl_replication` as the role management statements still obey the standard rules of the DDL replication. By default this is set to `on`, meaning that these statements are replicated if executed in a BDR-enabled database.
-   Add `--standby` option to `bdr_init_physical` (RM8543, EE)  
    Allows the creation of a logical standby using `bdr_init_physical`;
    previously only a full blown send/receive node could be created this way.
-   Add `last_xact_replay_timestamp` to `bdr.subscription_summary` (RT63881)  
    Shows the commit timestamp of the last replayed transaction by the subscription.
-   Stop join on unrecoverable error (RT64463)  
    Join might fail during the structure synchronization, which currently is an unrecoverable error. Instead of retrying like for other (transient) errors, just part the joining node and inform the user that there was an error.

### Resolved Issues

-   Improve the trigger security checking (RT64412)  
    Allow triggers to have a different owner than the table if the trigger uses bdr or pglogical trigger functions, security definer functions (as those redefine security anyway) and also always allow replication set membership changes during initial replication set synchronization during the node join.
-   Make BDR replicated commands obey `bdr.ddl_replication` (RT64479)  
    Some of the BDR function calls (like `bdr_conflicts.column_timestamps_enable`) are replicated in a similar way as normal DDL commands including the DDL locking as appropriate. These commands in previous versions of BDR however ignored the `bdr.ddl_replication` setting and were always replicated. This is now fixed. In addition just like normal DDL, these commands are now never replicated from the logical standby.
-   Don't try to replicate generic commands on global objects  
    Several commands on global objects would be replicated even in situations where they shouldn't be because of how they are represented internally. Handling of the following commands has been fixed:
    -   `ALTER ROLE/DATABASE/TABLESPACE ... RENAME TO`
    -   `ALTER DATABASE/TABLESPACE ... OWNER TO`
    -   `COMMENT ON ROLE/DATABASE/TABLESPACE`
    -   `SECURITY LABEL ON ROLE/DATABASE/TABLESPACE`
-   Properly timeout on CAMO partner and switch to Local mode (RT64390, EE)  
    Disregard the connection status of other BDR nodes and switch to Local mode as soon as the designated CAMO partner node fails.  Makes the switch to Local mode work in a four or more node cluster.

## BDR 3.6.0.2 (2019 Apr 16)

The BDR 3.6.0.2 release is the second bug-fix release in the BDR 3.6 series.

### Resolved Issues

-   Dynamic disabling of CAMO upon the first DDL (EE, RT64403)
-   Fix hang in node join caused by timing issues when restoring Raft snapshot (RT64433)
-   Fix the trigger function ownership checks (RT64412)
-   Improve behavior of `promote_node` and `join_node_group` with `wait_for_completion := false`

## BDR 3.6.0.1 (2019 Apr 11)

The BDR 3.6.0.1 is the first bug-fix release in the BDR 3.6 series.

### Resolved Issues

-   Support `target_table_missing` conflict for transparent partitioning (EE) (RT64389)
-   Fix message broker sometimes discarding messages (common side-effect are DDL locking timeouts)
-   Raft protocol negotiations improvements
-   Fixed memory leak in tracing code
-   Improve synchronous `remote_write` replication performance (RT64397)
-   Fixed commit timestamp variant handling of CLCD (EE)
-   Re-add support for binary protocol
-   Correct Local mode for CAMO with `synchronous_replication_availability = 'async'` (EE)
-   Disallow and provide a hint for unsupported operations in combination with CAMO (EE).
-   Fix deadlock in `logical_transaction_status` (EE)

## BDR 3.6.0 (2019 Apr 04)

The version 3.6 of BDR3 is a major update which brings improved CAMO, performance improvements, better conflict handling and bug fixes.

### The highlights of BDR 3.6

-   Differentiate BDR RemoteWrite mode and set `write_lsn`
-   Significant replication performance improvement
    -   Cache table synchronization state
    -   Only send keepalives when necessary
    -   Only do flush when necessary
    -   Serialize transactions in fewer cases in wal sender (2ndQPostgres)
-   Improved replication position reporting which is more in line with how physical streaming replication reports it
-   Conflict detection and resolution improvements
    -   Add new types of conflicts (like `target_table_missing`)
    -   Add new types of conflict resolvers
    -   Make conflict resolution configurable per node and conflict type
    -   Improve conflict detection for updates
-   Simplification of CAMO configuration (EE)
-   Performance improvements for CAMO (EE)

### Resolved issues

-   Fix reporting of replay lag (RT63866)
-   Fix CRDTs and conflict triggers for repeated UPDATEs of same row in transaction (RT64297)
-   Don't try to replicate REINDEX of temporary indexes

### Other improvements

-   Improved vacuum handling of Raft tables
-   Improve and clarify CAMO documentation (EE)
