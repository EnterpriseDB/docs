## pglogical 3.7.17

This is a maintenance release for pglogical 3.7 which includes minor
improvements as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Resolved Issues

- Fix spurious pglogical receiver timeouts on idle connections (RT82315)  
  When there is nothing to replicate and apply, the pglogical receiver may
  misinterpret the state as timeout and exit with error "ERROR:  08006:
  terminating pglogical receiver due to timeout". Correct this
  misinterpretation to prevent spurious restarts of the receiver and writer
  processes.

### Upgrades

This release supports upgrading from following versions of pglogical:

 - 3.7.9 and higher
 - 3.6.29 and higher
 - 2.4.0 and 2.4.1

## pglogical 3.7.16

This is a maintenance release for pglogical 3.7 which includes minor
improvements as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Resolved Issues

-   Keep the `lock_timeout` as configured on non-CAMO-partner BDR nodes (BDR-1916)  
    A CAMO partner uses a low `lock_timeout` when applying transactions
    from its origin node.  This was inadvertently done for all BDR nodes
    rather than just the CAMO partner, which may have led to spurious
    `lock_timeout` errors on pglogical writer processes on normal BDR
    nodes.

-   Prevent walsender processes spinning when facing lagging standby slots (RT80295, RT78290)  
    Correct signaling to reset a latch so that a walsender process does
    consume 100% of a CPU in case one of the standby slots is lagging
    behind.

-   Provide a proper error when attempting to use `pglogical.use_spi` (RT76368)

-   Reduce log information when switching between writer processes (BDR-2196)

-   Eliminate a memory leak when replicating partitioned tables (RT80981, BDR-2194)

### Upgrades

This release supports upgrading from following versions of pglogical:

-   3.7.9 and higher
-   3.6.29 and higher
-   2.4.0 and 2.4.1

## pglogical 3.7.15

This is a maintenance release for pglogical 3.7 which includes minor
improvements as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Add `pglogical.max_worker_backoff_delay` (BDR-1767)
    This changes the handling of the backoff delay to exponentially
    increase from `pglogical.min_worker_backoff_delay` to
    `pglogical.max_worker_backoff_delay` in presence of repeated errors.  This
    reduces log spam and in some cases also prevents unnecessary
    connection attempts.

### Resolved Issues

-   For the view `pglogical.subscriptions`, ensure the correct value is displayed
    in the `provider_dsn` column (BDR-1859)  
    Previously the subscriber node's DSN was being displayed.

-   Fix handling of `wal_receiver_timeout` (BDR-1848)  
    The `wal_receiver_timeout` has not been triggered correctly due to a regression
    in BDR 3.7 and 4.0.

-   Limit the `pglogical.standby_slot_names` check when reporting flush position only to
    physical slots (RT77985, RT78290)  
    Otherwise flush progress is not reported in presence of disconnected nodes when
    using `pglogical.standby_slot_names`.

-   Confirm LSN of LCR slot progress records when recovering LCR segments (BDR-1264)

-   Fix replication of data types created during bootstrap (BDR-1784)

### Upgrades

This release supports upgrading from following versions of pglogical:

-   3.7.9 and higher
-   3.6.29 and higher
-   2.4.0 and 2.4.1

## pglogical 3.7.14

This is a maintenance release for pglogical 3.7 which includes minor
improvements as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Implement buffered read for LCR segment file (BDR-1422)  
    This should reduce both I/O operations done by decoding worker as well as the
    amount of signalling between the decoding worker and wal senders which results
    in improved performance when decoding worker is used.

### Resolved Issues

-   Invalidate output plugin's replication set cache when published replication sets
    change (BDR-1715)  
    This ensures that published replicated sets are always up to date when user
    changes what should be published on node level. Before this fix, the old
    settings would have been applied until downstream has reconnected.
    This primarily affects BDR in situations where the `bdr.alter_node_replication_sets`
    was called on multiple nodes in quick succession.

-   Don't try to retry transaction replication when writer receives SIGTERM or SIGINT  
    This would unnecessarily hold back the shutdown of postgres when parallel apply
    is enabled.

-   Log correct error message during initial schema synchronization error (BDR-1598)  
    Previously we'd always log ERROR with message "Success" which is not helpful for
    troubleshooting.

### Upgrades

This release supports upgrading from following versions of pglogical:

-   3.7.9 and higher
-   3.6.29 and higher
-   2.4.0
-   2.4.1

## pglogical 3.7.13

This is a maintenance release for pglogical 3.7 which includes minor
improvements as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Allow the BDR consensus process to use a (sub) replorigin (BDR-1613)  
    For parallel apply, multiple writers could use invididual origins
    that would be merged, thus act kind of as child origins for a main
    or parent origin.
    Extend this mechanism to allow the BDR consensus process to also
    register an origin participating in the group.

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix the replication protocol handling of some strings (RT74123)  
    Certain strings like e.g. relation schema, relation name, attribute
    name, and message prefix were mistakenly changed to not include a
    terminating NULL character.  This led to a protocol incompatibility
    when interoperating with PGLogical 3.5.3 and older or when WAL
    messages are used (e.g. due to the use of BDR features CAMO or Eager
    All Node Replication).

-   Fix segfault when creating a subscription with the RabbitMQ writer plugin (BDR-1482, RT72434)  

-   Don't wait on own replication slot when waiting for `standby_slot_names` (RT74036)  
    The walsenders that use slots named in `standby_slot_names` should not
    wait for anything, otherwise it might wait forever.

-   Reduce logging when WAL decoder is not available (BDR-1041)  
    `pgl_xact_fully_decoded()` will log a message when it finds that
    the WAL decoder is not running. WAL decoder may not start for long
    duration and thus this log line will repeat and increase the log file
    size. There are other ways to know whether WAL decoder is running. So
    this line is not required.

-   Handle deprecated `update_differing` and `update_recently_deleted` (BDR-1610, RT74973)  
    While upgrading to 3.7, take care of the deprecated conflict types
    otherwise, as they would be unknown to the new version, it would
    not know how to handle them and break the upgrade process.

-   Enable async conflict resolution for explicit 2PC (BDR-1609, RT71298)  
    Continue applying the transaction using the async conflict resolution
    for explicit two phase commit.

### Upgrades

This release supports upgrading from following versions of pglogical:

-   3.7.9 and higher
-   3.6.28
-   2.4.0
-   2.4.1

## pglogical 3.7.12

This is a maintenance release for pglogical 3.7 which includes minor
improvements as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Add replication status monitoring (BDR-865)  
    Track the connection establishment and drops, the number of
    transactions committed as well as the restart LSN to detect repeated
    restarts and diagnose stalled replication.

-   Improve performance when used in combination with synchronous replication (BDR-1398)  
    Override `synchronous_commit` to `local'` for all PGLogical
    processes performing only bookkeeping transactions which do not need
    to be replicated.  Only the PGLogical writer processes applying user
    transactions need to follow the `synchronous_commit` mode configured
    for synchronous replication.

-   Internal improvements and additional hooks to better support BDR

### Resolved Issues

-   Performance improvements for Decoding Worker (BDR-1311, BDR-1357)
    Speed up lookups of the WAL decoder worker, reduce delays after
    reaching up to the LSN proviously known to be decoded by the
    Decoding Worker, and reduce number of system calls when writing one
    LCR chunk to an LCR segment file.

-   Improve compatibility with Postgres 13 (BDR-1396)  
    Adjust to an API change in ReplicationSlotAcquire that may have led
    to unintended blocking when non-blocking was requestend and vice
    versa.  This version of PGLogical eliminates this potential problem,
    which has not been observed on production systems so far.

### Upgrades

This release supports upgrading from following versions of pglogical:

-   3.7.9 and higher
-   3.6.27
-   2.4.0

## pglogical 3.7.11

This is a maintenance release for pglogical 3.7 which includes minor
improvements as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Resolved Issues

-   Add protection against malformed parameter values in pgl output plugin  
    This fixes potential crash when some parameters sent to the output plugin
    were malformed.

-   Get copy of slot tuple when logging conflict (BDR-734)  
    Otherwise we could materialize the row early causing wrong update in presence
    of additional columns on the downstream.

-   Use a separate memory context for processing LCRs (BDR-1237, RT72165)  
    This fixes memory leak when using the decoding worker feature of BDR.

-   Truncate LCR segment file after recovery (BDR-1236, BDR-1259)  
    This fixes memory errors reported by the decoding worker after crash.

-   Ensure `pg_read_and_filter_lcr` will exit when postmaster dies
    (BDR-1226, BDR-1209, RT72083)  
    Solves issues with hanging decoder worker on shutdown.

-   Fix memory leak in the pglogical COPY handler (BDR-1219, RT72091)  
    This fixes memory leak when synchronizing large tables.

-   Allow binary and internal protocol on more hardware combinations. This
    currently only affects internal testing.

### Upgrades

This release supports upgrading from following versions of pglogical:

-   3.7.9 and higher
-   3.6.27
-   2.4.0

## pglogical 3.7.10

This is a maintenance release for pglogical 3.7 which includes minor
improvements as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Windows support improvements (BDR-976, BDR-1083)

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix potential crash during cleanup of bulk copy replication (BDR-1168)

-   Fix issues in generic WAL message handling when the WAL message was produced
    by something other than pglogical (BDR-670)

-   Redefine `werr_age` of `pglogical.worker_error_summary` to report correct age

-   Only use key attributes of covering unique index when used as replica identity
    This only affects what is being sent over network, no logic change.

## pglogical 3.7.9

This is a maintenance release for pglogical 3.7 which includes minor
improvements as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Support two-phase commit transaction with Decoding Worker (BDR-811)  

    A two-phase commit transaction is completely decoded and sent downstream when
    processing its PREPARE WAL record. COMMIT/ROLLBACK PREPARED is replicated
    separately when processing the corresponding WAL record.

-   Reduce writes to `pg_replication_origin` when using parallel apply (RT71077)  
    Previously, especially on EPAS pglogical could produce thousands of dead rows
    in `pg_replication_origin` system catalog if it had connection problems to
    upstream.

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix flush queue truncation (BDR-890)  
    During queue compaction flush to correct LSN instead of always truncating
    whole flush queue.

-   Fix the pglogical.worker_error columns `werr_worker_index` and `werr_time`  
    Used to report wrong values.

-   Fix snapshot handling in internal executor usage (BDR-904)  
    Row filtering didn't correctly pushed snapshot in some situations.

    Caught thanks to upcoming change in PostgreSQL that double checks for this.

-   Fix handling of domains over arrays and composite types (BDR-29)  
    The replication protocol previously could not always handle columns using
    domains over arrays and domains over composite types.

## pglogical 3.7.8

This is a first stable release of the pglogical 3.7.

pglogical 3.7 is a major release of pglogical. This release includes
major new features as well as smaller enhancements.

Upgrades are supported from pglogical 3.6.25 and 3.7.7 in this release.

### Improvements

-   Allow parallel apply on EDB Advanced Server (EE)

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix divergence after physical failover (BDR-365, RT68894 and RM19886)  
    Make sure that we don't report back LSN on subscriber that
    hasn't been received by named standbys (pglogical.standby_slot_names).

    This will ensure provider side keeps slot position behind
    far enough so that if subscriber is replaced by one of said
    named standbys, the standby will be able to fetch any missing
    replication stream from the original provider.

-   Fix crash when ERROR happened during fast shutdown of pglogical writer

-   Don't re-enter worker error handling loop recursively (BDR-667)  
    This should help make what happens clearer in any cases where we do
    encounter errors during error processing.

-   Assign collation to the index scan key (BDR-561)  
    When doing lookups for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, either to find conflicts
    or key for the operation to be applied, we should use correct collation.

    This fixes index lookups for index on textual fields on Postgres 12+.

-   Use `name` data type for known fixed length fields (BDR-561)  
    This solves potential index collation issues with pglogical catalogs.

-   Progress WAL sender's slot based on WAL decoder input (BDR-567)  
    Without slot progression the server will eventually stop working.

-   Fix begin of transaction write when LCR file does not have enough space (BDR-606)

-   Restart decoding a transaction that was not completed in single decoding worker (BDR-247)  
    If we crashed during a long transaction that spawns on more then one lcr file
    we start decoding again from the lsn of the beginning of the transaction and
    find the last lcr file where we can write into.

-   Generate temp slot with correct length in subscription sync  
    Otherwise the name of the slot might be shortened by Postgres leading to
    confusion on the slot cleanup.

-   Improve detection of mixing temporary and nontemporary objects in DDLs (BDR-485)  
    These can break replication so it's important to not allow them.

-   Fix pre-commit message handling in Eager replication (BDR-492)

-   Override GUCs in all pglogical workers, not just in writers.

## pglogical 3.7.7

This is a beta release of the pglogical 3.7.

pglogical 3.7 is a major release of pglogical. This release includes
major new features as well as smaller enhancements.

Upgrades are supported from pglogical 3.6.25 and 3.7.6 in this release.

### Improvements

-   Use parallel apply during initial sync during logical join

-   Add worker process index to the worker_error catalog (BDR-229)  
    The column `werr_worker_index` in worker_error table keeps track
    of the writers for the same subscription.

-   Various improvements for WAL decoder/sender coordination (BDR-232, BDR-335)

-   Name LCR segment similar to XLOG segments (BDR-236, BDR-253, BDR-321, BDR-322)  
    An LCR segment file is identified by five 8-digit hex numbers.
    Timeline first group, XLOG the next two groups and file number the last
    two groups.

### Resolved Issues

-   Restrict adding queue table to the replication set. (EDBAS, EBD-45)

-   Fix deadlock between receiver and writer during queue flush (BDR-483)

-   Force and wait for all writers to exit when one writer dies (BDR-229)

-   Name LCR directory after the replication slot (BDR-60)  
    Logical output plugin may be used by multiple replication slots. Store
    the LCRs from a given replication slot in a directory named after that
    replication slot to avoid mixing LCRs for different slots.

-   Fix EXPLAIN...INTO TABLE replication issue (EBC-46)

## pglogical 3.7.6

This is a beta release of the pglogical 3.7.

pglogical 3.7 is a major release of pglogical. This release includes
major new features as well as smaller enhancements.

Upgrades are supported from pglogical 3.6.25 in this release.

### Improvements

-   Enable parallel apply for CAMO and Eager (RM17858)

-   Improve error handling in Eager/CAMO, especially with parallel apply
    (BDR-106)  

-   Reduce severity of Eager/CAMO feedback errors

-   Add infrastructure necessary for allowing separation of WAL decoding from
    WalSender process in BDR (RM18868, BDR-51, BDR-60)

### Resolved Issues

-   Improve relcache invalidation handling in heap writer  
    This should solve missed invalidations after opening table for DML apply.

-   Wait for the writer that has XID assigned rather then one that doesn't
    (BDR-137)  
    This fixes deadlock in parallel apply when there is a mix of empty and
    non-empty transactions where the non-empty ones conflict.

-   Correct writer state tracking for Eager/CAMO (BDR-107)

-   Correct and improve CAMO misconfiguration handling (BDR-105)  
    Properly abort the transaction in case of sync CAMO, so the internal
    state of the PGL writer is cleared

-   Fix transaction state tracking for CAMO/Eager  
    Do not abort the transaction at pre-commit time for non-CAMO nodes, but
    keep it open until the final commit.  Adjust the transaction state
    tracking accordingly

-   Fix MERGE handling in 2ndQPostgres 12 and 13  
    We'd before allow the MERGE command on replicated tables without appropriate
    REPLICA IDENTITY which could result in broken replication.

-   Fix CAMO feedback sending (RM17858)  
    Fixes stalls in CAMO feedback, improving performance compared to previous
    3.7 beta releases. This is especially visible with parallel apply enabled.

## pglogical 3.7.5

This is a beta release of the pglogical 3.7.

pglogical 3.7 is a major release of pglogical. This release includes
major new features as well as smaller enhancements.

### Improvements

-   Optimize utility command processing (RT69617)
    For commands that won't affect any DB objects and don't affect
    pglogical we can skip the processing early without reading any
    pglogical or system catalogs or calling to DDL replication plugin
    interfaces. This is optimization for systems with large number of
    such utility command calls (that is primarily applications that
    do explicit transaction management).

-   Add upgrade path from pglogical 2.

### Resolved Issues

-   Ensure that `pglogical.standby_slot_names` takes effect when
    `pglogical.standby_slots_min_confirmed` is at the default value
    of -1.

    On 3.6.21 and older `pglogical.standby_slot_names` was ignored
    if `pglogical.standby_slot_names` is set to zero (RM19042).

    Clusters satisfying the following conditions may experience inter-node
    data consistency issues after a provider failover:

    -   Running pglogical 3.0.0 through to 3.6.21 inclusive;
    -   Using pglogical subscriptions/or providers directly (BDR3-managed
        subscriptions between pairs of BDR3 nodes are unaffected);
    -   Have a physical standby (streaming replica) of a pglogical provider
        intended as a failover candidate;
    -   Have `pglogical.standby_slot_names` on the provider configured to list that
        physical standby;
    -   Have left `pglogical.standby_slots_min_confirmed` unconfigured or set it
        explicitly to zero;

    This issue can cause inconsistencies between pglogical provider and subscriber
    and/or between multiple subscribers when a provider is replaced using
    physical replication based failover. It's possible for the subscriber(s) to
    receive transactions committed to the pre-promotion original provider
    that will not exist on the post-promotion replacement provider. This
    causes provider/subscriber divergence. If multiple subscribers are
    connected to the provider, each subscriber could also receive a different
    subset of transactions from the pre-promotion provider, leading to
    inter-subscriber divergence as well.

    The `pglogical.standby_slots_min_confirmed` now defaults to the newly
    permitted value `-1`, meaning "all slots listed in
    `pglogical.standby_slot_names`". The default of 0 on previous releases
    was intended to have that effect, but instead effectively disabled
    physical-before-logical replication.

    To work around the issue on older versions the operator is advised to
    set `pglogical.standby_slots_min_confirmed = 100` in `postgresql.conf`.
    This has no effect unless `pglogical.standby_slot_names` is also set.

    No action is generally required for this issue on BDR3 clusters.
    BDR3 has its own separate protections to ensure consistency during
    promotion of replicas.

-   Fix pglogical_create_subscriber when "-v" is passed.
    It will make pg_ctl emit meaningful information, making it easier to
    debug issues where pg_ctl fails

## pglogical 3.7.4

This is a beta release of the pglogical 3.7.

pglogical 3.7 is a major release of pglogical. This release includes
major new features as well as smaller enhancements.

### Improvements

-   Support PostgreSQL 13

-   Add `pglogical.replication_origin_status` view (RM17074)  
    Same as `pg_replication_origin_status` but does not require superuser
    permissions to access it.

-   Beta support of upgrades from 3.6 (currently from 3.6.22)

-   Improved SystemTAP support

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix race condition in replication table filtering which could cause
    crash (RM18839)  
    The cached info about table might get invalidated while used which would
    crash the backend during one of the following operations:

    -   reading the pglogical.tables view
    -   new subcription creation
    -   table resynchronization

-   Don't do transparent DDL replication on commands that affect temporary objects (RM19491, RT69170)  
    These are likely to not exist on the subscription.

-   Only run pgl specific code in deadlock detector when inside writer (RM18402)  
    It's not relevant in user backends and would cause ERRORs there.

## pglogical 3.7.3

This is a beta release of the pglogical 3.7.

pglogical 3.7 is a major release of pglogical. This release includes
major new features as well as smaller enhancements.

### Improvements

-   Parallel Apply (RM6503)
    Allows configuring number of writers per subscriptions. By default this is
    still 1, which mean parallel apply is off by default but can be enabled
    both globally (`pglogical.writers_per_subscription`) and per subscription
    (`num_writers` option in `pglogical.create_subscription()` and
    `pglogical.alter_subscription_num_writers()`).

-   Split "replicating" subscription status into two statuses  
    One is still "replicating" and is reported only if something was actually
    replicated by the subcription since last worker start. The other is "started"
    and just means that the worker for the subscription is running at the time
    the status query was executed.  
    This should reduce confusion where subscription would report "replicating"
    status but worker is in restart loop due to an apply error.

-   Substantial test and testing framework improvements

-   Improve 2ndQPostgres and BDR version dependency handling (RM17024)

-   Add PostgreSQL 12 support to `pglogical_create_subscriber`

-   Rework table resynchronization to use separate receiver process from the
    main one  
    This improves performance of both main apply (primarily latency) and the
    resynchronization itself.  
    It also fixes potential issue where table could be considered synchronized
    before the catchup finished completely.

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix crash on resynchronization of large partitioned tables (RM18154, RM15733,
    RT68455, RT68352)  
    The resync process would keep crashing due to cache invalidation race
    condition if the `COPY` took very long or if there was DDL activity on the
    copied table during the `COPY`.

-   Prohibit MERGE and UPSERT on a table without replica identity (RM17323, RT68146)
    These commands can end up doing `UPDATE` which will break replication if
    the table has no replica identity as the downstream has no way to find the
    matching row for updating.

-   Resolve relcache reference leak reports (RM16956)
    Close the relation correctly in `pglogical.show_repset_tables_info()`

-   Resolve rare crash in HeapWriter row cleanup code (RM16956)

-   Resolve rare crash on worker exit (RM11686)  
    If a pglogical worker exited before it finished initialization it could
    crash instead of exiting cleanly.

-   Fix apply errors parallel index rebuild afrer `TRUNCATE` (RM17602)  

## pglogical 3.7.2

This is a beta release of the pglogical 3.7.

pglogical 3.7 is a major release of pglogical. This release includes
major new features as well as smaller enhancements.

pglogical 3.7 introduces several major new features as well as
architectural changes some of which affect backward compatibility with
existing applications.

### Important Notes

-   Beta software is not supported in production - for application test only

-   Upgrade from 3.6 is not supported in this release, yet.

### Improvements

-   Add support for Postgres 12, deprecate support for older versions  
    pglogical 3.7 now requires at least Postgres 10 and supports up to
    Postgres 12.

### Resolved Issues

-   Keep open the connection until pglogical_create_subscriber finishes (RM13649)  
    Set idle_in_transaction_session_timeout to 0 so we avoid any user setting
    that could close the connection and invalidate the snapshot.
