A subscription is the receiving side (or downstream) of the pglogical
replication setup. Just like on the upstream, the subscription first needs
local node to be created (see [#Nodes](nodes)).

## Subscription information

## pglogical.stat_subscription

Apply statistics for each subscription. Only contains data if the tracking
is enabled.

## `pglogical.replication_status`

Replication status view for each subscription. We consider replication
to be blocked when the subscription has restarted from the same LSN at
least twice and not a single transaction is yet applied after the
current upstream connection was established. If the very first
transaction after restart is very big and still being applied, the
`replication_blocked` result maybe wrong.

### pglogical.create_subscription

Creates a subscription from the current node to the provider node. Command
does not block, just initiates the action.

#### Synopsis

```sql
pglogical.create_subscription (
    subscription_name name,
    provider_dsn text,
    replication_sets text[],
    synchronize_structure boolean,
    synchronize_data boolean,
    create_slot boolean,
    slot_name text,
    forward_origins text[],
    strip_origins boolean,
    num_writers int,
    apply_delay interval,
    writer name,
    writer_options text[]
)
```

The `subscription_name` is used as `application_name` by the replication
connection. This means that it's visible in the `pg_stat_replication`
monitoring view. It can also be used in `synchronous_standby_names` when
pglogical is used as part of the synchronous replication setup.

Subscription setup is asynchronous. `pglogical.create_subscription` returns
after creating the replication slot (unless `create_slot` is false) but
before the subscription is synchronized and streaming. Use
`pglogical.wait_for_subscription_sync_complete` to wait until the subscription
is up and has completed any requested schema and/or data sync.

`synchronize_structure` internally uses `pg_dump` and `pg_restore` to copy schema
definitions. If more than one upstream is being subscribed to, only use
`synchronize_data` on the first one, because it cannot de-duplicate schema
definitions.

`synchronize_data` internally uses `COPY` to unload and load the data
from the provider.

If both `synchronize_structure` and `synchronize_data` are used, take care to
create table definitions, then copy data, and only create indexes etc. at the end.

**Note**: An alternative to `pglogical.create_subscription` is the
`pglogical_create_subscriber` tool, which takes a `pg_basebackup` or uses a
pre-existing streaming replica of the provider node and converts it into a new
logical replica. It's often much faster where network bandwidth is sufficient,
but cannot filter the initial dump to exclude some databases/tables/etc.

**Note**: `pglogical.create_subscription` will appear to hang (it will wait
indefinitely without returning) if the database pointed to by `provider_dsn` is
on the same PostgreSQL instance as the subscriber and `create_slot` is true.
This happens because the replication slot creation command on the provider
waits for all transactions that were in-progress at the time it started to
commit, but the transaction running `pglogical.create_subscription` cannot
commit until after the create replication slot command returns, so the two
deadlock. The PostgreSQL deadlock detector does not identify this condition as
it is not a deadlock on heavyweight locks, and is not visible in the `pg_locks`
view. To make this fairly uncommon use case work, manually create a logical
replication slot for the pglogical subscription on the provider using the
`'pglogical_output'` output plugin, e.g.

```sql
SELECT pg_catalog.create_logical_replication_slot(
pglogical.gen_slot_name(
'SUBSCRIBER_DBNAME',
'PROVIDER_NODE_NAME',
'SUBSCRIPTION_NAME'
), 'pglogical_output');
```

then specify `create_slot := false` to `pglogical.create_subscription()`. You may
alternately choose your own replication slot name instead of using
`gen_slot_name` then pass it as the `slot_name` parameter to
`create_subscription`.

#### Parameters

-   `subscription_name` - name of the subscription; must be unique
-   `provider_dsn` - connection string to a provider
-   `replication_sets` - array of replication sets to subscribe to, these must
    already exist, default is "{default,ddl_sql}"
-   `synchronize_structure` - specifies if to synchronize structure from
    provider to the subscriber; default false
-   `synchronize_data` - specifies if to synchronize data from provider to
    the subscriber; default true
-   `create_slot` - set to false to suppress automatic creation of a logical
    replication slot on the provider in order to use a pre-created one; default true
-   `slot_name` - override the autogenerated replication slot name pglogical
    generates in order to supply your own; default is same as that generated by
    `pglogical.pglogical_gen_slot_name()`
-   `forward_origins` - array of replication origin names to forward. Currently the only
    supported values are: an empty array meaning don't forward any changes
    that didn't originate on provider node (this is useful for two-way
    replication between the nodes); or "{all}" which means replicate all
    changes no matter what is their origin. The default is "{all}"
-   `apply_delay` - how much to delay replication; default is 0 seconds.
    Mainly used for application testing, but also useful for delayed
    standbys.
-   `forward_origins` - array of origin names to forward; currently only
    supported values are empty array meaning don't forward any changes
    that didn't originate on provider node (this is useful for two-way
    replication between the nodes), or "{all}" which means replicate all
    changes no matter what is their origin; default is "{all}"
-   `apply_delay` - how much to delay replication; default is 0 seconds
-   `strip_origins` - determines whether to remove origin names from
    forwarded data, making it look like the data originate from local node,
    and allowing to forward the data to a subscription in the same instance
    (default is "false" which keeps origin info). The negative effect is
    it makes it impossible to redirect the subscription to the first node.
-   `num_writers` - number of parallel writers for this subscription, -1
     means the subscription will use the default as specified by the GUC
     pglogical.writers_per_subscription. Valid values are either -1 or a
     positive integer.
-   `writer` - which writer to use for writing the data from the replication
    stream.  Only `HeapWriter` is supported in this version of PGLogical.
    `local` is an alias for backwards compatibility.
-   `writer_options` - writer-specific options as an array of keys and values

### `pglogical_create_subscriber`

`pglogical_create_subscriber` isn't a SQL function, it's a standalone command
that provides an alternative way to create a subscriber. By default it will
take a `pg_basebackup` of the provider node and convert that into a `pglogical`
subscriber.

This can be a lot faster than `pglogical.create_subscription` where network and
disk bandwidth is sufficient. However, it cannot filter out individual tables
or table subsets, and it copies all databases whether or not they are intended
for use with pglogical. It does not respect replication sets for the initial
data copy. Unlike `pglogical.create_subscription`, it copies indexes rather
than rebuilding them on the subscriber side.

It may be necessary to specify a customized `postgresql.conf` and/or `pg_hba.conf`
for the copied node. In particular, you *must* copy the provider's `postgresql.conf`
and edit it to change the `port` if you plan on creating a subscriber on the same
host, where the port number would otherwise conflict.

`pglogical_create_subscriber` may also be used to convert an existing, running
streaming replica of the provider into a subscriber. This lets the user clone
the provider using alternative methods like `pg_start_backup()`, `rsync`, and
`pg_stop_backup()`, or from a SAN snapshot. This conversion is done
automatically when the target data directory is non-empty and instead contains
a suitable PostgreSQL streaming replica.

pglogical.alter_subscription_interface (
    subscription_name name,
    interface_name name
)
```

#### Parameters

-   `subscription_name` - name of an existing subscription
-   `interface_name` - name of an existing interface of the current provider
    node

### pglogical.alter_subscription_synchronize

All unsynchronized tables in all sets are synchronized in a single operation.

#### Synopsis

```sql
pglogical.alter_subscription_synchronize (
    subscription_name name,
    truncate bool
)
```

Tables are copied and synchronized one by one. Command does not block, just
initiates the action.

Use `pglogical.wait_for_subscription_sync_complete('sub_name')` to wait for
the resynchronization to complete.

#### Parameters

-   `subscription_name` - name of the existing subscription
-   `truncate` - if true, tables will be truncated before copy; default false

### pglogical.alter_subscription_resynchronize_table

Asynchronously resynchronize one existing table.

**WARNING: This function will truncate the table first.** The table will be
visibly empty to transactions between when the resync is scheduled and
when it completes.

Use `pglogical.wait_for_subscription_sync_complete('sub_name')` to wait for all
pending resynchronizations to complete, or
`pglogical.wait_for_table_sync_complete` for just the named table.

#### Synopsis

```sql
pglogical.alter_subscription_resynchronize_table (
    subscription_name name,
    relation regclass
)
```

#### Parameters

-   `subscription_name` - name of the existing subscription
-   `relation` - name of existing table, optionally qualified

### pglogical.show_subscription_status

Shows status and basic information about a subscription.

```sql
pglogical.show_subscription_status (subscription_name name)
```

#### Parameters

-   `subscription_name` - optional name of the existing subscription, when no
    name was provided, the function will show status for all subscriptions on
    local node

### pglogical.show_subscription_table

Shows the synchronization status of a table.

#### Synopsis

```sql
pglogical.show_subscription_table (
    subscription_name name,
    relation regclass
)
```

#### Parameters

-   `subscription_name` - name of the existing subscription
-   `relation` - name of existing table, optionally qualified

### pglogical.show_subscription_clock_drift

Shows clock drift between provider and subscriber.

On the subscriber at apply time, we track the commit timestamp
received from the provider and the current local timestamp. When
the above function is invoked, we generate a diff (interval) of
these values. A negative value will indicate clock drift.

```sql
pglogical.show_subscription_clock_drift (subscription_name name)
```

#### Parameters

-   `subscription_name` - optional name of the existing subscription; when no
    name is provided, the function will show clock drift information for all
    subscriptions on the local node

### pglogical.alter_subscription_add_replication_set

Adds one replication set into a subscriber. Does not synchronize, only
activates consumption of events.

#### Synopsis

```sql
pglogical.alter_subscription_add_replication_set (
    subscription_name name,
    replication_set name
)
```

#### Parameters

-   `subscription_name` - name of the existing subscription
-   `replication_set` - name of replication set to add

### pglogical.alter_subscription_remove_replication_set

Removes one replication set from a subscriber.

#### Synopsis

```sql
 pglogical.alter_subscription_remove_replication_set (
    subscription_name name,
    replication_set name
)
```

#### Parameters

-   `subscription_name` - name of the existing subscription
-   `replication_set` - name of replication set to remove

### pglogical.wait_for_subscription_sync_complete

Wait on the subscriber side until the named subscription is fully synchronized.
The function waits for both the initial schema and data syncs (if any) and any
currently outstanding individual table resyncs.

To ensure that this function sees and waits for pending resynchronizations
triggered by provider-side replication set changes, make sure to
`pglogical.wait_slot_confirm_lsn(NULL, NULL)` on the provider after any
replication set changes.

#### Synopsis

```sql
  pglogical.wait_for_subscription_sync_complete(
    subscription_name name
  )
```

#### Parameters

-   `subscription_name` - name of the existing subscription to wait for

### pglogical.wait_for_table_sync_complete

Same as `pglogical.wait_for_subscription_sync_complete`, except that
it waits for the subscription to be synced and for exactly one named table,
which must exist on the downstream. You can use this variant to wait for
a specific table resync to complete while ignoring other pending resyncs.

#### Synopsis

```sql
  pglogical.wait_for_table_sync_complete(
    subscription_name name,
    relid regclass
  )
```

#### Parameters

-   `subscription_name` - name of the existing subscription to wait for
-   `relid` - possibly schema-qualified relation name (cast to regclass if needed)
              for the relation to wait for sync completion of.

### `pglogical.wait_slot_confirm_lsn(name, pg_lsn)`

On a pglogical provider, wait for the specified replication slot(s) to pass
all the requested WAL position.

Note that to wait for a subscriber this function should be called on the
*provider*, not the subscriber.

Waits for one specified slot if named explicitly, or all logical slots that use
the pglogical output plugin if the slot name is null.

If no position is supplied the current WAL write position on the Pg instance
this function is called on is used.

No timeout is offered, use a `statement_timeout`.

This function can only wait for physical slots and for logical slots with
output plugins other than 'pglogical' if specified as a single named slot
argument.

For physical slots the LSN waited for is the `restart_lsn`, because
physical slots don't have the same two-phase advance as logical slots
and they have a NULL `confirmed_flush_lsn`. Because physical standbys
guarantee durability (flush) before visibility (replay), if you want
to ensure transactions are actually visible you should call
`pglogical.standby_wait_replay_upstream_lsn` on the standby instead.

Waiting with default (null) position can cause delays on idle systems
because the slot position may not advance until the next standby status
update if there are no further txns to replay. If you can ensure there will
be are no concurrent transactions you can instead capture
`pg_current_wal_insert_lsn()` after the writes you are interested in but
before you commit the transaction, then wait for that. Ideally commit would
report the commit lsn, and you could wait for that, but Pg doesn't do that
yet. Doing this may lead to waits ending prematurely if there are concurrent
txns, so only do it on test harness setups that do only one thing at a time.

#### Synopsis

```sql
  SELECT pglogical.wait_slot_confirm_lsn(
    slotname name,
    target_lsn pg_lsn
  );
```

Typically it's sufficient to use:

```sql
SELECT pglogical.wait_slot_confirm_lsn(NULL, NULL);
```

to wait until all pglogical (and bdr3) subscriber replication slots'
`confirmed_flush_lsn`s have confirmed a successful flush to disk of all WAL
that was written on the provider as of the start of the
`pglogical.wait_slot_confirm_lsn` call.

#### Parameters

-   `slotname` - name of the replication slot to wait for, or NULL for all
                 pglogical slots
-   `target_lsn` - xlog position to wait for slots to confirm, or NULL for current
                   xlog insert location.

### `pglogical.standby_wait_replay_upstream_lsn(pg_lsn)`

On a physical streaming replica (hot standby), wait for the
standby to replay WAL from the upstream up to or past the
specified lsn before returning.

Does not support an explicit timeout. Use a `statement_timeout`.

ERRORs if called on a non-standby, or when a standby is promoted
while waiting.

Use this where you need to guarantee that changes are replayed and
visible on a replica, not just safe on disk. The sender-side function
`pglogical.wait_slot_confirm_lsn()` only ensures durability, not
visibility, when applied to physical replicas, because there's
no guarantee the flushed WAL is replayed and commits become visible
before the flush position is reported to the upstream.

This is effectively a convenience function for a loop over
`pg_last_wal_replay_lsn()` for use in testing.

### pglogical.alter_subscription_skip_changes_upto

Because logical replication can replicate across versions, doesn't replicate
global changes like roles, and can replicate selectively, sometimes the logical
replication apply process can encounter an error and stop applying changes.

Wherever possible such problems should be fixed by making changes to the
subscriber side.  `CREATE`ing any missing table that's blocking replication,
`CREATE` a needed role, `GRANT` a necessary permission, etc. But occasionally a
problem can't be fixed that way and it may be necessary to skip entirely over a
transaction.

There's no support in pglogical for skipping over only parts of a transaction,
i.e. subscriber-side filtering.  Changes are skipped as entire transactions,
all or nothing. To decide where to skip to, use log output to find the commit
LSN, per the example below, or peek the change stream with the logical decoding
functions.

Unless a transaction only made one change, it's often necessary to manually
apply the transaction's effects on the downstream side, so it's important to
save the problem transaction whenever possible. See the example below.

It's possible to skip over changes without
`pglogical.alter_subscription_skip_changes_upto` by using
`pg_catalog.pg_logical_slot_get_binary_changes` to skip to the LSN of interest,
so this is really a convenience function. It does do a faster skip; however, it
may bypass some kinds of errors in logical decoding.

This function only works on disabled subscriptions.

The usual sequence of steps is:

-   identify the problem subscription and LSN of the problem commit
-   disable the subscription
-   save a copy of the transaction(s) using `pg_catalog.pg_logical_slot_peek_changes` *on the provider* (if possible)
-   `pglogical.alter_subscription_skip_changes_upto` on the subscriber
-   apply repaired or equivalent changes on the subscriber manually if necessary
-   re-enable the subscription

**WARNING**: It's easy to make problems worse when using this function.  Don't
do anything unless you're really, really sure it's the only option.

#### Synopsis

```sql
  pglogical.alter_subscription_skip_changes_upto(
    subname text,
    skip_upto_and_including pg_lsn
  );
```

#### Example

Apply of a transaction is failing with an ERROR, and you've determined that
lower-impact fixes such as changes to the subscriber side will not resolve this
issue. You determine that you must skip the transaction.

In the error logs, find the commit record LSN to skip to, as     in this
artificial example:

```shell
  ERROR:  55000: pglogical target relation "public.break_me" does not exist
  CONTEXT:  during apply of INSERT in commit before 0/1B28848, xid 670 committed
                                   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                                    this LSN
  at 2018-07-03 14:28:48.58659+08 (action #2) from node replorigin 1
```

and if needed use the `pglogical.subscriptions` view to map the origin back to
a subscription name, e.g.:

```sql
SELECT subscription_name, slot_name
FROM pglogical.subscriptions s
WHERE replication_origin_id = 1
```

Next, disable the subscription so the apply worker doesn't try to connect to the replication slot:

```sql
SELECT pglogical.alter_subscription_disable('the_subscription');
```

Note that you cannot skip only parts of the transaction, it's all or nothing. So
it's strongly recommended that you save a record of it by `COPY`ing it out on the
provider side first, using the subscription's slot name (as obtained above).

```sql
  \copy (SELECT * FROM pg_catalog.pg_logical_slot_peek_changes('the_slot_name',
      'the_target_lsn', NULL, 'min_proto_version', '1', 'max_proto_version', '1',
      'startup_params_format', '1', 'proto_format', 'json')
   TO 'transaction_to_drop.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv);
```

*(Note that the example is broken into multiple lines for readability,
but it should be issued in a single line because `\copy` does not
support multi-line commands)*

Now you can skip the change by changing "peek" to "get" above, but
`pglogical.skip_changes_upto` does a faster skip that avoids decoding
and outputting all the data:

```sql
SELECT pglogical.alter_subscription_skip_changes_upto('subscription_name',
'the_target_lsn');
```

If necessary or desired, apply the same changes (or repaired versions of them)
manually to the subscriber, using the dumped transaction contents as a guide.

Finally, re-enable the subscription:

```sql
SELECT pglogical.alter_subscription_enable('the_subscription');
```

### pglogical.alter_subscription_writer_options

Change the writer options first addressed when `writer_name` and `writer_options`
are clarified with pglogical.create_subscription.

#### Synopsis

```sql
  pglogical.alter_subscription_writer_options(
  subscription_name name,
  writer_name name,
  writer_options text[] = '{}'

  );
```

#### Example

Find the subscription you want to alter and use that as the `subscription_name` and
possibly the `writer_name` if chosen (shown first). Then the DML with the `writer_options`
text array.

```sql
SELECT pglogical.alter_subscription_writer_options(sub_name, sub_name, '{}') FROM pglogical.subscription;
```

Grant all writer options to `writer_name` super; array has to be an even number of elements.

```sql
SELECT pglogical.alter_subscription_writer_options(sub_name, 'super', '{UPDATE,INSERT,DELETE,''}') FROM pglogical.subscription;
```

### pglogical.alter_subscription_set_conflict_resolver

Change the conflict resolver of given conflict type for the given subscription.

#### Synopsis

```sql
pglogical.alter_subscription_set_conflict_resolver(
	sub_name text,
	conflict_type text,
	conflict_resolver text
	)
```

#### Parameters

-   `sub_name` - name of subscription to change
-   `conflict_type` - type of conflict to configure (see bellow)
-   `conflict_resolver` - which resolver to use for the given conflict type (see bellow)

Conflict type can be one of:

-   `insert_exists` - the row being inserted exists locally
-   `update_missing` - the row being updated does not exist locally
-   `delete_missing` - the row being deleted does not exist locally
-   `update_origin_change` - the row being updated was updated on a different
    origin
-   `target_table_missing` - the table corresponding to the change does not
    exist locally
-   `target_column_missing` - the column being updated or inserted to does not
    exist locally
-   `source_column_missing` - a column that exists locally is not available in
    the updated or inserted row
    replicated
-   `delete_recently_updated` - the row being deleted was updated locally
    recently
-   `update_pkey_exists` - the updated primary key exists locally
-   `apply_error` - an error occured while applying the change locally
-   `apply_error_trigger` - an error occured while firing a trigger locally
    after applying the change
-   `apply_error_ddl` - an error occured during applying a DDL that was
    replicated
-   `apply_error_dml` - an error occured while applying a DML that was

    Note that `apply_error`, `apply_error_trigger`, `apply_error_ddl` and
    `apply_error_dml` are never raised right now. They may be used in future.

Conflict resolver can be one of:

-   `error` - the replication will stop on error if conflict is detected; manual
    action is then required for resolution.
-   `skip` - keep the local version of the data and ignore the
    conflicting change that is coming from the remote node. This is same as
    `keep_local` which is now deprecated.
-   `update` - always apply the upstream change that's conflicting with local data.
    This is same as `apply_remote`, which is now deprecated.
-   `update_if_newer` - the version of data with the newest commit timestamp
    will be kept (this can be either the local or the remote version). This is same
    as `last_update_wins` which is now deprecated.
-   `update_if_older` - the version of the data with the oldest timestamp will
    be kept (this can be either the local or the remote version). This is same
    as `first_update_wins` which is now deprecated.
-   `insert_or_skip` - if the row being updated is missing and the downstream
    can verify that the updated row was none of the ones that exist the new row
    will be inserted. Otherwise the change will be skipped.
-   `insert_or_error` - if the row being updated is missing and the downstream
    can verify that the updated row was none of the ones that exist the new row
    will be inserted. Otherwise the replication will stop on error.
-   `ignore` - if the updated or inserted column is missing, it will be ignored
    while applying the upstream change
-   `ignore_or_error` - if the updated or inserted column is missing, it will be ignored
    if it the new value is NULL. Otherwise replication will stop on error
-   `use_default_value` - if a column is present locally but is not available on
    the source, a default value will be used for that column.

The available settings and defaults depend on the version of PostgreSQL and
other settings.

The `skip`, `update_if_newer` and `first_update_wins` settings require the
`track_commit_timestamp` PostgreSQL setting to be enabled.  Those can not be
used with PostgreSQL 9.4 as `track_commit_timestamp` is not available in there.

Some conflict resolvers can not be used with some conflict types e.g. resolver
`update_if_newer` can not be used with conflict type `target_table_missing`.
`error` is the only resolved available to handle conflict types `apply_error`,
`apply_error_trigger`, `apply_error_ddl`, or `apply_error_dml`. The function
throws an error when an incompatible resolver is used.

#### Example

Find the subscription you want to change the conflict resolver for and use that as the `sub_name`.

```sql
SELECT pglogical.alter_subscription_set_conflict_resolver(`sub_name`, 'insert_exists', 'update_if_newer')
```

Changes the conflict resolver of conflict type `insert_exists` for subscription
`sub_name` to `update_if_newer`.  If the row specified by INSERT change on
subscription `sub_name` already exists locally, out of the two rows, the one
with the newest commit will be kept.
