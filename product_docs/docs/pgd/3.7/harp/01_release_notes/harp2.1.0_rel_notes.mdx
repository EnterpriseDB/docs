title: "Version 2.1.0"
---

This is a minor release of HARP 2 that includes new features as well
as fixes for issues identified in previous versions.

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Feature | The BDR DCS now uses a push notification from the consensus rather than through polling nodes. <p>This change reduces the time for new leader selection and the load that HARP does on the BDR DCS since it doesn't need to poll in short intervals anymore.</p> |
| Feature | TPA now restarts each HARP Proxy one by one and wait until they come back to reduce any downtime incurred by the application during software upgrades. |
| Feature | The support for embedding PGBouncer directly into HARP Proxy is now deprecated and will be removed in the next major release of HARP. <p>It's now possible to configure TPA to put PGBouncer on the same node as HARP Proxy and point to that HARP Proxy. </p> |
| Bug Fix | `harpctl promote <node_name>` would occasionally promote a different node than the one specified.  This has been fixed. (RT75406) |
| Bug Fix | Fencing would sometimes fail when using BDR as the Distributed Consensus Service.  This has been corrected. |
| Bug Fix | `harpctl apply` no longer turns off routing for leader after the cluster has been established. (RT80790) |
| Bug Fix | Harp-manager no longer exits if it cannot start a failed database. Harp-manager will keep retrying with randomly increasing periods. (RT78516) |
| Bug Fix | The internal pgbouncer proxy implementation had a memory leak.  This has been remediated. |
