navTitle: Consensus layer
title: Consensus layer considerations

HARP is designed so that it can work with different implementations of 
consensus layer, also known as Distributed Control Systems (DCS).

Currently the following DCS implementations are supported:

 - etcd
 - BDR

This information is specific to HARP's interaction with the 
supported DCS implementations.

## BDR driver compatibility

The `bdr` native consensus layer is available from BDR versions 
[3.6.21](/bdr/3.7/release-notes/#bdr-362) 
and [3.7.3](/bdr/3.7/release-notes/#bdr-373).

For the purpose of maintaining a voting quorum, BDR Logical Standby 
nodes don't participate in consensus communications in a BDR cluster. Don't count these in the total node list to fulfill DCS quorum requirements.

## Maintaining quorum

Clusters of any architecture require at least n/2 + 1 nodes to maintain 
consensus via a voting quorum. Thus a three-node cluster can tolerate the outage of 
a single node, a five-node cluster can tolerate a two-node outage, and so on. If 
consensus is ever lost, HARP becomes inoperable because the DCS prevents it 
from deterministically identifying the node that is the lead master in a 
particular location.

As a result, whichever DCS is chosen, more than half of the nodes must always 
be available _cluster-wide_. This can become a non-trivial element when 
distributing DCS nodes among two or more data centers. A network partition 
prevents quorum in any location that can't maintain a voting majority, and thus 
HARP stops working.

Thus an odd-number of nodes (with a minimum of three) is crucial when building the 
consensus layer. An ideal case distributes nodes across a minimum of 
three independent locations to prevent a single network partition from 
disrupting consensus.

One example configuration is to designate two DCS nodes in two data centers 
coinciding with the primary BDR nodes, and a fifth DCS node (such as a BDR 
witness) elsewhere. Using such a design, a network partition between the two 
BDR data centers doesn't disrupt consensus thanks to the independently
located node.

### Multi-consensus variant

HARP assumes one lead master per configured location. Normally each 
location is specified in HARP using the `location` configuration setting. 
By creating a separate DCS cluster per location, you can emulate
this behavior independently of HARP.

To accomplish this, configure HARP in `config.yml` to use a different
DCS connection target per desired Location.

HARP nodes in DC-A use something like this:

```yaml
location: dca
dcs:
  driver: etcd
  endpoints:
    - dcs-a1:2379
    - dcs-a2:2379
    - dcs-a3:2379
```

While DC-B uses different hostnames corresponding to nodes in its 
canonical location:

```yaml
location: dcb
dcs:
  driver: etcd
  endpoints:
    - dcs-a1:2379
    - dcs-a2:2379
    - dcs-a3:2379
```

There's no DCS communication between different data centers in this design, 
and thus a network partition between them doesn't affect HARP operation. A 
consequence of this is that HARP is completely unaware of nodes in the other 
location, and each location operates essentially as a separate HARP cluster.

This isn't possible when using BDR as the DCS, as BDR maintains a consensus 
layer across all participant nodes. 

A possible drawback to this approach is that `harpctl` can't interact 
with nodes outside of the current location. It's impossible to obtain 
node information, get or set the lead master, or perform any other operation that 
targets the other location. Essentially this organization renders the 
`--location` parameter to `harpctl` unusable.

### TPAexec and consensus

These considerations are integrated into TPAexec as well. When deploying a
cluster using etcd, it constructs a separate DCS cluster per
location to facilitate high availability in favor of strict consistency.

Thus this configuration example groups any DCS nodes assigned to the `first` location together, and the 
`second` location is a separate cluster:

```yaml
cluster_vars:
  failover_manager: harp
  harp_consensus_protocol: etcd

locations:
  - Name: first
  - Name: second
```

To override this behavior, 
configure the `harp_location` implicitly to force a particular grouping.

Thus this example returns all etcd nodes into a single cohesive DCS layer:

```yaml
cluster_vars:
  failover_manager: harp
  harp_consensus_protocol: etcd

locations:
  - Name: first
  - Name: second
  - Name: all_dcs

instance_defaults:
  vars:
    harp_location: all_dcs
```

The `harp_location` override might also be necessary to favor specific node 
groupings when using cloud providers such as Amazon that favor availability
zones in regions over traditional data centers.
