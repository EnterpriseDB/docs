title: "EDB Postgres Distributed"
---

EDB Postgres Distributed provides loosely-coupled multi-master logical replication
using a mesh topology. This means that you can write to any server and the
changes are sent directly, row-by-row to all the
other servers that are part of the same mesh.

EDB Postgres Distributed consists of several components that make the whole
cluster work.

## Postgres server

Three different Postgres distributions can be used:

- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - open source
- [EDB Postgres Extended Server](https://techsupport.enterprisedb.com/customer_portal/sw/2ndqpostgres/) - PostgreSQL compatible and optimized for replication
- [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest) - Oracle compatible, optimized for replication, and additional enterprise features

What Postgres distribution and version is right for you depends on the features you need.
See the feature matrix in [Choosing a Postgres distribution](/pgd/latest/choosing_server) for detailed comparison.


## BDR

A Postgres server with the [BDR](bdr) extension installed is referred to as a BDR
node. BDR nodes can be either data nodes or witness nodes.

Witness nodes don't participate in data replication and are only used as a
tie-breaker for consensus.


## HARP

[HARP](harp) is connection management tool for a EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

It leverages consensus-driven quorum to determine the correct connection end-point
in a semi-exclusive manner to prevent unintended multi-node writes from an
application. This reduces the potential for data conflicts.

## pglogical 3.7

BDR depends on [pglogical 3.7](pglogical 3.7) to provide the replication
channel upon which BDR builds.
