## Upgrading to EDB Postgres Distributed 6.1

You can upgrade to EDB Postgres Distributed 6.1 from EDB Postgres Distributed 5.x or earlier.

!!!Warning

  Replication of materialized views may be broken when upgrading to PGD 6.1.0 in the following scenario:

  - A cluster contains a materialized view before upgrade.
  - Replication for the cluster wasn't working.
  - The materialized view wasn't created everywhere because replication wasn't working.
  - After the upgrade to PGD 6.1.0, a user try to create a view or index on the materialized view, but the create fails.

  To prevent this issue, you can do one of the following:

  - Before upgrading to PGD 6.1.0., manually create the materialized view on each node.
  - After upgrading to PGD 6.1.0., drop and create the materialized view so that it gets replicated.
