Connection Manager's authentication is configured through Postgres's own [`pg_hba.conf`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/auth-pg-hba-conf.html) file. Connection Manager uses the same authentication methods as Postgres.

## Connection Manager connection types

Connection Manager supports the following connection types in pg_hba.conf:

- `host` - TCP/IP connections
- `hostssl` - TCP/IP connections with SSL
- `hostnossl` - TCP/IP connections without SSL

## Connection Manager authentication methods

Connection Manager supports the following authentication methods in pg_hba.conf:

- `trust` - No authentication
- `reject` - Reject the connection
- `md5` - MD5 password authentication
- `scram-sha-256` - SCRAM-SHA-256 password authentication
- `cert` - SSL certificate authentication
- `pam` - Pluggable Authentication Module (PAM) authentication

## Connection Manager authentication options

Connection Manager also supports regular expression matching for the `user` and `database` fields in pg_hba.conf. This allows you to specify a pattern for matching user and database names, making it easier to manage authentication for multiple users and databases.

Group membership checks are also supported. This allows you to specify a group of users that can connect to the database, rather than specifying each user individually.

## Unsupported pg_hba.conf rules

Where a rule is not supported by Connection Manager, it will be logged as a warning and ignored.
