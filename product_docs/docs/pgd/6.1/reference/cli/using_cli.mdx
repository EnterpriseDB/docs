## What is the PGD CLI?

The PGD CLI is a convenient way to connect to and manage your PGD cluster. To use it, you need a user with PGD superuser privileges or equivalent. The PGD user with superuser privileges is the [bdr_superuser role](../security). An example of an equivalent user is edb_admin on an EDB Cloud Service distributed high-availability cluster.

!!! Important Setting passwords
PGD CLI doesn't interactively prompt for your password. You must pass your password using one of the following methods:

- Adding an entry to your [`.pgpass` password file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html), which includes the host, port, database name, user name, and password.
- Setting the password in the `PGPASSWORD` environment variable.
- Including the password in the connection string.

We recommend the first option, as the other options don't scale well with multiple databases, or they compromise password confidentiality.
!!!

## Running the PGD CLI

Once you have [installed pgd-cli](installing), run the `pgd` command to access the PGD command line interface. The `pgd` command needs details about the host, port, and database to connect to, along with your username and password.

## Passing a database connection string

Use the `--dsn` flag to pass a database connection string to the `pgd` command. When you pass the connection string with the `--dsn` flag, you don't need a configuration file. The flag takes precedence even if a configuration file is present. For example:

```sh
pgd nodes list --dsn "host=bdr-a1 port=5432 dbname=pgddb user=enterprisedb"
```

The database conmnection string (DSN) can also be set using the `PGD_CLI_DSN` environment variable. For example:

```sh
export PGD_CLI_DSN="host=bdr-a1 port=5432 dbname=pgddb user=enterprisedb"
pgd nodes list
```

The `--dsn` flag takes precedence over the environment variable, so if both are set, the `--dsn` value is used.

See [PGD CLI Command reference](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/command_ref/) for a description of the command options.

## Specifying a configuration file

If a `pgd-cli-config.yml` file is in `/etc/edb/pgd-cli` or `$HOME/.edb/pgd-cli`, `pgd` uses it. You can override
this behavior using the optional `-f` or `--config-file` flag. For example:

```sh
pgd nodes list -f /opt/my-config.yml
__OUTPUT__
Node Name Group Name   Node Kind Join State Node Status
--------- ------------ --------- ---------- -----------
kaftan    dc1_subgroup data      ACTIVE     Up         
kaolin    dc1_subgroup data      ACTIVE     Up         
kaboom    dc1_subgroup data      ACTIVE     Up  
```


## Specifying the output format

Use the `-o` or `--output` flag to change the default output format to JSON. For example:

```sh
pgd nodes list -o json
[
  {
    "node_name": "kaftan",
    "node_group_name": "dc1_subgroup",
    "node_kind_name": "data",
    "join_state": "ACTIVE",
    "node_status": "Up",
    "node_id": 3490219809,
    "node_seq_id": 2,
    "node_local_dbname": "pgddb"
  },
  {
    "node_name": "kaolin",
    "node_group_name": "dc1_subgroup",
    "node_kind_name": "data",
    "join_state": "ACTIVE",
    "node_status": "Up",
    "node_id": 2111777360,
    "node_seq_id": 1,
    "node_local_dbname": "pgddb"
  },
  {
    "node_name": "kaboom",
    "node_group_name": "dc1_subgroup",
    "node_kind_name": "data",
    "join_state": "ACTIVE",
    "node_status": "Up",
    "node_id": 2710197610,
    "node_seq_id": 3,
    "node_local_dbname": "pgddb"
  }
]
```

The PGD CLI supports the following output formats.

| Setting    | Format   | Description                                                                                                                                                                 |
|------------|----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `simple`   | Tabular  | A simple tabular view. (Default).                                                                                                                                           |
| `json`     | JSON     | Presents the raw data with no formatting. For some commands, the JSON output might show more data than the tabular output, such as extra fields and more detailed messages. |
| `psql`     | PSQL     | A tabular view in the style of PSQL output. format.                                                                                                                         |
| `modern`   | Tabular  | A tabular view which uses box characters to deliniate the table.                                                                                                            |
| `markdown` | Markdown | A Markdown style output which may product long-form, non-tabular output for some commands such as `pgd assess`.                                                             |

## Accessing the command line help

To list the supported commands, enter:

```sh
pgd --help
```

For help with a specific command and its parameters, enter `pgd <command_name> --help`. For example:

```sh
pgd nodes list --help
```

!!! Note Avoiding stale data
The PGD CLI can return stale data on the state of the cluster if it's still connecting to nodes previously parted from the cluster. Edit the `pgd-cli-config.yml` file, or change your `--dsn` settings to ensure you are connecting to active nodes in the cluster.
