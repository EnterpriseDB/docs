## Synopsis

The `pgd node set-config` command is used to set node-level Postgres setting (GUC) in the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster. The command requires node `DSN` for `superuser` i.e. Postgres process owner user.

The command reloads the configuration on the node after setting the config and displays a warning of the GUC requires a server restart.

## Syntax
```plaintext
pgd node <NODE_NAME> set-config [OPTIONS] <CONFIG> <VALUE>
```

Where `<NODE_NAME>` is the name of the node for which you want to get options.

And `<CONFIG>` is the name of a specific node config you want to get and `<VALUE>` is the value you want it set to.

## Options

No command specific options. See [Global Options](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/command_ref/#global-options).

## Examples

### Set a specific node config

```shell
pgd node pgd-a1 set-config bdr.batch_inserts 20 --dsn "host=pgd-a1 port=5432 user=postgres "
__OUTPUT__
Command executed successfully
```

### Set a specific node config with a space in the value

```shell
pgd node pgd-a2 set-config unix_socket_directories "/var/run/edb-pge, /tmp, /var/lib/postgresql" --dsn "host=pgd-a2 port=5432 user=postgres "
__OUTPUT__
WARN: Config change requires a Postgres restart to take effect.
Command executed successfully
```

 Please note the `WARN` message indicates that the configuration change will not take effect until the Postgres server is restarted.
