## Synopsis

The `pgd node part` parts a PGD node from an active cluster. The part operation may take some time so the command waits for the operation to complete by default. However, if the `--no-wait` option is set, the command schedules the part operation and return with an advise.

## Syntax
```plaintext
pgd node <NODE_NAME> part [OPTIONS]
```

Where `<NODE_NAME>` is the name of the node to be parted.

## Options

The following options are available for the `pgd node part` command:

| Long       | Description                                    |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| --no-wait | Do not wait for the part operation to complete. |

See [Global Options](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/command_ref/#global-options).
