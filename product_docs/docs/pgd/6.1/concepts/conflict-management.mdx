title: Conflict Management
---

With PGD Expanded, the presence of multiple writers leads to the possibility, or even the likelihood, of conflicts. Changes to the same rows from different nodes can arrive on a node at any time. 
PGD Expanded provides a conflict management system that allows you to define how conflicts are handled in your distributed database environment.

Read more about conflict management in the [Conflict Management reference](/pgd/latest/reference/conflict-management/) documentation.
