PGD 6 Expanded supports a wide range of architectures, including the Essential editions standard and near-far architectures.

With Expanded, you can deploy an Essential architecture and then add more groups to it or build out a more complex architecture as your needs grow. The Essential architectures are designed to be simple to deploy and manage, while still providing the core features of PGD.

You can read about the Essential architectures in the [Essential How-to](/pgd/latest/essential-how-to/architectures/).
