With PGD 6 Expanded, you can deploy a cluster in a wide range of architectures. Unlike PGD 6 Essential, which is limited to two architectures made with a limited number of groups, PGD 6 Expanded supports multiple architectures with technically unlimited groups, including:

* [**Always-on architecture**](always-on): A single PGD cluster with two or more groups in the same data center or availability zone. This architecture is designed for high availability and disaster recovery, ensuring that the database remains operational even if one group fails.
* [**Essentials's Standard/One-location architecture**](essential): A single PGD cluster with three nodes in the same data center or availability zone; The PGD 6 Essential architecture.
* [**Multi-location architecture**](multi-location): A single PGD cluster with two or more groups in different data centers or availability zones.
* [**Geo-distributed architecture**](geo-distributed): A single PGD cluster with two or more groups in different regions, like a multi-location architecture but with higher latency and potential network partitioning issues.
