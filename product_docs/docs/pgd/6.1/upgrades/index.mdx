While PGD and Postgres are closely related, they're separate products with separate upgrade paths. This section covers how to upgrade both PGD and Postgres.

## Upgrading PGD

EDB Postgres Distributed is a flexible platform. This means that your upgrade path depends largely on how you installed PGD.

-   **[Upgrading manually](manual_overview)** — If you manually installed and configured your PGD cluster, you can move a cluster between versions, both minor and major.

-   **[Upgrade paths](upgrade_paths)** — Several supported upgrade paths are available.

-   **[Compatibility changes](compatibility)** — If you're upgrading from PGD 3.x or 4.x to PGD 5.x or later, you need to understand the compatibility changes between versions.

## Upgrading Postgres or Postgres and PGD major versions

-   **[In-place Postgres major version upgrades](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/command_ref/node/upgrade/)** — How to use `pgd node upgrade` to manually upgrade the Postgres version or Postgres and PGD major version on one or more nodes.
