## Upgrading Postgres major versions

Upgrading a Postgres database's major version to access improved features, performance enhancements, and security updates is a common administration task. 
Doing the same for an EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) cluster is essentially the same process but performed as a rolling upgrade.

The rolling upgrade process allows updating individual cluster nodes to a new major Postgres version while maintaining cluster availability and operational continuity. 
This approach minimizes downtime and ensures data integrity by allowing the rest of the cluster to remain operational as each node is upgraded sequentially. 

The following overview of the general instructions and [worked example](#worked-example) help to provide a smooth and controlled upgrade process.

!!!Note
The following overview and worked example assume you're upgrading to or from 5.9.0+. 
For upgrading to older versions of PGD, you need to use the command `bdr_pg_upgrade`, which has almost the same behavior and requirements as `pgd node upgrade`.
The only difference is that with `bdr_pg_upgrade` you can only upgrade major versions of Postgres (community/PGE/EDB Postgres Advanced Server), but with `pgd node upgrade` you can upgrade major versions of PGD and Postgres at once.
!!!

### Prepare the upgrade

To prepare for the upgrade, identify the subgroups and nodes you're trying to upgrade and note an initial upgrade order.

To do this, connect to one of the nodes using SSH and run the `pgd nodes list` command:

```bash
sudo -u postgres pgd nodes list
```

The `pgd nodes list` command shows you all the nodes in your PGD cluster and the subgroup to which each node belongs. 
Then you want to find out which node is the write leader in each subgroup:

```bash
sudo -u postgres pgd group <group_name> show --summary
```

This command shows you information about the pgd group tokened by your `<group_name>` running in your cluster, including which node is the write leader. 
To maintain operational continuity, you need to switch write leaders over to another node in their subgroup before you can upgrade them. 
To keep the number of planned switchovers to a minimum, when upgrading a subgroup of nodes, upgrade the writer leaders last. 

Even though you verified which node is the current write leader for planning purposes, the write leader of a subgroup could change to another node at any moment for operational reasons before you upgrade that node. 
Therefore, you still need to verify that a node isn't the write leader just before upgrading that node.

You now have enough information to determine your upgrade order, one subgroup at a time, aiming to upgrade the identified write leader node last in each subgroup. 

### Perform the upgrade on each node

!!! Note
To help prevent data loss, before starting the upgrade process, ensure that your databases and configuration files are backed up.
!!!

Using the [preliminary order](#prepare-the-upgrade), perform the following steps on each node while connected via SSH:

* **Confirm the current Postgres version**
  * View versions from PGD:

    `sudo -u postgres pgd nodes list --versions`.
  * Ensure that the expected major version is running.


* **Verify that the target node isn't the write leader**
  * Check whether the target node is the write leader for the group you're upgrading:

    `sudo -u postgres pgd group <group_name> show --summary`
  * If the target node is the current write leader for the group/subgroup you're upgrading, perform a [planned switchover](#perform-a-planned-switchover) to another node:

    `sudo -u postgres pgd group <group_name> set-leader <new_leader_node_name>` 


* **Stop Postgres on the target node**
  * Stop the Postgres service on the current node:

    `sudo systemctl stop postgres`

    The target node is no longer actively participating as a node in the cluster.


* **Install PGD and utilities**
  * Install PGD and its utilities compatible with the Postgres version you're upgrading to:

    `sudo apt install edb-bdr5-pg<new_postgres_version_number> edb-bdr-utilities`

* **Initialize the new Postgres instance**
  * Create a directory to house the database files for the new version of PostgreSQL:

    `sudo mkdir -p /opt/postgres/datanew`
  * Ensure that the user postgres has ownership permissions to the directory using `chown`.
  * Initialize a new PostgreSQL database cluster in the directory you just created. This step involves using the `initdb` command provided by the newly installed version of PostgreSQL. 
  Include the `--data-checksums` flag to ensure the cluster uses data checksums.

    `sudo -u postgres <path_to_postgres_bin>/initdb -D /opt/postgres/datanew --data-checksums`

    Replace `<path_to_postgres_bin>` with the path to the bin directory of the newly installed PostgreSQL version.

    You may need to run this command as the postgres user or another user with appropriate permissions.

* **Migrate configuration to the new Postgres version**
  * Locate the following configuration files in your current PostgreSQL data directory:
    * `postgresql.conf` &mdash; The main configuration file containing settings related to the database system.
    * `postgresql.auto.conf`&mdash; Contains settings set by PostgreSQL, such as those modified by the `ALTER SYSTEM` command.
    * `pg_hba.conf` &mdash; Manages client authentication, specifying which users can connect to which databases from which hosts.
    * The entire `conf.d` directory (if present) &mdash; Allows for organizing configuration settings into separate files for better manageability.
  * Copy these files and the `conf.d` directory to the new data directory you created for the upgraded version of PostgreSQL.


* **Verify the Postgres service is inactive**
  * Before proceeding, it's important to ensure that no PostgreSQL processes are active for both the old and the new data directories. This verification step prevents any data corruption or conflicts during the upgrade process.

    Use the `sudo systemctl status postgres` command to verify that Postgres was stopped. If it isn't stopped, run `systemctl stop postgres` and verify again that it was stopped.


* **Swap PGDATA directories for version upgrade**
  * Rename `/opt/postgres/data` to `/opt/postgres/dataold` and `/opt/postgres/datanew` to `/opt/postgres/data`.

  This step readies your system for the next crucial phase: running pgd node upgrade to finalize the PostgreSQL version transition.


* **Verify upgrade feasibility**
  * The `pgd node upgrade` tool offers a `--check` option designed to perform a preliminary scan of your current setup, identifying any potential issues that could hinder the upgrade process.

    You need to run this check from an upgrade directory with ownership given to user postgres, such as `/home/upgrade/`, so that the upgrade log files created by `pgd node upgrade` can be stored. 
    To initiate the safety check, append the `--check` option to your `pgd node upgrade` command.

    This operation simulates the upgrade process without making any changes, providing insights into any compatibility issues, deprecated features, or configuration adjustments required for a successful upgrade. 
  * Address any warnings or errors indicated by this check to ensure an uneventful transition to the new version.


* **Execute the Postgres major version upgrade**
  * Execute the upgrade process by running the `pgd node <node_name> upgrade` command without the `--check` option.
  * It's essential to monitor the command output for any errors or warnings that require attention. 
  * The time the upgrade process take depends on the size of your database and the complexity of your setup.


* **Update the Postgres service configuration**
  * Update the service configuration to reflect the new PostgreSQL version by updating the version number in the `postgres.service` file:

    `sudo sed -i -e 's/<old_version_number>/<new_version_number>/g' /etc/systemd/system/postgres.service`
  * Refresh the system's service manager to apply these changes:

    `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`


* **Restart Postgres**
  * Proceed to restart the PostgreSQL service:

    `systemctl start postgres`


* **Validate the new Postgres version**
  * Verify that your PostgreSQL instance is now upgraded:

    `sudo -u postgres pgd nodes list --versions`


* **Clean up post-upgrade**
  * Run `vacuumdb` with the `ANALYZE` option immediately after the upgrade but before introducing a heavy production load. Running this command minimizes the immediate performance impact, preparing the database for more accurate testing.
  * Remove the old version's data directory, `/opt/postgres/dataold`.
 
## Worked example: Upgrade PGD 4 to PGD 6.1

This worked example describes an in-place major version rolling upgrade from PGD 4 to PGD 6.1.

### Check harp-proxy leader

Start the upgrade on a node that isn't the harp-proxy leader. Check the harp-proxy leader:

```bash
test-pgd6major-d1:~ $ harpctl get leader a
```
```
Cluster  Name                     Location Ready Fenced Allow Routing Routing Status Role    Type Lock Duration 
-------  ----                     -------- ----- ------ ------------- -------------- ----    ---- ------------- 
bdrgroup test-pgd6major-d2 a        true  false  true                         primary bdr  6 
```
### Fence the node

Fence off  the node to be upgraded from HARP and then verify it was fenced, so it does not become the leader during the middle of upgrade:
```bash
test-pgd6major-d1:~ $ harpctl fence test-pgd6major-d1
```
```
2025-08-19T07:20:20.204Z	INFO	cmd/fence.go:42	fence node test-pgd6major-d1
```
```bash
test-pgd6major-d1:~ $ harpctl get nodes
Cluster  Name                     Location Ready Fenced Allow Routing Routing Status Role    Type Lock Duration 
-------  ----                     -------- ----- ------ ------------- -------------- ----    ---- ------------- 
bdrgroup test-pgd6major-d1 a        false true   true          N/A            primary bdr  6             
bdrgroup test-pgd6major-d2 a        true  false  true          ok             primary bdr  6
```

### Stop the Postgres service

On the fenced node, stop the Postgres service.

### Stop HARP manager

On the fenced node, stop HARP manager.

### Remove and install packages

On the fenced node, remove PGD 4.4 and the cli packages and install the PGD 6.1 packages.

### Enable Connection Manager

On the fenced node, enable Connection Manager by adding the guc `bdr.enable_builtin_connection_manager = true`  in postgresql.conf file. 

### Start the Postgres service

On the fenced node, start Postgres service. This performs an in-place upgrade of the PGD local node to PGD 6.1 with Connection Manager enabled.

### Start the Postgres service

On the fenced node, start the Postgres service.

### Start HARP manager

On the fenced node, start HARP manager.

### Unfence the node
Unfence the upgraded node from HARP:
```bash
test-pgd6major-d1:~ $ harpctl unfence test-pgd6major-d1
```
### Repeat steps for all nodes
Repeat same steps on all other nodes. 

### Confirm cluster version
Confirm the updated cluster version is version 6001 by `running bdr.group_raft_details`.

### Confirm SCRAM hashes

From any of the upgrades nodes, run the following query to ensure that SCRAM hashes are the same across all nodes for each user. This is required before applications switch to Connection Manager.

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
    rec RECORD;
    command TEXT;
BEGIN
    FOR rec IN SELECT rolname,rolpassword FROM pg_authid WHERE rolcanlogin = true AND rolpassword like 'SCRAM-SHA%'
    LOOP
        command := 'ALTER ROLE ' || quote_ident(rec.rolname) || ' WITH ENCRYPTED PASSWORD ' || ''' || rec.rolpassword || ''';
        EXECUTE command;
    END LOOP;
END;
```

This completes the worked example for an in-place major version rolling upgrade from PGD 4 to PGD 6.1.




## Worked example: Upgrade PGD 5 to PGD 6.1

This worked example describes an in-place major version rolling upgrade (PGD & Postgres) of a 3-node PGD 5, EPAS 13 cluster to PGD 6, EPAS 17 cluster using the `pgd node upgrade` command.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have a 3-node PGD 5, EPAS 13 cluster up and running. This is a TPA-deployed cluster.

```bash
pgd-a1:/home/rocky $ pgd nodes list
```
```
Node Name  Group Name Node Kind Join State Node Status
---------- ---------- --------- ---------- -----------
pgd-a1     group-a    data      ACTIVE     Up         
pgd-a2     group-a    data      ACTIVE     Up         
witness-a1 group-a    witness   ACTIVE     Up         
```


### Install packages for the new server and PGD

Ensure that the packages for EPAS 17 and the corresponding PGD 6 packages are installed on all nodes in the cluster.
To prevent binary conflicts, you must remove the PGD 5 packages, viz., edb-pgd5-cli and edb-bdr5-epas13, before installing the PGD 6 packages. The commands below were used for the RHEL 8 platform. Use the appropriate commands for your specific platform.

```bash
dnf remove edb-pgd5-cli edb-bdr5-epas13 -y
dnf install edb-as17-server edb-pgd6-essential-epas17 -y
```

## Pre-upgrade steps

### Version Check
Check the current version of the cluster (optional).

```bash
pgd-a1:/home/rocky $ pgd nodes list --versions
```
```
Node Name  BDR Version  Postgres Version
---------- ------------ ----------------
pgd-a1     5.9.0        13.22.28        
pgd-a2     5.9.0        13.22.28        
witness-a1 5.9.0        13.22.28        
```

### Move to Connection Manager

PGD 5 uses PGD Proxy for routing.  In PGD 6, PGD Proxy has been replaced with Connection Manager. When you upgrade from PGD 5 to PGD 6, use the following steps to move to Connection Manager.
See [PGD 5 - Moving from PGD Proxy to Connection Manager](./manual_overview#pgd-5---moving-from-pgd-proxy-to-connection-manager).

### Write leader node verification
Ensure that the node you want to upgrade is not the write leader node.

```bash
pgd-a1:/home/rocky $ pgd group group-a show --summary
```
```
Group Property    Value  
----------------- -------
Group Name        group-a
Parent Group Name dc-1   
Group Type        data   
Write Leader      pgd-a2 
Commit Scope             
```

The current write leader is node pgd-a2, so we are good to upgrade node pgd-a1.

Switch the write leader to a different node if it is the node to be upgraded.

Use the `pgd group set-leader` command to switch the write leader if required:
```bash
witness-a1:/home/rocky $ /usr/edb/as17/bin/pgd group group-a set-leader pgd-a1
```
```
Command executed successfully
```

```bash
witness-a1:/home/rocky $ /usr/edb/as17/bin/pgd group group-a show --summary
```
```
 Group Property    | Value   
-------------------+---------
 Group Name        | group-a 
 Parent Group Name | dc-1    
 Group Type        | data    
 Write Leader      | pgd-a1  
 Commit Scope      |         
```


### Fence the node

Fence a node in this cluster with `pgd node <node-name> set-option route_fence true` so that it does not become the write leader.

### Initialize the new Postgres instance

Execute the initdb utility to initialize the new server. Ensure the `--data-checksums` option is set.
```bash
/usr/edb/as17/bin/initdb -D /var/lib/edb/as17/data -E UTF8 --data-checksums
```

Create the new data dir if you don't want to use the default one. This example uses the default for simplicity.

### Migrate configuration to the new Postgres version

Copy the following files and directory (if present), to the new data directory you created for the upgraded version of PostgreSQL:

- `postgresql.conf`
- `postgresql.auto.conf`
- `pg_hba.conf`
- the `conf.d` directory

```bash
cp /opt/postgres/data/postgresql.conf /var/lib/edb/as17/data/
cp /opt/postgres/data/postgresql.auto.conf /var/lib/edb/as17/data/
cp /opt/postgres/data/pg_hba.conf /var/lib/edb/as17/data/
```

If you have a TPA-deployed cluster, copy the `conf.d` directory as well:

```bash
cp -r /opt/postgres/data/conf.d /var/lib/edb/as17/data/
```

!!! Warning Unsupported configurations in PGD 6

Some configurations may not be supported in PGD 6. In such cases, you will need to find an equivalent setting or determine if the configuration can be safely ignored. 

For instance, you may encounter the `operator_precedence_warning` GUC, which can be ignored in the new configuration.
!!!

Ensure both the old and new servers are shut down:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop postgres
sudo systemctl status postgres
```

!!!Note

systemctl commands were used in this example because the PostgreSQL instance is configured as a service. You might need to use the `pg_ctl` utility if your setup is different.
!!!

### Dry run check

Before running the actual upgrade, perform a dry run to check the compatibility and upgrade feasibility. The `pgd node upgrade` tool has a `--check` option, which performs a dry run of some of the upgrade process. You can use this option to ensure the upgrade goes smoothly. Run the upgrade command with the `--check` option.

```bash
/usr/edb/as17/bin/pgd node pgd-a1 upgrade \
--database bdrdb -B /usr/edb/as17/bin \
--socketdir /tmp \
--old-bindir /usr/edb/as13/bin \
--old-datadir /opt/postgres/data \  
--new-datadir /var/lib/edb/as17/data \  
--username enterprisedb \
--old-port 5444 \
--new-port 5444 \
--check
```

A successful check should return output as shown:
```

!!! Note
You can use the `--link` option for a hard link. This option works if both the data dirs are on the same filesystem.  For more information, see [pg_upgrade](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgupgrade.html) in the PostgreSQL documentation.

## Post-upgrade steps

### Update the Postgres service file

Update the server version, data directory, and binary directories of the new server in the PostgreSQL service file, located at `/etc/systemd/system/postgres.service`. 

An example of what the updated service file looks like:

```
[Unit]
Description=Postgres 17 (TPA)
After=syslog.target
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
User=enterprisedb
Group=enterprisedb
OOMScoreAdjust=-1000
Environment=PG_OOM_ADJUST_VALUE=0
Environment=PGDATA=/var/lib/edb/as17/data
StandardOutput=syslog
ExecStart=/usr/edb/as17/bin/edb-postgres -D ${PGDATA} -c config_file=/var/lib/edb/as17/data/postgresql.conf
ExecStartPost=+/bin/bash -c 'echo 0xff > /proc/$MAINPID/coredump_filter'
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID
KillMode=mixed
KillSignal=SIGINT
Restart=no
LimitCORE=infinity

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

### Start the postgres service
Execute a daemon-reload and start the Postgres service.

```bash       
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl start postgres
```

!!! Note
If your server was not running as a service, you can skip the service file update and start the server using the pg_ctl utility.
!!!

### Verify the upgraded cluster versions

```bash
pgd-a1:/home/rocky $ /usr/edb/as17/bin/pgd nodes list --versions
```
```
 Node Name  | BDR Version         | Postgres Version 
------------+---------------------+------------------
 pgd-a1     | PGD 6.1.0 Essential | 17.6.0           
 pgd-a2     | 5.9.0               | 13.22.28         
 witness-a1 | 5.9.0               | 13.22.28         
```

The BDR version for node **pgd-a1** was upgraded to 6.1.0 and the Postgres version to 17.6.0.

### Unfence the node

Unfence a node in this cluster with `pgd node <node-name> set-option route_fence false` so that it does not become the write leader.

### Verify the Connection Manager is working

Execute a query through the connection manager port (6444 by default) on the upgraded node:
```sql
pgd-a1:/home/rocky $ psql "host=pgd-a1 port=6444 dbname=bdrdb user=enterprisedb " -c "select node_name from bdr.local_node_summary;"
```
```
 node_name 
-----------
 pgd-a2
(1 row)
```

!!! Note
If PGD Proxy is running on the same host and using the Connection Manager port (default 6444), you must stop it before starting the new server. Otherwise, the startup will fail due to a port conflict.
!!!

### Clean up and vacuum analyze

As a best practice, run a vacuum over the database at this point. When the upgrade ran, you may have noticed the post-upgrade report included:

```
Upgrade Complete
----------------
Optimizer statistics are not transferred by pg_upgrade.
Once you start the new server, consider running:
    /usr/edb/as17/bin/vacuumdb -U enterprisedb --all --analyze-in-stages
Running this script will delete the old cluster's data files:
    ./delete_old_cluster.sh
```
You can run the vacuum now. On the target node, run:

```bash
/usr/edb/as17/bin/vacuumdb -U enterprisedb --all --analyze-in-stages
```

If you're sure you don't need to revert this node, you can also clean up the old cluster's data files:

```bash
./delete_old_cluster.sh 
```
### Upgrade the remaining nodes

You must perform these steps for every node in the cluster. The only difference will be the node name in the upgrade command. For quick reference, the commands for nodes **pgd-a2** and **witness-a1** are provided:

Node **pgd-a2**

```bash
/usr/edb/as17/bin/pgd node pgd-a2 upgrade \  
--database bdrdb -B /usr/edb/as17/bin \
--socketdir /tmp \
--old-bindir /usr/edb/as13/bin \
--old-datadir /opt/postgres/data \
--new-datadir /var/lib/edb/as17/data \
--username enterprisedb \
--old-port 5444 \ 
--new-port 5444
```

Node **witness-a1**

```bash
/usr/edb/as17/bin/pgd node witness-a1 upgrade \  
--database bdrdb -B /usr/edb/as17/bin \
--socketdir /tmp \
--old-bindir /usr/edb/as13/bin \
--old-datadir /opt/postgres/data \
--new-datadir /var/lib/edb/as17/data \
--username enterprisedb \
--old-port 5444 \ 
--new-port 5444
```

### Verify the final state of the cluster

```bash
pgd-a2:/home/rocky $ /usr/edb/as17/bin/pgd nodes list --versions
```
```
 Node Name  | BDR Version          | Postgres Version 
------------+----------------------+------------------
 pgd-a1     | PGD 6.1.0 Essential  | 17.6.0           
 pgd-a2     | PGD 6.1.0 Essential  | 17.6.0           
 witness-a1 | PGD 6.1.0 Essential  | 17.6.0           
```

All nodes of the cluster have been upgraded to PGD 6.1.0 and EPAS 17.6.0.

### Verify the Connection Manager for every data node 

```sql
pgd-a2:/home/rocky $ psql "host=pgd-a2 port=6444 dbname=bdrdb user=enterprisedb " -c "select node_name from bdr.local_node_summary;"
```
```
 node_name 
-----------
 pgd-a1
(1 row)
```
```sql
pgd-a2:/home/rocky $ psql "host=pgd-a2 port=6445 dbname=bdrdb user=enterprisedb " -c "select node_name from bdr.local_node_summary;"
```
```
 node_name 
-----------
 pgd-a2
(1 row)
```
This completes the worked example of an in-place major version rolling upgrade (PGD & Postgres) of a 3-node PGD 5, EPAS 13 cluster to PGD 6, EPAS 17 cluster.
