- relnote: Update the `pgd group get-option` and `pgd group show` commands to show default values.

    The `pgd group get-option` and `pgd group show` commands will now display the default values for all options.
    The `pgd group show` command will display the source of the option values as well.

  type: Enhancement

- relnote: Apply the PGD Essential constraints for CLI commands.
  details: |
    The CLI will check for and enforce the PGD Essential constraints for the commands as applicable.
    See [PGD Essential CLI Constraints](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs//pgd/latest/essential-how-to/pgd-cli/#pgd-essential-constraints) for more details.
  jira:  BDR-6752
  type: Enhancement
  impact: High

- relnote: Remove the group option `listen_address`.
  details: |
    The Connection Manager will use the value from the `listen_addressess` GUC and hence this option is no longer needed.
  jira:  BDR-6577
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: Highest

- relnote: Fix the `pgd cluster verify` command warning for `witness-only` group.
  details: |
    The `pgd cluster verify` command displayed warning for `Data nodes per group` check for `witness-only` group.
    The check is not applicable for `witness-only` groups and hence the status `Ok` will be displayed.
  jira:  BDR-6729

  type: Bug Fix
  impact: High

- relnote: Fix the multi-group cluster creation issue for `pgd node setup` command warning.
  details: |
    The `pgd node setup` command failed to create the second group if the `--cluster-name` option is not specified explicitly as it couldn't fetch the parent group name for the given group.
    The command will now use the global group name explicitly if the parent group name for the given group is not found.
  jira:  BDR-6762
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: High

- relnote: Skip the node GUCs update with `pgd node setup` command.
  details: |
    The `pgd node setup` verifies the Postgres settings while setting up a PGD node.
    The command will now skip the node GUCs update as the `bdr_superuser` role, used by CLI is not allowed to run ALTER SYSTEM queries.
    The command will continue to verify the Postgres settings and will display a warning message if any of the settings require modification.
  jira:  BDR-6763, BDR-6842
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: Medium
  
- relnote: Fix the data dir check for the setup command.
  details: |
    The `pgd node setup` command checks for the presence of `PG_VERSION` file in the given data dir option. 
    However the code incorrectly uses the `bindir` option instead of `pgdata`.
