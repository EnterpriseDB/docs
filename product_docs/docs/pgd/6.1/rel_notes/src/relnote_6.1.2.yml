- relnote: Fix handling of ALTER TABLE command in a streamed transaction
  details: |
    When an ALTER TABLE command, which uses the newly introduced table rewrite support, is streamed to a file or a writer, the step that creates a temporary table was not getting executed at all. Thus the subsequent writes to the table were failing, resulting in a data loss. This is now fixed by properly implementing a stream message callback method. (BDR-7249)
