intro: |
  EDB Postgres Distributed 6.1.1 includes only bug fixes focused on improving stability and reliability. No new features or enhancements are included in this release. Please see the details below.

relnotes:
- relnote: Fix physical join when running 'pgd node setup'
  details: |
    The `pgd node setup` command in the PGD CLI has been fixed to correctly set up a physical copy as a physical replica. Previously, a bug prevented the command from properly configuring physical replication which could result in some changes being missed on the new node. For any nodes added using `pgd node setup` with earlier versions of the PGD CLI, we recommend performing a consistency check.
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: Medium

- relnote: Fix handling of DDL commands that trigger table rewrites
  details: |
    Executing specific DDL operations (such as `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT <volatile expression>` or `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET DATA TYPE` when not binary-compatible) could cause replication failures. With this fix in PGD 6.1.1, replication now correctly handles DDL commands that trigger table rewrites.
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: Medium

- relnote: Connection Manager respects currentSchema JDBC parameter
  details: |
    Previously, a JDBC client connected through the PGD Connection Manager would have the `currentSchema` parameter ignored. As a result, a connection's `search_path` would incorrectly default to `public`. This issue has now been resolved.

  impact: Medium

- relnote: prefer_analytics_engine works with Iceberg REST Catalog tables
  details: |
    The `prefer_analytics_engine` flag has been updated to correctly function with tables that are replicated to Iceberg REST Catalog. Setting `bdr.prefer_analytics_engine = true` will now cause a query referencing a table with `pgaa.replicate_to_analytics = true` to be executed by the analytics engine when possible.
