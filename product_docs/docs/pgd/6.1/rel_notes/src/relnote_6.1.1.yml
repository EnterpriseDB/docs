relnotes:
- relnote: Fix handling of DDL commands that trigger table rewrites
  details: |
    Executing specific DDL operations (such as `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT <volatile expression>` or `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET DATA TYPE` when not binary-compatible) could cause replication failures. With this fix in PGD 6.1.1, replication now correctly handles DDL commands that trigger table rewrites.
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: Medium

- relnote: Connection Manager respects currentSchema parameter
  details: |
    Previously, Connection Manager ignored the `currentSchema` parameter passed by clients. As a result, a connection's `search_path` would incorrectly default to `public`. This issue has now been resolved.
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: Medium

- relnote: prefer_analytics_engine works with Iceberg REST Catalog tables
  details: |
    The `prefer_analytics_engine` flag has been updated to correctly function with tables that are replicated to Iceberg REST Catalog. Setting `bdr.prefer_analytics_engine = true` will now cause a query referencing a table with `pgaa.replicate_to_analytics = true` to be executed by the analytics engine when possible.
  type: Bug Fix
