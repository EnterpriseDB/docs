## Bug Fixes

<table class="table w-100"><thead><tr><th>Description</th><th width="10%">Addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><details><summary>Fix physical join when running 'pgd node setup'</summary><hr/><p>The <code>pgd node setup</code> command in the PGD CLI has been fixed to correctly set up a physical copy as a physical replica. Previously, a bug prevented the command from properly configuring physical replication which could result in some changes being missed on the new node. For any nodes added using <code>pgd node setup</code> with earlier versions of the PGD CLI, we recommend performing a consistency check.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Fix handling of DDL commands that trigger table rewrites</summary><hr/><p>Executing specific DDL operations (such as <code>ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT &lt;volatile expression&gt;</code> or <code>ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET DATA TYPE</code> when not binary-compatible) could cause replication failures. With this fix in PGD 6.1.1, replication now correctly handles DDL commands that trigger table rewrites.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>Connection Manager respects currentSchema JDBC parameter</summary><hr/><p>Previously, a JDBC client connected through the PGD Connection Manager would have the <code>currentSchema</code> parameter ignored. As a result, a connection's <code>search_path</code> would incorrectly default to <code>public</code>. This issue has now been resolved.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td><details><summary>prefer_analytics_engine works with Iceberg REST Catalog tables</summary><hr/><p>The <code>prefer_analytics_engine</code> flag has been updated to correctly function with tables that are replicated to Iceberg REST Catalog. Setting <code>bdr.prefer_analytics_engine = true</code> will now cause a query referencing a table with <code>pgaa.replicate_to_analytics = true</code> to be executed by the analytics engine when possible.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
