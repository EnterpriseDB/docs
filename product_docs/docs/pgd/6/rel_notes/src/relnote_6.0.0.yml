- relnote: Table rewriting `ALTER TABLE... ALTER COLUMN` calls are now supported. 
  details: |
    Changing a column's type command which causes the whole table to be rewritten and the change isn't binary coercible is now supported:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE foo (c1 int,c2 int, c3 int, c4 box, UNIQUE(c1, c2) INCLUDE(c3,c4));
    ALTER TABLE foo ALTER c1 TYPE bigint; â€“ results into table rewrite
    ```
    This also includes support for `ALTER TYPE` when using the `USING` clause:
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE foo (id serial primary key,data text);
    ALTER TABLE foo ALTER data TYPE BYTEA USING data::bytea;
    ```
    Table rewrites can hold an AccessExclusiveLock for extended periods on larger tables.
