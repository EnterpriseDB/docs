With PGD 6 Expanded, you can deploy a cluster in a wide range of architectures. Unlike PGD 6 Essential, which is limited to two architectures made with a limited number of groups, PGD 6 Expanded supports multiple architectures with technically unlimited groups, including:

* **Standard/One-location architecture**: A single PGD cluster with three nodes in the same data center or availability zone; The PGD 6 Essential architecture.
* **Multi-location architecture**: A single PGD cluster with two or more groups in different data centers or availability zones.
* **Geo-distributed architecture**: A single PGD cluster with two or more groups in different regions.
