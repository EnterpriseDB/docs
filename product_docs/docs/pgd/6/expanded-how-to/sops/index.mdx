## Overview

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are a set of procedures that are expanded for the successful operation of EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD). These procedures cover various aspects of the system, including installation, configuration, backup and restore, upgrades, monitoring, and troubleshooting.

SOPs are designed to address the most common tasks around using and maintaining a PGD cluster. They provide a structured approach to performing these tasks, ensuring consistency and reliability in operations. Read more about the structure of SOPs in the [How to Use SOPs](/pgd/latest/expanded-how-to/sops/how-to-use-sops).

This document provides an overview of the SOPs and links to detailed instructions for each procedure.

## [Installation and Configuration](/pgd/latest/expanded-how-to/sops/install)

The SOPs in this section cover the procedures for installing PGD, creating a new PGD cluster, adding a node to an existing cluster, and configuring PGD.

## [Data Movement](/pgd/latest/expanded-how-to/sops/data-movement)

The SOPs in this section cover the procedures for moving data into or out of a PGD cluster. This include importing and exporting data efficiently.

## [Monitoring](/pgd/latest/expanded-how-to/sops/monitoring)

The SOPs in this section cover the procedures for monitoring a Postgres Distributed (PGD) cluster. Monitoring is crucial for maintaining the health and performance of your database system.

## [Maintenance](/pgd/latest/expanded-how-to/sops/maintenance)

The SOPs in this section cover the procedures for maintaining a Postgres Distributed (PGD) cluster. It covers routine maintenance tasks and how they should be performed when working with a PGD cluster.

## [Backup and Restore](/pgd/latest/expanded-how-to/sops/backup-restore)

The SOPs in this section cover the process of backing up and restoring the Postgres database servers running on the nodes in a PGD cluster. 

## [Upgrade](/pgd/latest/expanded-how-to/sops/upgrade)

The SOPs in this section cover the process of upgrading the Postgres database servers running on the nodes in a PGD cluster and upgrade PGD itself. This includes minor and major upgrades of Postgres.

## [Troubleshooting](/pgd/latest/expanded-how-to/sops/troubleshooting)

The SOPs in this section cover the procedures for troubleshooting common issues that may arise in a Postgres Distributed (PGD) cluster. It includes steps to diagnose and resolve problems effectively.
