You can work around some of the limitations of PGD DDL operation handling.
Often splitting the operation into smaller changes can produce the desired
result that either isn't allowed as a single statement or requires excessive
locking.

## Adding a CONSTRAINT

You can add `CHECK` and `FOREIGN KEY` constraints without requiring a DML lock.
This involves a two-step process:

- `ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ... NOT VALID`
- `ALTER TABLE ... VALIDATE CONSTRAINT`

Execute these steps in two different transactions. Both of these
steps take DDL lock only on the table and hence can be run even when one
or more nodes are down. But to validate a constraint, PGD must
ensure that:

- All nodes in the cluster see the `ADD CONSTRAINT` command. 
- The node validating the constraint applied replication changes from all other nodes prior to 
    creating the NOT VALID constraint on those nodes. 

So even though the new mechanism doesn't need all nodes
to be up while validating the constraint, it still requires that all
nodes applied the `ALTER TABLE .. ADD CONSTRAINT ... NOT VALID`
command and made enough progress. PGD waits for a consistent
state to be reached before validating the constraint.

The new facility requires the cluster to run with Raft protocol
version 24 and later. If the Raft protocol isn't yet upgraded, the old
mechanism is used, resulting in a DML lock request.
