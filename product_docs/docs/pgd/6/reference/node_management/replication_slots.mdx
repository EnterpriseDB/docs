title: Replication slots created by PGD
---

In previous versions of PGD, replication slots had human-readable names. With PGD 6, that has switched over to using UUIDs for nodes and groups
to ensure better identification.

Replication slots are used by PostgreSQL to track the progress of replication. They are used to ensure that the data being replicated
is not lost and that the replication process is consistent. In PGD, replication slots are used to track the progress of replication
between nodes in a cluster. Each node in a PGD cluster has its own replication slots, which are used to track the progress of replication
to and from that node. Replication slots are also used to track the progress of replication between groups in a PGD cluster. Each group
in a PGD cluster has its own replication slots, which are used to track the progress of replication to and from that group.

- One group slot, named `bdr_<topgroupuuid>_<dbhash>`
- N-1 node slots named `bdr_node_<targetnodeuuid>_<dbhash>`, where N is the total number of nodes in the cluster, including direct logical standbys, if any.

Where `topgroupuuid` is the UUID of the top-level group and `dbhash` is a hash of the database name. You can obtain the UUID of the top-level group using

```sql
select node_group_uuid from bdr.node_group where node_group_parent_id=0;
```

And `dbhash` is a hash of the database name. You can obtain the hash using:

```sql
select to_hex(hashtext('pgddb'));
```

And the `targetnodeuuid` is the UUID of the target node. You can obtain the UUID of the target node using:

```sql
select node_uuid from bdr.node where node_name='<target_node_name>';
```

The complete group slot name is returned by the function [`bdr.local_group_slot_name()`](/pgd/latest/reference/tables-views-functions/functions#bdrlocal_group_slot_name).

!!! Warning
    Don't drop those slots. PGD creates and manages them and drops them when or if necessary.
    * Avoid touching slots prefixed with `bdr_` slots directly.
    * And do not start slot names with the prefix `bdr_`.

## Group slot

The group slot is used to track the progress of
replication between groups in a PGD cluster. Each group in a PGD
cluster has its own group slot, which is used to track the progress of

The group slot is used to:

- Join new nodes to the PGD group without having all existing nodes
    up and running (although the majority of nodes should be up). This process doesn't
    incur data loss in case the node that was down during join starts
    replicating again.
- Part nodes from the cluster consistently, even if some nodes haven't
    caught up fully with the parted node.
- Hold back the freeze point to avoid missing some conflicts.
- Keep the historical snapshot for timestamp-based snapshots.

The group slot is usually inactive and is fast forwarded only periodically
in response to Raft progress messages from other nodes.

!!! Warning
    Don't drop the group slot. Although usually inactive, it's
    still vital to the proper operation of the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster. If you drop it,
    then some or all of PGD's features can stop working or have incorrect outcomes.

## Other slot names

Other functionality within PGD makes use of replication slots.

For example, when a node is added to a group, a slot is created for that node to track its progress in the replication process.

This slot is named `bdr_node_<targetnodeuuid>_<dbhash>_tmp`.

There are also slots created for the analytics and decoding features of PGD.
These slots are named:

| Slot type                              | Slot name                                          |
|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Forwarding slot, leader-to-leader slot | `bdr_node_<targetnodeuuid>_<originidhex>_<dbhash>` |
| Analytics slot                         | `bdr_analytics_<groupuuid>_<dbhash>`               |
| Decoding slot                          | `bdr_decoder_<topgroupuuid>_<dbhash>`              |
