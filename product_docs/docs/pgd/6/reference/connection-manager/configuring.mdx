## Configuring Connection Manager

Connection Manager takes its configuration from the PGD Group options for the group the node is a member of.

These can be configured using the [`bdr.alter_node_group_option`](/pgd/latest/reference/tables-views-functions/nodes-management-interfaces#bdralter_node_group_option) command, or using the [`pgd group set-option`](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/command_ref/group/set-option/) command.

The following options are available for configuring Connection Manager:

| Option                            | Default                                   | Description                                                                                |

| listen_address                    | Postgres's listen address                 | which local addresses it should listen on for client connections                           |
| read_write_port                   | Postgres's port + 1000<br/>(usually 6432) | which port to listen on for read-write connections                                         |
| read_only_port                    | Postgres's port + 1001<br/>(usually 6433) | which port to listen on for read-only connections                                          |
| http_port                         | Postgres's port + 1002<br/>(usually 6434) | which http port to listen for REST API calls (for integration purposes)                    |

| read_write_max_client_connections | max_connection                            | maximum read-write client connections allowed, defaults to max_connections                 |
| read_write_max_server_connections | max_connections                           | maximum read-write connections that will be opened to server                               |
| read_only_max_client_connections  | max_connections                           | maximum read-only client connections allowed                                               |
| read_only_max_server_connections  | max_connections                           | maximum read-only connections that will be opened to server                                |
| read_write_consensus_timeout      | 0 (immediate action)                      | how long to wait on loss of consensus before read-write connections are no longer accepted |
| read_only_consensus_timeout       | 0 (immediate action)                      | how long to wait on loss of consensus before read-only connections are no longer accepted. |
