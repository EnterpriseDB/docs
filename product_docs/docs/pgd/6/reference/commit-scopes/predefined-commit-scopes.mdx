Both PGD Essential and PGD Expanded provide a set of predefined commit scopes that are available for use.

The difference between the two editions is that PGD Essential has a limited set of predefined commit scopes that cannot be changed, while PGD Expanded allows for fully manageable and configurable commit scopes. The predefined commit scopes in PGD Essential are designed to provide a balance between performance and data safety, while the configurable commit scopes in PGD Expanded offer more flexibility and control over the durability guarantees.

## `local protect`

```text
ASYNCHRONOUS COMMIT
```

The `local protect` commit scope is the default commit scope for PGD Essential. 
It provides asynchronous commit with no durability guarantees. 
This means that transactions are considered committed as soon as they are written to the local node's WAL, without waiting for any confirmation from other nodes in the cluster.

This commit scope is suitable for scenarios where high availability and low latency are more important than data durability. 
However, it does not provide any guarantees against data loss in case of node failures or network issues.

## `lag protect`

```text
MAJORITY ORIGIN GROUP LAG CONTROL (max_lag_time = 30s, max_commit_delay = 10s)
```

The `lag protect` commit scope provides a durability guarantee based on the lag time of the majority origin group. 
It ensures that transactions are considered committed only when the lag time is within a specified limit (30 seconds in this case) and the commit delay is also within a specified limit (10 seconds in this case). 
This helps to prevent data loss in case of network issues or node failures.

This commit scope is useful in scenarios where data consistency and durability are important, but some latency is acceptable. 
It allows for a balance between performance and data safety by ensuring that transactions are not considered committed until they have been confirmed by the majority of nodes in the origin group within the specified lag and commit delay limits.

## `majority protect`

```text
MAJORITY ORIGIN GROUP SYNCHRONOUS COMMIT
```

The `majority protect` commit scope provides a durability guarantee based on the majority origin group. 
It ensures that transactions are considered committed only when they are confirmed by the majority of nodes in the origin group. 
This helps to ensure data consistency and durability in case of node failures or network issues.

This commit scope is suitable for scenarios where data consistency and durability are critical, and it provides a higher level of protection against data loss compared to the `local protect` commit scope.
However, it may introduce some latency due to the need for confirmation from multiple nodes before considering a transaction as committed.

## `adaptive protect`

```text
MAJORITY ORIGIN GROUP SYNCHRONOUS COMMIT DEGRADE ON (timeout = 10s, require_write_lead = true) TO ASYNCHRONOUS COMMIT
```

The `adaptive protect` commit scope provides a more flexible durability guarantee. 
It allows transactions to be considered committed based on the majority origin group synchronous commit, but it can degrade to asynchronous commit if the transaction cannot be confirmed within a specified timeout (10 seconds in this case). 
This is useful in scenarios where network latency or node failures may cause delays in confirming transactions.

This commit scope is suitable for scenarios where data consistency and durability are important, but some flexibility is needed to handle potential delays.
It provides a balance between performance and data safety by allowing transactions to be considered committed even if they cannot be confirmed by the majority of nodes within the specified timeout, while still providing a higher level of protection compared to the `local protect` commit scope.
