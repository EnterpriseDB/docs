## Overview

While many use cases rely on accessing a database node which can handle queries and updates, there are also use cases which only require access to a node that can handle read-only database queries.
Read scaling like this, by moving the read-only traffic away from active database nodes in the cluster, can improve the performance of the core cluster, whilst making database access more widely available.

## Subscriber-only nodes

The basic idea of subscriber-only nodes is to provide a read-only node that you can use to offload read-only queries from the main cluster.
The default topology of a PGD cluster is what's called a full mesh topology, where every node connects to every other node.
This is the most robust and fault-tolerant way to connect nodes, but it can be inefficient for some use cases.

Subscriber-only nodes can be a member of a subscriber-only group or, with PGD 6 and later, they can be part of a data group.

## Subscriber-only groups

Subscriber-only groups in PGD gather together subscriber-only nodes. Each group can address different regions or different application demands.

Unlike data groups, a subscriber-only group has no raft consensus mechanism of its own. This also means that a subscriber-only group can have as many subscriber-only nodes as your need.

Previous to PGD 6, the existence of a subscriber-only group didn't change the replication topology. All nodes in the subscriber-only group, by default, independently receive replicated changes from all other nodes in the cluster.

## Optimizing subscriber-only groups

In PGD 6 and later, you can optionally optimize the topology of subscriber-only groups.

For clusters using proxies and raft-enabled groups for their data nodes, subscriber-only groups can use a more efficient model for receiving replicated changes.

The optimized topology option creates a group leader in each subscriber-only group, similar to a write leader in PGD Proxies. The group leader receives all the changes from the cluster and then replicates them to the other nodes in its group. See [Optimizing subscriber-only groups](optimizing-so) for more information on this feature.

## Subscriber-only nodes and DDL

Subscriber-only nodes can execute locally issued DDL commands but they don't replicate those changes to other nodes in the cluster and will not attempt to acquire locks on the cluster.
