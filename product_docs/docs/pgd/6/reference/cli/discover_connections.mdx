You can install PGD CLI on any system that can connect to the PGD cluster. To use PGD CLI, you need a user with PGD superuser privileges or equivalent. The PGD user with superuser privileges is the [bdr_superuser role](../security). An example of an equivalent user is edb_admin on an EDB Cloud Service distributed high-availability cluster.

## PGD CLI and database connection strings

You might not need a database connection string. For example, when Trusted Postgres Architect installs the PGD CLI on a system, it also configures the connection to the PGD cluster. This means that PGD CLI can connect to the cluster when run. 

## Getting your database connection string

Because of the range of different configurations that PGD supports, every deployment method has a different way of deriving a connection string for it. Generally, you can obtain the required information from the configuration of your deployment. You can then assemble that information into connection strings.

### For a cluster deployed with EDB CloudNative Postgres Global Cluster

If you are using EDB CloudNative Postgres Global Cluster (CNPG-GC), the connection string is derived from the configuration of the deployment. It is very flexible so there are multiple ways to obtain a connection string. It depends, in large part, on the configuration of the deployment's [services](/postgres_distributed_for_kubernetes/latest/connectivity/#services): 

- If you use the Node Service Template, direct connectivity to each node and proxy service is available. 
- If you use the Group Service Template, there's a gateway service to each group. 
- If you use the Proxy Service Template, a single proxy provides an entry point to the cluster for all applications. 

** TODO [DOCS-1499] : remove proxy references when CNPG-GC is updated to use PGD6 CM **

Consult your configuration file to determine this information. 

Establish a host name or IP address, port, database name, and username. The default database name is `pgddb`. The default username is enterprisedb for EDB Postgres Advanced Server and postgres for PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Extended Server.

You can then assemble a connection string based on that information:

```
"host=<hostnameOrIPAddress> port=<portnumber> dbname=<databasename> user=<username>"
```

If the deployment's configuration requires it, add `sslmode=<sslmode>`.
