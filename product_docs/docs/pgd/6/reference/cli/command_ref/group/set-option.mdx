## Synopsis

The `pgd group set-option` command is used to set group-level options in the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

## Syntax

```plaintext
pgd group <GROUP_NAME> set-option [OPTIONS] <OPTION> <VALUE>
```

Where `<GROUP_NAME>` is the name of the group for which you want to get options.

And `<OPTION>` is the name of a specific group option you want to get and `<VALUE>` is the value you want it set to. 

The following options are available:
