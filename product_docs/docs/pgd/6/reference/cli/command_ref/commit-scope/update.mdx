## Synopsis

The `pgd commit-scope update` command is used to update a commit scope in the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

## Syntax

```plaintext
pgd commit-scope <COMMIT_SCOPE> update [OPTIONS] <RULE_DEFINITION>[GROUP_NAME]
```

Where `<COMMIT_SCOPE>` is the name of the commit scope to update.

The `<RULE_DEFINITION>` is the rule that defines the commit scope. The rule specifies the conditions that must be met for a transaction to be considered committed. See [Commit Scopes](/pgd/latest/reference/commit-scopes) and [Commit Scope Rules](/pgd/latest/reference/commit-scopes/commit-scope-rules/) for more information on the rule syntax.

The optional `[GROUP_NAME]` is the name of the group to which the commit scope belongs. If omitted, it defaults to the top-level group.

## Options

No command specific options. See [Global Options](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/command_ref/#global-options).

## Examples

### Updating a Commit Scope

The following example updates the commit scope `abc1` with the rule `ANY 1 (dc1_subgroup) SYNCHRONOUS COMMIT`:

```shell
pgd commit-scope abc1 update "ANY 1 (dc1_subgroup) SYNCHRONOUS COMMIT" dc1_subgroup
__OUTPUT__
Command executed successfully
```

### Updating a Commit Scope in the Top-Level Group

The following example updates the commit scope `abc2` with the rule `ANY 1 (dc1_subgroup) SYNCHRONOUS COMMIT` in the top-level group:

```shell
pgd commit-scope abc2 update "ANY 1 (dc1_subgroup) SYNCHRONOUS COMMIT"
__OUTPUT__
Command executed successfully
```
