## Synopsis

The `pgd assess` commands are used to assess the suitability of a Postgres server instance for migration to the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

The command must be run with a DSN that connects to the Postgres server instance that you want to assess. This can be passed as the argument to the `--dsn` option, or by setting the `PGD_CLI_DSN` environment variable. Not doing either one will result in an error.

The command will then check the Postgres server instance for compatibility with the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster, and will provide a report on the compatibility of the Postgres server instance.

## Syntax

```plaintext
pgd assess [OPTIONS]
```

## Options

The assess command has no command specific options. But it does require a DSN to connect to the Postgres server instance that you want to assess. This can be passed as the argument to the `--dsn` option, or by setting the `PGD_CLI_DSN` environment variable.
