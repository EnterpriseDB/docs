## Synopsis

The `pgd node setup` command is used to configure PGD data nodes in a cluster. It can be used to set up a new node, join an existing node to a cluster, or perform a logical join of a node to the cluster.

The behavior of the command depends on the state of the local node and the remote node specified in the command.

If this is the first node in the cluster, `pgd node setup` will perform `initdb` and setup PGD node.

If this is not the first node, but the local node is not up and running, `pgd node setup` will perform a physical join of the node to the cluster. This will copy the data from the remote node to the local node as part of the initialization process, then join the local node to the cluster. This is the fastest way to load data into a new node.

If the local node is up and running and remote node also is reachable, `pgd node setup` will perform a logical join of the node to the cluster. This will create a new node in the cluster and start streaming replication from the remote node. This is the recommended way to add a new node to an existing cluster.

If the local node is up and running and remote node dsn is not provided, `pgd node setup` will do a node group switch if node not part of the given group.

### Users and roles

The `pgd node setup` command requires a superuser role to run. The superuser role is used to create the data directory and initialize the database. The superuser role must have the `CREATEDB` privilege to create the database.

The user specified in the `--dsn` option will be created if it does not exist. It will only be granted the `bdr_superuser` role which will allow it to administer PGD functionality. It will not, though have any other privileges on the database.

## Syntax

```plaintext
pgd node <NODE_NAME> setup [OPTIONS] -D <PG_DATA>
```

## Arguments

- <NODE_NAME\> The name of the node to be created. This is the name that will be used to identify the node in the cluster. It must be unique within the cluster.

## Examples

In these examples, we will set up a cluster with on three hosts, `host-1`, `host-2` and `host-3`, to create three nodes: `node-1`, `node-2`, and `node-3`.
The three nodes will be data nodes, and part of a cluster named `pgd` with the group name `group-1`.

We recommend that you export the PGPASSWORD environment variable to avoid having to enter the password for the `pgdadmin` user each time you run a command. You can do this with the following command:

```shell
export PGPASSWORD=pgdsecret
```

### Configuring the first node

```shell
pgd node node-1 setup --dsn "host=host-1 port=5432 user=pgdadmin dbname=pgddb" \
--listen-addr "localhost,host-1" \
--group-name group-1 --cluster-name pgd \
-D /var/lib/edb-pge/17/main
```

Stepping through the command, we are setting up `node-1`. The first option is the `--dsn` option, which is the connection string for the node. This is typically set to `host=hostname port=5432 user=pgdadmin dbname=pgd`, which is a typical connection string for a local Postgres instance.

The `--listen-address` option is used to specify the address that the node will listen on for incoming connections. In this case, we are setting it to `localhost,host-1`, which means that the node will listen on both the localhost and the `host-1` address.

This is the first node in the cluster, so we set the group name to `group-1` and the cluster name to `pgd` (which is actually the default). As this is the first node in the cluster, the `--create-group` option is automatically set.

Finally, we set the data directory for the node with the `-D` option; this is where the Postgres data files will be stored. In this example, we are using `/var/lib/edb-pge/17/main` as the data directory.

The command will create the data directory and initialize the database correctly for PGD. It will then start the node and make it available for new connections, including the other nodes joining the cluster.


### Configuring a second node

```shell
pgd node node-2 setup --dsn "host=host-2 port=5432 user=pgdadmin dbname=pgddb" \
--listen-addr "localhost,host-2" \
-D /var/lib/edb-pge/17/main
--cluster-dsn "host=host-1 port=5432 user=pgdadmin dbname=pgddb"
```

This command is similar to the first node, but we are setting up `node-2`. The `--dsn` option is the connection string for the node, which is typically set to `host=hostname port=5432 user=pgdadmin dbname=pgd`. The `cluster-dsn` must point to an active node, it can point to connection manager, or proxy endpoint etc., CLI will get the real DSN of the node behind it. In this case, we are setting it to `host=host-1 port=5432 user=pgdadmin dbname=pgd`, which is the connection string for the first node in the cluster.

### Configuring a third node

```shell
pgd node node-3 setup --dsn "host=host-3 port=5432 user=pgdadmin dbname=pgddb" \
--listen-addr "localhost,host-3" \
--cluster-dsn "host=host-1 port=5432 user=pgdadmin dbname=pgddb" \
-D /var/lib/edb-pge/17/main
```

This command is similar to the second node, but we are setting up `node-3`. The `--dsn` option is the connection string for the node, which is typically set to `host=hostname port=5432 user=pgdadmin dbname=pgd`. The `cluster-dsn` must point to an active node, it can point to connection manager, or proxy endpoint etc., CLI will get the real DSN of the node behind it. In this case, we are setting it to `host=host-1 port=5432 user=pgdadmin dbname=pgd`, which is the connection string for the first node in the cluster.

### Joining a parted and dropped node to the cluster

```shell
pgd node node-2 setup --dsn "host=host-2 port=5432 user=pgdadmin dbname=pgddb" \
--listen-addr "localhost,host-2" \
--cluster-dsn "host=host-1 port=5432 user=pgdadmin dbname=pgddb" \
-D /var/lib/edb-pge/17/main
```

This command is similar to the setting up the subsequent nodes, but we are setting up `node-2` again. The `--dsn` option is the connection string for the node, which is typically set to `host=hostname port=5432 user=pgdadmin dbname=pgd`. The `cluster-dsn` must point to an active node, it can point to connection manager, or proxy endpoint etc., CLI will get the real DSN of the node behind it. In this case, we are setting it to `host=host-1 port=5432 user=pgdadmin dbname=pgd`, which is the connection string for the first node in the cluster.

This is useful when a node has been `parted` and `dropped` from the cluster for some activity like maintenance and needs to be rejoined to the cluster. The command will perform a logical join of the node to the cluster, which will create a new node in the cluster and start streaming replication from the remote node.
