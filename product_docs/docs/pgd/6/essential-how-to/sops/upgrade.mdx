This SOP covers the process of upgrading the Postgres database servers running on the nodes in a PGD cluster. There are two main upgrade paths: minor and major upgrades. Minor upgrades are typically performed to apply security patches or bug fixes, while major upgrades involve significant changes to the database engine and may require more extensive testing and planning.
