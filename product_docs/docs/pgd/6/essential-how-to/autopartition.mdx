Autopartitioning in PGD allows you to split tables automatically into several partitions, other tables, automatically creating and dropping those partitions are needed. Autopartitioning is useful for managing large tables that grow over time as it allows you to separate the data into manageable chunks. For example, you could archive older data into its own partition, and then archive, or drop the partition when the data is no longer needed.

### Autopartitioning and replication

PGD autopartitioning is managed, by default, locally through the `bdr.autopartition` functions. This function allows you to create or alter the definition of automatic range partitioning for a table. If no definition exists, it will create one; otherwise, it will alter the existing definition.

!!! Note EPAS automatic partitioning is not supported in PGD
EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) has native automatic partitioning support, but this is not available in EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD). PGD autopartitioning is a separate feature that allows you to manage partitions locally. If PGD is active on an EPAS node, native automatic partitioning commands are rejected. See [Autoparition Reference](/pgd/latest/reference/autopartition) for more information.

### RANGE partitioning

PGD autopartitioning support RANGE partitioning. RANGE partitioning allows you to partition a table based on a range of values in a column. For example, you could partition a table by date, where each partition contains data for a specific date range. This is useful for managing large tables that grow over time, as it allows you to separate the data into manageable chunks.
