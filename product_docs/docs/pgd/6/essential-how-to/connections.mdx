description: How to connect to your PGD cluster.

PGD Essential uses the same connection methods as Postgres. The difference is that most of your connections to the cluster go through the connection manager that's built into every data node in the cluster.

Although you can connect directly to the data nodes, we don't recommend it for anything other than maintenance when you want to work on a particular node's database instance.

For PGD Essential, you must connect to the cluster through the connection manager. PGD Essential is designed to be simple to deploy and manage, and that means the cluster has a write leader node that handles all the writes to the cluster. The connection manager is then responsible for directing your read-write connections to the write leader. All your client or application needs to do is to use the connection manager's port and the connection manager will handle the rest.

The connection manager is responsible for directing your writes to the write leader and ensuring that your reads are directed to the correct node in the cluster. If you connect directly to a data node, you may not be able to take advantage of these features. For applications that only need to read data, the connection manager can direct your reads to a node that isn't the write leader. This can help to balance the load on the cluster and improve performance.

## Connecting through the connection manager

Postgres is very flexible for configuring ports and connections, so for simplicity, this example uses the default port settings for Postgres and the connection manager. The default port for Postgres is 5432, and the default port for the connection manager is 6432.

You can use that port in your connection strings to connect to the cluster. So, for example, if you're using the psql command line tool, you can connect to the cluster like this:

```bash
psql -h host-1 -p 6432 -U pgdadmin -d pgddb
```

Where `host-1` is the hostname of the node you're connecting to. The connection manager will then direct your connection to the write leader node in the cluster.

## Connecting directly to a data node

You can connect directly to a data node in the cluster, but we don't recommend it. However, if you need to connect directly to a data node, you can use the following command:

```bash
psql -h host-1 -p 5432 -U pgdadmin -d pgddb
```
