The PGD CLI is a powerful command line interface for managing your PGD cluster. It can be used to perform a variety of tasks, including:

- Checking the health of the cluster
- Listing the nodes in the cluster
- Listing the groups in the cluster
- Setting group options
- Switching the write leader

If you have used the [installation guide](install) to install PGD, you will have already installed PGD CLI and used it to create the cluster.

## Using PGD CLI

The PGD CLI command uses a configuration file to work out the hosts to connect to. 
There are [options](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/using_cli) that allow you to override this to use alternative configuration files or explicitly point at a server. But, by default, PGD CLI looks for a configuration file in preset locations.

The connection to the database is authenticated in the same way as other command line utilities, like the psql command, are authenticated. 

Unlike other commands, PGD CLI doesn't interactively prompt for your password. Therefore, you must pass your password using one of the following methods:

- Adding an entry to your [`.pgpass` password file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html), which includes the host, port, database name, user name, and password
- Setting the password in the `PGPASSWORD` environment variable
- Including the password in the connection string

We recommend the first option, as the other options don't scale well with multiple database clusters, or they compromise password confidentiality.

### Configuring and connecting PGD CLI

- Ensure PGD CLI is installed.
  - If PGD CLI was already installed, move to the next step.
  - For any system, repeat the [configure repositories](install/02-configure-repositories) step on that system.
  - Then run the package installation command appropriate for that platform.
    - RHEL and derivatives: `sudo dnf install edb-pgd6-cli`
    - Debian, Ubuntu, and derivatives: `sudo apt-get install edb-pgd6-cli`
- Create a configuration file.
  - This is a YAML file that specifies the cluster and endpoints for PGD CLI to use.
- Install the configuration file.
  - Copy the YAML configuration file to a default config directory `/etc/edb/pgd-cli/` as `pgd-cli-config.yml`.
  - Repeat this process on any system where you want to run PGD CLI.
- Run pgd-cli.

### Use PGD CLI to explore the cluster

- Check the health of the cluster with the `cluster show --health` command.
- Show the nodes in the cluster with the `nodes list` command.
- Show the groups in the cluster with the `groups list` command.
- Set a group option with the `group set-option` command.
- Switch write leader with the `group set-leader` command.

For more details about these commands, see the worked example that follows.

Also consult the [PGD CLI documentation](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/) for details of other configuration options and a full command reference.

## Worked example

### Ensure PGD CLI is installed

In this worked example, you configure and use PGD CLI on host-1, where you've already installed Postgres and PGD.
You don't need to install PGD CLI again.

### (Optionally) Create a configuration file

The PGD CLI configuration file is a YAML file that contains a cluster object. 
This has two properties:

- The name of the PGD cluster's top-level group (as `name`)
- An array of endpoints of databases (as `endpoints`)

```
cluster:
  name: pgd
  endpoints:
    - host=host-1 dbname=bdrdb port=5444
    - host=host-2 dbname=bdrdb port=5444
    - host=host-3 dbname=bdrdb port=5444
```

Note that the endpoints in this example specify `port=5444`.
This is necessary for EDB Postgres Advanced Server instances.
For EDB Postgres Extended and community PostgreSQL, you can omit this.

Create the PGD CLI configuration directory:

```shell
sudo mkdir -p /etc/edb/pgd-cli
```

Then, write the configuration to the `pgd-cli-config.yml` file in the `/etc/edb/pgd-cli` directory.

For this example, you can run this on host-1 to create the file:

```shell
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/edb/pgd-cli/pgd-cli-config.yml
cluster:
  name: pgd
  endpoints:
    - host=host-1 dbname=bdrdb port=5444
    - host=host-2 dbname=bdrdb port=5444
    - host=host-3 dbname=bdrdb port=5444
EOF
```

You can repeat this process on any system where you need to use PGD CLI.

### Running PGD CLI

With the configuration file in place, and logged in as the enterprisedb system user, you can run pgd-cli. 
For example, you can use the `nodes list` command to list the nodes in your cluster and their status:

```shell
pgd nodes list
__OUTPUT__
Node Name Group Name   Node Kind Join State Node Status
---------  ----------- --------- ---------- -----------
node-1     group-1         data      ACTIVE     Up         
node-2     group-1         data      ACTIVE     Up         
node-3     group-1         data      ACTIVE     Up 
```

### Using PGD CLI to explore the cluster

Once PGD CLI is configured, you can use it to get PGD-level views of the cluster.

### Check the health of the cluster

The [`cluster show --health`](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/command_ref/cluster/show/#options) command provides a quick way to view the health of the cluster:

```shell
pgd cluster show --health
__OUTPUT__
Check             Status Details
----------------- ------ -----------------------------------------------
Connections       Ok     All BDR nodes are accessible
Raft              Ok     Raft Consensus is working correctly
Replication Slots Ok     All PGD replication slots are working correctly
Clock Skew        Ok     Clock drift is within permissible limit
Versions          Ok     All nodes are running the same PGD version
```

### Show the nodes in the cluster

As previously seen, the [`nodes list`](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/command_ref/nodes/list/) command lists the nodes in the cluster:

```shell
pgd nodes list
__OUTPUT__
Node Name  Group Name  Node Kind Join State Node Status
---------- ----------- --------- ---------- -----------
node-1     group-1         data      ACTIVE     Up         
node-2     group-1         data      ACTIVE     Up         
node-3     group-1         data      ACTIVE     Up  
```

This view shows the group the node is a member of and its current status.
To find out what versions of PGD and Postgres are running on the nodes, use `nodes list --versions`:

```shell
pgd nodes list --versions
__OUTPUT__
Node Name BDR Version                   Postgres Version                
---------- ---------------------------  --------------------------------
node-1     5.7.0 (snapshot e2534db6d)   16.6 (Debian 16.6-1EDB.bullseye)
node-2     5.7.0 (snapshot e2534db6d)   16.6 (Debian 16.6-1EDB.bullseye)
node-3     5.7.0 (snapshot e2534db6d)   16.6 (Debian 16.6-1EDB.bullseye)
```

### Show the groups in the cluster

Finally, the [`groups list`](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/command_ref/groups/list/) command for PGD CLI shows which groups are configured, and more:

```
pgd groups list
__OUTPUT__
Group Name   Parent Group Name Group Type Nodes
------------ ----------------- ---------- -----
pgd                            global     0    
group-1      pgd               data       3    
```

This command shows:

- The groups
- Their types
- Their parent group
- The number of nodes in each group

### Set a group option

You can set group options using PGD CLI, too, using the [`group set-option`](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/command_ref/group/set-option/) command. 
If you wanted to set the `group-1` group's location to `London`, you would run:

```shell
pgd group group-1 set-option location London
__OUTPUT__
Status Message                      
------ -----------------------------
OK     Command executed successfully
```

You can verity the new location using the [`group get-option`](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/command_ref/group/get-option/) command:

```shell
pgd group group-1 get-option location
__OUTPUT__
Option Name Option Value
----------- ------------
location    London  
```

### Set the write leader

If you need to change write leader in a group, to enable maintenance on a host, PGD CLI offers the [`group set-leader`](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/command_ref/group/set-leader/) command.
You enter a group name after `group` and the name of the node you want to switch to after `set leader`:

```shell
pgd group group-1 set-leader node-2
__OUTPUT__
Status Message                      
------ -----------------------------
OK     Command executed successfully
```

You can verify the write leader using the [`group show command`](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/command_ref/group/show/) with the `--summary option`:

```shell
pgd group group-1 show --summary
__OUTPUT__
Group Property    Value       
----------------- ------------
Group Name        group-1
Parent Group Name pgd
Group Type        data        
Write Leader      node-2
Commit Scope                 
```

More details on the available commands in PGD CLI are available in the [PGD CLI command reference](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/command_ref/).
