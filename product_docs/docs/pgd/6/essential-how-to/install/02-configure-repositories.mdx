On each host which you want to use as a PGD data node, you need to install the database and the PGD software.

## Configure repositories

Set the following environment variables:

### `EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN`

This is the token you received when you registered for the EDB subscription. It is used to authenticate your access to the EDB repository.

```bash
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

### `EDB_REPO_TYPE`

This is the type of package manager you use, which informs the installer which type of package you need. This can be `deb` for Ubuntu/Debian or `rpm` for CentOS/RHEL.

```bash
export EDB_REPO_TYPE=<your-repo-type>
```

## Install the repositories

There are two repositories you need to configure: one for the database software and one for the PGD software. 

The following command will download and run a script that configures your package manager to use the EDB repository for databases.

```bash
curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/enterprise/setup.$EDB_REPO_TYPE.sh" | sudo -E bash
```

This command will download and run a script that configures your package manager to use the EDB repository. It will also install any necessary dependencies.

## Worked example

In this example, we will configure the repositories on a CentOS/RHEL system that will allow us to install EDB Postgres Extended Server 17 with PGD Essential with a standard subscription.

### Set the environment variables

```bash
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
export EDB_REPO_TYPE=rpm
curl -1sSLf " https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/enterprise/setup.$EDB_REPO_TYPE.sh" | sudo -E bash
```

The next step is to [install the database and PGD software](03-installing-database-and-pgd/).
