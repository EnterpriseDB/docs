On each host which you want to use as a PGD data node, you need to install the database and the PGD software.

## Configure repositories

Set the following environment variables:

### `EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN`

This is the token you received when you registered for the EDB subscription. It is used to authenticate your access to the EDB repository.

```bash
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

### `EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN`

This is the plan you subscribed to. It is used to determine which packages are available for installation. This is typically either `standard` or `enterprise`.

```bash
# Set the EDB subscription plan
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN=<your-plan>
```

### `EDB_REPO_TYPE`

This is the type of package manager you use, which informs the installer which type of package you need. This can be `deb` for Ubuntu/Debian or `rpm` for CentOS/RHEL.

```bash
export EDB_REPO_TYPE=<your-repo-type>
```

## Install the repository/repositories

For PGD Essential, there is just one repository to install. For PGD Extended, there are two repositories to install.

<TabContainer>

<Tab title="PGD Essential" active>

Run the following command to install the EDB repository. This will add the EDB repository to your system's package manager, allowing you to install EDB packages.

```bash
curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN/setup.$EDB_REPO_TYPE.sh" | sudo -E bash
```

</Tab>

<Tab title="Expanded">

```bash
curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN/setup.$EDB_REPO_TYPE.sh" | sudo -E bash
curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN/postgres_distributed/setup.$EDB_REPO_TYPE.sh" | sudo -E bash
```

</Tab>

</TabContainer>

This command will download and run a script that configures your package manager to use the EDB repository. It will also install any necessary dependencies.


## Worked example

In this example, we will configure the repositories on a CentOS/RHEL system that will allow us to install EDB Postgres Extended Server 17 with PGD Essential  using an enterprise subscription.

### Set the environment variables

```bash
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN=enterprise
export EDB_REPO_TYPE=rpm
curl -1sSLf " https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN/setup.$EDB_REPO_TYPE.sh" | sudo -E bash
```
