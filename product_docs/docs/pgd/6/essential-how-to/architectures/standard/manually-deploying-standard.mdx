Manually deploying the PGD Essential Standard architecture is a straightforward process. This architecture is designed for a single location that needs to be highly available and can recover from a disaster. It does this by having three data nodes in a multi-master replication configuration, with one node acting as the write leader.

## PGD Configuration

Install PGD on each of the three nodes using the instructions in the Essentials install guide. Specifically:

* [Configure Repositories](/pgd/latest/essential-how-to/install/02-configuring-repositories/) to enable installation of the PGD packages.
* [Install PGD and the Postgres](/pgd/latest/essential-how-to/install/03-installing-pgd/) to install the PGD packages.
* [Configure the PGD Cluster](/pgd/latest/essential-how-to/install/04-configuring-pgd/) to configure the PGD cluster.

## Worked Example

In this example, we will create a three-node cluster with the following nodes:

* The first node is called `node1` and is located on `host-1`.
* The second node is called `node2` and is located on `host-2`.
* The third node is called `node3` and is located on `host-3`.
* the cluster name is `pgd` (the default name).
* The group name is `group1`.
* The Postgres version is `17`.
* The Postgres edition is `essential`.
* The Postgres data directory is `/var/lib/edb-pge/17/main/`.
* The Postgres executable files are in `/usr/edb/pge17/bin/`.
* The Postgres database user is `postgres`.
* The Postgres database port is `5432`.
* The Postgres database name is `bdrdb`.

### For the first node

This is the common setup for all three nodes, installing the software itself.

```bash
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=XXXXXXXXXXXXXX
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN=enterprise
export EDB_REPO_TYPE=rpm
curl -1sSLf " https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN/setup.$EDB_REPO_TYPE.sh" | sudo -E bash
export PG_VERSION=17
export PGD_EDITION=essential
export EDB_PACKAGES="edb-as$PG_VERSION edb-pgd6-$PGD_EDITION-epas$PG_VERSION"
sudo dnf install -y $EDB_PACKAGES
```

On the first node, the following command creates the cluster and the group. It also creates the data directory and initializes the database.

```bash
sudo su - postgres
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/edb/pge17/bin/
pgd node node1 setup "host=host-1 user=postgres port=5432 dbname=bdrdb" --pgdata /var/lib/edb-pge/17/main/ --group-name group1 --cluster-name pgd --create-group --initial-node-count 3
```

### For the second node

Repeat the software installation steps on the second node.

Then run the following command to initialize the node and join the cluster and group.

```bash
sudo su - postgres
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/edb/pge17/bin/
pgd node node2 setup "host=host-2 user=postgres port=5432 dbname=bdrdb" --pgdata /var/lib/edb-pge/17/main/ --cluster-dsn "host=host-1 user=postgres port=5432 dbname=bdrdb"
```

### For the third node

Repeat the software installation steps on the third node.

The command to initialize the node and join the cluster and group is similar to the second node, but with a different host and node name.

```bash
sudo su - postgres
export PATH=$PATH:/usr/edb/pge17/bin/
pgd node node3 setup "host=host-3 user=postgres port=5432 dbname=bdrdb" --pgdata /var/lib/edb-pge/17/main/ --cluster-dsn "host=host-1 user=postgres port=5432 dbname=bdrdb"
```
