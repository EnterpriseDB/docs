## Choosing an architecture

There are two supported architectures for PGD Essential. The architecture you choose will depend on your use case. Essential supports the two major use cases for replication: high availability and disaster recovery. The architecture you choose will depend on your use case.

They are standard and near/far.

## Standard architecture - Ideal for a highly available single location

The standard, or one-location, architecture is designed for a single location that needs to be highly available. Built around three data nodes, the Essential standard architecture ensures that data is replicated across all three nodes and that, in the event of a failure, the system can continue to operate without data loss.

Learn more about the [Standard architecture](standard).

## Near/far architecture - Ideal for disaster recovery

The Near/Far architecture is designed for a single location which needs to be reasonably highly available, and needs to be able to recover from a disaster. It does this by having a two data node cluster in the primary location and a single data node in a secondary location.

Learn more about the [Near/Far architecture](near-far).

!!!Note For multi-region deployments
   For multi-region deployments, geo-distributed architectures are available in [PGD Expanded](/pgd/latest/expanded-how-to/architectures/). These architectures are designed for use cases that require data to be distributed across multiple regions or data centers. They provide advanced features such as conflict resolution, data distribution, and support for large-scale deployments.
   For more information on PGD Expanded, see the [Expanded How-to](/pgd/latest/expanded-how-to).
