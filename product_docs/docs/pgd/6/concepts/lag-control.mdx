title: Lag Control
---

When a node is lagging behind the rest of the cluster, it can cause issues with data consistency and availability. Lag control is a mechanism to manage this situation by ensuring that the lagging node does not disrupt the overall performance of the cluster.

## Lag Control in PGD

When lag is detected in PGD, the Lag Control feature is activated. This feature is designed to manage the lagging node and ensure that it does not disrupt the overall performance of the cluster. It does this by transparently and temporarily slowing client connections, introducing a commit delay to clients. This allows the lagging node to catch up with the rest of the cluster without impacting the performance of the other nodes.
