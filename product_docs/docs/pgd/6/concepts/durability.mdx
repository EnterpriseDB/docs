How does EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) ensure durability of transactions?

Durability can be defined as the guarantee that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain so, even in the event of a system failure. In EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD), durability is achieved through a combination of write-ahead logging (WAL) and replication, in combination with the commit scopes available in the cluster and the configuration of the nodes in the cluster.
