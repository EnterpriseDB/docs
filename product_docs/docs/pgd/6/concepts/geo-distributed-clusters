title: Geo-Distributed Clusters
---

Geo-distributed clusters are a powerful feature of PGD which allow you to create a distributed database system that spans multiple geographic locations. This setup is particularly useful for applications that require high availability, low latency, and disaster recovery across different regions. As this feature needs multiple write nodes and multiple distributed groups, it is only available in PGD Expanded.
