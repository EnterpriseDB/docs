title: Connection Management
---

To ensure that clients can connect to the right nodes in the distributed cluster, EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) provides a connection management system that allows clients to connect to the appropriate nodes based on their needs.

This system is designed to ensure that clients can access the data they need while maintaining the performance and availability of the cluster. 
Unlike Proxy systems, this connection management system is built into the database instance itself, allowing for more efficient and reliable connections.
