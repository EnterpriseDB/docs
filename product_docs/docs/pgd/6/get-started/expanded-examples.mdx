While PGD Essential delivers the core functionality needed to get high availability and/or disaster recover use cases up and running quickly, there are many advanced use cases that can be implemented with PGD Essential. This section provides examples of how to implement some of these advanced use cases.

## Use Cases

### Use Case 1: Multi-Master Replication

By default, PGD Essential uses the PGD Connection Manager to send your requests to the right node. This node is the write leader and by directing your requests there, it allows conflicts to be rapidly resolved.

With PGD Expanded, you can send your requests to any node in the cluster, and PGD will replicate the changes to the other nodes. Configurable conflict management then allows you to choose how to resolve conflicts. 

### Use Case 2: Data Distribution

PGD Expanded allows you to distribute your data across multiple nodes in the cluster, including subscriber-only read-only nodes. These nodes can be located in multiple data centers or availability zones. This allows you to scale your database's read capacity horizontally, adding more nodes to the cluster as needed.

### Use Case 3: Geo-Distribution

PGD Expanded allows you to distribute your data across multiple regions, replicating data to all the nodes in the cluster. Multiple Data groups can be located in different locations to ensure high availability and resilience in that location.

### Use Case 4: Tiered Tables

An optional element of PGD Expanded is the ability to create tiered tables. These tables can be used to tier data between hot data, being replicated within the cluster and cold data being written to a Iceberg/Delta tables data lake. The cold data remains queryable as Tiered Tables uses PGAA which allows you to query the data lake as if it were a table in the database.
