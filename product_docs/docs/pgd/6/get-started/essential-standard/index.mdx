---

The standard architecture is the basic building block for EDB Postgres Distributed. It is most commonly used on a single location where the nodes are in the same data center, and it is also called the one-location architecture. 

## Standard/One-location architecture

The one-location architecture consists of a single PGD cluster with three nodes. The nodes are located in the same data center or availability zone. The nodes are connected to each other using a high-speed network.

The nodes are configured as a data sub-group which means that they replicate data to each other within the same group. In PGD Essential, the group also uses the same write leader node, one node selected by the nodes in the group. The write leader node is responsible for accepting write transactions and replicating them to the other nodes in the group. If the write leade node fails, the other nodes in the group will elect a new write leader node.

Applications can connect to any node in the cluster using PGD's connection manager which runs on every data node. It will automatically route read and write transactions to the write leader. It can also route read only transactions to the other nodes in the group.
