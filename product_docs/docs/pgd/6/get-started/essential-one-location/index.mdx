## About the one-location architecture

The one-location architecture is ideal for a highly available single location. It is the simplest architecture to set up and manage. It is also the most cost-effective architecture for a single location.

You can create a one-location architecture with PGD Essential or PGD Expanded.

## One-location architecture

The one-location architecture consists of a single PGD cluster with three nodes. The nodes are located in the same data center or availability zone. The nodes are connected to each other using a high-speed network.

The nodes are configured in a replication group. The replication group is responsible for replicating data between the nodes. The replication group is also responsible for ensuring that the data is consistent across the nodes.
