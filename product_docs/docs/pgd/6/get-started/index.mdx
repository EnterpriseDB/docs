To begin using any edition of EDB Postgres Distributed, we recommend you first try our local installation and configuration guide. 

This guide will help you install and configure the software, and create your first cluster.

## What is EDB Postgres Distributed?

EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) is a distributed database solution that provides high availability, scalability, and fault tolerance for PostgreSQL databases. It allows you to create clusters of PostgreSQL instances that can work together to provide a single, unified database system.

## What is EDB Postgres Distributed Essential?

EDB Postgres Distributed Essential is a streamlined version of PGD that focuses on delivering core distributed database functionality with minimal complexity. It is designed for users who need basic high availability and disaster recovery features without the advanced capabilities offered by PGD Expanded, the full version.

## What is the PGD Essential Standard architecture

Get to know what EDB Postgres Distributed Essential is all about in [Essential Standard](essential-standard).

## Create your first PGD Essential cluster with Docker Compose

Use the [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) file to [create your first PGD Essential cluster](first-cluster) with three nodes. This is a great way to get started with PGD Essential and see how it works in a real-world scenario and a stepping stone to deploying a production cluster with PGD Essential or PGD Expanded.
