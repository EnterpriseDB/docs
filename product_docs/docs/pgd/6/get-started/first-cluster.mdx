This part of the Getting Started guide will help you create a local cluster using Docker Compose. This is a great way to get familiar with the EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) Essential features and functionality.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your local machine.

## Download the PGD Docker Compose kit

1. Download the Docker kit from the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-distributed).
2. Extract the contents of the downloaded file to a directory on your local machine.
3. Navigate to the extracted directory.
4. Open a terminal window and run the following command to start the Docker containers:

```bash
make up
```

This command will start the Docker containers and create a local cluster with the default configuration.

5. Once the containers are up and running, you can access the PGD cluster using the following command:

```bash
make psql
```

This command will connect you to the primary node of the cluster using the `psql` command-line interface.
