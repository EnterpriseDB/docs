This part of the Getting Started guide will help you create a local cluster using Docker Compose. This is a great way to get familiar with the EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) Essential features and functionality.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your local machine.

## Download the PGD Docker Compose kit

1. Download the PGD Docker Compose file - [docker-compose.yml](/pgd/latest/get-started/assets/docker-compose.yml).
1. Move the downloaded file to a directory where you want to create your local cluster.
1. Run

```bash
docker compose up
```

This command will start the Docker containers and create a local cluster with the default configuration.

1. Once the containers are up and running, you can access the PGD cluster using the following command:

```
docker compose exec host-1 psql pgddb
```

This command will connect you directly to the first node of the cluster using the `psql` command-line interface. This is how you could connect to the database for maintenance and management tasks.

1. You can connect to the write leader node in the cluster using the following command:

```bash
docker compose exec host-1 psql -h host-1 -p 6432 pgddb
```

1. To use the PGD CLI, you can run the following command:

```bash
docker compose exec host-1 pgd nodes list --dsn "host=host-1 port=6432 dbname=pgddb"
__OUTPUT__
 Node Name | Group Name | Node Kind | Join State | Node Status
-----------+------------+-----------+------------+-------------
 node-1    | group-1    | data      | ACTIVE     | Up
 node-2    | group-1    | data      | ACTIVE     | Up
 node-3    | group-1    | data      | ACTIVE     | Up
```

This command will list the nodes in the cluster and their status.
