This part of the Getting Started guide will help you create a local cluster using Docker Compose. This is a great way to get familiar with the EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) Essential features and functionality.

## Prerequisites

- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your local machine.


## Download the PGD Docker Compose kit

[pgd_quickstart.sh](/pgd/latest/get-started/assets/pgd_quickstart.sh) is a script that will download the PGD Docker Compose file and start a local cluster. You can run this script to quickly set up a PGD cluster on your local machine.

1. Download the PGD Docker Compose file - [docker-compose.yml](/pgd/latest/get-started/assets/docker-compose.yml).
1. Move the downloaded file to a directory where you want to create your local cluster.
1. Run

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This command will start the Docker containers and create a local cluster with the default configuration. (You can also use `docker compose up` to run it in the foreground if you want to watch the cluster come up).

## Accessing the PGD Cluster

1. Once the containers are up and running, you can access the PGD cluster using the following command:

```
docker compose exec host-1 psql pgddb
```

This command will connect you directly to the first node of the cluster using the `psql` command-line interface.

This is how you would connect to the database for maintenance and management tasks.

For application and user access you will usually connect using the connection manager which, by default, is running on TCP port 6432 of all the hosts in the cluster.

1. You can connect to the write leader node in the cluster using the following command:

```bash
docker compose exec host-1 psql -h host-1 -p 6432 pgddb
```

You can replace `-h host-1` with the name of any host in the cluster, as they all run the connection manager.

If you have the psql client installed on your local machine, you can also connect to the cluster using the following command:

```bash
export PGPASSWORD=secret
psql -h localhost -p 6432 -U postgres pgddb
```

This connects to the connection manager running on the host-3 container on port 6432. This is then routed to the write leader node in the cluster.

```
pgddb=# select node_name from bdr.local_node_summary;
 node_name
-----------
 node-1
(1 row)
```


1. To use the PGD CLI from outside the containers, you can run the following command:

```bash
docker compose exec host-1 pgd nodes list 
__OUTPUT__
 Node Name | Group Name | Node Kind | Join State | Node Status
-----------+------------+-----------+------------+-------------
 node-1    | group-1    | data      | ACTIVE     | Up
 node-2    | group-1    | data      | ACTIVE     | Up
 node-3    | group-1    | data      | ACTIVE     | Up
```

This pgd command will lists the nodes in the cluster and their status.

You can also get a shell on the host-1 container and run the pgd command directly:

```bash
docker compose exec host-1 bash
pgd nodes list
__OUTPUT__
 Node Name | Group Name | Node Kind | Join State | Node Status
-----------+------------+-----------+------------+-------------
 node-1    | group-1    | data      | ACTIVE     | Up
 node-2    | group-1    | data      | ACTIVE     | Up
 node-3    | group-1    | data      | ACTIVE     | Up
```

This will give you access to the PGD CLI and allow you to run any PGD commands directly on the host-1 container.

## Next Steps

Now that you have created your first PGD cluster, you can explore the following topics:

- [Working with SQL and the cluster](first-steps/working-with-sql) to understand how to connect and interact with the cluster using SQL commands.
- [Loading data](first-steps/loading-data) into the cluster using the `COPY` command or `pg_dump` and `pg_restore`.
- [Using PGD CLI](first-steps/using-cli) to monitor and manage the cluster.
