## What is Connection Manager?

Connection Manager is a new background worker for EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) 6.0 that simplifies the process of connection to PGD clusters by providing a single point of entry for client applications. It replaces the previous proxy solution with an integrated approach that exposes read-write, read-only, and HTTP status network interfaces in PGD.

Connection Manager is fully integrated into PGD and is designed to work seamlessly with the existing PGD architecture.
