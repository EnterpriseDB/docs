DDL stands for data definition language, the subset of the SQL
language that creates, alters, and drops database objects.

## Replicated DDL

For operational convenience and correctness, PGD replicates most DDL
actions, with these exceptions:

-   Temporary relations
-   Certain DDL statements (mostly long running)
-   Locking commands (`LOCK`)
-   Table maintenance commands (`VACUUM`, `ANALYZE`, `CLUSTER`)
-   Actions of autovacuum
-   Operational commands (`CHECKPOINT`, `ALTER SYSTEM`)
-   Actions related to databases or tablespaces

Automatic DDL replication makes 
certain DDL changes easier without having to manually distribute
the DDL change to all nodes and ensure that they're consistent.

In the default replication set, DDL is replicated to all nodes by default.

## Differences from PostgreSQL

PGD is significantly different from standalone PostgreSQL when it
comes to DDL replication. Treating it the same is the most
common issue with PGD.

The main difference from table replication is that DDL replication doesn't
replicate the result of the DDL. Instead, it replicates the statement. This works
very well in most cases, although it introduces the requirement that the DDL
must execute similarly on all nodes. A more subtle point is that the DDL
must be immutable with respect to all datatype-specific parameter settings,
including any datatypes introduced by extensions (not built in).
For example, the DDL statement must execute correctly in the default
encoding used on each node.

## Executing DDL on PGD systems

A PGD group isn't the same as a standalone PostgreSQL server. It's
based on asynchronous multi-master replication without central
locking and without a transaction coordinator. This has important implications
when executing DDL.

DDL that executes in parallel continues to do so with PGD. DDL execution
respects the parameters that affect parallel operation on each node as it
executes, so you might notice differences in the settings between nodes.

Prevent the execution of conflicting DDL, otherwise DDL replication
causes errors and the replication stops.

PGD offers three levels of protection against those problems:

`ddl_locking = 'all'` is the strictest option and is best when DDL might execute
from any node concurrently and you want to ensure correctness. This is the default.

`ddl_locking = 'dml'` is an option that is safe only when you execute
DDL from one node at any time. Use this setting only
if you can completely control where DDL is executed. Executing DDL from a single node
ensures that there are no inter-node conflicts. Intra-node conflicts are already
handled by PostgreSQL.

`ddl_locking = 'off'` is the least strict option and is dangerous in general use.
This option skips locks altogether, avoiding any performance overhead, which makes
it a useful option when creating a new and empty database schema.

These options can be set only by the bdr_superuser, by the superuser, or in the `postgres.conf` configuration file.

When using the [`bdr.replicate_ddl_command`](/pgd/5.9/reference/functions#bdrreplicate_ddl_command), you can set this
parameter directly with the third argument, using the specified
[`bdr.ddl_locking`](/pgd/5.9/reference/pgd-settings#bdrddl_locking) setting only for the DDL commands passed to that
function.

## DDL and mixed PostgreSQL versions

PGD does not support DDL replication between different major Postgres versions in a cluster. Most of the time, this is not an issue because clusters will be running the same major version of Postgres. This is not the case though when performing a rolling upgrade of a cluster from one major version to another. In this case, DDL replication is not supported until all nodes have been upgraded to the same major version and should not be used.

Special care should be taken in the upgrade process when updating extensions as the scripts may trigger DDL replication. In this case, if the scripts must be run before upgrading is complete, `bdr.ddl_replication` setting should be set to `off` while running the script. See the [Rolling upgrade guide](/pgd/5.9/upgrades/upgrading_major_rolling) for more information on how to perform a rolling upgrade of a PGD cluster.
