## Upgrading within version 5

EDB Postgres Distributed uses [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). 
All changes within the same major version are backward compatible, lowering the risk when upgrading and allowing you to choose any later minor or patch release as the upgrade target. 

You can upgrade from any version 5.x release to a later 5.x release. 

## Upgrading from version 4 to version 5

Generally, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version 4 release
before upgrading to the latest version 5 release.
Upgrades from PGD 4 to PGD 5 are supported from version 4.3.0 or later.
Check From version column in below table to know required PGD 4 version
