!!! Note Replication management and DDL
With the exception of `bdr.alter_node_replication_sets`, the following
functions are considered to be `DDL`. DDL replication and global locking
apply to them, if that's currently active. See [DDL replication](../ddl).
!!!

## `bdr.create_replication_set`

This function creates a replication set.

Replication of this command is affected by DDL replication configuration,
including DDL filtering settings.

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.create_replication_set(set_name name,
                           replicate_insert boolean DEFAULT true,
                           replicate_update boolean DEFAULT true,
                           replicate_delete boolean DEFAULT true,
                           replicate_truncate boolean DEFAULT true,
                           autoadd_tables boolean DEFAULT false,
                           autoadd_existing boolean DEFAULT true)
```

### Parameters

-   `set_name` &mdash; Name of the new replication set. Must be unique across the PGD
     group.
-   `replicate_insert` &mdash; Indicates whether to replicate inserts into tables in this
    replication set.
-   `replicate_update` &mdash; Indicates whether to replicate updates of tables in this
    replication set.
-   `replicate_delete` &mdash; Indicates whether to replicate deletes from tables in this
    replication set.
-   `replicate_truncate` &mdash; Indicates whether to replicate truncates of tables in this
    replication set.
-   `autoadd_tables` &mdash; Indicates whether to replicate newly created (future) tables 
    to this replication set
-   `autoadd_existing` &mdash; Indicates whether to add all existing user tables 
    to this replication set. This parameter has an effect only if `autoadd_tables` is
    set to `true`.

### Notes

By default, new replication sets don't replicate DDL or PGD administration
function calls. See [DDL filters](../repsets#ddl-replication-filtering) for how to set
up DDL replication for replication sets. A preexisting DDL filter
is set up for the default group replication set that replicates all DDL and admin
function calls. It's created when the group is created but can be dropped
in case you don't want the PGD group default replication set to replicate
DDL or the PGD administration function calls.

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This means
that the replication is affected by the [DDL filters](../repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration.

The function takes a `DDL` global lock.

This function is transactional. You can roll back the effects with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction. The changes are visible to the current
transaction.

## `bdr.alter_replication_set`

This function modifies the options of an existing replication set.

Replication of this command is affected by DDL replication configuration,
including DDL filtering settings.

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_replication_set(set_name name,
                          replicate_insert boolean DEFAULT NULL,
                          replicate_update boolean DEFAULT NULL,
                          replicate_delete boolean DEFAULT NULL,
                          replicate_truncate boolean DEFAULT NULL,
                          autoadd_tables boolean DEFAULT NULL)
```

### Parameters

-   `set_name` &mdash; Name of an existing replication set.
-   `replicate_insert` &mdash; Indicates whether to replicate inserts into tables in this
    replication set.
-   `replicate_update` &mdash; Indicates whether to replicate updates of tables in this
    replication set.
-   `replicate_delete` &mdash; Indicates whether to replicate deletes from tables in this
    replication set.
-   `replicate_truncate` &mdash; Indicates whether to replicate truncates of tables in this
    replication set.
-   `autoadd_tables` &mdash; Indicates whether to add newly created (future) tables to this replication set.

Any of the options that are set to NULL (the default) remain the same as
before.

### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This means
the replication is affected by the [DDL filters](../repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration.

The function takes a `DDL` global lock.

This function is transactional. You can roll back the effects with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction. The changes are visible to the current
transaction.

## `bdr.drop_replication_set`

This function removes an existing replication set.

Replication of this command is affected by DDL replication configuration,
including DDL filtering settings.

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.drop_replication_set(set_name name)
```

### Parameters

-   `set_name` &mdash; Name of an existing replication set.

### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This means
the replication is affected by the [ddl filters](../repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration.

The function takes a `DDL` global lock.

This function is transactional. You can roll back the effects with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction. The changes are visible to the current
transaction.

!!! Warning
    Don't drop a replication set that's being used by at least
    another node because doing so stops replication on that
    node. If that happens, unsubscribe the affected node
    from that replication set.
    For the same reason, don't drop a replication set with
    a join operation in progress when the node being joined
    is a member of that replication set. Replication set membership is
    checked only at the beginning of the join.
    This happens because the information on replication set usage is
    local to each node, so that you can configure it on a node before
    it joins the group.

You can manage replication set subscriptions for a node using `alter_node_replication_sets`.

## `bdr.alter_node_replication_sets`

This function changes the replication sets a node publishes and is subscribed to.

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_node_replication_sets(node_name name,
                                set_names text[])
```

### Parameters

-   `node_name` &mdash; The node to modify. Currently must be a local node.
-   `set_names` &mdash; Array of replication sets to replicate to the specified
    node. An empty array results in the use of the group default replication set.

### Notes

This function is executed only on the local node and isn't replicated in any manner.

The replication sets listed aren't checked for existence,
since this function is designed to execute before the node joins. Be careful
to specify replication set names correctly to avoid errors.

This behavior allows for calling the function not only on the node that's part of the
PGD group but also on a node that hasn't joined any group yet. This approach limits
the data synchronized during the join. However, the schema is
always fully synchronized without regard to the replication sets setting.
All tables are copied across, not just the ones specified
in the replication set. You can drop unwanted tables by referring to
the `bdr.tables` catalog table. (These might be removed automatically in later
versions of PGD.) This is currently true even if the [DDL filters](../repsets#ddl-replication-filtering)
configuration otherwise prevents replication of DDL.

The replication sets that the node subscribes to after this call are published
by the other nodes for actually replicating the changes from those nodes to
the node where this function is executed.
