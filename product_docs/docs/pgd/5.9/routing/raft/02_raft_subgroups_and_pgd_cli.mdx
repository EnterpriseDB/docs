title: "Working with Raft subgroups and PGD CLI"
---

You can view the status of your nodes and subgroups with the [pgd](../../cli/) CLI command. The examples here assume a cluster as configured in [Creating Raft subgroups with TPA](01_raft_subgroups_and_tpa).

## Viewing nodes with pgd

The pgd command is `show-nodes`.
```shell
pgd nodes list
__OUTPUT__
Node Name Group Name Node Kind Join State Node Status
--------- ---------- --------- ---------- ------------ 
east1     us_east    data       ACTIVE    Up
east2     us_east    data       ACTIVE    Up
east3     us_east    data       ACTIVE    Up
west1     us_west    data       ACTIVE    Up
west2     us_west    data       ACTIVE    Up
west3     us_west    data       ACTIVE    Up
```

## Viewing groups (and subgroups) with pgd

To show the groups in a PGD deployment, along with their names and some attributes, use the PGD CLI command `groups list.`

```
pgd groups list
__OUTPUT__
Group Name Parent Group Name Group Type Nodes
---------- ----------------- ---------- -----  
pgdgroup                     global     0
us_east    pgdgroup          data       3
us_west    pgdgroup          data       3
```
