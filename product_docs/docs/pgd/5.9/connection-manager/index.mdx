PGD 5.9 includes a back-ported version of Connection Manager as an optional feature that is disabled by default. Starting in PGD 6.0, Connection Manager replaces PGD proxy.

Connection Manager in 5.9 allows for seamless upgrades to PGD 6 by having the necessary infrastructure in place. It also gives you the opportunity to test the Connection Manager in non-production environments before a full production upgrade.
