<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.9.1</td><td><details><summary>Fixed node sync bugs</summary><hr/><p>This release has fixed several issues related to node synchronization in BDR.
The node sync process now properly cleans up slots and subscriptions when any of the source, target, or origin parts are involved.
Additionally, the node part operation has been fixed to prevent hanging during node sync operations.
Subscriber-only nodes will also now be correctly synced.</p>
