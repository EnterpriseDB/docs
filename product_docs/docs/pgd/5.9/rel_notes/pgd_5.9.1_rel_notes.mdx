## Bug Fixes

<table class="table w-100"><thead><tr><th>Component</th><th>Version</th><th>Description</th><th width="10%">Addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.9.1</td><td><details><summary>Fixed an issue whereby a connection is silently dropped in the Connection Manager.</summary><hr/><p>The fix improves the handling of authentication failures in the Connection Manager.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.9.1</td><td><details><summary>Fixed an issue whereby Connection Manager crashed when full hostname is used in the <code>pg_hba.conf</code> <code>address</code> field.</summary><hr/><p>The fix also corrects the handling of hostname suffixes. Since hostname matching is not supported by the Connection Manager, HBA rules using hostnames or hostname suffixes are now correctly ignored by the Connection Manager, preventing instability.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.9.1</td><td><details><summary>Improved Connection Manager routing change logic.</summary><hr/><p>Resolved an issue where the Connection Manager dropped existing client connections whenever a write-leader or read-only node routing change occurred. With this fix, client connections are no longer affected by a routing refresh, as long as the PGD node they are currently connected to remains operational.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.9.1</td><td><details><summary>Fixed unexpected subscription and slot creation involving subscriber-only and witness nodes.</summary><hr/><p>Resolved an issue where subscriptions or replication slots were incorrectly created between subscriber-only nodes and witness nodes. This fix prevents the incorrect creation of both subscriptions and replication slots between subscriber-only nodes and witness nodes.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>PGD CLI</td><td>5.9.1</td><td><details><summary>Ensure child origins are cleaned up when a PGD node parts.</summary><hr/><p>Resolved a bug whereby child origins remained on a PGD node after the parting operation was complete.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.9.1</td><td><details><summary>Fixed writer error <code>could not open temporary file</code> after restart.</summary><hr/><p>This issue occurred when streaming a large transaction, and the writer restarted only to find the temporary file name had been incorrectly freed. The bug was introduced with parallel apply and is resolved now.</p>
</details></td><td>53341</td></tr>
<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.9.1</td><td><details><summary>Fixed consensus schema version compatibility issue affecting PGD upgrades.</summary><hr/><p>Resolved a compatibility problem encountered during upgrades from PGD versions previous to 5.6.0 to newer releases. The issue was caused by added fields in the <code>bdr.node_group_routing_info</code> catalog, which caused interoperability failures with <code>pgd-proxy</code> when using the <code>bdr.raft_catalog_read_consistency</code> feature in mixed version clusters.</p>
</details></td><td>51027</td></tr>
<tr><td>PGD CLI</td><td>5.9.1</td><td><details><summary>Backported Connection Manager group options to <code>pgd group</code> commands.</summary><hr/><p>Resolved an issue where Connection Manager options were not included when the it was backported to PGD 5. These options are now backported and available for use with the <code>group get-option</code>, <code>group set-option</code>, and <code>group show</code> commands.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.9.1</td><td><details><summary>Fixed the <code>bdr.msgb_connect</code> hang by introducing a connection timeout.</summary><hr/><p>Resolved an issue where the <code>bdr.msgb_connect</code> function could hang indefinitely due to a missing network timeout setting. The fix adds the a timeout to the function.</p>
</details></td><td>53442</td></tr>
<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.9.1</td><td><details><summary>Connection Manager now starts and responds on its configured ports on all nodes, even those that are not currently part of a node group with routing enabled.</summary><hr/><p>In these cases, the configuration inherited from the top-level node group is automatically applied.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.9.1</td><td><details><summary>Fixed a unique constraint violation error that could occur during an <code>UPDATE</code> operation on tables configured with both primary and unique keys.</summary><hr/><p>Previously, an <code>UPDATE</code> conflict with an <code>update_missing</code> resolution (which attempts to insert a new record) did not check for conflicts against existing primary or unique keys, leading to an error. This issue is now fixed by treating the scenario as an <code>insert_exists</code> conflict and applying the appropriate resolution logic.</p>
