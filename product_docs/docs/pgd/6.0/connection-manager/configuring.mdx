## Configuring Connection Manager

Connection Manager takes its configuration from the PGD Group options for the group the node is a member of.

| read_only_max_server_connections  | maximum read-only connections that will be opened to server, defaults to max_connections                                  |
| read_write_consensus_timeout      | how long to wait on loss of consensus before read-write connections are no longer accepted                                |

## Configuring authentication

Connection Manager is configured through Postgres's own `pg_hba.conf` file.
