You can work around some of the limitations of PGD DDL operation handling.
Often splitting the operation into smaller changes can produce the desired
result that either isn't allowed as a single statement or requires excessive
locking.

## Adding a CONSTRAINT

You can add `CHECK` and `FOREIGN KEY` constraints without requiring a DML lock.
This involves a two-step process:

-   `ALTER TABLE ... ADD CONSTRAINT ... NOT VALID`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... VALIDATE CONSTRAINT`

Execute these steps in two different transactions. Both of these
steps take DDL lock only on the table and hence can be run even when one
or more nodes are down. But to validate a constraint, PGD must
ensure that:
-  All nodes in the cluster see the `ADD CONSTRAINT` command. 
-  The node validating the constraint applied replication changes from all other nodes prior to 
    creating the NOT VALID constraint on those nodes. 

So even though the new mechanism doesn't need all nodes
to be up while validating the constraint, it still requires that all
nodes applied the `ALTER TABLE .. ADD CONSTRAINT ... NOT VALID`
command and made enough progress. PGD waits for a consistent
state to be reached before validating the constraint.

The new facility requires the cluster to run with Raft protocol
version 24 and later. If the Raft protocol isn't yet upgraded, the old
mechanism is used, resulting in a DML lock request.

## Adding a column

To add a column with a volatile default, run these commands in
separate transactions:

```sql
    ALTER TABLE mytable ADD COLUMN newcolumn coltype; -- Note the lack of DEFAULT or NOT NULL

    ALTER TABLE mytable ALTER COLUMN newcolumn DEFAULT volatile-expression;

	BEGIN;
	SELECT bdr.global_lock_table('mytable');
    UPDATE mytable SET newcolumn = default-expression;
	COMMIT;
```

This approach splits schema changes and row changes into separate transactions that
PGD can execute and results in consistent data across all nodes in a
PGD group.

For best results, batch the update into chunks so that you don't update more than
a few tens or hundreds of thousands of rows at once. You can do this using
a `PROCEDURE` with embedded transactions.

The last batch of changes must run in a transaction that
takes a global DML lock on the table. Otherwise you can miss rows
that are inserted concurrently into the table on other nodes.

If required, you can run `ALTER TABLE mytable ALTER COLUMN newcolumn NOT NULL;` after the `UPDATE` has finished.

## Changing a column's type

Changing a column's type can cause PostgreSQL to rewrite a table. In some cases, though, you can avoid this rewriting.
For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE foo (id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY, description VARCHAR(128));
ALTER TABLE foo ALTER COLUMN description TYPE VARCHAR(20);
```

You can rewrite this statement to avoid a table rewrite by making the
restriction a table constraint rather than a datatype change. The constraint can
then be validated in a subsequent command to avoid long locks, if you want.

```sql
CREATE TABLE foo (id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY, description VARCHAR(128));
ALTER TABLE foo
  ALTER COLUMN description TYPE varchar,
  ADD CONSTRAINT description_length_limit CHECK (length(description) <= 20) NOT VALID;
ALTER TABLE foo VALIDATE CONSTRAINT description_length_limit;
```

If the validation fails, then you can `UPDATE` just the failing rows.
You can use this technique for `TEXT` and `VARCHAR` using `length()` or with
`NUMERIC` datatype using `scale()`.

In the general case for changing column type, first add a column of the desired type:

```
ALTER TABLE mytable ADD COLUMN newcolumn newtype;
```

Create a trigger defined as `BEFORE INSERT OR UPDATE ON mytable FOR EACH ROW ..`.
Creating ths trigger assigns `NEW.newcolumn` to `NEW.oldcolumn` so that new writes to the
table update the new column.

`UPDATE` the table in batches to copy the value of `oldcolumn` to
`newcolumn` using a `PROCEDURE` with embedded transactions. Batching the work
helps reduce replication lag if it's a big table. Updating by range of
IDs or whatever method you prefer is fine. Alternatively, you can update the whole table in one pass for
smaller tables.

`CREATE INDEX ...` any required indexes on the new column. It's safe to
use `CREATE INDEX ... CONCURRENTLY` individually without DDL replication
on each node to reduce lock durations.

`ALTER` the column to add a `NOT NULL` and `CHECK` constraints, if required.

1. `BEGIN` a transaction.
1. `DROP` the trigger you added. 
1. `ALTER TABLE` to add any `DEFAULT` required on the column. 
1. `DROP` the old column.
1. `ALTER TABLE mytable RENAME COLUMN newcolumn TO oldcolumn`. 
1. `COMMIT`.

!!! Note 
    Because you're dropping a column, you might have to re-create views, procedures,
    and so on that depend on the table. Be careful if you `CASCADE` drop the column,
    as you must be sure to re-create everything that referred to it.

#### Changing other types

The `ALTER TYPE` statement is replicated, but affected tables aren't locked.

When you use this DDL, ensure that the statement has successfully
executed on all nodes before using the new type. You can achieve this using
the [`bdr.wait_slot_confirm_lsn()`](/pgd/latest/reference/functions#bdrwait_slot_confirm_lsn) function.

This example ensures that the DDL is written to all nodes before using the new value
in DML statements:

```
ALTER TYPE contact_method ADD VALUE 'email';
SELECT bdr.wait_slot_confirm_lsn(NULL, NULL);
```
