## Quick start

This quick start will get you up and running with a fully configured PGD cluster in the Advanced architecture. It uses Docker Compose, which isn't suitable for production use but is valuable for testing functionality and behavior of PGD clusters. You might also find it useful when familiarizing yourself with PGD commands and APIs to prepare for deploying on VMs or Kubernetes.

## Prerequisites

### Docker Engine
### EDB container registry
### etc

## Booting the cluster

```
docker-compose up
```

TODO: Explain what just happened, bootstrap script, etc. Try to use this process to make things look simple.

```
docker-compose ps
```
