## Synopsis

The `pgd commit-scope show` command is used to display information about a commit scope in the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

## Syntax

```plaintext
pgd commit-scope <COMMIT_SCOPE> show [OPTIONS]
```

Where `<COMMIT_SCOPE>` is the name of the commit scope for which you want to display information.

## Options

No command specific options. See [Global Options](/pgd/latest/cli/command_ref/#global-options).

## Example

### Showing a Commit Scope

The following example shows the information about the commit scope `abc1`:

```shell
pgd commit-scope abc1 show
__OUTPUT__
Commit Scope Group Name   Rule Definition
------------ ------------ ---------------------------------------
abc1         dc1_subgroup ANY 2 (dc1_subgroup) SYNCHRONOUS COMMIT
```

The `Group Name` column shows the name of the group to which the commit scope belongs. In this case, the commit scope belongs to the `dc1_subgroup` group.

The `Rule Definition` column shows the rule that defines the commit scope. In this case, the rule is `ANY 2 (dc1) SYCHRONOUS COMMIT`.
The `dc1_subgroup` group is a replicated group, so the commit must be replicated to at least two nodes in the group and any two nodes within it must acknowledge the commit before it is considered committed.
