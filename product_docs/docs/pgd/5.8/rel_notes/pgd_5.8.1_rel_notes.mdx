## Bug Fixes

<table class="table w-100"><thead><tr><th>Component</th><th>Version</th><th>Description</th><th width="10%">Addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>PGD CLI</td><td>5.8.1</td><td><details><summary>Removed the <code>--new-socketdir</code> CLI option and corresponding <code>PGSOCKETDIRNEW</code> env variable for <code>pgd node upgrade</code> command.</summary><hr/><p>The <code>--new-socketdir</code> CLI option and corresponding <code>PGSOCKETDIRNEW</code> env variable was introduced to address a scenario where the old and new socket dirs are different.
This fix addresses the issue by fetching the value of new socket dirs from the initialized new server.</p>
</details></td><td>49024</td></tr>
<tr><td>PGD CLI</td><td>5.8.1</td><td><details><summary>Added a more useful error message if CLI cannot find the executable binaries.</summary><hr/><p>This fixes the command crash if the CLI cannot find the binaries like <code>postgres</code>, <code>pg_ctl</code> on the expected path.
By default it searches the binaries at the path of the <code>pgd</code> binary itself.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.8.1</td><td><details><summary>Ensure that GRANT check for BDR objects works for EPAS object types</summary><hr/><p>The mechanism for determining whether user can be granted permissions
on BDR extension objects was failing for EPAS-specific objects.
This is a regression from PGD release 5.7.0 and is now fixed.</p>

<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.8.1</td><td><details><summary>Ensured physical join does not leave behind a slot that holds WAL.</summary><hr/><p>Physical join using bdr_init_physical resulted in creation of an extra slot
after the physical join is over, and can result in holding up WAL. This is a
regression from BDR release 5.7.0. This is now fixed.</p>

<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.8.1</td><td><details><summary>Fixed node sync bugs</summary><hr/><p>This release has fixed several issues related to node synchronization in BDR.
The node sync process now properly cleans up slots and subscriptions when any of the source, target, or origin parts are involved.
Additionally, the node part operation has been fixed to prevent hanging during node sync operations.
Subscriber-only nodes will also now be correctly synced.</p>
