intro: |
 EDB Postgres Distributed 5.8.0 includes a number of enhancements and bug fixes.
highlights: |
  - PGD CLI improvements enhance usability and functionality.
  - Additional functions simplify sequence management.
  - Includes a fix for CVE-2025-2506.
relnotes:
- relnote: Improved handling of connection information and password obfuscation.
  component: BDR
  details: |
      The shared memory information for connection information may get obfuscated when a password is present
      and become useless. Instead of reading from there, we are now using the `primary_conninfo` GUC
      which is now available on all supported PG versions.
  jira: BDR-5923
  addresses: "41776"
  type: Bug fix
  impact: High

- relnote: We now ensure that commit scope logic only runs on data nodes.
  component: BDR
  details: |
      While commit scope processing does not have any direct affect on
      non-data nodes, by skipping it altogether we can avoid potentially
      confusing error messages.

  type: Enhancement
  impact: Medium

- relnote: Prevent segfault in bdr.taskmgr_set_leader.
  component: BDR
  details: |
      The node_name argument to bdr.taskmgr_set_leader is required. The function now throws an appropriate error in case node_name := NULL is passed in.
  jira: BDR-6401
  addresses: ""
  type: Bug fix
  impact: Medium

- relnote: Added "safety nets" for CDC failover.
  details: |
    CDC failover now has additional safety nets to ensure that the consumer
    does not start replication from a node that is not the creator of the
    replication slot. This is to prevent data loss or duplicate transactions.
    The changes also add additional checks to ensure that the consumer does
    not start replication from a node that does not have the required WAL
    files to decode the transactions that are missing on the consumer but
    were included in the initial snapshot that the newly joined node had
    obtained (physical or logical).

- relnote: Added `bdr.galloc_chunk_info()` function to simplify sequences.
  details: |
    The `bdr.galloc_chunk_info()` function provides information about the chunk
    allocation for a given sequence. This function returns the chunk ID, the
    sequence ID, and the chunk size. This function is useful for debugging and
    understanding how sequences are allocated in BDR.

- relnote: Fixed replication failure with concurrent updates on a non-unique index.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    Updated to compare tuples on lookup to ensure it is the same when handling non-unique indexes.

- relnote: Improved deadlock avoidance where bdr_init_physical and monitoring queries are running concurrently.
  component: BDR
  details: |
      We have replaced TRUNCATEs with DELETEs from all BDR catalogs on a local node drop.
      This is to avoid deadlock in bdr_init_physical if the user happens to run monitoring
      queries during node joining / cleaning unwanted source node data.

- relnote: Ensure a new joiner processes the watermark message in the CATCHUP phase.
  component: BDR
  details: |
      Setting nci->min_lsn to XactLastCommitEnd of watermark message Tx to ensure
      CATCHUP phase finishes on new joiner only after watermark is processed.

- relnote: Improve the CLI debug messages.
  details: |
    Improve the formating of the log messages to be more readable and symmetrical with Postgres log messages.
  component: PGD CLI
  jira:  BDR-6101
  type: Enhancement
  impact: Medium

- relnote: The `--summary` and `--options` flags for `pgd node show` CLI command.
  details: |
    Add the `--summary` and `--options` flags to `pgd node show` command to filter the output of the `pgd node show` command.
    This also maintains symmetry with other `show` commands.

- relnote: More GUCs verfied in `pgd cluster verify` CLI command.
  details: |
    Add the `bdr.lock_table_locking` and `bdr.truncate_locking` GUCs to list of GUCs verfied in `pgd cluster verify` command.
  component: PGD CLI
  jira:  BDR-5308

  type: Enhancement
  impact: High

- relnote: Added a new column for `pgd cluster verify --settings` CLI command output.
  details: |
    Add the `recommended_value` column to the result of the `pgd cluster verify --settings` command.
    The column will not be displayed in tabular output but will be displayed in JSON output.
  component: PGD CLI
  jira:  BDR-5308
  addresses: ""
  type: Enhancement
  impact: Medium

- relnote: Display sorted output for CLI.
  details: |
    The output for the commands with tabular output will be sorted by the resource name.
    For the commands that display more than one resource, the output will be sorted by each resource column in order.
  component: PGD CLI

- relnote: Fixed the CLI `pgd cluster show` command's behavior with clock drift errors and a degraded cluster.
  details: |
    The `pgd cluster show` command would exit with an error regarding clock drift if only one node was up and running in a N node cluster, and not show the associated `health` and `summary` information.
    The command now returns output for, `health` and `summary`, while reporting an appropriate error for `clock-drift`.

- relnote: Fixed the CLI `pgd node show` command crashing if a non-existent node is given.
  details: |
    The `pgd node show` command crashed if a non-existent node was given to the command.
    The command now fails gracefully with an appropriate error message.
  component: PGD CLI

- relnote: Improved pgd_bench error message related to CAMO.
  details: |
    If executed with `--mode=camo`, but the provided test script is not wrapped
    in an explicit transaction, pgd_bench will not be able to retrieve the
    expected `transaction_id` value. Now the emitted error message contains
    a hint about a possible missing transaction.
  component: BDR

  jira: BDR-6411
  type: Enhancement

- relnote: Fixed deadlock issue in bdr_init_physical.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    Fixed deadlock between bdr_init_physical cleaning unwanted node data and concurrent monitoring queries.
  jira: BDR-6313
  addresses: 46952
  type: Bug Fix
  impact: Low
  
- relnote: Fixed a consistency issue in node join where a joining node could possibly miss some data sent to it from the source node.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    Fixed an issue when a new node joining the cluster finishes CATCHUP phase before getting its replication progress against all data nodes. This could have caused a new node to be out of sync with the cluster.

- relnote: Fix Raft leader election timeout/failure after upgrade
  component: BDR
  details: |
     Ensure that any custom value set in the deprecated GUC `bdr.raft_election_timeout`
     is applied to its replacement `bdr.raft_global_election_timeout`.

- relnote: Ensure that disabled subscriptions on subscriber-only nodes are not re-enabled
  component: BDR
  details: |
     During subscription reconfiguration, if there is no change required to a subscription,
     do not enable it since it could have been disabled explicitly by the user.
     Skip reconfiguring subscriptions if there are no leadership changes.

- relnote: Fixed the timestamp parsing issue for `pgd replication show` CLI command.
  details: |
    The `pgd replication show` command previously crashed when formatting EPAS timestamps.

- relnote: Subscriber-only nodes will not take a lock when running DDL
  details: |
    Subscriber-only nodes will no longer attempt to take a lock on the cluster when running DDL. The DDL will be executed locally and not replicated to other nodes.

- relnote: Addressed CVE-2025-2506, which could enable a user with CONNECT access to obtain read access to replicated tables.
  component: BDR
  details: |
    An issue, [CVE-2025-2506](/security/advisories/cve20252506/), was discovered in pglogical which is present in later versions of BDR and PGD. The issue could enable a user with CONNECT access to obtain read access to replicated tables.
  jira: BDR-6274
  addresses: "CVE-2025-2506"
  type: Security
  impact: Highest


- relnote: Reduce lock strength used by the manager process while cleaning up bdr.queue catalog
  details: |
    We were opening the table with ShareRowExclusiveLock, which seems excessively strict for simply deleting old rows from the table. This can result in a deadlock if there are prepared transactions that had inserted into the table, but can't  be resolved by the manager because the manager itself gets blocked on the lock.
