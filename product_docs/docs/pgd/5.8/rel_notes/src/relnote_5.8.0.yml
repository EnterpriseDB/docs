intro: |
 EDB Postgres Distributed 5.8.0 includes a number of enhancements and bug fixes.
highlights: |
  * Simpler sequence management with `bdr.galloc_chunk_info()`
relnotes:
- relnote: Added `bdr.galloc_chunk_info()` function to simplify sequences
  description: |
    The `bdr.galloc_chunk_info()` function provides information about the chunk
    allocation for a given sequence. This function returns the chunk ID, the
    sequence ID, and the chunk size. This function is useful for debugging and
    understanding how sequences are allocated in BDR.

- relnote: Improve pgd_bench error message related to CAMO
  description: |
    If executed with `--mode=camo`, but the provided test script is not wrapped
    in an explicit transaction, pgd_bench will not be able to retrieve the
    expected `transaction_id` value. Improve the emitted error message to
    contain a hint about a possible missing transaction.
