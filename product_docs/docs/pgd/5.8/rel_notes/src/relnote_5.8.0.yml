  - Highlights here
relnotes:
- relnote: Use primary_conninfo GUC instead of trying to read from shared memory
  component: BDR
  details: |
      The shared memory information may get obfuscated and hence become
      useless. So instead of reading from there, simply use the GUC which is
      now available on all supported PG versions.
  jira: BDR-5923
  addresses: "41776"
  type: Bug fix
  impact: High

- relnote: Ensure commit scope logic only runs on data nodes
  component: BDR
  details: |
      While commit scope processing does not have any direct affect on
      non-data nodes, by skipping it altogether we can avoid potentially
      confusing error messages.

- relnote: Prevent segfault in bdr.taskmgr_set_leader
  component: BDR
  details: |
      Add a note in test 00200 to at least give a hint about which
      function may be to blame.
  jira: BDR-6401

- relnote: Add safety nets for CDC failover
  details: |
    CDC failover now has additional safety nets to ensure that the consumer
    does not start replication from a node that is not the creator of the
    replication slot. This is to prevent data loss or duplicate transactions.
    The changes also add additional checks to ensure that the consumer does
    not start replication from a node that does not have the required WAL
    files to decode the transactions that are missing on the consumer but
    were included in the initial snapshot that the newly joined node had
    obtained (physical or logical).

- relnote: Added `bdr.galloc_chunk_info()` function to simplify sequences
  description: |
    The `bdr.galloc_chunk_info()` function provides information about the chunk
    allocation for a given sequence. This function returns the chunk ID, the
    sequence ID, and the chunk size. This function is useful for debugging and
    understanding how sequences are allocated in BDR.

- relnote: Replacing TRUNCATEs with DELETEs from all BDR catalogs on local node drop (#3685)
  component: BDR
  details: |
      This is to avoid deadlock in bdr_init_physical IF customer happens to run monitoring
      queries during node joining / cleaning unwanted source node data.

- relnote: Ensure new joiner processes watermark message in the CATCHUP phase
  component: BDR
  details: |
      Setting nci->min_lsn to XactLastCommitEnd of watermark message Tx to ensure
      CATCHUP phase finishes on new joiner only after watermark is processed.

- relnote: Improve the CLI debug messages.
  details: |
    Improve the formating of the log messages to be more readable and symmetrical with Postgres log messages.
  component: CLI
  jira:  BDR-6101
  type: Enhancement
  impact: Medium

- relnote: The `--summary` and `--options` flags for `pgd node show` CLI command.
  details: |
    Add the `--summary` and `--options` flags to `pgd node show` command to filter the output of the `pgd node show` command.
    This also maintains symmetry with other `show` commands.

- relnote: More GUCs verfied in `pgd cluster verify` CLI command.

- relnote: New column for `pgd cluster verify --settings` CLI command output.
  details: |
    Add the `recommended_value` column to the result of the `pgd cluster verify --settings` command.
    The column will not be displayed in tabular output but will be displayed in JSON output.

- relnote: Display sorted output for CLI.
  details: |
    The output for the commands with tabular output will be sorted by the resource name.
    For the commands that display more than one resource, the output will be sorted by each resource column in order.

- relnote: Fix the CLI `pgd cluster show` command issues on a degraded cluster.
  details: |
    The `pgd cluster show` command failed with error for clock drift if only one node is up and running in a N node cluster.
    The command is fixed to return valid output for other components viz., `health` and `summary` while reporting a valid error for `clock-drift`.
