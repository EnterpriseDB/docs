- relnote: Fix node sync bugs
  component: BDR
  details: |
    This release fixes several issues related to node synchronization in BDR.
    The node sync process now properly cleans up slots and subscriptions when any of the source, target, or origin parts are involved.
    Additionally, the node part has been fixed to prevent hanging during node sync operations.
    Subscriber-only nodes will also now be correctly synced.

- relnote: Remove the `--new-socketdir` CLI option and corresponding `PGSOCKETDIRNEW` env variable for `pgd node upgrade` command.
  details: |
    The `--new-socketdir` CLI option and corresponding `PGSOCKETDIRNEW` env variable was introduced to address a scenario where the old and new socket dirs are different.
    This fix addresses the issue by fetching the value of new socket dirs from the initialized new server.
