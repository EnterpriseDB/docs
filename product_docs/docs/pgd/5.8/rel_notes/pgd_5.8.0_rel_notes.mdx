<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.8.0</td><td><details><summary>Add safety nets for CDC failover</summary><hr/><p>CDC failover now has additional safety nets to ensure that the consumer
does not start replication from a node that is not the creator of the
replication slot. This is to prevent data loss or duplicate transactions.
The changes also add additional checks to ensure that the consumer does
not start replication from a node that does not have the required WAL
files to decode the transactions that are missing on the consumer but
were included in the initial snapshot that the newly joined node had
obtained (physical or logical).</p>
