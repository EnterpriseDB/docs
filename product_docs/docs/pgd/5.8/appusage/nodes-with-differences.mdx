## Replicating between nodes with differences

By default, DDL is sent to all nodes. You can control this behavior, 
as described in [DDL replication](../ddl), and you can use it to create
differences between database schemas across nodes. PGD is designed to allow
replication to continue even with minor differences between nodes. These
features are designed to allow application schema migration without downtime or
to allow logical standby nodes for reporting or testing.

Currently, replication requires the same table name on all nodes. A future
feature might allow a mapping between different table names.

It's possible to replicate between tables with dissimilar partitioning
definitions, such as a source that's a normal table replicating to a partitioned
table, including support for updates that change partitions on the target. It
can be faster if the partitioning definition is the same on the source and
target since dynamic partition routing doesn't need to execute at apply time.
For details, see [Replication sets](../repsets).

By default, all columns are replicated.

PGD replicates data columns based on the column name. If a column has the same
name but a different data type, PGD attempts to cast from the source type to the
target type, if casts were defined that allow that.

PGD supports replicating between tables that have a different number of columns.

If the target has missing columns from the source, then PGD raises a
`target_column_missing` conflict, for which the default conflict resolver is
`ignore_if_null`. This throws an error if a non-NULL value arrives.
Alternatively, you can also configure a node with a conflict resolver of
`ignore`. This setting doesn't throw an error but silently ignores any
additional columns.

If the target has additional columns not seen in the source record, then PGD
raises a `source_column_missing` conflict, for which the default conflict
resolver is `use_default_value`. Replication proceeds if the additional columns
have a default, either NULL (if nullable) or a default expression. If not, it throws an
error and halts replication.

Transform triggers can also be used on tables to provide default values or alter
the incoming data in various ways before apply.

If the source and the target have different constraints, then replication is
attempted, but it might fail if the rows from source can't be applied to the
target. Row filters can help here.

Replicating data from one schema to a more relaxed schema doesn't cause failures.
Replicating data from a schema to a more restrictive schema can be a source of
potential failures. The right way to solve this is to place a constraint on the
more relaxed side, so bad data can't be entered. That way, no bad data ever
arrives by replication, so it never fails the transform into the more
restrictive schema. For example, if one schema has a column of type TEXT and
another schema defines the same column as XML, add a CHECK constraint onto the
TEXT column to enforce that the text is XML.

You can define a table with different indexes on each node. By default, the
index definitions are replicated. To specify how
to create an index on only a subset of nodes or just locally, see [DDL replication](../ddl) .

Storage parameters, such as `fillfactor` and `toast_tuple_target`, can differ
between nodes for a table without problems. An exception to that behavior is that the
value of a table's storage parameter `user_catalog_table` must be identical on
all nodes.

A table being replicated must be owned by the same user/role on each node. See
[Security and roles](../security) for details.

Roles can have different passwords for connection on each node, although by
default changes to roles are replicated to each node. See [DDL
replication](../ddl) to specify how to alter a role password on only a subset of
nodes or locally.

## Comparison between nodes with differences

LiveCompare is a tool for data comparison on a database against PGD and non-PGD
nodes. It needs a minimum of two connections to compare against and reach a
final result.

Starting with LiveCompare 1.3, you can configure with `all_bdr_nodes` set. This setting
saves you from clarifying all the relevant DSNs for each separate node in the
cluster. An EDB Postgres Distributed cluster has N amount of nodes with
connection information, but it's only the initial and output connection that
LiveCompare 1.3 and later needs to complete its job. Setting `logical_replication_mode`
states how all the nodes are communicating.

All the configuration is done in a `.ini` file named `bdrLC.ini`, for example.
Find templates for this configuration file in `/etc/2ndq-livecompare/`.

While LiveCompare executes, you see N+1 progress bars, N being the number of
processes. Once all the tables are sourced, a time displays as the transactions
per second (tps) was measured. This mechanism continues to count the time, giving you an
estimate and then a total execution time at the end.

This tool offers a lot of customization and filters, such as tables, schemas,
and replication_sets. LiveCompare can use stop-start without losing context
information, so it can run at convenient times. After the comparison, a summary
and a DML script are generated so you can review it. Apply the DML to fix any
differences found.

## Replicating between different release levels

The other difference between nodes that you might encounter is where there are
different major versions of PostgreSQL on the nodes. PGD is designed to
replicate between different major release versions. This feature is designed to
allow major version upgrades without downtime.

PGD is also designed to replicate between nodes that have different versions of
PGD software. This feature is designed to allow version upgrades and maintenance
without downtime.

However, while it's possible to join a node with a major version in a cluster,
you can't add a node with a minor version if the cluster uses a newer protocol
version. Doing so returns an error.

Both of these features might be affected by specific restrictions. See [Release
notes](../rel_notes/) for any known incompatibilities.
