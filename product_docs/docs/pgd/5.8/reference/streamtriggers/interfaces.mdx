You can create stream triggers only on tables with `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`
or tables without any columns to which `TOAST` applies.

## `bdr.create_conflict_trigger`

This function creates a new conflict trigger.

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.create_conflict_trigger(trigger_name text,
                            events text[],
                            relation regclass,
                            function regprocedure,
                            args text[] DEFAULT '{}')
```

### Parameters

-   `trigger_name` &mdash; Name of the new trigger.
-   `events` &mdash; Array of events on which to fire this trigger. Valid values are
     '`INSERT`', '`UPDATE`', and '`DELETE`'.
-   `relation` &mdash; Relation to fire this trigger for.
-   `function` &mdash; The function to execute.
-   `args` &mdash; Optional. Specifies the array of parameters the trigger function
     receives on execution (contents of `TG_ARGV` variable).

### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This
means that the replication is affected by the
[ddl filters](../../repsets#ddl-replication-filtering) configuration.

The function takes a global DML lock on the relation on which the trigger
is being created.

This function is transactional. You can roll back the effects with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction. The changes are visible to the current
transaction.

Similar to normal PostgreSQL triggers, the `bdr.create_conflict_trigger`
function requires `TRIGGER` privilege on the `relation` and `EXECUTE`
privilege on the function. This applies with a
`bdr.backwards_compatibility` of 30619 or above. Additional
security rules apply in PGD to all triggers including conflict
triggers. See [Security and roles](../../security/access-control#triggers).

## `bdr.create_transform_trigger`

This function creates a transform trigger.

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.create_transform_trigger(trigger_name text,
                             events text[],
                             relation regclass,
                             function regprocedure,
                             args text[] DEFAULT '{}')
```

### Parameters

-   `trigger_name` &mdash; Name of the new trigger.
-   `events` &mdash; Array of events on which to fire this trigger. Valid values are
     '`INSERT`', '`UPDATE`', and '`DELETE`'.
-   `relation` &mdash; Relation to fire this trigger for.
-   `function` &mdash; The function to execute.
-   `args` &mdash; Optional. Specify array of parameters the trigger function
     receives on execution (contents of `TG_ARGV` variable).

### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This
means that the replication is affected by the
[ddl filters](../../repsets#ddl-replication-filtering) configuration.

The function takes a global DML lock on the relation on which the trigger
is being created.

This function is transactional. You can roll back the effects with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction. The changes are visible to the current
transaction.

Similarly to normal PostgreSQL triggers, the `bdr.create_transform_trigger`
function requires the `TRIGGER` privilege on the `relation` and `EXECUTE`
privilege on the function. Additional security rules apply in PGD to all
triggers including transform triggers. See
[Security and roles](../../security/access-control#triggers).

## `bdr.drop_trigger`

This function removes an existing stream trigger (both conflict and transform).

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.drop_trigger(trigger_name text,
                 relation regclass,
                 ifexists boolean DEFAULT false)
```

### Parameters

-   `trigger_name` &mdash; Name of an existing trigger.
-   `relation` &mdash; The relation the trigger is defined for.
-   `ifexists` &mdash; When set to `true`, this function ignores missing
     triggers.

### Notes

This function uses the same replication mechanism as `DDL` statements. This
means that the replication is affected by the
[ddl filters](../../repsets#ddl-replication-filtering) configuration.

The function takes a global DML lock on the relation on which the trigger
is being created.

This function is transactional. You can roll back the effects with the
`ROLLBACK` of the transaction. The changes are visible to the current
transaction.

Only the owner of the `relation` can execute the `bdr.drop_trigger` function.
