## Comparison

Most options for synchronous replication available to PGD allow for different
levels of synchronization, offering different tradeoffs between performance and
protection against node or network outages.

The following list of [confirmation levels](commit-scope-rules#the-confirmation-level) explains
what a user should expect to see when that confirmation level is in effect and how that can affect performance, durability, and consistency.

### ON RECEIVED

**Expect**: The peer node has received the changes. Nothing has been updated in
the peer nodes tuple store or written to storage.

Confirmation on reception means that the peer operating normally can
eventually, apply the transaction without requiring any further
communication, even in the face of a full or partial network
outage. A crash of a peer node might still require retransmission of
the transaction, as this confirmation doesn't involve persistent
storage. 

**For**: The origin node in the transaction only has to wait for the reception
of the transaction. Where transactions are large, it may improve the TPS
performance of the system.

**Against**: An increased likelihood of stale reads. Overall, ON RECEIVED is not robust
because data can be lost when either a Postgres server or operating system crash
occurs.

### ON REPLICATED

**Expect**: The peer node has received the changes and applied them to the tuple
store. The changes have been written to storage, but the storage has not been flushed
to disk.

Confirmation on replication means the peer has received and applied the changes.
Those changes have been written to storage, but will still be in operating
system caches and buffers. The system has yet to persist them to disk. 

**For**: This checkpoint is further down the timeline of transaction processing.
The origin node only waits for the transaction to be applied, but not persisted.  

**Against**: There's a slightly lower chance of stale reads over ON RECEIVED.
Also, with ON REPLICATED  data can survive a Postgres crash but will still not
survive an operating system crash.

### ON DURABLE

**Expect**: The peer node has received the changes, applied them to the tuple
store and persisted the changes to storage. It has yet to make the changes
available to other sessions.

Durable confirmation means that the transaction has been written and flushed to
the peer node's storage. This protects against loss of data after a
crash and recovery of the peer node. But, if a session commits a transaction
with an ON DURABLE rule before disconnecting and reconnecting, the transaction's
changes are not guaranteed to be visible to the reconnected session.

When used with the Group Commit commit scope kind, this also means the changes
are visible.

**For**: More robust, able to recover without retransmission in the event of a crash.

**Against**: Doesn't guarantee consistency in cases of failover.

### ON VISIBLE

**Expect**: The peer node has received and applied the changes, persisted and flushed those changes to storage. 

Confirmation of visibility means that the transaction was fully applied
remotely. If a session commits a transaction with an ON VISIBLE rule before
disconnecting and reconnecting, the transaction's changes are guaranteed to be
visible to the reconnected session.

**For**: Robust and consistent.

**Against**: Lower performance.
