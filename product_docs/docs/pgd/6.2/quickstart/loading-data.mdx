PGD is, at its core, a Postgres database, so you can use the same tools and methods to load data into your PGD cluster as you would with any PostgreSQL database. To get you started, this guide will walk you through the process of loading data into your PGD cluster.

## Online CSV Importing

First, we are going to show how you can import data from an online CSV file into your PGD cluster. In this case, it's some historical baseball data from [Baseball Databank](https://github.com/cbwinslow/baseballdatabank). We are going to use the `\COPY` command in psql to import directly from a URL. One thing `\COPY` doesn't do is create the table for you, so we will need to create the table first.

Connect to your PGD cluster using `psql`, either using `docker compose exec host-1 psql` or if you have `psql` installed locally, using that to connect to port 6432 on your host machine.

```sql
CREATE TABLE batters (
                      id SERIAL,
                      playerid VARCHAR(9),
                      yearid INTEGER,
                      stint INTEGER,
                      teamid VARCHAR(3),
                      lgid VARCHAR(2),
                      g INTEGER,
                      ab INTEGER,
                      r INTEGER,
                      h INTEGER,
                      "2b" INTEGER,
                      "3b" INTEGER,
                      hr INTEGER,
                      rbi INTEGER,
                      sb INTEGER,
                      cs INTEGER,
                      bb INTEGER,
                      so INTEGER,
                      ibb INTEGER,
                      hbp INTEGER,
                      sh INTEGER,
                      sf INTEGER,
                      gidp INTEGER,
                      PRIMARY KEY (id)
);
```

Now we can import the CSV data into the `batters` table using the `\COPY` command:

```sql
\COPY batters(playerid,yearid,stint,teamid,lgid,g,ab,r,h,"2b","3b",hr,rbi,sb,cs,bb,so,ibb,hbp,sh,sf,gidp) FROM PROGRAM 'curl "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cbwinslow/baseballdatabank/master/core/Batting.csv"' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER
```

This command uses `curl` to fetch the CSV file from the URL and pipes it directly into the `\COPY` command, which imports the data into the `batters` table. The batters(...) entry defines which fields in the row the CSV data should go to. 
The `DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER` options specify that the file is a CSV, using commas, with a header row, that gets skipped.

Copy and the command and paste it into your `psql` session. If everything is set up correctly, you should see the data being imported without any errors. You should see output indicating the number of rows copied, like this:

```console
COPY 110495
```

To verify that the data has been loaded correctly, you can run a simple query:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM batters;
```

You should see a result like this:

```console
 count
-------
 110495
(1 row)
```

This confirms that 110,495 rows have been successfully imported into the `batters` table.

Let's quickly user it to work out who 1998's home run leader was

```sql
SELECT playerid, yearid, teamid, hr
FROM batters
WHERE yearid = 1998
ORDER BY hr DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

You should see output like this:

```console
 playerid  | yearid | teamid | hr
-----------+--------+--------+----
 mcgwima01 |   1998 | SLN    | 70
(1 row)
```

And if we want to put that into the context of the top 5 highest ranked home run hitters in 1998, we can do:

```sql
SELECT playerid, yearid, teamid,
       rank() OVER (PARTITION BY yearid ORDER BY hr desc) hr_rank,
       hr
FROM batters
WHERE yearid = 1998
ORDER BY hr_rank LIMIT 5;
```

You should see output like this:

```console
 playerid  | yearid | teamid | hr_rank | hr
-----------+--------+--------+---------+----
 mcgwima01 |   1998 | SLN    |       1 | 70
 sosasa01  |   1998 | CHN    |       2 | 66
 griffke02 |   1998 | SEA    |       3 | 56
 vaughgr01 |   1998 | SDN    |       4 | 50
 belleal01 |   1998 | CHA    |       5 | 49
(5 rows)
```

With PGD, you can enjoy the full power of PostgreSQL, including advanced SQL features like window functions, to analyze your data, but with the added benefit of it being fully replicated and highly available across multiple nodes even when a node goes offline.
