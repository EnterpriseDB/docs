---

This section provides essential how-to guides for deploying and managing your PGD cluster. It includes information on deployment, durability, autopartition, production best practices, and standard operating procedures (SOPs).

## Overview

PGD Essential offers a simplified approach to deploying and managing your PGD cluster. It is designed to help you get started quickly and easily, while also providing a pathway to using advanced features as your use case becomes more complex.

At the core of PGD are data nodes, Postgres databases that are part of a PGD cluster. PGD enables these databases to replicate data efficiently between nodes, ensuring that your data is always available and up-to-date. PGD Essential simplifies this process by providing a standard architecture that is easy to set up and manage.

The standard architecture is built around a single data group, which is the basic architectural element for EDB Postgres Distributed systems. Within a group, nodes cooperate to select which nodes handle incoming write or read traffic, and identify when nodes are available or out of sync with the rest of the group. Groups are most commonly used on a single location where the nodes are in the same data center and where you have just the one group in the cluster, we also call it the one-location architecture.

## Essential features

- [Connection Management](/pgd/latest/essential-how-to/connections): Learn how to connect to your PGD cluster using the Connection Manager ports, which automatically route read and write transactions to the appropriate nodes.

- [PGD CLI](/pgd/latest/essential-how-to/pgd-cli): Discover how to use the PGD CLI to manage your PGD cluster, including creating and managing data groups, nodes, and connections.

- [Durability](/pgd/latest/essential-how-to/durability): Understand the durability features of PGD Essential, which ensure that your data is always available and up-to-date.

- [Autopartition](/pgd/latest/essential-how-to/autopartition): Learn about the autopartition feature, which automatically partitions your data across nodes in the cluster for improved performance and scalability.
