PGD 6 inherently supports architectures that span multiple locations, such as data centers or availability zones. This is a key feature allows you to build robust and resilient distributed databases that can handle failures and maintain high availability across different geographic locations.

!!! Note 
    This architecture is only available for PGD Expanded.
