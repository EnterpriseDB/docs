## CPU/Core sizing

For production deployments, EDB recommends a minimum of 4 cores for each Postgres data node. Witness nodes don't participate in the data replication operation and don't have to meet this requirement. One core is enough without subgroup Raft. Two cores are enough when using subgroup Raft. 

Always size logical standbys exactly like the data nodes to avoid performance degradations in case of a node promotion. 

We recommend detailed benchmarking of your specific performance requirements to determine appropriate sizing based on your workload. The EDB Professional Services team is available to assist if needed.

For development purposes, don't assign Postgres data nodes fewer than two cores. The sizing of Barman nodes depends on the database size and the data change rate.

You can deploy Postgres data nodes and Barman nodes on virtual machines or in a bare metal deployment mode. However, don't deploy multiple data nodes on VMs that are on the same physical hardware, as that reduces resiliency.
