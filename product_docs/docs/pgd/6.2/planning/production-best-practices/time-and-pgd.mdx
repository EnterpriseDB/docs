## Clocks and timezones

EDB Postgres Distributed is designed to operate with nodes in multiple timezones, allowing a truly worldwide database cluster. Individual servers don't need to be configured with matching timezones, though we do recommend using `log_timezone = UTC` to ensure the human readable server log is more accessible and comparable.

Synchronize server clocks using NTP or other solutions.

Clock synchronization isn't critical to performance, as it is with some other solutions. Clock skew can affect origin conflict detection, though EDB Postgres Distributed provides controls to report and manage any skew that exists. EDB Postgres Distributed also provides row-version conflict detection, as described in [Conflict detection](/pgd/latest/reference/conflict-management/conflicts/).
