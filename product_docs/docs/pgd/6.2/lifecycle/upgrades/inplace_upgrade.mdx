You can upgrade a PGD node to a newer major version of Postgres or a major version of Postgres and PGD using the command-line utility [pgd node upgrade](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/command_ref/node/upgrade.mdx).

!!!Note
In previous versions before 5.7.0, the command used for in-place major version upgrades was `bdr_pg_upgrade`.
However, this command didn't have an option to upgrade both Postgres major versions and PGD versions simultaneously, as `pgd node upgrade` does.
!!!

`pgd node upgrade` is a wrapper around the standard [pg_upgrade](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgupgrade.html) that
adds PGD-specific logic to the process to ensure a smooth upgrade.

## Terminology

This terminology is used when describing the upgrade process and components involved:

*Postgres cluster* &mdash; The database files, both executables and data, that make up a Postgres database instance on a system when run.

*Old Postgres cluster* &mdash; The existing Postgres cluster to upgrade, the one from which to migrate data.

*New Postgres cluster* &mdash; The new Postgres cluster that data is migrated to.
This Postgres cluster must be one major version ahead of the old cluster.

## Precautions

Standard Postgres major version upgrade precautions apply, including the fact both Postgres clusters must meet
all the requirements for [pg_upgrade](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgupgrade.html#id-1.9.5.12.7.).

Additionally, don't use `pgd node upgrade` if other tools are using replication slots and replication origins.
Only PGD slots and origins are restored after the upgrade.

You must meet several prerequisites for `pgd node upgrade`:

- Disconnect applications using the old Postgres cluster. You can, for example,
    redirect them to another node in the PGD cluster.
- Configure peer authentication for both Postgres clusters. `bdr_pg_upgrade`
    requires peer authentication.
- The same or newer version of PGD must be installed on the new cluster.
- The PGD version must be 4.1.0 or later.
- The new cluster must be in a shutdown state.
- You must install PGD packages in the new cluster.
- The new cluster must already be initialized and configured as needed to
    match the old cluster configuration.
- Databases, tables, and other objects must not exist in the new cluster.

!!! Note
When upgrading to PGD 5.7.0+, you don't need to have both clusters run the same PGD version.
The new cluster must be running 5.7.0+.
In that case `pgd node upgrade` will upgrade the PGD version to 5.7.x and upgrade the Postgres major version.
!!!

We also recommend having the old Postgres cluster up prior to running `pgd node upgrade`.
The CLI starts the old Postgres cluster if it's shut down.

## Usage

To upgrade to a newer major version of Postgres or Postgres and PGD, you must first install the new version packages.

### `pgd node upgrade` command-line

`pgd node upgrade` passes all parameters to pg_upgrade.
Therefore, you can specify any parameters supported by [pg_upgrade](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/pgupgrade.html#id-1.9.5.12.6).

#### Synopsis

```plaintext
pgd node <NODE_NAME> upgrade [OPTION] ...
```

#### Options

In addition to the options for pg_upgrade, you can pass the following parameters
to `pgd node upgrade`.

##### Required parameters

Specify these parameters either in the command line or, for all but the `--database` parameter, in their equivalent environment variable. They're used by `pgd node upgrade`.

- `-b, --old-bindir` &mdash; Old Postgres cluster bin directory.
- `-B, --new-bindir`&mdash; New Postgres cluster bin directory.
- `-d, --old-datadir` &mdash; Old Postgres cluster data directory.
- `-D, --new-datadir` &mdash; New Postgres cluster data directory.
- `--database` &mdash; PGD database name.

##### Optional parameters

These parameters are optional and are used by `pgd node upgrade`:

- `-p, --old-port` &mdash; Old cluster port number.
- `-s, --socketdir` &mdash; Directory to use for postmaster sockets during upgrade.
- `--check` &mdash; Specify to only perform checks and not modify clusters.

##### Other parameters

Any other parameter that's not one of the above is passed to pg_upgrade. pg_upgrade accepts the following parameters:

- `-j, --jobs` &mdash; Number of simultaneous processes or threads to use.
- `-k, --link` &mdash; Use hard links instead of copying files to the new cluster.
- `-o, --old-options` &mdash; Option to pass to old postgres command. Multiple invocations are appended.
- `-O, --new-options` &mdash; Option to pass to new postgres command. Multiple invocations are appended.
- `-N, --no-sync` &mdash; Don't wait for all files in the upgraded cluster to be written to disk.
- `-P, --new-port` &mdash; New cluster port number.
- `-r, --retain` &mdash; Retain SQL and log files even after successful completion.
- `-U, --username` &mdash; Cluster's install user name.
- `--clone` &mdash; Use efficient file cloning.

#### Environment variables

You can use these environment variables in place of command-line parameters:

- `PGBINOLD` &mdash; Old Postgres cluster bin directory.
- `PGBINNEW` &mdash; New Postgres cluster bin directory.
- `PGDATAOLD` &mdash; Old Postgres cluster data directory.
- `PGDATANEW` &mdash; New Postgres cluster data directory.
- `PGPORTOLD` &mdash; Old Postgres cluster port number.
- `PGSOCKETDIR` &mdash; Directory to use for postmaster sockets during upgrade.


### Example

Given a scenario where:

- Node name of the cluster you want to upgrade is kaolin.
- Old Postgres cluster bin directory is `/usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin`.
- New Postgres cluster bin directory is `/usr/lib/postgresql/17/bin`.
- Old Postgres cluster data directory is `/var/lib/postgresql/16/main`.
- New Postgres cluster data directory is `/var/lib/postgresql/17/main`.
- Database name is `bdrdb`.


You can use the following command to upgrade the cluster:

```
pgd node kaolin upgrade \
--old-bindir /usr/lib/postgresql/16/bin \
--new-bindir /usr/lib/postgresql/17/bin \
--old-datadir /var/lib/postgresql/16/main \
--new-datadir /var/lib/postgresql/17/main \
--database bdrdb
```

### Steps performed

These steps are performed when running `pgd node upgrade`.

!!! Note
    When `--check` is supplied as an argument to `pgd node upgrade`, the CLI skips steps that modify the database.
