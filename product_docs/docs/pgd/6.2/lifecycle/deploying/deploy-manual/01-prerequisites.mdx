## Provisioning hosts

The first step in the process of deploying PGD is to provision and configure hosts.

You can deploy to virtual machine instances in the cloud with Linux installed, on-premises virtual machines with Linux installed, or on-premises physical hardware, also with Linux installed. 

Whichever [supported Linux operating system](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#bdr) and whichever deployment platform you select, the result of provisioning a machine must be a Linux system that you can access using SSH with a user that has superuser, administrator, or sudo privileges.

Each machine provisioned must be able to make connections to any other machine you're provisioning for your cluster.

On cloud deployments, you can do this over the public network or over a VPC.

On-premises deployments must be able to connect over the local network.

!!! Note Cloud provisioning guides

If you're new to cloud provisioning, these guides may provide assistance:

  Amazon | AWS      | [Tutorial: Get started with Amazon EC2 Linux instances](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/EC2_GetStarted.html)
  Microsoft | Azure | [Quickstart: Create a Linux virtual machine in the Azure portal](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/linux/quick-create-portal?tabs=ubuntu)

### Configuring hosts

#### Create an admin user

We recommend that you configure an admin user for each provisioned instance. 
The admin user must have superuser or `sudo` (to superuser) privileges.
We also recommend that the admin user be configured for passwordless SSH access using certificates. 

#### Ensure networking connectivity

With the admin user created, ensure that each machine can communicate with the other machines you're provisioning.

In particular, the PostgreSQL TCP/IP port (5444 for EDB Postgres Advanced
Server, 5432 for EDB Postgres Extended and community PostgreSQL) must be open
to all machines in the cluster. The PGD Connection Manager must also be 
accessible to all nodes in the cluster. By default, the Connection Manager uses port 6432 (or 6444 for EDB Postgres Advanced Server).

## Worked example

For this series of worked examples, three hosts with Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9 were provisioned:

* host-1
* host-2
* host-3

These hosts were configured in the cloud. As such, each host has both a public and private IP address. We will use the private IP addresses for the cluster.

The private IP addresses are:

- host-1: `192.168.254.166`
- host-2: `192.168.254.247`
- host-3: `192.168.254.135`


For the example cluster, `/etc/hosts` was also edited to use those private IP addresses:

```text
192.168.254.166 host-1
192.168.254.247 host-2
192.168.254.135 host-3
```
