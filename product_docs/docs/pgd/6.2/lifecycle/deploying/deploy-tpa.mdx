description: How to deploy and configure EDB Postgres Distributed using Trusted Postgres Architect (TPA).
---

Trusted Postgres Architect (TPA) is the primary orchestration tool for deploying and managing highly available EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) clusters on self-managed infrastructure. It uses Ansible to automate the installation, configuration, and optimization of the entire PGD stack. It provides additional value, such as compatibility with Oracle using EDB Postgres Advanced Server, Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) using EDB Postgres Extended or Advanced Server".

Refer to the [TPA documentation](/tpa/latest) for instructions on how to deploy a PGD cluster using TPA.
