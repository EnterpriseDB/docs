Many applications require that unique surrogate ids be assigned to database entries.
Often the database `SEQUENCE` object is used to produce these. In
PostgreSQL, these can be either:
-  A manually created sequence using the
`CREATE SEQUENCE` command and retrieved by calling the `nextval()` function
-  `serial` and `bigserial` columns or, alternatively,
`GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY` columns

However, standard sequences in PostgreSQL aren't multi-node aware and
produce values that are unique only on the local node. This is important because
unique ids generated by such sequences cause conflict and data loss by
means of discarded `INSERT` actions in multi-master replication.

!!! Note Permissions required
This means that any user who wants to use sequences
must have at least the [bdr_application](/pgd/latest/reference/security/pgd-predefined-roles#bdr_application) 
role assigned to them.

## PGD global sequences

For this reason, PGD provides an application-transparent way to generate unique
ids using sequences on bigint or bigserial datatypes across the whole PGD group,
called *global sequences*.

PGD global sequences provide an easy way for applications to use the
database to generate unique synthetic keys in an asynchronous distributed
system that works for most&mdash;but not necessarily all&mdash;cases.

Using PGD global sequences allows you to avoid the problems with insert
conflicts. If you define a `PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE` constraint on a column
that's using a global sequence, no node can ever get
the same value as any other node. When PGD synchronizes inserts between the
nodes, they can never conflict.

PGD global sequences extend PostgreSQL sequences, so they are crash-safe. To use
them, you must be granted the bdr_application role.

There are various possible algorithms for global sequences:

-   SnowflakeId sequences
-   Globally allocated range sequences

SnowflakeId sequences generate values using an algorithm that doesn't require
inter-node communication at any point. It's faster and more robust and has the 
useful property of recording the timestamp when the values were
created.

SnowflakeId sequences have the restriction that they work only for 64-bit BIGINT
datatypes and produce values up to 19 digits long. This might be too long for
use in some host language datatypes, such as JavaScript Number types.
Globally allocated sequences allocate a local range of values that can
be replenished as needed by inter-node consensus, making them suitable for
either BIGINT or INTEGER sequences.

You can create a global sequence using the [`bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind()`](/pgd/latest/reference/tables-views-functions/sequences/#bdralter_sequence_set_kind)
function. This function takes a standard PostgreSQL sequence and marks it as
a PGD global sequence. It can also convert the sequence back to the standard
PostgreSQL sequence.

PGD also provides the configuration variable [`bdr.default_sequence_kind`](/pgd/latest/reference/tables-views-functions/pgd-settings/#bdrdefault_sequence_kind). This variable
determines the kind of sequence to create when the `CREATE SEQUENCE`
command is executed or when a `serial`, `bigserial`, or
`GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY` column is created. Valid settings are:

-   `local` &mdash; Newly created
    sequences are the standard PostgreSQL (local) sequences.
-   `galloc` &mdash; Always creates globally allocated range sequences.
-   `snowflakeid` &mdash; Creates global sequences for BIGINT sequences that
     consist of time, nodeid, and counter components. You can't use it with
     INTEGER sequences (so you can use it for `bigserial` but not for `serial`).
-   `timeshard` &mdash; The older version of SnowflakeId sequence. Provided for
    backward compatibility only. The SnowflakeId is preferred.
-   `distributed` (default) &mdash; A special value that you can use only for
     [`bdr.default_sequence_kind`](/pgd/latest/reference/tables-views-functions/pgd-settings/#global-sequence-parameters). It selects `snowflakeid` for `int8`
     sequences (that is, `bigserial`) and `galloc` sequence for `int4`
     (that is, `serial`) and `int2` sequences.

The [`bdr.sequences`](/pgd/latest/reference/tables-views-functions/catalogs-visible/#bdrsequences) view shows information about individual sequence kinds.

The `currval()` and `lastval()` functions work correctly for all types of global sequences.

## Automatic sequence conversion

In PGD 6.0 and later, the act of joining a node to a PGD group or creating a new grou also triggers a conversion of any local sequences into global sequences. Set [`bdr.default_sequence_kind`](/pgd/latest/reference/tables-views-functions/pgd-settings/#bdrdefault_sequence_kind) to `distributed`. This setting then selects the best kind of sequence to convert the local sequences into. If `bdr.default_sequence_kind` is set to `local`, the sequences are left as local sequences. Conversions to `galloc` are performed in a way that ensures that the sequence doesn't conflict with any other sequences in the group.

If you decide to start with local sequences and later switch to galloc sequences, you can do so by setting `bdr.default_sequence_kind` to `galloc` and then running the `bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind()` function on each sequence you want to convert. Be aware, though, that you need to manually set the starting values of the sequences to ensure that they don't conflict with any existing values in the table. See [Converting a local sequence to a galloc sequence](/pgd/latest/reference/sequences#converting-a-local-sequence-to-a-galloc-sequence) for more information about this in general and specifically [How to set a new start value for a sequence](/pgd/latest/reference/sequences#2-set-a-new-start-value-for-the-sequence).

### SnowflakeId sequences

The ids generated by SnowflakeId sequences are loosely time ordered so you can
use them to get the approximate order of data insertion, like standard PostgreSQL
sequences. Values generated within the same millisecond might be out of order,
even on one node. The property of loose time ordering means they're suitable
for use as range-partition keys.

SnowflakeId sequences work on one or more nodes and don't require any inter-node
communication after the node-join process completes. So you can continue to
use them even if there's the risk of extended network partitions. They aren't
affected by replication lag or inter-node latency.

SnowflakeId sequences generate unique ids in a different
way from standard sequences. The algorithm uses three components for a
sequence number. The first component of the sequence is a timestamp
at the time of sequence number generation. The second component of
the sequence number is the unique id assigned to each PGD node,
which ensures that the ids from different nodes are always different. 
The third component is the number generated by
the local sequence.

While adding a unique node id to the sequence number is enough
to ensure there are no conflicts, you also want to keep another useful
property of sequences. The ordering of the sequence
numbers roughly corresponds to the order in which data was inserted
into the table. Putting the timestamp first ensures this.

A few limitations and caveats apply to SnowflakeId sequences.

SnowflakeId sequences are 64 bits wide and need a `bigint` or `bigserial`.
Values generated are up to 19 digits long.
There's no practical 32-bit `integer` version, so you can't use it with `serial`
sequences. Use globally allocated range sequences instead.

For SnowflakeId, there's a limit of 4096 sequence values generated per
millisecond on any given node (about 4 million sequence values per
second). In case the sequence value generation wraps around within a given
millisecond, the SnowflakeId sequence waits until the next millisecond and gets a
fresh value for that millisecond.

Since SnowflakeId sequences encode timestamps into the sequence value, you can generate new sequence
values only within the given time frame (depending on the system clock).
The oldest timestamp that you can use is 2016-10-07, which is the epoch time for
the SnowflakeId. The values wrap to negative values in the year 2086 and
completely run out of numbers by 2156.

Since timestamp is an important part of a SnowflakeId sequence, there's additional
protection from generating sequences with a timestamp older than the latest one
used in the lifetime of a Postgres process (but not between Postgres restarts).

The `INCREMENT` option on a sequence used as input for SnowflakeId sequences is
effectively ignored. This might be relevant for applications that do sequence
ID caching, like many object-relational mapper (ORM) tools, notably Hibernate.
Because the sequence is time based, this has little practical effect since the
sequence advances to a new noncolliding value by the time the
application can do anything with the cached values.

Similarly, you might change the `START`, `MINVALUE`, `MAXVALUE`, and `CACHE` settings
on the underlying sequence, but there's no benefit to doing
so. The sequence's low 14 bits are used and the rest is discarded, so
the value-range limits don't affect the function's result. For the same
reason, `setval()` isn't useful for SnowflakeId sequences.

#### Timeshard sequences

Timeshard sequences are provided for backward compatibility with existing
installations but aren't recommended for new application use. We recommend
using the SnowflakeId sequence instead.

Timeshard is very similar to SnowflakeId but has different limits, fewer
protections, and slower performance.

The differences between timeshard and SnowflakeId are as follows:

- Timeshard can generate up to 16384 per millisecond (about 16 million per
  second), which is more than SnowflakeId. However, there's no protection
  against wraparound within a given millisecond. Schemas using the timeshard
  sequence must protect the use of the `UNIQUE` constraint when using timeshard values
  for a given column.
- The timestamp component of timeshard sequence runs out of values in
  the year 2050 and, if used in combination with bigint, the values wrap
  to negative numbers in the year 2033. This means that sequences generated
  after 2033 have negative values. This is a considerably shorter time
  span than SnowflakeId and is the main reason why SnowflakeId is preferred.
- Timeshard sequences require occasional disk writes (similar to standard local
  sequences). SnowflakeIds are calculated in memory so the SnowflakeId
  sequences are in general a little faster than timeshard sequences.

### Unlogged sequences and PGD

Since Postgres 15, it has been possible to create unlogged sequences. These are
related and similar to unlogged tables, which aren't written to the WAL and aren't replicated.
In the context of PGD and unlogged sequences, it isn't a sensible configuration to have an unlogged
PGD sequence and it could cause unexpected problems in the event of a node failure. Therefore, we prevent the creation of unlogged PGD sequences or the conversion of a PGD sequence to an unlogged sequence.

### Globally allocated range sequences

The globally allocated range (or `galloc`) sequences allocate ranges (chunks)
of values to each node. When the local range is used up, a new range is
allocated globally by consensus among the other nodes. This behavior uses the key
space efficiently but requires that the local node be connected to a majority
of the nodes in the cluster for the sequence generator to progress when the
currently assigned local range is used up.

Unlike SnowflakeId sequences, `galloc` sequences support all sequence data types
provided by PostgreSQL: `smallint`, `integer`, and `bigint`. This means that
you can use `galloc` sequences in environments where 64-bit sequences are
problematic. Examples include using integers in JavaScript, since that supports only
53-bit values, or when the sequence is displayed on output with limited space.

The range assigned by each voting node is currently predetermined based on the
datatype the sequence is using:

-   smallint &mdash; 1 000 numbers
-   integer &mdash; 1 000 000 numbers
-   bigint &mdash; 1 000 000 000 numbers

Each node allocates two chunks of seq_chunk_size&mdash;one for the current use
plus a reserved chunk for future use&mdash;so the values generated from any one
node increase monotonically. However, viewed globally, the values
generated aren't ordered at all. This might cause a loss of performance
due to the effects on b-tree indexes and typically means that generated
values aren't useful as range-partition keys.

The main downside of the `galloc` sequences is that, once the assigned range is
used up, the sequence generator has to ask for consensus about the next range
for the local node that requires inter-node communication. This might
lead to delays or operational issues if the majority of the PGD group isn't
accessible. (This might be avoided in later releases.)

The `CACHE`, `START`, `MINVALUE`, and `MAXVALUE` options work correctly
with `galloc` sequences. However, you need to set them before transforming
the sequence to the `galloc` kind. The `INCREMENT BY` option also works
correctly. However, you can't assign an increment value that's equal
to or more than the above ranges assigned for each sequence datatype.
`setval()` doesn't reset the global state for `galloc` sequences. Don't use it.

PGD tracks `galloc` sequences in the `bdr.sequence_alloc` catalog to manage currently allocated chunks. While Raft manages chunk allocation, changes to a sequence's name or namespace are traditionally handled via the replication stream.

Starting with PGD 6.2, renaming a `galloc` sequence or its containing schema is fully supported. This is enabled by a global UUID identifier (`sequuid`) in the `bdr.sequence_kind` catalog, which allows PGD to track the sequence consistently even if its name or namespace changes. For earlier versions, these operations remain unsupported.

See [ALTER SEQUENCE](ddl/ddl-command-handling/#alter-sequence) for more details on managing these objects.

#### Converting a local sequence to a galloc sequence

Before transforming a local sequence to galloc, you need to take care of several
prerequisites.

##### 1. Verify that sequence and column data type match

Check that the sequence's data type matches the datatype of the column with
which it will be used. For example, you can create a `bigint` sequence
and assign an `integer` column's default to the `nextval()` returned by that
sequence. With galloc sequences, which for `bigint` are allocated in blocks of
1 000 000 000, this quickly results in the values returned by `nextval()`
exceeding the `int4` range if more than two nodes are in use.

This example shows what can happen:

```sql
CREATE SEQUENCE int8_seq;

SELECT sequencename, data_type FROM pg_sequences;
 sequencename | data_type
--------------+-----------
 int8_seq     | bigint
(1 row)

CREATE TABLE seqtest (id INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY);

ALTER SEQUENCE int8_seq OWNED BY seqtest.id;

SELECT bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind('public.int8_seq'::regclass, 'galloc', 1);
 alter_sequence_set_kind
-------------------------

(1 row)

ALTER TABLE seqtest ALTER COLUMN id SET DEFAULT nextval('int8_seq'::regclass);
```

After executing `INSERT INTO seqtest VALUES(DEFAULT)` on two nodes, the table
contains the following values:

```sql
SELECT * FROM seqtest;
     id
------------
          2
 2000000002
(2 rows)
```

However, attempting the same operation on a third node fails with an
`integer out of range` error, as the sequence generated the value
`4000000002`.

!!! Tip
    You can retrieve the current data type of a sequence from the PostgreSQL
    [pg_sequences](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/view-pg-sequences.html)
    view. You can modify the data type of a sequence with `ALTER SEQUENCE ... AS ...`,
    for example, `ALTER SEQUENCE public.sequence AS integer`, as long as its current
    value doesn't exceed the maximum value of the new data type.

##### 2. Set a new start value for the sequence

When the sequence kind is altered to `galloc`, it's rewritten and restarts from
the defined start value of the local sequence. If this happens on an existing
sequence in a production database, you need to query the current value and
then set the start value appropriately. To help with this use case, PGD
lets you pass a starting value with the function [`bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind()`](/pgd/latest/reference/tables-views-functions/sequences#bdralter_sequence_set_kind).
If you're already using offset and you have writes from multiple nodes, you
need to check what's the greatest used value and restart the sequence to at least
the next value:

```sql
-- determine highest sequence value across all nodes
SELECT max((x->'response'->'command_tuples'->0->>'nextval')::bigint)
    FROM jsonb_array_elements(
        bdr.run_on_all_nodes(
            E'SELECT nextval(\'public.sequence\');'
            )::jsonb) AS x;

-- turn into a galloc sequence
SELECT bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind('public.sequence'::regclass, 'galloc', $MAX + $MARGIN);
```

Since users can't lock a sequence, you must leave a `$MARGIN` value to allow
operations to continue while the `max()` value is queried.

The [`bdr.sequence_alloc`](/pgd/latest/reference/tables-views-functions/catalogs-visible/#bdrsequence_alloc) table gives information on the chunk size and the
ranges allocated around the whole cluster.

In this example, the sequence starts at `333`, and the cluster has two nodes. 
The number of allocation is 4, which is 2 per node,
and the chunk size is 1000000, which is related to an integer sequence.

```sql
SELECT * FROM bdr.sequence_alloc
    WHERE seqid = 'public.categories_category_seq'::regclass;
          seqid          | seq_chunk_size | seq_allocated_up_to | seq_nallocs |       seq_last_alloc
-------------------------+----------------+---------------------+-------------+-----------------------------
 categories_category_seq |        1000000 |             4000333 |           4 | 2020-05-21 20:02:15.957835+00
(1 row)
```


To see the ranges currently assigned to a given sequence on each node, execute the function
[`bdr.galloc_chunk_info`](/pgd/latest/reference/tables-views-functions/sequences#bdrgalloc_chunk_info).

* Node `Node1` is using range from `333` to `2000333`.

```sql
SELECT * FROM bdr.galloc_chunk_info('categories_category_seq');
 chunk_start | chunk_end
-------------+-----------
         334 |   1000333
     1000334 |   2000333
(2 rows)
```

* Node `Node2` is using range from `2000334` to `4000333`.

```sql

SELECT * FROM bdr.galloc_chunk_info('categories_category_seq');
 chunk_start | chunk_end
-------------+-----------
     2000334 |   3000333
     3000334 |   4000333
```

When a node finishes a chunk, it asks a consensus for a new one and gets the
first available. In the example, it's from 4000334 to 5000333. This is
the new reserved chunk and starts to consume the old reserved chunk.

## UUIDs, KSUUIDs, and other approaches

You can generate globally unique ids in other ways without using the global
sequences that can be used with PGD. For example:

- UUIDs and their PGD variant, KSUUIDs
- Local sequences with a different offset per node (i.e., manual)
- An externally coordinated natural key

PGD applications can't use other methods safely. Counter-table-based approaches relying on `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`, `UPDATE ... RETURNING ...` or similar for sequence generation don't work correctly in PGD because PGD doesn't take row locks between nodes. The same values are generated on more than one node. For the same reason, the usual strategies for "gapless" sequence generation don't work with PGD. In most cases, the application coordinates generating sequences that must be gapless from some external source using two-phase commit. Or it generates them only on one node in the PGD group.

## KSUUID v2 functions

PGD applications can't use other methods safely.

### UUIDs

`UUID` keys instead avoid sequences entirely and
use 128-bit universal unique identifiers. These are random
or pseudorandom values that are so large that it's nearly
impossible for the same value to be generated twice. There's
no need for nodes to have continuous communication when using `UUID` keys.

In the unlikely event of a collision, conflict detection
chooses the newer of the two inserted records to retain. Conflict logging,
if enabled, records such an event. However, it's
exceptionally unlikely to ever occur, since collisions
become practically likely only after about 2^64 keys are generated.

The main downside of `UUID` keys is that they're somewhat inefficient in terms of space and
the network. They consume more space not only as a primary key but
also where referenced in foreign keys and when transmitted on the wire.
Also, not all applications cope well with `UUID` keys.

### KSUUIDs

PGD provides functions for working with a K-sortable variant of `UUID` data.
Known as KSUUID, it generates values that can be stored using the PostgreSQL
standard `UUID` data type. A `KSUUID` value is similar to `UUIDv1` in that
it stores both timestamp and random data, following the `UUID` standard.
The difference is that `KSUUID` is K-sortable, meaning that it's weakly
sortable by timestamp. This makes it more useful as a database key, as it
produces more compact `btree` indexes. This behavior improves
the effectiveness of search and allows natural time-sorting of result data.
Unlike `UUIDv1`,
`KSUUID` values don't include the MAC of the computer on which they were
generated, so there are no security concerns from using them.

We now recommend `KSUUID` v2 in all cases. You can directly sort values generated 
with regular comparison operators.

There are two versions of `KSUUID` in PGD: v1 and v2.
The legacy `KSUUID` v1 is
deprecated but is kept to support existing installations. Don't
use it for new installations.
The internal contents of v1 and v2 aren't compatible. As such, the
functions to manipulate them also aren't compatible. The v2 of `KSUUID` also
no longer stores the `UUID` version number.

See [KSUUID v2 functions](/pgd/latest/reference/tables-views-functions/sequences/#ksuuid-v2-functions) and [KSUUID v1 functions](/pgd/latest/reference/tables-views-functions/sequences/#ksuuid-v1-functions) in the PGD reference.

### Step and offset sequences

In offset-step sequences, a normal PostgreSQL sequence is used on each node.
Each sequence increments by the same amount and starts at differing offsets.
For example, with step 1000, node1's sequence generates 1001, 2001, 3001, and
so on. node2's sequence generates 1002, 2002, 3002, and so on. This scheme works well
even if the nodes can't communicate for extended periods. However, the designer
must specify a maximum number of nodes when establishing the
schema, and it requires per-node configuration. Mistakes can easily lead to
overlapping sequences.

It's relatively simple to configure this approach with PGD by creating the
desired sequence on one node, like this:

```
CREATE TABLE some_table (
    generated_value bigint primary key
);

CREATE SEQUENCE some_seq INCREMENT 1000 OWNED BY some_table.generated_value;

ALTER TABLE some_table ALTER COLUMN generated_value SET DEFAULT nextval('some_seq');
```

Then, on each node calling `setval()`, give each node a different offset
starting value, for example:

```
-- On node 1
SELECT setval('some_seq', 1);

-- On node 2
SELECT setval('some_seq', 2);

 -- ... etc
```

Be sure to allow a large enough `INCREMENT` to leave room for all
the nodes you might ever want to add, since changing it in the future is difficult
and disruptive.

If you use `bigint` values, there's no practical concern about key exhaustion,
even if you use offsets of 10000 or more. It would take hundreds of years,
with hundreds of machines, doing millions of inserts per second, to have any
chance of approaching exhaustion.

PGD doesn't currently offer any automation for configuring the
per-node offsets on such step/offset sequences.

#### Composite keys

A variant on step/offset sequences is to use a composite key composed of
`PRIMARY KEY (node_number, generated_value)`. The
node number is usually obtained from a function that returns a different
number on each node. You can create such a function by temporarily
disabling DDL replication and creating a constant SQL function. Alternatively, you can use
a one-row table that isn't part of a replication set to store a different
value in each node.
