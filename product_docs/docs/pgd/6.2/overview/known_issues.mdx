## Known issues

These are currently known issues in EDB Postgres Distributed {{version.full}}.
These known issues are tracked in PGD's ticketing system and are expected to be resolved in a future release.

-   Replication of materialized views only works with newly-created materialized views.  Materialized views that were created before 
    upgrading to {{version.full}}.0 do not get replicated after upgrading. To prevent this issue, you can do one of the following:

    -   Before upgrading to PGD {{version.full}}.0., manually create the materialized view on each node.
        -   OR 
    -   After upgrading to PGD {{version.full}}.0., drop and create the materialized view so that it gets replicated.


-   If the resolver for the `update_origin_change` conflict
      is set to `skip`, `synchronous_commit=remote_apply` is used, and
      concurrent updates of the same row are repeatedly applied on two
      different nodes, then one of the update statements might hang due
      to a deadlock with the PGD writer. As mentioned in
      [Conflicts](/pgd/latest/reference/conflict-management/conflicts/), `skip` isn't the default
      resolver for the `update_origin_change` conflict, and this
      combination isn't intended to be used in production. It discards
      one of the two conflicting updates based on the order of arrival
      on that node, which is likely to cause a divergent cluster.
      In the rare situation that you do choose to use the `skip`
      conflict resolver, note the issue with the use of the
      `remote_apply` mode.

-   The Decoding Worker feature doesn't work with CAMO/Eager/Group Commit.
    Installations using CAMO/Eager/Group Commit must keep `enable_wal_decoder` disabled.

-   Lag Control doesn't adjust commit delay in any way on a fully isolated node, that's in case all other nodes are unreachable or not operational. 
    As soon as at least one node connects, replication Lag Control picks up its work and adjusts the PGD commit delay again.

-   For time-based Lag Control, PGD currently uses the lag time, measured by commit timestamps, rather than the estimated catch up time that's based on historic apply rates.

-   Changing the CAMO partners in a CAMO pair isn't currently possible.
    It's possible only to add or remove a pair.
    Adding or removing a pair doesn't require a restart of Postgres or even a reload of the configuration.

-   Group Commit can't be combined with [CAMO](/pgd/latest/reference/commit-scopes/camo/). 

-   Transactions using Eager Replication can't yet execute DDL. The TRUNCATE command is allowed.

-   Parallel Apply isn't currently supported in combination with Group Commit. Make sure to disable it when using Group Commit by either (a) Setting `num_writers` to 1 for the node group using [`bdr.alter_node_group_option`](/pgd/latest/reference/tables-views-functions/nodes-management-interfaces/#bdralter_node_group_option) or (b) using the GUC [`bdr.writers_per_subscription`](/pgd/latest/reference/tables-views-functions/pgd-settings#bdrwriters_per_subscription). See [Configuration of generic replication](/pgd/latest/reference/tables-views-functions/pgd-settings#generic-replication).

-   There currently is no protection against altering or removing a commit scope. 
    Running transactions in a commit scope that's concurrently being altered or removed can lead to the transaction blocking or replication stalling completely due to an error on the downstream node attempting to apply the transaction.
    Make sure that any transactions using a specific commit scope have finished before altering or removing it.

-   The [PGD CLI](/pgd/latest/reference/cli) can return stale data on the state of the cluster if it's still connecting to nodes that were previously parted from the cluster. 
    Edit the [`pgd-cli-config.yml`](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/configuring_cli/#using-a-configuration-file) file, or change your [`--dsn`](/pgd/latest/reference/cli/configuring_cli/#using-database-connection-strings-in-the-command-line) settings to ensure only active nodes in the cluster are listed for connection.

To modify a commit scope safely, use [`bdr.alter_commit_scope`](/pgd/latest/reference/tables-views-functions/functions#bdralter_commit_scope).

-   DDL run in serializable transactions can face the error: `ERROR: could not serialize access due to read/write dependencies among transactions`. A workaround is to run the DDL outside serializable transactions.

-   The EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17 data type [`BFILE`](/epas/latest/reference/sql_reference/02_data_types/03a_bfiles/) is not currently supported. This is due to `BFILE` being a file reference that is stored in the database, and the file itself is stored outside the database and not replicated.

## Limitations

Take these EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) design limitations into account when planning your deployment.

### Nodes

-   PGD can run hundreds of nodes, assuming adequate hardware and network. However,
    for mesh-based deployments, we generally don’t recommend running more than 48
    nodes in one cluster. If you need extra read scalability beyond the 48-node
    limit, you can add subscriber-only nodes without adding connections to the
    mesh network.

-   The minimum recommended number of nodes in a group is three to provide fault
    tolerance for PGD's consensus mechanism. With just two nodes, consensus would
    fail if one of the nodes were unresponsive. Consensus is required for some PGD
    operations, such as distributed sequence generation. For more information about
    the consensus mechanism used by EDB Postgres Distributed, see [Architectural
    details](/pgd/latest/reference/overview/basic-architecture/).

### Multiple databases on single instances

Support for using PGD for multiple databases on the same Postgres instance is
**deprecated** beginning with PGD 5 and will no longer be supported with PGD 6. As
we extend the capabilities of the product, the added complexity introduced
operationally and functionally is no longer viable in a multi-database design.

It's best practice and we recommend that you configure only one database per PGD instance. 

The tooling such as the CLI and Connection Manager currently codify that recommendation. 

While it's still possible to host up to 10 databases in a single instance,
doing so incurs many immediate risks and current limitations:

-   If PGD configuration changes are needed, you must execute administrative commands 
    for each database. Doing so increases the risk for potential
    inconsistencies and errors.

-   You must monitor each database separately, adding overhead.

-   Connection Manager works at the Postgres instance level, not at the database level,
    meaning the leader node is the same for all databases.

-   Each additional database increases the resource requirements on the server.
    Each one needs its own set of worker processes maintaining replication, for example,
    logical workers, WAL senders, and WAL receivers. Each one also needs its own
    set of connections to other instances in the replication cluster. These needs might
    severely impact performance of all databases.

-   Synchronous replication methods, for example, CAMO and Group Commit, won’t work as
    expected. Since the Postgres WAL is shared between the databases, a
    synchronous commit confirmation can come from any database, not necessarily in
    the right order of commits.

-   CLI integration assumes one database. 

### Durability options (Group Commit/CAMO)

There are various limits on how the PGD durability options work. 
These limitations are a product of the interactions between Group Commit and CAMO, and how they interact with PGD features such as the [WAL decoder](/pgd/latest/reference/decoding_worker/) and  [transaction streaming](/pgd/latest/reference/transaction-streaming/).

Also, there are limitations on interoperability with legacy synchronous replication,
interoperability with explicit two-phase commit, and unsupported combinations
within commit scope rules. 

The following limitations apply to the use of commit scopes and the various durability options they enable.

#### General durability limitations

-   [Legacy synchronous replication](/pgd/latest/reference/commit-scopes/legacy-sync) uses a mechanism for transaction confirmation
    different from the one used by CAMO, Eager, and Group Commit. The two aren't
    compatible, so don't use them together. Whenever you use Group Commit, CAMO,
    or Eager, make sure none of the PGD nodes are configured in
    `synchronous_standby_names`.

-   Postgres two-phase commit (2PC) transactions (that is, [`PREPARE
    TRANSACTION`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare-transaction.html))
    can't be used with CAMO, Group Commit, or Eager because those
    features use two-phase commit underneath.

#### Group Commit

[Group Commit](/pgd/latest/reference/commit-scopes/group-commit) enables configurable synchronous commits over 
nodes in a group. If you use this feature, take the following limitations into account:

-   Not all DDL can run when you use Group Commit. If you use unsupported DDL, a warning is logged, and the transactions commit scope is set to local. The only supported DDL operations are:
    -   Nonconcurrent `CREATE INDEX`
    -   Nonconcurrent `DROP INDEX`
    -   Nonconcurrent `REINDEX` of an individual table or index
    -   `CLUSTER` (of a single relation or index only)
    -   `ANALYZE`
    -   `TRUNCATE`


-   Explicit two-phase commit isn't supported by Group Commit as it already uses two-phase commit.

-   Combining different commit decision options in the same transaction or
    combining different conflict resolution options in the same transaction isn't
    supported.

-   Currently, Raft commit decisions are extremely slow, producing very low TPS.
    We recommended using them only with the `eager` conflict resolution setting
    to get the Eager All-Node Replication behavior of PGD 4 and older.

#### Eager

[Eager](/pgd/latest/reference/commit-scopes/group-commit/#eager-conflict-resolution) is available through Group Commit. It avoids conflicts by eagerly aborting transactions that might clash. It's subject to the same limitations as Group Commit. 

Eager doesn't allow the `NOTIFY` SQL command or the `pg_notify()` function. It
also doesn't allow `LISTEN` or `UNLISTEN`.

## CAMO

[Commit At Most Once](/pgd/latest/reference/commit-scopes/camo) (CAMO) is a feature that aims to prevent
applications committing more than once. If you use this feature, take 
these limitations into account when planning:

-   CAMO is designed to query the results of a recently failed COMMIT on the
    origin node. In case of disconnection, the application must request the
    transaction status from the CAMO partner. Ensure that you have as little delay
    as possible after the failure before requesting the status. Applications must
    not rely on CAMO decisions being stored for longer than 15 minutes.

-   If the application forgets the global identifier assigned, for example,
    as a result of a restart, there's no easy way to recover
    it. Therefore, we recommend that applications wait for outstanding
    transactions to end before shutting down.

-   For the client to apply proper checks, a transaction protected by CAMO
    can't be a single statement with implicit transaction control. You also can't
    use CAMO with a transaction-controlling procedure or
    in a `DO` block that tries to start or end transactions.

-   CAMO resolves commit status but doesn't resolve pending
    notifications on commit. CAMO doesn't
    allow the `NOTIFY` SQL command or the `pg_notify()` function.
    They also don't allow `LISTEN` or `UNLISTEN`.

-   When replaying changes, CAMO transactions might detect conflicts just
    the same as other transactions. If timestamp-conflict detection is used,
    the CAMO transaction uses the timestamp of the prepare-on-the-origin
    node, which is before the transaction becomes visible on the origin
    node itself.

-   CAMO isn't currently compatible with transaction streaming.
    Be sure to disable transaction streaming when planning to use
    CAMO. You can configure this option globally or in the PGD node group. See
    [Transaction streaming configuration](/pgd/latest/reference/transaction-streaming#configuration).

-   CAMO isn't currently compatible with decoding worker.
    Be sure to not enable decoding worker when planning to use
    CAMO. You can configure this option in the PGD node group. See
    [Decoding worker disabling](/pgd/latest/reference/decoding_worker#enabling).

-   Not all DDL can run when you use CAMO. If you use unsupported DDL, a warning is logged and the transactions commit scope is set to local only. The only supported DDL operations are:
    -   Nonconcurrent `CREATE INDEX`
    -   Nonconcurrent `DROP INDEX`
    -   Nonconcurrent `REINDEX` of an individual table or index
    -   `CLUSTER` (of a single relation or index only)
    -   `ANALYZE`
    -   `TRUNCATE`


-   Explicit two-phase commit isn't supported by CAMO as it already uses two-phase commit.

-   You can combine only CAMO transactions with the `DEGRADE TO` clause for
    switching to asynchronous operation in case of lowered availability.

### Mixed PGD versions

PGD was developed to [enable rolling upgrades of PGD](/pgd/latest/upgrades/) by allowing mixed versions of PGD to operate during the upgrade process. 
We expect users to run mixed versions only during upgrades and, once an upgrade starts, that they complete that upgrade.
We don't support running mixed versions of PGD except during an upgrade.

### Other limitations

This noncomprehensive list includes other limitations that are expected and
are by design. We don't expect to resolve them in the future. 
Consider these limitations when planning your deployment:

-   A `galloc` sequence might skip some chunks if you create the sequence in a
    rolled back transaction and then create it again with the same name. Skipping chunks can
    also occur if you create and drop the sequence when DDL replication isn't active
    and then you create it again when DDL replication is active. The impact of
    the problem is mild because the sequence guarantees aren't violated. The
    sequence skips only some initial chunks. Also, as a workaround, you can
    specify the starting value for the sequence as an argument to the
    `bdr.alter_sequence_set_kind()` function.
