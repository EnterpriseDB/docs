## Architectural options and performance

### Always-on architectures

A number of different architectures can be configured, each of which has different performance and scalability characteristics.

The group is the basic building block consisting of 2+ nodes (servers). In a group, each node is in a different availability zone, with a dedicated router and backup, giving immediate switchover and high availability. Each group has a dedicated replication set defined on it. If the group loses a node, you can easily repair or replace it by copying an existing node from the group.

The Always-on architectures are built from either one group in a single location or two groups in two separate locations. Each group provides high availability. When two groups are leveraged in remote locations, they together also provide disaster recovery (DR).

Tables are created across both groups, so any change goes to all nodes, not just to nodes in the local group.

One node in each group is selected as the group's write leader. Proxies then direct application writes and queries to the write leader. The other nodes are replicas of the write leader. If, at any point, the write leader is seen to be unavailable, the remaining nodes in the group select a new write leader from the group and the proxies direct traffic to that node. Scalability isn't the goal of this architecture.

Since writes are mainly to only one node, the possibility of contention between nodes is reduced to almost zero. As a result, performance impact is much reduced.

Secondary applications might execute against the shadow nodes, although these are reduced or interrupted if the main application begins using that node.

In the future, one node will be elected as the main replicator to other groups, limiting CPU overhead of replication as the cluster grows and minimizing the bandwidth to other groups.

### Supported Postgres database servers

PGD is compatible with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [EDB Postgres Extended Server](/pge/latest), and [EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest) and is deployed as a standard Postgres extension named BDR. See [Compatibility](/pgd/latest/compatibility) for details about supported version combinations.

Some key PGD features depend on certain core capabilities being available in the target Postgres database server. Therefore, PGD users must also adopt the Postgres database server distribution that's best suited to their business needs. For example, if having the PGD feature Commit At Most Once (CAMO) is mission critical to your use case, don't adopt the community PostgreSQL distribution. It doesn't have the core capability required to handle CAMO. 

PGD offers close-to-native Postgres compatibility. However, some access patterns don't necessarily work as well in multi-node setup as they do on a single instance. There are also some limitations in what you can safely replicate in a multi-node setting. [Application usage](/pgd/latest/appusage) goes into detail about how PGD behaves from an application development perspective.

### Characteristics affecting performance

By default, PGD keeps one copy of each table on each node in the group, and any changes propagate to all nodes in the group.

Since copies of data are everywhere, SELECTs need only ever access the local node. On a read-only cluster, performance on any one node isn't affected by the number of nodes and is immune to replication conflicts on other nodes caused by long-running SELECT queries. Thus, adding nodes increases linearly the total possible SELECT throughput.

If an INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE (DML) is performed locally, then the changes propagate to all nodes in the group. The overhead of DML apply is less than the original execution. So if you run a pure write workload on multiple nodes concurrently, a multi-node cluster can handle more TPS than a single node.

Conflict handling has a cost that acts to reduce the throughput. The throughput then depends on how much contention the application displays in practice. Applications with very low contention perform better than a single node. Applications with high contention can perform worse than a single node. These results are consistent with any multimaster technology and aren't particular to PGD.

Synchronous replication options can send changes concurrently to multiple nodes so that the replication lag is minimized. Adding more nodes means using more CPU for replication, so peak TPS reduces slightly as each node is added.

If the workload tries to use all CPU resources, then this resource constrains replication, which can then affect the replication lag.

In summary, adding more master nodes to a PGD group doesn't result in significant write throughput increase when most tables are replicated because all the writes are replayed on all nodes. Because PGD writes are in general more effective than writes coming from Postgres clients by way of SQL, you can increase performance. Read throughput generally scales linearly with the number of nodes.
