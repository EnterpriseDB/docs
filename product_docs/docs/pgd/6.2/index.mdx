Welcome to the PGD {{version.full}} documentation. PGD {{version.full}} is available in two editions: Essential and Expanded.

## Why PGD?

Modern data architectures require an extensible approach to data management, whether the requirement is for high availability, disaster recovery or multi-region data distribution. PGD is designed to meet these needs, and in PGD 6 we have made it easier to get started with PGD, while also providing a pathway to using advanced features as your use case becomes more complex.

## What does PGD enable?

PGD enables you to build a distributed database architecture that can span multiple regions, data centers, or cloud providers. It provides multi-master replication and data distribution. Postgres databases can be deployed into data groups within the cluster and data within each node can be distributed across multiple nodes.

## What are the differences between PGD Essential and PGD Expanded?

PGD Expanded is the full-featured version of PGD. It includes all the features of PGD Essential, as well as additional features such as advanced conflict management, data distribution, and support for large-scale deployments. PGD Expanded is designed for users who need the most advanced features and capabilities of PGD.

PGD Essential is a simplified version of PGD Expanded. It is designed for users who want to get started with PGD quickly and easily, without the need for advanced features or complex configurations. PGD Essential includes the core features of PGD but enables them in a way that makes replication and availability simple. It therefore does not include some of the more advanced features available in PGD Expanded.

PGD Essential limits the number of data nodes in a cluster to four and the number of groups to two. It also limits the number of nodes in a group to four. PGD Expanded does not have these limitations.
