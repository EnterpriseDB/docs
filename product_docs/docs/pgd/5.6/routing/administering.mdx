## Switching the write leader

Switching the write leader is a manual operation that you can perform to change the node that's the write leader. 
It can be useful when you want to perform maintenance on the current write leader node or when you want to change the write leader for any other reason.
When changing write leader, there are two modes: `strict` and `fast`. 
In `strict` mode, the lag is checked before switching the write leader. It waits until the lag is less than `route_writer_max_lag` before starting the switchover. This is the default.
In `fast` mode, the write leader is switched immediately.
You can also set a timeout parameter to specify the time to wait for the switchover to complete.

!!!Note

The switchover operation is not a guaranteed operation. If, due to a timeout or for other reasons, the switchover to the given target node fails, PGD may elect another node as write leader in its place. This other node can include the current write leader node. PGD always tries to elect a new write leader if the switchover operation fails.

### Using SQL

You can perform a switchover operation that explicitly changes the node that's
the write leader to another node.

Use the [`bdr.routing_leadership_transfer()`](/pgd/latest/reference/routing#bdrrouting_leadership_transfer) function.

For example, to switch the write leader to node `node1` in group `group1`, use the following SQL command:

```sql
SELECT bdr.routing_leadership_transfer('group1', 'node1','strict','10s');
```

This command switches the write leader using `strict` mode and waits for up to 10 seconds for the switchover to complete. Those are default settings, so you can omit them, as follows:

```sql
SELECT bdr.routing_leadership_transfer('group1', 'node1');
```

### Using PGD CLI

You can use the [`pgd group set leader`](/pgd/latest/cli/command_ref/pgd_group_set_leader/) command to perform a switchover operation.

For example, to switch the write leader from node `node1` to node `node2` in group `group1`, use the following command:

```sh
pgd group set leader  --group-name group1 --node-name node1 --method strict --timeout 10s
```

This command switches the write leader using `strict` mode and waits for up to 10 seconds for the switchover to complete. Those are default settings, so you can omit them, as follows:

```sh
pgd group set leader --group-name group1 --node-name node1
```
