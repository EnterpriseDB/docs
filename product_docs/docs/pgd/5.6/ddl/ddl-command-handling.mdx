The following table describes the utility or DDL commands that are allowed, the ones that
are replicated, and the type of global lock they take when they're replicated.

For some more complex statements like `ALTER TABLE`, these can differ depending
on the subcommands executed. Every such command has detailed explanation
under the following table.

## Command Notes
<div id='bdr_ddl_allowed_AlterSeqStmt'></div>

### ALTER SEQUENCE

Generally `ALTER SEQUENCE` is supported, but when using global
sequences, some options have no effect.

`ALTER SEQUENCE ... RENAME` isn't supported on galloc sequences (only).
`ALTER SEQUENCE ... SET SCHEMA` isn't supported on galloc sequences (only).

### ALTER TABLE

Generally, `ALTER TABLE` commands are allowed. However, several
subcommands aren't supported.

<div id='bdr_ddl_allowed_AlterTableStmt'></div>

#### ALTER TABLE disallowed commands

Some variants of `ALTER TABLE` currently aren't allowed on a PGD node:

-   `ADD COLUMN ... DEFAULT (non-immutable expression)` &mdash; This is not allowed because
    it currently results in different data on different nodes. See
    [Adding a column](ddl-workarounds/#adding-a-column) for a suggested workaround.
-   `ADD CONSTRAINT ... EXCLUDE` &mdash; Exclusion constraints are not
    supported. Exclusion constraints are a way to ensure that no two rows in a
    table have overlapping ranges. This is useful in a synchronous system where
    you can ensure that the constraint is enforced on all nodes at the same
    time. But in an asynchronous system, you can't ensure that the constraint is
    enforced on all nodes at the same time. This can lead to data inconsistency
    and changes that can't be replayed; therefore, exclusion constraints aren't
    supported.
-   `ALTER TABLE ... SET WITH[OUT] OIDS` &mdash; Isn't supported for the same reasons
    as in `CREATE TABLE`.
-   `ALTER COLUMN ... SET STORAGE external` &mdash; Is rejected if the column is
    one of the columns of the replica identity for the table.
-   `RENAME` &mdash; Can't rename an Autopartitioned table.
-   `SET SCHEMA` &mdash; Can't set the schema of an Autopartitioned table.
-   `ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE` &mdash; Changing a column's type isn't supported if the
    command causes the whole table to be rewritten, which occurs when the change
    isn't binary coercible.
    Binary coercible changes might be allowed only one way. For example,
    the change from `VARCHAR(128)` to `VARCHAR(256)` is binary coercible and therefore
    allowed, whereas the change `VARCHAR(256)` to `VARCHAR(128)` isn't binary coercible
    and therefore normally disallowed. Nonreplicated `ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE`,
    can be allowed if the column is automatically castable to the new type
    (it doesn't contain the `USING` clause). An example follows.
    Table rewrites hold an
    AccessExclusiveLock for extended periods on larger tables, so such commands
    are likely to be infeasible on highly available databases in any case.
    See [Changing a column's type](ddl-workarounds/#changing-a-columns-type) for a suggested workaround.
-   `ALTER TABLE ... ADD FOREIGN KEY` &mdash; Isn't supported if current user doesn't have
    permission to read the referenced table or if the referenced table
    has RLS restrictions enabled that the current user can't bypass.

The following example fails because it tries to add a constant value of type `timestamp`
onto a column of type `timestamptz`. The cast between `timestamp` and `timestamptz`
relies on the time zone of the session and so isn't immutable.

```sql
ALTER TABLE foo
  ADD expiry_date timestamptz DEFAULT timestamp '2100-01-01 00:00:00' NOT NULL;
```

Starting in PGD 3.7.4, you can add certain types of constraints, such as `CHECK` and
`FOREIGN KEY` constraints, without taking a DML lock. But
this requires a two-step process of first creating a `NOT VALID` constraint
and then validating the constraint in a separate transaction with the `ALTER TABLE ... VALIDATE CONSTRAINT` 
command. See [Adding a CONSTRAINT](ddl-workarounds#adding-a-constraint)
for more details.

<div id='bdr_ddl_lock_relation_AlterTableStmt'></div>

#### ALTER TABLE locking

The following variants of `ALTER TABLE` take only DDL lock and not a
DML lock:

-   `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ... (immutable) DEFAULT`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET DEFAULT expression`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... DROP DEFAULT`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... TYPE` if it doesn't require rewrite
-   `ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET STATISTICS`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... VALIDATE CONSTRAINT`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... ATTACH PARTITION`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... DETACH PARTITION`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE TRIGGER` (`ENABLE REPLICA TRIGGER` still takes a DML lock)
-   `ALTER TABLE ... CLUSTER ON`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... SET WITHOUT CLUSTER`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... SET ( storage_parameter = value [, ... ] )`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... RESET ( storage_parameter = [, ... ] )`
-   `ALTER TABLE ... OWNER TO`

All other variants of `ALTER TABLE` take a DML lock on the table being modified.
Some variants of `ALTER TABLE` have restrictions, noted below.

#### ALTER TABLE examples

This next example works because the type change is binary coercible and so doesn't
cause a table rewrite. It executes as a catalog-only change.

```sql
CREATE TABLE foo (id BIGINT PRIMARY KEY, description VARCHAR(20));
ALTER TABLE foo ALTER COLUMN description TYPE VARCHAR(128);
```

However, making this change to reverse the command isn't possible because
the change from `VARCHAR(128)` to `VARCHAR(20)` isn't binary coercible.

```sql
ALTER TABLE foo ALTER COLUMN description TYPE VARCHAR(20);
```

For workarounds, see [Restricted DDL workarounds](ddl-workarounds).

It's useful to provide context for different types of `ALTER TABLE ...
ALTER COLUMN TYPE` (ATCT) operations that are possible in general and in
nonreplicated environments.

Some ATCT operations update only the metadata of the underlying column
type and don't require a rewrite of the underlying table data. This is
typically the case when the existing column type and the target type are
binary coercible. For example:

```sql
CREATE TABLE sample (col1 BIGINT PRIMARY KEY, col2 VARCHAR(128), col3 INT);
ALTER TABLE sample ALTER COLUMN col2 TYPE VARCHAR(256);
```

You can also change the column type to `VARCHAR` or `TEXT`
data types because of binary coercibility. Again, this is just a metadata
update of the underlying column type.

```sql
ALTER TABLE sample ALTER COLUMN col2 TYPE VARCHAR;
ALTER TABLE sample ALTER COLUMN col2 TYPE TEXT;
```

However, if you want to reduce the size of col2, then that leads to
a rewrite of the underlying table data. Rewrite of a table is normally
restricted.

```sql
ALTER TABLE sample ALTER COLUMN col2 TYPE VARCHAR(64);
ERROR:  ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN TYPE that rewrites table data may not affect replicated tables on a PGD node
```

To give an example with nontext types, consider col3 above with type
INTEGER. An ATCT operation that tries to convert to SMALLINT or BIGINT 
fails in a similar manner as above.

```sql
ALTER TABLE sample ALTER COLUMN col3 TYPE bigint;
ERROR:  ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN TYPE that rewrites table data may not affect replicated tables on a PGD node
```

In both of these failing cases, there's an automatic assignment
cast from the current types to the target types. However, there's no
binary coercibility, which ends up causing a rewrite of the underlying
table data.

In such cases, in controlled DBA environments, you can change
the type of a column to an automatically castable one by adopting
a rolling upgrade for the type of this column in a nonreplicated
environment on all the nodes, one by one. Suppose the DDL isn't replicated
and the change of the column type is to an automatically castable one. 
You can then allow the rewrite locally on the node
performing the alter, along with concurrent activity on other nodes on
this same table. You can then repeat this nonreplicated ATCT operation
on all the nodes one by one to bring about the desired change of the
column type across the entire EDB Postgres Distributed cluster. Because this
involves a rewrite, the activity still takes the DML lock for a
brief period and thus requires that the whole cluster is available. With
these specifics in place, you can carry out the rolling upgrade of the nonreplicated
alter activity like this:

```sql
-- foreach node in EDB Postgres Distributed cluster do:
SET bdr.ddl_replication TO FALSE;
ALTER TABLE sample ALTER COLUMN col2 TYPE VARCHAR(64);
ALTER TABLE sample ALTER COLUMN col3 TYPE BIGINT;
RESET bdr.ddl_replication;
-- done
```

Due to automatic assignment casts being available for many data types,
this local nonreplicated ATCT operation supports a wide variety of
conversions. Also, ATCT operations that use a `USING` clause
are likely to fail because of the lack of automatic assignment casts.
This example shows a few common conversions with automatic assignment casts:

```sql
-- foreach node in EDB Postgres Distributed cluster do:
SET bdr.ddl_replication TO FALSE;
ATCT operations to-from {INTEGER, SMALLINT, BIGINT}
ATCT operations to-from {CHAR(n), VARCHAR(n), VARCHAR, TEXT}
ATCT operations from numeric types to text types
RESET bdr.ddl_replication;
-- done
```

This example isn't an exhaustive list of possibly allowable ATCT
operations in a nonreplicated environment. Not all ATCT
operations work. The cases where no automatic assignment is
possible fail even if you disable DDL replication. So, while
conversion from numeric types to text types works in a nonreplicated
environment, conversion back from text type to numeric types fails.

```sql
SET bdr.ddl_replication TO FALSE;
-- conversion from BIGINT to TEXT works
ALTER TABLE sample ALTER COLUMN col3 TYPE TEXT;
-- conversion from TEXT back to BIGINT fails
ALTER TABLE sample ALTER COLUMN col3 TYPE BIGINT;
ERROR:  ALTER TABLE ... ALTER COLUMN TYPE which cannot be automatically cast to new type may not affect replicated tables on a PGD node
RESET bdr.ddl_replication;
```

While the ATCT operations in nonreplicated environments support a
variety of type conversions, the rewrite
can still fail if the underlying table data contains values that you can't
assign to the new data type. For example, suppose the current type for
a column is `VARCHAR(256)` and you try a nonreplicated ATCT
operation to convert it into `VARCHAR(128)`. If there's any existing data
in the table that's wider than 128 bytes, then the rewrite operation
fails locally.

```sql
INSERT INTO sample VALUES (1, repeat('a', 200), 10);
SET bdr.ddl_replication TO FALSE;
ALTER TABLE sample ALTER COLUMN col2 TYPE VARCHAR(128);
INFO:  in rewrite
ERROR:  value too long for type character varying(128)
```

If underlying table data meets the characteristics of the new type,
then the rewrite succeeds. However,
replication might fail if other nodes that haven't yet performed the
nonreplicated rolling data type upgrade introduce new data that
is wider than 128 bytes concurrently to this local ATCT operation. This
brings replication to a halt in the cluster. So 
be aware of the data type restrictions and characteristics at the
database and application levels while performing these
nonreplicated rolling data type upgrade operations. We strongly
recommend that you perform and test such ATCT operations in
controlled and fully aware DBA environments. These
ATCT operations are asymmetric, and backing out certain changes that fail
can lead to table rewrites that take a long time.

Also, you can't perform the implicit castable ALTER activity in transaction blocks.

### ALTER TYPE

`ALTER TYPE` is replicated, but a global DML lock isn't
applied to all tables that use that data type, since PostgreSQL doesn't
record those dependencies. See [Restricted DDL workarounds](ddl-workarounds).

<div id='bdr_ddl_can_replicate_comment'></div>

### COMMENT ON

All variants of `COMMENT ON` are allowed, but
`COMMENT ON TABLESPACE/DATABASE/LARGE OBJECT` isn't replicated.

<div id='bdr_ddl_allowed_CreateSeqStmt'></div>

### CREATE PROFILE or ALTER PROFILE

The `PASSWORD_VERIFY_FUNCTION` associated with the profile should be `IMMUTABLE` if the function is `SECURITY DEFINER`.
Such a `CREATE PROFILE` or `ALTER PROFILE` command will be replicated but subsequent `CREATE USER` or `ALTER USER` commands using this profile will
break the replication due to the `writer` worker throwing the error: `cannot change current role within security-restricted operation`.

<div id='bdr_ddl_allowed_CreateAlterProfile'></div>

### CREATE SEQUENCE

Generally `CREATE SEQUENCE` is supported, but when using global
sequences, some options have no effect.

<div id='bdr_ddl_allowed_CreateStmt'></div>

### CREATE TABLE

Generally `CREATE TABLE` is supported, but `CREATE TABLE WITH OIDS` isn't
allowed on a PGD node.

<div id='bdr_ddl_allowed_CreateTableAsStmt'></div>

### CREATE TABLE AS and SELECT INTO

`CREATE TABLE AS` and `SELECT INTO` are allowed only if all subcommands are
also allowed.

### EXPLAIN

Generally `EXPLAIN` is allowed, but because `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` can have side
effects on the database, there are some restrictions on it.

<div id='bdr_ddl_can_replicate_explain'></div>

#### EXPLAIN ANALYZE Replication

`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` follows replication rules of the analyzed statement.

<div id='bdr_ddl_lock_explain_stmt'></div>

#### EXPLAIN ANALYZE Locking

`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` follows locking rules of the analyzed statement.

<div id='bdr_ddl_can_replicate_grant'></div>

### GRANT and REVOKE

Generally `GRANT` and `REVOKE` statements are supported, however
`GRANT/REVOKE ON TABLESPACE/LARGE OBJECT` aren't replicated.

<div id='bdr_ddl_lock_lock_stmt'></div>

### LOCK TABLE

LOCK TABLE isn't replicated, but it might acquire the global DML lock when
`bdr.lock_table_locking` is set `on`.

You can also use The `bdr.global_lock_table()` function to explicitly request a global DML
lock.

<div id='bdr_ddl_can_replicate_seclabel'></div>

### SECURITY LABEL

All variants of `SECURITY LABEL` are allowed, but
`SECURITY LABEL ON TABLESPACE/DATABASE/LARGE OBJECT` isn't replicated.

<div id='bdr_ddl_can_replicate_truncate'></div>

### TRUNCATE Replication

`TRUNCATE` command is replicated as DML, not as a DDL statement. Whether
the `TRUNCATE` on table is replicated depends on replication settings for
each affected table.

<div id='bdr_ddl_lock_truncate_stmt'></div>

### TRUNCATE Locking

Even though `TRUNCATE` isn't replicated the same way as other DDL, it can acquire
the global DML lock when `bdr.truncate_locking` is set to `on`.
