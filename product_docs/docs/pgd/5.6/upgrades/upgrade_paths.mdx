## Upgrading within version 5

You can upgrade from any version 5.x release to a later 5.x release. 

## Upgrading from version 4 to version 5

Upgrades from PGD 4 to PGD 5 are supported from version 4.3.0. For earlier
versions, upgrade to 4.3.0 before upgrading to 5. See [Upgrading within
4](/pgd/4/upgrades/upgrade_paths/#upgrading-within-version-4) for more
information. 

Generally, we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version 4
release before upgrading to the latest version 5 release. After upgrading to
4.3.0 or later, the following upgrade paths are possible.

| From version | To version |
| ---- | -- |
| 4.3.0 | 5.0.0 or later |
| 4.3.1 | 5.1.0 or later |
| 4.3.2 | 5.1.0 or later |
| 4.3.3 | 5.1.0 or later |

## Upgrading from version 3.7 to version 5

Starting with version 3.7.23, you can upgrade directly to version 5.3.0 or later. 
For earlier versions, upgrade to 3.7.23 before upgrading to 5. 
See [Upgrading within version 3.7](/pgd/3.7/bdr/upgrades/supported_paths/#upgrading-within-version-37) 
for more information.
