intro: |
 EDB Postgres Distributed 5.6.0 includes a number of enhancements and bug fixes.
highlights: |
  - Improved observability with new monitoring functions and SQL views.
  - Improvements to commit scopes including:
     - GROUP COMMIT and SYNCHRONOUS COMMIT support graceful degrading using DEGRADE ON.
     - ORIGIN_GROUP support and commit scope inheritance simplify commit scope creation.
     - Improved synchronous commit behavior around deadlocks.
     - Metrics for commit scope performance and state.
  - Optimized Topology support for Subscriber-only groups and nodes. (preview)
  - Improved Postgres compliance with support for:
      - Exclusion Constraints
      - REINDEX replications
      - createrole_self_grant
      - column reference in DEFAULT expressions
      - CREATE SCHEMA AUTHORIZATION
  - Streaming Transaction support with Decoding Worker.
relnotes:
- relnote: Decoding Worker supports Streaming Transactions
  component: BDR
  component_version: 5.6.0
  details: |
    One of the main advantages of streaming is that the WAL sender sends the partial transaction before it commits, which reduces replication lag. Now, with streaming support, the WAL decoder does the same thing, but it streams to the LCRs segments. Eventually, the WAL sender will read the LCRs and mimic the same behavior of streaming large transactions before they commit. This provides the benefits of decoding worker, such as reduced CPU and disk space, as well as the benefits of streaming, such as reduced lag and disk space, since ".spill" files are not generated.
    The WAL decoder always streams the transaction to LCRs, but based on downstream requests, the WAL sender either streams the transaction or just mimics the normal BEGIN..COMMIT scenario.
    In addition to the normal LCRs segment files, we create streaming files with the starting names `TR_TXN_<file-name-format>` and `CAS_TXN_<file-name-format>` for each streamed transaction.

- relnote: Introduce several new monitoring views
  component: BDR
  component_version: 5.6.0
  details: |
   There are several view providing new information as well as making some
   existing information easier to discover:
    - [`bdr.stat_commit_scope`](/pgd/5.6/reference/catalogs-visible#bdrstat_commit_scope) : Cumulative statistics for commit scopes.
    - [`bdr.stat_commit_scope_state`](/pgd/5.6/reference/catalogs-visible#bdrstat_commit_scope_state) : Information about current use of commit scopes by backends.
    - [`bdr.stat_receiver`](/pgd/5.6/reference/catalogs-visible#bdrstat_receiver) : Per subscription receiver statistics.
    - [`bdr.stat_writer`](/pgd/5.6/reference/catalogs-visible#bdrstat_writer) : Per writer statistics. There can be multiple writers for each subscription. This also includes additional information about the currently applied transaction.
    - [`bdr.stat_raft_state`](/pgd/5.6/reference/catalogs-visible#bdrstat_raft_state) : The state of the Raft consensus on the local node.
    - [`bdr.stat_raft_followers_state`](/pgd/5.6/reference/catalogs-visible#bdrstat_raft_followers_state) : The state of the followers on the Raft leader node (empty on other nodes), also includes approximate clock drift between nodes.
    - [`bdr.stat_worker`](/pgd/5.6/reference/catalogs-visible#bdrstat_worker) : Detailed information about PGD workers, including what the operation manager worker is currently doing.
    - [`bdr.stat_routing_state`](/pgd/5.6/reference/catalogs-visible#bdrstat_routing_state) : The state of the connection routing which PGD Proxy uses to route the connections.
    - [`bdr.stat_routing_candidate_state`](/pgd/5.6/reference/catalogs-visible#bdrstat_routing_candidate_state) : Information about routing candidate nodes on the Raft leader node (empty on other nodes).

  component: BDR
  component_version: 5.6.0
  details: |
   This allows defining `EXCLUDE` constraint on table replicated by PGD either with
   `CREATE TABLE` or with `ALTER TABLE` and uses similar conflict detection to resolve
   conflicts as for `UNIQUE` constraints.

  component: BDR
  component_version: 5.6.0

    This will cancel synchronous replication wait on disconnected sessions if it deadlocks against replication, preventing deadlocks on failovers when using synchronous replication. This only affects commit scopes, not synchronous replication configured via `synchronous_standby_names`.

- relnote: Do not accidentally drop the autopartition rule when a column of the autopartitioned table is dropped.
  component: BDR
  component_version: 5.6.0
  details: |
    When ALTER TABLE .. DROP COLUMN is used, the object_access_hook is fired with `classId` set to RelationRelationId, but the `subId` is set to the attribute number to differentiate it from the DROP TABLE command.

    Therefore, we need to check the subId field to make sure that we are not performing actions that should only be triggered when a table is dropped.

  details: |
    Ensure that the propagation of `bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection()` (as well as the related, deprecated `bdr.column_timestamps_(en|dis)able()` functions) is carried out correctly to all logical standbys. Previously, this propagation did not occur if the logical standby was not directly attached to the node on which the functions were executed.

  component: BDR
  component_version: 5.6.0
  details: |
    This update introduces GUCs to regulate the frequency of automatic vacuuming on the specified catalogs. The GUC `bdr.raft_vacuum_interval` determines the frequency at which tables are examined for VACUUM and ANALYZE. Autovacuum GUCs and table reloptions are utilized to ascertain the necessity of VACUUM/ANALYZE.
    The `bdr.raft_vacuum_full_interval` initiates VACUUM FULL on the tables. Users have the ability to deactivate VACUUM FULL if regular VACUUM suffices to manage bloat.

  component: BDR
  component_version: 5.6.0
  details: |
    When processing RAFT entries, it's crucial to handle duplicate requests properly to prevent Raft protocol issues. Duplicate requests can occur when a client retries a request that has already been accepted and applied by the Raft leader. The problem arose when the leader failed to detect the duplicate request due to historical evidence being pruned.

  component: BDR
  component_version: 5.6.0
  details: |
    Avoid sending Raft snapshots too frequently as it can slow down follower nodes. Limit the snapshot rate to once in every election timeout, unless there is no other communication between the nodes, in which case send a snapshot every 1/3rd of the election timeout. This will help all nodes keep pace with the leader and improve CPU utilization.

- relnote: Subscriber-only node groups have a leader
  component: BDR
  component_version: 5.6.0
  details: |
   Subscriber-only node groups have a leader elected by top-level Raft. There is now a bdr.leader catalog that tracks leadership of subgroups and subscriber-only nodes. If the node that is the leader of a subscriber-only node group goes down or becomes unreachable, a new leader is elected from that group.

- relnote: Optimized topology for subscriber-only nodes via the leader of the subscriber-only node group
  component: BDR
  component_version: 5.6.0
  details: |
   Subscriber-only nodes earlier used to have subscriptions to each data node. Now if optimized topology is enabled, only the leaders of subscriber-only node groups have subscriptions to routing leaders of data node subsgroups. The subscriber only nodegroup leaders route data to other nodes of that subscriber-only nodegroup. This reduces the load on all data nodes so they do not have to send data to all subscriber-only nodes. The GUC `bdr.force_full_mesh=off` enables this optimized topology. This GUC variable is on by default, retaining pre-5.6.0 behavior.
