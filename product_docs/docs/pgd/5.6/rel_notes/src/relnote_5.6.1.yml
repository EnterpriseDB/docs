- relnote: Add Postgres 17 support
  component: BDR
  component_version: 5.6.1
  details: |
    Support for Postgres 17 has been added for all flavors (PG, PGE, and EPAS) starting with 17.2.

- relnote:  ARM64 Processor Support
  component: BDR
  component_version: 5.6.1
  details: |
    Support ARM architecture for EDB Postgres Distributed on Debian 12 and RHEL 9.

- relnote: Address walsender crash that happend during configuration reload.
  component: BDR
  component_version: 5.6.1
  details: |
    Ensure that pglogical GUCs are overridden only when operating within the pglogical worker.
    If this is not the case, MyPGLogicalWorker will be NULL, resulting in a segmentation fault
    when the walsender attempts a configuration reload from the
    pgl_wait_for_standby_confirmation() function.

- relnote: Fix unintended eager connection related to consensus connections among Subscriber Only group members
  component: BDR
  component_version: 5.6.1
  details: |
    The msgbroker module used to establish consensus connections lazily, meaning that connections
    were created only when the first message was sent to a specific destination. This method
    negatively affected the latency of Raft leader elections. The behavior was modified to create
    connections to consensus peers eagerly. However, this change resulted in an unintended
    consequence: a fully meshed consensus network among subscriber-only nodes, which may conflict
    with customer network designs. This patch keeps the eager connection setup but limits it to
    voting nodes only, reverting to a lazy connection setup for non-voting nodes.

- relnote: Fix autopatition task scheduling.
  component: BDR
  component_version: 5.6.1
  details: |
    To improve reliability, shuffle the scheduling of autopartition tasks. This way, tasks
    that are prone to failure won't consistently impact the success of other tasks.

- relnote: Fix parting subscription with standbys.
  component: BDR
  component_version: 5.6.1
  details: |
    The parting subscription used to hang, failing to wait for standbys when the
    bdr.standby_slot_names parameter was defined.

  type: Bug-fix
  severity: High

- relnote: Add `bdr.wait_node_confirm_lsn()`.
  component: BDR
  component_version: 5.6.1
  details: |
    The function `bdr.wait_node_confirm_lsn()` has been introduced to wait until a specific node
    reaches a designated Log Sequence Number (LSN). It first checks the `confirmed_flush_lsn` of
    the replication slot for the specified node. If that information is not available, the function
    connects to the node and queries `pg_replication_origin_progress()`, using the invoking node as
    the origin.
    If the `nodename` parameter is NULL, the function will wait for all nodes to reach the specified
    LSN. If the `target` LSN is NULL, it will wait for the current `wal_flush_lsn`.

- relnote: Enhancements in SO Node Management and Progress Tracking.
  component: BDR
  component_version: 5.6.1
  details: |
    An update addresses the movement of group slots in SO nodes, ensuring they don't appear as peers in
    progress updates. Improvements include enhanced watermark management for SO leaders in the Himesh
    configuration, where write leaders now include watermarks in their updates. Watermarks are broadcasted
    to simplify progress tracking on idle clusters. The peer progress mapping for SO nodes has been corrected,
    and the tap test for group slot movement has been revised.
    Additionally, the `bdr_get_all_origins` function now considers SO node origins.

- relnote: Communicating LSN Progress in Optimized Topology Configurations.
  component: BDR
  component_version: 5.6.1
  details: |
    While there are no connections from non-leader data nodes to subscriber-only nodes in an optimized
    topology configuration, the LSN progress of all data nodes is periodically communicated to these
    subscriber-only nodes through logical replication.

- relnote: Fix parting SO node with multiple origins.
  component: BDR
  component_version: 5.6.1
  details: |
    All relevant origins must be removed when parting SO node
    With himesh, parting an SO node should result in removing all origins it
    has, not just the one related to its SO group leader.
    When parting a data node, even though there is no subscription to it
    from SO node, the origin should be removed
    DO not make SO node target of a part catchup subscription when himesh
    enabled

    Subscriber only nodes should not have slots on witness nodes.
