Released: 05 Mar 2024

EDB Postgres Distributed version 5.4.0 is a minor version of EDB Postgres Distributed.

!!! Important Recommended upgrade
We recommend that all users of PGD 5 upgrade to PGD 5.4. See [PGD/TPA upgrades](../upgrades/tpa_overview) for details.
!!!


## Highlights of EDB Postgres Distributed 5.4.0

Highlights of this 5.4.0 release include improvements to:

* Group Commit, aiming to optimize performance by minimizing the effect of a node's downtime and simplifying overall operating of PGD clusters.
* `apply_delay`, enabling the creation of a delayed read-only [replica](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/node_management/subscriber_only/) for additional options for disaster recovery and to mitigate the impact of human error, such as accidental DROP table statements.

## Compatibility

!!! Note EDB Server version compatibility
This version requires the recently released Postgres versions 14.10, 15.4,
or 16.1 (or later) of EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended
Server. No such restrictions exist for PostgreSQL Server.

Package managers on Debian, RHEL, and SLES pull in the required EDB Postgres
Advanced Server or EDB Postgres Extended upgrades with an upgrade of EDB
Postgres Distributed.
