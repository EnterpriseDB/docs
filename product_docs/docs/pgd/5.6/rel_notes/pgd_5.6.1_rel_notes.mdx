## Enhancements

<table class="table w-100"><thead><tr><th>Component</th><th>Version</th><th>Description</th><th width="10%">Addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.6.1</td><td><details><summary>Added <code>bdr.wait_node_confirm_lsn()</code>.</summary><hr/><p>The function <code>bdr.wait_node_confirm_lsn()</code> has been introduced to wait until a specific node
reaches a designated Log Sequence Number (LSN). It first checks the <code>confirmed_flush_lsn</code> of
the replication slot for the specified node. If that information is not available, the function
connects to the node and queries <code>pg_replication_origin_progress()</code>, using the invoking node as
the origin.
If the <code>nodename</code> parameter is NULL, the function will wait for all nodes to reach the specified
LSN. If the <code>target</code> LSN is NULL, it will wait for the current <code>wal_flush_lsn</code>.</p>
</details></td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.6.1</td><td><details><summary>Improvements made in SO Node Management and Progress Tracking.</summary><hr/><p>An update addresses the movement of group slots in SO nodes, ensuring they don't appear as peers in
progress updates. Improvements include enhanced watermark management for SO leaders in the Himesh
configuration, where write leaders now include watermarks in their updates. Watermarks are broadcasted
to simplify progress tracking on idle clusters. The peer progress mapping for SO nodes has been corrected,
and the tap test for group slot movement has been revised.
Additionally, the <code>bdr_get_all_origins</code> function now considers SO node origins.</p>

<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.6.1</td><td><details><summary>LSN Progress in Optimized Topology Configurations is now communicated.</summary><hr/><p>While there are no connections from non-leader data nodes to subscriber-only nodes in an optimized
topology configuration, the LSN progress of all data nodes is periodically communicated to these
subscriber-only nodes through logical replication.</p>

## Bug Fixes

<table class="table w-100"><thead><tr><th>Component</th><th>Version</th><th>Description</th><th width="10%">Addresses</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.6.1</td><td><details><summary>Addressed walsender crash that happend during configuration reload.</summary><hr/><p>Ensure that pglogical GUCs are overridden only when operating within the pglogical worker.
If this is not the case, MyPGLogicalWorker will be NULL, resulting in a segmentation fault
when the walsender attempts a configuration reload from the
pgl_wait_for_standby_confirmation() function.</p>

<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.6.1</td><td><details><summary>Fixed unintended eager connection related to consensus connections among Subscriber Only group members</summary><hr/><p>The msgbroker module used to establish consensus connections lazily, meaning that connections
were created only when the first message was sent to a specific destination. This method
negatively affected the latency of Raft leader elections. The behavior was modified to create
connections to consensus peers eagerly. However, this change resulted in an unintended
consequence: a fully meshed consensus network among subscriber-only nodes, which may conflict
with customer network designs. This patch keeps the eager connection setup but limits it to
voting nodes only, reverting to a lazy connection setup for non-voting nodes.</p>

<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.6.1</td><td><details><summary>Fixed autopatition task scheduling.</summary><hr/><p>To improve reliability, shuffle the scheduling of autopartition tasks. This way, tasks
that are prone to failure won't consistently impact the success of other tasks.</p>
</details></td><td>41998</td></tr>
<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.6.1</td><td><details><summary>Fixed parting subscription with standbys.</summary><hr/><p>The parting subscription used to hang, failing to wait for standbys when the
bdr.standby_slot_names parameter was defined.</p>
</details></td><td>41821</td></tr>
<tr><td>BDR</td><td>5.6.1</td><td><details><summary>Fixed parting SO node with multiple origins.</summary><hr/><p>All relevant origins must be removed when parting SO node
With himesh, parting an SO node should result in removing all origins it
has, not just the one related to its SO group leader.
When parting a data node, even though there is no subscription to it
from SO node, the origin should be removed
DO not make SO node target of a part catchup subscription when himesh
enabled</p>
