description: An overview of the different types of nodes that can be configured and grouped in a PGD cluster

## Data nodes

A data node in PGD is a node that runs a Postgres instance. It replicates data to all other data nodes. It also participates in the cluster-wide Raft decision-making around locking and leadership. It can be a member of one or more groups and is, by default, a member of the "top level" group that spans all data nodes in the cluster.

The data node is also the foundation on which the other three nodes are built.

## Witness nodes

A witness node behaves like a data node in that it participates in the cluster-wide Raft decision-making around locking and leadership. It doesn't replicate or store data, though. The purpose of a witness node is to be available to ensure that the cluster can achieve a majority it seeks a consensus. [Witness nodes](witness_nodes) has more details.

## Logical standby nodes

Logical standby nodes are nodes that receive the logical data changes from another node and replicate them locally. PGD can use a logical standby node to replace the node it's replicating if that node becomes unavailable, with some caveats. See [Logical standby nodes](logical_standby_nodes) for more details.

## Subscriber-only nodes

A subscriber-only node is a data node that, as the name suggests, only subscribes to changes in the cluster but doesn't replicate changes to other nodes. You can use subscriber-only nodes as read-only nodes for applications. You create subscriber-only nodes by specifying a data node is `subscriber-only` when you create the node and then adding it to a subscriber-only group. See [Subscriber-only nodes and groups](subscriber_only) for more details.
