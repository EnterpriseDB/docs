Subscriber-only nodes and groups offer a powerful way to build read scaling into your PGD cluster.

* The [Overview](overview) introduces how subscriber-only nodes and groups work in PGD.

* [Creating a subscriber-only group](creating-so) explains how to create a subscriber-only group and node.

* [Joining a node to a subscriber-only group](joining-so) explains how to join a node to an existing subscriber-only group which has members.

* [Optimizing subscriber-only groups](optimizing-so) provides details on how to configure the PGD 5.6 subscriber-only optimized topology feature which uses a group leader for more efficient replication.
