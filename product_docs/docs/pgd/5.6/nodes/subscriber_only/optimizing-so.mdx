While many use cases rely on accessing a database node which can handle queries and updates, there are also use cases which only require access to a node that can handle read-only database queries.
Read scaling like this, by moving the read-only traffic away from active database nodes in the cluster, can improve the performance of the core cluster, whilst making database access more widely available.

PGD provides this read scaling functionality through subscriber-only nodes and groups.

With PGD 5.6 and later, this topology can be optimized. For clusters using groups for their data nodes, subscriber only groups can use a more efficient model which uses a group leader, similar to a write leader in PGD Proxies.

Each subscriber-only group then has a node which replicates changes to the other subscriber-only nodes in its group.
You can have multiple subscriber-only groups, which can address different regions or different application demands.

This group leader acts as a replication proxy for incoming changes.

This model cannot be enabled if a cluster has any of the following:

* Data-nodes which are directly members of the top-level group.
* No data-node sub-groups.
* No data-node sub-groups with proxy routing enabled.

If this is the case, the nodes in a subscriber only groups automatically revert to the full mesh topology.

To get the benefit of the new SO group and node replication, you must have your data-nodes in subgroups, with proxy routing enabled on the sub groups.

## Subscriber-only group leaders

With PGD 5.6 and later, each SO group gets assigned a group leader of its own. It does not have a group Raft consensus mechanism. Instead, the cluster’s top level group Raft consensus mechanism handles selection of an SO group’s group leader.

Group leaders in SO groups are regularly tested for connectivity and if unavailable, a new SO node from the SO group is selected to become group leader and announced to the whole cluster.
Data subgroups write leaders then replicate data to this newly selected group leader node.
The Subscriber-Only node and group form the building block for PGD tree topologies.

In this topology, a small number of fully active nodes replicate changes to the “write leaders” of SO groups, these write leaders then replicate changes to the other SO group members.

This approach avoids the explosion of connections that can happen when there are large numbers of SO nodes and reduces the amount of replication traffic.

## Enabling the optimized model

By default, PGD 5.6 will force the full mesh topology. To enable the himesh topology, you must have your data-nodes in subgroups, with proxy routing enabled on the sub groups. Then you can set `bdr.force_full_mesh` to `false` to allow the optimization to take effect.
