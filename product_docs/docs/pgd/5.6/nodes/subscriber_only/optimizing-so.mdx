title: Optimizing subscriber-only groups

With PGD 5.6 and later, the topology of [subscriber-only groups](overview) can be optimized. 

For clusters using groups for their data nodes, subscriber only groups can use a more efficient model which uses a group leader, similar to a write leader in PGD Proxies.

Each subscriber-only group then has a node which replicates changes to the other subscriber-only nodes in its group.
This node is referred to as the group leader.
The group leader acts as a replication proxy for incoming changes.

You cannot enable this model if a cluster has any of the following:

* Data-nodes which are directly members of the top-level group.
* No data-node sub-groups.
* No data-node sub-groups with proxy routing enabled.

If this is the case, the nodes in a subscriber only groups automatically revert to the full mesh topology.

To get the benefit of the new SO group and node replication, you must have your data-nodes in subgroups, with proxy routing enabled on the sub groups.

## Subscriber-only group leaders

With PGD 5.6 and later, each subscriber-only group gets assigned a group leader of its own. 
This is because subscriber-only groups do not have a group Raft consensus mechanism of their own. 
Instead, the cluster’s top level group uses its Raft consensus mechanism to handle selection of each subscriber-only group’s group leader.

Group leaders in subscriber-only groups are regularly tested for connectivity and if unavailable, a new subscriber-only node from the subscriber-only group is selected to become group leader and announced to the whole cluster.
Data groups write leaders then replicate data to this newly selected group leader node.
The Subscriber-Only node and group form the building block for PGD tree topologies.

In this topology, a small number of fully active nodes, the write leaders of the data groups, replicate changes to the group leaders of subscriber-only groups, these group leaders then replicate changes to the other members of its subscriber-only group.

This approach avoids the explosion of connections that can happen when there are large numbers of SO nodes and reduces the amount of replication traffic.

## Enabling the optimized model

By default, PGD 5.6 will force the full mesh topology, meaning this optimization is off. To enable the himesh topology, you must have your data-nodes in subgroups, with proxy routing enabled on the sub groups. Then you can set `bdr.force_full_mesh` to `false` to allow the optimization to take effect.
