title: Adding nodes to a Subscriber-only group

If you have no subscriber-only groups in your PGD cluster, you must create the groups following the process in (Creating Subscriber-only groups and nodes)[creating-so]. Once you have created a subscriber-only group, you can add nodes to it.

### Adding a node to an existing subscriber-only group

Unlike adding a node to a [new subscriber-only group](creating-so), adding a node to an existing subscriber-only group is a simpler process. The node you are adding must can leverage the existing nodes in the group to manage the join.

First create the new node as a subscriber-only node. This is done by running the following SQL command on the new node:

```sql
select bdr.create_node('so-node-2', 'host=so-host-2 dbname=bdrdb port=5444', 'subscriber-only');
```

or more explicitly with parameter names:

```sql
select bdr.create_node(node_name:='so-node-2',
        dsn:='host=so-host-2 dbname=bdrdb port=5444',
        node_type:='subscriber-only');
```

This command creates a new node named `so-node-2` on host `so-host-2` and configures it as a subscriber-only node. The node will not be able to join the cluster until it is added to a group.

Now in [creating a new subscriber-only group](creating-so), we created a group named `sogroup` and added asubscriber-only node called `so-node-1` on a host `shost-1`. As we want to add a new node to the group, we can use the following SQL command on :

```sql
select bdr.join_node_group('host=shost-1 dbname=bdrdb port=5444','sogroup');
```

or more explicitly with parameter names:

```sql
select bdr.join_node_group(dsn:='host=shost-1 dbname=bdrdb port=5444',
        node_group_name:='sogroup');
```

This command instructs the new node to join the `sogroup` group. As it has no knowledge of the cluster topology, it will connect to the node specified in the DSN to receive the necessary information to join the group. Here, as we've already joined a node to the subscriber-only group, we can use that node `so-node-1` rather than a node in another group.

Once the new node has joined the group, it will begin replicating changes from the other nodes in the cluster; unless the group is using the [optimized topology](optimizing-so), in which case it will replicate changes from a group leade in the subscriber-only group.
