If you have no subscriber-only groups in your PGD cluster, you must create the groups following the process in (Creating Subscriber-only groups and nodes)[creating-so]. Once you have created a subscriber-only group, you can join subscriber-only nodes to it.

### Joining a node to an existing subscriber-only group

Unlike joining a node to a [new subscriber-only group](creating-so), joining a node to an existing subscriber-only group is a simpler process. 

First create the new node as a subscriber-only node. Run the following SQL command on the new node:

```sql
select bdr.create_node('so-node-2', 'host=so-host-2 dbname=bdrdb port=5444', 'subscriber-only');
```

or more explicitly with parameter names:

```sql
select bdr.create_node(node_name:='so-node-2',
        dsn:='host=so-host-2 dbname=bdrdb port=5444',
        node_type:='subscriber-only');
```

This command creates a new node named `so-node-2` on host `so-host-2` and configures it as a subscriber-only node. The node won't be able to join the cluster until joins a group. The DSN h

Now in [creating a new subscriber-only group](creating-so), you created a group named `sogroup` and added a subscriber-only node called `so-node-1` on a host `shost-1`. It used a node in an existing data group to facilitate that join. Now that the group exists, the node join can leverage the existing node in the group to manage the join. In this case, `shost-1`, you can use the following SQL command on `shost-2` to join it to the `sogroup` group:

```sql
select bdr.join_node_group('host=shost-1 dbname=bdrdb port=5444','sogroup');
```

or more explicitly with parameter names:

```sql
select bdr.join_node_group(dsn:='host=shost-1 dbname=bdrdb port=5444',
        node_group_name:='sogroup');
```

This command instructs the new node to join the `sogroup` group. As it has no knowledge of the cluster topology, it connects to the node specified in the DSN to receive the necessary information to join the group.

Once the new node has joined the group, it will begin replicating changes from the other nodes in the cluster. 

!!! Note 
Unless, the group is using the [optimized topology](optimizing-so), in which case it replicates changes from a subscriber-only group leader in the subscriber-only group it has joined.
