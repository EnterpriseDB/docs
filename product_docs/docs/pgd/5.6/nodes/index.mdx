A PGD cluster can contain several different types of node, each with its own role. This section describes the different types of node that can be configured in a PGD cluster.

* [Node types](node_types) is an overview the kinds of node that can exist in PGD clusters.

* [Subscriber-only nodes and groups](subscriber_only) looks at how subscriber-only nodes work with subscriber-only groups, how they boost read scalability and the different options for configuring them.

* [Witness_nodes](witness_nodes) looks at the witness node, a special class of PGD node, dedicated to establishing consensus in a group.

* [Logical standby nodes](logical_standby_nodes) shows how to efficiently keep a node on standby synchronized and ready to step in as a primary in the case of failure.
