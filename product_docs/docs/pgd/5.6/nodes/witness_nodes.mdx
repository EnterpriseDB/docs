description: Used to enable consensus in PGD clusters, both within clusters and outside regions

A witness node is a lightweight node that functions as a data node but that
doesn't store or replicate data. Use a witness node to allow a PGD cluster that uses
Raft consensus to have an odd number of voting nodes and therefore be able to
achieve a majority when making decisions.

## Witness nodes within PGD groups or regions

One typical use of witness nodes is when a PGD group has two data nodes but
resources aren't available for the recommended three data nodes. In this case,
you can add a witness node to the PGD group to provide a third voting node to
local Raft decision-making. These decisions are primarily about who will be
electing a write leader for the proxies to use. With only two nodes, it's possible 
to have no consensus over which data node is write leader. With two data nodes
and a witness, there are two candidates (the data nodes) and three voters
(the data nodes and the witness). When a data node is down, then, there
are still two voters that can select a write leader.

## Witness node outside regions

At a higher level, you can use witness nodes when multiple PGD groups are
mapped to different regions. For example, with three data nodes per region in two
regions, while running normally, all six data nodes can participate in Raft
decisions and obtain DDL and DML global locks. Even when a data
node is down, there are sufficient data nodes to obtain a consensus. But if a
network partition occurs and connectivity with the other region is lost, then
now only three nodes out of six are available, which isn't enough for a
consensus. To avoid this scenario, you can deploy a witness node in a third region
as part of the PGD cluster. This witness node will allow a consensus to
be achieved for most operational requirements of the PGD cluster while a region
is unavailable.
