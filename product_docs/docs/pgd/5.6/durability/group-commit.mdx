Commit scope kind: `GROUP COMMIT`

## Overview

The goal of Group Commit is to protect against data loss in case of single node
failures or temporary outages. You achieve this by requiring more than one PGD
node to successfully confirm a transaction at COMMIT time. Confirmation can be sent
at a number of points in the transaction processing but defaults to "visible" when
the transaction has been flushed to disk and is visible to all other transactions.


## Example

```sql
SELECT bdr.add_commit_scope(
    commit_scope_name := 'example_scope',
    origin_node_group := 'left_dc',
    rule := 'ALL (left_dc) GROUP COMMIT(commit_decision=raft) AND ANY 1 (right_dc) GROUP COMMIT',
    wait_for_ready := true
);
```

This example creates a commit scope where all the nodes in the `left_dc` group and any one of the nodes in the `right_dc` group must receive and successfully confirm a committed transaction.


## Requirements

During normal operation, Group Commit is transparent to the application.
Transactions that were in progress during failover need the reconciliation phase
triggered or consolidated by either the application or a proxy in between. This
activity currently happens only when either the origin node recovers or when
it's parted from the cluster. This behavior is the same as with Postgres legacy
built-in synchronous replication.

Transactions committed with Group Commit use [two-phase
commit](../terminology/#two-phase-commit-2pc) underneath. Therefore, configure
`max_prepared_transactions` high enough to handle all such transactions
originating per node.

## Limitations

See the Group Commit section of [Limitations](limitations#group-commit).


## Configuration

To use Group Commit, first define a [commit scope](commit-scopes). The commit scope
determines the PGD nodes involved in the commit of a transaction.

## Confirmation

   Confirmation&nbsp;level    | Group Commit handling
-------------------------|-------------------------------
 `received`              | A remote PGD node confirms the transaction immediately after receiving it, prior to starting the local application.
 `replicated`            |  Confirms after applying changes of the transaction but before flushing them to disk.
 `durable`               |  Confirms the transaction after all of its changes are flushed to disk.
 `visible` (default)     | Confirms the transaction after all of its changes are flushed to disk and it's visible to concurrent transactions.


## Behavior

The behavior of Group Commit depends on the configuration applied by the commit
scope.

### Commit decisions

You can configure Group Commit to decide commits in three different ways: `group`,
`partner`, and `raft`.

The `group` decision is the default. It specifies that the commit is confirmed
by the origin node upon receiving as many confirmations as required by the
commit scope group. The difference is that the commit decision is made based on
PREPARE replication while the durability checks COMMIT (PREPARED) replication.

The `partner` decision is what [Commit At Most Once](camo) (CAMO) uses. This approach
works only when there are two data nodes in the node group. These two nodes are
partners of each other, and the replica rather than origin decides whether
to commit something. This approach requires application changes to use
the CAMO transaction protocol to work correctly, as the application is in some way
part of the consensus. For more on this approach, see [CAMO](camo).

The `raft` decision uses PGDs built-in Raft consensus for commit decisions. Use of the `raft` decision can reduce performance. It's currently required only when using `GROUP COMMIT`
with an ALL commit scope group.

Using an ALL commit scope group requires that the commit decision must be set to
`raft` to avoid [reconciliation](#transaction-reconciliation) issues. 

### Conflict resolution

Conflict resolution can be `async` or `eager`.

Async means that PGD does optimistic conflict resolution during replication
using the row-level resolution as configured for a given node. This happens
regardless of whether the origin transaction committed or is still in progress.
See [Conflicts](../consistency/conflicts) for details about how the asynchronous
conflict resolution works.

Eager means that conflicts are resolved eagerly (as part of agreement on
COMMIT), and conflicting transactions get aborted with a serialization error.
This approach provides greater isolation than the asynchronous resolution at the
price of performance. 

Using an ALL commit scope group requires that the [commit
decision](#commit-decisions) must be set to `raft` to avoid reconciliation
issues.

For details about how Eager conflict resolution works,
see [Eager conflict resolution](../consistency/eager). 

### Aborts

To prevent a transaction that can't get consensus on the COMMIT from hanging
forever, the `ABORT ON` clause allows specifying timeout. After the timeout, the
transaction abort is requested. If the transaction is already
decided to be committed at the time the abort request is sent, the transaction
does eventually COMMIT even though the client might receive an abort message.

See also [Limitations](limitations). 

### Transaction reconciliation

A Group Commit transaction's commit on the origin node is implicitly converted 
into a two-phase commit. 

In the first phase (prepare), the transaction is prepared locally and made ready to commit.
The data is made durable but is uncomitted at this stage, so other transactions
can't see the changes made by this transaction. This prepared transaction gets
copied to all remaining nodes through normal logical replication.

The origin node seeks confirmations from other nodes, as per rules in the Group
Commit grammar. If it gets confirmations from the minimum required nodes in the
cluster, it decides to commit this transaction moving onto the second phase (commit). 
In the commit phase, it also sends this decision by way of replication to other nodes. Those nodes will also eventually commit on getting this message.

There's a possibility of failure at various stages. For example, the origin
node may crash after preparing the transaction. Or the origin and one or more
replicas may crash.

This leaves the prepared transactions in the system. The `pg_prepared_xacts`
view in Postgres can show prepared transactions on a system. The prepared
transactions might be holding locks and other resources. To release those locks and resources, either abort or commit the transaction. 
That decision must be made with a consensus
of nodes. 

When `commit_decision` is `raft`, then, Raft acts as the reconciliator, and these
transactions are eventually reconciled automatically. 

When the `commit_decision` is `group`, then, transactions don't use Raft. Instead 
the write lead in the cluster performs the role of reconciliator. This is because 
it's the node that's most ahead with respect to changes in its subgroup. It 
detects when a node is down and initiates reconciliation for such a node by looking
for prepared transactions it has with the down node as the origin. 

For all such transactions, it sees if the nodes as per the rules of the commit
scope have the prepared transaction, it takes a decision. This decision is
conveyed over Raft and needs the majority of the nodes to be up to do
reconciliation.

This process happens in the background. There's no command for you to use to
control or issue this.
