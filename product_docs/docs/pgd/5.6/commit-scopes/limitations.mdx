title: Limitations
---

The following limitations apply to the use of commit scopes and the various durability options they enable.

## General limitations

-   [Legacy synchronous replication](legacy-sync) uses a mechanism for transaction confirmation
    different from the one used by CAMO, Eager, and Group Commit. The two aren't
    compatible, so don't use them together. Whenever you use Group Commit, CAMO,
    or Eager, make sure none of the PGD nodes are configured in
    `synchronous_standby_names`.

-   Postgres two-phase commit (2PC) transactions (that is, [`PREPARE
    TRANSACTION`](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-prepare-transaction.html))
    can't be used with CAMO, Group Commit, or Eager because those
    features use two-phase commit underneath.

## Group Commit

[Group Commit](group-commit) enables configurable synchronous commits over 
nodes in a group. If you use this feature, take the following limitations into account:

- Not all DDL can run when you use Group Commit. If you use unsupported DDL, a warning is logged, and the transactions commit scope is set to local. The only supported DDL operations are:
    - Nonconcurrent `CREATE INDEX`
    - Nonconcurrent `DROP INDEX`
    - Nonconcurrent `REINDEX` of an individual table or index
    - `CLUSTER` (of a single relation or index only)
    - `ANALYZE`
    - `TRUNCATE`


- Explicit two-phase commit isn't supported by Group Commit as it already uses two-phase commit.

- Combining different commit decision options in the same transaction or
  combining different conflict resolution options in the same transaction isn't
  supported.

- Currently, Raft commit decisions are extremely slow, producing very low TPS.
  We recommended using them only with the `eager` conflict resolution setting
  to get the Eager All-Node Replication behavior of PGD 4 and older.

## Eager

[Eager](../conflict-management/eager) is available through Group Commit. It avoids conflicts by eagerly aborting transactions that might clash. It's subject to the same limitations as Group Commit. 

Eager doesn't allow the `NOTIFY` SQL command or the `pg_notify()` function. It
also doesn't allow `LISTEN` or `UNLISTEN`.

## CAMO

[Commit At Most Once](camo) (CAMO) is a feature that aims to prevent
applications committing more than once. If you use this feature, take 
these limitations into account when planning:

- CAMO is designed to query the results of a recently failed COMMIT on the
origin node. In case of disconnection, the application must request the
transaction status from the CAMO partner. Ensure that you have as little delay
as possible after the failure before requesting the status. Applications must
not rely on CAMO decisions being stored for longer than 15 minutes.

- If the application forgets the global identifier assigned, for example,
as a result of a restart, there's no easy way to recover
it. Therefore, we recommend that applications wait for outstanding
transactions to end before shutting down.

- For the client to apply proper checks, a transaction protected by CAMO
can't be a single statement with implicit transaction control. You also can't
use CAMO with a transaction-controlling procedure or
in a `DO` block that tries to start or end transactions.

- CAMO resolves commit status but doesn't resolve pending
notifications on commit. CAMO doesn't
allow the `NOTIFY` SQL command or the `pg_notify()` function.
They also don't allow `LISTEN` or `UNLISTEN`.

- When replaying changes, CAMO transactions might detect conflicts just
the same as other transactions. If timestamp-conflict detection is used,
the CAMO transaction uses the timestamp of the prepare-on-the-origin
node, which is before the transaction becomes visible on the origin
node itself.

- CAMO isn't currently compatible with transaction streaming.
Be sure to disable transaction streaming when planning to use
CAMO. You can configure this option globally or in the PGD node group. See
[Transaction streaming configuration](../transaction-streaming#configuration).

- CAMO isn't currently compatible with decoding worker.
Be sure to not enable decoding worker when planning to use
CAMO. You can configure this option in the PGD node group. See
[Decoding worker disabling](../decoding_worker#enabling).

-   Not all DDL can run when you use CAMO. If you use unsupported DDL, a warning is logged and the transactions commit scope is set to local only. The only supported DDL operations are:
    - Nonconcurrent `CREATE INDEX`
    - Nonconcurrent `DROP INDEX`
    - Nonconcurrent `REINDEX` of an individual table or index
    - `CLUSTER` (of a single relation or index only)
    - `ANALYZE`
    - `TRUNCATE`


- Explicit two-phase commit isn't supported by CAMO as it already uses two-phase commit.

- You can combine only CAMO transactions with the `DEGRADE TO` clause for
switching to asynchronous operation in case of lowered availability.
