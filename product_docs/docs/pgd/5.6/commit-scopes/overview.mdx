## Overview

EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) allows you to choose from several replication
configurations based on your durability, consistency, availability, and
performance needs using *commit scopes*.

In its basic configuration, PGD uses asynchronous replication. However, commit
scopes can change both the default and the per-transaction behavior.

It's also possible to configure the legacy Postgres synchronous replication
using standard `synchronous_standby_names` in the same way as the built-in
physical or logical replication. However, commit scopes provide much more
flexibility and control over the replication behavior.

The different synchronization settings affect three properties of interest
to applications that are related but can all be implemented individually:

-   Durability: Writing to multiple nodes increases crash resilience
    and allows you to recover the data after a crash and restart.

-   Visibility: With the commit confirmation to the client, the database
    guarantees immediate visibility of the committed transaction on some
    sets of nodes.

-   Conflict handling: Conflicts can be handled optimistically
    postcommit, with conflicts resolved when the transaction is replicated
    based on commit timestamps. Or, they can be handled pessimistically
    precommit. The client can rely on the transaction to eventually be
    applied on all nodes without further conflicts or get an abort, directly
    informing the client of an error.

Commit scopes allow four kinds of controlling durability of the transaction:

-   [Synchronous Commit](synchronous_commit): This kind of commit scope allows for a behavior where the origin node awaits a majority of nodes to confirm and behaves more like a native Postgres synchronous commit.

-   [Group Commit](group-commit): This kind of commit scope controls which and how many nodes
    have to reach a consensus before the transaction is considered to be committable
    and at what stage of replication it can be considered committed. This option also
    allows you to control the visibility ordering of the transaction.

-   [CAMO](camo): This kind of commit scope is a variant of Group Commit, in
    which the client takes on the responsibility for verifying that a transaction
    was committed before retrying.

-   [Lag Control](lag-control): This kind of commit scope controls how far behind nodes can 
    be in terms of replication before allowing commit to proceed.

Synchronous commit, group commit, and CAMO each support [degrading commit scope rules](degrading), for even further control of durability.

!!! Note Legacy synchronization availability 
For backward compatibility, PGD still supports configuring synchronous
replication with `synchronous_commit` and `synchronous_standby_names`. See
[Legacy synchronous replication](legacy-sync) for more on this option. We
recommend that you use [PGD Synchronous Commit](synchronous_commit) instead.
