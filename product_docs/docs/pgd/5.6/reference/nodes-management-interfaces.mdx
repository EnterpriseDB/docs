## `bdr.alter_node_group_option`

This function modifies a PGD node group configuration.

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_node_group_option(node_group_name text,
    config_key text,
    config_value text)
```

### Parameters

-   `node_group_name` &mdash; Name of the group to change.
-   `config_key` &mdash; Key of the option in the node group to change.
-   `config_value` &mdash; New value to set for the given key.

    `config_value` is parsed into the data type appropriate for the option.

The table shows the group options that can be changed using this function. Some parameters can be applied only to the top-level node group. For these parameters, the Groups column contains Top. Some parameters can be applied to the top-level node group and subgroups. For these parameters, the Groups column contains All. When a parameter can be applied only to subgroups, the Groups column contains Sub.

| Name | Type | Groups | Description |
| ---- | ---- | ------ | ----------- |
| `apply_delay` | `interval` | All | How long nodes wait to apply incoming changes. This option is useful mainly to set up a special subgroup with delayed subscriber-only nodes. Don't set this on groups that contain data nodes or on the top-level group. Default is `0s`. |
| `check_constraints` | `boolean` | Top | Whether the apply process checks the constraints when writing replicated data. We recommend keeping the default value or you risk data loss. Valid values are `on` or `off`. Default is `on`. |
| `default_commit_scope` | `text` |  All | The commit scope to use by default, initially the `local` commit scope. This option applies only to the top-level node group. You can use individual rules for different origin groups of the same commit scope. See [Origin groups](../durability/commit-scopes/#origin-groups) for more details. |
| `enable_proxy_routing` | `boolean` | All | Where [`pgd-proxy`](../routing/proxy) through the group leader is enabled for given group. Valid values are `on` or `off`. Default is `off`. |
| `enable_raft` | `boolean` | Sub | Whether group has its own Raft consensus. This option is necessary for setting `enable_proxy_routing` to `on`. This option is always `on` for the top-level group. Valid values are `on` or `off`. Default is `off` for subgroups. |
| `enable_wal_decoder` | `boolean` | Top | Enables/disables the decoding worker process. You can't enable the decoding worker process if `streaming_mode` is already enabled. Valid values are `on` or `off`. Default is `off`. |
| `location` | `text` | All | Information about group location. This option is purely metadata for monitoring. Default is `''` (empty string). |
| `num_writers` | `integer` | Top | Number of parallel writers for the subscription backing this node group. Valid values are `-1` or a positive integer. `-1` means the value specified by the GUC [`bdr.writers_per_subscription`](pgd-settings#bdrwriters_per_subscription) is used. `-1` is the default. |
| `route_reader_max_lag` | `integer` | All | Maximum lag in bytes for a node to be considered a viable read-only node. Currently reserved for future use. |
| `route_writer_max_lag` | `integer` | All | Maximum lag in bytes of the new write candidate to be selected as write leader. If no candidate passes this, no writer is selected. Default is `-1`. |
| `route_writer_wait_flush` | `boolean` | All | Whether to switch if PGD needs to wait for the flush. Currently reserved for future use. |
| `streaming_mode` | `text` | Top | Enables/disables streaming of large transactions. When set to `off`, streaming is disabled. When set to any other value, large transactions are decoded while they're still in progress, and the changes are sent to the downstream. If the value is set to `file`, then the incoming changes of streaming transactions are stored in a file and applied only after the transaction is committed on upstream. If the value is set to `writer`, then the incoming changes are directly sent to one of the writers, if available.<br/> If [parallel apply](../parallelapply) is disabled or no writer is free to handle streaming transactions, then the changes are written to a file and applied after the transaction is committed. If the value is set to `auto`, PGD tries to intelligently pick between `file` and `writer`, depending on the transaction property and available resources. You can't enable `streaming_mode` if the WAL decoder is already enabled. Default is `auto`.<br/><br/>For more details, see [Transaction streaming](../transaction-streaming). |


### Return value

`bdr.alter_node_group_option()` returns `VOID` on success.

An `ERROR` is raised if any of the provided parameters is invalid.

### Notes

You can examine the current state of node group options by way of the view
[`bdr.node_group_summary`](catalogs-visible#bdrnode_group_summary).

This function passes a request to the group consensus mechanism to change
the defaults. The changes made are replicated globally using the consensus
mechanism.

The function isn't transactional. The request is processed in the background,
so you can't roll back the function call. Also, the changes might not be
immediately visible to the current transaction.

This function doesn't hold any locks.

## `bdr.alter_node_interface`

This function changes the connection string (`DSN`) of a specified node.

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_node_interface(node_name text, interface_dsn text)
```

### Parameters

-   `node_name` &mdash; Name of an existing node to alter.
-   `interface_dsn` &mdash; New connection string for a node.

### Notes

Run this function and make the changes only on the local node. This means that you normally execute it on every node in the
PGD group, including the node that's being changed.

This function is transactional. You can roll it back, and the changes are
visible to the current transaction.

The function holds lock on the local node.


## `bdr.alter_node_option`

This function modifies the PGD node routing configuration.

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_node_option(node_name text,
    config_key text,
    config_value text);
```

### Parameters

-   `node_name` &mdash; Name of the node to change.
-   `config_key` &mdash; Key of the option in the node to change.
-   `config_value` &mdash; New value to set for the given key.

The node options you can change using this function are:
- `route_priority` &mdash; Relative routing priority of the node against other nodes in the same node group. Default is `'-1'`.
- `route_fence` &mdash; Whether the node is fenced from routing. When true, the node can't receive connections from PGD Proxy. Default is `'f'` (false).
- `route_writes` &mdash; Whether writes can be routed to this node, that is, whether the node can become write leader. Default is `'t'` (true) for data nodes and `'f'` (false) for other node types.
- `route_reads` &mdash; Whether read-only connections can be routed to this node. Currently reserved for future use. Default is `'t'` (true) for data and subscriber-only nodes, `'f'` (false) for witness and standby nodes.
- `route_dsn` &mdash; The dsn for the proxy to use to connect to this node. This option is optional. If not set, it defaults to the node's `node_dsn` value.

## `bdr.alter_subscription_enable`

This function enables either the specified subscription or all the subscriptions of the
local PGD node. This is also known as resume subscription.
No error is thrown if the subscription is already enabled.
Returns the number of subscriptions affected by this operation.

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_subscription_enable(
    subscription_name name DEFAULT NULL,
    immediate boolean DEFAULT false
)
```

### Parameters

-   `subscription_name` &mdash; Name of the subscription to enable. If NULL
     (the default), all subscriptions on the local node are enabled.
-   `immediate` &mdash; This parameter currently has no effect.

### Notes

This function isn't replicated and affects only local node subscriptions
(either a specific node or all nodes).

This function is transactional. You can roll it back, and the current transaction can see any catalog changes. The subscription workers are started
by a background process after the transaction has committed.

## `bdr.alter_subscription_disable`

This function disables either the specified subscription or all the
subscriptions of the local PGD node. Optionally, it can also immediately stop
all the workers associated with the disabled subscriptions. This is also known as pause
subscription. No error is thrown if the subscription is already disabled.
Returns the number of subscriptions affected by this operation.

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_subscription_disable(
    subscription_name name DEFAULT NULL,
    immediate boolean DEFAULT false,
    fast boolean DEFAULT true
)
```

### Parameters

-   `subscription_name` &mdash; Name of the subscription to disable. If NULL
     (the default), all subscriptions on the local node are disabled.
-   `immediate` &mdash; Used to force the action immediately, stopping
     all the workers associated with the disabled subscription. When this option is
     `true`, you can't run this function inside of the transaction block.
-   `fast` &mdash; This argument influences the behavior of `immediate`.
     If set to `true` (the default), it stops all the workers associated with the
     disabled subscription without waiting for them to finish current work.

### Notes

This function isn't replicated and affects only local node subscriptions
(either a specific subscription or all subscriptions).

This function is transactional. You can roll it back, and the current transaction can see any catalog changes.
However, the timing of the subscription
worker stopping depends on the value of `immediate`. If set to `true`, the
workers receive the stop without waiting for the `COMMIT`. If the `fast`
argument is set to `true`, the interruption of the workers doesn't wait for
current work to finish.

## `bdr.create_node`

This function creates a node.

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.create_node(node_name text,
                local_dsn text,
                node_kind DEFAULT NULL)
```

### Parameters

-   `node_name` &mdash; Name of the new node. Only one node is allowed per
      database. Valid node names consist of lowercase letters, numbers,
      hyphens, and underscores.
-   `local_dsn` &mdash; Connection string to the node.
-   `node_kind` &mdash; One of `data` (the default), `standby`, `subscriber-only`,
      or `witness`. If you don't set this parameter, or if you provide `NULL`,
      the default `data` node kind is used.

### Notes

This function creates a record for the local node with the associated
public connection string. There can be only one local record, so once it's
created, the function reports an error if run again.

This function is a transactional function. You can roll it back and the
changes made by it are visible to the current transaction.

The function holds lock on the newly created node until the end of
the transaction.

## `bdr.create_node_group`

This function creates a PGD node group. By default, the local node joins the
group as the only member. You can add more nodes to the group with
[`bdr.join_node_group()`](#bdrjoin_node_group).

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.create_node_group(node_group_name text,
                      parent_group_name text DEFAULT NULL,
                      join_node_group boolean DEFAULT true,
                      node_group_type text DEFAULT NULL)
```

### Parameters

-   `node_group_name` &mdash; Name of the new PGD group. As with the node
      name, valid group names must consist of only lowercase letters, numbers,
      and underscores.
-   `parent_group_name` &mdash; If a node subgroup is being created, this must be the
      name of the parent group. Provide `NULL` (the default) when creating the main
      node group for the cluster.
-   `join_node_group` &mdash; Determines whether the node
      joins the group being created. The default value is `true`. Providing `false` when 
      creating a subgroup means the local node won't join the new group, for example, when 
      creating an independent remote group.
      In this case, you must specify `parent_group_name`.
-   `node_group_type` &mdash; The valid values are `NULL` or `subscriber-only`. `NULL` (the default) is for creating a normal, general-purpose
      node group. `subscriber-only` is for creating [subscriber-only groups](../node_management/subscriber_only/)
      whose members receive changes only from the fully joined nodes in the cluster
      but that never send changes to other nodes.

### Notes

This function passes a request to the local consensus worker that's running for
the local node.

The function isn't transactional. The creation of the group is a background
process, so once the function finishes, you can't roll back the changes.
Also, the changes might not be immediately visible to the current transaction.
You can call `bdr.wait_for_join_completion` to wait until they are.

The group creation doesn't hold any locks.

## `bdr.join_node_group`

This function joins the local node to an already existing PGD group.

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.join_node_group (
    join_target_dsn text,
    node_group_name text DEFAULT NULL,
    pause_in_standby boolean DEFAULT NULL,
    wait_for_completion boolean DEFAULT true,
    synchronize_structure text DEFAULT 'all'
)
```

### Parameters

-   `join_target_dsn` &mdash; Specifies the connection string to an existing (source) node
     in the PGD group you want to add the local node to.
-   `node_group_name` &mdash; Optional name of the PGD group. Defaults to NULL, which
     tries to detect the group name from information present on the source
     node.
-   `wait_for_completion` &mdash; Wait for the join process to complete before
     returning. Defaults to `true`.
-   `synchronize_structure` &mdash; Set the kind of structure (schema) synchronization
     to do during the join.  The default setting is `all`, which synchronizes
     the complete database structure, The other available setting is `none`, which doesn't
     synchronize any structure. However, it still synchronizes data (except for witness
     nodes, which by design don't synchronize data).
-   `pause_in_standby` &mdash; Optionally tells the join process to join only as a
     logical standby node, which can be later promoted to a full member.
     This option is deprecated and will be disabled or removed in future
     versions of PGD.

!!! Warning
    `pause_in_standby` is deprecated since BDR 5.0. The recommended way to create
    a logical standby is to set `node_kind` to `standby` when creating the node
    with [`bdr.create_node`](#bdrcreate_node).

If `wait_for_completion` is specified as `false`, the function call returns
as soon as the joining procedure starts. You can see the progress of the join in
the log files and the [`bdr.event_summary`](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-internal#bdrevent_summary)
information view. You can call the function [`bdr.wait_for_join_completion()`](#bdrwait_for_join_completion)
after `bdr.join_node_group()` to wait for the join operation to complete.
It can emit progress information if called with `verbose_progress` set to `true`.

### Notes

This function passes a request to the group consensus mechanism by way of the node
that the `join_target_dsn` connection string points to.
The changes made are replicated globally by the consensus mechanism.

The function isn't transactional. The joining process happens in the
background and you can't roll it back. The changes are visible only
to the local transaction if `wait_for_completion` was set to `true` or by calling
`bdr.wait_for_join_completion` later.

Node can be part of only a single group, so you can call this function only once
on each node.

Node join doesn't hold any locks in the PGD group.

## `bdr.part_node`

Removes (parts) the node from the PGD group but doesn't remove data
from the node.

You can call the function from any active node in the PGD group, including
the node that you're removing. However, once the
node is parted, it can't part other nodes in the cluster.

!!! Note
    If you're parting the local node, you must set `wait_for_completion`
    to `false`. Otherwise, it reports an error.

!!! Warning
    This action is permanent. If you want to temporarily halt replication
    to a node, use `bdr.alter_subscription_disable()`.

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.part_node (
    node_name text,
	wait_for_completion boolean DEFAULT true,
	force boolean DEFAULT false
)
```

### Parameters

-   `node_name` &mdash; Name of an existing node to part.
-   `wait_for_completion` &mdash; If `true`, the function doesn't return until the
    node is fully parted from the cluster. Otherwise the function
    starts the parting procedure and returns immediately without waiting.
    Always set to `false` when executing on the local node or when using `force`.
-   `force` &mdash; Forces removal of the node on the local node. This sets the
    node state locally if consensus can't be reached or if the node-parting
    process is stuck.

!!! Warning
    Using `force = true` can leave the PGD group in an inconsistent
    state. Use it only to recover from failures in which you can't
    remove the node any other way.

### Notes

This function passes a request to the group consensus mechanism to part
the given node. The changes made are replicated globally by the consensus
mechanism. The parting process happens in the background, and you can't
roll it back. The changes made by the parting process are visible only to
the local transaction if `wait_for_completion` was set to `true`.

With `force` set to `true`, on consensus failure, this function sets the
state of the given node only on the local node. In such a case, the function is
transactional (because the function changes the node state) and you can
roll it back. If the function is called on a node that's already in process of
parting with `force` set to `true`, it also marks the given node as
parted locally and exits. This is useful only when the consensus can't be
reached on the cluster (that is, the majority of the nodes are down) or if the
parting process is stuck. But it's important to take into
account that when the parting node that was receiving writes, the parting process
can take a long time without being stuck. The other nodes need to resynchronize
any missing data from the given node. The force parting completely skips this
resynchronization and can leave the other nodes in an inconsistent state.

The parting process doesn't hold any locks.

## `bdr.promote_node`

This function promotes a local logical standby node to a full member of the PGD group.

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.promote_node(wait_for_completion boolean DEFAULT true)
```

### Notes

This function passes a request to the group consensus mechanism to change
the defaults. The changes made are replicated globally by the consensus
mechanism.

The function isn't transactional. The promotion process happens in the
background, and you can't roll it back. The changes are visible only
to the local transaction if `wait_for_completion` was set to `true` or by calling
`bdr.wait_for_join_completion` later.

The promotion process holds lock against other promotions. This lock doesn't
block other `bdr.promote_node` calls but prevents the background process of
promotion from moving forward on more than one node at a time.

## `bdr.switch_node_group`

This function switches the local node from its current subgroup to another subgroup in the same existing PGD node group.

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.switch_node_group (
    node_group_name text,
    wait_for_completion boolean DEFAULT true
)
```

### Parameters

-   `node_group_name` &mdash; Name of the PGD group or subgroup.
-   `wait_for_completion` &mdash; Wait for the switch process to complete before
    returning. Defaults to `true`.

If `wait_for_completion` is specified as `false`,
this is an asynchronous call that returns as soon as the switching procedure starts.
You can see progress of the switch in logs and the
`bdr.event_summary` information view or by calling the
`bdr.wait_for_join_completion()` function after `bdr.switch_node_group()` returns.

### Notes

This function passes a request to the group consensus mechanism.
The changes made are replicated globally by the consensus mechanism.

The function isn't transactional. The switching process happens in the
background and you can't roll it back. The changes are visible only
to the local transaction if `wait_for_completion` was set to `true` or by calling
`bdr.wait_for_join_completion` later.

The local node changes membership from its current subgroup to another subgroup in the same PGD node group without needing to part the cluster. The node's kind must match that of existing nodes in the target subgroup.

Node switching doesn't hold any locks in the PGD group.

Restrictions: Currently, the function allows switching only between a subgroup and its PGD node group. To effect a move between subgroups you need to make two separate calls: 1) switch from subgroup to node group and, 2) switch from node group to other subgroup.

## `bdr.wait_for_join_completion`

This function waits for the join procedure of a local node to finish.

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.wait_for_join_completion(verbose_progress boolean DEFAULT false)
```

### Parameters

-   `verbose_progress` &mdash; Optionally prints information about individual steps
    taken during the join procedure.

### Notes

This function waits until the checks state of the local node reaches the target
state, which was set by `bdr.create_node_group`, `bdr.join_node_group`, or
`bdr.promote_node`.


## `bdr.alter_node_group_config`

This function changes the configuration parameters of an existing PGD group.
Options with NULL value (default for all of them) aren't modified.

!!! Warning
    This function exists only for compatibility with PGD4 and 3.7. 
    Use [`bdr.alter_node_group_option`](#bdralter_node_group_option) instead.

### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.alter_node_group_config(node_group_name text,
                            insert_to_update boolean DEFAULT NULL,
                            update_to_insert boolean DEFAULT NULL,
                            ignore_redundant_updates boolean DEFAULT NULL,
                            check_full_tuple boolean DEFAULT NULL,
                            apply_delay interval DEFAULT NULL,
                            check_constraints boolean DEFAULT NULL,
                            num_writers int DEFAULT NULL,
							enable_wal_decoder boolean DEFAULT NULL,
							streaming_mode text DEFAULT NULL,
                            default_commit_scope text DEFAULT NULL)
```

### Parameters

| Name | Description |
| ---- | ------------|
| `node_group_name` | Name of an existing PGD group. The local node must be part of the group. |
| `insert_to_update` | Reserved for backward compatibility. |
| `update_to_insert` | Reserved for backward compatibility. This option is deprecated and will be disabled or removed in future versions of PGD. Use `bdr.alter_node_set_conflict_resolver` instead. |
| `ignore_redundant_updates` | Reserved for backward compatibility. |
| `check_full_tuple` | Reserved for backward compatibility. |
| `apply_delay` | How long nodes wait to apply incoming changes. This parameter is useful mainly to set up a special subgroup with delayed subscriber-only nodes. Don't set this on groups that contain data nodes or on the top-level group. Default is `0s`. |
| `check_constraints` | Whether the apply process checks the constraints when writing replicated data. We recommend keeping this set to the default value or you risk data loss. Valid values are `on` or `off`. Default is `on`. Applies to top-level group only. |
| `num_writers` | Number of parallel writers for the subscription backing this node group. Valid values are `-1` or a positive integer. `-1` means the value specified by the GUC `bdr.writers_per_subscription` is used. `-1` is the default. Applies to top-level group only.|
| `enable_wal_decoder` | Enables/disables the decoding worker process. You can't enable the decoding worker process if `streaming_mode` is already enabled. Valid values are `on` or `off`. Default is `off`. Applies to top-level group only.|
| `streaming_mode` | Enables/disables streaming of large transactions. When set to `off`, streaming is disabled. When set to any other value, large transactions are decoded while they're still in progress, and the changes are sent to the downstream. If the value is set to `file`, then the incoming changes of streaming transactions are stored in a file and applied only after the transaction is committed on upstream. If the value is set to `writer`, then the incoming changes are directly sent to one of the writers, if available. If parallel apply is disabled or no writer is free to handle streaming transaction, then the changes are written to a file and applied after the transaction is committed. If the value is set to `auto`, PGD tries to intelligently pick between `file` and `writer`, depending on the transaction property and available resources. You can't enable `streaming_mode` if the WAL decoder is already enabled.<br/><br/>For more details, see [Transaction streaming](../transaction-streaming). Applies to top-level group only.|
| `default_commit_scope` | The commit scope to use by default, initially the `local` commit scope. This parameter applies only to the top-level node group. You can use individual rules for different origin groups of the same commit scope. See [Origin groups](../durability/commit-scopes/#origin-groups) for more details. |

### Notes

This function passes a request to the group consensus mechanism to change
the defaults. The changes made are replicated globally using the consensus
mechanism.

The function isn't transactional. The request is processed in the background
so you can't roll back the function call. Also, the changes might not be
immediately visible to the current transaction.

This function doesn't hold any locks.
