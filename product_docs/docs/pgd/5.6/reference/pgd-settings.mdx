You can set PGD-specific configuration settings. Unless noted otherwise,
you can set the values at any time.

## Conflict handling

### `bdr.default_conflict_detection`

Sets the default conflict detection method for newly created tables. Accepts
same values as
[bdr.alter_table_conflict_detection()](conflict_functions/#bdralter_table_conflict_detection).

## Global sequence parameters

### `bdr.default_sequence_kind`

Sets the default [sequence kind](../sequences).

The default is `distributed`, which means `snowflakeid` is used for `int8`
sequences (that is, `bigserial`) and `galloc` sequence for `int4` (that is, `serial`)
and `int2` sequences.

## DDL handling

### `bdr.default_replica_identity`

Sets the default value for `REPLICA IDENTITY` on newly created tables. The
`REPLICA IDENTITY` defines the information written to the write-ahead log to
identify rows that are updated or deleted.

The accepted values are:

| Value | Description |
|---|---|
| `default` | Records the old values of the columns of the primary key, if any (this is the default PostgreSQL behavior). |
| `full` | Records the old values of all columns in the row. |
| `nothing` | Records no information about the old row. |
| `auto` | Tables with PK are created with REPLICA IDENTITY DEFAULT, and tables without PK are created with REPLICA IDENTITY FULL. This is the default PGD behavior. |

See the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altertable.html#SQL-CREATETABLE-REPLICA-IDENTITY) for more details.

PGD can't replicate `UPDATE` and `DELETE` operations on tables without a
`PRIMARY KEY` or `UNIQUE` constraint. The exception is when the replica identity
for the table is `FULL`, either by table-specific configuration or by
`bdr.default_replica_identity`.

If `bdr.default_replica_identity` is `default` and there is a `UNIQUE`
constraint included in the table definition, it won't be automatically picked up as `REPLICA IDENTITY`.
You need to set the `REPLICA IDENTITY` explicitly using `ALTER TABLE ... REPLICA IDENTITY ...`.

Setting the replica identity of tables to `full` increases the volume of
WAL written and the amount of data replicated on the wire for the table.

!!! warning On setting bdr.default_replica_identity to default
When setting `bdr.default_replica_identity` to `default` using `ALTER SYSTEM`,
always quote the value, like this:
```sql
ALTER SYSTEM SET bdr.default_replica_identity="default";
```
You need to include the quotes because default, unquoted, is a special value to the [ALTER SYSTEM](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-altersystem.html) command that triggers the removal of the setting from the configuration file. When the setting is removed, the system uses the PGD default setting, which is `auto`.
!!!

### `bdr.ddl_replication`

Automatically replicates DDL across nodes (default is `on`).

This parameter can be set only by bdr_superuser or superuser roles.

Running DDL or calling PGD administration functions with `bdr.ddl_replication =
off` can create situations where replication stops until an administrator can
intervene. See [DDL replication](../ddl) for details.

A `LOG`-level log message is emitted to the PostgreSQL server logs whenever
`bdr.ddl_replication` is set to `off`. Additionally, a `WARNING-level` message
is written whenever replication of captured DDL commands or PGD replication
functions is skipped due to this setting.

### `bdr.role_replication`

Automatically replicates ROLE commands across nodes (default is `on`). Only a
superuser can set this parameter. This setting works only if
`bdr.ddl_replication` is turned on as well.

Turning this parameter off without using external methods to ensure roles are in sync
across all nodes might cause replicated DDL to interrupt replication until the
administrator intervenes.

See [Role manipulation statements](../ddl/ddl-role-manipulation.mdx)
for details.

### `bdr.ddl_locking`

Configures the operation mode of global locking for DDL.

This parameter can be set only by bdr_superuser or superuser roles.

Possible options are:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `all` | Use global locking for all DDL operations. (Default) |
| `dml` | Use global locking only for DDL operations that need to prevent writes by taking the global DML lock for a relation. |
| `off` | Don't use global locking for DDL operations. |

Default is `all`.

A `LOG`-level log message is emitted to the PostgreSQL server logs whenever
`bdr.ddl_replication` is set to `off`. Additionally, a `WARNING` message is
written whenever any global locking steps are skipped due to this setting. It's
normal for some statements to result in two `WARNING` messages: one for skipping
the DML lock and one for skipping the DDL lock.

For backward compatibility, `bdr.ddl_locking` supports aliases. 
`on` and `true` are an alias for `all`. 
`false` is an alias for `off`. 

See also [Global locking](#global-locking).

### `bdr.truncate_locking` 

Sets the TRUNCATE command's locking behavior (default is `off`).
When `true`, TRUNCATE obeys the `bdr.ddl_locking` setting.

## Global locking

DDL locking is controlled by [`bdr.ddl_locking`](#bdrddl_locking). Other global
locking settings include the following.

### `bdr.global_lock_max_locks`

Sets the maximum number of global locks that can be held on a node (default is
1000). Can be set only at Postgres server start.

### `bdr.global_lock_timeout`

Sets the maximum allowed duration of any wait for a global lock (default is 10
minutes). A value of zero disables this timeout.

### `bdr.global_lock_statement_timeout`

Sets the maximum allowed duration of any statement holding a global lock
(default is 60 minutes). A value of zero disables this timeout.

### `bdr.global_lock_idle_timeout` 

Sets the maximum allowed duration of idle time in a transaction holding a global
lock (default is 10 minutes). A value of zero disables this timeout.

### `bdr.lock_table_locking`

Sets locking behavior for LOCK TABLE statement (default is off). When enabled, LOCK TABLE statement also takes a global DML lock on the cluster, blocking other locking statements. 

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `on` | Use global locking for all table locks. |
| `off` | Don't use global locking for table locks. (Default) |

### `bdr.predictive_checks` 

Sets the log level for predictive checks (currently used only by global locks).
Can be `DEBUG`, `LOG`, `WARNING` (default), or `ERROR`. Predictive checks are
early validations for expected cluster state when doing certain operations. You
can use them for those operations for fail early rather than wait for timeouts.
In global lock terms, PGD checks that there are enough nodes connected and
withing reasonable lag limit for getting the quorum needed by the global lock.

## Node management

### `bdr.replay_progress_frequency`

Sets the interval for sending replication position info to the rest of the
cluster (default is 1 minute).

### `bdr.standby_slot_names`

Sets the slots required to receive and confirm replication changes before any
other ones. This setting is useful primarily when using physical standbys for
failover or when using subscribe-only nodes.

## Generic replication

### `bdr.writers_per_subscription`

Sets the default number of writers per subscription. (In PGD, you can also change
this with `bdr.alter_node_group_config` for a group.)

### `bdr.max_writers_per_subscription`

Maximum number of writers per subscription (sets upper limit for the `bdr.writers_per_subscription` setting).

### `bdr.xact_replication` 

Replicates current transaction (default is `on`).

Turning this off makes the whole transaction local only, which
means the transaction isn't visible to logical decoding by
PGD and all other downstream targets of logical decoding. Data isn't
transferred to any other node, including logical standby nodes.

This parameter can be set only by the bdr_superuser or superuser roles.

This parameter can be set only inside the current transaction using the
`SET LOCAL` command unless `bdr.permit_unsafe_commands = on`.

!!! Note
    Even with transaction replication disabled, WAL is generated,
    but those changes are filtered away on the origin.

!!! Warning
    Turning off `bdr.xact_replication` leads to data
    inconsistency between nodes. Use it only to recover from
    data divergence between nodes or in
    replication situations where changes on single nodes are required for
    replication to continue. Use at your own risk.

### `bdr.permit_unsafe_commands`

Overrides safety check on commands that are deemed unsafe for general use.

Requires bdr_superuser or PostgreSQL superuser.

!!! Warning
    The commands that are normally not considered safe can either
    produce inconsistent results or break replication altogether. Use at your
    own risk.

### `bdr.batch_inserts`

Number of consecutive inserts to one table in a single transaction that turns on
batch processing of inserts for that table.

This setting allows replication of large data loads as COPY internally, rather
than as a set of inserts. It's also how the initial data during node join is copied.

### `bdr.maximum_clock_skew`

Specifies the maximum difference between
the incoming transaction commit timestamp and the current time on the
subscriber before triggering `bdr.maximum_clock_skew_action`.

It checks if the timestamp of the currently replayed transaction is in the
future compared to the current time on the subscriber. If it is, and the
difference is larger than `bdr.maximum_clock_skew`, it performs the action
specified by the `bdr.maximum_clock_skew_action` setting.

The default is `-1`, which means ignore clock skew (the check is turned
off). It's valid to set 0 as when the clocks on all servers are synchronized.
The fact that the transaction is being replayed means it was committed in
the past.

### `bdr.maximum_clock_skew_action`

Specifies the action to take if a clock skew higher than
`bdr.maximum_clock_skew` is detected.

There are two possible values for this setting:

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `WARN` | Log a warning about this fact. The warnings are logged once per minute at the maximum to prevent flooding the server log. |
| `WAIT` | Wait until the current local timestamp is no longer older than remote commit timestamp minus the `bdr.maximum_clock_skew`. |

### `bdr.accept_connections` 

Enables or disables connections to PGD (default is `on`).

Requires bdr_superuser or PostgreSQL superuser.

### `bdr.standby_slot_names`

This setting is typically used in failover configurations to ensure that the
failover-candidates streaming physical replicas for this PGD node have received
and flushed all changes before they ever become visible to subscribers. That
guarantees that a commit can't vanish on failover to a standby for the provider.

Replication slots whose names are listed in the comma-separated
`bdr.standby_slot_names` list are treated specially by the WAL sender on a PGD
node.

PGD's logical replication WAL senders ensure that all local changes are sent and
flushed to the replication slots in `bdr.standby_slot_names` before the node
sends those changes to any other PGD replication clients. Effectively, it
provides a synchronous replication barrier between the named list of slots and
all other replication clients.

Any replication slot can be listed in `bdr.standby_slot_names`. Both logical and
physical slots work, but it's generally used for physical slots.

Without this safeguard, two anomalies are possible where a commit can be
received by a subscriber and then vanish from the provider on failover because
the failover candidate hadn't received it yet:

-   For 1+ subscribers, the subscriber might have applied the change but the new
    provider might execute new transactions that conflict with the received change,
    as it never happened as far as the provider is concerned.

-   For 2+ subscribers, at the time of failover, not all subscribers have applied
    the change. The subscribers now have inconsistent and irreconcilable states
    because the subscribers that didn't receive the commit have no way to get it.

Setting `bdr.standby_slot_names` by design causes other subscribers not listed
in there to lag behind the provider if the required number of listed nodes are
not keeping up. Monitoring is thus essential.

Another use case where `bdr.standby_slot_names` is useful is when using a
subscriber-only node, to ensure that it doesn't move ahead of any of the
regular PGD nodes. This can best be achieved by listing the logical slots of all
regular PGD peer nodes in combination with setting
`bdr.standby_slots_min_confirmed` to at least 1.

### `bdr.standby_slots_min_confirmed`

Controls how many of the `bdr.standby_slot_names` have to confirm before
sending data to PGD subscribers.

### `bdr.writer_input_queue_size`

Specifies the size of the shared memory queue used by the receiver
to send data to the writer process. If the writer process is stalled or making
slow progress, then the queue might get filled up, stalling the receiver process
too. So it's important to provide enough shared memory for this queue. The
default is 1 MB, and the maximum allowed size is 1 GB. While any storage size
specifier can be used to set the GUC, the default is KB.

### `bdr.writer_output_queue_size`

Specifies the size of the shared memory queue used by the receiver
to receive data from the writer process. Since the writer isn't expected to send
a large amount of data, a relatively smaller sized queue is enough. The default
is 32 KB, and the maximum allowed size is 1 MB. While any storage size specifier
can be used to set the GUC, the default is KB.

### `bdr.min_worker_backoff_delay`

Allows for rate limiting of PGD background worker launches by
preventing a given worker from being relaunched more often than every
`bdr.min_worker_backoff_delay` milliseconds. On repeated errors, the backoff
increases exponentially with added jitter up to a maximum of
`bdr.max_worker_backoff_delay`.

Time-unit suffixes are supported.

!!! Note
    This setting currently affects only receiver worker, which means it
    primarily affects how fast a subscription tries to reconnect on error
    or connection failure.

The default for `bdr.min_worker_backoff_delay` is 1 second. For
`bdr.max_worker_backoff_delay`, it's 1 minute.

If the backoff delay setting is changed and the PostgreSQL configuration is
reloaded, then all current backoffs wait for reset. Additionally, the
`bdr.worker_task_reset_backoff_all()` function is provided to allow the
administrator to force all backoff intervals to immediately expire.

A tracking table in shared memory is maintained to remember the last launch
time of each type of worker. This tracking table isn't persistent. It's
cleared by PostgreSQL restarts, including soft restarts during crash recovery
after an unclean backend exit.

You can use the view [`bdr.worker_tasks`](catalogs-visible#bdrworker_tasks) to
inspect this state so the administrator can see any backoff rate limiting
currently in effect.

For rate-limiting purposes, workers are classified by task. This key consists of
the worker role, database OID, subscription ID, subscription writer ID,
extension library name and function name, extension-supplied worker name, and
the remote relation ID for sync writers. `NULL` is used where a given classifier
doesn't apply, for example, when manager workers don't have a subscription ID and
receivers don't have a writer ID.

## CRDTs

### `bdr.crdt_raw_value` 

Sets the output format of [CRDT data types](../conflict-management/crdt).

The default output (when this setting is `off`) is to return only the current
value of the base CRDT type, for example, a bigint for `crdt_pncounter`.
When set to `on`, the returned value represents the full representation of
the CRDT value, which can, for example, include the state from multiple nodes.

## Commit scope

### `bdr.commit_scope`

Sets the current (or default) [commit scope](../commit-scopes/commit-scopes) (default
is an empty string).

## Commit At Most Once

### `bdr.camo_local_mode_delay`

The commit delay that applies in CAMO's asynchronous mode to emulate the
overhead that normally occurs with the CAMO partner having to confirm
transactions (default is 5 ms). Set to `0` to disable this feature.

### `bdr.camo_enable_client_warnings` 

Emits warnings if an activity is carried out in the database for which CAMO
properties can't be guaranteed (default is enabled). Well-informed users
can choose to disable this setting to reduce the amount of warnings going into their
logs.

## Transaction streaming

### `bdr.default_streaming_mode`

Controls transaction streaming by the subscriber node. Possible values
are: `off`, `writer`, `file`, and `auto`. Defaults to `auto`. If set to `off`,
the subscriber doesn't request transaction streaming. If set to one of the other
values, the subscriber requests transaction streaming and the publisher provides
it if it supports them and if configured at group level. For more details, see
[Transaction streaming](../transaction-streaming).

## Lag Control

### `bdr.lag_control_max_commit_delay`

Maximum acceptable post-commit delay that can be tolerated, in fractional milliseconds.

### `bdr.lag_control_max_lag_size` 

Maximum acceptable lag size that can be tolerated, in kilobytes.


### `bdr.lag_control_max_lag_time`

Maximum acceptable lag time that can be tolerated, in milliseconds.

### `bdr.lag_control_min_conforming_nodes`

Minimum number of nodes required to stay below acceptable lag measures.

### `bdr.lag_control_commit_delay_adjust`

Commit delay micro adjustment measured as a fraction of the maximum commit delay
time. At a default value of 0.01%, it takes 100 net increments to reach the
maximum commit delay.

### `bdr.lag_control_sample_interval`

Minimum time between lag samples and commit delay micro adjustments, in milliseconds.

### `bdr.lag_control_commit_delay_start`

The lag threshold at which commit delay increments start to be applied,
expressed as a fraction of acceptable lag measures. At a default value of 1.0%,
commit delay increments don't begin until acceptable lag measures are breached.

By setting a smaller fraction, it might be possible to prevent a breach by
"bending the lag curve" earlier so that it's asymptotic with the acceptable lag
measure.

## Timestamp-based snapshots

### `bdr.timestamp_snapshot_keep`

Time to keep valid snapshots for the timestamp-based snapshot use (default is
`0`, meaning don't keep past snapshots).

## Monitoring and logging

### `bdr.debug_level`

Defines the log level that PGD uses to write its debug messages. The default
value is `debug2`. If you want to see detailed PGD debug output, set
`bdr.debug_level = 'log'`.

### `bdr.trace_level` 

Similar to `bdr.debug_level`, defines the log level to use for PGD trace messages.
Enabling tracing on all nodes of an EDB Postgres Distributed cluster might help
EDB Support to diagnose issues. You can set this parameter only at Postgres server start.

!!! Warning
Setting `bdr.debug_level` or `bdr.trace_level` to a value >=
`log_min_messages` can produce a very large volume of log output. Don't
enabled it long term in production unless plans are in place for log filtering,
archival, and rotation to prevent disk space exhaustion.
!!!

### `bdr.track_subscription_apply`

Tracks apply statistics for each subscription with [`bdr.stat_subscription`](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-visible#bdrstat_subscription) (default is `on`).

### `bdr.track_relation_apply`

Tracks apply statistics for each relation with [`bdr.stat_relation`](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-visible#bdrstat_relation) (default is `off`).

### `bdr.track_apply_lock_timing`

Tracks lock timing when tracking statistics for relations with [`bdr.stat_relation`](/pgd/latest/reference/catalogs-visible#bdrstat_relation) (default is `off`).

## Decoding worker

### `bdr.enable_wal_decoder`

Enables logical change record (LCR) sending on a single node with a [decoding worker](../node_management/decoding_worker/) (default is false). When set to true, a decoding worker process starts, and WAL senders send the LCRs it produces. If set back to false, any WAL senders using LCR are restarted and use the WAL directly.

!!! Note 
You also need to enable this setting on all nodes in the PGD group and
set the `enable_wal_decoder` option to true on the group. 
!!!

### `bdr.receive_lcr`

When subscribing to another node, this setting enables the node to request the
use of logical change records (LCRs) for the subscription (default is false).
When this setting is true on a downstream node, the node
requests that upstream nodes use LCRs when sending to it. If you set
`bdr.enable_wal_decoder` to true on a node, also set this setting to true.

!!! Note 
You also need to enable this setting on all nodes in the PGD group and
set the `enable_wal_decoder` option to true on the group. 
!!!

### `bdr.lcr_cleanup_interval`

Logical change record (LCR) file cleanup interval (default is 3 minutes). When the [decoding worker](../node_management/decoding_worker/) is enabled, the decoding worker stores LCR files as a buffer. These files are periodically cleaned, and this setting controls the interval between any two consecutive cleanups. Setting it to zero disables cleanup.

## Connectivity settings

The following are a set of connectivity settings affecting all cross-node
`libpq` connections. The defaults are set to fairly conservative values and
cover most production needs. All variables have `SIGHUP` context, meaning
changes are applied upon reload.

### `bdr.global_connection_timeout`

Maximum time to wait while connecting, in seconds (default is 15 seconds). Write as a decimal integer,
for example, 10. Zero, negative, or not specified means wait indefinitely. The
minimum allowed timeout is 2 seconds, therefore a value of 1 is interpreted as
2. 

### `bdr.global_keepalives`

Controls whether TCP keepalives are used (default is 1, meaning on). If
you don't want keepalives, you can change this to 0, meaning off. This parameter
is ignored for connections made by a Unix-domain socket.

### `bdr.global_keepalives_idle`

Controls the number of seconds of inactivity after which TCP sends a keepalive
message to the server (default is 1 second). A value of zero uses the system default. This parameter
is ignored for connections made by a Unix-domain socket or if keepalives are
disabled. It's supported only on systems where `TCP_KEEPIDLE` or an equivalent
socket option is available. On other systems, it has no effect.

### `bdr.global_keepalives_interval`

Controls the number of seconds after which to retransmit a TCP keepalive message
that isn't acknowledged by the server (default is 2 seconds). A value of zero uses the system default.
This parameter is ignored for connections made by a Unix-domain socket or if
keepalives are disabled. It's supported only on systems where `TCP_KEEPINTVL` or
an equivalent socket option is available. On other systems, it has no effect.

### `bdr.global_keepalives_count`

Controls the number of TCP keepalives that can be lost before the client's
connection to the server is considered dead (default is 3). A value of zero uses the system
default. This parameter is ignored for connections made by a Unix-domain socket
or if keepalives are disabled. It's supported only on systems where
`TCP_KEEPCNT` or an equivalent socket option is available. On other systems, it
has no effect.

### `bdr.global_tcp_user_timeout`

Controls the number of milliseconds that transmitted data can remain
unacknowledged before a connection is forcibly closed  (default is 5000, that is, 5 seconds). 
A value of zero uses the
system default. This parameter is ignored for connections made by a Unix-domain
socket. It's supported only on systems where `TCP_USER_TIMEOUT` is available. On
other systems, it has no effect.

## Internal settings - Raft timeouts
 
### `bdr.raft_global_election_timeout`

To account for network failures, the Raft consensus protocol implements timeouts
for elections and requests. This value is used when a request is
being sent to the global (top-level) group. The default is 6 seconds (6s).

### `bdr.raft_group_election_timeout`

To account for network failures, the Raft consensus protocol implements timeouts
for elections and requests. This value is used when a request is
being sent to the sub-group. The default is 3 seconds (3s).

### `bdr.raft_response_timeout`

For responses, the settings of
[`bdr.raft_global_election_timeout`](#bdrraft_global_election_timeout) and
[`bdr.raft_group_election_timeout`](#bdrraft_group_election_timeout) are used
as appropriate. You can override this behavior by setting
this variable. The setting of `bdr.raft_response_timeout` must be less than
either of the election timeout values. Set this variable to -1 to disable the override.
The default is -1.

## Internal settings - Other Raft values

### `bdr.raft_keep_min_entries`

The minimum number of entries to keep in the Raft log when doing log compaction
(default is `1000`; PGD 5.3 and earlier: `100`). The value of `0` disables log
compaction. You can set this parameter only at Postgres server start.

!!! Warning
If log compaction is disabled, the log grows in size forever.
!!!

### `bdr.raft_log_min_apply_duration`

To move the state machine forward, Raft appends entries to its internal log.
During normal operation, appending takes only a few milliseconds. This poses an
upper threshold on the duration of that append action, above which an `INFO`
message is logged. This can indicate a problem. Default
is 3000 ms.

### `bdr.raft_log_min_message_duration`

When to log a consensus request. Measures roundtrip time of a PGD consensus
request and logs an `INFO` message if the time exceeds this parameter (default is 5000 ms).

### `bdr.raft_group_max_connections`

The maximum number of connections across all PGD groups for a Postgres server (default is 100 connections).
These connections carry PGD consensus requests between the groups' nodes.
You can set this parameter only at Postgres server start.

## Internal settings - Other values

### `bdr.backwards_compatibility`

Specifies the version to be backward compatible to, in the same numerical format
as used by `bdr.bdr_version_num`, for example, `30618`. (Default is the
current PGD version.) Enables exact behavior of a
former PGD version, even if this has generally unwanted effects. 
Since this changes from release to release, we advise
against explicit use in the configuration file unless the value is different
from the current version.

### `bdr.track_replication_estimates`

Tracks replication estimates in terms of apply rates and catchup intervals for
peer nodes. Protocols like CAMO can use this information to estimate the
readiness of a peer node. This parameter is enabled by default.

### `bdr.lag_tracker_apply_rate_weight`

PGD monitors how far behind peer nodes are in terms of applying WAL from the local
node and calculate a moving average of the apply rates for the lag tracking.
This parameter specifies how much contribution newer calculated values have in
this moving average calculation. Default is 0.1.

### `bdr.enable_auto_sync_reconcile`

When enabled, nodes perform automatic synchronization of data from a node that is furthest ahead with respect to the down node. Default (from 5.5.1) is off.
