The following are internal system functions. Many are used when creating various views. We recommend that you do not use the functions directly but instead use the views that they serve.

## General internal functions

### `bdr.bdr_get_commit_decisions`

Convenience routine to inspect shared memory state.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.bdr_get_commit_decisions(dbid OID,
            origin_node_id OID,
            origin_xid xid,
            local_xid xid,
            decision "char",
            decision_ts timestamptz,
            is_camo boolean)
```

### `bdr.bdr_track_commit_decision`

Save the transaction commit status in the shared memory hash table.
This dunction is used by the upgrade scripts to transfer commit decisions
saved in bdr.node_pre_commit catalog to the shared memory hash table.
The transaction commit status will also be logged to the WAL and hence can be reloaded from
WAL.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.bdr_track_commit_decision(OID, xid, xid, "char", timestamptz, boolean);
```


### `bdr.consensus_kv_fetch`

Fetch value from the consistent KV Store in JSON format.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.consensus_kv_fetch(IN key text) RETURNS jsonb
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description                  |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| `key`     | An arbitrary key to fetch.   |

#### Notes

This function is an internal function, mainly used by HARP.

!!! Warning
    Don't use this function in user applications.

### `bdr.consensus_kv_store`

Stores value in the consistent KV Store.

Returns the timestamp of the value expiration time. This function depends on `ttl`. If `ttl`
is `NULL`, then this function returns `infinity`. If the value was deleted, it
returns `-infinity`.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.consensus_kv_store(key text, value jsonb,
        prev_value jsonb DEFAULT NULL, ttl int DEFAULT NULL)
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter   | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `key`       | An arbitrary unique key to insert, update, or delete.                       |
| `value`     | JSON value to store. If NULL, any existing record is deleted.               |
| `prev_value`| If set, the write operation is done only if the current value is equal to `prev_value`. |
| `ttl`       | Time-to-live of the new value, in milliseconds.                             |

#### Notes

This is an internal function, mainly used by HARP.

!!! Warning
    Don't use this function in user applications.

### `bdr.decode_message_payload`

PGD message payload function that decodes the payloads of consensus messages to a more human-readable output. Used primarily by the `bdr.global_consensus_journal_details` debug view.

### `bdr.decode_message_response_payload`

PGD message payload function that decodes the payloads of responses to consensus messages to a more human-readable output. Used primarily by the `bdr.global_consensus_journal_details` debug view.

### `bdr.difference_fix_origin_create`

Creates a replication origin with a given name passed as an argument but adding a `bdr_` prefix.
Returns the internal id of the origin. This function has the same functionality
as `pg_replication_origin_create()` except this function requires bdr_superuser
rather than postgres superuser permissions.

### `bdr.difference_fix_session_reset`

Marks the current session as not replaying from any origin, essentially
resetting the effect of `bdr.difference_fix_session_setup()`.
It returns void. This function has the same functionality as
`pg_replication_origin_session_reset()` except this function requires
bdr_superuser rather than postgres superuser permissions.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.difference_fix_session_reset()
```

### `bdr.difference_fix_session_setup`

Marks the current session as replaying from the current origin.
The function uses the pre-created `bdr_local_only_origin` local
replication origin implicitly for the session. It allows replay
progress to be reported and returns void. This function has the
same functionality as `pg_replication_origin_session_setup()`
except that this function requires bdr_superuser rather than postgres
superuser permissions. The earlier form of the function,
`bdr.difference_fix_session_setup(text)`, was deprecated and will be
removed in a future release.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.difference_fix_session_setup()
```

### `bdr.difference_fix_xact_set_avoid_conflict`

Marks the current transaction as replaying a transaction that
committed at LSN '0/0' and timestamp '2000-01-01'. This function has
the same functionality as
`pg_replication_origin_xact_setup('0/0', '2000-01-01')`
except this function requires bdr_superuser rather than postgres superuser
permissions.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.difference_fix_xact_set_avoid_conflict()
```

### `bdr.drop_node`

Drops a node's metadata.

This function removes the metadata for a given node from the local
database. The node can be either:

-   The local node, in which case it removes all the node metadata, including information about remote nodes.
-   A remote node, in which case it removes only metadata for that specific node.



!!! Important When to use `bdr.drop_node()`
Do not use `bdr.drop_node()` to drop node metadata and reuse node names. PGD can reuse existing node names providing the node name belongs to a node in a `PARTED` state. Use `bdr.part_node()` to remove the original node and place it in a `PARTED` state.

Use of this internal function is limited to:

* When you're instructed to by EDB Technical Support.
* Where you're specifically instructed to in the documentation.

Use [`bdr.part_node`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrpart_node) to remove a node from a PGD group. That function sets the node to `PARTED` state and enables reuse of the node name.

!!!

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.drop_node(node_name text, cascade boolean DEFAULT false, force boolean DEFAULT false)
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter   | Description                                                                 |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `node_name` | Name of an existing node.                                                   |
| `cascade`   | Deprecated, will be removed in a future release.                            |
| `force`     | Circumvents all sanity checks and forces the removal of all metadata for the given PGD node despite a possible danger of causing inconsistencies. Only Technical Support uses a forced node drop in case of emergencies related to parting. |

#### Notes

Before you run this function, part the node using `bdr.part_node()`.

This function removes metadata for a given node from the local database. The node
can be the local node, in which case all the node metadata is removed,
including information about remote nodes. Or it can be the remote node, in
which case only metadata for that specific node is removed.

!!! Note
    PGD can have a maximum of 1024 node records (both ACTIVE and PARTED)
    at one time because each node has a unique sequence number
    assigned to it, for use by snowflakeid and timeshard sequences.
    PARTED nodes aren't automatically cleaned up. If this
    becomes a problem, you can use this function to remove those records.

### `bdr.get_global_locks`

Shows information about global locks held on the local node.

Used to implement the `bdr.global_locks` view to provide a more detailed
overview of the locks.

### `bdr.get_node_conflict_resolvers`

Displays a text string of all the conflict resolvers on the local node.

### `bdr.get_slot_flush_timestamp`

Retrieves the timestamp of the last flush position confirmation for a given
replication slot.

Used internally to implement the `bdr.node_slots` view.

### `bdr.internal_alter_sequence_set_kind`

No longer used by the current version of PGD. Exists only for backward
compatibility during rolling upgrades.

### `bdr.internal_replication_set_add_table`

A function previously used internally for replication of the various function calls.
No longer used by the current version of PGD. Exists only for backward
compatibility during rolling upgrades.

### `bdr.internal_replication_set_remove_table`

No longer used by the current version of PGD. Exists only for backward
compatibility during rolling upgrades.

### `bdr.internal_submit_join_request`

Submits a consensus request for joining a new node.

Needed by the PGD group reconfiguration internal mechanisms.

### `bdr.isolation_test_session_is_blocked`

A helper function, extending (and actually invoking) the original
`pg_isolation_test_session_is_blocked` with an added check for blocks
on global locks.

Used for isolation/concurrency tests.

### `bdr.local_node_info`

Displays information for the local node needed by the PGD group
reconfiguration internal mechanisms.

The view `bdr.local_node_summary` provides similar information useful for
user consumption.

### `bdr.msgb_connect`

Connects to the connection pooler of another node.
Used by the consensus protocol.

### `bdr.msgb_deliver_message`

Sends messages to another node's connection pooler.
Used by the consensus protocol.

### `bdr.node_catchup_state_name`

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.node_catchup_state_name(catchup_state oid);
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter       | Description                          |

| `catchup_state` | Oid code of the catchup state.       |

### `bdr.node_kind_name`

Returns human-friendly name of the node kind (data|standby|witness|subscriber-only).

### `bdr.peer_state_name`

Transforms the node state (`node_state`) into a textual
representation. Used mainly to implement the `bdr.node_summary` view.

### `bdr.pg_xact_origin`

Returns the origin id of a given transaction.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.pg_xact_origin(xmin xid)
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description                           |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| `xid`     | Transaction id whose origin is returned. |

### `bdr.request_replay_progress_update`

Requests the immediate writing of a 'replay progress update' Raft message.
Used mainly for test purposes but can also be used to test if the
consensus mechanism is working.

### `bdr.reset_relation_stats`

Returns a Boolean result after resetting the relation stats,
as viewed by `bdr.stat_relation`.

### `bdr.reset_subscription_stats`

Returns a Boolean result after resetting the statistics created by subscriptions,
as viewed by `bdr.stat_subscription`.

### `bdr.resynchronize_table_from_node`

Resynchronizes the relation from a remote node.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.resynchronize_table_from_node(node_name name, relation regclass)
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter   | Description                                              |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `node_name` | The node from which to copy or resync the relation data. |
| `relation`  | The relation to copy from the remote node.               |

#### Notes

This function acquires a global DML lock on the relation, truncates the relation
locally, and copies data into it from the remote node.

The relation must exist on both nodes with the same name and definition.

The following are supported:

-  Resynchronizing partitioned tables with identical partition definitions
-  Resynchronizing partitioned table to nonpartitioned table and vice versa
-  Resynchronizing referenced tables by temporarily dropping and re-creating
foreign key constraints

After running the function on a referenced table, if the referenced column
data no longer matches the referencing column values, the function throws an error.
After resynchronizing the referencing table data, rerun the function.

Furthermore, it supports resynchronization of tables with generated columns by
computing the generated column values locally after copying the data from
remote node.

Currently, row_filters are ignored by this function.

The `bdr.resynchronize_table_from_node` function can be executed only by
the owner of the table, provided the owner has bdr_superuser privileges.

### `bdr.seq_currval`

Part of the internal implementation of global sequence manipulation.

Invoked automatically when `currval()` is called on a galloc or snowflakeid sequence.

### `bdr.seq_lastval`

Part of the internal implementation of global sequence manipulation.

Invoked automatically when `lastval()` is called on a galloc or snowflakeid sequence.

### `bdr.seq_nextval`

Part of the internal implementation of global sequence increments.

Invoked automatically when `nextval()` is called on a galloc or snowflakeid sequence

### `bdr.show_subscription_status`

Retrieves information about the subscription status. Used mainly to
implement the `bdr.subscription_summary` view.

### `bdr.show_workers`

Information related to the bdr workers.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.show_workers(
    worker_pid int,
    worker_role int,
    worker_role_name text,
    worker_subid oid)
```

### `bdr.show_writers`

Function used in the `bdr.writers` view.

### `bdr.sync_status_name`

Converts sync state code into a textual representation.
Used mainly to implement the [`bdr.sync_node_requests_summary`](catalogs-internal#bdrsync_node_requests_summary)
view.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.sync_status_name(sync_state oid)
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter    | Description                   |
|--------------|-------------------------------|
| `sync_state` | Oid code of the sync state.   |

## Task manager functions

### `bdr.taskmgr_set_leader`

Requests the given `node` to be the task manager leader node. The leader
node is responsible for creating new tasks. (Currently only autopartition
makes use of this facility.) A witness node, a logical standby, or a
subscriber-only node can't become a leader. Such requests will fail with
an error.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.taskmgr_set_leader(node name, wait_for_completion boolean DEFAULT true);
```

### `bdr.taskmgr_get_last_completed_workitem`

Return the `id` of the last workitem successfully completed on all nodes in the
cluster.

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.taskmgr_get_last_completed_workitem();
```

### `bdr.taskmgr_work_queue_check_status`

Lets you see the status of the background workers 
that are doing their job to generate and finish the tasks.

The status can be seen through these views:

- `bdr.taskmgr_work_queue_local_status`
- `bdr.taskmgr_work_queue_global_status`

#### Synopsis

```sql
bdr.taskmgr_work_queue_check_status(workid bigint
                           local boolean DEFAULT false);
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Description                  |
|-----------|------------------------------|
| `workid`  | The key of the task.         |
| `local`   | Check the local status only. |

#### Notes

Taskmgr workers are always running in the background, even before the
`bdr.autopartition` function is called for the first time. If an invalid
`workid` is used, the function returns `unknown`. `In-progress` is the typical status.
