EDB Postgres Distributed can be deployed with three different Postgres distributions: PostgreSQL, EDB Postgres Extended Server, or EDB Postgres Advanced Server. The availability of particular EDB Postgres Distributed features depends on the Postgres distribution being used. Therefore, it's essential to adopt the Postgres distribution best suited to your business needs. For example, if having the Commit At Most Once (CAMO) feature is mission critical to your use case, don't adopt open source PostgreSQL, which doesn't have the core capabilities required to handle CAMO.

The following table lists features of EDB Postgres Distributed that are dependent on the Postgres distribution and version.

| Feature                                         | PostgreSQL | EDB Postgres Extended | EDB Postgres Advanced |
