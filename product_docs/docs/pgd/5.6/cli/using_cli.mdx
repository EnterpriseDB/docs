## What is the PGD CLI?

The PGD CLI is a convenient way to connect to and manage your PGD cluster. To use it, you need a user with PGD superuser privileges or equivalent. The PGD user with superuser privileges is the [bdr_superuser role](../security). An example of an equivalent user is edb_admin on an EDB BigAnimal distributed high-availability cluster.

!!! Important Setting passwords
PGD CLI doesn't interactively prompt for your password. You must pass your password using one of the following methods:

 - Adding an entry to your [`.pgpass` password file](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-pgpass.html), which includes the host, port, database name, user name, and password.
 - Setting the password in the `PGPASSWORD` environment variable.
 - Including the password in the connection string.

We recommend the first option, as the other options don't scale well with multiple databases, or they compromise password confidentiality.
!!!

## Running the PGD CLI

Once you have [installed pgd-cli](installing), run the `pgd` command to access the PGD command line interface. The `pgd` command needs details about the host, port, and database to connect to, along with your username and password.

## Passing a database connection string

Use the `--dsn` flag to pass a database connection string to the `pgd` command. When you pass the connection string with the `--dsn` flag, you don't need a configuration file. The flag takes precedence even if a configuration file is present. For example:

```sh
pgd show-nodes --dsn "host=bdr-a1 port=5432 dbname=bdrdb user=enterprisedb"
```

See [pgd](command_ref) in the command reference for a description of the command options.

## Specifying a configuration file

If a `pgd-cli-config.yml` file is in `/etc/edb/pgd-cli` or `$HOME/.edb/pgd-cli`, `pgd` uses it. You can override
this behavior using the optional `-f` or `--config-file` flag. For example:

```sh
pgd show-nodes -f /opt/my-config.yml
Node             Node ID    Group          Type    Current State Target State Status Seq ID
----             -------    -----          ----    ------------- ------------ ------ ------
p-vjljj303dk-a-1 2573417965 p-vjljj303dk-a data    ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     1
p-vjljj303dk-a-2 126163807  p-vjljj303dk-a data    ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     2
p-vjljj303dk-a-3 3521351376 p-vjljj303dk-a witness ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     3
```


## Specifying the output format

Use the `-o` or `--output` flag to change the default output format to JSON or YAML. For example:

```sh
pgd show-nodes -o json
[
	{
		"node_id": 2573417965,
		"node_name": "p-vjljj303dk-a-1",
		"node_group_id": 4169125197,
		"node_group_name": "p-vjljj303dk-a",
		"node_kind_name": "data",
		"current_state": "ACTIVE",
		"target_state": "ACTIVE",
		"status": "Up",
		"node_seq_id": 1,
		"node_local_dbname": "bdrdb",
		"interface_connstr": "host=p-vjljj303dk-a-1-node.vmk31wilqpjeopka.biganimal.io user=streaming_replica sslmode=verify-full port=5432 sslkey=/controller/certificates/streaming_replica.key sslcert=/controller/certificates/streaming_replica.crt sslrootcert=/controller/certificates/server-ca.crt application_name=p-vjljj303dk-a-1 dbname=bdrdb",
		"route_priority": -1,
		"route_fence": false,
		"route_writes": true,
		"route_reads": true,
		"route_dsn": "host=p-vjljj303dk-a-1-node.vmk31wilqpjeopka.biganimal.io user=streaming_replica sslmode=verify-full port=5432 sslkey=/controller/certificates/streaming_replica.key sslcert=/controller/certificates/streaming_replica.crt sslrootcert=/controller/certificates/server-ca.crt application_name=p-vjljj303dk-a-1 dbname=bdrdb"
	},
...
]
```

The PGD CLI supports the following output formats.

| Setting | Format | Considerations |
| ------- | ------ | --------- |
|    none    | Tabular | Default format. This setting presents the data in tabular form.|
| `json`    | JSON | Presents the raw data with no formatting. For some commands, the JSON output might show more data than the tabular output, such as extra fields and more detailed messages. |
| `yaml`    | YAML | Similar to the JSON output but as YAML and with the fields ordered alphabetically. Experimental and might not be fully supported in future versions. |

## Accessing the command line help

To list the supported commands, enter:

```sh
pgd help
```

For help with a specific command and its parameters, enter `pgd help <command_name>`. For example:

```sh
pgd help show-nodes
```

!!! Note Avoiding stale data
The PGD CLI can return stale data on the state of the cluster if it's still connecting to nodes previously parted from the cluster. Edit the `pgd-cli-config.yml` file, or change your `--dsn` settings to ensure you are connecting to active nodes in the cluster.
