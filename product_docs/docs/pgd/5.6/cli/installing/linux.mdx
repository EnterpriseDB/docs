 PGD CLI is available for most Linux distributions. You can install it from the EDB repositories, which you can access with your EDB account. PGD users and BigAnimal users, including those on a free trial, have an EDB account and access to PGD CLI.

## Obtain your EDB subscription token

These repositories require a token to enable downloads from them. To obtain your token, log in to [EDB Repos 2.0](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads). If this is your first time visiting the EDB Repos 2.0 page, you must select **Request Access** to generate your token. Once a generated token is available, select the **Copy** icon to copy it to your clipboard, or select the eye icon to view it.

## Set the EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN environment variable
Once you have the token, execute the command shown for your operating system, substituting
your token for `<your-token>`. 

```
export EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

Then run the appropriate commands for your operating system.

## Install on Debian or Ubuntu

```bash
curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/postgres_distributed/setup.deb.sh" | sudo -E bash
```

If this command returns an error like `curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 404`, check that you entered the correct token.

When the command is successful, you'll see output like this:

```
Executing the  setup script for the 'enterprisedb/postgres_distributed' repository ...
...
```

You can now install the PGD CLI package using the command:

```
sudo apt-get install edb-pgd5-cli
```

## Install on RHEL, Rocky, AlmaLinux, or Oracle Linux

```bash
curl -1sSLf "https://downloads.enterprisedb.com/$EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN/postgres_distributed/setup.rpm.sh" | sudo -E bash
```

If this command returns an error like `curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 404`, check that you entered the correct token.

When the command is successful, you'll see output like this:

```
Executing the  setup script for the 'enterprisedb/postgres_distributed' repository ...
...
```

You can now install the PGD CLI package using the command:

```
sudo yum install edb-pgd5-cli
```
