Shows all groups in the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster and their summary.

### Synopsis

Shows all groups in the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster and their summary, including type, parent group, location, Raft and Routing status, Raft leader, and write leader.

In some cases when Raft isn't working properly or the group Raft leader isn't present, this command might show stale or incorrect write leader for that group.


```sh
pgd show-groups [flags]
```

### Options

No specific command options. See [global options](../command_ref#options-inherited-from-parent-commands) for generic options.

### Examples


#### Show all groups in the cluster

In this example, there is a 4 group cluster, 3 data groups and one subscriber-only group. `bdrgroup` is the global group. `group_a`, `group_b` and `group_c` are data groups. `group_so` is the subscriber-only group.

Note:
1. For write leader election both Raft and Routing options should be true for that group.
2. Raft is always true for global group.

```bash
$ pgd show-groups
