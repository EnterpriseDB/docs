title: show-nodes
---

Shows all nodes in the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster and their summary.

### Synopsis

Shows all nodes in the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster and their summary,
including name, node id, group, and current/target state.

Node States

* NONE: Node state is unset when the worker starts, expected to be set
quickly to the current known state.
* CREATED: bdr.create_node() has been executed, but the node is not a
member of any EDB Postgres Distributed cluster yet.
* JOIN_START: bdr.join_node_group() begins to join the local node to an
existing EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.
* JOINING: The node join has started and is currently at the initial sync
phase, creating the schema and data on the node.
* CATCHUP: Initial sync phase is completed; now the join is at the last step
of retrieving and applying transactions that were performed on the upstream
peer node since the join started.
* STANDBY:  Node join has finished, but not yet started to broadcast changes.
All joins spend some time in this state, but if defined as a Logical
Standby, the node will continue in this state.
* PROMOTE: Node was a logical standby and we just called bdr.promote_node to
move the node state to ACTIVE. These two PROMOTE states have to be
coherent to the fact, that only one node can be with a state higher than
STANDBY but lower than ACTIVE.
* PROMOTING: Promotion from logical standby to full BDR node is in progress.
* ACTIVE: The node is a full BDR node and is currently ACTIVE. This is the
most common node status.
* PART_START: Node was ACTIVE or STANDBY and we just called bdr.part_node
to remove the node from the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.
* PARTING: Node disconnects from other nodes and plays no further part in
consensus or replication.
* PART_CATCHUP: Non-parting nodes synchronize any missing data from the
recently parted node.
* PARTED: Node parting operation is now complete on all nodes.

Only one node at a time can be in either of the states PROMOTE or PROMOTING.

Note that the read-only state of a node, as shown in the Current State or in
the Target State columns, is indicated as STANDBY.

### Examples

```text

  Example 1 (3 node cluster, bdr-a1 and witness-a are up, bdr-a2 is down)

  $ pgd show-nodes

  Node      Node ID    Group   Type    Current State Target State Status      Seq ID
  ----      -------    -----   ----    ------------- ------------ ------      ------
  bdr-a1    3136956818 group_a data    ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up          1
  bdr-a2    2133699692 group_a data    ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Unreachable 2
  witness-a 3889635963 group_a witness ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up          3


  Example 2 (multi-group cluster with witness, logical standby and
  subscriber-only nodes)
  Note: In contrast to logical standby, the subscriber-only nodes are fully
  joined node to the cluster

  $ pgd show-nodes

  Node               Node ID    Group    Type            Current State Target State Status Seq ID

  bdr-a2             2133699692 group_a  data            ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     3

  witness-c          1954444188 group_c  witness         ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     4
  subscriber-only-c1 2448841809 group_so subscriber-only ACTIVE        ACTIVE       Up     8
