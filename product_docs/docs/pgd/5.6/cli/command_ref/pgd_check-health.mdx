title: check-health
deepToC: true
---

Checks the health of the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster.

### Synopsis

Performs various checks such as if all nodes are accessible and all
replication slots are working.

Please note that the current implementation of clock skew may return an
inaccurate skew value if the cluster is under high load while running this
command or has large number of nodes in it.

```sh
pgd check-health [flags]
```

### Options

No specific command options. See [global options](../command_ref#options-inherited-from-parent-commands) for generic options.

### Examples

#### Checking health with a node down

In this example, we have a 3 node cluster, bdr-a1 and bdr-c1 are up, bdr-b1 is down.

```bash
$ pgd check-health
__OUTPUT__
Check      Status   Message
-----      ------   -------
ClockSkew  Critical Clockskew cannot be determined for at least 1 BDR node pair
Connection Critical The node bdr-b1 is not accessible
Raft       Warning  There is at least 1 node that is not accessible
Replslots  Critical There is at least 1 BDR replication slot which is inactive
Version    Warning  There is at least 1 node that is not accessible
```

#### Checking health with clock skew

In this example there is a 3 node cluster with all nodes up but the system clocks are not in sync.

```bash
$ pgd check-health
__OUTPUT__
Check      Status  Message
-----      ------  -------
ClockSkew  Warning At least 1 BDR node pair has clockskew greater than 2 seconds
Connection Ok      All BDR nodes are accessible
Raft       Ok      Raft Consensus is working correctly
Replslots  Ok      All BDR replication slots are working correctly
Version    Ok      All nodes are running same BDR versions
```

#### Checking health with all nodes working correctly

In this example, there is a 3 node cluster with all nodes are up and all checks are Ok.

```bash
$ pgd check-health
__OUTPUT__
Check      Status Message
-----      ------ -------
ClockSkew  Ok     All BDR node pairs have clockskew within permissible limit
Connection Ok     All BDR nodes are accessible
Raft       Ok     Raft Consensus is working correctly
Replslots  Ok     All BDR replication slots are working correctly
Version    Ok     All nodes are running same BDR versions
```
