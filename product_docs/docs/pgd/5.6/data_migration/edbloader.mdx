[EDB\*Loader](/epas/latest/database_administration/02_edb_loader/) is a high-speed data loading utility for EDB Postgres Advanced Server. It provides an interface compatible with Oracle databases, allowing you to load data into EDB Postgres Advanced Server. It's designed to load large volumes of data into EDB Postgres Advanced Server quickly and efficiently.

The EDB\*Loader command line utility loads data from an input source into one or more tables using a subset of the parameters offered by Oracle SQL\*Loader. The source can be a flat file, pipe, or other programs. 

## Use with PGD
 
As EDB\*Loader is a utility for EDB Postgres Advanced Server, it's available for EDB Postgres Distributed when EDB Postgres Advanced Server is the database in use for PGD data nodes. PGD deployments can use EDB\*Loader in the same way as it's used on EDB Postgres Advanced Server. See the [EDB\*Loader documentation](/epas/latest/database_administration/02_edb_loader/) for more information on how to use EDB\*Loader with EDB Postgres Advanced Server.

### Replication and EDB\*Loader

As with EDB Postgres Advanced Server, EDB\*Loader works with PGD in a replication environment. You cannot use the direct load path method because the [direct path load method](/epas/latest/database_administration/02_edb_loader/invoking_edb_loader/direct_path_load/) skips use of the WAL, upon which all replication relies. That means that only the node connected to by EDB\*Loader gets the data that EDB\*Loader is loading and no data replicates to the other nodes.

With PGD, you can make use of EDB\*loader's direct load path method by running it independently on each node. You can perform this either on one node at a time or in parallel to all nodes, depending on the use case. When using the direct path load method on multiple nodes, it's important to ensure there are no other writes happening to the table concurrently as this can result in inconsistencies.
