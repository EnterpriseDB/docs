title: Replication slots created by PGD
---

On a PGD master node, the following replication slots are
created by PGD:

-   One *group slot*, named `bdr_<database name>_<group name>`
-   N-1 *node slots*, named `bdr_<database name>_<group name>_<node
    name>`, where N is the total number of PGD nodes in the cluster,
    including direct logical standbys, if any

!!! Warning
    Don't drop those slots. PGD creates and manages them and drops them when or if necessary.

On the other hand, you can create or drop replication slots required by software like Barman
or logical replication using the appropriate commands
for the software without any effect on PGD.
Don't start slot names used by other software with the
prefix `bdr_`.

For example, in a cluster composed of the three nodes `alpha`, `beta`, and
`gamma`, where PGD is used to replicate the `mydb` database and the
PGD group is called `mygroup`:

-   Node `alpha` has three slots:
    -   One group slot named `bdr_mydb_mygroup`
    -   Two node slots named `bdr_mydb_mygroup_beta` and
          `bdr_mydb_mygroup_gamma`
-   Node `beta` has three slots:
    -   One group slot named `bdr_mydb_mygroup`
    -   Two node slots named `bdr_mydb_mygroup_alpha` and
          `bdr_mydb_mygroup_gamma`
-   Node `gamma` has three slots:
    -   One group slot named `bdr_mydb_mygroup`
    -   Two node slots named `bdr_mydb_mygroup_alpha` and
          `bdr_mydb_mygroup_beta`

## Group replication slot

The group slot is an internal slot used by PGD primarily to track the
oldest safe position that any node in the PGD group (including all logical
standbys) has caught up to, for any outbound replication from this node.

The group slot name is given by the function [`bdr.local_group_slot_name()`](/pgd/latest/reference/functions#bdrlocal_group_slot_name).

The group slot can:

-   Join new nodes to the PGD group without having all existing nodes
    up and running (although the majority of nodes should be up). This process doesn't
    incur data loss in case the node that was down during join starts
    replicating again.
-   Part nodes from the cluster consistently, even if some nodes haven't
    caught up fully with the parted node.
-   Hold back the freeze point to avoid missing some conflicts.
-   Keep the historical snapshot for timestamp-based snapshots.

The group slot is usually inactive and is fast forwarded only periodically
in response to Raft progress messages from other nodes.

!!! Warning
    Don't drop the group slot. Although usually inactive, it's
    still vital to the proper operation of the EDB Postgres Distributed cluster. If you drop it,
    then some or all of the features can stop working or have
    incorrect outcomes.

## Hashing long identifiers

The name of a replication slot, like any other PostgreSQL
identifier, can't be longer than 63 bytes. PGD handles this by
shortening the database name, the PGD group name, and the name of the
node in case the resulting slot name is too long for that limit.
Shortening an identifier is carried out by replacing the final section
of the string with a hash of the string itself.

For example, consider a cluster that replicates a database
named `db20xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` (20 bytes long) using a PGD group named
`group20xxxxxxxxxxxxx` (20 bytes long). The logical replication slot
associated to node `a30xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx` (30 bytes long)
is called since `3597186`, `be9cbd0`, and `7f304a2` are respectively the hashes
of `db20xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`, `group20xxxxxxxxxxxxx`, and
`a30xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`.
