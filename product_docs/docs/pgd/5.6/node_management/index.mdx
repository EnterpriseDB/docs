All data nodes in a PGD cluster are members of one or more groups. By default, 
all data nodes are members of the top-level group, which spans all data nodes
in the PGD cluster. Nodes can also belong to subgroups that can be configured to
reflect logical or geographical organization of the PGD cluster.

You can manage nodes and groups using the various options available
with nodes and subgroups.

* [Groups and subgroups](groups_and_subgroups) goes into more detail on how
  groups and subgroups work in PGD.

* [Creating and joining groups](creating_and_joining) looks at how new PGD
  groups can be created and how to join PGD nodes to them.

* [Viewing topology](viewing_topology) details commands and SQL queries that can
  show the structure of a PGD cluster's nodes and groups.

* [Removing nodes and groups](removing_nodes_and_groups) shows the process to
  follow to safely remove a node from a group or a group from a cluster.

* [Heterogeneous clusters](heterogeneous_clusters) looks at how your PGD cluster
  can interoperate with PGD nodes from earlier editions of PGD.

* [Connection DSNs](connections_dsns_and_ssl) introduces the DSNs or connection
  strings needed to connect directly to a node in a PGD cluster. It also covers
  how to use SSL/TLS certificates to provide authentication and encryption
  between servers and between clients. 

* [Replication slots](replication_slots) examines how the Postgres replication
  slots are consumed when PGD is operating.

* [Node recovery](node_recovery) details the steps needed to bring a node back
  into service after a failure or scheduled downtime and the impact it has on
  the cluster as it returns.

* [Maintenance commands through proxies](maintainance_with_proxies) shows how to send maintenance commands to 
  nodes that you can't directly access, such as those behind a proxy.
