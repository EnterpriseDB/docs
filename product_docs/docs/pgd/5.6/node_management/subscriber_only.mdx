title: Subscriber-only nodes and groups

## Subscriber-only nodes

As the name suggests, a subscriber-only node subscribes only to replication
changes from other nodes in the cluster. However, no other nodes receive
replication changes from subscriber-only nodes. This is somewhat similar to
logical standby nodes. But in contrast to logical standby, the subscriber-only
nodes are fully joined to the cluster. They can receive replication changes from
all other nodes in the cluster and hence aren't affected by unavailability or
parting of any one node in the cluster.

A subscriber-only node is a fully joined PGD node and hence it receives all
replicated DDLs and acts on those. It also uses Raft to consistently report its
status to all nodes in the cluster. The subscriber-only node doesn't have Raft
voting rights and hence can't become a Raft leader or participate in the leader
election. Also, while it receives replicated DDLs, it doesn't participate in DDL
or DML lock acquisition. In other words, a currently down subscriber-only node
doesn't stop a DML lock from being acquired.

The subscriber-only node forms the building block for PGD tree topology. In
this topology, a small number of fully active nodes are replicating changes in
all directions. A large number of subscriber-only nodes receive only changes
but never send any changes to any other node in the cluster. This topology
avoids connection explosion due to a large number of nodes yet provides an
extremely large number of `leaf` nodes that you can use to consume the data.
## Subscriber-only groups

To make use of subscriber-only nodes, first create a PGD group of type
`subscriber-only`. Make it a subgroup of the group from which the member nodes
receive the replication changes. Once you create the subgroup, all nodes that
intend to become subscriber-only nodes must join the subgroup. You can create
more than one subgroup of `subscriber-only` type, and they can have different
parent groups.

Once a node successfully joins the subscriber-only subgroup, it becomes a
subscriber-only node and starts receiving replication changes for the parent
group. Any changes made directly on the subscriber-only node aren't
replicated.

See
[`bdr.create_node_group`](/pgd/latest/reference/nodes-management-interfaces#bdrcreate_node_group)
to know how to create a subgroup of a specific type and belonging to a specific
parent group.

!!! Note

Since a subscriber-only node doesn't replicate changes to any node in the
cluster, it can't act as a source for syncing replication changes when a node is
parted from the cluster. But if the subscriber-only node already received and
applied replication changes from the parted node that no other node in the
cluster currently has, then that causes inconsistency between the nodes.

For now, you can solve this by setting
[`bdr.standby_slot_names`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrstandby_slot_names)
and
[`bdr.standby_slots_min_confirmed`](/pgd/latest/reference/pgd-settings#bdrstandby_slots_min_confirmed)
so that there's always a fully active PGD node that's ahead of the
subscriber-only nodes.
