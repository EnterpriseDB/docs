pglogical currently has the following restrictions or missing functionality.
These might be addressed in future releases.

## Superuser is required

Currently pglogical replication and administration requires superuser
privileges. It may be later extended to more granular privileges.

## UNLOGGED and TEMPORARY not replicated

`UNLOGGED` and `TEMPORARY` tables will not and cannot be replicated, similar to
physical streaming replication.

## One database at a time

To replicate multiple databases you must set up individual provider/subscriber
relationships for each. There is no way to configure replication for all databases
in a PostgreSQL install at once.

## PRIMARY KEY or REPLICA IDENTITY required

When replicating `UPDATE`s and `DELETE`s for tables that lack a `PRIMARY
KEY`, the `REPLICA IDENTITY` must be set to `FULL`.  However it's important
to note that without `PRIMARY KEY` every `UPDATE` or `DELETE` will produce a
sequential scan on a table which will have severe detrimental effect on
performance of replication and subsequently the replication lag.

Note: On regular PostgreSQL nodes it's only possible to set the
`REPLICA IDENTITY` to `FULL` via `ALTER TABLE`, however on pglogical nodes
tables can be created with `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` directly using the following
syntax:

```sqlpostgresql
CREATE TABLE name (column_a int) WITH (replica_identity = full);
```

See <http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-altertable.html#SQL-CREATETABLE-REPLICA-IDENTITY> for details on replica identity.

## DDL

There are several limitations of DDL replication in pglogical, for details
check the [DDL Replication](ddl) chapter.

## Sequences

The state of sequences added to replication sets is replicated periodically
and not in real-time. A dynamic buffer is used for the value being replicated so
that the subscribers actually receive the future state of the sequence. This
minimizes the chance of the subscriber's notion of the sequence's last_value
falling behind but does not completely eliminate the possibility.

It might be desirable to call `synchronize_sequence` to ensure all subscribers
have up to date information about a given sequence after "big events" in the
database such as data loading or during the online upgrade.

The types bigserial and bigint are recommended for sequences on multi-node
systems as smaller sequences might reach the end of the sequence space fast.

Users who want to have independent sequences on the provider and subscriber can
avoid adding sequences to replication sets and create sequences with a step
interval equal to or greater than the number of nodes, and then set a different
offset on each node. Use the `INCREMENT BY` option for `CREATE SEQUENCE` or
`ALTER SEQUENCE`, and use `setval(...)` to set the start point.

## PostgreSQL Version differences

PGLogical can replicate across PostgreSQL major versions. Despite that, long
term cross-version replication is not considered a design target, though it may
often work. Issues where changes are valid on the provider but not on the
subscriber are more likely to arise when replicating across versions.

It is safer to replicate from an old version to a newer version since PostgreSQL
maintains solid backward compatibility but only limited forward compatibility.
Initial schema synchronization is only supported when replicating between the
same version of PostgreSQL or from lower version to a higher version.

Replicating between different minor versions makes no difference at all.

### pglogical.pglogical_version

This function retrieves the textual representation of the PGL version that is currently in use.

```
SELECT pglogical.pglogical_version();
```

### pglogical.pglogical_version_num

This function retrieves a numerical representation of the PGL version that is currently in use.
Version numbers are monotonically increasing, allowing this value to be used for less-than and greater-than comparisons.

## Database encoding differences

PGLogical does not support replication between databases with different
encoding. We recommend using `UTF-8` encoding in all replicated databases.

## Large objects

PostgreSQL's logical decoding facility does not support decoding changes
to large objects, so pglogical cannot replicate Large Objects. This does
not restrict the use of large values in normal columns.

## Additional restrictions

Please node that additional restrictions may apply depending on which
[writers.md](writer) is being used and which version of PostgreSQL is being
used. These additional restrictions are documented in their respective
sections (ie., every writer documents it's own additional restrictions).
