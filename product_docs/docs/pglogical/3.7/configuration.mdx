Several PostgreSQL configuration options may need adjusting for pglogical
to work.

PostgreSQL must be configured for logical replication:

```
wal_level = 'logical'
```

The pglogical library need to be loaded at server start, so the parameter
`shared_preload_libraries` must contain pglogical, e.g.:

```
shared_preload_libraries = 'pglogical'
```

As pglogical uses additional worker processes to maintain state and apply
the replicated changes, enough worker process slots need to be present:

```
max_worker_processes = 10
```

The formula for computing the correct value of `max_worker_processes` is:
one for instance + one per database on the provider (upstream), one for instance + one 
per database + two per subscription on the subscriber (downstream).

The replication slots and origins are used so enough slots for those need
to exist; both replication slots and origins are controlled by same
configuration option:

```
max_replication_slots = 10
```

One per subscription on both provider and subscriber is needed.

The replication data is sent using walsender (just like physical replication):

```
max_wal_senders = 10
```

There is one walsender needed for every subscriber (on top of any standbys
or backup streaming connections).

If you are using PostgreSQL 9.5+ (this won't work on 9.4) and want to handle
conflict resolution with last/first update wins (see [pglogical writer](pglogical-writer)),
you can add this additional option to postgresql.conf:

```
track_commit_timestamp = on
```

Also `pg_hba.conf` has to allow replication connections from the subscribers.

## pglogical specific settings

There are additional pglogical specific configuration options. Some generic
options are mentioned below, but most of the configuration options depend on
which [writer](subscriptions) is used and are documented as part of the
individual [writer](subscriptions) documentation.

### `pglogical.synchronous_commit`

This controls whether pglogical apply worker should use synchronous commit. By
default this is off. Turning it on has performance implications - the maximum
replication throughput will be much lower. However in low TPS environments which
use `synchronous_commit = remote_apply` on the provider, turning this option on
can improve the transaction latency. This guidance may change in later releases.

The pglogical.synchronous_commit setting for a subscription determines what
happens to the things that the subscription's apply worker writes
locally.  The subscription's apply worker operates much like a normal
client backend, and whatever it writes and commits is subject to its
current pglogical.synchronous_commit setting.

In most cases, pglogical.synchronous_commit off is the best setting because it
avoids the flushing work at commit time, and it is safe because in case
of a crash the data can be re-obtained from the publishing server.

But if you use synchronous replication on the publishing server, then
the publishing server will wait for the subscribing server to send
feedback messages when the sent data has been flushed to disk on the
subscribing server (depending on the particular setting).  If the
subscriber has pglogical.synchronous_commit off, then the flushing happens at some
random later time, and then the upstream publisher has to wait for that
to happen.  In order to speed that up, you need to make the subscriber
flush stuff faster, and the way to do that is to set pglogical.synchronous_commit
to a value other than off on the subscriber.

Also if you have standbys connected to this subscriber server then you can set the
value of pglogical.synchronous_commit to wait for confirmation from its standbys.

**NOTE** As per design, if on, this configuration will always wait for the local
flush confirmation, even if the `synchronous_standby_names` would point to any
physical standby/s.

The default is off.

### `pglogical.track_subscription_apply`

This controls whether to track per subscription apply statistics. If this is on, the
`pglogical.stat_subscription` view will contain performance statistics for
each subscription which has received any data, otherwise the view is empty.

Collecting statistics requires additional CPU resources on the subscriber.

The default is on.

### `pglogical.track_relation_apply`

This controls whether to track per table apply statistics. If this is on, the
`pglogical.stat_relation` view will contain performance statistics for
each subscribed relation which has received any data, otherwise the view is
empty.

Collecting statistics requires additional CPU resources on the subscriber.

The default is off.

### `pglogical.temp_directory`

This defines system path for where to put temporary files needed for schema
synchronization. This path needs to exist and be writeable by users running
Postgres.

The default is empty, which tells pglogical to use the default temporary
directory based on environment and operating system settings.

### `pglogical.extra_connection_options`

This option may be set to assign connection options that apply to all
connections made by pglogical. This can be a useful
place to set up custom keepalive options, etc.

pglogical defaults to enabling TCP keepalives to ensure that it notices
when the upstream server disappears unexpectedly. To disable them, add
`keepalives = 0` to `pglogical.extra_connection_options`.

### `pglogical.synchronize_failover_slot_names`

This standby option allows setting which logical slots should be synchronized
to this physical standby. It's comma separated list of slot filters.

Slot filter is defined as `key:value` pair (separated by colon) where `key`
can be one of:

-   `name` - specifies to match exact slot name
-   `name_like` - specifies to match slot name against SQL `LIKE` expression
-   `plugin` - specifies to match slot plugin name agains the value

The `key` can be omitted and will default to `name` in that case.

For example `'my_slot_name,plugin:pglogical_output,plugin:pglogical'` will
synchronize slot named "my_slot_name" and any pglogical slots.

If this is set to empty string, no slots will be synchronized to this physical
standby.

Default value is `'plugin:pglogical,plugin:pglogical_output'` meaning pglogical
slots will be synchronized.

### `pglogical.synchronize_failover_slots_drop`

This standby option controls what happens to extra slots on standby that are
not found on primary using pglogical.synchronize_failover_slot_names filter.
If it's set to true, they will be dropped, otherwise they will be kept.

The default value is `true`.

### `pglogical.synchronize_failover_slots_dsn`

A standby option for specifying which connection string to use to connect to
primary when fetching slot information.

If empty (and default) is to use same connection string as `primary_conninfo`.

Note that `primary_conninfo` cannot be used if there is a `password` field in
the connection string because it gets obfuscated by PostgreSQL and pglogical
can't actually see the password. In this case the
`pglogical.synchronize_failover_slots_dsn` must be used.

### `pglogical.standby_slot_names`

This option is typically used in failover configurations to ensure that the
failover-candidate streaming physical replica(s) for this pglogical provider
have received and flushed all changes before they ever become visible to any
subscribers. That guarantees that a commit cannot vanish on failover to a
standby for the provider.

Replication slots whose names are listed in the comma-separated
`pglogical.standby_slot_names` list are treated specially by the walsender
on a pglogical provider.

pglogical's logical replication walsenders will ensure that all local changes
are sent and flushed to the replication slots in `pglogical.standby_slot_names`
before the provider sends those changes to any other pglogical replication
clients. Effectively it provides a synchronous replication barrier between the
named list of slots and all pglogical replication clients.

Any replication slot may be listed in `pglogical.standby_slot_names`; both
logical and physical slots work, but it's generally used for physical slots.

Without this safeguard, two anomalies are possible where a commit can be
received by a subscriber then vanish from the provider on failover because
the failover candidate hadn't received it yet:

-   For 1+ subscribers, the subscriber may have applied the change but the new
    provider may execute new transactions that conflict with the received change,
    as it never happened as far as the provider is concerned;

and/or

-   For 2+ subscribers, at the time of failover, not all subscribers have applied 
    the change.The subscribers now have inconsistent and irreconcilable states
    because the subscribers that didn't receive the commit have no way to get it
    now.

Setting `pglogical.standby_slot_names` will (by design) cause subscribers to
lag behind the provider if the provider's failover-candidate replica(s) are not
keeping up. Monitoring is thus essential.

Note that this setting is generally not required for BDR3 nodes (which are
based on pglogical). Unlike base pglogical3, BDR3 is capable of reconciling
lost changes from surviving peer nodes.

### `pglogical.standby_slots_min_confirmed`

Controls how many of the `pglogical.standby_slot_names` have to confirm before
we send data to pglogical subscribers.

### `pglogical.writer_input_queue_size`

This option is used to specify the size of the shared memory queue used
by the receiver to send data to the writer process. If the writer process is
stalled or making slow progress, then the queue might get filled up, stalling
the receiver process too. So it's important to provide enough shared memory for
this queue. The default is 1MB and the maximum allowed size is 1GB. While any
storage size specifier can be used to set the GUC, the default is kB.

### `pglogical.writer_output_queue_size`

This option is used to specify the size of the shared memory queue used
by the receiver to receive data from the writer process. Since the writer is
not expected to send a large amount of data, a relatively smaller sized queue
should be enough. The default is 32kB and the maximum allowed size is 1MB.
While any storage size specifier can be used to set the GUC, the default is
kB.

### `pglogical.min_worker_backoff_delay`

Rate limit pglogical background worker launches by preventing a given worker
from being relaunched more often than every
`pglogical.min_worker_backoff_delay` milliseconds. Time-unit suffixes are
supported.

The default is 0, meaning no rate limit. The delay is a time limit applied from
launch-to-launch, so a value of `'500ms'` would limit all types of workers to
at most 2 (re)launches per second.

If the backoff delay setting is changed and the PostgreSQL configuration is
reloaded then all current backoff waits will be reset. Additionally, the
`pglogical.worker_task_reset_backoff_all()` function is provided to allow the
administrator to force all backoff intervals to immediately expire.

A tracking table in shared memory is maintained to remember the last launch
time of each type of worker. This tracking table is not persistent; it is
cleared by PostgreSQL restarts, including soft-restarts during crash recovery
after an unclean backend exit.

The view [`pglogical.worker_tasks`](troubleshooting#pglogical.worker_tasks)
may be used to inspect this state so the administrator can see any backoff
rate-limiting currently in effect.

For rate limiting purposes, workers are classified by "task". This key consists
of the worker role, database oid, subscription id, subscription writer id,
extension library name and function name, extension-supplied worker name, and
the remote relation id for sync writers. `NULL` is used where a given
classifier does not apply, e.g. manager workers don't have a subscription ID
and receivers don't have a writer id.

### `pglogical.max_writers_per_subscription`

Specifies the maximum number of parallel writers that a subscription may use.
Values between 1 and 64 are allowed, with the default being 8. When set to 1,
parallel apply is effectively disabled.

### `pglogical.writers_per_subscription`

Sets the default number of parallel writers for subscriptions without an
explicitly set value. Values between 1 and 64 are allowed, with the default
being 4.
