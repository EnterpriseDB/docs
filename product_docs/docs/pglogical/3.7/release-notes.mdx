## pglogical 3.7.15

This is a maintenance release for pglogical 3.7 which includes minor
improvements as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Add `bdr.max_worker_backoff_delay` (BDR-1767)  
    This changes the handling of the backoff delay to exponentially
    increase from `bdr.min_worker_backoff_delay` to
    `bdr.max_worker_backoff_delay` in presence of repeated errors.  This
    reduces log spam and in some cases also prevents unnecessary
    connection attempts.

### Resolved Issues

-   For the view `pglogical.subscriptions`, ensure the correct value is displayed
    in the `provider_dsn` column (BDR-1859)  
    Previously the subscriber node's DSN was being displayed.

-   Fix handling of `wal_receiver_timeout` (BDR-1848)  
    The `wal_receiver_timeout` has not been triggered correctly due to a regression
    in BDR 3.7 and 4.0.

-   Limit the `bdr.standby_slot_names` check when reporting flush position only to
    physical slots (RT77985, RT78290)  
    Otherwise flush progress is not reported in presence of disconnected nodes when
    using `bdr.standby_slot_names`.

-   Confirm LSN of LCR slot progress records when recovering LCR segments (BDR-1264)

-   Fix replication of data types created during bootstrap (BDR-1784)

### Upgrades

This release supports upgrading from following versions of pglogical:

-   3.7.9 and higher
-   3.6.29 and higher
-   2.4.0 and 2.4.1

## pglogical 3.7.14

This is a maintenance release for pglogical 3.7 which includes minor
improvements as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Implement buffered read for LCR segment file (BDR-1422)  
    This should reduce both I/O operations done by decoding worker as well as the
    amount of signalling between the decoding worker and wal senders which results
    in improved performance when decoding worker is used.

### Resolved Issues

-   Invalidate output plugin's replication set cache when published replication sets
    change (BDR-1715)  
    This ensures that published replicated sets are always up to date when user
    changes what should be published on node level. Before this fix, the old
    settings would have been applied until downstream has reconnected.
    This primarily affects BDR in situations where the `bdr.alter_node_replication_sets`
    was called on multiple nodes in quick succession.

-   Don't try to retry transaction replication when writer receives SIGTERM or SIGINT  
    This would unnecessarily hold back the shutdown of postgres when parallel apply
    is enabled.

-   Log correct error message during initial schema synchronization error (BDR-1598)  
    Previously we'd always log ERROR with message "Success" which is not helpful for
    troubleshooting.

### Upgrades

This release supports upgrading from following versions of pglogical:

-   3.7.9 and higher
-   3.6.29 and higher
-   2.4.0
-   2.4.1

## pglogical 3.7.13

This is a maintenance release for pglogical 3.7 which includes minor
improvements as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Allow the BDR consensus process to use a (sub) replorigin (BDR-1613)  
    For parallel apply, multiple writers could use invididual origins
    that would be merged, thus act kind of as child origins for a main
    or parent origin.
    Extend this mechanism to allow the BDR consensus process to also
    register an origin participating in the group.

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix the replication protocol handling of some strings (RT74123)  
    Certain strings like e.g. relation schema, relation name, attribute
    name, and message prefix were mistakenly changed to not include a
    terminating NULL character.  This led to a protocol incompatibility
    when interoperating with PGLogical 3.5.3 and older or when WAL
    messages are used (e.g. due to the use of BDR features CAMO or Eager
    All Node Replication).

-   Fix segfault when creating a subscription with the RabbitMQ writer plugin (BDR-1482, RT72434)  

-   Don't wait on own replication slot when waiting for `standby_slot_names` (RT74036)  
    The walsenders that use slots named in `standby_slot_names` should not
    wait for anything, otherwise it might wait forever.

-   Reduce logging when WAL decoder is not available (BDR-1041)  
    `pgl_xact_fully_decoded()` will log a message when it finds that
    the WAL decoder is not running. WAL decoder may not start for long
    duration and thus this log line will repeat and increase the log file
    size. There are other ways to know whether WAL decoder is running. So
    this line is not required.

-   Handle deprecated `update_differing` and `update_recently_deleted` (BDR-1610, RT74973)  
    While upgrading to 3.7, take care of the deprecated conflict types
    otherwise, as they would be unknown to the new version, it would
    not know how to handle them and break the upgrade process.

-   Enable async conflict resolution for explicit 2PC (BDR-1609, RT71298)  
    Continue applying the transaction using the async conflict resolution
    for explicit two phase commit.

### Upgrades

This release supports upgrading from following versions of pglogical:

-   3.7.9 and higher
-   3.6.28
-   2.4.0
-   2.4.1

## pglogical 3.7.12

This is a maintenance release for pglogical 3.7 which includes minor
improvements as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Add replication status monitoring (BDR-865)  
    Track the connection establishment and drops, the number of
    transactions committed as well as the restart LSN to detect repeated
    restarts and diagnose stalled replication.

-   Improve performance when used in combination with synchronous replication (BDR-1398)  
    Override `synchronous_commit` to `local'` for all PGLogical
    processes performing only bookkeeping transactions which do not need
    to be replicated.  Only the PGLogical writer processes applying user
    transactions need to follow the `synchronous_commit` mode configured
    for synchronous replication.

-   Internal improvements and additional hooks to better support BDR

### Resolved Issues

-   Performance improvements for Decoding Worker (BDR-1311, BDR-1357)
    Speed up lookups of the WAL decoder worker, reduce delays after
    reaching up to the LSN proviously known to be decoded by the
    Decoding Worker, and reduce number of system calls when writing one
    LCR chunk to an LCR segment file.

-   Improve compatibility with Postgres 13 (BDR-1396)  
    Adjust to an API change in ReplicationSlotAcquire that may have led
    to unintended blocking when non-blocking was requestend and vice
    versa.  This version of PGLogical eliminates this potential problem,
    which has not been observed on production systems so far.

### Upgrades

This release supports upgrading from following versions of pglogical:

-   3.7.9 and higher
-   3.6.27
-   2.4.0

## pglogical 3.7.11

This is a maintenance release for pglogical 3.7 which includes minor
improvements as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Resolved Issues

-   Add protection against malformed parameter values in pgl output plugin  
    This fixes potential crash when some parameters sent to the output plugin
    were malformed.

-   Get copy of slot tuple when logging conflict (BDR-734)  
    Otherwise we could materialize the row early causing wrong update in presence
    of additional columns on the downstream.

-   Use a separate memory context for processing LCRs (BDR-1237, RT72165)  
    This fixes memory leak when using the decoding worker feature of BDR.

-   Truncate LCR segment file after recovery (BDR-1236, BDR-1259)  
    This fixes memory errors reported by the decoding worker after crash.

-   Ensure `pg_read_and_filter_lcr` will exit when postmaster dies
    (BDR-1226, BDR-1209, RT72083)  
    Solves issues with hanging decoder worker on shutdown.

-   Fix memory leak in the pglogical COPY handler (BDR-1219, RT72091)  
    This fixes memory leak when synchronizing large tables.

-   Allow binary and internal protocol on more hardware combinations. This
    currently only affects internal testing.

### Upgrades

This release supports upgrading from following versions of pglogical:

-   3.7.9 and higher
-   3.6.27
-   2.4.0

## pglogical 3.7.10

This is a maintenance release for pglogical 3.7 which includes minor
improvements as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Windows support improvements (BDR-976, BDR-1083)

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix potential crash during cleanup of bulk copy replication (BDR-1168)

-   Fix issues in generic WAL message handling when the WAL message was produced
    by something other than pglogical (BDR-670)

-   Redefine `werr_age` of `pglogical.worker_error_summary` to report correct age

-   Only use key attributes of covering unique index when used as replica identity
    This only affects what is being sent over network, no logic change.

## pglogical 3.7.9

This is a maintenance release for pglogical 3.7 which includes minor
improvements as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Support two-phase commit transaction with Decoding Worker (BDR-811)  

    A two-phase commit transaction is completely decoded and sent downstream when
    processing its PREPARE WAL record. COMMIT/ROLLBACK PREPARED is replicated
    separately when processing the corresponding WAL record.

-   Reduce writes to `pg_replication_origin` when using parallel apply (RT71077)  
    Previously, especially on EPAS pglogical could produce thousands of dead rows
    in `pg_replication_origin` system catalog if it had connection problems to
    upstream.

## Resolved Issues

-   Fix flush queue truncation (BDR-890)  
    During queue compaction flush to correct LSN instead of always truncating
    whole flush queue.

-   Fix the pglogical.worker_error columns `werr_worker_index` and `werr_time`  
    Used to report wrong values.

-   Fix snapshot handling in internal executor usage (BDR-904)  
    Row filtering didn't correctly pushed snapshot in some situations.

    Caught thanks to upcoming change in PostgreSQL that double checks for this.

-   Fix handling of domains over arrays and composite types (BDR-29)  
    The replication protocol previously could not always handle columns using
    domains over arrays and domains over composite types.

## pglogical 3.7.8

This is a first stable release of the pglogical 3.7.

pglogical 3.7 is a major release of pglogical. This release includes
major new features as well as smaller enhancements.

Upgrades are supported from pglogical 3.6.25 and 3.7.7 in this release.

### Improvements

-   Allow parallel apply on EDB Advanced Server (EE)

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix divergence after physical failover (BDR-365, RT68894 and RM19886)  
    Make sure that we don't report back LSN on subscriber that
    hasn't been received by named standbys (pglogical.standby_slot_names).

    This will ensure provider side keeps slot position behind
    far enough so that if subscriber is replaced by one of said
    named standbys, the standby will be able to fetch any missing
    replication stream from the original provider.

-   Fix crash when ERROR happened during fast shutdown of pglogical writer

-   Don't re-enter worker error handling loop recursively (BDR-667)  
    This should help make what happens clearer in any cases where we do
    encounter errors during error processing.

-   Assign collation to the index scan key (BDR-561)  
    When doing lookups for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE, either to find conflicts
    or key for the operation to be applied, we should use correct collation.

    This fixes index lookups for index on textual fields on Postgres 12+.

-   Use `name` data type for known fixed length fields (BDR-561)  
    This solves potential index collation issues with pglogical catalogs.

-   Progress WAL sender's slot based on WAL decoder input (BDR-567)  
    Without slot progression the server will eventually stop working.

-   Fix begin of transaction write when LCR file does not have enough space (BDR-606)

-   Restart decoding a transaction that was not completed in single decoding worker (BDR-247)  
    If we crashed during a long transaction that spawns on more then one lcr file
    we start decoding again from the lsn of the beginning of the transaction and
    find the last lcr file where we can write into.

-   Generate temp slot with correct length in subscription sync  
    Otherwise the name of the slot might be shortened by Postgres leading to
    confusion on the slot cleanup.

-   Improve detection of mixing temporary and nontemporary objects in DDLs (BDR-485)  
    These can break replication so it's important to not allow them.

-   Fix pre-commit message handling in Eager replication (BDR-492)

-   Override GUCs in all pglogical workers, not just in writers.

## pglogical 3.7.7

This is a beta release of the pglogical 3.7.

pglogical 3.7 is a major release of pglogical. This release includes
major new features as well as smaller enhancements.

Upgrades are supported from pglogical 3.6.25 and 3.7.6 in this release.

### Improvements

-   Use parallel apply during initial sync during logical join

-   Add worker process index to the worker_error catalog (BDR-229)  
    The column `werr_worker_index` in worker_error table keeps track
    of the writers for the same subscription.

-   Various improvements for WAL decoder/sender coordination (BDR-232, BDR-335)

-   Name LCR segment similar to XLOG segments (BDR-236, BDR-253, BDR-321, BDR-322)  
    An LCR segment file is identified by five 8-digit hex numbers.
    Timeline first group, XLOG the next two groups and file number the last
    two groups.

### Resolved Issues

-   Restrict adding queue table to the replication set. (EDBAS, EBD-45)

-   Fix deadlock between receiver and writer during queue flush (BDR-483)

-   Force and wait for all writers to exit when one writer dies (BDR-229)

-   Name LCR directory after the replication slot (BDR-60)  
    Logical output plugin may be used by multiple replication slots. Store
    the LCRs from a given replication slot in a directory named after that
    replication slot to avoid mixing LCRs for different slots.

-   Fix EXPLAIN...INTO TABLE replication issue (EBC-46)

## pglogical 3.7.6

This is a beta release of the pglogical 3.7.

pglogical 3.7 is a major release of pglogical. This release includes
major new features as well as smaller enhancements.

Upgrades are supported from pglogical 3.6.25 in this release.

### Improvements

-   Enable parallel apply for CAMO and Eager (RM17858)

-   Improve error handling in Eager/CAMO, especially with parallel apply
    (BDR-106)  

-   Reduce severity of Eager/CAMO feedback errors

-   Add infrastructure necessary for allowing separation of WAL decoding from
    WalSender process in BDR (RM18868, BDR-51, BDR-60)

### Resolved Issues

-   Improve relcache invalidation handling in heap writer  
    This should solve missed invalidations after opening table for DML apply.

-   Wait for the writer that has XID assigned rather then one that doesn't
    (BDR-137)  
    This fixes deadlock in parallel apply when there is a mix of empty and
    non-empty transactions where the non-empty ones conflict.

-   Correct writer state tracking for Eager/CAMO (BDR-107)

-   Correct and improve CAMO misconfiguration handling (BDR-105)  
    Properly abort the transaction in case of sync CAMO, so the internal
    state of the PGL writer is cleared

-   Fix transaction state tracking for CAMO/Eager  
    Do not abort the transaction at pre-commit time for non-CAMO nodes, but
    keep it open until the final commit.  Adjust the transaction state
    tracking accordingly

-   Fix MERGE handling in 2ndQPostgres 12 and 13  
    We'd before allow the MERGE command on replicated tables without appropriate
    REPLICA IDENTITY which could result in broken replication.

-   Fix CAMO feedback sending (RM17858)  
    Fixes stalls in CAMO feedback, improving performance compared to previous
    3.7 beta releases. This is especially visible with parallel apply enabled.

## pglogical 3.7.5

This is a beta release of the pglogical 3.7.

pglogical 3.7 is a major release of pglogical. This release includes
major new features as well as smaller enhancements.

### Improvements

-   Optimize utility command processing (RT69617)
    For commands that won't affect any DB objects and don't affect
    pglogical we can skip the processing early without reading any
    pglogical or system catalogs or calling to DDL replication plugin
    interfaces. This is optimization for systems with large number of
    such utility command calls (that is primarily applications that
    do explicit transaction management).

-   Add upgrade path from pglogical 2.

### Resolved Issues

-   Ensure that `pglogical.standby_slot_names` takes effect when
    `pglogical.standby_slots_min_confirmed` is at the default value
    of -1.

    On 3.6.21 and older `pglogical.standby_slot_names` was ignored
    if `pglogical.standby_slot_names` is set to zero (RM19042).

    Clusters satisfying the following conditions may experience inter-node
    data consistency issues after a provider failover:

    -   Running pglogical 3.0.0 through to 3.6.21 inclusive;
    -   Using pglogical subscriptions/or providers directly (BDR3-managed
        subscriptions between pairs of BDR3 nodes are unaffected);
    -   Have a physical standby (streaming replica) of a pglogical provider
        intended as a failover candidate;
    -   Have `pglogical.standby_slot_names` on the provider configured to list that
        physical standby;
    -   Have left `pglogical.standby_slots_min_confirmed` unconfigured or set it
        explicitly to zero;

    This issue can cause inconsistencies between pglogical provider and subscriber
    and/or between multiple subscribers when a provider is replaced using
    physical replication based failover. It's possible for the subscriber(s) to
    receive transactions committed to the pre-promotion original provider
    that will not exist on the post-promotion replacement provider. This
    causes provider/subscriber divergence. If multiple subscribers are
    connected to the provider, each subscriber could also receive a different
    subset of transactions from the pre-promotion provider, leading to
    inter-subscriber divergence as well.

    The `pglogical.standby_slots_min_confirmed` now defaults to the newly
    permitted value `-1`, meaning "all slots listed in
    `pglogical.standby_slot_names`". The default of 0 on previous releases
    was intended to have that effect, but instead effectively disabled
    physical-before-logical replication.

    To work around the issue on older versions the operator is advised to
    set `pglogical.standby_slots_min_confirmed = 100` in `postgresql.conf`.
    This has no effect unless `pglogical.standby_slot_names` is also set.

    No action is generally required for this issue on BDR3 clusters.
    BDR3 has its own separate protections to ensure consistency during
    promotion of replicas.

-   Fix pglogical_create_subscriber when "-v" is passed.
    It will make pg_ctl emit meaningful information, making it easier to
    debug issues where pg_ctl fails

## pglogical 3.7.4

This is a beta release of the pglogical 3.7.

pglogical 3.7 is a major release of pglogical. This release includes
major new features as well as smaller enhancements.

### Improvements

-   Support PostgreSQL 13

-   Add `pglogical.replication_origin_status` view (RM17074)  
    Same as `pg_replication_origin_status` but does not require superuser
    permissions to access it.

-   Beta support of upgrades from 3.6 (currently from 3.6.22)

-   Improved SystemTAP support

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix race condition in replication table filtering which could cause
    crash (RM18839)  
    The cached info about table might get invalidated while used which would
    crash the backend during one of the following operations:

    -   reading the pglogical.tables view
    -   new subcription creation
    -   table resynchronization

-   Don't do transparent DDL replication on commands that affect temporary objects (RM19491, RT69170)  
    These are likely to not exist on the subscription.

-   Only run pgl specific code in deadlock detector when inside writer (RM18402)  
    It's not relevant in user backends and would cause ERRORs there.

## pglogical 3.7.3

This is a beta release of the pglogical 3.7.

pglogical 3.7 is a major release of pglogical. This release includes
major new features as well as smaller enhancements.

### Improvements

-   Parallel Apply (RM6503)
    Allows configuring number of writers per subscriptions. By default this is
    still 1, which mean parallel apply is off by default but can be enabled
    both globally (`pglogical.writers_per_subscription`) and per subscription
    (`num_writers` option in `pglogical.create_subscription()` and
    `pglogical.alter_subscription_num_writers()`).

-   Split "replicating" subscription status into two statuses  
    One is still "replicating" and is reported only if something was actually
    replicated by the subcription since last worker start. The other is "started"
    and just means that the worker for the subscription is running at the time
    the status query was executed.  
    This should reduce confusion where subscription would report "replicating"
    status but worker is in restart loop due to an apply error.

-   Substantial test and testing framework improvements

-   Improve 2ndQPostgres and BDR version dependency handling (RM17024)

-   Add PostgreSQL 12 support to `pglogical_create_subscriber`

-   Rework table resynchronization to use separate receiver process from the
    main one  
    This improves performance of both main apply (primarily latency) and the
    resynchronization itself.  
    It also fixes potential issue where table could be considered synchronized
    before the catchup finished completely.

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix crash on resynchronization of large partitioned tables (RM18154, RM15733,
    RT68455, RT68352)  
    The resync process would keep crashing due to cache invalidation race
    condition if the `COPY` took very long or if there was DDL activity on the
    copied table during the `COPY`.

-   Prohibit MERGE and UPSERT on a table without replica identity (RM17323, RT68146)
    These commands can end up doing `UPDATE` which will break replication if
    the table has no replica identity as the downstream has no way to find the
    matching row for updating.

-   Resolve relcache reference leak reports (RM16956)
    Close the relation correctly in `pglogical.show_repset_tables_info()`

-   Resolve rare crash in HeapWriter row cleanup code (RM16956)

-   Resolve rare crash on worker exit (RM11686)  
    If a pglogical worker exited before it finished initialization it could
    crash instead of exiting cleanly.

-   Fix apply errors parallel index rebuild afrer `TRUNCATE` (RM17602)  

## pglogical 3.7.2

This is a beta release of the pglogical 3.7.

pglogical 3.7 is a major release of pglogical. This release includes
major new features as well as smaller enhancements.

pglogical 3.7 introduces several major new features as well as
architectural changes some of which affect backward compatibility with
existing applications.

### Important Notes

-   Beta software is not supported in production - for application test only

-   Upgrade from 3.6 is not supported in this release, yet.

### Improvements

-   Add support for Postgres 12, deprecate support for older versions  
    pglogical 3.7 now requires at least Postgres 10 and supports up to
    Postgres 12.

### Resolved Issues

-   Keep open the connection until pglogical_create_subscriber finishes (RM13649)  
    Set idle_in_transaction_session_timeout to 0 so we avoid any user setting
    that could close the connection and invalidate the snapshot.

## pglogical 3.6.19

This is a security and maintenance release for pglogical 3.6 which includes
minor features as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Resolved Issues

-   SECURITY: Set search_path to empty for internal PGLogical SQL statements (RM15373)  
    Also, fully qualify all operators used internally. PGLogical is now
    protected from attack risks identified in CVE-2018-1058, when the
    user application avoids the insecure coding practices identified there.

-   Correct parsing of direct WAL messages (RT67762)  
    Custom WAL messages emitted by PGLogical (or plugins building on top
    of it) can be broadcast or direct types.  Decoding of the latter was
    incorrect and could in rare cases (depending on the node name) lead
    to "insufficient data left in message" or memory allocation errors.
    Decoding of such direct WAL messages has been corrected.

-   Add pglogical.sync_failover_slots() function (RM14318)  
    Signal the supervisor process to restart the mechanism to synchronize the
    failover slots specifyed in the "pglogical.synchronize_failover_slot_name".

-   Fix the `--extra-basebackup-args` argument passed to pg_basebackup (RM14808)  
    Corrects how the `pglogical_create_subscriber` tool passes on such
    extra arguments to pg_backbackup.

### Improvements

-   Add more diagnostic information to pglogical.queue message (RM15292)  
    A new key `info` has been added to `pglogical.queue` providing
    additional information about a queued DDL operation.

## pglogical 3.6.18

This is a maintenance release for pglogical 3.6 which includes minor features
as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Warn about failover issues if standby_slot_names is not set (RT66767, RM12973) 
    If pglogical.standby_slot_names is not set and a physical standby is
    configured; failover to this standby will have data consistency issues as
    per our documentation. However, the replica could just be a simple read
    replica. In any case, we now warn on the replica about the potential data
    corruption/divergence that could result if failover is desired to such a
    standby.

-   Check repsets in create_subscription for pgl2 upstreams also.  

-   Various improvements to systemtap integration.  

### Resolved Issues

-   Prevent a hang in case of an early error in the PGL writer (RT67433, RM14678)  

-   Allow postgres to start with pglogical library loaded but activity suspended  
    Add start_workers commandline-only GUC to facilitate this.

## pglogical 3.6.17

This is a maintenance release for pglogical 3.6 which includes minor features
as well as fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Make the slot synchronization to standby more configurable (RM13111)  
    Added several new configuration parameters which tune the behavior of the
    synchronization of logical replication slots from a primary to a standby
    PostgreSQL servers. This allows for better filtering, inclusion of
    non-pglogical replication sets and also using different connection string
    than physical replication uses (useful when different user or database
    should be used to collect information about slots).

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix issue with UPDATEs on partitions with different physical row
    representation than partition root (RM13539, RT67045)  
    The partitions must have same logical row as partition root they can have
    different physical representation (primarily due to dropped columns). UPDATEs
    on such partitions need to do special handling to remap everything correctly
    otherwise constraints and not-updated TOAST columns will refer to wrong
    incoming data.

-   Fix truncation of `\_tmp` slot names in sync slots  
    Long slot names could previously cause the temporary slot to be suffixed
    by `\_tm` rather than the expected `\_tmp` suffix.

### Support, Diagnostic and Logging Changes

These changes don't directly change existing behaviour or add new user-facing
features. They are primarily of interest to technical support operations and
for advanced diagnostic analysis.

-   Expand non-invasive tracing (SystemTap, linux-perf, DTrace, etc)
    support to cover inspection of the pglogical receiver's input protocol
    stream, walsender output plugin protocol stream, and other useful events.
    (RM13517)

-   Add a test and debug utility that decodes captured pglogical protocol streams
    into human-readable form (RM13538)

-   Improve error context logging in the pglogical writer to show more
    information about the transaction being applied and its origin.

-   Fix incorrectly reported commit lsn in errcontext messages from the pglogical
    heap writer (RM13796). This fix only affects logging output. The writer would
    report the lsn of the original forwarded transaction not the lsn of the
    immediate source transaction.

-   Add subscription, local node and peer node names to heap writer errcontext
    log output.

## pglogical 3.6.16

This is the sixteenth minor release of the Pglogical 3.6 series. This release
includes mostly just enables BDR 3.6.16 without any significant changes to
pglogical.

## pglogical 3.6.15

This is the fifteenth minor release of the Pglogical 3.6 series. This release
includes fixes for issues identified previously.

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix backwards-compatibility to PGLogical 2 (RM13333, RT66919)  
    Recent releases performed additional checks during
    `create_subscription`, which are fine against other PGLogical 3
    installations, but not backwards-compatible.  This release corrects
    the check to account for backwards-compatibility.

-   Correct a warning about GUC nest level not being reset (EE) (RM13375)  
    The addition of the `lock_timeout` in 3.6.14 led to a warning being
    issued for CAMO and Eager All Node transaction ("GUC nest level = 1
    at transaction start").  With this release, GUC nest levels are
    properly managed and the warning no longer occurs.

### Improvements

-   Add a new `pglogical.worker_tasks` view that tracks and records pglogical's
    background worker use. The view exposes information about the number of times
    a given type of worker has been restarted, how long it has been running,
    whether it accomplished any useful work, and more. This offers administrators
    more insight into pglogical's internal activity when diagnosing problems,
    especially when joined against the `pglogical.worker_error` table.

-   Add support for rate-limiting pglogical background worker (re)launches. The
    new `pglogical.min_worker_backoff_delay` configuration option sets a minimum
    delay between launches of all types of pglogical background workers so that
    rapid respawning of workers cannot fill the log files and or excessive load
    on the system that affects other operations.

    For example, if configured with `pglogical.min_worker_backoff_delay =
    '500ms'`, pglogical will not retry any given background worker startup more
    often than twice per second (`1000/500 = 2`).

    A simple fixed-rate factor was deemed to be the most predictable and
    production-safe initial approach. Future enhancements may add a heuristic
    delay factor based on worker type, time from start to exit, number of recent
    launches, etc.

    The launch backoff delay defaults to 0 (off) to prevent surprises for
    upgrading users.

    A setting of `pglogical.min_worker_backoff_delay = '5s'` or similar is a
    reasonable starting point, and may become the default in a future release.

### Upgrades

The PostgreSQL Global Development Group has phased out support for
PostgreSQL 9.4 on all Debian based distributions.  Following that,
this release covers only PostgreSQL 9.5 and newer.  We advise to
upgrade to a newer version.

For RedHat based distributions, this release is still available for
PostgreSQL 9.4.

## pglogical 3.6.14

This is the fourteenth minor release of the Pglogical 3.6 series. This release
includes fixes for issues identified previously.

### Resolved Issues

-   Resolve deadlocked CAMO or Eager transactions (RM12903, RM12910)  
    Add a `lock_timeout` as well as an abort feedback to the origin node
    to resolve distributed deadlocking due to conflicting primary key
    updates.  This also prevents frequent restarts and retries of the
    PGL writer process for Eager All Node and sync CAMO transactions.

## pglogical 3.6.12

This is the twelveth minor release of the Pglogical 3.6 series. This release
includes fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Add infrastructure for `check_full_row` in DELETE operations used by
    BDR 3.6.12 (RT66493)  

-   Validate requested replication sets at subscribe time (RM12020, RT66310)  
    `pglogical.create_subscription()` now checks that all requested replication
    sets actually exist on the provider node before returning. If any are
    missing it will raise an ERROR like:
      `ERROR:  replication set(s) "nonexistent_repset" requested by subscription are missing on provider`
    with a DETAIL message listing the full sets requested, etc.
    On prior releases subscriptions with missing repsets would fail after
    `pglogical.create_subscription(...)` returned, during initial sync. The
    failure would only be visible in the logs where it is much less obvious to
    the user. Or if schema sync was not enable they could appear to succeed but
    not populate the initial table contents.
      

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix a potential deadlock at CAMO partner startup. (RM12187)  
    After a restart, the CAMO partner resends all confirmations for
    recent CAMO protected transactions.  In case these fill the internal
    queue between the receiver and writer processes, a deadlock was
    possible.  This release ensures the receiver consumes pending
    feedback messages allowing the writer to make progress.

## pglogical 3.6.11

This is the eleventh minor release of the Pglogical 3.6 series. This release
includes fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Implement remote_commit_flush for CAMO. (RM11564)  
    Additional level of robustness for CAMO, only replying when xact
    is known committed and flushed on partner node.

-   Make receiver-writer shared queues of configurable size. (RM11779)  
    Two new GUCs are introduced:
      pglogical.writer_input_queue_size (default 1MB)
      pglogical.writer_output_queue_size (default 1MB)

-   Add a warning when user tries to set update_origin_change to skip  

-   Add callback to request replay progress update. (RM6747)  

### Resolved Issues

-   Send TimeZone GUC when replicating DDL (RT66019)  
    To ensure that timezone dependent expressions in DDL get evaluated to
    same value on all nodes.

-   Only use isvalid indexes when searching for conflicts (RT66036)  
    Indexes currently being created or failed index creations
    will be ignored, to prevent concurrency issues with change apply
    and `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`.

-   Fix crash when replication invalidations arrive outside a transaction (RM11159)  

-   Make the receiver apply the queue before shutting down (RM11778)  
    Upon smart shutdown, the PGL writer no longer terminates
    immediately, requiring queued transactions to be resent, but applies
    already received transactions prior to shutting down.

## pglogical 3.6.10

This is the tenth minor release of the Pglogical 3.6 series. This release
includes fixes for issues identified previously.

### Improvements

-   Add support for a CAMO remote_write mode (RM6749)

### Resolved Issues

-   COMMIT after initial sync of a table. This avoids treating the first
    catchup xact as if it was part of the initial COPY, which could lead to
    strange errors or false conflicts. (RM11284).

-   Remove the 4 billion row limit during the initial subscription
    synchronization (RT66050).

-   Cleanup table replication cache when replication set configuration changes.  
    Previously we could use stale cache on multiple calls for table replication
    info on same connection if user changed the configuration in meantime.
    This could result in initial sync missing replicated table if the
    configuration was changed while the subscription was being created.

-   Remember repsets when caching table replication info.  
    If the client calls the table replication info with different parameters,
    we need to remember them otherwise we might return cached value for wrong
    replication sets.
    This could result in initial sync copying data from table which were
    not supposed to be replicated.

## pglogical 3.6.9

This is the ninth minor release of the Pglogical 3.6 series. This release
includes minor improvements.

### Improvements

-   Add support for local, remote_apply and remote_write. (RM11069, RT65801)  
    We now accept the use of all the values that PostgreSQL accepts when configuring
    the "pglogical.synchronous_commit".

-   Immediately forward all messages from the PGL receiver back to origin (BDR CAMO)  
    Confirmations for CAMO protected transactions flow
    from the PGL writer applying the transaction back to origin node via
    the PGL receiver.  This process used to consume only one
    confirmation message per iteration.  It now consumes all pending
    confirmations from the PGL writer and immediately sends them back to
    the origin. It also decreases latency for BDR CAMO transactions in case
    confirmations queue up.

## pglogical 3.6.8

This is the eigth minor release of the Pglogical 3.6 series. This release
includes fixes for issues identified previously.

### Resolved Issues

-   Use RelationGetIndexAttrBitmap to get pkey columns. (RT65676, RT65797)  
    No need to try to fetch pkey columns from index itself, we have
    relcache interface that does exactly what we need and does so
    in more performant way.

## pglogical 3.6.7.1

This is a hot-fix release on top of 3.6.7.

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix a protocol violation after removal of an origin. (RT65671, RM10605)  
    Removal of a replication subscription may lead to a walsender trying
    to forward data for unknown origins.  Prevent emission of an invalid
    message in that case.

## pglogical 3.6.7

pglogical 3.6.7 is the seventh minor release of the pglogical 3.6 series. This release includes minor new features as well as fixes for issues identified earlier.

### Improvements

-   Replicate TRUNCATE on a partition if only parent table is published in
    replication set (RT65335)  
    Previously, we'd skip such TRUNCATE unless the partition was also published.
-   Generate `target_table_missing` for TRUNCATE which is executed against
    non-existing table (RT10291)  
    Allows for user-configured decision if it should be a replication-stopping
    issue or not.
-   Improve performance of repeated UPDATEs and DELETEs executed on origin node
    by caching the replication configuration of tables in a user session.
-   Reduce CPU usage of receiver worker when writer queue is full (RM10370).

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix partition replication set membership detection for multi-level
    partitioned tables  
    Replicate changes correctly for multi-level partitioned tables, where only
    the intermediate partition is part of replication set (not root or leaf
    partitions).
-   Support replication `TRUNCATE CASCADE` on tables referenced by
    `FOREIGN KEY` (RT65518)  
    Previously this would throw error on the subscriber. This will only work if
    all tables on subscriber which have `FOREIGN KEY` on the table being
    `TRUNCATEd` are replicated tables. Also it's only supported on
    PostgreSQL 11 and higher.
-   Flush writer between data copy and constraint restore  
    Otherwise there could in some rare cases still be unapplied changes when
    creating constraints during initial synchronization of a subscription,
    potentially causing deadlocks.
-   Fix potential writer queue corruption on very wide (1000+ columns) tables

### Upgrades

This release supports upgrading from following versions of pglogical:

-   2.2.0
-   2.2.1
-   2.2.2
-   3.2.0 and higher

## pglogical 3.6.6

pglogical 3.6.6 is the sixth minor release of the pglogical 3.6 series. This release includes minor new features as well as fixes for issues identified earlier.

### Improvements

-   New conflict type `update_pkey_exists` (RM9976)  
    Allows resolving conflicts when a `PRIMARY KEY` was updated to one which
    already exists on the node which is applying the change.

-   Add `pglogical.apply_log_summary` (RM6596)  
    View over `pglogical.apply_log` which shows the human-readable conflict
    type and resolver string instead of internal id.

-   Improve logging during both the initial data synchronization of a
    subscription and the individual table resynchronization.

### Resolved Issues

-   Make sure writer flushes changes after initial data copy (RT65185)  
    Otherwise depending on timing and I/O load the subscription might not
    update positioning info and get data both via initial copy and replication
    stream catchup that follows.

### Upgrades

This release supports upgrading from following versions of pglogical:

-   2.2.0
-   2.2.1
-   2.2.2
-   3.2.0 and higher

## pglogical 3.6.5

pglogical 3.6.5 is the fifth minor release of the pglogical 3.6 series. This release includes minor new features as well as fixes for issues identified in 3.6.4.

### Improvements

-   Improve tuple lock waits during apply for deletes (RM9569)  
    This should improve performance of replication of deletes and updates in
    contentious situation.

### Resolved Issues

-   Use consistent table list in initial data copy (RM9651/RT64809) 
    To prevent issues during initial data copy and concurrent table drop.
-   Cleanup worker_dsm_handle on worker detach (internal)  
    Otherwise we could leave dangling DSM segment handle for a worker after a
    crash, which could confuse plugins using this API.
-   Fix handling of empty eager transactions (RM9550)  
    In case no relevant change remains to be applied on a replica node,
    the prepare of such an empty transaction now works just fine.
-   Fix the replication sets output in `pglogical.pglogical_node_info()`  
    Previously it could be garbled.
-   Reduce log level for messages when resolving 
    ERRCODE_T_R_SERIALIZATION_FAILUREs (RM9439) 

### Upgrades

This release supports upgrading from following versions of pglogical:

-   2.2.0
-   2.2.1
-   2.2.2
-   3.2.0 and higher

Note that upgrades from 2.2.x are only supported on systems with
`pglogical.conflict_resolution` set to `last_update_wins`.

## pglogical 3.6.4

pglogical 3.6.4 is the fourth minor release of the pglogical 3.6 series. This release includes minor new features as well as fixes for issues identified in 3.6.3.

### New Features

-   Apply statistics tracking (RM9063)  
    We now track statistics about replication and resource use for individual
    subscriptions and relations and make them available in
    `pglogical.stat_subscription` and `pglogical.stat_relation` views.
    The tracking can be configured via `pglogical.stat_track_subscription` and
    `pglogical.stat_track_relation` configuration parameters.
-   The `replicate_inserts` option now affects initial COPY  
    We now do initial copy of data only if the table replicates inserts.

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix initial data copy of multi-level partitioned tables (RT64809)  
    The initial data copy used to support only single level partitioning,
    multiple levels of partitioning are now supported.
-   Don't try to copy initial data twice for partitions in some situations (RT64809)  
    The initial data copy used to try to copy data from all tables that are in
    replication sets without proper regard to partitioning. This could result in
    partition data to be copied twice if both root partition and individual
    partitions were published via replication set. This is now solved, we only
    do the initial copy on the root partition if it's published.
-   Fix handling of indexes when replicating INSERT to a partition (RT64809)  
    Close the indexes correctly in all situations.
-   Improve partitioning test coverage (RM9311)  
    In light of the partitioning related issues, increase the amount of
    automated testing done against partitioned tables.
-   Fix a leak in usage of the relation cache (RT64935)
-   Fix a potential queue deadlock between writer and receiver (RT64935, RT64714)

## pglogical 3.6.3

pglogical 3.6.3 is the third minor release of the pglogical 3.6 series. This release includes minor new features as well as fixes for issues identified in 3.6.2.

### New Features

-   Support `DoNotReplicateId` special origin  
    This allows correct handling of "do not replicate" origin which allows skipping replication of some changes. Primarily needed internally for other features.
-   Persist the last_xact_replay_timestamp (RT63881)  
    So that it's visible even if the subscription connection is down.
-   Rework documentation build procedure for better consistency between HTML and PDF documentation  
    This mainly changes the way docs are structured into chapters so that there is single source of chapter list and ordering for both PDF and HTML docs.

### Resolved Issues

-   Invalidate local cache when adding new invalidation  
    Fixes visibility of changes in the catalog cache view of the transaction which did those changes. Not triggered yet by any code but will be in the future releases.
-   Open indexes after partition routing  
    Otherwise we might be opening indexes of the root table rather than the partition, causing issues with handling conflicts for `INSERT` operation replication.

## pglogical 3.6.2

pglogical 3.6.2 is the second minor release of the pglogical 3.6 series. This release includes minor new features as well as fixes for issues identified in 3.6.1.

### New Features

-   Support DEFERRED UNIQUE indexes  
    They used to work only in limited cases before this release.
-   Support covering UNIQUE indexes (RT64650)  
    The use of covering UNIQUE indexes could result in ambiguous error messages in some cases before.
-   Add `--log-file` option to `pglogical_create_subscriber` (RT64129)
    So that log can be saved somewhere other than the current working directory

### Resolved Issues

-   Fix error message when the database name in the connection string in `pglogical_create_subscriber` is missing (RT64129)
    The previous message was ambiguous.
-   Raise error when unknown parameter was specified for `pglogical_create_subscriber` (RT64129)  
    Otherwise mistakes in command line arguments could be silently ignored.
-   Solve timing issue with workers exiting while another one tries to start using same worker slot  
    Before, we could corrupt the worker information causing the newly starting worker to crash (and having to start again later), this will no longer happen.
-   Set statement time on start of every transaction in pglogical workers (RT64572)  
    Fixes reporting of `xact_start` in `pg_stat_activity`

## pglogical 3.6.1

pglogical 3.6.1 is the first minor release of the pglogical 3.6 series. This release includes minor new features and fixes including all the fixes from 3.6.0.1.

### New Features

-   Add slot failover documentation
-   Add `pglogical.get_sub_progress_timestamp` for retrieving origin timestamp of the last committed change by the subscription

### Resolved Issues

-   Stop retrying subscription synchronization after unrecoverable error (RT64463)  
    If the schema synchronization failed (which is an unrecoverable error) don't keep retrying forever. Instead mark the subscription synchronization as failed and disable the subscription.
-   Improve handling and messaging with missing replication sets in output plugin (RT64451)  
    Report all missing and found sets and make sure the sets are looked up using current snapshot.

## pglogical 3.6.0.1

The pglogical 3.6.0.1 is the first bug-fix release in the pglogical 3.6 series.

### Resolved Issues

-   Improve synchronous `remote_write` replication performance (RT64397)
-   Re-add support for binary protocol

## pglogical 3.6.0

The version 3.6 of pglogical is a major update which brings performance improvements, better conflict handling, bug fixes and infrastructure necessary for BDR 3.6.

### New Features

-   Significant replication performance improvement
    -   Cache table synchronization state
    -   Only send keepalives when necessary
    -   Only do flush when necessary
    -   Serialize transactions in fewer cases in walsender (2ndQPostgres)
-   Improved replication position reporting which is more in line with how physical streaming replication reports it
-   Conflict detection and resolution improvements
    -   Add new types of conflicts (like `target_table_missing`)
    -   Add new types of conflict resolvers
    -   Make conflict resolution configurable by subscription and conflict type
    -   Improve conflict detection for updates

### Resolved Issues

-   Don't try to replicate REINDEX on temporary indexes

### Other Improvements

-   Fix potential message parsing error for two-phase commits
-   Make initial COPY of data interruptible
