Each database that participates in pglogical replication must be represented
by its own node. Each node must have a name that is unique amongst all nodes
that will interact with and communicate with each other.

A pglogical node associates an operator-supplied node name with a connection
string that pglogical subscriber nodes may use to communicate with the node.
It also serves to mark a database as pglogical-enabled and as something with
which to associate other pglogical state like replication sets or
subscriptions.

Creating a pglogical node in an existing PostgreSQL databse using the
[`pglogical.create_node`](#pglogical_create_node) function causes pglogical to
launch a manager process for the node but doesn't cause any sort of replication
to begin.

A node can be set up as a pglogical provider by having replication sets created
and/or tables and DDL filters added to the default replication set. A node can
be set up as a pglogical subscriber by having a subscription created on it
after the node is created. Any given node can be a provider, a subscriber, or
both; nothing in node creation marks the node as one or the other.

## Setting up a node as a provider

Newly created pglogical nodes have empty replication sets and do not have any
DDL replication filters enabled.

[Replication sets](replication-sets) specify what data from which tables and
sequences should be sent to any subscriptions that use this node as a provider.

[DDL replication filters](ddl) capture and replicate schema changes to
subscribers so that subscribers' definitions of tables, types, etc remain in
sync with the provider.

The simplest way to set up a new node as a provider is to re-create the
'default' replication set with all existing and future tables and sequences
auto-added to it. Then add a DDL replication filter to it to enable automatic
schema replication. For example:

```postgresql
SELECT pglogical.create_node('mynode');
SELECT pglogical.drop_replication_set('default');
SELECT pglogical.create_replication_set('default', autoadd_tables := true, autoadd_sequences := true, autoadd_existing := true);
SELECT pglogical.replication_set_add_ddl('default', 'all_ddl', '.*', NULL);
```

A replication set drop and create is used here because
`pglogical.alter_replication_set` cannot autoadd existing tables.

## Setting up a node as a subscriber

Newly created nodes do not have any subscriptions so they won't receive
changes from anywhere. Use
[`pglogical.create_subscription(...)`](subscriptions#pglogical_create_subscription)
to populate a node with initial data and start receiving streams of changes. Or use
the separate [`pglogical_create_subscriber`](subscriptions#pglogical_create_subscriber)
to create a node and subscription from a basebackup or physical streaming replica.

Creating subscriber nodes is discussed in detail in ["Subscriptions"](subscriptions).

## Node information

### pglogical.local_node

A view containing node information but only for the
local node.

## `pglogical.node`

This table lists all PGL nodes.

### `pglogical.node` Columns

| Name      | Type | Description      |
| --------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| node_id   | oid  | Id of the node   |
| node_name | name | Name of the node |

### `pglogical.node_interface`

This is a view that elaborates the information in `pglogical.node`,
showing the DSN and node interface information.

### `pglogical.node_interface` Columns

| Name      | Type | Description                           |
| --------- | ---- | ------------------------------------- |
| if_id     | oid  | Node Interface ID                     |
| if_name   | name | Name of the node the interface is for |
| if_nodeid | oid  | ID of the node                        |
| if_dsn    | text | DSN of the node                       |

## Node management

Nodes can be added and removed dynamically using SQL calls to functions
provided by pglogical.

### pglogical.create_node

Creates a pglogical node. Only one pglogical node may exist on a given
PostgreSQL database. There's nothing special to mark a node as a provider
or subscriber - one node may be either, or both.

#### Synopsis

```postgresql
pglogical.create_node(node_name name, dsn text)
```

#### Parameters

-   `node_name` - name of the new node; only one node is allowed per database
-   `dsn` - connection string to the node. For nodes that are supposed to be
    providers; this should be reachable from outside

### pglogical.drop_node

Removes the node.

#### Synopsis

```postgresql
pglogical.drop_node(node_name name, ifexists bool)
```

#### Parameters

-   `node_name` - name of an existing node
-   `ifexists` - if true, error is not thrown when subscription does not exist;
    default is false

### pglogical.alter_node_add_interface

Adds an interface to a node.

When a node is created, the interface for it is also created with the `dsn`
specified in the `create_node` and with the same name as the node.

If the address or connection options required for a subscriber to connect to a
provider change, create a new interface *for* the provider *on* the subscriber,
then associate it with the subscription so that the subscriber switches to the
new connection string. For example:

```postgresql
SELECT pglogical.alter_node_add_interface('providername', 'providername_newconnname', 'connstr');
SELECT pglogical.alter_subscription_interface('subscription_name', 'providername_newconnname');
```

At this time creating a new interface on the provider side has no effect on any
subscribers. Subscribers use the connection string specified at subscription
creation time, not the connection string declared for a node.

#### Synopsis

```postgresql
pglogical.alter_node_add_interface (
    node_name name,
    interface_name name,
    dsn text
)
```

When a node is created, the interface for it is also created with the `dsn`
specified in the `create_node` and with the same name as the node. This
interface allows adding alternative interfaces with different connection
strings to an existing node.

#### Parameters

-   `node_name` - name of an existing node
-   `interface_name` - name of a new interface to be added
-   `dsn` - connection string to the node used for the new interface

### pglogical.alter_node_drop_interface

Remove an existing named  interface from a node.

#### Synopsis

```postgresql
pglogical.alter_node_drop_interface(node_name name, interface_name name)
```

#### Parameters

-   `node_name` - name of an existing node
-   `interface_name` - name of an existing interface
