Replication sets provide a mechanism to control which tables in the database
will be replicated and which actions on those tables will be replicated.

Each replicated set can specify individually if `INSERTs`, `UPDATEs`,
`DELETEs` and `TRUNCATEs` on the set are replicated. Every table can be in
multiple replication sets and every subscriber can subscribe to multiple
replication sets as well. The resulting set of tables and actions replicated
is the union of the sets the table is in. The tables are not replicated until
they are added into a replication set.

There are three preexisting replication sets, named "default",
"default_insert_only" and "ddl_sql". The "default" replication set is defined
to replicate all changes to tables in it. The "default_insert_only" replication
set only replicates INSERTs and is meant for tables that don't have primary key
(see [Restrictions](restrictions) section for details). The "ddl_sql" replication
set is defined to replicate schema changes specified by the
`pglogical.replicate_ddl_command`.

*Note: Table are **not** added automatically to the "default" replication set,
the name "default" just means it exists by default. This behavior can be
changed using `pglogical.alter_replication_set`.*

## Behavior of partitioned tables

From PostgreSQL 11 onwards, pglogical supports partitioned tables
transparently. This means that a partitioned table can be added to a replication
set and changes to any of the partitions will be replicated downstream.

The partitioning definition on the subscription side can be set up differently to the
one on the provider. This means that one can also replicate a partitioned table to a
single table, or a single table to a partitioned table, or a partitioned tabled to a
differently'partitioned table (repartitioning).

It's also possible to add individual partitions to the replication set, in
which case they will be replicated like regular tables (to the table of the
same name as the partition on the downstream). This has some performance
advantages in case the partitioning definition is same on both provider and
subscriber, as the partitioning logic does not have to be executed.

**Note: If the root-partitioned table is part of any replication set, memberships
of individual partitions are ignored and only the membership of said root
table will be taken into account.**

### Older versions of PostgreSQL

In PostgreSQL 10 and older, pglogical only allows  the replication of partitions
directly to other partitions. Which means the partitioned table itself cannot be
added to a replication set and can't be target of replication on the subscriber
either (one can't replicate a normal table to a partitioned table).

## Replication set manipulation interfaces

The following functions are provided for managing the replication sets:

### pglogical.create_replication_set

  This function creates a new replication set.

#### Synopsis

```postgresql
pglogical.create_replication_set (
    set_name name,
    replicate_insert boolean,
    replicate_update boolean,
    replicate_delete boolean,
    replicate_truncate boolean,
    autoadd_tables boolean,
    autoadd_sequences boolean,
    autoadd_existing boolean
)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` - name of the set, must be unique
-   `replicate_insert` - specifies if `INSERT` is replicated; default true
-   `replicate_update` - specifies if `UPDATE` is replicated; default true
-   `replicate_delete` - specifies if `DELETE` is replicated; default true
-   `replicate_truncate` - specifies if `TRUNCATE` is replicated; default true
-   `autoadd_tables` - specifies if newly created tables should be automatically
    added to the new replication set; default false
-   `autoadd_sequences` - specifies if newly created sequences should be automatically
    added to the new replication set; default false
-   `autoadd_existing` - this in combination with `autoadd_tables` or `autoadd_sequences`
    specifies if any existing tables and sequences should be added as well

The autoadd options will ignore tables that are in
`information_schema` or `pg_catalog` schemas or are part of an extension.

The autoadd options will also allow automatic removal of tables from the
replication set. So there will be no dependency check on replication membership
when the table which is part of the autoadd replication set is being dropped.

If you want to replicate tables which are part of some extension, you still
have to add them manually.

### pglogical.alter_replication_set

This function changes the parameters of the existing replication set.

#### Synopsis

```postgresql
pglogical.alter_replication_set (
    set_name name,
    replicate_insert boolean,
    replicate_update boolean,
    replicate_delete boolean,
    replicate_truncate boolean,
    autoadd_tables boolean,
    autoadd_sequences boolean
)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` - name of the existing replication set
-   `replicate_insert` - specifies if `INSERT` is replicated
-   `replicate_update` - specifies if `UPDATE` is replicated
-   `replicate_delete` - specifies if `DELETE` is replicated
-   `replicate_truncate` - specifies if `TRUNCATE` is replicated
-   `autoadd_tables` - specifies if newly created tables should be automatically
    added to the new replication set
-   `autoadd_sequences` - specifies if newly created sequences should be automatically
    added to the new replication set

If any of these replication set parameters is NULL (which is the default
value if nothing else is specified), the current setting for that parameter will
remain unchanged.

### pglogical.drop_replication_set

Removes the replication set.

#### Synopsis

```postgresql
pglogical.drop_replication_set(set_name text)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` - name of the existing replication set

### pglogical.replication_set_add_table

Adds a table to a specified existing replication set, optionally requesting 
resynchronization by subscribers.

#### Synopsis

```postgresql
pglogical.replication_set_add_table (
    set_name name,
    relation regclass,
    synchronize_data boolean,
    columns text[],
    row_filter text
)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` - name of the existing replication set
-   `relation` - name or OID of the table to be added to the set
-   `synchronize_data` - if true, the table data is synchronized on all
    subscribers which are subscribed to given replication set; default false
-   `columns` - list of columns to replicate. Normally when all columns
    should be replicated, this will be set to NULL which is the
    default.
-   `row_filter` - row filtering expression; default NULL (no filtering).
    See [Row Filtering On Provider](#row-filtering-on-provider) for more info.

**WARNING: Use caution when synchronizing data with a valid row filter.**
Using `synchronize_data=true` with a valid `row_filter` is like a one-time operation for a table.
Executing it again with a modified `row_filter` won't synchronize data to subscriber. Subscribers
may need to call `pglogical.alter_subscription_resynchronize_table()` to fix it.

Also, note that if `synchronize_data` is enabled, a synchronization request is
scheduled on each subscriber and actioned asynchronously. Adding to the
replication set *does not wait for synchronization to complete*.

To wait until the resync has completed, first, on the provider, run:

```
    SELECT pglogical.wait_slot_confirm_lsn(NULL, NULL);
```

To ensure each subscriber has received the request, then on each subscriber
run:

```
    SELECT pglogical.wait_for_subscription_sync_complete('sub_name');
```

**NOTE**: There is currently no function to alter the row filter or columns of
a table's replication set membership (RM#5960). However, you can use a *single
transaction* to remove the table from the replication set and then re-add it with
the desired row filter and column filter. Make sure to set `synchronize_data :=
false`. This provides a seamless transition from the old to the new membership
and will not skip or lose any rows from concurrent transactions.

### pglogical.replication_set_add_all_tables

Adds all tables in given schemas.

#### Synopsis

```postgresql
pglogical.replication_set_add_all_tables (
    set_name name,
    schema_names text[],
    synchronize_data boolean
)
```

Only existing tables are added; any tables created later will not
be added automatically. To see how to automatically add tables
to the correct replication set at creation time, see
[Automatic assignment of replication sets for new tables](#automatic-assignment-of-replication-sets-for-new-tables).

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` - name of the existing replication set
-   `schema_names` - array of names name of existing schemas from which tables
    should be added
-   `synchronize_data` - if true, the table data is synchronized on all
    subscribers which are subscribed to the given replication set; default false

### pglogical.replication_set_remove_table

Removes a table from a specified existing replication set.

#### Synopsis

```postgresql
pglogical.replication_set_remove_table(set_name name, relation regclass)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` - name of the existing replication set
-   `relation` - name or OID of the table to be removed from the set

### pglogical.replication_set_add_sequence

Adds a sequence to a replication set.

#### Synopsis

```postgresql
pglogical.replication_set_add_sequence (
    set_name name,
    relation regclass,
    synchronize_data boolean
)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` - name of the existing replication set
-   `relation` - name or OID of the sequence to be added to the set
-   `synchronize_data` - if true, the sequence value will be synchronized immediately; default false

### pglogical.replication_set_add_all_sequences

Adds all sequences from the given schemas.

#### Synopsis

```postgresql
pglogical.replication_set_add_all_sequences (
    set_name name,
    schema_names text[],
    synchronize_data boolean
)
```

Only existing sequences are added; any sequences created later will not
be added automatically.

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` - name of the existing replication set
-   `schema_names` - array of names of existing schemas from which tables
    should be added
-   `synchronize_data` - if true, the sequence value will be synchronized
    immediately; default false

### pglogical.replication_set_remove_sequence

Remove a sequence from a replication set.

#### Synopsis

```postgresql
pglogical.replication_set_remove_sequence(set_name name, relation regclass)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` - name of the existing replication set
-   `relation` - name or OID of the sequence to be removed from the set

You can view the information about which table is in which set by querying the
`pglogical.tables` view.

## Automatic assignment of replication sets for new tables

The event trigger facility can be used for describing rules which define
replication sets for newly created tables.

Example:

```postgresql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION pglogical_assign_repset()
RETURNS event_trigger AS $$
DECLARE obj record;
BEGIN
    FOR obj IN SELECT * FROM pg_event_trigger_ddl_commands()
    LOOP
        IF obj.object_type = 'table' THEN
            IF obj.schema_name = 'config' THEN
                PERFORM pglogical.replication_set_add_table('configuration', obj.objid);
            ELSIF NOT obj.in_extension THEN
                PERFORM pglogical.replication_set_add_table('default', obj.objid);
            END IF;
        END IF;
    END LOOP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

CREATE EVENT TRIGGER pglogical_assign_repset_trg
    ON ddl_command_end
    WHEN TAG IN ('CREATE TABLE', 'CREATE TABLE AS')
    EXECUTE PROCEDURE pglogical_assign_repset();
```

The above example will put all new tables created in schema `config` into
replication set `configuration` and all other new tables which are not created
by extensions will go to the `default` replication set.

## Additional functions

### pglogical.synchronize_sequence

Push sequence state to all subscribers.

#### Synopsis

```
pglogical.synchronize_sequence(relation regclass)
```

Unlike the subscription and table
synchronization function, this function should be run on the provider. It forces
an update of the tracked sequence state which will be consumed by all
subscribers (replication set filtering still applies) once they replicate the
transaction in which this function has been executed.

#### Parameters

-   `relation` - name of existing sequence, optionally qualified

## Row Filtering on Provider

On the provider side,  row filtering can be done by specifying the `row_filter`
parameter for the `pglogical.replication_set_add_table` function. The
`row_filter` is a normal PostgreSQL expression with the same limitations as a
[`CHECK` constraint](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-CHECK-CONSTRAINTS).

You can see which row filters are active in the `pglogical.tables` view.

The table's column(s) are exposed to the row filter as simple identifiers;
there's no qualifier or namespace.

Unlike a CHECK constraint's body, the row-filter is passed as a string which is
parsed and checked by pglogical. So to avoid quoting issues you should use
PostgreSQL's dollar-quoting, like this:

```
SELECT pglogical.replication_set_add_table(
    'setname', 'tblname'::regclass,
    synchronize_data := false,
    row_filter := $FILTER$ id > 0 $FILTER$
  );
```

A simple `row_filter` would look something like `row_filter := 'id > 0'` which
would replicate only those rows where values of column `id` are greater than zero.
This *will not affect any already-committed rows pending
replication, or any already-replicated rows*.

**Important**: Caveats apply when re-synchronizing tables with row filters
using `replication_set_add_table`. See `pglogical.replication_set_add_table`.

### Writing safer row filters

Be very cautious when writing row filter expressions, and keep them as simple
as possible. If a row-filter expression raises an error during replication, it
is generally necessary to drop and re-create the subscription, resynchronizing
*all* tables, not just the table with the problem row-filter. So row filters
should be simple and defensively written. A non-exhaustive list of rules for
writing filters is that they:

-   *Should* be simple expressions wherever possible. Try to use only
    built-in PostgreSQL operators and `IMMUTABLE` functions if you can.

-   *Must* avoid using any expression that could raise an `ERROR` at runtime,
    such as casting from `text` to a more strictly validated data type. They
    must tolerate any value that the table's constraints permit to appear in
    the table.

-   *May* use `VOLATILE` or `STABLE` functions, but any functions must obey the
    same constraints as the filter expression itself.

    E.g. you can call `random()` but not `txid_current()` or
    `my_audit_log_function()`.

-   *May* call user-defined functions written in SQL, Pl/PgSQL, or (with care) C.
    Use of other languages is untested and not recommended. PL/PgSQL functions
    *must not* use `EXCEPTION` blocks, and may have other as-yet-undiscovered
    issues so their use is not recommended. Stick to SQL where possible.

-   *Should not* attempt to access any tables. Only the column values should
     be used.

     Direct use of subqueries in the row-filter expression is blocked.

     It's possible to call a user-defined function within the filter, and that
     *can* access table contents. This is *not recommended* and may be subject to
     surprising behaviour. The function *must* only access tables in
     `pg_catalog.*` or tables marked with the `user_catalog_table=true` attribute.
     Accessing other tables will not raise an error, but may cause undefined
     behaviour, errors, or crashes.

-   *Must never* attempt any write operation or anything that assigns a
    transaction-id. Similar to queries on a read-replica. Attempting writes
    will break replication.

-   *May* safely use columns of the filtered table that are not part of the
    replication set's column list. Filtering happens on the provider side
    so non-replicated columns will have their values accessible. This lets
    you do things like pre-compute complex filter criteria in triggers.

-   *Should not* rely on session state, since the `row_filter` is running inside
    the replication session. Session specific expressions such as
    `CURRENT_USER` will have values of the replication session and not the session
    which did the writes. The same is true for GUCs etc.

### Changing row filters

To change a row-filter expression on a table, use a single transaction to remove the
table from the replication set, then add it again with the new row filter expression.
Do not specify data sync and make sure to explicitly repeat the set of replicated
columns. You can check the `pglogical.tables` view for the old column set and row filter.

See `pglogical.replication_set_add_table`.
