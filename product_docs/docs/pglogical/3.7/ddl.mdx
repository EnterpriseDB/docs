title: DDL Replication
originalFilePath: ddl.md

---

pglogical3 supports *transparent DDL replication*, where schema change commands
run on provider node(s) are automatically captured and replicated to subscriber
node(s) without the need for wrapper functions like
`pglogical.replicate_ddl_command` or external schema management tools.

The main difference from normal replication of table rows ("table replication")
is that DDL replication replicates statements themselves rather than the
effects of those statements.  Normal data replication replicates the changes
made by a statement, e.g. it sends the rows that got `UPDATE`d by an `UPDATE`
command rather than replicating and executing the `UPDATE` statement itself.
pglogical's DDL replication captures, replicates and executes *the text of the
DDL statement itself*.

## Minimal example

Enabling DDL replication on a pglogical provider can be as simple as:

```
SELECT * FROM pglogical.replication_set_add_ddl('ddl_sql', 'all', NULL, NULL);
```

to replicate any captureable DDL statements executed by any user on the
provider database to any subscriber(s) that subscribe to the enabled-by-default
`ddl_sql` replication set.

However it's generally *recommended* to enable replication of a targeted subset
of DDL instead.

There are also caveats relating to replication of changes to "global objects"
like roles, the handling of some `ALTER TABLE` modes, etc that are important to
understand. See ["Restrictions"](#Restrictions) below.

## How to use DDL replication

Transparent DDL replication in pglogical builds on the same [Replication
Sets](replication-sets) model that's used by replication of table contents.
The same replication set(s) may be used for both replicating table contents
and for DDL.

To replicate future DDL commands on a provider, a DDL replication filter must
be added to the replication set(s) used by subscribers that should receive
and apply the DDL.

The DDL filter can specify a `command_tag` and `role_name` to allow
replication of only some DDL statements. The `command_tag` is same as those
used by [EVENT TRIGGERs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/event-trigger-matrix.html).
The `role_name` is used for matching against the current role which is executing the
command. Both `command_tag` and `role_name` are evaluated as regular expressions
which are case sensitive.

## Functions for managing DDL replication filters

The following functions are provided for managing DDL replication filters using
replication sets:

### pglogical.replication_set_add_ddl

Adds a DDL replication filter to a replication set.

#### Synopsis

```postgresql
pglogical.replication_set_add_ddl (
    set_name name,
    ddl_filter_name text,
    command_tag text,
    role_name text
)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` - name of the existing replication set
-   `ddl_filter_name` - name of the new DDL replication filter
-   `command_tag` - regular expression for matching command tags
-   `role_name` - regular expression for matching role name

The `command_tag` and `role_name` parameters can be set to `NULL` in which case
they will match any command tag or role respectively. They are both regular
expressions, so you can use patterns like `'CREATE.*'` or `'(CREATE|DROP).*'`.

The target object identity (oid, name, etc) are not exposed, so you cannot
filter on them.

### pglogical.replication_set_remove_ddl

Remove a DDL replication filter from replication set.

#### Synopsis

```postgresql
pglogical.replication_set_remove_ddl(set_name name, ddl_filter_name text)
```

#### Parameters

-   `set_name` - name of the existing replication set
-   `ddl_filter_name` - name of the DDL replication filter to be removed from the set

## Additional functions and views

## `pglogical.ddl_replication`

This view lists ddl replication configuration as set up by current ddl_filters.

### `pglogical.ddl_replication` Columns

| Name         | Type | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| set_ddl_name | name | Name of DDL filter                                           |
| set_ddl_tag  | text | Which command tags it applies to (regular expression)        |
| set_ddl_role | text | Which roles it applies to (regular expression)               |
| set_name     | name | Name of the replication set for which this filter is defined |

## `pglogical.ddl_replication`

This view lists ddl replication configuration as set up by current ddl_filters.

### `pglogical.ddl_replication` Columns

| Name         | Type | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| set_ddl_name | name | Name of DDL filter                                           |
| set_ddl_tag  | text | Which command tags it applies to (regular expression)        |
| set_ddl_role | text | Which roles it applies to (regular expression)               |
| set_name     | name | Name of the replication set for which this filter is defined |

### pglogical.replicate_ddl_command

This function can be used to explicitly replicate a command as-is using the
specified set of replication sets. The command will also be executed locally.

In most cases `pglogical.replicate_ddl_command` is rendered obsolete by
pglogical's support for DDL replication filters.

#### Synopsis

```
pglogical.replicate_ddl_command(command text, replication_sets text[])`
```

#### Parameters

-   `command` - DDL query to execute
-   `replication_sets` - array of replication sets which this command should be
    associated with; default "{ddl_sql}"

## Restrictions

When the DDL replication filter matches a DDL command it will modify the
`search_path` configuration parameter used to execute the DDL on both provider
and subscriber(s) to include only `pg_catalog` i.e. the system catalogs. This
means that all the user objects referenced in the query must be fully schema
qualified. For example `CREATE TABLE foo...` will raise an error when
executed and has to be rewritten as `CREATE TABLE public.foo...`.

DDL that matches the DDL replication filter and does not comply with this
requirement will fail with an error like this:

```
ERROR:  no schema has been selected to create in
STATEMENT: CREATE TABLE foo (id integer);
```

or will raise an `ERROR` message complaining that data types, tables, etc
referenced by the DDL statement do not exist even when they can be queried
normally, are shown by `psql`, etc.

For example, attempting to drop some table `public.a` will fail:

```
ERROR: table "a" does not exist
STATEMENT: DROP TABLE a;
```

and must be reframed as:

```
DROP TABLE public.a;
```

The same restriction applies to any command executed using the
`pglogical.replicate_ddl_command` function. The function call has the
additional restriction that it cannot execute special commands which need to be
run outside of a transaction. Most notably `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` will
fail if run using `pglogical.replicate_ddl_command` but will work via DDL
replication sets.

For testing purposes it can be useful to simulate the behaviour of
DDL replication capture manually in psql. To do so, set the `search_path` to
the empty string, e.g.

```
BEGIN;
SET LOCAL search_path = '';
CREATE TABLE mytable(id integer);
COMMIT;
```

will fail with `ERROR: no schema selected to create in`.

## Considerations with global objects

Because PostgreSQL has objects that exist within one database, objects shared
by all databases, and objects that exist outside the catalogs, some care is
required when you may potentially replicate a subset of DDL or replicate DDL
from more than one database:

-   pglogical can capture and replicate DDL that affects global objects like
    roles, users, groups, etc, but only if the commands are run in a database
    with pglogical ddl replication enabled. So it's easy to get into inconsistent
    states if you do something like `CREATE ROLE` in the `postgres` db then
    `ALTER ROLE` in the `my_pglogical_enabled`. The resulting captured DDL may
    not apply on the downstream, requiring a transaction to be skipped over or
    non-replicated DDL to be run on the downstream to create the object that's
    targeted by the replicated DDL.

-   pglogical can also capture and replicate DDL that references global objects
    that may not exist on the other node(s), such as tablespaces and users/roles.
    So an `ALTER TABLE ... OWNER TO ...` can fail to apply if the role, a global
    object, does not exist on the downstream. You may have to create a dummy
    global object on the downstream or if absolutely necessary, skip some changes
    from the stream.

-   DDL that references local paths like tablespaces may fail to apply on the other
    end if paths differ.

In general you should run all your DDL via your pglogical-enabled database, and
ensure that all global objects *exist* on the provider and all subscribers. This
may require the creation of dummy roles, dummy tablespaces, etc.

## `pglogical.tables`

This view lists information about table membership in replication sets.
If a table exists in multiple replication sets it will appear multiple times
in this table.

### `pglogical.tables` Columns

| Name        | Type    | Description                                          |
| ----------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| relid       | oid     | The OID of the relation                              |
| nspname     | name    | Name of the schema relation is in                    |
| relname     | name    | Name of the relation                                 |
| set_name    | name    | Name of the replication set                          |
| set_ops     | text\[] | List of replicated operations                        |
| rel_columns | text\[] | List of replicated columns (NULL = all columns) (\*) |
| row_filter  | text    | Row filtering expression                             |

## `pglogical.queue`

DDL can also be queued up with a message to state the replication information.
This can be seen in ascending order, on this view.

## `pglogical.queue_truncate`

A function that erase's all the logging information of the view.
