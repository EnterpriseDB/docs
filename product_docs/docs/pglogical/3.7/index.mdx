The pglogical 3 extension provides logical streaming replication for PostgreSQL,
using a publish/subscribe model. It is based on technology developed as part
of the BDR3 project.

We use the following terms to describe data streams between nodes:

-   Nodes - PostgreSQL database instances
-   Providers and Subscribers - roles taken by Nodes
-   Replication Set - a collection of tables

These terms have been deliberately reused from the earlier Slony technology.

pglogical is new technology utilizing the latest in-core features, so we
require both provider and subscriber nodes to run PostgreSQL 10 or newer.

Use cases supported are:

-   Upgrades between major versions (given the above restrictions)
-   Full database replication
-   Selective replication of sets of tables using replication sets
-   Selective replication of table rows at either provider or subscriber side (row_filter)
-   Selective replication of table columns at provider side
-   Data gather/merge from multiple upstream servers

Architectural details:

-   pglogical works on a per-database level, not whole server level like
    physical streaming replication
-   One Provider may feed multiple Subscribers without incurring additional disk
    write overhead
-   One Subscriber can merge changes from several origins and detect conflict
    between changes with automatic and configurable conflict resolution (some,
    but not all aspects required for multi-master).
-   Cascading replication is implemented in the form of changeset forwarding.
