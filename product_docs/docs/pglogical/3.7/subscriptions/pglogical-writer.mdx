The pglogical writer (or HeapWriter) is the standard way of writing into a local
PostgreSQL instance when using pglogical subscription. This is the default
writer used when no writer is specified in `pglogical.create_subscription()`.

The pglogical writer is using low-level APIs to write the data into local
tables and sequences. It supports conflict detection and resolution,
has full support for `REPLICA IDENTITY`, invokes constraints with the exception
of foreign keys (see [Foreign Keys](#foreign-keys) for details) and row triggers
marked as `REPLICA` (see [Triggers](#triggers)).

Changes are applied as the table owning-user, thus security concerns are similar
to the use of triggers by table owners.

## Conflict handling

In case the node is subscribed to multiple providers, or when local writes
happen on a subscriber, conflicts can arise for the incoming changes. These
are automatically detected and can be acted on depending on the configuration.

The configuration of the conflicts resolver is done using
pglogical.alter_subscription_set_conflict_resolver().

### Row versioning

To ease reasoning about different versions of a row, it can be helpful for it
to carry a row version. PGLogical provides the helper trigger
`pglogical.inc_row_version` to simplify this task. It requires a user
provided integer column of any bitwidth (usually, `SMALLINT` is enough) and
needs to be added to a table as follows (assuming a table `my_table` with
an integer column `row_version`):

```sql
CREATE TRIGGER my_row_version_trigger
BEFORE UPDATE ON my_table
FOR EACH ROW
EXECUTE PROCEDURE pglogical.inc_row_version('row_version');
```

This approach resembles Lamport timestamps and - in combination with
`REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` and `check_full_tuple` (see below) - fully prevents
the ABA problem for conflict detection.

## Configuration options

Some aspects of pglogical can be configured using configuration options that
can be either set in `postgresql.conf` or via `ALTER SYSTEM SET`.

### pglogical.conflict_log_level

Sets the log level for reporting detected conflicts.

Main use for this setting is to suppress logging of conflicts.

Possible values are the same as for PostgreSQL `log_min_messages` parameter.

The default is `LOG`.

### pglogical.conflict_ignore_redundant_updates

In case the subscriber retrieves an INSERT or UPDATE to a locally
pre-existing and equivalent tuple, it is simply ignored without invoking any
conflict handler or logging on the subscriber side, if this option is turned
on.

To be used in combination with `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`.

The default is `false`.

### pglogical.conflict_check_full_tuple

This option controls the detection of UPDATE-UPDATE conflicts. By default,
the origin of the existing tuple is compared to the expected origin -
every mismatch is considered a conflict and initiates conflict handling.
This is a low-overhead conflict detection mechanism and is therefore the
default. However, it can lead to false positives and invoke conflict
handlers inadvertently.

With this option turned on, the expected tuple, as it was before the update on
the provider, is compared to the existing tuple on the subscriber. This
allows for a better conflict detection mechanism and (in combination with
a row version column) can mitigate all false positives.

Due to the requirement to know the full old tuple, this option only ever
affects relations that are set to `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`.

The default is `false`.

### pglogical.batch_inserts

This tells pglogical writer to use the batch insert mechanism if possible. The
Batch mechanism uses PostgreSQL internal batch insert mode which is also used
by `COPY` command.

The batch inserts will improve replication performance of transactions that
perform many inserts into one table. pglogical will switch to batch mode when
the transaction performed than 5 INSERTs, or 5 rows within a COPY.

It's only possible to switch to batch mode when there are no
`INSTEAD OF INSERT` and `BEFORE INSERT` triggers on the table and when
there are no defaults with volatile expressions for columns of the table.

The default is `true`.

### config.session_replication_role

This tells pglogical writer what `session_replication_role` to use. This can be
useful mainly in case when it's desirable to enforce `FOREIGN KEY` constraints.

The default is `replica` which ignores foreign keys when writing changes
to the database.

**WARNING: Use with caution.**
This option changes trigger execution behavior as documented in
[PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-client.html#GUC-SESSION-REPLICATION-ROLE).
If set to `origin` or `local` this will fire **normal** triggers in the
database which can leadi to the trigger being executed both on the upstream and on
the downstream!

## Restrictions

There are some additional restrictions imposed by pglogical writer over the
standard set of [restrictions](restrictions).

### Only one unique index/constraint/PK

If more than one upstream is configured, or the downstream accepts local writes,
then only one `UNIQUE` index should be present on downstream replicated tables.
Conflict resolution can only use one index at a time, so conflicting rows may
`ERROR` if a row satisfies the `PRIMARY KEY` but violates a `UNIQUE` constraint
on the downstream side. This will stop replication until the downstream table
is modified to remove the violation.

It's fine to have extra unique constraints on an upstream if the downstream only
gets writes from that upstream and nowhere else. The rule is that the downstream
constraints must *not be more restrictive* than those on the upstream(s).

### Deferrable unique indexes

Deferrable unique indexes are supported; however initially deferred unique
indexes might result in apply retries, as the conflicts might not be detected
on first try due to the deferred uniqueness check.

Note that deferred `PRIMARY KEY` cannot be used as `REPLICA IDENTITY` - PostgreSQL
will throw an error if this is attempted. As a result a table withi a deferred
`PRIMARY KEY` does not have `REPLICA IDENTITY` unless another `REPLICA IDENTITY`
is explicitly set. Replicated tables without `REPLICA IDENTITY` cannot receive
`UPDATEs` or `DELETEs`.

### Foreign Keys

By default foreign key constraints are not enforced for the replication
process - what succeeds on the provider side gets applied to the subscriber
even if the `FOREIGN KEY` would be violated.

This behavior can be changed using `config.session_replication_role` writer
option.

### TRUNCATE

Using `TRUNCATE ... CASCADE` will only apply the `CASCADE` option on the
provider side.

(Properly handling this would probably require the addition of `ON TRUNCATE CASCADE`
support for foreign keys in PostgreSQL).

`TRUNCATE ... RESTART IDENTITY` is not supported. The identity restart step is
not replicated to the replica.

### Triggers

Trigger behavior depends on the `config.session_replication_role` setting of
the writer. By default it's set to `replica`, which means that `ENABLE REPLICA`
and `ENABLE ALWAYS` triggers will be fired. When it's set to `origin` or
`local`, it will trigger normal triggers.

Only row triggers are fired. Statement triggers are ignored as there are no
statements executed by the writer. Per-column UPDATE triggers are ignored.
