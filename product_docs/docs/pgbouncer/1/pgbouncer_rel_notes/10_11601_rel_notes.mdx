| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Upstream merge | Merged with community PgBouncer 1.16.0.1. See the community [Release Notes](https://www.pgbouncer.org/changelog.html#pgbouncer-116x) for details.                                             |
| Feature        | Support hot reloading of TLS settings. When the configuration file is reloaded, updated TLS settings are automatically enforced.                                                              |
| Feature        | Add support for abstract Unix-domain sockets. Prefix a Unix-domain socket path with `@` to use a socket in the abstract namespace.                                                            |
| Feature        | The maximum length of passwords and user names have been increased to 996 and 128, respectively. Various cloud services require this.                                                          |
| Feature        | The minimum pool size can now be set per database, similar to the regular pool size and the reserve pool size.                                                                                |
| Feature        | The number of pending query cancellations is shown in SHOW POOLS.                                                                                                                             |
| Bug fix        | Configuration parsing now has tighter error handling in many places. Previously, it might have logged an error and proceeded. Those configuration errors would now result in startup failures.|
| Bug fix        | Query cancel handling has been fixed. Under some circumstances, cancel requests would seemingly get stuck for a long time.                                                                    |
| Bug fix        | Mixed use of md5 and scram via hba has been fixed.                                                                                                                                            |
| Bug fix        | The “FIXME: query end, but query_start == 0” messages have been fixed. The cause of these messages is now known.                                                                              | 
| Bug fix        | Fix reloading of default_pool_size, min_pool_size, and res_pool_size. Previously when these properties were reloaded, it didn’t work.                                                         |
