You must install Advanced Server before installing PgBouncer. For details about installing and configuring Advanced Server, see the EDB Advanced Server Installation Guide available at the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/p/edb-postgres-advanced-server). To install a package on a Debian or Ubuntu host, you must have credentials to access the EnterpriseDB repository. See the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user) to request the EnterpriseDB credentials.

The following steps will walk you through using the EnterpriseDB repository to install a DEB package. When using the commands, replace the `username` and `password` with the credentials provided by EnterpriseDB.

1.  Assume superuser privileges:

    ``` text
    sudo su â€“
    ```

2.  Configure the EnterpriseDB repository:

    On Debian 9, Ubuntu 18, and Ubuntu 20:

    ``` text
    sh -c 'echo "deb https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
    ```

    On Debian 10:

    a.  Set up the EnterpriseDB repository:

    ``` text
    sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
    ```

    b.  Substitute your EnterpriseDB credentials for the `username` and `password` placeholders in the following command:

    ``` text
    sh -c 'echo "machine apt.enterprisedb.com login <username> password <password>" > /etc/apt/auth.conf.d/edb.conf'
    ```

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

    ``` text
    apt-get install apt-transport-https
    ```

4.  Add the EDB signing key:

    ``` text
    wget -q -O - https://apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key  | sudo apt-key add -
    ```

5.  Update the repository metadata:

    ``` text
    apt-get update
    ```

6.  Install the Debian package:

    ``` text
    apt-get -y install edb-pgbouncer<xx>
    ```
    
    Where *&lt;xx&gt;* is the PgBouncer version you want to install.
    
    For example, to install the PgBouncer 1.15 package for EDB Advanced Server 13, execute the following command:
    
    ``` text
    apt-get -y install edb-pgbouncer115
    ```

PgBouncer will be installed in the `/usr/edb/pgbouncer<x.x>` directory.

Where &lt;x.x&gt; is the PgBouncer version you have installed.
