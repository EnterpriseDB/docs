You must install Advanced Server before installing PgBouncer. For details about installing and configuring Advanced Server, see [the EDB Postgres Advanced Server Installation Guide](https://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/p/edb-postgres-advanced-server). To install a package on a Debian or Ubuntu host, you must have credentials to access the EnterpriseDB repository. If you need EnterpriseDB credentials, [visit the EnterpriseDB website](https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339//images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf).

The following steps will walk you through using the EnterpriseDB repository to install a DEB package. When using the commands, replace the `username` and `password` with the credentials provided by EnterpriseDB.

Please note that if you are using the pdf version of this document, using cut/paste to copy command may result in extra spaces or carriage returns in the pasted command. If a command fails, check the command carefully for additional characters.

1.  Assume superuser privileges:

    >
    >
    > ``` text
    > sudo su â€“
    > ```

2.  Configure the EnterpriseDB repository:

    >
    >
    > ``` text
    > sh -c 'echo "deb https://<username>:<password>@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
    > ```

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

    >
    >
    > ``` text
    > apt-get install apt-transport-https
    > ```

4.  Add the EDB signing key:

    >
    >
    > ``` text
    > wget -q -O - https://<username>:<password>@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add -
    > ```

5.  Update the repository metadata:

    >
    >
    > ``` text
    > apt-get update
    > ```

6.  Install the DEB package:

    >
    >
    > ``` text
    > apt-get install edb-pgbouncer<xx>
    > ```
    >
    > Where *\<xx\>* is the pgbouncer version you want to install.
    >
    > For example, to install the pgbouncer 1.13.0.1 package for Advanced Server 12, execute the following command:
    >
    > ``` text
    > apt-get install edb-pgbouncer113
    > ```

PgBouncer will be installed in the `/usr/edb/pgbouncer<x.x>` directory, where `<x.x>` is the PgBouncer version you have installed.
