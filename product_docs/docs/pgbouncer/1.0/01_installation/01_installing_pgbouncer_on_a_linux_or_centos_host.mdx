<div id="performing_an_rpm_installation" class="registered_link"></div>


If you have previously used an RPM package to install Advanced Server, you have probably already created the repository configuration file and have EnterpriseDB credentials. If that is the case, you can install PgBouncer with the following command:

On RHEL/CentOS 6 and 7:

``` text
yum install edb-pgbouncer<xx>
```

Where `<xx>` is the PgBouncer version you want to install.

For example, to install PgBouncer 1.9.0.1 on a CentOS/RHEL 6 and 7 host, the command is:

``` text
yum install edb-pgbouncer19
```

On a RHEL/CentOS 8 host, you can use the `dnf` package manager to install PgBouncer:

``` text
dnf install edb-pgbouncer<xx>
```

Where `<xx>` is the PgBouncer version you want to install.

Similarly, to install PgBouncer 1.13.0.1 on CentOS/RHEL 8, the command is:

``` text
dnf install edb-pgbouncer113
```

To create the repository file, follow the steps given below.

## Creating a Repository Configuration File to Install PgBouncer

Before creating the repository configuration file, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, [visit the EnterpriseDB website](https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339//images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf).

1.  To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges, and invoke one of the following platform-specific commands:

On RHEL/CentOS 6 and 7:

``` text
yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
```

On CentOS/RHEL 8:

``` text
dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`, which resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

2.  After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to open this file and ensure that the value of the enabled parameter is `1`, and the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification are replaced with the name and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user.

    >
    >
    > ``` text
    > [edb]
    > name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
    > baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
    > enabled=1
    > gpgcheck=1
    > gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
    > ```

3.  Save your changes to the configuration file and exit the editor.

4.  Execute the following commands to update the metadata:

    ``` text
    yum clean all
    ```

    ``` text
    yum makecache
    ```

<!-- end list -->

5.  Before installing PgBouncer, you must install the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) release package by executing the following command:

    On RHEL/CentOS 6 and 7:

    ``` text
    yum -y install epel-release
    ```

    On RHEL/CentOS 8:

    ``` text
    dnf -y install epel-release
    ```

Note

</div>

You may need to enable the `[extras]` repository definition in the `CentOS-Base.repo` file (located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`).

</div>

6.  Then, use one of the following platform-specific command to install PgBouncer.

    On RHEL/CentOS 6 and 7:

    ``` text
    yum install edb-pgbouncer<xx>
    ```

Where `<xx>` is the PgBouncer version you want to install.

For example, the following command installs PgBouncer 1.9.0.1 on RHEL/CentOS 6 and 7:

>
>
> ``` text
> yum install edb-pgbouncer19
> ```
>
> On RHEL/CentOS 8:
>
> ``` text
> dnf install edb-pgbouncer<xx>
> ```

Where `<xx>` is the PgBouncer version you want to install.

Similarly, to install PgBouncer 1.13.0.1 on CentOS/RHEL 8, the command is:

>
>
> ``` text
> dnf install edb-pgbouncer113
> ```

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve. PgBouncer will be installed in the `/usr/edb/pgbouncer<x.x>` directory.
