This section walks you through how to configure and use PgBouncer.

## Configuring PgBouncer

When the pgbouncer service is running, any Postgres client connecting to the pgbouncer listener port specified in the configuration file will use connection pooling.

PgBouncer connection and configuration information is stored in the `.ini` file, located in the following directory:

**On Linux**:

`/etc/edb/pgbouncer1.13/edb-pgbouncer-1.13.ini`

**On Debian**:

`/etc/edb/pgbouncer1.13/pgbouncer.ini`

**On Windows**:

`C:\Program Files\edb\pgbouncer1.13\share\pgbouncer.ini`

The pgbouncer configuration file is divided into two sections: `[databases]` and `[pgbouncer]`.

The `[databases]` section of the configuration file contains a list of databases and the associated connection information. In an Advanced Server installation, the configuration file contains an entry for the installation of Advanced Server that installed pgbouncer:

> `edb = host=127.0.0.1 port=5444`

You can specify additional database connection information in the configuration file in the form of `keyword=value` pairs. You can include the following parameters:

| Parameter | Description                                                                         |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| name      | The name of the database to which the client application will connect.              |
| host      | The IP address of the host.                                                         |
| port      | The port on which the host is listening.                                            |
| dbname    | The (optional) database name.                                                       |
| user      | A username (if different than the information specified by the connecting client ). |
| password  | A password (if different than the information specified by the connecting client).  |

The following example demonstrates the syntax allowed in the `[databases]` section of the configuration file:

``` text
[databases]
edb = host=127.0.0.1 port=5444
acctg = host=192.168.10.101 port=5432 user=bob password=XXXXXX
```

Include the `dbname` parameter to map the connection name to an alternate database name. For example:

> `hr = host=127.0.0.1 port=5445 dbname=humanresources`

When the client provides authentication information, that information is used to connect to pgbouncer, which in turn uses the information specified in the pgbouncer configuration file to connect to the database server. The user information provided in the configuration file must match a role defined in the Postgres database cluster.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

If you do not specify user details in `pgbouncer.ini`, the username and password will be authenticated by the database server and pgbouncer. As such, the username and password should be included in the `userlist.txt` file and the database cluster.

</div>

The `[pgbouncer]` section of the configuration file contains configuration details specific to pgbouncer:

<div class="table-with-scroll">

Within the authentication file, the username and password must be specified within double-quotes, as shown below:</p>
<p><em>"user_name" "password"</em></p>

The following example demonstrates the syntax allowed in the `[pgbouncer]` section of the configuration file for edb-pgbouncer-1.13 version:

``` text
[pgbouncer]
logfile = /var/log/edb/pgbouncer1.13/edb-pgbouncer-1.13.log
pidfile = /var/run/edb/pgbouncer1.13/edb-pgbouncer-1.13.pid
listen_addr = *
listen_port = 6432
auth_type = md5
auth_file = /opt/edb/pgbouncer-1.13/etc/userlist.txt
admin_users = enterprisedb
stats_users = enterprisedb
pool_mode = session
server_reset_query = DISCARD ALL
ignore_startup_parameters = application_name
max_client_conn = 100
default_pool_size = 20
group_connections = 0
```

For more information about the settings used in the `pgbouncer.ini` file, see [the PgBouncer documentation](https://pgbouncer.github.io/config.html).

After editing the pgbouncer configuration file to reflect your environment, you must restart the pgbouncer service for the changes to take effect. The name of the pgbouncer service is `edb-pgbouncer-1.13`; use platform specific commands to stop, start, or restart the service as needed.

## Using the PgBouncer Admin Console

The Admin Console allows you to retrieve statistical information about pgbouncer activity, and to control the pgbouncer process. You can use the edb-psql client to access the pgbouncer Admin Console by connecting to the `pgbouncer` database. The following example connects to the `pgbouncer` database with the edb-psql client on a Linux system. pgbouncer is listening on port `6432`, with a user name of `enterprisedb`:

Enter following command after navigating to the `bin` directory under your Advanced Server installation:

> `# ./edb-psql -p 6432 -U enterprisedb pgbouncer`

Please note that the required connection information will vary according to the connecting client, platform and authentication information required by the server.

After connecting to the `pgbouncer` database, you can use the `SHOW CLIENTS` command to retrieve client-related information:

> `# SHOW CLIENTS;`

The `SHOW CLIENTS` command returns:

``` text
--[ RECORD 1]-+--------------------
   type         | C
   user         | postgres
   database     | pgbouncer
   state        | active
   addr         | unix
   port         | 6432
   local_addr   | unix
   local_port   | 6432
   connect_time | 2010-05-25 05:26:20
   request_time | 2010-05-25 05:39:46
   ptr          | 0x8655d20
   link         |
```

You can use other variations of the `SHOW` command to retrieve information about pgbouncer:

   `SHOW STATS`  
   `SHOW SERVERS`  
   `SHOW POOLS`  
   `SHOW LISTS`  
   `SHOW USERS`  
   `SHOW DATABASES`  
   `SHOW FDS`  
   `SHOW CONFIG`

You can use the following commands to control the pgbouncer process:

`PAUSE`

> Use the `PAUSE` command to disconnect all servers after waiting for current queries to complete.

`SUSPEND`

> Use the `SUSPEND` command to flush the socket buffers and suspend the pgbouncer process.

`RESUME`

> Use the `RESUME` command to resume work after a `PAUSE` or `SUSPEND` command.

`SHUTDOWN`

> Use the `SHUTDOWN` command to stop the pgbouncer process and exit.

`RELOAD`

> Use the `RELOAD` command to reload the pgbouncer configuration files.
