This section walks you through how to configure and use PgBouncer.

## Configuring PgBouncer

When the PgBouncer service is running, any Postgres client connecting to the PgBouncer listener port specified in the configuration file will use connection pooling. PgBouncer connection and configuration information is stored in the `.ini` file.

On RedHat/Centos, Debian, and SLES 12 SP4, the `.ini` file is located in the following directory:

`/etc/edb/pgbouncer<x.x>/`

Where &lt;x.x&gt; is the PgBouncer version.

On Windows, the `.ini` file is located in the following directory:

`C:\Program Files\edb\pgbouncer<x.x>\share\`

Where &lt;x.x&gt; is the PgBouncer version.

The PgBouncer configuration file is divided into two sections: `[databases]` and `[pgbouncer]`.

The `[databases]` section of the configuration file contains a list of databases and the associated connection information. For Advanced Server, the configuration file contains an entry for the installation of Advanced Server that installed PgBouncer:

`edb = host=127.0.0.1 port=5444`

For PostgreSQL Server, you need to enter PostgreSQL server details as shown in the following example.

`postgres = host=127.0.0.1 port=5432`

You can specify additional database connection information in the configuration file in the form of `keyword=value` pairs. You can include the following parameters:

| Parameter  | Description                                                                         |
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `host`     | The IP address of the host.                                                         |
| `port`     | The port on which the host is listening.                                            |
| `dbname`   | The (optional) database name.                                                       |
| `user`     | A username (if different than the information specified by the connecting client ). |
| `password` | A password (if different than the information specified by the connecting client).  |

The following example demonstrates the syntax allowed in the `[databases]` section of the configuration file:

``` text
[databases]
edb = host=127.0.0.1 port=5444
postgres = host=127.0.0.1 port=5432
acctg = host=192.168.10.101 port=5432 user=bob password=XXXXXX
```

Include the `dbname` parameter to map the connection name to an alternate database name. For example:

`hr = host=127.0.0.1 port=5445 dbname=humanresources`

When the client provides authentication information, that information is used to connect to PgBouncer, which in turn uses the information specified in the PgBouncer configuration file to connect to the database server. The user information provided in the configuration file must match a role defined in the Postgres database cluster.

!!! Note

    If you do not specify user details in `pgbouncer.ini`, the username and password will be authenticated by the database server and PgBouncer. As such, the username and password should be included in the `userlist.txt` file and the database cluster.

The `[pgbouncer]` section of the configuration file contains configuration details specific to PgBouncer:

| **Parameter**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `admin_users`               | A comma-delimited list of users that are allowed to access the Admin Console (for management and monitoring purposes). By default, PgBouncer is installed with an `admin_users = enterprisedb`. For the PostgreSQL server, set this value as `admin_users = postgres`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `auth_file`                 | The path to the authentication file that contains username and passwords of clients that may connect to PgBouncer. The authentication file (userlist.txt) is located in `/etc/edb/pgbouncer<x.x>/`, and contains *username/password* pairs that specify the identities that clients may use to access PgBouncer. Within the authentication file, the username and password must be specified within double-quotes. To make changes to the identities that can access PgBouncer, you can edit the existing authentication file, or specify an alternate authentication file with the `auth_file` parameter. |
| `auth_type`                 | The authentication method used by PgBouncer. May be: md5, crypt, plain, trust or any. The default value is md5.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `listen_addr`               | The IP address on which PgBouncer listens for client connections. If omitted, only Unix socket connections are allowed; the client must also reside on the same host as PgBouncer and may not specify a host IP address when connecting to PgBouncer.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `listen_port`               | The port that PgBouncer monitors for client connections. By default, PgBouncer listens on port 6432.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

After editing the PgBouncer configuration file to reflect your environment, you must restart the PgBouncer service for the changes to take effect. For CentOS, RHEL, SUSE, and Windows platforms, the PgBouncer service name is `edb-pgbouncer-1.15`, and for Deb packages, the PgBouncer service name is `edb-pgbouncer115`; use platform-specific commands to stop, start, or restart the service as needed.

## Using the PgBouncer Admin Console

The Admin Console allows you to retrieve statistical information about PgBouncer activity, and to control the PgBouncer process. You can use the edb-psql client to access the PgBouncer Admin Console by connecting to the `pgbouncer` database.

The following example connects to the `pgbouncer` database with the edb-psql client on a Linux system. PgBouncer is listening on port `6432`, with a user name of `enterprisedb`:

Enter following command after navigating to the `bin` directory under your Advanced Server installation. Please note that the required connection information will vary according to the connecting client, platform and authentication information required by the server.

`$ ./edb-psql -p 6432 -U enterprisedb pgbouncer`

For PostgreSQL server, the command is:

`$ ./edb-psql -p 6432 -h /tmp -U postgres  pgbouncer`

After connecting to the `pgbouncer` database, you can use the `SHOW CLIENTS` command to retrieve client-related information:

`# SHOW CLIENTS;`

The `SHOW CLIENTS` command returns:

``` text
--[ RECORD 1]-+--------------------
   type         | C

```

You can use other variations of the `SHOW` command to retrieve information about PgBouncer:

`SHOW STATS`  
   `SHOW SERVERS`  
   `SHOW POOLS`  
   `SHOW LISTS`  
   `SHOW USERS`  
   `SHOW DATABASES`  
   `SHOW FDS`  
   `SHOW CONFIG`

You can use the following commands to control the PgBouncer process. For more information about using PgBouncer, see the [PgBouncer project site](https://www.pgbouncer.org/usage.html).

`PAUSE`

Use the `PAUSE` command to disconnect all servers after waiting for current queries to complete.

`SUSPEND`

Use the `SUSPEND` command to flush the socket buffers and suspend the PgBouncer process.

`RESUME`

Use the `RESUME` command to resume work after a `PAUSE` or `SUSPEND` command.

`SHUTDOWN`

Use the `SHUTDOWN` command to stop the PgBouncer process and exit.

`RELOAD`

Use the `RELOAD` command to reload the PgBouncer configuration files.
