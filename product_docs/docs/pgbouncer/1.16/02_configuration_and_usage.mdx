Configure EDB PgBouncer before you use it.

## Configuring EDB PgBouncer

When the EDB PgBouncer service is running, any Postgres client connecting to the EDB PgBouncer listener port specified in the configuration file uses connection pooling. EDB PgBouncer connection and configuration information is stored in the `.ini` file.

On RedHat/Centos, Debian, and SLES 12 SP5, the `.ini` file is located in the following directory:

`/etc/edb/pgbouncer<x.x>/`

&lt;x.x&gt; is the EDB PgBouncer version.

On Windows, the `.ini` file is located in the following directory:

`C:\Program Files\edb\pgbouncer<x.x>\share\`

&lt;x.x&gt; is the EDB PgBouncer version.

The EDB PgBouncer configuration file is divided into two sections: `[databases]` and `[pgbouncer]`.

The `[databases]` section of the configuration file contains a list of databases and the associated connection information. The configuration file includes an entry for the installation of EDB Postgres Advanced Server that installed EDB PgBouncer:

`edb = host=127.0.0.1 port=5444`

For PostgreSQL Server, you need to enter PostgreSQL server details, such as those shown in the following example.

`postgres = host=127.0.0.1 port=5432`

You can specify more database connection information in the configuration file in the form of `keyword=value` pairs. You can include the parameters shown in the table.

| Parameter  | Description                                                                        |
|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `host`     | The IP address of the host                                                         |
| `port`     | The port on which the host is listening                                            |
| `dbname`   | The (optional) database name                                                       |
| `user`     | A user name (if different from the information specified by the connecting client)  |
| `password` | A password (if different from the information specified by the connecting client)  |

The following example shows the syntax allowed in the `[databases]` section of the configuration file:

``` text
[databases]
edb = host=127.0.0.1 port=5444
postgres = host=127.0.0.1 port=5432
acctg = host=192.168.10.101 port=5432 user=bob password=XXXXXX
```

Include the `dbname` parameter to map the connection name to an alternative database name. For example:

`hr = host=127.0.0.1 port=5445 dbname=humanresources`

When the client provides authentication information, that information is used to connect to EDB PgBouncer. EDB PgBouncer then uses the information specified in the EDB PgBouncer configuration file to connect to the database server. The user information provided in the configuration file must match a role defined in the Postgres database cluster.

!!! Note

    If you don't specify user details in `pgbouncer.ini`, the user name and password are authenticated by the database server and EDB PgBouncer. As such, include the user name and password in the `userlist.txt` file and the database cluster.

The `[pgbouncer]` section of the configuration file contains configuration details specific to EDB PgBouncer:

| Parameter                   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| `admin_users`               | A comma-delimited list of users that are allowed to access the Admin console (for management and monitoring purposes). By default, EDB PgBouncer is installed with `admin_users = enterprisedb`. For the PostgreSQL server, set this value as `admin_users = postgres`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `auth_file`                 | The path to the authentication file that contains user name and passwords of clients that can connect to EDB PgBouncer. The authentication file (`userlist.txt`) is located in `/etc/edb/pgbouncer<x.x>/`, and contains *username/password* pairs that specify the identities that clients can use to access EDB PgBouncer. In the authentication file, specify the user name and password in double quotes. To make changes to the identities that can access EDB PgBouncer, you can edit the existing authentication file or specify an alternative authentication file with the `auth_file` parameter. |
| `auth_type`                 | The authentication method used by EDB PgBouncer. Can be: `md5`, `crypt`, `plain`, `trust`, or `any`.

After editing the EDB PgBouncer configuration file for your environment, restart the EDB PgBouncer service to make the changes take effect. For CentOS, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, RHEL, SUSE, and Windows platforms, the EDB PgBouncer service name is `edb-pgbouncer-1.16`. For Deb packages, the EDB PgBouncer service name is `edb-pgbouncer116`. Use platform-specific commands to stop, start, or restart the service as needed.

## Using the EDB PgBouncer Admin console

The Admin console allows you to retrieve statistical information about EDB PgBouncer activity and to control the EDB PgBouncer process. You can use the edb-psql client to access the EDB PgBouncer Admin console by connecting to the `pgbouncer` database.

The following example connects to the pgbouncer database with the edb-psql client on a Linux system. EDB PgBouncer is listening on port 6432 with a user name of enterprisedb:

Enter following command after navigating to the bin directory under your EDB Postgres Advanced Server installation. That the required connection information varies according to the connecting client, platform, and authentication information required by the server.

`$ ./edb-psql -p 6432 -U enterprisedb pgbouncer`

For PostgreSQL server, the command is:

`$ ./edb-psql -p 6432 -h /tmp -U postgres  pgbouncer`

After connecting to the pgbouncer database, you can use the `SHOW CLIENTS` command to retrieve client-related information:

`# SHOW CLIENTS;`

The `SHOW CLIENTS` command returns:

``` text
--[ RECORD 1]-+--------------------
   type         | C
