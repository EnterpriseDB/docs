Before installing the repository configuration, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user).

Perform the following steps to install EDB PgBouncer on a RHEL 7 PPCLE Host:

1.  Install Advance Toolchain:

    ``` text
    rpm --import https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/Linux/toolchain/at/redhat/RHEL7/gpg-pubkey-6976a827-5164221b

    cat > /etc/yum.repos.d/advance-toolchain.repo <<EOF

    # Begin of configuration file
    [advance-toolchain]
    name=Advance Toolchain IBM FTP
    baseurl=https://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/Linux/toolchain/at/redhat/RHEL7
    failovermethod=priority
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/server/POWER/Linux/toolchain/at/redhat/RHELX/gpg-pubkey-6976a827-5164221b
    # End of configuration file
    EOF
    ```

2.  To install the repository configuration, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:

    ``` text
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

3.  Replace the `USERNAME:PASSWORD` in the following command with the username and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user:

    ``` text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

4.  Before installing EDB PgBouncer, execute the following command to install the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) release package:

    ``` text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

5. Enable the `optional, extras`, and `HA` repositories to satisfy EPEL package dependencies:

    ``` text
    subscription-manager repos --enable "rhel-*-optional-rpms" --enable "rhel-*-extras-rpms"  --enable "rhel-ha-for-rhel-*-server-rpms"
    ```

6.  Invoke the following command to install EDB PgBouncer:

    ``` text
    yum -y install edb-pgbouncer<xx>
    ```

    Where &lt;xx&gt; is the PgBouncer version you want to install.

    When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

    During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve. EDB PgBouncer will be installed in the `/usr/edb/pgbouncer<x.x>` directory.
