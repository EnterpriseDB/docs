Perform the following steps to install EDB PgBouncer on an SLES 12 SP5 host using the zypper package manager.

1.  Assume superuser privileges and use the following command to add the EnterpriseDB repository configuration file to your SLES host:

    ``` text
    zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo
    ```

    This command creates a repository configuration file named `edb.repo` in the `/etc/zypp/repos.d` directory.

3.  Install `SUSEConnect` to register the host with SUSE to allow access to SUSE repositories:

    ``` text
    zypper install SUSEConnect
    ```

4.  Register the host with SUSE to allow access to SUSE repositories and replace `'REGISTRATION_CODE'` and `'EMAIL'` with your SUSE registration information:

    ``` text
    SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'
    SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/x86_64
    SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/x86_64
    ```

5.  Refresh the metadata:

    ``` text
    zypper refresh
    ```

6.  Use the zypper utility to install EDB PgBouncer.

    ``` text
    zypper -n install edb-pgbouncer<xx>
    ```

    Where &lt;xx&gt; is the EDB PgBouncer version you have installed.

EDB PgBouncer will be installed in the `/usr/edb/pgbouncer<xx>` directory.
