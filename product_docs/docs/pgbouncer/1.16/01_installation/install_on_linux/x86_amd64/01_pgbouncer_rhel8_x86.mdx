Before installing the repository configuration, you must have credentials that allow access to the EnterpriseDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user).

Follow the steps given below to install EDB PgBouncer:

1.  To install the repository configuration, assume superuser privileges and invoke the following command:
    ``` text
    dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

2.  Replace the `USERNAME:PASSWORD` in the following command with the username and password of a registered EnterpriseDB user:

    ``` text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

3.  Before installing EDB PgBouncer, execute the following command to install the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) release package:
    ``` text
    dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
    ```

4.  Enable the the `codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-*-rpms` repository to satisfy EPEL packages dependency:
    ``` text
    ARCH=$( /bin/arch )

    subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"
    ```

5.  Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:
    ``` text
    dnf -qy module disable postgresql
    ```

6.  Use the following platform-specific command to install EDB PgBouncer:
    ``` text
    dnf -y install edb-pgbouncer<xx>
    ```

    Where &lt;xx&gt; is the EDB PgBouncer version you want to install.

    To install EDB PgBouncer 1.16 on RHEL 8, the command is:

    ``` text
    dnf -y install edb-pgbouncer116
    ```

    When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

    During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve. EDB PgBouncer will be installed in the `/usr/edb/pgbouncer<x.x>` directory.
