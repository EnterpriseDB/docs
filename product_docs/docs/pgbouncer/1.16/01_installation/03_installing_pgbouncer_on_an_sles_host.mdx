Perform the following steps to install PgBouncer on a SLES 12 SP4 host using the zypper package manager.

1.  Assume superuser privileges and use the following command to add the EnterpriseDB repository configuration file to your SLES host:

    ``` text
    zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo
    ```

    This command creates a repository configuration file named `edb.repo` in the `/etc/zypp/repos.d` directory.

2.  Invoke the following command to refresh the metadata:

    ``` text
    zypper refresh
    ```

3.  Install `SUSEConnect` to register the host with SUSE to allow access to SUSE repositories:

    ``` text
    zypper install SUSEConnect
    ```

4.  Register the host with SUSE to allow access to SUSE repositories and replace `'REGISTRATION_CODE'` and `'EMAIL'` with your SUSE registration information:

    ``` text
    SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'
    SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/x86_64
    SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/x86_64
    ```

5.  Refresh the metadata:

    ``` text
    zypper refresh
    ```

6.  Use the zypper utility to install PgBouncer.

    ``` text
    zypper -n install edb-pgbouncer<xx>
    ```

    Where &lt;xx&gt; is the PgBouncer version you have installed.

PgBouncer will be installed in the `/usr/edb/pgbouncer<xx>` directory.
