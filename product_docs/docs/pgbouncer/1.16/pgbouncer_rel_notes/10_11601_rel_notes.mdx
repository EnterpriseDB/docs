| Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature | Support hot reloading of TLS settings. When the configuration file is reloaded, updated TLS settings are automatically enforced.                                                              |
| Feature | Add support for abstract Unix-domain sockets. Prefix a Unix-domain socket path with `@` to use a socket in the abstract namespace.                                                            |
| Feature | The maximum length of passwords and usernames have been increased to 996 and 128, respectively. Various cloud services require this.                                                          |
| Feature | The minimum pool size can now be set per database, similar to the regular pool size and the reserve pool size.                                                                                |
| Feature | The number of pending query cancellations is shown in SHOW POOLS.                                                                                                                             |
| Bug Fix | Configuration parsing now has tighter error handling in many places. Previously, it might have logged an error and proceeded. Those configuration errors would now result in startup failures.|
| Bug Fix | Query cancel handling has been fixed. Under some circumstances, cancel requests would seemingly get stuck for a long time.                                                                    |
| Bug Fix | Mixed use of md5 and scram via hba has been fixed.                                                                                                                                            |
| Bug Fix | The “FIXME: query end, but query_start == 0” messages have been fixed. The cause of these messages is now known.                                                                              | 
| Bug Fix | Fix reloading of default_pool_size, min_pool_size, and res_pool_size. Previously when these properties were reloaded, it didn’t work.                                                         |
