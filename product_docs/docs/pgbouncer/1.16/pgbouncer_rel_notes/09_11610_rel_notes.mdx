| Security Fix | Make PgBouncer acting as a server reject extraneous data after an SSL or GSS encryption handshake.<br /><br />A man-in-the-middle with the ability to inject data into the TCP connection could stuff some cleartext data into the start of a supposedly encryption-protected database session. This could be abused to send faked SQL commands to the server, although that would only work if PgBouncer did not demand any authentication data. However, a PgBouncer setup relying on SSL certificate authentication might well not do so.|
