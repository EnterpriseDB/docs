When a client application connects to a Postgres server, it negotiates a connection; that negotiation takes time. PgBouncer saves time by maintaining a pool of pre-established connections to the server. Instead of connecting directly to the server, the client connects to PgBouncer, minimizing the connection negotiation time by using a previously established connection made available to the client in the PgBouncer pool.

PgBouncer is a lightweight connection pooling utility for Postgres and Advanced Server installations that is based on the openSource PgBouncer project.

EnterpriseDB enhancements for the PgBouncer project are available via RPM Packages, deb packages, or a graphical installer that you can download with StackBuilder Plus. The enhancements allow PgBouncer to service clients that are using EDB Connectors that require compatible out parameter handling.
