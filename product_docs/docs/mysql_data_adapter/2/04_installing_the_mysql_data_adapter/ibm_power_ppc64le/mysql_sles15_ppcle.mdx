!!!note
EDB provides two repositories:

- EDB's new and improved EDB Repos 2.0

- EDB's legacy EDB Repos 1.0

To access either repository you need an EDB account and credentials. To request credentials, see EDB Repository Access instructions and select **Getting Started**.

The following instructions are specific to EDB Repos 1.0.
!!!

Before you begin the installation process, log in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

## Set up the repository

Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step. If you do need to set up the repository, you must register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

```shell
# Install the repository configuration and enter your EDB repository
# credentials when prompted
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access
# to SUSE repositories
zypper install SUSEConnect

# Register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
# Replace 'REGISTRATION_CODE' and 'EMAIL' with your SUSE
# registration information
SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'

# Install the MySQL community repository
wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-sles12-5.noarch.rpm
rpm --import /etc/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2022

# Enable the MySQL8 repository and disable the MySQL 5 repository
zypper modifyrepo -e mysql80-community
zypper modifyrepo -d mysql57-community

# Activate the required SUSE module
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/15.3/ppc64le

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh
```

## Install the package

```shell
zypper -n install edb-as<xx>-mysql<y>-fdw
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB Postgres Advanced server and `<y>` is the version of MySQL to be installed. For example if EDB Postgres Version is 13 and MySQL version is 8 then the package name is `edb-as13-mysql8-fdw`.
