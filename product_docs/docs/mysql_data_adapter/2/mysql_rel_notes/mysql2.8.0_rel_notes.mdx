Enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper 2.8.0 include:

| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------- |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature     | Push down ORDER BY to remote MySQL servers: When possible, consider a path that adds the ORDER BY clause to the remote SQL to get an ordered result set from the foreign server.  This helps with  an efficient merge join. |
| Feature     | Push down LIMIT/OFFSET to remote MySQL servers: Wherever applicable, perform LIMIT and OFFSET operations on the remote server.  This reduces network traffic between local PostgreSQL and remote MySQL servers.             |
| Enhancement | Add character_set option. Users can now set it to an appropriate value per MySQL database.                                                                                                                                  |
| Enhancement | Add sql_mode option. MySQL server can operate in different SQL modes, this option allows it to match that up.                                                                                                               |
| Bug Fix     | Introduce import_enum_as_text IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA option. When true, mysql_fdw implicitly maps the ENUM column to a TEXT type to import the table successfully without any failure.                                                                                        |
| Bug Fix     | Force correct type modifiers while converting MySQL value to PostgreSQL.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Bug Fix     | Fix text column data truncation when reading very long data.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Bug Fix     | Do not push aggregates with VARIADIC array as MySQL does not support them.                                                                                                                                                  |
