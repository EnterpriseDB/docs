| Type        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------- |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Feature     | Add a configuration file approach to control the pushdowns. We can now provide the list of operators and functions to be pushed down to the remote server safely.             |
| Feature     | Add support for the `import_generated` option in `IMPORT FOREIGN SCHEMA` to include columns generated from expressions in the definitions of foreign tables imported from a foreign server.             |
| Feature     | Add support for the `TRUNCATE` command to truncate foreign tables.                                                                                                                                  |
| Feature     | Add support for `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` in `INSERT`. It is mapping to `INSERT IGNORE`.                                                                                                               |
| Feature     | Add support for `IS [ NOT ] DISTINCT FROM` operator.                                                                                        |
| Bug Fix     | Fix an oversight in assessing the pushdown `ORDER BY` clause. Don't push when underneath `query_pathkeys` is not safe to push down.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Bug Fix     | Fix unstable ordering in the `SQL/select` test.                                                                                                                                                                |
| Bug Fix     | Push down the `LIMIT n` clause when `OFFSET` is `NULL`.                                                                                                                                                 |
