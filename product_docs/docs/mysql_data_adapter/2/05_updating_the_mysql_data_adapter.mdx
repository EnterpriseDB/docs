## Updating an RPM installation

If you have an existing RPM installation of MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper, you can use yum or dnf to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. yum or dnf will update the `edb.repo` file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your `edb.repo` file. Then, you can use yum or dnf to upgrade any installed packages:

- For MySQL 8:

    -  On RHEL or CentOS 7:
       ```text
       sudo yum -y upgrade edb-as<xx>-mysql8_fdw* mysql-community-devel
       ```
    -  On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8:
       ```text
       sudo dnf -y upgrade edb-as<xx>-mysql8_fdw* mysql-community-devel
       ```
- For MySQL 5 on RHEL or CentOS 7:
  ```text
  sudo yum -y upgrade edb-as<xx>-mysql5_fdw* mysql-community-devel
  ```

## Updating MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper on a Debian or Ubuntu host

In the previously released version of MySQL FDW, the package name for MySQL FDW was `edb-as*-mysql-fdw`. In the current release, two separate packages have been made available for MySQL 5 and MySQL 8 i.e `edb-as*-mysql5-fdw` and `edb-as*-mysql8-fdw` Respectively. 

If you are upgrading from MySQL FDW 2.5.5 to 2.6.0 for MySQL 5, then installation of `edb-as*mysql5-fdw` package for version 2.6.0 will automatically remove the previously installed package `edb-as*-mysql-fdw`.

If you are upgrading from MySQL FDW 2.5.5 to 2.6.0 for MySQL 8, then before installing the `edb-as*-mysql8-fdw` package for version 2.6.0, you need to manually remove the following packages:
- `default-mysqlclient-dev` 
- `edb-as*-mysql-fdw`

Use the following command to upgrade the FDW installation:
- For MySQL 8: 
  ```text
  apt-get upgrade edb-as<xx>-mysql8-fdw*
  ```
- For MySQL 5:
  ```text
  apt-get upgrade edb-as<xx>-mysql5-fdw* 
  ```
where `xx` is the server version number.
