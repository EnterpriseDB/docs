## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install Postgres on the same host. See:

  - [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/installing/)

  - [Installing PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Install the EPEL repository

  ```shell
  sudo dnf -y install epel-release
  ```

- Enable additional repositories to resolve dependencies
  ```shell
  sudo dnf config-manager --set-enabled powertools
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-as<xx>-mysql<y>-fdw
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB Postgres Advanced server and `<y>` is the version of MySQL to be installed. For example if EDB Postgres Version is 15 and MySQL version is 8 then the package name is `edb-as15-mysql8-fdw`.
