## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install Postgres on the same host. See:

  - [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/installing/)

  - [Installing PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

- Set up the EDB repository.

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you don't need to perform this step.

  To determine if your repository exists, enter this command:

  `zypper lr -E | grep enterprisedb`

  If no output is generated, the repository isn't installed.

  To set up the EDB repository:

  1. Go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).

  1. Select the button that provides access to the EDB repository.

  1. Select the platform and software that you want to download.

  1. Follow the instructions for setting up the EDB repository.

- Install the MySQL community repository:
  ```shell
  sudo wget https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-sles12-5.noarch.rpm
  rpm --import /etc/RPM-GPG-KEY-mysql-2022
  ```
- Enable the MySQL8 repository and disable the MySQL 5 repository:

  ```shell
  sudo zypper modifyrepo -e mysql80-community
  sudo zypper modifyrepo -d mysql57-community
  ```

- Activate the required SUSE module:
  ```shell
  sudo SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/x86_64
  sudo SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/x86_64

  ```
- Refresh the metadata:
  ```shell
  sudo zypper refresh
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo zypper -n install edb-as<xx>-mysql<y>_fdw
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB Postgres Advanced server and `<y>` is the version of MySQL to be installed. For example if EDB Postgres Version is 15 and MySQL version is 8 then the package name is `edb-as15-mysql8-fdw`.
