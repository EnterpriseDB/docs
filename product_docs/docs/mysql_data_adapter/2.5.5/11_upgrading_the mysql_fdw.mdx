 You can upgrade from MySQL FDW version 2.5.5 to version 2.6.0 by using the `apt-get upgrade` command on Debian or Ubuntu platforms or by using the RPMs provided for RHEL or CentOS platforms. 

### On Debian or Ubuntu

In the previously released version of MySQL FDW, the package name for MySQL FDW was `edb-as*-mysql-fdw`. In the current release, two separate packages have been made available for MySQL 5 and MySQL 8 i.e `edb-as*-mysql5-fdw` and `edb-as*-mysql8-fdw` Respectively. 

If you are upgrading from MySQL FDW 2.5.5 to 2.6.0 for MySQL 5, then installation of `edb-as*mysql5-fdw` package for version 2.6.0 will automatically remove the previously installed package `edb-as*-mysql-fdw`.

If you are upgrading from MySQL FDW 2.5.5 to 2.6.0 for MySQL 8, then before installing the `edb-as*-mysql8-fdw` package for version 2.6.0, you need to manually remove the following packages:
- `default-mysqlclient-dev` 
- `edb-as*-mysql-fdw`

Use the following command to upgrade the FDW installation:
- For MySQL 8: 
```text
apt-get upgrade edb-as13-mysql8-fdw*
```
- For MySQL 5:
```text
apt-get upgrade edb-as13-mysql5-fdw* 
```

### On RHEL or CentOS

- For MySQL 8:
```text
sudo yum -y upgrade edb-as13-mysql8_fdw* mysql-community-devel
```
