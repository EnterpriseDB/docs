**Updating an RPM Installation**

If you have an existing RPM installation of MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper, you can use yum or dnf to upgrade your repository configuration file and update to a more recent product version. To update the `edb.repo` file, assume superuser privileges and enter:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    `yum upgrade edb-repo`

-   On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8:

    `dnf upgrade edb-repo`

yum or dnf will update the `edb.repo` file to enable access to the current EDB repository, configured to connect with the credentials specified in your `edb.repo` file. Then, you can use yum or dnf to upgrade any installed packages:

-   On RHEL or CentOS 7:

    `yum upgrade edb-as<xx>-mysql<x>_fdw`

    where `xx` is the server version number, and `x` is the supported release version number of MySQL. For example, to upgrade MySQL 5.0 on RHEL 7:

    `yum upgrade edb-as<xx>-mysql5_fdw`

-   On RHEL or Rocky Linux or AlmaLinux 8:

    `dnf upgrade edb-as<xx>-mysql8_fdw`

**Updating MongoDB Foreign Data Wrapper on a Debian or Ubuntu Host**

To update MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper on a Debian or Ubuntu Host, use the following command:

> `apt-get --only-upgrade install edb-as<xx>-mysql<x>_fdw`

where `xx` is the server version number, and `x` is the supported release version number of MySQL.
