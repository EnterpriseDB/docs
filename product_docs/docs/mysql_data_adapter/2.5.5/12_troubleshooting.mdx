In case you are experiencing issues with using MySQL 8 and MySQL_FDW, below is a list of solutions to some frequently seen issues:

**Authentication plugin ‘caching_sha2_password’ Error**

```text
ERROR:  failed to connect to MySQL: Authentication plugin ‘caching_sha2_password’ cannot be loaded: /usr/lib64/mysql/plugin/caching_sha2_password.so: cannot open shared  object file: No such file or directory
```

Specify the authentication plugin as `mysql_native_password` and set a cleartext password value. The syntax:

> `ALTER USER 'username'@'host' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '<password>';`

!!! Note
    Refer to [MySQL 8 documentation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/upgrading-from-previous-series.html) for more details on the above error.
