### On RHEL 7

Before installing the MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper, you must install the following prerequisite packages, and request credentials from EDB:

Install the `epel-release` package:

```text
yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
```

Enable the optional, extras, and HA repositories:

```text
subscription-manager repos --enable "rhel-*-optional-rpms" --enable "rhel-*-extras-rpms"  --enable "rhel-ha-for-rhel-*-server-rpms"
```

You must also have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

<https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf>

After receiving your repository credentials you can:

1.  Create the repository configuration file.
2.  Modify the file, providing your user name and password.
3.  Install the MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper.

**Creating a Repository Configuration File**

To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges, and invoke the following command:

```text
yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

**Modifying the file, providing your user name and password**

After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to ensure that the value of the `enabled` parameter is `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EDB user.

```text
[edb]
name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```

**Installing MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper**

1. Before installing MySQL FDW, download and install the MySQL repo using the following commands:
 
   ```text
   yum -y install https://dev.mysql.com/get/mysql80-community-release-el7-3.noarch.rpm
   ```

2. Use the following command to enable the appropriate subrepository and install the MySQL Foreign data Wrapper:
 - For MySQL 8:
   ```text
   yum -y install --enablerepo=mysql80-community --disablerepo=mysql57-community edb-as<xx>-mysql8_fdw
   ```
 - For MySQL 5: 
   ```text
   yum -y install --enablerepo=mysql57-community --disablerepo=mysql80-community edb-as<xx>-mysql5_fdw
   ```
Where `xx` is the server version number i.e. 13.

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.

## Installing the MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper on a Debian or Ubuntu Host

To install the MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper on a Debian or Ubuntu host, you must have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, visit the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request/).

The following steps will walk you through on using the EDB apt repository to install a DEB package. When using the commands, replace the `username` and `password` with the credentials provided by EDB.

1.  Assume superuser privileges:
   ```text
   sudo su –
   ```

2.  Configure the EnterpriseDB repository:

    On Debian 9:

    ```text
    sh -c 'echo "deb https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
    ```

    On Debian 10, Ubuntu 18, and Ubuntu 20:

    1.  Set up the EDB repository:

    ```text
    sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb/ $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'
    ```

    2.  Substitute your EDB credentials for the `username` and `password` in the following command:

    ```text
    sh -c 'echo "machine apt.enterprisedb.com login <username> password <password>" > /etc/apt/auth.conf.d/edb.conf'
    ```

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

   ```text
   apt-get install apt-transport-https
   ```

4.  Add the EBD signing key:

   ```text
   wget -q -O - https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add -
   ```
5. If there is `libmysqlclient-dev` already installed on your system, remove it by using the following command:
   ```text
   sudo apt-get remove  libmysqlclient-dev
   ```

6. Enable the MySQL repo by using the apporpriate command:
- For Debian 9:
    - For MySQL 8: 
    ```text
    sudo echo "deb http://repo.mysql.com/apt/debian/stretch mysql-8.0" | sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mysql.list
    ```
    - For MySQL 5: 
    ```text
    sudo echo "deb http://repo.mysql.com/apt/debian/stretch mysql-5.7" | sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mysql.list
    ```

- For Debian 10:
    - For MySQL 8: 
    ```text
    sudo echo "deb http://repo.mysql.com/apt/debian/buster mysql-8.0" | sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mysql.list
    ```
    - For MySQL 5: 
    ```text
    sudo echo "deb http://repo.mysql.com/apt/debian/buster mysql-5.7" | sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mysql.list
    ```

- For Ubuntu 18:
    - For MySQL 8: 
    ```text
    sudo echo "deb http://repo.mysql.com/apt/ubuntu/bionic mysql-8.0" | sudo tee  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mysql.list
    ```
    - For MySQL 5: 
    ```text
    sudo echo "deb http://repo.mysql.com/apt/ubuntu/bionic mysql-5.7" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mysql.list
    ```
  Note that you do not need to enable the MySQL repo on Ubuntu 20.

7.  Add the mysql repo key using the following commands:

   ```text
   sudo apt-key adv --keyserver pgp.mit.edu --recv-keys 5072E1F5
   ```
8. Update the repository metadata:

   ```text
   apt-get update
   ```

9.  Install DEB package:

   ```text
   apt-get install edb-as<xx>-mysql<y>-fdw
   ```
  Where `xx` is the server version number i.e. 13 and `y` is the MySQL version i.e. 5 or 8.
