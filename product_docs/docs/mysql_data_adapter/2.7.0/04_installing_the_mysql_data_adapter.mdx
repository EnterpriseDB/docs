### On RHEL 8 x86_64

Before installing the MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper, you must install the following prerequisite packages, and request credentials from EDB:

Install the `epel-release` package:

```text
dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
```

Enable the `codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-\*-rpms` repository:

```text
ARCH=$( /bin/arch )
subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"
```

You must also have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit:

<https://www.enterprisedb.com/user/login>

After receiving your repository credentials you can:

1.  Create the repository configuration file.
2.  Modify the file, providing your user name and password.
3.  Install the MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper.

**Creating a Repository Configuration File**

To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges, and invoke the following command:

```text
dnf -y https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
```

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`. The file resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

**Modifying the file, providing your user name and password**

After creating the `edb.repo` file, use your choice of editor to ensure that the value of the `enabled` parameter is `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the name and password of a registered EDB user.

```text
[edb]
name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
repo_gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY
```
**Installing MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper**

After saving your changes to the configuration file, use the below command to install the MySQL Foreign Data Wrapper:

```text
dnf install edb-as<xx>-mysql8_fdw
```
Where `xx` is the server version number i.e. 13.

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, yum may ask for your permission to import the key to your local server. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

During the installation, yum may encounter a dependency that it cannot resolve. If it does, it will provide a list of the required dependencies that you must manually resolve.
