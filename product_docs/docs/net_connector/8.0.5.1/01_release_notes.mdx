| Bug fix        | Fixed a performance issue. Performance is now improved when reading data while targeting .NET Framework 4.7.2, 4.8, and 4.8.1.                                                                                                                     | #41979    |
| Enhancement    | Added support for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 17.2.                                                                                                                                                                                               |           |
| Enhancement    | Added support for `IS TABLE OF`. EDB Postgres Advanced Server supports Oracle nested table collection types created with `CREATE TYPE ... AS TABLE OF` statements. See [Using nested tables](./using_nested_table_types.mdx) for more information. |           |
| Deprecation    | Removed .NET5, .NET6, and .NET7 targets as they have reached end of support.                                                                                                                                                                       |           |
