For information about using the API, see the [Npgsql documentation](http://www.npgsql.org/doc/api/Npgsql.html).

Usage notes:

-   When using the API, replace references to `Npgsql` with `EnterpriseDB.EDBClient`.
-   When referring to classes, replace `Npgsql` with `EDB`. For example, use the `EDBBinaryExporter` class instead of the `NpgsqlBinaryExporter` class.
-   To determine which Npgsql API version was included with a specific EDB .NET release, refer to the [EDB .NET release notes](release_notes). The release notes specify the upstream Npgsql version that was merged. This is important because the availability of certain API features may vary between versions.
