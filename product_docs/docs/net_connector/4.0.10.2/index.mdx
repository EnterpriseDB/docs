The EDB Postgres Advanced Server .NET Connector distributed with EDB Postgres Advanced Server (Advanced Server) provides connectivity between a .NET client application and an Advanced Server database server. This guide provides installation instructions, usage instructions, and examples that demonstrate the functionality of the Advanced Server .NET Connector:

-   How to connect to an instance of Advanced Server.
-   How to retrieve information from an Advanced Server database.
-   How to update information stored on an Advanced Server database.

This document assumes that you have a solid working knowledge of both C\# and .NET. The Advanced Server .NET Connector functionality is built on the core functionality of the Npgsql open source project. The *Npgsql User's Manual* is available [online](http://www.npgsql.org/doc/index.html).
