!!!note

   Npgsql introduced in version 10 a [breaking change regarding `DateOnly` and `TimeOnly `set as default mappings](https://www.npgsql.org/doc/release-notes/10.0.html#date-and-time-are-now-mapped-to-dateonly-and-timeonly).
   EDB .NET Connector does not contain this breaking change, and `DateTime` and `TimeSpan` are still the default mappings to their PostgreSQL date/time counterparts.
