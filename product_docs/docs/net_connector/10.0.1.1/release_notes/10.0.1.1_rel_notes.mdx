Released: 21 Feb 2026

The EDB .NET Connector provides connectivity between a .NET client application and an EDB Postgres Advanced Server database server.

!!!note

    Unlike the upstream Npgsql community driver, the EDB .NET Connector retains full support for .NET Framework 4.7.2+.

New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in the EDB .NET Connector `10.0.1.1` include:

!!!note

   In version 10, Npgsql introduced a [breaking change regarding `DateOnly` and `TimeOnly `set as default mappings](https://www.npgsql.org/doc/release-notes/10.0.html#date-and-time-are-now-mapped-to-dateonly-and-timeonly).
   EDB .NET Connector doesn't contain this breaking change, and `DateTime` and `TimeSpan` are still the default mappings to their PostgreSQL date/time counterparts.
