The following features have been added to the EDB Ark user console for this release.

**Administrative Features are documented in the EDB Postgres Ark Administrative User's Guide**

-   An administrative user can use options on the `Admin` tab to download a zip file that contains the Ark core usage logs.
-   An Administrative user can configure the Ark console to enforce SAML authentication.
-   An Administrative user can specify how long the Ark console will retain event information for deleted clusters.
-   An Administrative user can modify cluster settings to allow non-SSL database connections.

**User Features are documented in the EDB Postgres Ark Getting Started Guide**

-   The `Monitoring` tab now features a replication lag graph; delays in replication are noted for each node of a cluster.
-   A `Template Filter` makes it easier to find a specific template when deploying an Ark cluster.
-   The `Clusters` tab now features a `Restart/Reload` button that you can use to restart or reload the database server on one or more nodes.
-   You can download database server, PEM, or pgPool log files from the `Clusters` tab; right click a node name in the `Details` panel, and select the log file you wish to download from the drop-down menu.
-   The `Clusters` tab now features a replication lag chart on the `Monitoring` panel.
-   Ark 3.4 supports *federated* clusters. If an administrator has configured the Ark console to support federated consoles, you may create and manage clusters with nodes in multiple regions.
-   The Ark 3.4 console now displays the date and time for backup and recovery points in the time zone of the local user.
-   Ark 3.4 now features an updated `Dashboard` tab; the `Resources` panel displays resource usage (instances, snapshots, and volumes) for each role on the console.
-   When applicable, the elastic IP address of a cluster is displayed on the cluster `Details` panel.

**API Features are documented in the EDB Postgres Ark API User's Guide**

-   A call to the `/options/provider-name` resource returns the name of the service provider.
-   A call to the `/options/regions` resource returns a list of available regions.
-   The `/consoleurls` and `/consoleurls/id` resources have been updated to support federated consoles.
-   You can use the /owners/name/clusters resource to manage federated consoles.

## Limitations

**Cloning, Recovering, or Scaling Encrypted Clusters from Previous Versions**

Encrypted clusters created with Ark 3.3 or prior may not be used to clone, recover, or scale to a machine type that is not supported by that earlier version. If you will be moving encrypted clusters created with Ark version 3.3 or prior to a new machine type (as supported by Ark 3.4), you will need to:

1.  Clone the encrypted cluster to a new, unencrypted cluster.
2.  Upgrade the Ark console on which the cluster resides to Ark 3.4.
3.  Clone the unencrypted cluster to a new encrypted cluster of the new machine type.

For detailed information about cloning a cluster, see the *EDB Postgres Ark Getting Started Guide*.

**Cloning with a Template from a Foreign Region**

You cannot use a template when cloning from a foreign region.

**Monitoring a Federated Console with PEM**

Ark does not support federated consoles configured in local PEM server mode.

**Federating Consoles that host clusters with the Same Name**

If you are upgrading to version 3.4, and plan to federate existing Ark version 3.3 consoles that host clusters with the same name, you must first create a clone of one of the clusters specifying an alternate name; federated consoles cannot be used to host clusters with the same name. For example, if you plan to federate two consoles that both contain a cluster named `acctg`, you should clone one of the clusters specifying an alternate name for the cluster (i.e. `acctg-west`). Then, you can federate the consoles; both consoles will have access to `acctg` and `acctg-west`.
