<div id="ark_installing_console_aws" class="registered_link"></div>


The EDB Ark console is distributed through the Amazon AWS Marketplace in an Amazon machine instance. To install the Ark console on your Amazon instance, you will need to:

-   Launch an [Ark instance](../06_ark_installing_console/#launch_ark_aws) with an Amazon AWS Marketplace AMI.
-   Create an [Amazon role](../06_ark_installing_console/#creating_aws_service_user) and [register an administrative user](../06_ark_installing_console/#creating_aws_service_role) .
-   Configure the [Ark console](../06_ark_installing_console/#config_ark_console) .
-   Create an Amazon role and [register an Ark console user](../06_ark_installing_console/#create_aws_role_register_ark_user) .

<div id="launch_ark_aws" class="registered_link"></div>



## Launching the Ark Console Instance on AWS

Before launching an AMI into an Amazon VPC, you must ensure that the VPC has access to an [Internet Gateway](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Internet_Gateway.html). If your VPC does not have access to an Internet Gateway, you can use the Amazon management console to create an Internet Gateway and associate it with your VPC.

Please note: if you are using EC2-Classic networking, you do not need to provide an Internet Gateway.

To launch an Amazon EC2 instance that contains a running copy of the Ark console and the Ark console's backing database, connect to your Amazon AWS Marketplace account and locate the AMI that contains the Ark console. Navigate through the introductory page for the AMI, selecting AWS service options that are appropriate to your application, and agreeing to the `Terms and Conditions`. When you agree to the `Terms and Conditions`, Amazon will process the subscription.

After you subscribe, Amazon will forward an email to the address associated with your user account that includes [launch instructions](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/launching-instance.html) for the AMI.

Then, use the Amazon launch wizard to launch your instance, noting the requirements that follow on `Step 3` and `Step 6` of the wizard.

![*Step 3 - Enabling the startup script*](../images/ark_installing_console_aws_step_3_details.png)

When configuring your instance, you should include the following selections on the `Step 3: Configure Instance Details` dialog of the Amazon launch wizard:

-   Use the `Auto-assign Public IP` drop-down to specify Enable to automatically assign an IP address to the new instance.
-   Use the `Advanced Details` section to provide the text of the script that will start the Ark console setup or recovery dialog.

<!-- -->

    #!/bin/sh
    rm -f /usr/share/tomcat/startup-password.txt
    echo "<console_password>" > /usr/share/tomcat/startup-password.txt
    chown tomcat:tomcat /usr/share/tomcat/startup-password.txt
    chmod 600 /usr/share/tomcat/startup-password.txt

Replace the `<console_password>` variable in the script with a password for the console. When the user first connects to the AWS Ark console, they will be required to provide the console password provided in the script.

Continue through the launch wizard; please note that when configuring your security group, the group must allow communication between the nodes of the cluster. When defining the security group, include the rules listed in the table below.

| Rule Type  | Direction | Port or Range | Remote | CIDR Address |
|------------|-----------|---------------|--------|--------------|
| All ICMP   | Ingress   |               | CIDR   | 0.0.0.0/0    |
| SSH        |           |               | CIDR   | 0.0.0.0/0    |
| HTTP       |           |               | CIDR   | 0.0.0.0/0    |
| HTTPS      |           |               | CIDR   | 0.0.0.0/0    |
| Custom TCP | Ingress   | 6666          | CIDR   | 0.0.0.0/0    |
| Custom TCP | Ingress   | 7800 to 7999  | CIDR   | 0.0.0.0/0    |
| Custom TCP | Ingress   | 5432          | CIDR   | 0.0.0.0/0    |

**Please Note:**

-   The CIDR addresses specified in the rules for SSH, HTTP, HTTPS, and 5432 can be customized to restrict access to a limited set of users.
-   The CIDR addresses specified for port 6666 and ports 7800 through 7999 must specify a value of `0.0.0.0/0`.
-   The Custom TCP rule that opens ports 7800 through 7999 provides enough ports for 200 cluster connections; the upper limit of the port range can be extended if more than 200 clusters are required.

## Creating the Amazon AWS Service User and Service Role

Before configuring the Ark console on an Amazon host and creating users, you must create an Amazon service user and service role. Ark uses the service role when performing Ark management functions (such as console backups). The Ark console uses the service role credentials (the cross account keys) to assume the IAM roles assigned to Ark users. This enables Ark to securely manage AWS resources. When configuring the Ark console, you are required to provide the setup dialog with details about the AWS service user and the service role. Specify:

-   the Amazon Role ARN (resource name) that will be used by the Ark service in the `Service Account Role ARN` field.
-   the Amazon external ID that will be used by the Ark service user in the `Service Account External ID` field.
-   the AWS\_ACCESS\_KEY\_ID associated with the AWS role used for account administration in `AWS Access Key` field.
-   the AWS\_SECRET\_ACCESS\_KEY associated with the AWS role used for account administration in `AWS Secret Key` field.

## Creating an Amazon Role and Registering an Ark Console User

After deploying the console, you must create an Amazon role with an associated security policy that will be applied to the Ark console user. You can use the same security policy for multiple users, or create additional Amazon roles with custom security policies for additional users. Each time you register a user, you will be prompted for a Role ARN. The Role ARN determines which security policy will be applied to that user.

To define an Amazon role, connect to the Amazon management console, and navigate through the `Identity and Access Management` dashboard to the `Roles` dashboard, and click the `Create role` button.

![*The Create role dialog*](../images/ark_installing_console_aws_create_iam_role.png)

When the `Create role` dialog opens, select the `AWS service button` and highlight the `EC2` bar, and click `Next: Permissions` to continue.

![*The Attach permissions policies dialog*](../images/ark_installing_console_aws_iam_role_perm.png)

When the `Attach permissions policies` dialog opens, do not specify a policy; instead, click `Next: Review` to continue.

![*The Review dialog*](../images/ark_installing_console_aws_iam_role_review.png)

Use the `Review` dialog to provide a name and a description; then, click `Create role`. The role will be displayed in the role list on the Amazon `IAM Roles` page. Highlight the role name to review account details.

![*The Summary dialog*](../images/ark_installing_console_aws_iam_role_summary.png)

The *Summary* dialog will display a Role ARN, but the ARN will not be enabled until the security policy and trust policy are updated.

After completing the `Create Role` wizard, you must modify the inline policy and trust relationship (defined by the security policy) to allow Ark to use the role. Click the `Add inline policy` link to add a security policy. Then, copy the [permission policy text](../#ark_aws_iam_role_permission_policy) into the `JSON` tab.

-   Enter your first and last names in the `First Name` and `Last Name` fields.
-   Enter a password that will be associated with the user account, and confirm the password in the `Password` and `Verify Password` fields.
-   Provide an email address in the `Email` field; please note that the email address is used as the Login identity for the user.
-   Use the drop-down listbox in the `Cloud Provider` field to select the host on which the cloud will reside.
-   Enter the name of the company with which you are associated in the `Company Name` field.

When you've completed `Step 1`, click `Next` to open the `Step 2` tab. The `Step 2` tab of the `New User Registration` dialog will display a random `External ID` number. Copy the `External ID` from the `Step 2` dialog into the trust policy, replacing `EDB-ARK-SERVICE`. Please note that you must enclose the External ID in double-quotes ("). Click the `Update Trust Policy` button to save your edits and exit the dialog.

![*The Summary tab of the Role detail panel*](../images/ark_installing_console_aws_role_detail.png)

Your Amazon IAM role ARN is displayed on the Amazon role detail panel.

![*Registering a user on an Amazon EC2 cloud*](../images/ark_installing_console_aws_reg_step_2.png)

Enter your Amazon IAM role ARN in the `Role Arn` field on the `Step 2` dialog, and click `Finish` to complete the registration. Select `Cancel` to exit without completing the registration.

After registering your user identity and connection information, you are ready to log in to the Ark console.

![*The Login/Register dialog*](../images/ark_installing_console_aws_ark_login.png)

Provide the email address in the `Email` field, and the associated password in the `Password` field, and click `Log In` to connect to the Ark management console.

In preparation for non-administrative user to connect, an Administrator should:

1.  Use the Ark console to define a server image for each server that will host a database cluster. For detailed information about using the Ark console to create server ../images, see [Creating a Server Image](../#ark_using_admin_tab).
2.  Use the Ark console to create database engine definitions. For detailed information about defining a database engine, see [Creating a Database Engine](../#ark_using_admin_tab)
