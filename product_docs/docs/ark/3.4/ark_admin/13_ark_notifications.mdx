EDB Ark will send e-mail notifications when:

-   The state of a monitored database cluster changes.
-   An administrative action is performed on a cluster
-   User information changes.

Please note: For EDB Ark notifications to function properly, you must have an SMTP server running on each node, and provide contact email addresses for the Ark administrator and Ark user.

| OS/SW Status is now: *status*                                       | The OS/SW status on node *dns\_name* of cluster *cluster\_name* is now CRITICAL. This indicates that the node has at least one outstanding security update and possibly other non-critical updates available. Please log into the EDB Ark console and perform a cluster upgrade.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| OS/SW Status is now: *status*                                       | The OS/SW status on node *dns\_name* of cluster *cluster\_name* is now UNKNOWN. This indicates that the node is having difficulty determining the OS/SW status. This may be a temporary issue that will resolve itself. Please log into the EDB Ark console and check your clusters status. If it is still showing status UNKNOWN then you will need to log into node *dns\_name* and run "yum --security check-update" to diagnose the issue manually. |
| Unable to delete Security Group *group\_name*                       | The system was not able to delete the Security Group named *group\_name* in cluster *cluster\_name*. This could be because one or more instances in the cluster could not be terminated. This Security Group will need to be manually deleted from the provider's management console.                                                                                                                                                                   |
