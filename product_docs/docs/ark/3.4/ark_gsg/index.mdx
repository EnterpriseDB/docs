**EDB Postgres Ark**

EDB Ark automatically provisions PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server databases in single instances, high-availability clusters, or application development sandboxes. EDB Ark frees DBAs and application developers from the rigors of setting up and administering robust database environments. In minutes, EDB Ark configures a cluster of database machines with:

-   Streaming replication
-   Connection pooling
-   Load balancing
-   Automatic failover (transaction or recovery time preferred)
-   Secure data encryption
-   Rotating user-scheduled backups
-   Point-in-time recovery
-   Elastic storage
-   Elastic scale out

EDB Ark's automatic scaling of storage resources and scale out of read replicas when a database cluster reaches user-defined thresholds provides unattended, around-the-clock responsiveness to unpredictable load demands on your database infrastructure.

This document will demonstrate how to use the EDB Ark console successfully in your cloud-based database management activities.
