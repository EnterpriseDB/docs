The Ark console has four browser tabs that help you to manage clusters that reside in an AWS or Azure cloud:

-   The `Dashboard` tab provides an overview of the current resources in use, a quick-start Launch DB Cluster button, and (optionally), links to documentation and tutorials.
-   The `Clusters` tab provides a management and information resources for your clusters.
-   The `Backups` tab provides a list of the existing snapshots of your Ark clusters and buttons that allow you to create or delete a snapshot.
-   The `User` tab provides a graphical management interface that you can use to review and manage your user account information.

Please note that some features of the Ark console are not available to a [Template Only](#template_only_user) user.
