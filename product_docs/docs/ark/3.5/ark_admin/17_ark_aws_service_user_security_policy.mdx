When you define an Amazon service user, you are required to provide an inline security policy. You can use the following security policy when registering a service user:

``` json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "Stmt1389628412000",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "sts:GetFederationToken",
                "sts:AssumeRole" 
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "*" 
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
