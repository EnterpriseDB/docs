Some features of the Ark Administrative console will not work properly when pop-up blocker (or Ad blocker) software is enabled. To take full advantage of console features, you should disable pop-up blocker software from restricting pop-ups from the URL/s used by the Ark console or Ark clusters. After disabling pop-up blocker software for your console, follow the platform specific steps to deploy an Ark console:

  - If your cluster resides on an Amazon public cloud, see [Installing the Ark Console on AWS](#ark_installing_console_aws) for more information.
  - If your cluster uses an Azure host, see [Installing the Ark Console on Azure](#ark_installing_console_azure) for more information.
