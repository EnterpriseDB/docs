The EDB Postgres Ark image is available on Azure Marketplace; installation and configuration is a simple process. To enable the Ark console on Azure, you must:

Create an [Azure user account with sufficient privileges](#provide_access_azure) to access the Ark Administrator's console.\`  Create an [Azure network security group](#azure_security_group) .

Create an [Azure storage account](#azure_storage_account).  Launch a [VM Image](#azure_launch_ark_console) that contains the Ark console.

Configure the [Ark console](#azure_configure_ark_console).  Register an [Ark Administrative user](#azure_register_user).

<div id="provide_access_azure" class="registered_link"></div>

## Providing Administrative Access to an Azure User

To provide sufficient privileges for an Azure user account to access the Ark administrative console, navigate to the `Azure Resource groups` panel, highlight the name of the resource group in which your instance will reside, and select `Access control (IAM)` from the `Resources` panel; then, click the `+Add` button to access the `Add permissions` panel.

On the `Add permissions` panel, use the drop-down listbox in the `Role` field to select `Owner`; use the drop-down listbox in the `Select` field to select the user(s) that should have administrative access to the Ark console. When you've made your selections, click `Save`.

To limit the scale of the access to the resource group in which the image resides, use the `Resources – Access control (IAM)` panel to specify a value of `This resource` in the `scale` field for the specified user(s).

For more information about delegating Azure permissions, please [see the Azure documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/role-based-access-control-configure).

<div id="azure_security_group" class="registered_link"></div>

## Creating a Security Group

Before connecting to the Ark console, you must create a security group that will allow connections from your web browser, and between the Ark console and your instance. To create a security group, navigate to the Microsoft Azure `Network security groups` page, and click the `Add` button. When the `Create network security group` panel opens:

-   Use the `Name` field to provide a name for the security group.
-   Use the drop-down listbox in the `Subscription` field to select a subscription plan.
-   Use the `Resource` group field to provide a name for the associated resource group, or highlight the Use existing radio button and use the drop-down listbox in the Resource group field to select an existing resource group.
-   Use the `Location` drop-down listbox to specify a location.

When you've finished, click `Create` to create a network security group.

After creating the network security group, you must provide the inbound rules that will allow the Ark console to manage your instance. On the Network security groups page, click the name of the security group that you wish to modify; click `Inbound security rules` (in the `SETTINGS` section of the details panel) to modify the inbound rules for the group.

To add a new rule, click the `Add` button, and provide details about the rule; after providing rule details, click `OK`. The Azure console will notify you that it is creating the new rule. When defining the security group, include the rules listed below:

| Rule Type               | Direction | Port                         | Remote              | CIDR Address                            |
| ----------------------- | --------- | ---------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| All ICMP SSH HTTP HTTPS | Ingress   |                              | CIDR CIDR CIDR CIDR | 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Custom TCP              | Ingress   | 6666                         | CIDR                | 0.0.0.0/0                               |
| Custom TCP              | Ingress   | port range from 7800 to 7999 | CIDR                | 0.0.0.0/0                               |
| Custom TCP              | Ingress   | 5432                         | CIDR                | 0.0.0.0/0                               |

The CIDR addresses specified in the rules for SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS can be customized to restrict access to a limited set of users. The CIDR addresses specified for port `6666` and ports `7800 through 7999` must specify a value of `0.0.0.0/0`.

The rule that opens ports `7800` through `7999` provides enough ports for 200 cluster connections; you can extend the upper limit of the port range if more than 200 clusters are required.

-   Update the `User` tab, providing a `Notification Email`. For more information about the User tab, see the `EDB Ark Getting Started Guide`, available on the Ark `Dashboard`.
-   Use the [Admin tab](../08_ark_admin_tab/#ark_using_admin_tab) to create the server images and database engines that will be used by non-administrative users.
