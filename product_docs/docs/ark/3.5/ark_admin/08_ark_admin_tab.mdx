Use options on the `Admin` tab to perform administrative tasks such as creating federations of consoles, managing servers and database engines, and defining templates. You can also use the `Admin` tab to manage users and deployment properties.

![*The Admin tab.*](images/ark_admin_features_admin_tab.png)

Fig. 8.1: The Admin tab.

**Console Manager**

Use the fields in the `Console Manager` panel to:

-   Make a console available through the `Consoles` drop-down navigation listbox on the Ark console.
-   Generate a token that can be used to configure the current console as part of a *federation* of Ark consoles. A federated console can deploy resources (such as standby servers) on another console that resides in another region.
-   Register other consoles with the current console as part of a *federation* of consoles.

For more information, see [Using the Console Manager](#using-the-console-manager).

**Server Type Administration**

A fresh installation of EDB Ark will include default database engine configurations for:

-   EDB Postgres Advanced Server 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 10.0, and 11 (64-bit)
-   PostgreSQL 9.4, 9.5, 9.6, 10.0, and 11 (64-bit)

For information about adding additional servers, see [Managing Server Images](#managing-server-images).

**DB Engine Administration**

The databases made available through the `DB Engine Administration` panel will be disabled and will not have an associated server type or valid repository information. To make a database available for end users, you must:

-   Create one or more server images that correspond to a server that resides on your system. For more information about defining a server type, see [Managing Server Images](#managing-server-images).
-   Use the `Edit Engine Details` button to modify existing engine definitions to specify a server image associated with the engine and repository information (if applicable), and enable the engine for use by end-users.

For more information, see [Managing Database Engines](#managing-database-engines).

**Template Administration**

Use the `Template Administration` panel to create and manage database cluster templates. A template contains a predefined set of server options that determine the configuration of a cluster.

An administrator can use a template to:

-   simplify creation of clusters that use a common configuration.
-   predefine supported cluster configurations.
-   limit access to server resources for a *Template Only* user. A Template Only user must use a template when deploying a new cluster.

For more information about creating and using a template, see [Template Administration](#template-administration).

**RHEL Subscription Management**

Options in the `RHEL Subscription Management` panel allow you to:

-   Add, modify, or delete RHEL subscription information.

For more information, see [Red Hat Subscription Management](#red-hat-subscription-management).

**IAM Roles Administration (AWS only)**

Options in the `IAM Roles Administration` panel allow you to:

-   Make Amazon ARNs available for use in Ark user accounts (AWS).

For information about user administration options, see [Managing Amazon Roles](#managing-amazon-roles).

**User Administration**

Options in the `User Administration` panel allow you to:

-   If applicable, manage user accounts.
-   Access a list of currently connected users.
-   Display a banner message to connected users.
-   Specify that a user must use a template when deploying a cluster.

For information about user administration options, see [User Administration](#user-administration).

**Download Console Logs**

Click the `Download` button in the `Download Console Logs` panel to download a zip file that contains the server logs for the underlying application server. You can use the log file to confirm changes to server status or verify server activity.

For more information, see [Accessing the Console Logs](#accessing-the-console-logs).

**Download Core Usage Logs**

Click the `Download` button in the `Download Core Usage Logs` panel to download a zip file that contains the usage logs for the underlying server.

For more information, see [Accessing the Core Usage Logs](#accessing-the-core-usage-logs).

**Backup Ark Console**

Click the `Backup Now` button to start a console backup. A popup will confirm that you have requested a manual backup of the console.

For more information, see [Taking a Manual Backup of the Console](#taking-a-manual-backup-of-the-console).

**Edit Installation Properties**

Click the `Edit installation properties` button to open a dialog that allows you to modify the Ark console configuration. For more information, see [Editing Installation Properties](#editing-installation-properties).

## Using the Console Manager

Use fields in the `Console Manager` panel to manage the names and links displayed by the `Consoles` drop-down listbox on the Ark console. You can also use the Console Manager to manage federated consoles and provide access to cross-region resources. The console manager provides access to optional functionality; if you are not federating consoles or do not wish to use the `Consoles` drop-down, you are not required to complete the fields in the panel.

For more information about creating and using federated consoles, see [Using the Console Manager to Create a Federated Console](#register_federated_console).

![*The Consoles drop-down.*](images/ark_admin_tab_console_switcher.png)

Fig. 8.2: The Consoles drop-down.

The `Consoles` drop-down listbox (in the upper-right corner of the Ark console) provides quick access to other consoles. When you select a name from the `Consoles` drop-down listbox, the Ark console opens a browser tab and navigates to the address associated with the name. Use the `Console Manager` section of the `Admin` tab to manage the console names and addresses that are displayed in the `Consoles` drop-down.

![*The Console Manager panel*](images/ark_admin_tab_console_switcher_pane.png)

Fig. 8.3: The Console Manager panel

To enable the `Consoles` drop-down, you must first provide a name for the console to which you are currently connected in the `Name for this Console` field.

![*Provide a name for the console.*](images/ark_admin_tab_console_switcher_enable.png)

Fig. 8.4: Provide a name for the console

After providing the console name, click the `Save Name` button to display the name of the console in the upper-left corner of the Ark console, and in the `Consoles` drop-down. To add a shortcut to another console, click the `Add URL` button; the `Add URL` dialog opens.

![*Saving the console name.*](images/ark_admin_tab_console_switcher_add_url.png)

Fig. 8.5: Saving the console name.

Then, use the `Add Console` dialog to provide information about the console for which you are creating a `Consoles` entry:

-   Provide a user-friendly name in the `Name` field.
-   Provide the URL of the console in the `Url` field; please note that the URL must be prefixed with the http protocol identifier.
-   Optionally, provide the API token associated with the console in the `API Token` field. This field is only required when you are federating consoles.

When you're finished, click the `Save` button to add the console to the list displayed on the `Consoles` drop-down.

To modify an entry in the `Consoles` drop-down, highlight the name of the console in the `NAME` column and click the `Edit URL` button. After modifying the console details on the `Edit URL` dialog, click the `Apply` button to preserve the changes. Click `Cancel` to exit the dialog without saving your changes.

To remove a URL, highlight the name of the URL in the `NAME` column and click the `Delete URL` button. A dialog will open, asking you to confirm that you wish to delete the URL.

![*Deleting a console.*](images/ark_admin_tab_console_switcher_delete_url.png)

Fig. 8.6: Deleting a console.

Click the `Delete` button to confirm that you want to remove the entry from the `Consoles` drop-down and delete the entry from the `Console Manager` table, or click `Cancel` to exit the dialog without deleting the entry.

<div id="register_federated_console" class="registered_link"></div>

### Using the Console Manager to Create a Federated Console

You can use fields in the `Console Manager` panel to generate and share access tokens between consoles to create a *federation* of consoles. After creating a federation, you can create or clone cluster members in any region in which one of the federated consoles resides. A federated console may have resources that reside in more than one region; standby nodes that reside in other regions will reflect the state of the master node.

!!! Note
    Each federation may only contain one console from a specific region; if you try to add more than one console from a given region to a federation, Ark will return an error.

When creating a federation, please note:

-   All of the federated consoles must be configured with the same set of database engines and server images:

    -   Each database engine must have the same configuration across all federated consoles (including the engine id and name).
    -   Each server image must have the same configuration across all federated consoles; the image id will vary by region.

For example, you might have two consoles; one that resides in Region `us-east-1` and one that resides in Region `us-east-2`. You can create a federation of those consoles by *registering* the consoles with each other. After registering the consoles (sharing the URL and token of each console within the federation with the other console), you will be allowed to select the `Region` in which replica nodes are created or cloned.

![*Selecting a region.*](images/ark_admin_tab_create_cross_region.png)

!!! Note
    Standby nodes that reside in a different region than the master console will be used for load balancing. Failover to nodes that reside on a different region than the master node is not supported. If a master node fails and you do not have a standby node in the same region as the master node, Ark will create a replacement node in the same region as the original master.

All of the resources that reside on federated consoles will be visible on the `Clusters` tab of all of the consoles within the federation. To federate consoles you must:

1.  Use the `Name for this Console` field to create a name for each console that will be federated. Click within the field and provide a console name; when finished, click the `Save Name` button. The console name will be displayed on the title bar of the Ark console.

![*Providing a console name.*](images/ark_admin_tab_name_console.png)

Fig. 8.8: Providing a console name.

2.  Click the `Generate API Token` button to create a token for the console. The API token is displayed in the `API Token for this Console` field.

![*Generating an API token.*](images/ark_admin_tab_generate_token.png)

Fig. 8.9: Generating an API token.

3.  Use the `Add Console` dialog on each console within the federation to register the other consoles with which they will be federated.

![*Registering a console.*](images/ark_admin_tab_register_console.png)

Fig. 8.10: Registering a console.

After registering each with all of the other consoles within the federation, you will be allowed to create resources in any region in which the federated consoles reside.

**Revoking a Token**

Select the `Revoke API Token` button to revoke the token assigned to the console.

![*Confirm you wish to revoke the token.*](images/ark_admin_tab_token_revoke.png)

Fig. 8.11: Confirm you wish to revoke the token.

If the console is a member of a federation, the other members of the federation will no longer be able to create resources in the area in which the console resides. To restore membership in a federation, you must generate a new token for the console and edit the console definitions of the other federation members, updating the token associated with the console.

After creating a federation, you can:

-   Log in to any federated console and initiate a cluster backup.
-   Log in to any federated console and delete a cluster.
-   Initiate a clone operation regardless of the region in which the node resides.
-   Log in to any federated console and initiate a yum update on a cluster.
-   Scale a federated cluster in multiple regions.
-   Perform machine scaling on a cluster that resides on a federated console.

<div id="manage_server_images" class="registered_link"></div>

## Managing Server Images

A server definition describes the virtual machine that will host an instance of Advanced Server or PostgreSQL. Use the `Server Type Administration` panel to manage server images.

![*The Server Type Administration section of the Admin tab*](images/ark_admin_tab_manage_server_pane.png)

Fig. 8.12: The Server Type Administration section of the Admin tab

**Creating a Server Image**

To create a new server image, connect to the Ark console as a user with administrative privileges, navigate to the Admin tab, and select `Add Server`. The `Add Server` dialog opens.

![*The Add Server dialog*](images/ark_admin_tab_create_server.png)

Fig. 8.13: The Add Server dialog

Use the fields on the `Add Server` dialog to define a new server:

-   Use the `Server ID` field to provide an identifier for the server image. The `Server ID` must be unique, and may not be modified after saving the server image.
-   Use the `Server Description` field to provide a description of the server image.
-   Use the `Image ID` field to provide the Image ID of the server image.

**On Amazon**

If you are using Ark with Amazon, provide the `AMI ID` in the `Image ID` field. Please note: you should use a server from a trusted source, with a virtualization type of hvm. We recommend using the official Amazon images from the Amazon AWS Marketplace.

**On Azure**

If you are using an Ark with Azure, you can use the Azure CLI interface to retrieve a list of the machine images that are available in the Azure Marketplace. Review the Azure documentation for information about [downloading and installing the Azure CLI](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). After installing the Azure CLI, you can use one of the following commands to retrieve a list of the available images for a specific platform and version:

| Version   | Command                                                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| RHEL 7:   | az vm image list --offer RHEL --sku 7. --output table --all   |
| CentOS 7: | az vm image list --offer CentOS --sku 7. --output table --all |

Select an image from a trusted publisher; when configuring the Ark console, provide the first three elements of the Urn column in the `Server Image ID` field. For example, if the Urn returned by the CLI is `RedHat:RHEL:7.2:7.2.20160921 7.2.20160921`, the Image ID is `RedHat:RHEL:7.2`.

Some recommended images and providers are:

-   RedHat:RHEL:7-RAW
-   OpenLogic:CentOS:7.5

Use the `Initial User` field to provide the name of the default operating system user. This user must have `sudo root` privileges to perform the initial provisioning of software on the node.

If you are using an Amazon AWS Marketplace image, the default user name is associated with the backing image; for more information about image user identities, review [the AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html).

-   Use the `System Type` field drop-down listbox to select the operating system type of the server; select CentOS or RHEL.
-   Check the box next to `Statically Provisioned` to indicate that the server is statically provisioned. A statically provisioned server is a pre-installed image that contains the software required to create a database cluster.

For detailed information about creating a statically provisioned image, please see Section 11.

When you have completed the dialog, click Save to create the server image, or Cancel to exit without saving.

**Modifying a Server**

Click the `Edit Server Details` button to open the `Edit Server Details` dialog and modify the properties of a server.

![*The Edit Server dialog*](images/ark_admin_tab_modify_server.png)

Fig. 8.14: The Edit Server dialog

After modifying the server definition, click `Save` to make the changes persistent and exit the dialog, or `Cancel` to exit without saving.

**Deleting a Server**

To delete a server definition, highlight a server name, and select the `Delete Server` button. If no engines are dependent on the server, a dialog will open, asking you to confirm that you wish to delete the selected server type.

![*The Delete Server Type dialog*](images/ark_admin_tab_delete_server.png)

Fig. 8.15: The Delete Server Type dialog

Select the `Delete` key to remove the server, or `Cancel` to exit without removing the server.

![*You cannot remove a server with dependencies*](images/ark_admin_tab_delete_server_error.png)

Fig. 8.16: You cannot remove a server with dependencies

Please note: If the server is currently used by an engine, the Ark console will advise you that the server cannot be removed; before removing the server, you must delete any dependent engines.

<div id="manage_db_engines" class="registered_link"></div>

## Managing Database Engines

An engine definition pairs a Postgres server type with the server image on which it will reside. Only an EDB Ark administrative user can define an engine. Once defined, all of the engines that reside within a specific role or group will be made available to all users with access to that group. You can use the `DB Engine Administration` section of the Admin tab to create and manage database engines.

![*The DB Engine Administration section of the Admin tab*](images/ark_admin_tab_manage_db_engine_pane.png)

Fig. 8.17: The DB Engine Administration section of the Admin tab

**Please note:** The EnterpriseDB repository structure has changed; after upgrading your Ark console to v3.5, you will have a combination of old and new DB engine configurations in the Ark Admin panel. You should migrate to the new DB engines for all new clusters since these contain the proper EDB YUM repository configuration.

The Ark console ships with a number of default engine definitions. Before using an engine, you must create a server (see [Managing Server Images](#managing-server-images)) and edit the engine details, associating a server with the engine you wish to use and enabling the engine.

The following engines are shipped with Ark. Engine definitions may include multiple repositories to provide access to all of the packages required to complete the installation. Advanced Server repositories require you to provide a USERNAME and associated PASSWORD; for credentials, visit the [EnterpriseDB website](https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf).

<div id="manage_engine_definition" class="registered_link"></div>

## Adding, Modifying, or Deleting Engine Definitions

Use the `Add Engine` dialog to define an engine. To access the `Add Engine` dialog, connect to the Ark console as a user with administrative privileges, navigate to the `Admin` tab, and select `Add Engine`.

![*The Add Engine dialog*](images/ark_admin_tab_add_db_engine.png)

Fig. 8.18: The Add Engine dialog

Use the fields on the `Add Engine` dialog to define a new server image/database pairing; please note that some fields are disabled if the server is statically provisioned:

-   Use the `ID` field to provide an identifier for the engine. Please note that the identifier must be unique, and may not be modified after saving the engine.

-   Use the drop-down listbox in the `DB Type` field to select the type of database used in the pairing.

-   Use the drop-down listbox in the `Version` field to specify the server version.

-   Use the `Name` field to provide a name for the pairing. When the engine is enabled, the specified name will be included for use on the `Create Cluster` dialog.

-   Use the drop-down listbox in the `Server Type` field to specify the server image on which the database will reside. The drop-down listbox displays those images previously defined on the Add Server dialog.

-   Use the drop-down listbox in the `RHEL Subscription` field to select the Red Hat Subscription Manager service that will be used by the engine. To populate the RHEL Subscription drop-down, describe your subscription services in the RHEL Subscription Management section of the Admin tab. RHEL Subscription Manager services are only applicable for RHEL 7 clusters.

    Please note that you must delete any instances that use an engine that is associated with a RHEL subscription before you can delete the RHEL subscription.

-   Use the `Yum repo URL` field to provide the URL of the yum repository that will be used to initially provision database packages and to later update the database packages during cluster upgrade operations. When specifying multiple repositories in the Yum repo URL field, specify one repository per line. When you perform an update, any available updates in all of the specified repositories will be applied. The repository URL should take the form:

    `http://<user_name>:<password>@<repository_url>`

    Where:

    `user_name` specifies the name of a user with sufficient privileges to access the repository.

    `password` specifies the password associated with the repository user. Please note that if your password contains special characters (such as a $), you may need to percent-encode the characters.

    `repository_url` specifies the URL of the repository.

    Please contact your EnterpriseDB account manager if you need connection credentials for the EnterpriseDB repositories, or visit [the EnterpriseDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/advanced-downloads).

-   Use the `Required DB Packages` field to provide a space-delimited list of packages that have been tested by EDB as the required minimum set to build a functional cluster instance.

When defining a database engine, you must specify the required package list for the installation in the Required DB packages field on the `Edit Engine Details` dialog.

-   Use the `Optional Node Packages` field to provide the names of any packages that should be installed (from the specified repository) on every cluster node during provisioning.

Please note: packages added via the `Optional Node Packages` field on the master node of the cluster will also be provisioned on any standby nodes that are subsequently created. If the package requires manual configuration steps, you will be required to repeat those steps on each node of the cluster; package configurations will not be propagated to standby nodes. If you add a node through cluster operations (such as failover, scaling, or restoring a node from backup), any packages on the new node will require manual configuration.

When you have completed the dialog, click `Save` to create the engine definition, or `Cancel` to exit without saving.

For information about using the EnterpriseDB repository, and the Advanced Server packages available, please see the [EDB Postgres Advanced Server Installation Guide](http://www.enterprisedb.com/products-services-training/products/documentation/enterpriseedition).

**Modifying an Engine**

To modify an engine, use the `Edit Engine Details` button to open the `Edit Engine Details` dialog.

![*The Edit Engine Details dialog*](images/ark_admin_tab_modify_db_engine.png)

Fig. 8.19: The Edit Engine Details dialog

Use fields on the Edit Engine dialog to specify property changes to an engine. When you’re finished, click the `Save` button to make the changes persistent and exit, or `Cancel` to exit without saving.

**Disabling an Engine**

You can use the disabled box to specify that an engine is (or is not) available for use in new clusters without removing the engine definition:

-   If the box next to disabled is checked, the engine will not be available for use.
-   If the box next to disabled is unchecked, the engine will be available for use.

Click the `Save` button to make any changes to the `Edit Engine Details` dialog persistent, or select `Cancel` to exit without modifying the engine definition.

Please note that disabling an engine has no impact on any running clusters; it simple prevents users from creating new clusters with the engine. You can use this feature to phase out the use of older engines.

**Deleting an Engine**

To delete an engine, highlight an engine name in the `DB Engine Administration` list, and select the `Delete Engine` button. A dialog will open, asking you to confirm that you wish to delete the selected engine.

![*The Delete DB Engine dialog*](images/ark_admin_tab_delete_db_engine.png)

Fig. 8.20: The Delete DB Engine dialog

Click the `Delete` button to remove the engine definition, or select `Cancel` to exit without removing the engine definition.

Please note that you cannot remove an engine that is referenced by one or more clusters and/or backups; if you attempt to remove an engine that is in use, EDB Ark will display a warning message.

<div id="add_supporting_component_db_engine" class="registered_link"></div>

## Adding Supporting Components to a Database Engine Definition

When you create a cluster, you specify the engine that EDB Ark will use when provisioning that cluster. If you modify the engine description, adding the list of RPM packages that will be installed when that engine is provisioned, each node of any cluster provisioned with that engine will include the functionality of the supporting component.

**Adding PostGIS to a Database Engine**

To simplify PostGIS installation, add a list of the required RPM packages to the `Optional Node Packages` field of the `Edit Engine Details` dialog. To provision replicas that contain the PostGIS functions, perform the installation and create the extensions on the master node of the cluster before adding replica nodes to your cluster.

To modify an engine description, use Administrative credentials to connect to the Ark console, and navigate to the `Admin` tab. Select an engine ID from the list of engines in the `DB Engine Administration` list, and click `Edit Engine Details`.

![*Modifying the Engine Details dialog*](images/ark_admin_tab_add_postgis_db_engine.png)

Fig. 8.21: Modifying the Engine Details dialog

When the `Edit Engine Details` dialog opens, use the fields on the dialog to specify the repository information and the names of optional RPM packages that the installer should provision on each node of the cluster.

-   The PostGIS RPM packages are distributed from the `enterprisedb tools` repository; by default, the `enterprisedb tools` repository is included in the `Yum Repo URL` field.
-   Add the names of the PostGIS RPM packages to the `Optional Node Packages` field on the `Edit Engine Details` dialog.

The PostGIS installation packages for Advanced Server 9.4 are:

`ppas94-postgis`

`ppas94-postgis-core`

`ppas94-postgis-docs`

`ppas94-postgis-utils`

The PostGIS installation packages for Advanced Server 9.5 are:

`ppas95-postgis`

`ppas95-postgis-core`

`ppas95-postgis-docs`

`ppas95-postgis-utils`

The PostGIS installation packages for Advanced Server 9.6 are:

`edb-as-96-postgis`

`edb-as-96-postgis-core`

`edb-as-96-postgis-docs`

`edb-as-96-postgis-utils`

The PostGIS installation packages for Advanced Server 10 are:

`edb-as-10-postgis`

`edb-as-10-postgis-core`

`edb-as-10-postgis-docs`

`edb-as-10-postgis-utils`

The PostGIS installation packages for Advanced Server 11 are:

`edb-as-11-postgis`

`edb-as-11-postgis-core`

`edb-as-11-postgis-docs`

`edb-as-11-postgis-jdbc`

`edb-as-11-postgis-utils`

Any EDB Ark clusters that are subsequently provisioned with that engine will automatically include an installation of the PostGIS on all nodes of the cluster.

**Creating the PostGIS Extensions**

After adding the packages to the master node of a cluster, you can use the psql client or the EDB Postgres Enterprise Manager (PEM) client to create the extensions. Before connecting with a client, an Administrator must open the listener port (by default, `5444` on an Advanced Server instance) of the node for connections.

Use a client to connect to the database in which you wish to create the extensions, and enter the following commands:

```text
CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
CREATE EXTENSION fuzzystrmatch;
CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;
CREATE EXTENSION postgis_tiger_geocoder;
```

The client will confirm that the extensions have been created successfully. The PostGIS functions are created in the public schema of the database.

Visit the PostGIS project site for detailed information about using [PostGIS](http://postgis.net/documentation/).

<div id="template_administration" class="registered_link"></div>

## Template Administration

A template contains a predefined set of server options that determine the configuration of a database cluster. A template can simplify creation of clusters that use a common configuration, or limit user access to costly resources such as large server classes. Use functionality offered in the `Template Administration` panel to create and manage templates.

![*The Template Administration section of the Admin dashboard*](images/ark_admin_tab_template_pane.png)

Fig. 8.22: The Template Administration section of the Admin dashboard

Use the `TEMPLATES ONLY` column of the `User Administration` table to specify that a user must use a template. A `Template Only` user will have access to only those templates that specify a role or tenant in which they have membership in the `Select Roles` section of the `Add Template` dialog.

If a user is specified as a `Template Only` user:

-   They must use a template when deploying a cluster.
-   They will be restricted to the scaling policies defined in the template.
-   They cannot modify a manually-defined cluster created by another user.
-   They can only create clusters in a server class that exists in an available template.
-   They must use a template when cloning or restoring from backup.
-   They may only delete backups of template created clusters.
-   They may not delete last backup of a template created cluster if the cluster had been deleted (removing the last artifact of any cluster).

To create a template, click the `Add Template` button; the `Add Template` dialog opens.

![*The Template Administration section of the Admin dashboard*](images/ark_admin_tab_add_template.png)

Fig. 8.23: The Template Administration section of the Admin dashboard

Use fields on the `Add Template` dialog to define a new template:

-   Provide a user-friendly name for the template in the `Template Name` field.
-   Use the `Description` field to provide a description of the template.
-   Use the drop-down listbox in the `Engine Version` field to select the version of the Postgres engine that you wish to use on clusters configured by the template.
-   Use the drop-down listbox in the `Server Class` field to specify the size of each cluster node. The server class determines the size and type (compute power and RAM) of any cluster configured by the template.
-   If your cluster resides on an Amazon AMI, use the drop-down listbox in the `VPC` field to specify the identity of the network in which clusters configured by the template should reside.
-   Use the drop-down listbox in the `Number of nodes` field to specify the number of nodes that should be created in each cluster.
-   Use the `Storage GB` field to specify the initial size of the data space (in Gigabytes).
-   Check the box next to `Encrypted` to indicate that the cluster should be encrypted. EDB Ark uses the aes-xts-plain (512-bit) cipher suite to provide an encryption environment that is both secure and transparent to connecting clients. When encryption is enabled, everything residing on the cluster is encrypted except for the root filesystem.
-   If the cluster will reside on an AWS host, check the box next to `EBS Optimized` to specify that the cluster should use an Amazon EBS-optimized instance and provisioned IOPS to guarantee a level of I/O performance.
-   The `IOPS` field is enabled for those clusters that will reside on an EBS-optimized instance. If applicable, specify the level of I/O performance that will be maintained for the cluster by automatic scaling. The maximum value is 30 times the size of your cluster; for example, if you have a 4 Gigabyte cluster, you can specify a maximum value of 120.
-   Check the box next to `Perform OS and Software` update to specify that a software update should be performed whenever the cluster is provisioned. Please note: this option is disabled if the cluster uses a statically provisioned server.
-   Use the `Number of backups` field to specify the number of backups that will be retained for the cluster. When the specified number of server backups is reached, EDB Ark will delete the oldest backup to make room for a new backup.
-   Use the `Backup Window` field to specify a time that it is convenient to perform a cluster backup.
-   Check the box next to `Continuous Archiving (Point-in-Time Recovery)` to enable point-in-time recovery for the cluster. When enabled, a base backup is automatically performed that can to be used to restore to a specific point in time. All subsequent automatic scheduled backups will also support point-in-time recovery.
-   Check the boxes next to the options in the `Select Scaling Options` box to indicate which options will be available to template users. Check the box next to:
    -   `Manually Scale Replicas` to specify that users of this template will be allowed to manually scale replica nodes configured by this template.
    -   `Manually Scale Storage` to specify that users of this template will be allowed to manually scale storage on clusters configured by this template.
    -   `Auto Scale Replicas` to specify that users of this template will be able to configure automatic node scaling for clusters configured by this template.
    -   `Auto Scale Storage` to specify that users of this template will be able to configure automatic storage scaling for clusters configured by this template.
-   Check the box to the left of a role name in the `Select Roles` box to indicate that members of the selected role can use the template.

When you've completed the `Add Template` dialog, click `Save` to create the defined template; click `Cancel` to close the dialog and exit without saving your work.

If you select `Launch From Template` on the `Create a New Server Cluster` dialog, you will be prompted to select the template you wish to use from the `Template Name` drop-down listbox. After selecting a template, you can use the `Full Template Details` link to open a popup that displays detailed information about the configuration of clusters deployed with the template.

<div id="rhel_subscription" class="registered_link"></div>

## Red Hat Subscription Management

You can use the Ark Administrative console to attach Red Hat Subscription Manager information to engines hosted on Red Hat consoles. The Red Hat Subscription Manager tracks installed products and subscriptions to implement content management with tools like yum. Visit the Red Hat website for information about [Red Hat Subscription Manager](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-subscription-management/).

When you create a new cluster that uses an engine that is associated with a Red Hat subscription, Ark registers the cluster nodes with Red Hat; when you terminate the node, the system's subcription is unregistered.

Use the `RHEL Subscription Management` section of the Admin tab to define and manage Red Hat Subscription Manager access for your Ark consoles that reside on Red Hat Linux instances.

![*The RHEL Subscription Management section.*](images/ark_admin_tab_rhel_sub_mgmt_pane.png)

-   The `LOGINS` column displays a cumulative total of the number of times that the user has logged in.

After adding the user to the Ark console, use the psql client application to add the user to the backing `postgres` database. To use the psql client, SSH to the host of the Ark console. Then, navigate into the `bin` directory, and connect to the psql client with the command:

`./psql –d postgres –U postgres`

When prompted, supply the password of the postgres database user. After connecting to the database, you can use the `CREATE ROLE` command to add a user to the database:

`ADD USER user_name WITH PASSWORD 'password';`

Where:

`user_name` specifies the name of the Ark user.

`password` specifies the password associated with the user name.

Please note: The user name and associated password specified in the Ark backing database must match the credentials specified when registering the user in the Ark console.

For detailed information about using the psql client please see the [Postgres core documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/en/10/pg/app-psql.html).

After the administrative user adds the end-user, the end-user will complete the registration process by navigating to the URL of the console, and logging in.

Use the buttons below the AWS user table to manage user accounts for the AWS console and user-owned objects.
