The following features have been added to the EDB Ark user console for this release.



  - Ark now supports EDB Postgres Advanced Server and PostgreSQL version 12 database clusters.
  - EnterpriseDB has introduced a new RPM repository structure that combines the contents of the previous three repositories into a single repository. The new structure is supported by Ark. For information about connecting to the repository, visit <https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf>.
  - Ark now provides extended support for multi-region features (including manual promotion and API support).
  - You can use the `Promote` option (located on a cluster's context menu in the `Details` panel) to replace the master node with a standby node. For more information, see the EDB Postgres Ark Getting Started Guide.
  - The `/templates` and `/templates/id` resources now support the `region` property.
  - Support for Amazon `r4.*` and `r5.8x` instance types has been reinstated.

## Limitations

**Cloning, Recovering, or Scaling Encrypted Clusters from Previous Versions**

Encrypted clusters created with Ark 3.3 or prior may not be used to clone, recover, or scale to a machine type that is not supported by that earlier version. If you will be moving encrypted clusters created with Ark version 3.3 or prior to a new machine type (as supported by Ark 3.4 or 3.5), you will need to:

1.  Clone the encrypted cluster to a new, unencrypted cluster.
2.  Upgrade the Ark console on which the cluster resides.
3.  Clone the unencrypted cluster to a new encrypted cluster of the new machine type.

For detailed information about cloning a cluster, see the *EDB Postgres Ark Getting Started Guide*.

**Cloning with a Template from a Foreign Region**

You cannot use a template when cloning from a foreign region.

**Monitoring a Federated Console with PEM**

Ark does not support federated consoles configured in local PEM server mode.

**Federating Consoles that host clusters with the Same Name**

If you are upgrading to version 3.4 or 3.5, and plan to federate existing Ark version 3.3 consoles that host clusters with the same name, you must first create a clone of one of the clusters specifying an alternate name; federated consoles cannot be used to host clusters with the same name. For example, if you plan to federate two consoles that both contain a cluster named `acctg`, you should clone one of the clusters specifying an alternate name for the cluster (i.e. `acctg-west`). Then, you can federate the consoles; both consoles will have access to `acctg` and `acctg-west`.
