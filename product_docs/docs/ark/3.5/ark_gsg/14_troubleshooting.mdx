## Frequently Asked Questions

**Problem: Logging into the Console sometimes takes a long time.**

This can be attributed to delays in the connection time to the cloud provider. When you log in, the Console Manager must pass your credentials to the provider to log in; any delays at the service provider may slow your connection time.

**Problem: I am attempting to connect to my cluster, but don't know my default database name.**

-   The name of the default database in an Advanced Server cluster is `edb`.
-   The name of the default database in a PostgreSQL cluster is `postgres`.

**Problem: unable to connect to the load balancing port (9999).**

If you are having difficulty connecting to the load balancing port, you should:

-   Make sure you are connecting to the master server's DNS name, rather than a replica's DNS name; the load balancer resides on the master node of an EDB Ark cluster.
-   Make sure that your client application is providing an MD-5 encrypted password when attempting to connect to the load balancing port. The username:password-md5 combination is stored in `pgpool_passwd.conf`, and is automatically updated when a user changes password, or when a new user is created.

**Problem: pgpool keeps issuing the following error: make_persistent_db_connection: s_do_auth failed.**

pgpool attempts to connect to each node to perform replication lag checking. This happens unconditionally if pgpool is configured in a master-slave mode and streaming replication is being used (which is the case for EDB Ark). The pgpool community has been alerted to this behavior; please ignore these messages.

**Question: How do I stop the Postgres server on a cluster node without triggering a failover process?**

To safely stop a Postgres server without triggering failover, you can use either the `service` command or the pg_ctl utility. For more information, see [Controlling the Database Server](13_database_management/#controlling_server) .

**Problem: I am attempting to connect to my Advanced Server database with the psql client, and am getting an error**

```text
(03/23/2012 13:36:53)-> psql --host=192.0.43.10 -p 9999 -U enterprisedb
Password for user enterprisedb: psql: FATAL: database "postgres" does
not exist
```

The psql client expects the default database to be named `postgres`; the edb-psql client expects the default database to be named `edb`. If you attempt to connect to an Advanced Server cluster with the psql client without specifying the name of the database to which it should connect, the client will fail to connect.

You can include the `-d` or `--dbname` flag, followed by the database name when invoking either client to specify the database to which the client should connect.

**Question: I'm trying to drop a database from a cluster, but I am getting an error that there are open sessions. There are no clients connected. How can I terminate any leftover backend sessions?**

It may be that pgpool is retaining a connection to the database. You can use the `pg_cancel_backend()` or `pg_terminate_backend()` functions to selectively close connections to the database you wish to drop.

**Question: Why do I have to restart pgPool before it will recognize new users that I've added to the database server?**

pgPool does not check for new Postgres users. EDB Ark has a periodic update process that updates the user list every 20 seconds; if the update process identifies a new user, it sends a reload signal to the pgPool process. After the reload, pgPool will allow new users to login.

Instead of reloading, simply waiting for 20 seconds between the CREATE USER statement and the CREATEDB statement should solve the problem.

**Question: Why are scheduled backups not working?**

If you invoke the `pg_start_backup()` function before performing a manual backup your database, you must remember to invoke the `pg_stop_backup()` function when the backup has completed, or EDB Ark scheduled backups will fail.

## The EDB Ark Email Notification System

EDB Ark invokes an email notification system that will alert you if your cluster changes or encounters a problem. Email notifications are sent to the address used to log in to the management console.

EDB Ark will send an email:

-   When a new cluster is created.
-   If a server stops (or is terminated).
-   When a replica is added to a cluster.
-   When memory is scaled up.
-   When failover is invoked on a master or a replica.
-   If a backup fails.
-   If the password associated with your user account changes.

The `Notification Email` field (on the `User` tab) allows you to change the notification email associated with your user account; for more information, see [The User Tab](04_using_ark_console/04_ark_user_tab/#ark_user_tab) .
