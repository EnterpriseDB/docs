**EDB Postgres Ark**

EDB Ark automatically provisions PostgreSQL or EDB Postgres Advanced Server databases in single instances, high-availability clusters, or application development sandboxes. EDB Ark frees DBAs and application developers from the rigors of setting up and administering robust database environments. In minutes, EDB Ark configures a cluster of database machines with:

  - Streaming replication
  - Connection pooling
  - Load balancing
  - Automatic failover (transaction or recovery time preferred)
  - Secure data encryption
  - Rotating user-scheduled backups
  - Point-in-time recovery
  - Elastic storage
  - Elastic scale out

EDB Ark's automatic scaling of storage resources and scale out of read replicas when a database cluster reaches user-defined thresholds provides unattended, around-the-clock responsiveness to unpredictable load demands on your database infrastructure.

This document will demonstrate how to use the EDB Ark console successfully in your cloud-based database management activities.
