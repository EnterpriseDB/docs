EDB Ark creates fully-functioning, high-availability database clusters of various sizes complete with replication, load balancing, connection pooling, backup and failover capabilities. An EDB Ark cluster can be defined in minutes without any special database knowledge or skills. This characteristic is greatly appreciated by application developers who want to create robust, data-intensive applications quickly, and who may not have the time, inclination, or skills to otherwise achieve the same results. This type of black box setup was designed to dramatically increase the productivity of developers, DBAs, and system administrators alike.

However, there are many users who, while enjoying the black box benefits described above, prefer to take a more hands-on approach to managing their databases. EDB Ark was also designed with these users in mind.

You can also use supporting components to extend the functionality of your EDB Ark cluster; the following sections provide an overview of how to add an extension to a new or existing cluster.

!!! Note
    The EDB Ark Administrator’s console provides an easy way to install and maintain the latest server-related packages. Talk to your system administrator about automatically including supporting components for your cluster when provisioning the database engine.

## Adding an Extension to a New Cluster

Supporting components and utilities can extend the functionality of your Postgres cluster. For example, you may want to consider adding EDB Postgres Enterprise Manager for management, monitoring, and statistical analysis functionality, or PostGIS, to provide support for spatial data types and functions.

An administrative user can use the `Optional Node Packages` field on the `Add Engine` or `Edit Engine` dialog to modify a database engine definition, providing the names of optional rpm packages that will be installed (from the specified repository) during provisioning. All engines created with that definition will contain the new component; the component will be provisioned on each replica as well as on the master node. As each rpm is installed, yum will satisfy the dependencies for the new component.

Packages added via the `Optional Node Packages` field on the master node of the cluster will be provisioned on any standby nodes that are subsequently created. If the package requires manual configuration steps, you will be required to repeat those steps on each node of the cluster; package configurations will not be propagated to standby nodes. If you add a node through cluster operations (such as failover, scaling, or restoring a node from backup), any packages on the new node will also require manual configuration.

For information about modifying a database engine to add a supporting component, see the *EDB Ark Administrative User's Guide*.
