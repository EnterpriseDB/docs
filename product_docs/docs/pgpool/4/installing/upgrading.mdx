You can perform an EDB Pgpool-II minor version upgrade, for example, to upgrade from 4.2.5 to 4.2.6. 

For information about upgrading extensions, see [Upgrading EDB Pgpool-II extensions](../installing_extensions/upgrading_extensions).

!!! Note 
    Version 4.3 is a major release. For more details on migrating from a version earlier than 4.3, see [Migration](https://www.pgpool.net/docs/43/en/html/release-4-3-0.html#MIGRATION-4-3-0).

To upgrade:

```shell
sudo <package-manager> upgrade edb-pgpool<xx>
```

Where:

-  `<package-manager>` is the package manager used with your operating system.

   | Package manager |         Operating system         |
   | --------------- | -------------------------------- |
   | dnf             | RHEL 8/9 and derivatives         |
   | yum             | RHEL 7 and derivatives, CentOS 7 |
   | zypper          | SLES                             |
   | apt-get         | Debian and Ubuntu                |
 
- `<xx>` is the EDB Pgpool-II version you want to upgrade. 

For example, to upgrade from EDB Pgpool-II 4.2.5 to 4.2.6 on RHEL 9:

```shell
sudo dnf upgrade edb-pgpool42
```
