## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install Postgres on the same host. See:

  - [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/installing/)

  - [Installing PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.
  To determine if your repository exists, enter this command: `dnf repolist | grep enterprisedb`

  To set up the EDB repository:

  1. Go [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads).
  1. Select the button that provides access to the EDB repo. Depending on your subscription level, you may be able to access two generations of EDB repos. EDB Repos 2.0 provides the most recent instructions.
  1. Select the platform and software that you want to download.

- Install the EPEL repository
  ```shell
  sudo dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
  ```
- Refresh the cache
  ```shell
  sudo dnf makecache
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-pgpool<xx>
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB PgPool-II you are installing. For example, if you are installing version 4.3, the package name would be `edb-pgpool43`.
