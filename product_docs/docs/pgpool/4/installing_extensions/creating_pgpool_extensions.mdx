You must install and create the extensions in each database where you plan to use EDB Pgpool-II. To ensure all extensions are available for future databases, you can add the extension to the `template1` database. Any extensions installed in the `template1` database are created in each of the databases that uses `template1` as a template during creation.

`Pgpool_adm` is a set of extensions that allows SQL access to PCP commands. For information, see  [PCP commands](https://www.pgpool.net/docs/latest/en/html/pcp-commands.html).
   
After installing the `Pgpool_adm` extension, use the psql client application to connect to the database, and execute the following SQL command:

```sql
CREATE EXTENSION pgpool_adm;
```

The `Pgpool_recovery` extension is required for online recovery and future fail-back mechanisms.
