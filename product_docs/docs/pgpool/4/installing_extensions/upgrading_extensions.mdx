The following sections outline the minor version upgrade process for EDB Pgpool-II extensions (for example, upgrading from 4.2.5 to 4.2.6). 

!!! Note 
    4.3 is a major release. For more details on migrating from earlier versions to version 4.3, see the [Migration Section](https://www.pgpool.net/docs/43/en/html/release-4-3-0.html#MIGRATION-4-3-0).

When upgrading, assume the identity of the root user and invoke the following command:

On RHEL/CentOS 7:

```shell
yum upgrade edb-pgpool<xx>
```

where &lt;xx> is the EDB Pgpool-II version you want to upgrade. For example, to upgrade from EDB Pgpool-II 4.2.5 to 4.2.6, execute the following command:

```shell
yum upgrade edb-pgpool42
```

On RHEL/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux 8:

```shell
dnf upgrade edb-pgpool<xx>
```

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```shell
apt-get upgrade edb-pgpool<xx>
```

On SLES 12:

```shell
zypper upgrade edb-pgpool<xx>
```
