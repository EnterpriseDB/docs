EDB Pgpool-II is an enhanced version of the community Pgpool product, intended to support additional EDB Postgres Advanced Server capabilities. You can use it with PostgreSQL and EDB Postgres Advanced Server. EDB Pgpool-II acts as middleware between client applications and a Postgres database server. 

Using EDB Pgpool-II adds the following benefits to your application connection infrastructure:

-   Transparently reroutes and ensures load balancing of read-only transactions to standby database servers
-   Reuses connections to prevent reconnects
-   Brings down Postgres connections by queuing stale connections
-   Integrates with failover managers to follow the primary

EDB supports the following Pgpool-II functionality:

-   Load balancing
-   Connection pooling
-   Replication
-   High availability
-   Connection limits
-   Watchdog
-   Limiting exceeding connections
-   In-memory query cache

EDB Pgpool-II also provides extensions to EDB Postgres Advanced Server functionality. These extensions are packaged as modules in an extensions directory, and they provide additional features for EDB Postgres Advanced Server. These modules are generally not included in the core database. After they are loaded in a database, the extensions can function like built-in features. They allow you to use simple `SELECT` commands to use PCP remotely.

!!! Note
    EDB Pgpool-II extensions are delivered only for supported combinations of EDB Postgres Advanced Server versions and operating systems.
