New features, enhancements, bug fixes, and other changes in Pgpool-II 4.2.5 include the following:

| Type | Description |
| ---- |------------ |
| Bug Fix | Fixed maximum length of hostnames, including domain name. Now the correct value is 256 instead of 128.|
| Bug Fix | Fixed query cache so that it does not cache SQLValueFunctions.|
| Bug Fix | Implemented follow_primary command-locking over the watchdog channel. This is a supplementary fix for a race condition between detach_false_primary and follow_primary_command.|
| Bug Fix | Fixed the issue wherein the client-side hangs when a NoData response follows a Describe statement.|
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue that sent an incorrect length error query (to abort transactions running on the non-main nodes), throwing an “invalid string in message” error at the backend in SI mode.|
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue wherein child processes created by follow_primary command were orphaned when pgpool was shut down.|
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue wherein, after executing the follow_primary command, the status of a standby node was set as down using the pcp_detach_node.|
| Bug Fix | Fixed the watchdog communication race condition wherein the watchdog notified the new message to the main process, which took significant time to process the message.|
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue wherein the watchdog node status was not updating after rebooting one of the cluster nodes.| 
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue wherein the follow_primary_command failed when watchdog was enabled.|
| Bug Fix | Fixed a bug related to PGPOOL SHOW heartbeat and PGPOOL SHOW ALL commands where the last entry of command result was not shown.|
| Bug Fix | Fixed an issue to allow the value of the parameter [log_rotation_age](https://www.pgpool.net/docs/42/en/html/runtime-config-logging.html#GUC-LOG-ROTATION-AGE) to be set to 0 to disable it.|
| Bug Fix | Fixed an incorrect display of the load balancing node status in raw clustering mode.|
| Bug Fix | Fixed the pgpool logger process, which was utilizing 100% CPU.|
| Bug Fix | Fixed the  SI mode to acquire a snapshot with an internal transaction.|
| Bug Fix | Fixed the backend_flag* parameter, which was shown twice while executing the PGPOOL SHOW ALL command.|
| Bug Fix | Updated the other_pgpool parameter (removed in the 4.2 release) to watchdog in the SHOW ALL command.|
