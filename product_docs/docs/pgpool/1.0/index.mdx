Pgpool-II acts as a middleware between client applications and a PostgreSQL database server.

Using Pgpool-II adds the following benefits to your application connection infrastructure:

-   Transparently reroutes and ensures load balancing of Read Only transactions to Standby database servers
-   Reuses connections to prevent reconnects
-   Brings down Postgres connections by queuing stale connections
-   Integrates with Failover managers to follow the primary

EDB supports the following Pgpool-II functionality:

-   Load balancing
-   Connection pooling
-   Replication
-   High availability
-   Connection limits
-   Watchdog
-   Limiting Exceeding Connections
-   In Memory Query Cache
