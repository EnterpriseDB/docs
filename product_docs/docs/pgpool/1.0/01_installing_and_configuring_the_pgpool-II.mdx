pgpool-II runs as a service on Linux systems. It is not supported on Windows systems.

The pgpool version required by your Advanced Server installation is version-specific, but the documented and supported functionality of each version is the same. The following table lists the pgpool version and their corresponding Advanced Server versions. The information in this guide applies to each version listed in the table below.

<div id="supported platforms table" class="registered_link"></div>

**Supported pgpool-II and Advanced Server Versions**

This guide assumes that the user has some knowledge of installation and system administration procedures, and has administrative privileges on the host.

## Installing pgpool-II on a RHEL/CentOS Host

You can install pgpool-II using the `yum` command on a RHEL/CentOS 6 and 7 host, or using the `dnf` command on a CentOS/RHEL 8 host (see [supported platforms table](#supported%20platforms%20table) for details about supported platforms).

If you have previously used an RPM package to install Advanced Server, you have probably already created the repository configuration file and have EDB credentials. If that is the case, you can install pgpool with the command:

On RHEL/CentOS 6 and 7:

    yum install edb-pgpool<xx>

On RHEL/CentOS 8:

    dnf install edb-pgpool<xx>

Where &lt;xx&gt; is the pgpool version you wish to install.

If you encounter an installation-related issue, see [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) for a workaround.

**Creating a Repository and Installing pgpool-II**

If you need to create an EDB repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges and follow the steps described below.

**Step 1**: Before installing `pgpool-II`, invoke the following command to install the `epel-release` package:

On RHEL/CentOS 6 and 7:

    yum -y install epel-release

On RHEL/CentOS 8:

    dnf -y install epel-release

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

You may need to enable the `[extras]` repository definition in the `CentOS-Base.repo` file (located in `/etc/yum.repos.d`).

</div>

Ensure you have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, [visit the EDB website](https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf).

**Step 2**: After receiving your repository credentials, create the repository configuration file using the following command:

On RHEL/CentOS 6 and 7:

    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm

On RHEL/CentOS 8:

    dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edb-repo-rpms/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm

The repository configuration file is named `edb.repo`, which resides in `/etc/yum.repos.d`.

Use your choice of editor to ensure that the `enabled` parameter value is `1`, and replace the `username` and `password` placeholders in the `baseurl` specification with the credentials of a registered EDB user.

>     [edb]
>     name=EnterpriseDB RPMs $releasever - $basearch
>     baseurl=https://<username>:<password>@yum.enterprisedb.com/edb/redhat/rhel-$releasever-$basearch
>     enabled=1
>     gpgcheck=1
>     gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/ENTERPRISEDB-GPG-KEY

**Step 3**: After creating and modifying the `edb.repo` file, execute the following commands to update the metadata:

    yum clean all

    yum makecache

**Step 4**: After saving your changes to the configuration file, use the following yum command to install `pgpool-II`:

On RHEL/CentOS 6 and 7:

>     yum install edb-pgpool<xx>

On RHEL/CentOS 8:

>     dnf install edb-pgpool<xx>

Where &lt;xx&gt; is the pgpool release version.

For example, to install `pgpool Version 4.1.2`, execute the following command:

On RHEL/CentOS 6 and 7:

>     yum install edb-pgpool41

On RHEL/CentOS 8:

>     dnf install edb-pgpool41

When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, your permission to import the key to your local server may be asked for. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

pgpool-II will be installed in the `/usr/edb/pgpool<x.x>/share` directory, where &lt;x.x&gt; is the installed pgpool-II version number. The configuration files are created in the `/etc/sysconfig/edb/pgpool<x.x>` directory, where *&lt;x.x&gt;* is the pgpool release version. By default, `.sample` is appended to the configuration file name; remove the `.sample` from the configuration file after copying the file to create your custom configuration.

**Installation Troubleshooting**

This section provides a workaround for the following installation issue:

> `existing lock /var/run/yum.pid: another copy is running as pid 3104.` `Another app is currently holding the yum lock; waiting for it to exit`

To fix this issue, execute the following command:

    rm -f /var/run/yum.pid

## Installing pgpool-II on a Debian/Ubuntu Host

To install pgpool-II on a Debian or Ubuntu host, you must have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. To request credentials for the repository, visit [the EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

The following steps walks you through using the EDB apt repository to install a DEB package. When using the commands, replace the `username` and `password` with the credentials provided by EDB.

Please note that if you are using the pdf version of this document, using cut/paste to copy command may result in extra spaces or carriage returns in the pasted command. If a command fails, check the command carefully for additional characters.

1.  Assume superuser privileges:

    >     sudo su â€“

2.  Configure the EDB repository:

    >     sh -c 'echo "deb https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/$(lsb_release -cs)-edb $(lsb_release -cs) main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/edb-$(lsb_release -cs).list'

3.  Add support to your system for secure APT repositories:

    >     apt-get install apt-transport-https

4.  Add the EDB signing key:

    >     wget -q -O - https://username:password@apt.enterprisedb.com/edb-deb.gpg.key | apt-key add -

5.  Update the repository metadata:

    >     apt-get update

6.  Install DEB package:

    >     apt-get install edb-pgpool<xx>

Where &lt;xx&gt; is the pgpool release version.

After installing pgpool-II on a Debian host, the configuration files are located in the `/etc/edb/edb-pgpool<x.x>` directory, where &lt;x.x&gt; is the pgpool release version. By default, `.sample` is appended to the configuration file name; `.sample` should be removed after copying the file to create your custom configuration.

## Installing pgpool-II Using an SLES 12 Host

You can use the zypper package manager to install pgpool-II on an SLES 12 host. zypper will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package, but requires access to specific repositories that are not hosted at EDB.

1.  Assume superuser privileges.

<!-- -->

    Sudo su -

1.  Use the following command to add the EDB repository to your SLES host:

<!-- -->

    zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

Ensure you have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, [click this link](https://info.enterprisedb.com/rs/069-ALB-339/images/Repository%20Access%2004-09-2019.pdf).

1.  Use the following command to refresh the metadata on your SLES host to include the EDB repository:

<!-- -->

    zypper refresh

1.  Then, use the zypper utility to install pgpool-II:

<!-- -->

    zypper install edb-pgpool<xx>

Where &lt;xx&gt; is the pgpool version you wish to install. Currently, 4.0.9 and 4.1.2 versions are supported on an SLES 12 host.

## pgpool-II Host Setup

After modifying the parameter settings that implement pgpool-II functionality for your installation, you must start the pgpool-II service. For detailed information about controlling the pgpool-II service, see the *Managing an Advanced Server Installation* section of the EDB Postgres Advanced Server Installation Guide for Linux available at the [EDB website](http://www.enterprisedb.com/edb-docs/p/edb-postgres-advanced-server).

When pgpool-II starts, it records its process ID in a `pgpool.conf` file whose name is determined by the `pid_file_name` configuration parameter. The initial value of the `pid_file_name` parameter in the sample file is:

> `pid_file_name = /var/run/edb/pgpool<x.x>/edb-pgpool-<x.x>.pid`

Where &lt;x.x&gt; is the pgpool release version.

Please note that the contents of the `/var/run` directory (including the `pgpool` directory) may be removed by the operating system during a reboot. The `/var/run/edb/pgpool` directory should not be used as the location for the `pgpool.pid` file. Modify the `pid_file_name` parameter to specify a safer directory location.
