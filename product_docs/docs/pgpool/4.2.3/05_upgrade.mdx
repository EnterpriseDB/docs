The following section outlines the Pgpool and Pgpool extensions upgrade process.

## Upgrading Pgpool-II

The following section outlines the Pgpool-II minor version upgrade process (for example, to upgrade from 3.7.13 to 3.7.14):

Assume the identity of the root user and invoke the following command:

On RHEL/CentOS 7:

```text
yum upgrade edb-pgpool<xx>
```

where &lt;xx> is the Pgpool version you want to upgrade. For example, to upgrade from Pgpool 3.7.13 to 3.7.14, execute the following command:

```text
yum upgrade edb-pgpool37
```

On RHEL/CentOS 8:

```text
dnf upgrade edb-pgpool<xx>
```

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```text
apt-get upgrade edb-pgpool<xx>
```

On SLES 12:

```text
zypper upgrade edb-pgpool<xx>
```

## Upgrading Pgpool-II Extensions

The following section outlines the Pgpool-II extensions upgrade process.

To upgrade from older versions of Pgpool extensions to the latest version, assume superuser privileges and execute the following command:

On RHEL/CentOS 7:

```text
yum upgrade edb-as<xx>-pgpool<yy>-extensions
```

Where `<xx>` is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version, and `<yy>` is the Pgpool extension version.

!!! Note
    Only minor version upgrade is supported (for example, you can upgrade from 3.6.20 to 3.6.21 extension, but not 3.7.14).

On RHEL/CentOS 8:

```text
dnf upgrade edb-as<xx>-pgpool<yy>-extensions
```

On Debian/Ubuntu:

```text
apt-get upgrade edb-as<xx>-pgpool<yy>-extensions
```

On SLES 12:

```text
zypper upgrade edb-as<xx>-pgpool<yy>-extensions
```
