The configuration files are created in the `/etc/sysconfig/edb/pgpool<x.y>` directory, where *&lt;x.y>* is the Pgpool release version. By default, `.sample` is appended to the configuration file name; remove the `.sample` from the configuration file after copying the file to create your custom configuration.

!!! Note
    The configuration options for Pgpool-II are extensive; consider the options listed below as a starting point only. For more information about configuring and using Pgpool-II, please consult the [project website](https://www.pgpool.net/docs/latest/en/html/index.html).

## Configuring Connection Pooling

Pgpool-II provides a set of child processes that maintain cached connections to one or more database servers. When a client connects, Pgpool-II attempts to reuse a connection from its pool, thus avoiding the overhead of opening and closing client connections.

You can reuse a connection in the pool only if the target database and the connection user match a prior connection, which is currently in the pool. The `pgpool.conf` file specifies the connection pooling configuration options (such as the number of child processes and the maximum number of cached connections per child).

To configure connection pooling with one database server:

1.  Configure the `pg_hba.conf` file on the `Pgpool-II` host to permit connections between the clients and the server.

2.  Copy the `pgpool.conf.sample` file to `pgpool.conf`, modify the file, set the `connection_cache` parameter to `on`, and specify connection properties for your database server.

    The following example shows how to connect with the EDB Postgres Advanced Server:

    ```text
    connection_cache = on

    backend_hostname0 = 'localhost'

    backend_port0 = 5444

    backend_weight0 = 1

    backend_data_directory0 = '/var/lib/edb/as13/data'
    ```

    The following example shows how to connect with the PostgreSQL Server:

    ```text
    connection_cache = on

    backend_hostname0 = 'localhost'

    backend_port0 = 5432

    backend_weight0 = 1

    backend_data_directory0 = '/var/lib/pgsql/13/data'
    ```

    !!! Note
        In the `pgpool.conf` file, connection parameters have an appended digit that specifies a cluster node identifier. Database node `0` specifies values for the primary node.

3.  Optionally, configure [Pgpool-II client authentication](#pgpool-II_client_authentication_configuration).

4.  Optionally, configure the [PCP administrative interface](#pcp_configuration).

5.  Start Pgpool-II:

    ```text
    systemctl start edb-pgpool-<x.y>.service
    ```

    where &lt;x.y> is the Pgpool release version.

6.  Execute the following platform-specific command to connect to Pgpool42:

    On  EDB Postgres Advanced Server for CentOS 7:

    ```text
    ./psql -d edb -p 9999 -U enterprisedb -h /tmp
    ```

    On  EDB Postgres Advanced Server for Debian:

    ```text
    ./psql -d edb -p 9999 -U enterprisedb
    ```

    On  PostgreSQL Server for CentOS 7:

    ```text
    ./psql -d postgres -p 9999 -U postgres -h /tmp
    ```

    On  PostgreSQL Server for Debian:

    ```text
    ./psql -d postgres -p 9999 -U postgres
    ```

<div id="configuring_pgpool-II_load_balancing" class="registered_link"></div>

## Configuring Load Balancing

EDB supports replication scenarios that use Pgpool-II load balancing with PostgreSQL streaming replication or Slony replication. The supported replication methods ensure that database updates made by client applications apply to multiple backend servers. For detailed information about the benefits of each replication method and configuration instructions, please review [project documentation](https://www.pgpool.net/docs/latest/en/html/runtime-config-running-mode.html) for each utility.

When load balancing is enabled, Pgpool-II distributes some types of `SELECT` statements to backend servers, allowing multiple database servers and hosts to share the processing load of `SELECT` statements issued by client applications.

When configuring Pgpool-II load balancing, the initial database environments in all backend servers must be identical:

-   Tables must have the same name, definition, and row content.
-   Schemas must exist in each backend application database.
-   Roles and privileges on each backend server must be configured to ensure the result set of SQL statements are identical on all servers.

If you use `password` authentication, assign the same password to an associated user name on each database server. Use the same user name/password pair to connect Pgpool-II to each backend connection.

Within a replication scenario, each backend is uniquely identified by the hostname (or IP address) and the port number on which the database server instance is listening for connections. You must ensure that the `pool_hba.conf` and `pg_hba.conf` files allow a connection between that server and the host on which Pgpool-II will be running.

The following example demonstrates how to implement Pgpool-II load balancing with two servers (the primary and replica nodes) in a Streaming Replication scenario. Configuring Pgpool-II load balancing for a Slony replication scenario is similar; please see the [Slony documentation](https://www.slony.info/adminguide/2.2/doc/adminguide/slony.pdf) for information about configuring Slony replication.

**Configuring the Primary Node of the Replication Scenario**

Open an SSH session with the primary node of the replication scenario, and modify the `pg_hba.conf` file (located in the `/var/lib/edb/as13/data` directory), adding connection information for the replication user (in the example that follows, `edbrepuser` resides on a standby node with an IP address of `107.178.217.178`):

```text
   host replication edbrepuser 107.178.217.178/32 md5
```

The connection information should specify the address of the replication scenario's standby node and your preferred authentication method.

Modify the `postgresql.conf` file (located in `/var/lib/edb/as13/data`), adding the following replication parameter and values to the end of the file:

```text
 wal_level = replica
 max_wal_senders = 10
 checkpoint_segments = 8
 wal_keep_segments = 0
```

Save the configuration file, and restart the server:

 To restart on RHEL/CentOS 7 and 8 platforms:

 ```text
 systemctl restart edb-as-13
 ```

 To restart on Debian 9.x | 10.x or Ubuntu 18.04 | 20.04 platforms:

 ```text
 /usr/edb/as13/bin/epas_ctlcluster 13 main restart
 ```

Use the `sudo su -` command to assume the identity of the `enterprisedb` database superuser:

```text
 sudo su - enterprisedb
 ```

Then, start a `psql` session, connecting to the `edb` database:

 ```text
 psql -d edb
 ```

At the `psql` command line, create a user with the `replication` attribute:

```text
 CREATE ROLE edbrepuser WITH REPLICATION LOGIN PASSWORD 'password';
 ```

**Configuring the Standby Node of the Replication Scenario**

Open an SSH session with the standby server, and assume the identity of the database superuser (`enterprisedb`):

```text
sudo su - enterprisedb
```

With your choice of editor, create a `.pgpass` file in the home directory of the `enterprisedb` user. The `.pgpass` file holds the password of the replication user in plain-text form; if you are using a `.pgpass` file, you should ensure that only trusted users have access to the `.pgpass` file:

Add an entry that specifies connection information for the replication user:

```text
*:5444:*:edbrepuser:password
```

The server will enforce restrictive permissions on the `.pgpass` file; use the following command to set the file permissions:

```text
chmod 600 .pgpass
```

Relinquish the identity of the database superuser:

```text
exit
```

Then, assume superuser privileges:

```text
sudo su -
```

Use your platform-specific command to stop the database server before replacing the data directory on the standby node with the `data` directory of the primary node.

Then, delete the `data` directory on the standby node:

```text
rm -rf /var/lib/edb/as13/data
```

After deleting the existing `data` directory, use the `pg_basebackup` utility to copy the `data` directory of the primary node to the standby:

```text
pg_basebackup --format=p --label=standby --host=146.148.46.44 --username=edbrepuser --password --wal-method=stream -R
```

The call to `pg_basebackup` specifies the IP address of the primary node and the name of the replication user created on the primary node.

Including the `-R` option creates the `standby.signal` file and appends connection settings to `postgresql.auto.conf` in the output directory (or into the base archive file when using tar format) to ease setting up a standby server.

For more information about the options available with the `pg_basebackup` utility, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/app-pgbasebackup.html).

When prompted by `pg_basebackup`, provide the password associated with the replication user.

After copying the `data` directory, change ownership of the directory to the database superuser (`enterprisedb`):

```text
chown -R enterprisedb /var/lib/edb/as13/data
```

Modify the `postgresql.conf` file (located in `/var/lib/edb/as13/data`), specifying the following values at the end of the file:

```text
wal_level = replica
hot_standby = on
```

The `data` file has been copied from the primary node, and contains the replication parameters specified previously.

Then, restart the server. At this point, the primary node will be replicating data to the standby node.

**Configuring Pgpool-II Load Balancing**

Use your choice of editor to modify the `pgpool.conf` file. Within the `pgpool.conf` file, modify the parameter settings to specify that load balancing is enabled:

```text
load_balance_mode = on
```

Then, specify the connections settings for the primary database node in the parameter set that ends with a `0`. For example:

```text
backend_hostname0 = '146.148.46.44'
backend_port0 = 5444
backend_weight0 = 1
backend_data_directory0 = '/var/lib/edb/as13/data'
```

Then, specify the connections settings for each node to which queries will be distributed. Increment the number that follows the parameter name for each node, and provide connection details:

```text
backend_hostname1 = '107.178.217.178'
backend_port1 = 5444
backend_weight1 = 1
backend_data_directory1 = '/var/lib/edb/as13/data'
```

Use the `backend_weight` parameter to specify how queries will be distributed amongst the nodes. Specify a value of `1` to indicate that you wish (qualified) queries to be equally distributed across the nodes of the replication scenario.

**Restart Pgpool-II**

```text
systemctl restart edb-pgpool-<x.y>.service
```

where &lt;x.y> is the Pgpool release version.

<div id="pgpool-II_client_authentication_configuration" class="registered_link"></div>

## Configuring Client Authentication

When Pgpool-II is enabled, client applications connect to Pgpool-II, which acts as a middleman for a Postgres server. A connecting client application is first authenticated with the Pgpool-II server and then with the Postgres server.

Parameter settings in the `pool_hba.conf` configuration file determine the Pgpool-II authentication properties. The `pool_hba.conf` file is similar in format and function to the Postgres `pg_hba.conf` configuration file. Please refer to the [Pgpool-II documentation](https://www.pgpool.net/docs/latest/en/html/auth-pool-hba-conf.html) for detailed information about `pool_hba.conf` entries.

To enable Pgpool-II authentication:

1.  Copy the `pool_hba.conf.sample` file to `pool_hba.conf`.
2.  Modify the `pool_hba.conf` file, specifying authentication information for servers or users you want to connect. Entries must follow the same format used in the `pg_hba.conf` file.
3.  Modify the `pgpool.conf` file, setting the `enable_pool_hba` parameter to `on`.
4.  Restart Pgpool-II to reload the Pgpool-II configuration files.

!!! Note
    When authenticating with the database server, use the user names and passwords specified in the `pool_hba.conf` file; you must also specify these user names and passwords in the database server's `pg_hba.conf` file.

<div id="pcp_configuration" class="registered_link"></div>

## Configuring PCP

PCP is an administrative interface for Pgpool-II that allows you to retrieve information about database nodes, Pgpool-II child processes, and other information. You should issue PCP commands from the Linux command line.

`pcp.conf` is the password configuration file for the PCP client. Before using PCP commands, you must modify the `pcp.conf` file, providing the user names and passwords you provide when invoking a PCP command. The user names in the `pcp.conf` file are entirely independent of the database server user names and passwords.

Use the following steps to configure PCP:

1.  Copy the `pcp.conf.sample` file to `pcp.conf`.

2.  Add an entry to the `pcp.conf` file in the following form:

    ```text
    username:md5_password
    ```

    where:

    `username` is a PCP user name.

    `md5_password` is the PCP password in `md5` format

    You can use the `pg_md5` program to generate the encrypted password from the clear-text form as shown below:

    ```text
    $ pg_md5 mypassword
    
    34819d7beeabb9260a5c854bc85b3e44
    ```

    For example, the entry in the `pcp.conf` file for a PCP user named `pcpuser` with the password of `mypassword` is:

    ```text
    # USERID:MD5PASSWD
    pcpuser:34819d7beeabb9260a5c854bc85b3e44
    ```

3.  Restart the Pgpool service.

4.  When issuing a PCP command, specify the PCP user name and the unencrypted form of the password:

    ```text
    $ pcp_node_info 5 localhost 9898 pcpuser mypassword 0
    localhost 5444 1 1.000000
    ```

After configuring PCP, you can use the following PCP commands to control Pgpool-II and retrieve information.

| PCP Command              | Description                                                                                              |

## Configuring Number of Connections and Pooling

Pgpool has some configuration to tune the pooling and connection processing. Depending on this
configuration, the Postgres configuration for `max_connections` must also be set to ensure
all connections can be accepted as required. Furthermore, note that the Cloud Architecture works
with active/active instances, which needs to spread `num_init_children` over all Pgpool
instances (divide the normally used value by the number of active instances). The below text
describes the effect of changing the configuration, and advises values for both the on-premise and
the cloud architecture.

**max_pool**: Generally, advised to set `max_pool` to 1. Alternatively, for applications with many reconnects, `max_pool` can be set to the number of distinct combinations of users, databases,
and connection options for the application connections. All but one connection in the pool would
be stale connections, which consume a connection slot from Postgres without adding to the performance.
It is, therefore, advised not to configure `max_pool` beyond 4 to preserve a healthy ratio
between active and stale connections. As an example, for an application that constantly reconnects
and uses two distinct users, both connecting to their own database, set it to 2. If both users
would be able to connect to both databases, set it to 4. Note that increasing `max_pool` requires
to tune down `num_init_children` in Pgpool, or tune up `max_connections` in Postgres.

**num_init_children**: It is advised to set `num_init_children` to the number of connections
that could be running active in parallel, but the value should be divided by the number of active
Pgpool-II instances (one with the on-premise architecture and all instances for the cloud architecture). As an example: In an architecture with 3 Pgpool instances, to allow the application to
have 100 active connections in parallel, set `num_init_children` to 100 for the on-premise architecture, and set `num_init_children` to 33 for the cloud architecture. Note that increasing
`num_init_children` generally requires to tune up `max_connections` in Postgres.

**listen_backlog_multiplier**: Can be set to multiply the number of open connections (as perceived by the application) with the number of active connections (`num_init_children`).
As an example, when the application might open 500 connections, of which 100 should be
active in parallel, with the on-premise architecture, `num_init_children` should be set to
100, and `listen_backlog_multiplier` should be set to 4. This setup can process
100 connections active in parallel, and another 400 (`listen_backlog_multiplier` x
`num_init_children`) connections will be queued before connections will be blocked. The
application would perceive a total of 500 open connections, and Postgres would process the load of
100 connections maximum at all times. Note that increasing `listen_backlog_multiplier`
only causes the application to perceive more connections but will not increase the number of
parallel active connections (which is determined by `num_init_children`).

**max_connections**: It is advised to set `max_connections` in Postgres higher
than [number of active pgpool instances] x [`max_pool`] x [`num_init_children`] +
[`superuser_reserved_connections`] (Postgres). As an example: in the on-premise setup
with 3 instances active/passive, `max_pool` set to 2, `num_init_children` set to 100, and
`superuser_reserved_connections` (Postgres) set to 5, Postgres `max_connections`
should be set equal to or higher than [1 x 2 x 100+5], which is 205 connections, or higher. A similar setup in the cloud
setup would run with 3 active instances, `max_pool` set to 2, `num_init_children`
set to 33, and `superuser_reserved_connections` (Postgres) set to 5, in which case
Postgres `max_connections` should be set equal or higher than [3x 2 x 33+5] which is 203 or
higher. Note that configuring below the advised setting can cause issues opening new connections,
and in combination with `max_pool`, can cause unexpected behavior (low or no active connections but still connection issues due to stale pooled connections using connection slots from
Postgres. For more information on the relation between `num_init_children`, `max_pool`
and `max_connections`, see this background information.

## Pgpool-II Host Setup

After modifying the parameter settings that implement Pgpool-II functionality for your installation, you must start the Pgpool-II service.

When Pgpool-II starts, it records its process ID in a `pgpool.conf` file whose name is determined by the `pid_file_name` configuration parameter. The initial value of the `pid_file_name` parameter in the sample file is:

```text
pid_file_name = /var/run/edb/pgpool<x.y>/edb-pgpool-<x.y>.pid
```

Where &lt;x.y> is the Pgpool release version.

!!! Note
    The operating system may remove the contents of the `/var/run` directory (including the `pgpool` directory) during a reboot. You should not use the `/var/run/edb/pgpool` directory as the location for the `pgpool.pid` file. Modify the `pid_file_name` parameter to specify a safer directory location.
