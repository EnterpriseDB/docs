Modules in the extensions directory are additional features to EDB Postgres Advanced Server, which are generally not included in the core database. Once loaded in a database, they can function just like built-in features. They allow you to use simple `SELECT` commands to use PCP remotely.

!!! Note
    Pgpool-II extensions are only delivered for supported combinations of EDB Postgres Advanced Server versions and operating systems.

Before installing Pgpool-II extensions, install the EDB Postgres Advanced Server on your host system.

## Installing Pgpool-II Extensions

The following section walks you through the steps of installing Pgpool-II extensions. To request credentials for the repository, visit [the EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user).

### Installing Pgpool-II Extension on a CentOS/Rocky Linux/AlmaLinux Host

Assume superuser privileges and perform the following steps to install Pgpool-II extensions on a CentOS host:

1.  To install the repository configuration, assume superuser privileges, and invoke the platform-specific command:

    On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

    On Rocky Linux 8 or AlmaLinux 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

2.  Replace the `USERNAME:PASSWORD` variable with the username and password of a registered EDB user:

    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

3.  Before installing Pgpool, execute the following command to install the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL):

    On CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

    On Rocky Linux 8 or AlmaLinux 8:

    ```text
    dnf -y install epel-release
    ```

4.  For Rocky Linux 8 or AlmaLinux 8, enable the PowerTools repository to satisfy EPEL package dependencies:

    ```text
    dnf config-manager --set-enabled PowerTools
    ```

5.  Use the platform-specific command to install Pgpool-II extensions:

    On RHEL/CentOS 7:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as<xx>-pgpool<yy>-extensions
    ```

    For example, to install Pgpool43 extensions for EDB Postgres Advanced Server 14, execute the following command:

    ```text
    yum -y install edb-as14-pgpool43-extensions
    ```

    On RHEL/CentOS 8:

    ```text
    dnf install edb-as<xx>-pgpool<yy>-extensions
    ```

In the above command, `<xx>` is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version, and `<yy>` is the Pgpool-II extension version. The extensions will be available in the `/usr/edb/as<xx>/share/extension` directory.

    ```

3.  Invoke the following command to refresh the metadata:

    ```text
    zypper refresh
    ```

4.  Install `SUSEConnect` to register the host with SUSE to allow access to SUSE repositories:

    ```text
    zypper install SUSEConnect
    ```

5.  Register the host with SUSE to allow access to SUSE repositories and replace `'REGISTRATION_CODE'` and `'EMAIL'` with your SUSE registration information:

    ```text
    SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'
    SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/x86_64
    SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/x86_64
    ```

6.  Refresh the metadata:

    ```text
    zypper refresh
    ```

7.  Then, use the Zypper utility to install Pgpool-II extension:

    ```text
    zypper -n install edb-as<xx>-pgpool<yy>-extensions
    ```

    Where &lt;xx> is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version and &lt;yy> is the Pgpool version you wish to install.

## Creating Pgpool-II Extensions

You must install and create the extensions in each database where you will be using Pgpool-II functionality. To ensure all extensions are available for future databases, you can add the extension to the `template1` database; any extensions installed in the `template1` database will be created in each of the databases that uses `template1` as a template during creation.

**Pgpool_adm Extension**

<div id="pgpool_adm" class="registered_link"></div>

`Pgpool_adm` is a set of extensions that allows SQL access to PCP commands. To view information about PCP commands, see <https://www.pgpool.net/docs/latest/en/html/pcp-commands.html>.
   
After installing the `Pgpool_adm` extension, use the psql client application to connect to the database, and execute the following SQL command:

```text
CREATE EXTENSION pgpool_adm;
```

To view more information about `Pgpool_adm`, see <https://www.pgpool.net/docs/latest/en/html/pgpool-adm.html>.

**Pgpool_recovery Extension**

<div id="pgpool_recovery" class="registered_link"></div>

The `Pgpool_recovery` extension is required for online recovery and future fail-back mechanisms.

After installing the `Pgpool_recovery` extension, use psql to connect to the database, and execute the following SQL command to create a `Pgpool_recovery` extension:

```text
CREATE EXTENSION pgpool_recovery;
```

For more information about using the `CREATE EXTENSION` command, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createextension.html).
