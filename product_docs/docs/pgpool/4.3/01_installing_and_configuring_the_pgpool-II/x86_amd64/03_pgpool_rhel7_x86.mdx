Before creating the repository configuration file, you must have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user).

Perform the following steps to install EDB Pgpool-II:

1.  To create the repository configuration file, assume superuser privileges, and invoke the following command:
    ```text
    yum -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

2.  Replace the `USERNAME:PASSWORD` variable in the following command with the username and password of a registered EDB user:
    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

3.  Invoke the following command to install the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL):
    ```text
    yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm
    ```

4.  Enable the `optional`, `extras`, and `HA` repositories to satisfy additional package dependencies:
    ```text
    subscription-manager repos --enable "rhel-*-optional-rpms" --enable "rhel-*-extras-rpms"  --enable "rhel-ha-for-rhel-*-server-rpms"
    ```

6.  Install EDB Pgpool-II:
    ```text
    yum install edb-pgpool<xx>
    ```

    where &lt;xx> is the EDB Pgpool release version.

    For example, to install EDB Pgpool 4.3, invoke the following command:
    ```text
    yum install edb-pgpool43
    ```

    When you install an RPM package that is signed by a source that is not recognized by your system, your permission to import the key to your local server may be asked for. If prompted, and you are satisfied that the packages come from a trustworthy source, enter `y`, and press `Return` to continue.

    EDB Pgpool-II will be installed in the `/usr/edb/pgpool<x.y>/` directory, where &lt;x.y> is the installed EDB Pgpool-II version number.
