title: Installing EDB Pgpool-II on RHEL 7 or OL 7 x86_64
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on the same host. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux).

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Address other prerequisites

  ```shell
  # Install the EPEL repository:
  sudo yum -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

  # Enable additional repositories to resolve dependencies:
  subscription-manager repos --enable "rhel-*-optional-rpms" --enable "rhel-*-extras-rpms"  --enable "rhel-ha-for-rhel-*-server-rpms"

  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo yum -y install edb-pgpool<xx>
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB PgPool-II you are installing. For example, if you are installing version 4.3, the package name would be `edb-pgpool43`.
