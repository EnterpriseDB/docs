Modules in the extensions directory are additional features to EDB Postgres Advanced Server that are generally not included in the core database. Once loaded in a database, they can function just like built-in features. They allow you to use simple `SELECT` commands to use PCP remotely.

!!! Note
    EDB Pgpool-II extensions are delivered only for supported combinations of EDB Postgres Advanced Server versions and operating systems.

Before installing EDB Pgpool-II extensions, install the EDB Postgres Advanced Server on your host system.

### Installing EDB Pgpool-II extensions on an SLES 12 ppc64le host

!!! note
    Supported on EDB Pgpool-II Extension 4.3 and later.

There are two steps to completing an installation:

- Setting up the repository
- Installing the package


For each step, you must be logged in as superuser.

```shell
# To log in as a superuser:
sudo su -
```

Before setting up the repository, you need to register with EDB. To receive credentials for the EDB repository, visit: [Repository Access Request](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repository-access-request).

#### Setting up the repository

Setting up the repository is a one time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform these steps.

```shell
# Install the repository configuration and enter your EDB repository 
# credentials when prompted
zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo

# Install SUSEConnect to register the host with SUSE, allowing access to 
# SUSE repositories
zypper install SUSEConnect

# Register the host with SUSE, allowing access to SUSE repositories
# Replace 'REGISTRATION_CODE' and 'EMAIL' with your SUSE registration 
# information
SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'

# Activate the required SUSE modules
SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/ppc64le
SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/ppc64le

# Refresh the metadata
zypper refresh
```

#### Installing the package

```shell
zypper -n install edb-as<xx>-pgpool<yy>-extensions
```

Where &lt;xx> is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version and &lt;yy> is the EDB Pgpool-II version you wish to install.

```

Where &lt;xx> is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version and &lt;yy> is the EDB Pgpool-II version you wish to install.

## Creating EDB Pgpool-II extensions

You must install and create the extensions in each database where you will be using EDB Pgpool-II functionality. To ensure all extensions are available for future databases, you can add the extension to the `template1` database; any extensions installed in the `template1` database will be created in each of the databases that uses `template1` as a template during creation.

**Pgpool_adm Extension**

<div id="pgpool_adm" class="registered_link"></div>

`Pgpool_adm` is a set of extensions that allows SQL access to PCP commands. To view information about PCP commands, see <https://www.pgpool.net/docs/latest/en/html/pcp-commands.html>.
   
After installing the `Pgpool_adm` extension, use the psql client application to connect to the database, and execute the following SQL command:

```text
CREATE EXTENSION pgpool_adm;
```

To view more information about `Pgpool_adm`, see <https://www.pgpool.net/docs/latest/en/html/pgpool-adm.html>.

**Pgpool_recovery Extension**

<div id="pgpool_recovery" class="registered_link"></div>

The `Pgpool_recovery` extension is required for online recovery and future fail-back mechanisms.

After installing the `Pgpool_recovery` extension, use psql to connect to the database, and execute the following SQL command to create a `Pgpool_recovery` extension:

```text
CREATE EXTENSION pgpool_recovery;
```

For more information about using the `CREATE EXTENSION` command, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createextension.html).
