title: Installing EDB Pgpool-II Extensions on AlmaLinux 8 or Rocky Linux 8 x86_64
---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on the same host. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux).

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

## Install the package

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-pgpool<xx>
```

Where `<xx>` is the version of EDB PgPool-II you are installing. For example, if you are installing version 4.3, the package name would be `edb-pgpool43`.
