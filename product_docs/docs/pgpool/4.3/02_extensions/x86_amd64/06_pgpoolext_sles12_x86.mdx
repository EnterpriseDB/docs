You can use the Zypper package manager to install the EDB Pgpool-II extension on an SLES 12 host. Zypper will attempt to satisfy package dependencies as it installs a package but requires access to specific repositories that are not hosted at EDB.

1.  Assume superuser privileges.
    ```text
    sudo su -
    ```

2.  Use the following command to add the EDB repository to your SLES host:
    ```text
    zypper addrepo https://zypp.enterprisedb.com/suse/edb-sles.repo
    ```

4.  Install `SUSEConnect` to register the host with SUSE to allow access to SUSE repositories:
    ```text
    zypper install SUSEConnect
    ```

5.  Register the host with SUSE to allow access to SUSE repositories and replace `'REGISTRATION_CODE'` and `'EMAIL'` with your SUSE registration information:
    ```text
    SUSEConnect -r 'REGISTRATION_CODE' -e 'EMAIL'
    SUSEConnect -p PackageHub/12.5/x86_64
    SUSEConnect -p sle-sdk/12.5/x86_64
    ```

6.  Refresh the metadata:
    ```text
    zypper refresh
    ```

7.  Use the Zypper utility to install EDB Pgpool-II extension:
    ```text
    zypper -n install edb-as<xx>-pgpool<yy>-extensions
    ```

    Where &lt;xx> is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version and &lt;yy> is the EDB Pgpool-II version you wish to install.
