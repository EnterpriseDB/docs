Before installing the repository configuration, you must have credentials that allow access to the EDB repository. For information about requesting credentials, visit the [EDB website](https://www.enterprisedb.com/user).

Perform the following steps to install EDB Pgpool-II extensions on an RHEL host:

1.  To install the repository configuration, assume superuser privileges, and invoke the following command:
    ```text
    dnf -y install https://yum.enterprisedb.com/edbrepos/edb-repo-latest.noarch.rpm
    ```

2.  Replace the `USERNAME:PASSWORD` variable in the following command with the username and password of a registered EDB user:
    ```text
    sed -i "s@<username>:<password>@USERNAME:PASSWORD@" /etc/yum.repos.d/edb.repo
    ```

3.  Before installing EDB Pgpool-II, execute the following command to install the Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL):
    ```text
    dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
    ```

4.  Enable the `codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-*-rpms` repository to satisfy EPEL packages dependency:
    ```text
    ARCH=$( /bin/arch )

    subscription-manager repos --enable "codeready-builder-for-rhel-8-${ARCH}-rpms"
    ```

5.  Install EDB Pgpool-II extensions:
    ```text
    dnf install edb-as<xx>-pgpool<yy>-extensions
    ```

In the above command, `<xx>` is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version, and `<yy>` is the EDB Pgpool-II extension version. The extensions will be available in the `/usr/edb/as<xx>/share/extension` directory.
