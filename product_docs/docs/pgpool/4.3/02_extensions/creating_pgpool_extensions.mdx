title: "Creating Pgpool-II extensions"
---

You must install and create the extensions in each database where you will be using EDB Pgpool-II functionality. To ensure all extensions are available for future databases, you can add the extension to the `template1` database; any extensions installed in the `template1` database will be created in each of the databases that uses `template1` as a template during creation.

**Pgpool_adm Extension**

`Pgpool_adm` is a set of extensions that allows SQL access to PCP commands. To view information about PCP commands, see <https://www.pgpool.net/docs/latest/en/html/pcp-commands.html>.
   
After installing the `Pgpool_adm` extension, use the psql client application to connect to the database, and execute the following SQL command:

```text
CREATE EXTENSION pgpool_adm;
```

**Pgpool_recovery Extension**

<div id="pgpool_recovery" class="registered_link"></div>

The `Pgpool_recovery` extension is required for online recovery and future fail-back mechanisms.

After installing the `Pgpool_recovery` extension, use psql to connect to the database, and execute the following SQL command to create a `Pgpool_recovery` extension:

```text
CREATE EXTENSION pgpool_recovery;
```

For more information about using the `CREATE EXTENSION` command, see the [PostgreSQL core documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/sql-createextension.html).
