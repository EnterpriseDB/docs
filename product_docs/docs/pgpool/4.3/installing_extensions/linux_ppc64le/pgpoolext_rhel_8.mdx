## Prerequisites

Before you begin the installation process:

- Install EDB Postgres Advanced Server on the same host. See [Installing EDB Postgres Advanced Server](/epas/latest/epas_inst_linux).

- Set up the repository

  Setting up the repository is a one-time task. If you have already set up your repository, you do not need to perform this step.

  To set up the repository, go to [EDB repositories](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) and follow the instructions provided there.

- Address other prerequisites

  ```shell
  # Install the EPEL repository:
  sudo dnf -y install https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm

  # Refresh the cache:
  sudo dnf makecache

  #  Disable the built-in PostgreSQL module:
  sudo dnf -qy module disable postgresql
  ```

## Install the package

```shell
sudo dnf -y install edb-as-<xx>-pgpool<yy>-extensions
```

Where `<xx>` is the EDB Postgres Advanced Server version and `<yy>` is the EDB Pgpool-II version you are installing. For example, if you are installing EDB Pgpool-II version 4.3 and EDB Postgres Advanced Server version 14, the package name would be `edb-as-14-pgpool43-extensions`.
