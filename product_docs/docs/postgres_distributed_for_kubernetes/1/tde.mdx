!!! Important
    TDE is available *only* for operands that support it:
    EPAS versions 15 and newer, Postgres Extended versions 15 and newer.

Transparent Data Encryption, or TDE, is a technology used by several database
vendors to **encrypt data at rest**, i.e. database files on disk.
TDE does not however encrypt data in use.

TDE is included in EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS) or EDB Postgres
Extended, starting with version 15, and it is supported by EDB Postgres
Distributed for Kubernetes.

!!! Important
    Before you proceed, please take some time to familiarize with the
    [TDE feature in the EPAS documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/tde/latest/).

With TDE activated, both WAL files and files for tables will be encrypted.
Data encryption/decryption is entirely transparent to the user, as it is
managed by the database without requiring any application changes or updated
client drivers.

The support for TDE on EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes relies on the
implementation from EDB Postgres for Kubernetes (PG4K). Please refer to
[the PG4K documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/tde/)
for the full context.

We show now how to use TDE with a passphrase stored in a Kubernetes Secret,
which will be used to encrypt the EPAS binary key.

!!! Seealso "EPAS documentation"
    Please refer to [the EPAS documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/tde/latest/key_stores/)
    for details on the EPAS encryption key.

TDE on EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes relies on the PG4K
implementation.
To activate TDE on a cluster, we use the `epas` section of the manifest,
which is within the `cnp` section used for PG4K-level directives such as
storage.
Use the `tde` stanza to enable TDE, and set the name of the Kubernetes secret
holding the TDE encryption key.

The following YAML portion contains both a secret holding a passphrase
(base-64 encoded), and the `epas` section activating TDE with the passphrase.

```

Again, please refer to [the PG4K documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/tde/)
for additional depth, including how to create the encryption secret and
additional ways of using TDE.

As shown in the [TDE feature documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/tde/latest/),
the information will be encrypted at rest.

For example, open a `psql` terminal into one of your data nodes.

```sh
kubectl exec -ti <DATA-NODE> -- psql app
```

and create a new table including a text column.

```sql
create table foo(bar int, baz varchar);
insert into foo(bar, baz) values (1, 'hello'), (2, 'goodbye');
```

And then verify the location where the newly defined table is stored on disk:

```sql
select pg_relation_filepath('foo');
 pg_relation_filepath 
----------------------
 base/16385/16387
```

You can open a terminal on the same data node:

```sh
kubectl exec -ti <DATA-NODE> -- bash
```

and verify the file has been encrypted.

```sh
cd $PGDATA/base/16385
hexdump -C 16387 | grep hello
hexdump -C 16387 | grep goodbye
```
