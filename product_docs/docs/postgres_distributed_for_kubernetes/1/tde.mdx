!!! Important
    TDE is available *only* for operands that support it:
    EDB Postgres Advanced Server versions 15 and newer and EDB Postgres Extended versions 15 and newer.

Transparent data encryption, or TDE, is a technology used by several database
vendors to encrypt data at rest, that is, database files on disk.
However, TDE doesn't encrypt data in use.

TDE is included in EDB Postgres Advanced Server or EDB Postgres
Extended, starting with version 15, and is supported by EDB Postgres
Distributed for Kubernetes.

!!! Important
    Before you proceed, take some time to familiarize with the
    [TDE feature in the EDB Postgres Advanced Server documentation](/tde/latest/).

With TDE activated, both WAL files and files for tables are encrypted.
Data encryption/decryption is entirely transparent to the user, as it's
managed by the database without requiring any application changes or updated
client drivers.

The support for TDE on EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes relies on the
implementation from EDB Postgres for Kubernetes (PG4K). See
[the PG4K documentation](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/tde/)
for the full context.

You can use TDE with a passphrase stored in a Kubernetes secret,
which is used to encrypt the EDB Postgres Advanced Server binary key.

!!! Seealso "EDB Postgres Advanced Server documentation"
    See [the EDB Posgres Advanced Server documentation](/tde/latest/secure_key/)
    for details on the this encryption key.

TDE on EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes relies on the PG4K
implementation.
Activating TDE on a cluster uses the `epas` section of the manifest,
which is in the `cnp` section used for PG4K-level directives such as
storage.
Use the `tde` stanza to enable TDE, and set the name of the Kubernetes secret
holding the TDE encryption key.

The following YAML portion contains both a secret holding a passphrase
(base-64 encoded), and the `epas` section activating TDE with the passphrase.

```yaml

            name: tde-key
            key: key
    storage:
      size: 1Gi
```

Again, see [the PG4K documentation](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/tde/)
for additional depth, including how to create the encryption secret and
additional ways of using TDE.

As shown in the [TDE feature documentation](/tde/latest/),
the information is encrypted at rest.

For example, open a psql terminal into one of your data nodes.

```sh
kubectl exec -ti <DATA-NODE> -- psql app
```

Create a new table including a text column:

```sql
create table foo(bar int, baz varchar);
insert into foo(bar, baz) values (1, 'hello'), (2, 'goodbye');
```

Verify the location where the newly defined table is stored on disk:

```sql
select pg_relation_filepath('foo');
 pg_relation_filepath 
----------------------
 base/16385/16387
```

You can open a terminal on the same data node:

```sh
kubectl exec -ti <DATA-NODE> -- bash
```

There, you can verify the file was encrypted:

```sh
cd $PGDATA/base/16385
hexdump -C 16387 | grep hello
hexdump -C 16387 | grep goodbye
```
