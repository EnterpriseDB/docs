The PGD operator allows configuring the `managed` section of a PG4K cluster. The `spec.cnp.managed` stanza
is used for configuring the supported managed roles within the cluster.

In this example, a pgdgroup is configured to have a managed role named `foo` with the specified properties set up in postgres.

```yaml
apiVersion: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1beta1
kind: PGDGroup
metadata:
  name: group-example-with-managed
spec:
  [...]
  cnp:
    [...]
    managed:
      roles:
        - name: foo
          comment: Foo
          ensure: present
          connectionLimit: 100
          login: true
          superuser: true
          createdb: true
          createrole: true
          replication: true
```
