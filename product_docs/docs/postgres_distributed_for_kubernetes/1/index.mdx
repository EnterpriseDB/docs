    We're in the process of migrating the documentation from the previous EDB
    Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes name to the new EDB Postgres® AI for

EDB Postgres® AI for CloudNativePG™ Global Cluster (also `CNPG-GC` or `PGD4K`) is an
operator designed to manage EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) workloads on
Kubernetes, with traffic routed by PGD Proxy.

The main custom resource that the operator provides is called `PGDGroup`.

Architectures can also be deployed across different Kubernetes clusters.

## Before you start

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes provides you with a way to deploy
EDB Postgres Distributed in a Kubernetes environment. Therefore, we recommend
reading the
[EDB Postgres Distributed documentation](/pgd/latest/).

To start working with EDB Postgres
Distributed for Kubernetes, read the following in the PGD documentation:

-   [Terminology](/pgd/latest/terminology/)
-   [PGD overview](/pgd/latest/reference/overview/)
-   [Choosing your architecture](/pgd/latest/expanded-how-to/architectures/always-on/)
-   [Choosing a Postgres distribution](/pgd/5.9/planning/choosing_server/)

For advanced usage and maximum customization, it's also important to be familiar with the
[EDB Postgres for Kubernetes documentation](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/),
as described in [Architecture](architecture.md#relationship-with-edb-postgres-for-kubernetes).

## Supported Kubernetes distributions

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes is available for:

-   Kubernetes version 1.23 or later through a Helm chart
-   Red Hat OpenShift version 4.10 or later only through the Red Hat OpenShift
    certified operator

## Requirements

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes requires that the Kubernetes/OpenShift
clusters hosting the distributed PGD cluster were prepared by you to cater for:

-   The public key infrastructure (PKI) encompassing all the Kubernetes clusters
    the PGD global group is spread across. mTLS is required to authenticate
    and authorize all nodes in the mesh topology and guarantee encrypted communication.
-   Networking infrastructure across all Kubernetes clusters involved in the
    PGD global group to ensure that each node can communicate with each other

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes also requires Cert Manager 1.10 or later.
