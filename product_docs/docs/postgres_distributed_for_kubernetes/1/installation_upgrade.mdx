## Installing the Operator on Kubernetes

### Obtaining an EDB subscription token

!!! Important
    You must obtain an EDB subscription token to install EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes. The token
    will grant access to the EDB private software repositories.

Installing EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes requires an EDB Repos 2.0 token to gain access to the EDB private software repositories.

You can obtain the token by visiting your [EDB Account Profile](https://www.enterprisedb.com/accounts/profile). You will have to sign in if you are not already logged in.

Your account profile page displays the token next to the label Repos 2.0 Token. By default, the token is obscured. Click the "Show" button (an eye icon) to reveal it.

Your token entitles you to access one of two repositories: `standard` or `enterprise`.

-   `standard` - Includes the operators and the EDB Postgres Extended operand images.
-   `enterprise` - Includes the operators, and the operand images for EDB Postgres Advanced and EDB Postgres Extended.

Set the relevant value, determined by your subscription, as an environment variable `EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN`.

```shell
EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN=enterprise
```

then set the Repos 2.0 token as an environment variable `EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN`.

```shell
EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

!!! Warning

    The token is sensitive information. Please ensure that you don't expose it to unauthorized users.

You can now proceed with the installation.

### Using the Helm Chart

The operator can be installed using the provided [Helm chart](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/edb-postgres-for-kubernetes-charts).

### Directly using the operator manifest

We can deploy the EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes operator directly using the manifest.
This manifest will install both `EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes operator` and the latest
supported `EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator` in the same namespace. To deploy the operators
using the manifest, follow the steps below:

#### Install the cert-manager

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes requires Cert Manager 1.10 or higher. You can follow the
[installation guide](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/) or use the
command below to deploy cert-manager.

```shell
kubectl apply -f \
  https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.16.2/cert-manager.yaml
```

#### Install the EDB pull secret

Before installing EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes, you need to create a *pull secret* for
the EDB container registry.

The pull secret needs to be saved in the namespace where the operator will reside (`pgd-operator-system` by default).
Create the `pgd-operator-system` namespace using this command:

```shell
kubectl create namespace pgd-operator-system
```

To create the pull secret, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl create secret -n pgd-operator-system docker-registry edb-pull-secret \
  --docker-server=docker.enterprisedb.com \
  --docker-username=k8s_${EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN}_pgd \
  --docker-password=${EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN}
```

#### Install the operator manifest

Now that the pull-secret has been added to the namespace, the operator can be installed like any other resource in Kubernetes,
through a YAML manifest applied via `kubectl`.

There are two different manifests available depending on your subscription plan:

-   Standard: The [latest standard operator manifest](https://get.enterprisedb.io/pg4k-pgd/pg4k-pgd-standard-1.1.1.yaml).
-   Enterprise: The [latest enterprise operator manifest](https://get.enterprisedb.io/pg4k-pgd/pg4k-pgd-enterprise-1.1.1.yaml).

You can install the manifest for the latest version of the operator by running:

```sh
kubectl apply --server-side -f \
  https://get.enterprisedb.io/pg4k-pgd/pg4k-pgd-${EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN}-1.1.1.yaml
```

You can check the operator deployment with the following command:

```sh
kubectl get deployment -n pgd-operator-system pgd-operator-controller-manager
```

!!! Note

    As EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes internally manages each PGD node using the
    `Cluster` resource defined by EDB Postgres for Kubernetes, we also need to have the
    EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator installed as a dependency. The manifest used
    above contains a well-tested version of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator, which will
    be installed into the same namespace as the EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes operator.

## Details about the deployment

In Kubernetes, the operator is by default installed in the `pgd-operator-system`
namespace as a Kubernetes `Deployment`. The name of this deployment depends on the installation method.
When installed through the manifest, by default, it is named `pgd-operator-controller-manager`.
When installed via Helm, by default, the deployment name is derived from the helm release name, appended with the
suffix `-edb-postgres-distributed-for-kubernetes` (i.e., `<name>-edb-postgres-distributed-for-kubernetes`).

!!! Note

    With Helm you can customize the name of the deployment via the
    `fullnameOverride` field in the [*"values.yaml"* file](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files/).

You can get more information using the `describe` command in `kubectl`:

```sh
$ kubectl get deployments -n pgd-operator-system
NAME                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
<deployment-name>   1/1     1            1           18m
```

```sh
kubectl describe deploy \
  -n pgd-operator-system \
  <deployment-name>
```

As with any Deployment, it sits on top of a ReplicaSet and supports rolling upgrades. The
default configuration of the EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes operator is
a Deployment of a single replica, which is suitable for most installations. If the
node where the pod is running is not reachable anymore, the pod will be rescheduled on
another node.

If you require high availability at the operator level, it is possible to specify multiple
replicas in the Deployment configuration, given that the operator supports leader election.
In addition, you can take advantage of taints and tolerations to make sure that the operator does
not run on the same nodes where the actual PostgreSQL clusters are running (this might even
include the control plane for self-managed Kubernetes installations).

!!! Seealso "Operator configuration"

    You can change the default behavior of the operator by overriding
    some default options. For more information, please refer to the
    ["Operator configuration"](operator_conf.md) section.

## Deploy PGD Clusters

Be sure to create a cert issuer before you start deploying PGD clusters.
The Helm chart prompts you to do this, but in case you miss it,
you can, for example, run:

```sh
kubectl apply -f \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnterpriseDB/edb-postgres-for-kubernetes-charts/main/hack/samples/issuer-selfsigned.yaml
```

With the operators and a self-signed cert issuer deployed, you can start
creating PGD clusters. See the
[Quick start](quickstart.md#part-3---deploy-a-pgd-cluster) for an example.

### Default Operand images

By default, each operator release binds a default version and flavor for PGD and PGD Proxy images.
If the image names
are not specified in the `spec.pgd.imageName` and `spec.pgdproxy.imageName` fields of the pgdgroup YAML file, the default
images will be used.

Default images can be overwritten using the `pgd-operator-controller-manager-config` operator configuration map.
For more details, see the section on [EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes Operator configuration](operator_conf.md#edb-postgres-distributed-for-kubernetes-operator-configuration).

We can find what images PGD cluster is using by checking the PGDGroup status:

```sh
kubectl get pgdgroup <pgdgroup name> -o yaml | yq ".status.image"
```

### Specifying operand images

Here is an example of a PGD Cluster using explicit image names:

```yaml
apiVersion: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1beta1
kind: PGDGroup
metadata:
  name: group-example-customized
spec:
  instances: 2
  proxyInstances: 2
  witnessInstances: 1
  imageName: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-postgres-extended-pgd:17.4-5.7.0-1
  imagePullSecrets:
  - name: registry-pullsecret
  pgd:
    parentGroup:
      name: world
      create: true
  cnp:
    storage:
      size: 1Gi
  pgdProxy:
    imageName: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-pgd-proxy:5.7.1-1
```

### Specifying operand images using ImageCatalog

Since the release of version 1.1.1, the PGD4K-PGD operator supports using `ImageCatalog` to specify operand images.

Different `ImageCatalogs` are available based on your subscription plan and PGD versions for each PostgreSQL flavor.
Note that the image included in the `ImageCatalog` are ubi-9 based.

-   EDB Postgres Advanced PGD:
    <https://get.enterprisedb.io/pgd-k8s-image-catalogs/epas-k8s->&lt;EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN>-pgd-&lt;PGD_VERSION>.yaml
-   EDB Postgres Extended PGD:
    <https://get.enterprisedb.io/pgd-k8s-image-catalogs/pgextended-k8s->&lt;EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN>-pgd-&lt;PGD_VERSION>.yaml
-   Postgres Community PGD:
    <https://get.enterprisedb.io/pgd-k8s-image-catalogs/postgresql-k8s->&lt;EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN>-pgd-&lt;PGD_VERSION>.yaml

We can create an `Imagecatalog` in the PGD Cluster namespace and reference it in your YAML file.

Let's create an EDB Postgres Extended PGD 5.7 `ImageCatalog`:

```sh
kubectl create -f \
        https://get.enterprisedb.io/pgd-k8s-image-catalogs/epas-k8s-enterprise-pgd-5.7.yaml
```

The following example shows how to use the EDB Postgres Extended PGD 5.7 `ImageCatalog` to
specify a PostgreSQL major version of 17 for the PGD operand image. The PGD proxy image is automatically sourced from
the `ImageCatalog`.

```yaml
apiVersion: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1beta1
kind: PGDGroup
metadata:
  name: group-example-catalog
spec:
  instances: 2
  proxyInstances: 2
  witnessInstances: 1
  imageCatalogRef:
    apiGroup: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io
    kind: ImageCatalog
    major: 17
    name: epas-enterprise-pgd-5.7
...
```

## Upgrade

!!! Important

    Please carefully read the [release notes](rel_notes/)
    before performing an upgrade, as some versions might
    require extra steps.

The EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes (PGD4K) operator relies on the
EDB Postgres for Kubernetes (PG4K) operator to manage clusters. To upgrade the EDB PGD4K
operator, the PG4K operator must also be upgraded to a supported version. It is recommended
to keep the EDB PG4K operator on the [Long Term Support (LTS)](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/#long-term-support)
version, as this is the tested version compatible with the PGD4K operator.

To upgrade the EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) for Kubernetes operator, follow these steps:

1.  Upgrade the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator as a dependency
2.  Upgrade the PGD4K controller and the related Kubernetes resources

Note that when you upgrade the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator, the instance manager on
each PGD node will also be upgraded. For more details, please refer to the
[EDB Postgres for Kubernetes upgrades documentation](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/installation_upgrade/#upgrades).

Unless differently stated in the release notes, those steps are normally done by applying the manifest of the newer version for plain Kubernetes installations.

### Compatibility among versions

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes (PGD4K) follows semantic versioning.
Every release of the operator within the same API version is compatible with the
previous one. The current API version is v1, corresponding to versions 1.x.y of
the operator.

The `minor` version of PGD4K operator is tracking a PG4K LTS release change.
For example:

-   PGD4K operator 1.0.x is fully tested against PG4K LTS 1.22.
-   PGD4K operator 1.1.x is fully tested against PG4K LTS 1.25.

A PGD4K operator release has the same support scope as the PG4K LTS release it is tracking.

In addition to new features, new versions of the operator contain bug fixes and
stability enhancements.
Each version is released in order to maintain the most secure and stable
Postgres environment. Because of this, **we strongly encourage users to upgrade
to the latest version of the operator**.

The [release notes](rel_notes/) page contains a detailed list of the
changes introduced in every released version of EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes,
and it must be read before upgrading to a newer version of the software.

Most versions are directly upgradable, and in that case, simply applying the
newer manifest for plain Kubernetes installations will complete the upgrade.

When versions are not directly upgradable, the old version (of both PGD4K and PG4K)
needs to be removed before installing the new one. This won't affect user data, only the operator itself.

### Upgrading to 1.0.1 on Red Hat OpenShift

On the openshift platform, starting from version 1.0.1, the EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes
operator is required to reference the LTS releases of the PG4K operator. For example,
PGD4K v1.0.1 specifically references the PG4K LTS version 1.22.x (any patch release of the 1.22 LTS branch is valid).

To upgrade PGD4K operator, ensure that the PG4K operator is upgraded to a supported
version first. Only then can the PGD4K operator be upgraded.

!!! Important

    As PGD4K v1.0.0 does not require referencing an LTS release of the PG4K operator,
    it may have been installed with any PG4K version. If the installed PG4K version is
    less than 1.22, you can upgrade to PG4K version 1.22 by changing the subscription
    channel. For more information, see [upgrading the operator](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/openshift/#upgrading-the-operator). However, if the installed PG4K version
    is greater than 1.22, you will need to reinstall the operator from the stable-1.22
    channel to upgrade PGD4K to v1.0.1.

### Server-side apply of manifests

To ensure compatibility with Kubernetes 1.29 and upcoming versions,
EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes now mandates the utilization of
["Server-side apply"](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/)
when deploying the operator manifest.

While employing this installation method poses no challenges for new
deployments, updating existing operator manifests using the `--server-side`
option may result in errors like the example below:

```text
Apply failed with 1 conflict: conflict with "kubectl-client-side-apply" using..
```

If such errors arise, they can be resolved by explicitly specifying the
`--force-conflicts` option to enforce conflict resolution:

```sh
kubectl apply --server-side --force-conflicts -f <OPERATOR_MANIFEST>
```

From then on, `kube-apiserver` will be automatically acknowledged as a recognized
manager for the CRDs, eliminating the need for any further manual intervention
on this matter.

### Upgrading operands

The PGD Cluster supports in-place upgrades of the operand image's minor version,
though the PostgreSQL service will be temporarily unavailable during the upgrade.

#### Checking Current PGD and Proxy Versions

Before upgrading, you can check the current PGD and PGD proxy versions with the following command:

```sh
kubectl get pgdgroup <pgdgroup name> -o yaml | yq ".status.image"
```

#### Upgrade Procedure

-   Using Default or Customized Image Name:
    To upgrade the operand to a new minor version, replace the imageName in the
    `spec.imageName` and `spec.pgdproxy.imageName` sections of the PGD group YAML file with the new imageName. The images on each node will be upgraded sequentially and restarted accordingly.

-   Using Image Catalog:
    If the PGD Cluster manages image versions using an `ImageCatalog`, simply upgrade the
    image version specified in the referenced `ImageCatalog`. The PGD Cluster will automatically
    apply the new image version.
