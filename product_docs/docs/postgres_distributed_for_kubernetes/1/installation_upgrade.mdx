## Installing the operator on Kubernetes

### Obtaining an EDB subscription token

!!! Important
    You must obtain an EDB subscription token to install EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes. The token
    grants access to the EDB private software repositories.

Installing EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes requires an EDB Repos 2.0 token to gain access to the EDB private software repositories.

You can obtain the token by visiting your [EDB Account Profile](https://www.enterprisedb.com/accounts/profile). You will have to sign in if you aren't already logged in.

Your account profile page displays the token next to the label **Repos 2.0 Token**. By default, the token is obscured. Select **Show** (an eye icon) to reveal it.

Your token entitles you to access one of two repositories: `standard` or `enterprise`.

-   `standard` - Includes the operators and the EDB Postgres Extended operand images.
-   `enterprise` - Includes the operators and the operand images for EDB Postgres Advanced and EDB Postgres Extended.

Set the relevant value, determined by your subscription, as an environment variable `EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN`:

```shell
EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN=enterprise
```

Then set the Repos 2.0 token as an environment variable `EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN`:

```shell
EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN=<your-token>
```

!!! Warning
    The token is sensitive information. Ensure that you don't expose it to unauthorized users.

You can now proceed with the installation.

### Using the Helm chart

You can install the operator using the provided [Helm chart](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/edb-postgres-for-kubernetes-charts).

### Directly using the operator manifest

You can deploy the EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes operator directly using the manifest.
This manifest installs both EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes operator and the latest
supported EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator in the same namespace. 

#### Install the cert-manager

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes requires Cert Manager 1.10 or higher. You can follow the
[installation guide](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/) or use this
command to deploy cert-manager:

```shell
kubectl apply -f \
  https://github.com/cert-manager/cert-manager/releases/download/v1.16.2/cert-manager.yaml
```

#### Install the EDB pull secret

Before installing EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes, you need to create a *pull secret* for
the EDB container registry.

The pull secret needs to be saved in the namespace where the operator will reside (`pgd-operator-system` by default).
Create the `pgd-operator-system` namespace using this command:

```shell
kubectl create namespace pgd-operator-system
```

To create the pull secret, run the following command:

```shell
kubectl create secret -n pgd-operator-system docker-registry edb-pull-secret \
  --docker-server=docker.enterprisedb.com \
  --docker-username=k8s_${EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN}_pgd \
  --docker-password=${EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN}
```

#### Install the operator manifest

After the pull-secret is added to the namespace, you can install the operator like any other resource in Kubernetes:
through a YAML manifest applied via `kubectl`.

Two different manifests are available, depending on your subscription plan:

-   Standard: The [latest standard operator manifest](https://get.enterprisedb.io/pg4k-pgd/pg4k-pgd-standard-1.1.2.yaml).
-   Enterprise: The [latest enterprise operator manifest](https://get.enterprisedb.io/pg4k-pgd/pg4k-pgd-enterprise-1.1.2.yaml).

To install the manifest for the latest version of the operator:

```sh
kubectl apply --server-side -f \
  https://get.enterprisedb.io/pg4k-pgd/pg4k-pgd-${EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN}-1.1.2.yaml
```

Check the operator deployment:

```sh
kubectl get deployment -n pgd-operator-system pgd-operator-controller-manager
```

!!! Note
    As EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes internally manages each PGD node using the
    `Cluster` resource defined by EDB Postgres for Kubernetes, you also need to have the
    EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator installed as a dependency. The manifest used
    above contains a well-tested version of EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator, which will
    be installed into the same namespace as the EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes operator.

## Details about the deployment

In Kubernetes, the operator is by default installed in the `pgd-operator-system`
namespace as a Kubernetes `Deployment`. The name of this deployment depends on the installation method.
When installed through the manifest, by default it's named `pgd-operator-controller-manager`.
When installed via Helm, by default the deployment name is derived from the Helm release name, appended with the
suffix `-edb-postgres-distributed-for-kubernetes` (that is, `<name>-edb-postgres-distributed-for-kubernetes`).

!!! Note
    With Helm, you can customize the name of the deployment via the
    `fullnameOverride` field in the [*"values.yaml"* file](https://helm.sh/docs/chart_template_guide/values_files/).

You can get more information using the `describe` command in `kubectl`:

```sh
$ kubectl get deployments -n pgd-operator-system
NAME                READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
<deployment-name>   1/1     1            1           18m
```

```sh
kubectl describe deploy \
  -n pgd-operator-system \
  <deployment-name>
```

As with any deployment, it sits on top of a ReplicaSet and supports rolling upgrades. The
default configuration of the EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes operator is
a deployment of a single replica, which is suitable for most installations. If the
node where the pod is running isn't reachable anymore, the pod will be rescheduled on
another node.

If you require high availability at the operator level, it's possible to specify multiple
replicas in the deployment configuration, given that the operator supports leader election.
In addition, you can take advantage of taints and tolerations to make sure that the operator does
not run on the same nodes where the actual PostgreSQL clusters are running. (This might even
include the control plane for self-managed Kubernetes installations.)

!!! Seealso "Operator configuration"
    You can change the default behavior of the operator by overriding
    some default options. For more information, see
    ["Operator configuration"](operator_conf.md).

## Deploy PGD clusters

Be sure to create a cert issuer before you start deploying PGD clusters.
The Helm chart prompts you to do this, but in case you miss it,
you can run, for example:

```sh
kubectl apply -f \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EnterpriseDB/edb-postgres-for-kubernetes-charts/main/hack/samples/issuer-selfsigned.yaml
```

With the operators and a self-signed cert issuer deployed, you can start
creating PGD clusters. See
[Quick start](quickstart.md#part-3---deploy-a-pgd-cluster) for an example.

### Default operand images

By default, each operator release binds a default version and flavor for PGD and PGD Proxy images.
If the image names
aren't specified in the `spec.pgd.imageName` and `spec.pgdproxy.imageName` fields of the PGDGroup YAML file, the default
images are used.

You can overwrite default images using the `pgd-operator-controller-manager-config` operator configuration map.
For more details, see [EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes operator configuration](operator_conf.md#edb-postgres-distributed-for-kubernetes-operator-configuration).

Tiy can find the images the PGD cluster is using by checking the PGDGroup status:

```sh
kubectl get pgdgroup <pgdgroup name> -o yaml | yq ".status.image"
```

### Specifying operand images

This example shows a PGD cluster using explicit image names:

```yaml
apiVersion: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1beta1
kind: PGDGroup
metadata:
  name: group-example-customized
spec:
  instances: 2
  proxyInstances: 2
  witnessInstances: 1
  imageName: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-postgres-extended-pgd:17.5-pgd581-ubi9
  pgdProxy:
    imageName: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-pgd-proxy:5.8.1-ubi9
  imagePullSecrets:
  - name: registry-pullsecret
  pgd:
    parentGroup:
      name: world
      create: true
  cnp:
    storage:
      size: 1Gi
  pgdProxy:
    imageName: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-pgd-proxy:5.7.1-1
```

### Specifying operand images using ImageCatalog

Since the release of version 1.1.1, the PGD4K-PGD operator supports using `ImageCatalog` to specify operand images.

Different `ImageCatalogs` are available based on PGD versions for each PostgreSQL flavor.
Note that the image included in the `ImageCatalog` are ubi-9 based.

-   EDB Postgres Advanced PGD:
    <https://get.enterprisedb.io/pgd-k8s-image-catalogs/epas-k8s-enterprise-pgd->&lt;PGD_VERSION>-ubi9.yaml
-   EDB Postgres Extended PGD:
    <https://get.enterprisedb.io/pgd-k8s-image-catalogs/pgextended-k8s-enterprise-pgd->&lt;PGD_VERSION>-ubi9.yaml
-   Postgres Community PGD:
    <https://get.enterprisedb.io/pgd-k8s-image-catalogs/postgresql-k8s-enterprise-pgd->&lt;PGD_VERSION>-ubi9.yaml

You can create an `Imagecatalog` in the PGD cluster namespace and reference it in your YAML file.

This command creates an EDB Postgres Extended PGD 5.7 `ImageCatalog`:

```sh
kubectl create -f \
        https://get.enterprisedb.io/pgd-k8s-image-catalogs/epas-k8s-enterprise-pgd-5.8-ubi9.yaml
```

This example shows how to use the EDB Postgres Extended PGD 5.8 `ImageCatalog` to
specify a PostgreSQL major version of 17 for the PGD operand image. The PGD Proxy image is sourced from
the `ImageCatalog`.

```yaml
apiVersion: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1beta1
kind: PGDGroup
metadata:
  name: group-example-catalog
spec:
  instances: 2
  proxyInstances: 2
  witnessInstances: 1
  imageCatalogRef:
    apiGroup: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io
    kind: ImageCatalog
    major: 17
    name: epas-k8s-enterprise-pgd58-ubi9
...
```

## Operator upgrade

!!! Important

    Carefully read the [release notes](rel_notes/)
    before performing an upgrade, as some versions might
    require extra steps.

The EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes (PGD4K) operator relies on the
EDB Postgres for Kubernetes (PG4K) operator to manage clusters. To upgrade the EDB PGD4K
operator, the PG4K operator must also be upgraded to a supported version. We recommend
keeping the EDB PG4K operator on the [long-term support (LTS)](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/#long-term-support)
version, as this is the tested version compatible with the PGD4K operator.

To upgrade the EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) for Kubernetes operator:

1.  Upgrade the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator as a dependency.
2.  Upgrade the PGD4K controller and the related Kubernetes resources.

When you upgrade the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator, the instance manager on
each PGD node is also upgraded. For more details, see
[EDB Postgres for Kubernetes upgrades](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/installation_upgrade/#upgrades).

Unless differently stated in the release notes, those steps are normally done by applying the manifest of the newer version for plain Kubernetes installations.

### Compatibility among versions

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes (PGD4K) follows semantic versioning.
Every release of the operator within the same API version is compatible with the
previous one. The current API version is v1, corresponding to versions 1.x.y of
the operator.

The minor version of PGD4K operator is tracking a PG4K LTS release change.
For example:

-   PGD4K operator 1.0.x is fully tested against PG4K LTS 1.22.
-   PGD4K operator 1.1.x is fully tested against PG4K LTS 1.25.

A PGD4K operator release has the same support scope as the PG4K LTS release it's tracking.

In addition to new features, new versions of the operator contain bug fixes and
stability enhancements.

!!! Important
    Each version is released to maintain the most secure and stable
    Postgres environment. Because of this, we strongly encourage you to upgrade
    to the latest version of the operator.

The [release notes](rel_notes/) contains a detailed list of the
changes introduced in every released version of EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes.
Read them before upgrading to a newer version of the software.

Most versions are directly upgradable. In that case, applying the
newer manifest for plain Kubernetes installations will complete the upgrade.

When versions aren't directly upgradable, you must remove the old version (of both PGD4K and PG4K)
before installing the new one. This won't affect user data, only the operator.

### Upgrading to 1.0.1 on Red Hat OpenShift

On the OpenShift platform, starting from version 1.0.1, the EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes
operator is required to reference the LTS releases of the PG4K operator. For example,
PGD4K v1.0.1 specifically references the PG4K LTS version 1.22.x. (Any patch release of the 1.22 LTS branch is valid.)

To upgrade PGD4K operator, ensure that the PG4K operator is upgraded to a supported
version first. Only then can you upgrade the PGD4K operator.

!!! Important
    As PGD4K v1.0.0 doesn't require referencing an LTS release of the PG4K operator,
    it may have been installed with any PG4K version. If the installed PG4K version is
    less than 1.22, you can upgrade to PG4K version 1.22 by changing the subscription
    channel. For more information, see [Upgrading the operator](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/installation_upgrade/#upgrades). However, if the installed PG4K version
    is greater than 1.22, you must reinstall the operator from the stable-1.22
    channel to upgrade PGD4K to v1.0.1.

### Server-side apply of manifests

To ensure compatibility with Kubernetes 1.29 and upcoming versions,
EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes now mandates the use of
[server-side apply](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/using-api/server-side-apply/)
when deploying the operator manifest.

While employing this installation method poses no challenges for new
deployments, updating existing operator manifests using the `--server-side`
option may result in errors like the following:

```text
Apply failed with 1 conflict: conflict with "kubectl-client-side-apply" using..
```

If such errors arise, you can resolve them by explicitly specifying the
`--force-conflicts` option to enforce conflict resolution:

```sh
kubectl apply --server-side --force-conflicts -f <OPERATOR_MANIFEST>
```

From then on, `kube-apiserver` is acknowledged as a recognized
manager for the CRDs, eliminating the need for any further manual intervention
on this matter.

## Operand upgrade

Operand upgrades fall into two categories based on PostgreSQL and PGD versions:

-   Minor version upgrades (for example, PostgreSQL from 17.4 to 17.5 and PGD from 5.7 to 5.8)
-   Major version upgrades (for example, PostgreSQL from 16.x to 17.5, no PGD major version upgrade as only PGD 5.x is supported now)

!!! Note
    The PGD operand upgrade proceeds sequentially on each node. The node upgrade process
    is managed by the PG4K operator. For detailed information, see
    [PostgreSQL upgrades](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/postgres_upgrades/)

### Checking current PGD and proxy versions

Before upgrading, you can check the current PGD and PGD proxy versions:

```sh
kubectl get pgdgroup <pgdgroup name> -o yaml | yq ".status.image"
```

### Minor version upgrade

The PGD cluster supports in-place upgrades of the operand image's minor version,
though the PostgreSQL service is temporarily unavailable during the upgrade.

#### Upgrade procedure

-   Using default or customized image name:
    To upgrade the operand to a new minor version, replace the imageName in the
    `spec.imageName` and `spec.pgdproxy.imageName` sections of the PGD group YAML file with the new imageName.
    The images on each node will be upgraded sequentially and restarted accordingly.

-   Using image catalog:
    If the PGD cluster manages image versions using an `ImageCatalog`, upgrade the
    image version specified in the referenced `ImageCatalog`. The PGD cluster
    applies the new image version.

### Major version upgrade

Since release v1.1.2, the PGD4K operator supports in-place upgrades for major PostgreSQL versions.
During the process, each PGD node is upgraded sequentially, with the write leader transferred to an available node
before the upgrade.

#### Prerequisites for major version in-place upgrade

-   PGD4K operator v1.1.2 or higher
-   PG4K operator v1.26.0 or higher
-   PGD operand 5.8 or greater

#### Upgrade procedure

Like minor version upgrades, initiating a major version upgrade involves updating the `spec.imageName`
in the PGDGroup to point to the new operand image.

Example scenario:

Suppose you have a PGDGroup named `pgd-sample`, currently running with PostgreSQL 16.9
plus PGD 5.8.1. You plan to upgrade to PostgreSQL 17.5 plus PGD 5.8.1.

##### Step-by-step guidance

1.  Check the current operand version you're using:

```shell
kubectl -n pgd get pgdgroup pgd-sample -o yaml | yq ".status.image"
```

Output:

```shell
pgd: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-postgres-advanced-pgd:16.9-pgd581-ubi9
proxy: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-pgd-proxy:5.8.1-ubi9
```

2.  Update the operand image

Edit the PGDGroup and update the `spec.imageName` or patch it directly to
`docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-postgres-advanced-pgd:17.5-pgd581-ubi9`

```shell
kubectl patch pgdgroup pgd-sample -n pgd --patch \
'{"spec": {"imageName": "docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-postgres-advanced-pgd:17.5-pgd581-ubi9"}}' \
--type=merge
```

3.  Monitor the node-by-node major version upgrade

The cluster begins upgrading nodes sequentially:

Observe the upgrading node, for example, pgd-sample-3, shows "Upgrading Postgres major version".

```shell
> kubectl -n pgd get cluster
NAME           AGE    INSTANCES   READY   STATUS                             PRIMARY
pgd-sample-1   121m   1           1       Cluster in healthy state           pgd-sample-1-1
pgd-sample-2   118m   1           1       Cluster in healthy state           pgd-sample-2-1
pgd-sample-3   115m   1                   Upgrading Postgres major version   pgd-sample-3-1
```

During the process, the PGDGroup status is:

```shell
> kubectl -n pgd get pgdgroup
NAME         DATA INSTANCES   WITNESS INSTANCES   PHASE                                                         AGE
pgd-sample   2                1                   PGDGroup - Waiting for nodes to be ready   123m
```

The upgrade of individual nodes is managed via dedicated jobs:

```shell
> kubectl -n pgd get job
NAME                           STATUS    COMPLETIONS   DURATION   AGE
pgd-sample-3-1-major-upgrade   Running   0/1           3m22s      3m22s
```

Check logs in the upgrade job pod for detail upgrade status

```shell
kubectl -n pgd logs -f pgd-sample-3-1-major-upgrade-ldtnj
```

Once a node's major version upgrade completes, the process moves to the next node:

```shell
NAME           AGE    INSTANCES   READY   STATUS                             PRIMARY
pgd-sample-1   128m   1           1       Cluster in healthy state           pgd-sample-1-1
pgd-sample-2   125m   1                   Upgrading Postgres major version   pgd-sample-2-1
pgd-sample-3   122m   1           1       Cluster in healthy state           pgd-sample-3-1
```

4.  Confirm completion and health

Once all nodes are upgraded, the PGDGroup phase switches to Healthy.

```shell
NAME         DATA INSTANCES   WITNESS INSTANCES   PHASE                AGE
pgd-sample   2                1                   PGDGroup - Healthy   137m
```

Verify the overall image version:

```shell
kubectl -n pgd get pgdgroup  pgd-sample -o yaml | yq ".status.image"
```

Output:

```shell
pgd: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-postgres-advanced-pgd:17.5-pgd581-ubi9
proxy: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-pgd-proxy:5.8.1-ubi9
```

5. Confirm PostgreSQL version on each node:

```shell
kubectl -n pgd exec -it pgd-sample-1-1 -c postgres -- psql -c "select version()"
```

Output:

```
                                                                       version
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 PostgreSQL 17.5 (EnterpriseDB Advanced Server 17.5.0) on aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (GCC) 11.5.0 20240719 (Red Hat 11.5.0-5), 64-bit
