## Kubernetes

### Installation using Helm

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes can be installed using the provided
[Helm chart](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/edb-postgres-for-kubernetes-charts).

If you don't have [Helm](https://helm.sh) installed yet, please follow the
[instructions](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/quickstart/) to install it in your
system.

Assuming you have Helm installed, the first step is to add the repository:

```console
helm repo add edb https://enterprisedb.github.io/edb-postgres-for-kubernetes-charts/
```

You will need credentials to enable `helm` to retrieve the various
operator and operand images that are stored in private repositories.
Make sure to replace your username and password
in the command below:

```console
helm upgrade --dependency-update \
  --install edb-pg4k-pgd \
  --namespace pgd-operator-system \
  --create-namespace \
  edb/edb-postgres-distributed-for-kubernetes \
  --set image.imageCredentials.username=${REPO} \
  --set image.imageCredentials.password=${TOKEN}
```

Set `REPO` to either `k8s_enterprise_pgd` or `k8s_standard_pgd` depending on the EDB software subscription purchased and Postgres distribution to be installed. Use `k8s_enterprise_pgd` if you are a trialist or preview user.

Set `TOKEN` to the repository token for your EDB account. You can obtain this by going to the [Repos page](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads) on the EDB website, signing in (if necessary) and then and displaying the EDB Repos 2.0 token using the Reveal Token button or copying it using the Copy button.

For further details on the Helm chart, please refer to the
[Helm chart repo](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/edb-postgres-for-kubernetes-charts).

    Please carefully read the [release notes](release_notes.md)
    before performing an upgrade as some versions might require
    extra steps.

## Red Hat OpenShift

### Installation via web console

The EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes operator can be found in the Red Hat OperatorHub
directly from your OpenShift dashboard.

1.  Navigate in the web console to the `Operators -> OperatorHub` page:

    ![Menu OperatorHub](./images/openshift/operatorhub_1.png)

2.  Use the search box to restrict the listing, e.g. using `EDB` or `pgd`:

    ![Install OperatorHub](./images/openshift/find-pgd-openshift.png)

3.  Read the information about the Operator and select `Install`.

4.  The following `Operator installation` page expects you to choose:

    -   the installation mode: [cluster-wide](#cluster-wide-installation) is the
        only mode at the moment.
    -   the update channel (at the moment `alpha`)
    -   the approval strategy, following the availability on the market place of
        a new release of the operator, certified by Red Hat:
        -   `Automatic`: OLM automatically upgrades the running operator with the
            new version
        -   `Manual`:  OpenShift waits for human intervention, by requiring an
            approval in the `Installed Operators` section

#### Cluster-wide installation

With cluster-wide installation, you are asking OpenShift to install the
Operator in the default `openshift-operators` namespace and to make it
available to all the projects in the cluster. This is the default and normally
recommended approach to install EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes.

From the web console, select `All namespaces on the cluster (default)` as
`Installation mode`:

![Install all namespaces](./images/openshift/all-namespaces.png)

As a result, the operator will be visible in every namespace. Otherwise, as with any
other OpenShift operator, check the logs in any pods in the `openshift-operators`
project on the `Workloads → Pods` page that are reporting issues to troubleshoot further.

!!! Important "Beware"
    By choosing the cluster-wide installation you cannot easily move to a
    single project installation at a later time.

### Creating a PGD cluster

After the installation from OpenShift, you should find the operator deployment
in the `openshift-operators` namespace. Notice the cert-manager operator will
also get installed.

```sh
$ oc get deployments -n openshift-operators
NAME                                            READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
cert-manager-operator                           1/1     1            1           11m
pgd-operator-controller-manager                 1/1     1            1           11m
postgresql-operator-controller-manager-1-20-0   1/1     1            1           23h
…
```

Checking that the `pgd-operator-controller-manager` deployment is READY, we can
start creating PGD clusters. See [Examples of configuration](samples.md) for sample files.

Remember to deploy your PGD clusters on a dedicated namespace. The default
namespace is reserved.

First then, you should create a new namespace, and deploy a self-signed
certificate `Issuer` in it:

```sh
oc create ns my-namespace
oc apply -f hack/samples/issuer-selfsigned.yaml -n my-namespace
```

Now you can deploy a PGD cluster, for example a flexible 3-region, which
contains two data groups and a witness group:

```sh
oc apply -f docs/src/samples/flexible_3regions.yaml -n my-namespace
```

You should start seeing your PGD groups come up:

```sh
$ oc get pgdgroups -n my-namespace
NAME       DATA INSTANCES   WITNESS INSTANCES   PHASE                PHASE DETAILS   AGE
region-a   2                1                   PGDGroup - Healthy                   23m
region-b   2                1                   PGDGroup - Healthy                   23m
region-c   0                1                   PGDGroup - Healthy                   23m
```
