This section covers the main architectural aspects you need to consider
when deploying EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes (PG4K-PGD).

PG4K-PGD can be installed within a [single Kubernetes cluster](#single-kubernetes-cluster)
or across [multiple Kubernetes clusters](#multiple-kubernetes-clusters) - normally
in different regions.

## Relationship with EDB Postgres for Kubernetes

A PGD cluster is made up by one or more PGD groups, each having one or more PGD
nodes. A PGD node in Kubernetes can be assimilated to a Postgres cluster
without any physical replicas.
PG4K-PGD internally manages each PGD node using the `Cluster` resource as
defined by EDB Postgres for Kubernetes (PG4K), specifically a `Cluster` with
`.spec.instances = 1`.

The PostgreSQL instances created by the `Cluster` can be configured in the
[`.spec.cnp` section](api_reference.md#CnpConfiguration).

## Single Kubernetes cluster

EDB Postgres Distributed can be executed inside a single Kubernetes cluster.

## Multiple Kubernetes clusters

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes can also be deployed in different
Kubernetes clusters that can reliably communicate with each other.
More information can be found in the ["Connectivity"](connectivity.md) section.
