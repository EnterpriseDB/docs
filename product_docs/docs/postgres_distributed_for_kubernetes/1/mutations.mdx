SQLMutations consist of a list of SQL queries to be executed on the application
database via the superuser role after a pgd node joins the pgdgroup. Each
SQLMutation includes an `isApplied` list of queries and an `exec` list of
queries.
The `isApplied` SQL queries are used to check if the mutation has already been
applied. If any of the `isApplied` queries return false, the `exec` list of SQL
queries will be added to the execution queue.

Here is a sample of SQLMutations

```yaml
apiVersion: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1beta1
kind: PGDGroup
[...]
spec:
  pgd:
    mutations:
      - isApplied:
          - |
             WITH node_route_config AS (
               SELECT node_name, route_dsn
               FROM bdr.node_routing_config_summary
             )
            SELECT NOT EXISTS(SELECT * FROM node_route_config WHERE regexp_count(route_dsn, 'application_name=') >= 1);
        exec:
          - |
            WITH node_route_config AS (
              SELECT node_name,
                     regexp_replace(route_dsn, concat(' application_name=',  node_name), '') as route_dsn
              FROM bdr.node_routing_config_summary
            )
            SELECT bdr.alter_node_option(node_name, 'route_dsn', route_dsn)
            FROM node_route_config;

```

## SQLMutation Types

The operator offers three types of SQLMutations, which can be specified by `spec.pgd.mutations[].type`, with `always`
being the default option.

-   beforeSubgroupRaft
-   always
-   writeLeader

The `beforeSubgroupRaft` and `always` mutations are evaluated in every reconcile loop. The difference between
the two mutations lies in their execution phase:

-   For `always` mutations, they are run in each reconcile loop without any restrictions on the pgdgroup.
-   On the other hand, `beforeSubgroupRaft` mutations are only executed if the pgdgroup has defined data nodes
    and pgd proxies, and specifically before the subgroup raft becomes ready.

Both `beforeSubgroupRaft` and `always` mutations can run on any pgd node within the pgdgroup, including witness nodes.
Therefore, they should not be used for making data changes to the application database, as witness nodes do not contain
application database data.

The `writeLeader` mutation is triggered and executed after the write leader is elected. The `exec` operations
are carried out exclusively on the write leader node.
