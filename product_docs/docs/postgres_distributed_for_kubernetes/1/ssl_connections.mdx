    See [Certificates](certificates.md)
    for more details on how EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes supports TLS certificates.

The EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes operator was designed to work with TLS/SSL for both encryption in transit and
authentication on server and client sides. PGD nodes are created as cluster
resources using the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes operator. This
includes deploying a certification
authority (CA) to create and sign TLS client certificates.

See the [EDB Postgres for Kubernetes documentation](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/ssl_connections/)
for more information on issuers and certificates.
