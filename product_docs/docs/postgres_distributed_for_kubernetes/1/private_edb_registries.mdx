The images for the EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes and EDB Postgres for
Kubernetes operators, as well as various operands, are kept in private
container image registries under `docker.enterprisedb.com`.

!!! Important
    Access to the private registries requires an account with EDB and is
    reserved for EDB customers with a valid [subscription plan](https://www.enterprisedb.com/products/plans-comparison#selfmanagedenterpriseplan).
    Credentials are run through your EDB account.
    For trials, see [Trials](#trials).

## Which repository to choose?

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes is available as part of the Extreme
High Availability Add-On on top of either the EDB Enterprise Plan or EDB
Standard Plan.

Depending on your subscription plan, EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes
is in one of the following repositories.

| Plan                               | Repository           |
| ---------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| EDB Standard Plan (standard)       | `k8s_standard_pgd`   |
| EDB EnterpriseDB Plan (enterprise) | `k8s_enterprise_pgd` |

The name of the repository shall be used as the Username when you try to login
to the EDB container registry, for example through `docker login` or a
[`kubernetes.io/dockerconfigjson` pull secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/#secret-types).

!!! Important
    Each repository contains all the images you can access with your plan.
    You don't need to connect to different repositories to access different
    images, such as operator or operand images.

## How to retrieve the token

In the [repositories page in EDB](https://www.enterprisedb.com/repos-downloads),
you'll find an *EDB Repos 2.0* section where a `Repo Token` is shown, obscured.
The same token is also available in your
[Account profile](https://www.enterprisedb.com/accounts/profile), labeled
as `Repos 2.0 token`.

Next to the token you'll find a button to copy the token, and an eye icon
in case you want to view the content of the token as clear text.
The token shall be used as the *Password* when you try to access the EDB
container registry.

### Example with `docker login`

You can log in using Docker from your terminal. We suggest that you
copy the repo token using **Copy Token**. The `docker` command prompts you for a username and a password.

The username is the repo you're trying to access,
and the password is the token you just copied:

```sh
$ docker login docker.enterprisedb.com
Username: k8s_enterprise_pgd
Password:
Login Succeeded
```

## Trials

If you're a trialist or a preview user, use `k8s_enterprise_pgd` as the name
of the repository, and follow the instructions in
[How to retrieve the token](#how-to-retrieve-the-token) for the token.

## Operand images

### Operand distributions

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes is an operator that supports running
EDB Postgres Distributed (PGD) version 5 on three PostgreSQL distributions:

-   PostgreSQL
-   EDB Postgres Advanced Server (EPAS)
-   EDB Postgres Extended (PGE)

!!! Important
    See [Choosing a Postgres distribution](/pgd/latest/planning/choosing_server/)
    in the PGD documentation for details and a comparison of PGD on the
    different supported PostgreSQL distributions.

Due to the immutable application container adoption in EDB operators, the
operator expects the container images to include all the binaries required
to run the requested version of PGD on top of the required distribution and
version of Postgres.

These images follow the requirements and the conventions described in
[Container image requirements](/postgres_for_kubernetes/latest/container_images/)
in the EDB Postgres for Kubernetes documentation, adding the `bdr5`
extension.

The table shows the image name prefix for each Postgres distribution.

| Postgres distribution | Versions | Image name                | Repositories                             |
| --------------------- | -------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| PostgreSQL            | 13 - 17  | postgresql-pgd            | `k8s_standard_pgd`, `k8s_enterprise_pgd` |
| EDB Postgres Extended | 13 - 17  | edb-postgres-extended-pgd | `k8s_standard_pgd`, `k8s_enterprise_pgd` |
| EDB Postgres Advanced | 13 - 17  | edb-postgres-advanced-pgd | `k8s_enterprise_pgd`                     |

### Identifying image names

You can select a specific operand and proxy image version that's appropriate
for your Postgres distribution.

#### Operand image name

The operand image name is composed of the Postgres distribution, EDB Postgres Distributed key word,
their version numbers, and the build version.

**Postgres type:** The first part of the image name is the Postgres distribution you're using.
The table shows how Postgres types correspond to this part of the image name.

| Postgres distribution        | Image name              |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| EDB Postgres Advanced Server | `edb-postgres-advanced` |
| EDB Postgres Extended Server | `edb-postgres-extended` |
| PostgreSQL                   | `postgresql`            |

**EDB Postgres Distributed:** For all environment configurations, `pgd` is the
next part of the image name.

**Version numbers:** The versions of the Postgres distribution and PGD extension,
separated by a dash, are next in the image name.

**Build version:** The value reflects the current build, for example, 1. EDB creates
new builds to include security patches.

These identifiers, together with their versions, form the operand image name. The table shows some examples.

| Postgres version             | EDB Postgres Distributed version | Build | Operand image name                       |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- | ----- | ---------------------------------------- |
| EDB Postgres Advanced 16.6.0 | PGD 5.6.1                        | 1     | edb-postgres-advanced-pgd:16.6.0-5.6.1-1 |
| EDB Postgres Extended 15.10  | PGD 5.6.1                        | 1     | edb-postgres-extended-pgd:15.10-5.6.1-1  |
| PostgreSQL 16.6              | PGD 5.6.1                        | 1     | postgresql-pgd:16.6-5.6.1-1              |

!!! Note Postgres version format
    For PostgreSQL and EDB Extended Server images, the Postgres version is in `x.y` format,
    for example, 15.6. For EDB Postgres Advanced Server, the Postgres version is in `x.y.z`
    format, for example, 15.6.2.

For an overview of Postgres compatibility, see [Platform compatibility](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility).

#### Proxy image name

The proxy image name and version derive from EDB Postgres Distributed.
See the [EDB Postgres Distributed release notes](/pgd/latest/rel_notes/)
for an overview of PGD versions and corresponding PGD proxy versions. The table shows an example.

| Proxy version   | Proxy image name    |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| PGD Proxy 5.6.0 | edb-pgd-proxy:5.6.0 |

!!! Note ubi-9 operand image
    By default, all operand and proxy image are ubi-8 based, if you want to have ubi-9
    based image, append the `-ubi9` suffix to the operand image name and proxy image name.

## Customize Operand images

You can customize the default operand images for the EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes operator,
and these changes will apply to all future PGDGroup creations. Additionally,  you have the option to
customize the operand for each individual PGDGroup deployment.

### Customize Default Operand Images in Helm Chart Deployment

Use the following Helm chart command to deploy the EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes operator
with customized operand and proxy names. Please note that all operand and operator images will be
pulled from the same private repository defined by `global.repository`. For more information,
visit the [Helm chart](https://github.com/EnterpriseDB/edb-postgres-for-kubernetes-charts) page.

```sh
helm upgrade --dependency-update \
  --install edb-pg4k-pgd \
  --namespace pgd-operator-system \
  --create-namespace \
  edb/edb-postgres-distributed-for-kubernetes \
  --set global.repository=docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_${EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN}_pgd \
  --set global.pgdImageName=${EDB_PGD_IMAGE_NAME} \
  --set global.proxyImageName=${EDB_PROXY_IMAGE_NAME} \
  --set image.imageCredentials.username=k8s_${EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_PLAN}_pgd \
  --set image.imageCredentials.password=${EDB_SUBSCRIPTION_TOKEN}
```

!!! Note
    With the above installation, the default operand and proxy image are configured in
    the operator's ConfigMap `pgd-operator-controller-manager-config`. For more information,
    please refer to the [Operator Configuration](operator_conf.md).

Hereâ€™s an example of the customization for:

-   Using `enterprise` subscription plan and pull images from the `k8s_enterprise_pgd` repository.
-   Use EDB Postgres Advanced Server 15.10.0 as the Postgres option.
-   Use PGD 5.6.1 as the Postgres Distributed version.
-   Use 5.6.0 as the PGD Proxy version.

```sh
helm upgrade --dependency-update \
    --install edb-pg4k-pgd \
    --namespace pgd-operator-system \
    --create-namespace \
    edb/edb-postgres-distributed-for-kubernetes \
    --set global.repository=docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd \
    --set global.pgdImageName=edb-postgres-advanced-pgd:15.10.0-5.6.1-1 \
    --set global.proxyImageName=edb-pgd-proxy:5.6.0 \
    --set image.imageCredentials.username=k8s_enterprise_pgd \
    --set image.imageCredentials.password=<my_registry_token>
```

### Update Default Operand Images for an Existing Operator

You can modify the default operand images by updating the `pgd-operator-controller-manager-config`
ConfigMap or Secret. For further details, please refer to the [Operator Configuration](operator_conf.md)
documentation.

### Customize Operand Images for Single PGDGroup Deployment

You can also customize operand and proxy image for a single PGDGroup deployment.
In this case, it's necessary to create the image pull secrets in the target namespace.
If you've already installed the EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes operator from the
private registry, you should have set up an image pull secret.

```sh
kubectl create secret docker-registry registry-pullsecret \
  -n <CLUSTER-NAMESPACE> --docker-server=docker.enterprisedb.com \
  --docker-username=<REGISTRY-NAME> \
  --docker-password=<TOKEN>
```

As mentioned earlier, the `docker-username` corresponds to your registry name, such as
`k8s_standard_pgd` or `k8s_enterprise_pgd`, while the `docker-password` is the token
obtained from the [EDB portal](#how-to-retrieve-the-token).

After creating your pull secret, ensure you set the `imagePullSecrets` field
in the PGD group manifest, along with the `imageName`. The manifest below will create
a PGD group running PG Extended from the `k8s_enterprise_pgd` repository.

```yaml
apiVersion: pgd.k8s.enterprisedb.io/v1beta1
kind: PGDGroup
metadata:
  name: group-example-pge
spec:
  instances: 2
  proxyInstances: 2
  witnessInstances: 1
  imageName: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-postgres-extended-pgd:15.10-5.6.1-1
  imagePullSecrets:
  - name: registry-pullsecret
  pgdProxy:
    imageName: docker.enterprisedb.com/k8s_enterprise_pgd/edb-pgd-proxy:5.6.0
  pgd:
    parentGroup:
      name: world
      create: true
  cnp:
    storage:
      size: 1Gi
```
