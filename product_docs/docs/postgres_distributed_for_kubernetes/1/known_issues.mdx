title: 'Known issues and limitations'
---

These known issues and limitations are in the current release of EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes. 

## Postgres major version upgrades

This version of EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes **doesn't support** major version upgrades of Postgres.

## Data migration

This version of EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes **doesn't support** migrating from existing Postgres databases.

## Connectivity with PgBouncer

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes **does not support** using [PgBouncer](/pgbouncer/latest/) to pool client connection requests. 
This limitation applies to both the open-source and EDB versions of PgBouncer.

## Backup operations

To configure an EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes environment, you must apply a `PGDGroup` YAML object to each Kubernetes cluster. Applying this object
creates all necessary services for implementing a distributed architecture. 

If you added a `spec.backup` section to this `PGDGroup` object with the goal of setting up a backup configuration, 
the backup will fail unless you also set the `spec.backup.cron.schedule` value. 

Error output example:

```
The PGDGroup "region-a" is invalid: spec.backup.cron.schedule: Invalid value: "": Empty spec string
```

### Workaround

To work around this issue, add a `spec.backup.cron.schedule` section with a schedule that meets your requirements, for example: 

```yaml
spec:  
  instances: 3  
  proxyInstances: 2  
  pgd:  
    parentGroup:  
      create: true  
      name: world  
  backup:  
    configuration:  
      barmanObjectStore:  
        ...  
    cron:  
      suspend: false  
      immediate: true  
      schedule: "0 */5 * * * *"
```

## Known issues and limitations in EDB Postgres Distributed

All issues and limitations known for the EDB Postgres Distributed version that you include in your deployment also affect 
your EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes instance.

For example, if the EDB Postgres Distributed version you're using is the latest, your EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes 
instance will be affected by these [latest known issues](/pgd/latest/known_issues/) and [limitations](/pgd/latest/planning/limitations/).
