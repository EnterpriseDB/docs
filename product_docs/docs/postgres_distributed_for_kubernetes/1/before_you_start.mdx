Before you get started, review the terminology that's
specific to Kubernetes and PGD.

## Kubernetes terminology

[Node](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/architecture/nodes/)
: A *node* is a worker machine in Kubernetes, either virtual or physical, where
  all services necessary to run pods are managed by the control plane nodes.

[Pod](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod/)
: A *pod* is the smallest computing unit that can be deployed in a Kubernetes
  cluster and is composed of one or more containers that share network and
  storage.

[Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/)
: A *service* is an abstraction that exposes as a network service an
  application that runs on a group of pods and standardizes important features,
  such as service discovery across applications, load balancing, and failover.

[Secret](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/)
: A *secret* is an object that's designed to store small amounts of sensitive
  data such as passwords, access keys, or tokens and use them in pods.

[Storage class](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/storage-classes/)
: A *storage class* allows an administrator to define the classes of storage in
  a cluster, including provisioner (such as AWS EBS), reclaim policies, mount
  options, volume expansion, and so on.

[Persistent volume](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/)
: A *persistent volume* (PV) is a resource in a Kubernetes cluster that
  represents storage that was either manually provisioned by an
  administrator or dynamically provisioned by a *storage class* controller. A PV
  is associated with a pod using a *persistent volume claim*, and its lifecycle is
  independent of any pod that uses it. Normally, a PV is a network volume,
  especially in the public cloud. A [*local persistent volume*
  (LPV)](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local) is a
  persistent volume that exists only on the particular node where the pod that
  uses it is running.

[Persistent volume claim](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#persistentvolumeclaims)
: A *persistent volume claim* (PVC) represents a request for storage, which
  might include size, access mode, or a particular storage class. Similar to how
  a pod consumes node resources, a PVC consumes the resources of a PV.

[Namespace](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/)
: A *namespace* is a logical and isolated subset of a Kubernetes cluster and
  can be seen as a *virtual cluster* within the wider physical cluster.
  Namespaces allow administrators to create separated environments based on
  projects, departments, teams, and so on.

[RBAC](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/rbac/)
: *Role-based access control* (RBAC), also known as *role-based security*, is a
  method used in computer systems security to restrict access to the network and
  resources of a system to authorized users only. Kubernetes has a native API to
  control roles at the namespace and cluster level and associate them with
  specific resources and individuals.

[CRD](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/)
: A *custom resource definition* (CRD) is an extension of the Kubernetes API
  and allows developers to create new data types and objects, called *custom
  resources*.

[Operator](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/operator/)
: An *operator* is a Kubernetes software extension that automates those steps
  that are normally performed by a human operator when managing one or more
  applications or given services. An operator assists Kubernetes in making sure
  that the resource's defined state always matches the observed one.

[`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/overview/)
: `kubectl` is the command-line tool used to manage a Kubernetes cluster.

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes requires a Kubernetes version supported by the community. See
[Supported releases](https://www.enterprisedb.com/resources/platform-compatibility#pgdk8s) for details.

## PGD terminology

For more information, see
[Terminology](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/terminology/) in the PGD documentation.

[Node](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/terminology/#node)
: A PGD database instance.

[Failover](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/terminology/#failover)
: The automated process that recognizes a failure in a highly available database cluster and takes action to connect the application to another active database.

[Switchover](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/terminology/#switchover)
: A planned change in connection between the application and the active database node in a cluster, typically done for maintenance.

[Write leader](https://www.enterprisedb.com/docs/pgd/latest/terminology/#write-leader)
: In Always On architectures, a node is selected as the correct connection endpoint for applications. This node is called the *write leader*. The write leader is selected by consensus of a quorum of proxy nodes.

## Cloud terminology

Region
: A *region* in the cloud is an isolated and independent geographic area
  organized in *availability zones*. Zones within a region have very little
  round-trip network latency.

Zone
: An *availability zone* in the cloud (also known as a *zone*) is an area in a
  region where resources can be deployed. Usually, an availability zone
  corresponds to a data center or an isolated building of the same data center.

## What to do next

Now that you have familiarized with the terminology, you can

deploying the operator in your selected cloud environment.
