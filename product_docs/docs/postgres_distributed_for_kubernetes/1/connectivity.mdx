Information about secure network communications in a
PGD cluster includes:

-   [Services](#services)
-   [Domain names resolution](#domain-names-resolution) using fully qualified domain names (FQDN)
-   [TLS configuration](#tls-configuration)

!!! Note Notice
    Although these topics might seem unrelated to each other, they all
    participate in the configuration of the PGD resources to make them universally
    identifiable and accessible over a secure network.

## Services

Resources in a PGD cluster are accessible through Kubernetes services.
Every PGD group manages several of them, namely:

-   One service per node, used for internal communications (*node service*).
-   A *group service* to reach any node in the group, used primarily by EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes
    to discover a new group in the cluster.
-   A *proxy service* to enable applications to reach the write leader of the
    group transparently using PGD Proxy.
-   A *proxy-r service* to enable applications to reach the read nodes of the
    group transparently using PGD Proxy. This service is disabled by default
    and controlled by the `.spec.proxySettings.enableReadNodeRouting` setting.

For an example that uses these services, see [Connecting an application to a PGD cluster](#connecting-to-a-pgd-cluster-from-an-application).

![Basic architecture of an EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes PGD group](./images/pg4k-pgd-basic-architecture.png)

Each service is generated from a customizable template in the `.spec.connectivity`
section of the manifest.

All services must be reachable using their FQDN
from all the PGD nodes in all the Kubernetes clusters. See [Domain names resolution](#domain-names-resolution).

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes provides a service templating framework that gives you the
availability to easily customize services at the following three levels:

Node Service Template
:   Each PGD node is reachable using a service that can be configured in the
    `.spec.connectivity.nodeServiceTemplate` section.

Group Service Template
:   Each PGD group has a group service that's a single entry point for the
    whole group and that can be configured in the
    `.spec.connectivity.groupServiceTemplate` section.

Proxy Service Template
:   Each PGD group has a proxy service to reach the group write leader through
    the PGD proxy and can be configured in the `.spec.connectivity.proxyServiceTemplate`
    section. This is the entry-point service for the applications.

Proxy Read Service Template
:   Each PGD group has a proxy service to reach the group read nodes through
    the PGD proxy. Can be enabled by `.spec.proxySettings.enableReadNodeRouting`,
    and can be configured in the `.spec.connectivity.proxyReadServiceTemplate`
    section. This is the entry-point service for the applications.

You can use templates to create a LoadBalancer service or to add arbitrary
annotations and labels to a service to integrate with other components
available in the Kubernetes system (that is, to create external DNS names or tweak
the generated load balancer).

## Domain names resolution

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes ensures that all resources in a PGD group have a FQDN by adopting a convention that uses the PGD group name as a prefix
for all of them.

As a result, it expects you to define the domain name of the PGD group. This
can be done through the `.spec.connectivity.dns` section, which controls how the
FQDN for the resources are generated with two fields:

-   `domain` &mdash; Domain name for all the objects in the PGD group to use (mandatory).
-   `hostSuffix` &mdash; Suffix to add to each service in the PGD group (optional).

## TLS configuration

EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes requires that resources in a PGD cluster communicate over a secure
connection. It relies on PostgreSQL's native support for [SSL connections](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html)
to encrypt client/server communications using TLS protocols for increased
security.

Currently, EDB Postgres Distributed for Kubernetes requires that [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) is installed.
Cert-manager was chosen as the tool to provision dynamic certificates
given that it's widely recognized as the standard in a Kubernetes
environment.

The `spec.connectivity.tls` section describes how the communication between the
nodes happens:

-   `mode` is an enumeration describing how the server certificates are verified
    during PGD group nodes communication. It accepts the following values, as
    documented in [SSL Support](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html#LIBPQ-SSL-SSLMODE-STATEMENTS)
    in the PostgreSQL documentation:

    -   `verify-full`
    -   `verify-ca`
    -   `required`

-   `serverCert` defines the server certificates used by the PGD group nodes to
    accept requests.
    The clients validate this certificate depending on the passed TLS mode.
    It accepts the same values as `mode`.

-   `clientCert` defines the `streaming_replica` user certificate
    used by the nodes to authenticate each other.

### Server TLS configuration

The server certificate configuration is specified in the `.spec.connectivity.tls.serverCert.certManager`
section of the `PGDGroup` custom resource.

The following assumptions were made for this section to work:

-   An issuer `.spec.connectivity.tls.serverCert.certManager.issuerRef` is available
    for the domain `.spec.connectivity.dns.domain` and any other domain used by
    `.spec.connectivity.tls.serverCert.certManager.altDnsNames`.
-   There's a secret containing the public certificate of the CA
    used by the issuer `.spec.connectivity.tls.serverCert.caCertSecret`.

The `.spec.connectivity.tls.serverCert.certManager` is used to create a per-node
cert-manager certificate request.
The resulting certificate is used by the underlying Postgres instance
to terminate TLS connections.

The operator adds the following altDnsNames to the certificate:

-   `$node$hostSuffix.$domain`
-   `$groupName$hostSuffix.$domain`

!!! Important
    It's your responsibility to add to `.spec.connectivity.tls.serverCert.certManager.altDnsNames`
    any name required from the underlying networking architecture,
    for example, load balancers used by the user to reach the nodes.

### Client TLS configuration

The operator requires client certificates to be dynamically provisioned
using cert-manager (the recommended approach) or pre-provisioned using secrets.

#### Dynamic provisioning via cert-manager

The client certificates configuration is managed by the `.spec.connectivity.tls.clientCert.certManager`
section of the `PGDGroup` custom resource.
The following assumptions were made for this section to work:

-   An issuer `.spec.connectivity.tls.clientCert.certManager.issuerRef` is available
    and signs a certificate with the common name `streaming_replica`.
-   There's a secret containing the public certificate of the CA
    used by the issuer `.spec.connectivity.tls.clientCert.caCertSecret`.

The operator uses the configuration under `.spec.connectivity.tls.clientCert.certManager`
to create a certificate request per the `streaming_replica` Postgres user.
The resulting certificate is used to secure communication between the nodes.

#### Pre-provisioned certificates via secrets

Alternatively, you can specify a secret containing the pre-provisioned
client certificate for the streaming replication user through the
`.spec.connectivity.tls.clientCert.preProvisioned.streamingReplica.secretRef` option.
The certificate lifecycle in this case is managed entirely by a third party,
either manually or automated, by updating the content of the secret.

## Connecting to a PGD cluster from an application

Connecting to a PGD group from an application running inside the same Kubernetes cluster
or from outside the cluster is a simple procedure. In both cases, you connect to
the proxy service of the PGD group as the `app` user. The proxy service is a LoadBalancer
service that routes the connection to the write leader or read nodes of the PGD group,
depending on the proxy service it's connecting to. 

### Connecting from inside the cluster

When connecting from inside the cluster, you can use the proxy service name to connect
to the PGD group. The proxy service name is composed of the PGD group name and the optional
host suffix defined in the `.spec.connectivity.dns` section of the `PGDGroup` custom resource.

For example, if the PGD group name is `my-group`, and the host suffix is `.my-domain.com`,
the proxy service name is `my-group.my-domain.com`.

Before connecting, you need to get the password for the app user from the app user
secret. The naming format of the secret is `my-group-app` for a PGD group named `my-group`.

You can get the username and password from the secret using the following commands:

```sh
kubectl get secret my-group-app -o jsonpath='{.data.username}' | base64 --decode
kubectl get secret my-group-app -o jsonpath='{.data.password}' | base64 --decode
```

With this, you have all the pieces for a connection string to the PGD group:

```text
postgresql://<app-user>:<app-password>@<proxy-service-name>:5432/<database>
```

Or, for a `psql` invocation:

```sh
psql -U <app-user> -h <proxy-service-name> <database>
```

Where `app-user` and `app-password` are the values you got from the secret,
and `database` is the name of the database you want to connect
to. (The default is `app` for the app user.)

### Connecting from outside the Kubernetes cluster

When connecting from outside the Kubernetes cluster, in the general case,
the [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) resource or a [load balancer](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#loadbalancer) is necessary.
Check your cloud provider or local installation for more information about their
behavior in your environment.

Ingresses and load balancers require a pod selector to forward connection to
the PGD proxies. When configuring them, we suggest using the following labels:

-   `k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/group` &mdash; Set the PGD group name.
-   `k8s.pgd.enterprisedb.io/workloadType` &mdash; Set to `pgd-proxy`.

If using Kind or other solutions for local development, the easiest way to
access the PGD group from outside is to use port forwarding
to the proxy service. You can use the following command to forward port 5432 on your
local machine to the proxy service:

```sh
kubectl port-forward svc/my-group.my-domain.com 5432:5432
```

Where `my-group.my-domain.com` is the proxy service name from the previous example.
