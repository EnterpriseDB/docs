This section provides information about secure network communications within a
PGD Cluster, covering the following topics:

-   [services](#services)
-   [domain names resolution](#domain-names-resolution) using fully qualified domain names (FQDN)
-   [TLS configuration](#tls-configuration)

!!! Note
    Although the above topics might seem unrelated to each other, they all
    participate in the configuration of the PGD resources to make them universally
    identifiable and accessible over a secure network.

## Services

Resources in a PGD Cluster are accessible through Kubernetes services.
Every PGDGroup manages several of them, namely:

-   one service per node, used for internal communications (*node service*)
-   a *group service*, to reach any node in the group, used primarily by PG4K-PGD
    to discover a new group in the cluster
-   a *proxy service*, to enable applications to reach the write leader of the
    group, transparently using PGD proxy

Each service is generated from a customizable template in the `.spec.connectivity`
section of the manifest.

All services must be reachable using their fully qualified domain name (FQDN)
from all the PGD nodes in all the Kubernetes clusters (see below in this
section).

PG4K-PGD provides a service templating framework that gives you the
availability to easily customize services at the following 3 levels:

Node Service Template
:   Each PGD node is reachable using a service which can be configured in the
    `.spec.connectivity.nodeServiceTemplate` section.

Group Service Template
:   Each PGD group has a group service that is a single entry point for the
    whole group and that can be configured in the
    `.spec.connectivity.groupServiceTemplate` section.

Proxy Service Template
:   Each PGD group has a proxy service to reach the group write leader through
    the PGD proxy, and can be configured in the `.spec.connectivity.proxyServiceTemplate`
    section. This is the entry-point service for the applications.

You can use templates to create a LoadBalancer service, and/or to add arbitrary
annotations and labels to a service in order to integrate with other components
available in the Kubernetes system (i.e. to create external DNS names or tweak
the generated load balancer).

## Domain names resolution

PG4K-PGD ensures that all resources in a PGD Group have a fully qualified
domain name (FQDN) by adopting a convention that uses the PGD Group name as a prefix
for all of them.

As a result, it expects that you define the domain name of the PGD Group. This
can be done through the `.spec.connectivity.dns` section which controls how the
FQDN for the resources are generated, with  two fields:

-   `domain`: domain name to be used by all the objects in the PGD group (mandatory);
-   `hostSuffix`: suffix to be added to each service in the PGD group (optional).

## TLS Configuration

<!-- TODO: Improve the narrative in this section -->

PG4K-PGD requires that resources in a PGD Cluster communicate over a secure
connection. It relies on PostgreSQL's native support for [SSL connections](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html)
to encrypt client/server communications using TLS protocols for increased
security.

Currently, PG4K-PGD requires that [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) is installed.
Cert-manager has been chosen as the tool to provision dynamic certificates,
given that it is widely recognized as the de facto standard in a Kubernetes
environment.

The `spec.connectivity.tls` section describes how the communication between the
nodes should happen:

-   `mode` is an enumeration describing how the server certificates are verified
    during PGD group nodes communication. It accepts the following values, as
    documented in ["SSL Support"](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/libpq-ssl.html#LIBPQ-SSL-SSLMODE-STATEMENTS)
    from the PostgreSQL documentation:

    -   `verify-full`
    -   `verify-ca`
    -   `required`

-   `serverCert` defines the server certificates used by the PGD group nodes to
    accept requests.
    The clients validate this certificate depending on the passed TLS mode;
    refer to the previous point for the accepted values.

-   `clientCert` defines the `streaming_replica` user certificate that will
    be used by the nodes to authenticate each other.

### Server TLS Configuration

The server certificate configuration is specified in `.spec.connectivity.tls.serverCert.certManager`
section of the PGDGroup custom resource.

The following assumptions have been made for this section to work:

-   An issuer `.spec.connectivity.tls.serverCert.certManager.issuerRef` is available
    for the domain `.spec.connectivity.dns.domain` and any other domain used by
    `.spec.connectivity.tls.serverCert.certManager.altDnsNames`
-   There is a secret containing the public certificate of the CA
    used by the issuer `.spec.connectivity.tls.serverCert.caCertSecret`

The `.spec.connectivity.tls.serverCert.certManager` is used to create a per node
cert-manager certificate request
The resulting certificate will be used by the underlying Postgres instance
to terminate TLS connections.

The operator will add the following altDnsNames to the certificate:

-   `$node$hostSuffix.$domain`
-   `$groupName$hostSuffix.$domain`

!!! Important
    It's your responsibility to add in `.spec.connectivity.tls.serverCert.certManager.altDnsNames`
    any name required from the underlying networking architecture
    (e.g., load balancers used by the user to reach the nodes).

### Client TLS Configuration

The operator requires client certificates to be dynamically provisioned
via cert-manager (recommended approach) or pre-provisioned via secrets.

#### Dynamic provisioning via Cert-manager

The client certificates configuration is managed by `.spec.connectivity.tls.clientCert.certManager`
section of the PGDGroup custom resource.
The following assumptions have been made for this section to work:

-   An issuer `.spec.connectivity.tls.clientCert.certManager.issuerRef` is available
    and will sign a certificate with the common name `streaming_replica`
-   There is a secret containing the public certificate of the CA
    used by the issuer `.spec.connectivity.tls.clientCert.caCertSecret`

The operator will use the configuration under `.spec.connectivity.tls.clientCert.certManager`
to create a certificate request per the `streaming_replica` Postgres user.
The resulting certificate will be used to secure communication between the nodes.

#### Pre-provisioned certificates via secrets

Alternatively, you can specify a secret containing the pre-provisioned
client certificate for the streaming replication user through the
`.spec.connectivity.tls.clientCert.preProvisioned.streamingReplica.secretRef` option.
The certificate lifecycle in this case is managed entirely by a third party,
either manually or automated, by simply updating the content of the secret.
